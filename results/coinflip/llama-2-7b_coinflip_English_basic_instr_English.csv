Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, the correct answer is Option B: No. The coin was initially heads up, but when Paulo flipped it, he reversed its orientation to tails side up. Then, Tatyana flipped it again, also reversing its orientation to the tails side up. Finally, Raul flipped it once more, so the coin is now heads up again. Therefore, the coin has changed sides at least twice, meaning it is no longer heads up.
