   The reason why some activists are boycotting certain products is because they have been tested on animals. This means that the products have been subjected to animal testing in order to ensure their safety and effectiveness before being sold to consumers. Many people find this practice unethical or cruel, as it involves using living creatures for scientific experimentation without their consent. As a result, these activists choose to boycott these products as a form of protest against animal testing. Therefore, option (A) is more likely to be the correct answer.

"   The most likely reason is (A) the country is celebrating its independence day. This is because the phrase ""treo cờ quốc gia"" means to raise the national flag, which is a common practice during Independence Day celebrations in many countries. Additionally, the context of the sentence suggests that the event is taking place outside of someone's home, which is also consistent with Independence Day celebrations where people often gather in public spaces such as parks or squares to display their national flags and participate in other festivities."

   Both options are possible causes for the manager to call the police. The customer could be using a fake bill or the customer could have turned on the lights in the store. Therefore, both options are equally likely and cannot be ruled out based solely on the given information.
