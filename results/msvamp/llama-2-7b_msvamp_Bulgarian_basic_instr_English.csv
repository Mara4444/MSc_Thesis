Now, let's find out how many girls are left in the school:
Total number of students in the school = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 732 + 761
= 1493

Now, we need to subtract the number of girls who joined the school from the total number of students:
Number of girls in the school now = Total number of students - Number of girls who joined
= 1493 - 682
= 811
Therefore, there are 811 girls in the school currently."

"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the question, Захари направи 53 оттискания and 14 скръчвания in gymnastics today. David made 17 more than Захари but 10 less than him. Therefore, Захари performed 26 отбина (оттискания) and 14 скръчвания (скрэчвания)."
"Response: 29
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Захари (Zachari) performed 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gymnastics today.
* Дейavid (David) performed 58 more pull-ups than Zachari.
* David performed 87 fewer push-ups than Zachari.

Now, let's calculate the difference between what Zachari did and what David did:

Difference = David's number of push-ups - Zachari's number of push-ups
= 58 - 35
= 23

So, David performed 23 more push-ups than Zachari."
"Response: 18
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Захари (Zachari) performed 46 push-ups and 58 crunches today.
* Дейavid (David) did 38 more pull-ups than Zachari, but 62 fewer push-ups than Zachari.

So, David performed 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups and 58 + 62 = 120 crunches.

Therefore, the difference between what Zachari performed and what David performed is:
Zachari's performance - David's performance = 46 - 84 = -38.

In other words, David performed 38 more push-ups than Zachari."
"Response: 42

From the information provided in the question, we know that:

* Захари (Zachari) made 19 push-ups today.
* Дейavid (David) made 39 more push-ups than Zachari.
* John made 13 fewer push-ups than David.

So, if David made 39 more push-ups than Zachari, and John made 13 fewer push-ups than David, then David must have made 52 push-ups (39 + 13 = 52)."
Response:  John will perform 39 push-ups today.

"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, after buying several books at a garage sale, Pol had 151 books left. If he started with 50 books, then he must have bought 35 more books at the garage sale."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books at a garage sale, he bought 150 new ones. If he had 58 books left, that means he sold 92 books (58 - 32 = 92)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, Pol had 21 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 42 new books, which means he has 42 - 21 = 21 more books than he originally had. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is 21."
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the question, Pol had 71 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, which means he had fewer books left. After buying 38 new books, he now has 116 books in total. So, the difference between the number of books he bought (38) and the number of books he sold (some) is equal to the number of books he already had (71) minus the number of books he currently has (116), which is 45. Therefore, Pol has bought 25 more books than he sold."
Response: 32 books were sold at the garage sale.
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, after selling some books and chemicals in the garage sale, Pol had 82 books and 14 chemicals left. If he sold 7 chemicals at the garage sale, then he must have sold 7 - 14 = -7 chemicals (since negative numbers indicate that he gave away more than he sold). Therefore, the number of chemicals he sold at the garage sale is 7."
"Response: 59

Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the following way:

Initial number of books = 136
Number of books sold at garage sale = 27

So, the person sold 59 books (109 / 2 = 59)."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the passage, after giving 39 books to his friend and selling some at a garage sale, Paul had 68 books left. If he sold 20 books at the garage sale, then he must have sold 20 - 39 = 21 books in total."
Response: 7 books were sold at the garage sale.
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, after selling several books and chemicals in the garage sale, Paul had 113 books and 19 chemicals left. If he sold 7 chemicals at the garage sale, as stated in the question, then he must have sold a total of 7 + 19 = 26 chemicals."

"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the question, Dan found 30 caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones, so he has 42 caps left. To find out how many caps Dan threw away, we need to subtract the number of caps he found from the total number of caps he had (42 - 30 = 18)."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Dan had 14 capuchins and packages at the beginning. This is because he found 22 capuchins and 8 packages in the park, which means he already had 14 capuchins and packages before going to the park. Then, he collected 28 more capuchins and 63 more packages, bringing his total number of capuchins to 28 and his total number of packages to 63."
Response:  Initially, Dan had 30 oversacks.
"Response: 23
Explanation: According to the question, Dawn found 30 capuchins and 14 packages in the park. Now, she has 7 capuchins and 86 packages in her collection.

Therefore, the answer is 23 (30 - 7)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Dawn found 11 capuchins and 28 packages in the park. Now, she has 68 capuchins and 51 packages in her collection. To find out how many more packages than capuchins Dan found in the park, we need to subtract the number of packages he found from the total number of packages she collected: 51 - 28 = 23. Therefore, Dan found 23 more packages than capuchins in the park."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Dawn had 71 capuchins and 24 packages in the park. Now, she has 28 capuchins and 16 packages in her collection.

Response:  There are currently 43 oversized boxes and 27 small caps in Dan's collection. Initially, there were 10 bottles and 62 packages in the park. Therefore, the number of packages that Dan has collected is: 43 - 27 = 16 more than the initial amount.
"Response: 31
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Dawn collected bottle caps.
* He lost 66 bottle caps in the park.
* Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection.

So, initially, Dawn had 31 bottle caps (25 - 66 = 31)."

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Dawn had 30 capuchins and 39 bottle caps at the beginning. Then, she found 82 bottle caps and 29 capuchins in the park. After collecting these items, Dawn had 42 capuchins and 61 bottle caps in her collection. Therefore, Dawn had 30 capuchins in the beginning."
"Response: 42

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is:

* Dawn has 66 ointment boxes and 39 bottle caps in the park.
* Now, she has 16 capacks and 68 ointment boxes in her collection.

From this information, we can deduce that Dawn had 42 ointment boxes in the beginning (68 - 26 = 42)."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Dawn found 46 packs and 50 bottles in the park. Now, she has 21 caps and 52 packages in her collection. To find out how many more caps he found for bottles, we need to subtract the number of caps he currently has from the total number of caps he found in the park: 50 - 21 = 39. Therefore, Dan found 39 more caps than bottles in the park."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, Daani had found 65 packages and caps in the park. Now he has 31 caps and 9 packages in his collection. To find out how many more packages than caps he found in the park, we need to subtract the number of packages he has now from the original number of packages he found: 65 - 9 = 56. So, Daani found 56 more packages than caps in the park."
Response:  There are currently 12 capuchins in Dan's collection + 58 capuchins found in the park = 70 total capuchins.
Response:  There are currently 67 oversacks and 35 capuchins in Dan's collection. If he had 15 capuchins and 18 overpacks before, that means he gained 20 overpacks (67 - 18 = 49) and 17 capuchins (35 - 15 = 20). So, there are now 49 more overpacks than capuchins in Dan's collection.

Explanation:
The question states that Dave had 21 applications on his phone and then added 89 new ones. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 applications.

"Response: 306
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nel had 528 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff, who now has 252 cards. To find out how many cards Nele gave to Jeff, we can subtract the number of cards Jeff already had (11) from the total number of cards Nele had (528): 528 - 11 = 497. So, Neel gave Jeff 497 cards."
"Response: 198
Explanation: According to the question, Nel had 566 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, Nel has 535 cards left, which means that Jeff must have received 31 cards from Nel (566 - 535 = 31). Therefore, Jeff has 234 + 31 = 265 cards now."
"Response: 276
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nel had 309 baseball cards initially and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 10-card packs remaining. Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nel has is 276 (309 - 149)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nel had 246 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 non-baseball cards remaining. To find out how many more baseball cards Nel has than 10, we can subtract the number of non-baseball cards from the total number of baseball cards: 404 - 495 = -91. Therefore, Nel has 36 more baseball cards than 10."
"Response: 46
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nel had 573 baseball cards and gave 195 of them to John. This means that she has 210 cards left. To find out how many cards Neel will give to Jeff, we can divide the number of cards she has left (210) by the number of cards she gave to John (195): 210 / 195 = 46. Therefore, Neel will give 46 cards to Jeff."

"Response: 3 times
Explanation: According to the question, the total weight of jarsadi Marcos and his father is 26 pounds, which means that each jaradi weighs 4 kilograms / 0.45 = 8.9 kilograms. Since Marcos's jarsadi weigh 4 kilograms less than his father's, his father's jarsadi must weigh 3 times as much as Marcos's jarsadi. Therefore, the weight of Marcos's jarsadi is 3 times 8.9 kilograms = 26.7 kilograms."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 2 children in the bus, and then 5 more children got on the bus after the stop. Therefore, the total number of children in the bus now is 7 (2 + 5)."
Response: 54 children (26 + 38)
"Response: 30
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Някои деца се качваха в автобуса."" means that some children got into the bus.
* ""На автобусна спирка још двадесети деца се качиха в автобуса."" means that at the bus stop, another 20 children got into the bus.
* ""Тогава в автобуса имаше общо 41 деца."" means that there were altogether 41 children in the bus after the new passengers got on at the bus stop.

Now, let's find out how many children were in the bus before the bus stop:

Total number of children = Number of children who got into the bus + Number of children already in the bus
= 20 + 30 (from the previous question)
= 50

Therefore, there were 50 children in the bus before the bus stop."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children in the bus. After some of them got off at a stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. To find out how many children got off at the stop, we can divide the number of children remaining in the bus by the initial number of children and multiply by the number of children who got off at the stop. In this case, 21 / 43 = 0.5 or 50%. Therefore, 50% of the original number of children, or 7 children, got off at the stop."
"Response: 33
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""В автобуса имаха 41 деца"" means that there were 41 children in the bus initially.
* ""На автобусна спирка някои деца слязоха от автобуса"" means that some children got off the bus at a stop.
* ""Тогава в автобуса останаха 18 деца"" means that after some children got off, there were 18 children left in the bus.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children:

Initial number of children = 41
Final number of children = 18

So, the difference between the two numbers is:

Difference = Initial number - Final number = 41 - 18 = 23

Therefore, the correct answer is 23."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, 10 children got off the bus at the stop, and ""several"" more got on. If there were initially 21 children on the bus, and 10 got off, then there are now 11 children left on the bus (21 - 10 = 11). Therefore, 4 children got on the bus at the stop."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 5 children in the bus, and then 63 children got off the bus. Therefore, the total number of children who got off the bus is 63 - 5 = 58. Since some children also boarded the bus, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 9 (i.e., 58 - 49)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, initially there were 36 children in the bus and 68 got off at the stop. This means that 36 - 68 = -32 children got off the bus. Since some children also boarded the bus, the total number of children on the bus afterward is 12 (the difference between the initial number of children and the number who got off). Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 32 more than the number who boarded the bus."
Response: 18 children got off the bus at the stop.
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 28 children in the bus, and then 82 children got on the bus while 64 children got off the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 82 - 64 = 18. So, 18 more children got on the bus than got off it."

"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, 44 cuvals of mature portulacas and 25 cuvals of immature portulacas are collected per day. Therefore, the number of additional mature portulacas collected per day is:
39 = (44 - 25) / 2
This means that for every 25 cuvals of immature portulacas collected, an additional 14 cuvals of mature portulacas are collected."
"Response: 360
Explanation: According to the passage, 74 cuvals of unripe portulacas are collected per day. If we assume that each cup contains 1/2 kilogram (since there are 200 grams in a cup), then the total weight of unripe portulacas collected per day is:
74 cuvals x 1/2 kg/cuval = 36 kg
Now, let's find out how many more kilograms of ripe portulacas are collected per day than unripe ones:
Total weight of ripe portulacas collected per day = Total weight of unripe portulacas collected per day + Weight of ripe portulacas collected per day
= 36 kg +?
Since the passage states that 5 cuvals of ripe portulacas are collected per day, we can calculate the total weight of ripe portulacas collected per day as follows:
Total weight of ripe portulacas collected per day = 5 cuvals x 1/2 kg/cuval = 2.5 kg
Now, let's subtract the weight of unripe portulacas from the weight of ripe portulacas to get the difference:
Difference = Total weight of ripe portulacas collected per day - Total weight of unripe portulacas collected per day
= 2.5 kg - 36 kg
= -33.5 kg
So, the difference between the weight of ripe and unripe portulacas collected per day is negative 33.5 kilograms."

"Response: 374
Explanation: According to the question, 86 cuvels of mature portokali are collected per day, and 41 cuvels of immature portokali are collected per day. Therefore, the difference in the number of cuvels collected between mature and immature portokali is 86 - 41 = 45 cuvels per day. So, the number of cuvels of mature portokali collected per day is 86 / 2 = 43 cuvels per day."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the question, 71 cuvals of unripe portulaccs and 60 cuvals of ripe portulacs are collected per day. Therefore, the difference in the number of cuvals collected between unripe and ripe portulacs is 71 - 60 = 11 cuvals.

"Response:  $30
Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold 95 teenikes during both matches in Arkansas and Texas. If they sold 47 teeineski during one of the matches (Arkansas), then they sold 48 teeineski during the other match (Texas). Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $87 x 48 = $4160."
"Response: 77

Explanation:
If the store sold $106 from each sold tennis shoe and they sold 242 tennis shoes in total during both matches in Arkansas and Texas, then the total amount of money earned from selling tennis shoes is:

$106 x 242 = $25,932

Since they sold 115 tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas, the number of tennis shoes sold during the match in Texas can be calculated as follows:

Number of tennis shoes sold in Texas = Total number of tennis shoes sold - Number of tennis shoes sold in Arkansas
= 242 - 115
= 127

Therefore, the store sold 127 tennis shoes during the match in Texas."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold 163 tee shirts during both matches in Arkansas and Texas. If they sold 89 tee shirts during the match in Arkansas, then they earned $40 from each tee shirt sale during that match ($98 per tee shirt x 89 tee shirts = $8520)."
"Response:  $30
Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold 186 teenikes during both matches in Arkansas and Texas. If they sold 172 teeineskiis during the match in Arkanas, then they made $30 from each of those sales. Therefore, they made a total of $30 from selling teeineskis during the match in Texas."
"Response:  $405
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the store sold 183 teenies and 31 masks during the match between Arkansas and Texas, which means they earned $183 + $31 = $214 from these sales.

Response: 208 dollars.
"Response: 34

Explanation:
The shop made $192 from each tennis shoe and $34 from each hat. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 157 tennis shoes and 19 hats. Therefore, the price of one tennis shoe is $192 / 157 = $1.20 per shoe, and the price of one hat is $34 / 19 = $1.80 per hat."
"Response:  $10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the price of one teenski is $86 and the price of one mask is $43. Therefore, we can calculate the difference between the two prices as follows: $43 - $86 = -$43. Since this value is negative, it means that one mask costs more than one teenski by $43."
"Response: 2690
Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold 130 teakettles during the match between Arkansas and Texas, and each teakettle was sold for $ 51. Therefore, the total revenue from sales of teakettles is 130 x $ 51 = $ 6,430. Since the store offered an discount of $ 8 per teakettle, it would have earned $ 6,430 - $ 576 = $ 5,854 in profit from selling teakettles."
Response: 358 dollars. Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold each tennis shoe for $201 before the game between Arkansas and Texas. If they increased the price by $217 during the game, then they sold 14 tennis shoes at the higher price, which means they earned an additional amount of money. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling tennis shoes is $201 x 14 = $2840 + ($217 x 14) = $3580.
"Response: 40 pairs of shoes were sold. Explanation: According to the question, ""Бръсначът"" (Bransnat) made $60 from selling tennis shoes during the match between Arkansas and Texas. If they made $10 per pair of shoes sold, then they sold 40 pairs of shoes in total."

Response: 389 dollars. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the store made $5 from each tennis ball and $215 from each basketball game. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 20 tennis balls and 64 masks, which means they earned an additional $1,070 ($20 x 20 + $64). Therefore, the total amount of money the store earned from selling tennis balls is $389 ($5 x 20 + $1,070).
Response: 386 dollars.
"Response:  $58 = (177 x $2) + (23 x $10) - $210 - $240
Explanation: The first part of the equation is the cost of each teenaki ($2), multiplied by the number sold (177). This gives us $354. Then we subtract the total revenue from the match between Arkansas and Texas ($210 + $240 = $450), which leaves us with $94. Finally, we add the cost of one mask ($10), to get the final answer of $58."

"Response: 75 weeks
Explanation: According to the passage, Luis earned $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, it means that the harvest season lasted for 75 weeks (1216 / 16 = 75)."
Response: 3548.92 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the amount of money Luis will have at the end of the season, we need to multiply the weekly income by the number of weeks in the season. Since Luis earns $21 per week and there are 216 weeks in a season, his total income is: $21 x 216 = $4320. Then, if he pays $702 in taxes, his remaining balance is: $4320 - $702 = $3548.92.
"Response:  $406,893

Explanation:
To calculate how much money Luis will earn if he works for 73 seasons, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of seasons he will work. Since he earned $1357 every week, and there are 223 weeks in a season, Luis's total income for one season is:

$1357 x 223 = $ $293,313

If he works for 73 seasons, his total income will be:

$293,313 x 73 = $ $20,553,333

Therefore, Luis will earn approximately $20,553,333 if he works for 73 seasons."
Response: 456 dollars per week during harvest season.  Explanation: According to the question, Luis earns $28 per day during harvest season and works for 109 weeks. Therefore, his total earnings during harvest season are $28 x 109 = $2,872. If he also earns $939 per week working irregularly, then his total weekly earnings during harvest season would be $2,872 + $939 = $3,811.
"Response: 1657 dollars

Explanation:
Let's assume that Luis worked for 233 weeks during his harvest season and earned $403 per week. To calculate how much he earned overall during this period, we can multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks he worked:

$403/week x 233 weeks = $87,910

Now, let's find out how much Luis paid in rent each week. According to the question, he paid $49 per week in rent. To calculate the total amount he paid in rent over the course of his harvest season, we can multiply his weekly rent payment by the number of weeks he worked:

$49/week x 233 weeks = $10,977

So, Luis earned a total of $87,910 during his harvest season and paid $10,977 in rent. Therefore, he had a net income of:

$87,910 - $10,977 = $76,033"
"Response:  $2040
Explanation:
To find out how much Luis will pay in rent during the wheat harvest season of 135 weeks, we need to multiply the weekly rent by the number of weeks. The weekly rent is given as $388, so multiplying it by 135 gives us the total amount that Luis will pay in rent during the season: $2040."
"Response:  $37500

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Luis earned $491 per week during 118 weeks of harvesting.
* He has to pay $216 per week as rent.

So, the total amount of money Luis earned during the season is:
$491 x 118 = $57,688

Now, let's subtract the amount he has to pay as rent:
$57,688 - $216 x 118 = $37,500

Therefore, at the end of the season, Luis will have $37,500 left after paying the rent."
Response:  $133 / 7 = $18.57
"Response: 5 weeks
Explanation: According to the question, Luis earned $2 per week during harvest time. To find out how many weeks he worked, we need to divide the total amount he earned ($178) by his weekly earnings ($2): $178 / $2 = 5 weeks."
"Response: 23 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, after Dean takes a break and decides to dive again, he will be 9 feet deeper in the water than before. Since the depth of the water is 10 times higher than Dean's height, this means that the water is now 10 x 9 = 90 feet deep from Dean's original position. Therefore, the distance from Dean's current position to the bottom of the ocean is 90 - 9 = 81 feet."
Response:  The depth of the water was twice as great as Dean's height, which is 2 meters. Therefore, if Dean is at a depth of 4 meters, the depth of the water must be 8 meters.
Response:  The depth of the water is 60 feet (5 times the height of Ron + 3 meters).
"Response: 270 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, ""Дълбочината на водата е 15 пъти по-голяма от височината на Дийн."" This means that if Dean is 4 feet tall (as stated in the passage), then the depth of the water is 15 times 4 = 60 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to yards by dividing by 12: 60 ft / 12 in/ft = 5 yd. So, the depth of the water was 5 yards or 270 feet."
"Response: 25 feet
Explanation: According to the passage, ""Дълбочината на водата е 16 пъти по-голяма от височината на Рон."" This means that if Ron is at a height of 13 feet, then the depth of the water is 16 x 13 = 208 feet. However, since we are asked for the depth in feet, we convert it to 25 feet by multiplying by 8 (since there are 8 feet in 1 foot). Therefore, the correct answer is 25 feet."
"Response: 27 feet
Explanation:
According to the passage, ""Дълбочината на водата е 9 пъти по-голяма от височината на Дийн."" This means that if Dean is 6 feet tall (which is half of Ron's height), then the depth of the water is 9 times 6 = 54 feet. Since there are 3 feet in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 3: 54 / 3 = 18 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water was 18 feet."

Carol sent invitations for her birthday party to her friends. Each box of invitations contained 10 invitations and she bought 7 boxes. If she sends invitations only to two friends, how many invitations will remain? Therefore, the answer is 35 (2 x 10 - 7)."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Karol sent invitations for his birthday party to his friends and each box of invitations had 14 invitations. Since she bought 6 boxes, that means she sent out a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number of invitations to 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, Karol could have invited up to 95 friends to her birthday party."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Carol sent out invitations for her birthday party and each box of invitations contained three invitations. Since she wants to invite 9 friends in total, she will need to buy 3 additional boxes of invitations (since each box contains 3 invitations). Therefore, the answer is 3."

"Response: 16
Explanation: If Matyu has given an equal number of biscuits and cakes to all his four friends, then he must have given 16 biscuits (half of 32) and 98 cakes (whole number)."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Matyu gave an equal number of biscuits and cakes to all his four friends. If he had initially 10 biscuits and 8 cakes, then each friend got 5 biscuits (since there are 4 friends) and 2 cakes (since there were originally 8 cakes). Therefore, each friend received 5 + 2 = 7 items in total."
"Response: 7
Explanation: Let's assume that Maty had an equal number of biscuits and cakes initially (i.e., 13 biscuits + 15 cakes = x). Since he gave each friend an equal amount (i.e., 28 friends), the total number of biscuits and cakes given away is 2x. Therefore, the initial number of biscuits and cakes must be in the ratio 7:9 (or 4:6) respectively. So, Maty had 7 biscuits and 9 cakes initially."

Explanation:
The question states that Debi bought several bottles of water during a sale and drank 109 bottles per day for 74 days. To find out how many bottles she bought, we need to divide the total number of bottles drunk by the number of days she drank them. In this case, Debi drank 74 x 109 = 8260 bottles over the 74-day period, so she must have bought at least 8260 / 74 = 11 bottles initially. Since Debi did not drink all the bottles in one day, we can assume that she bought an odd number of bottles (e.g., 3, 5, or 7). Therefore, the answer is 356 bottles."
Response: 9.
Response:  Debi has 264 bottles of water and drinks 15 bottles per day for 11 days. Therefore, she has 264 - (15 x 11) = 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left.

Explanation:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x represent the number of packages of DVDs that can be bought with $93.
According to the question, each package costs $107, so the total cost of one package is $107.
We want to find out how many packages can be bought with $93, so we divide $93 by $107:
x = $93 / $107 = 0.85
Since you cannot buy a fraction of a package, we round down to the nearest whole number:
x = 4
Therefore, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs with $93."
"Response:  $34.00
Explanation: To find out how much you will have to pay for each package of DVDs, we need to subtract $25 from the original price of $76. So, if you buy one package of DVDs, you will have to pay $51 ($76 - $25). If you buy five packages of DVDs, you will have to pay $255 ($51 x 5). Therefore, the answer is $34."

"Response: 589
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 132 visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day Raychel visited. If 406 people had visited the palace during the last 327 days, then the number of visitors on the previous day would be 589 (406 x 327)."
"Response: 1376
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, 45 visitors came to Blenheim Palace the day before, and there were 829 visitors during the last 85 days. Therefore, if 829 people visited Blenheim Palace during that time period, then 1376 people must have visited it on the current day (829 + 45 = 1376)."
"Response: 436
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in each of the last 57 days is represented by x. Since there were 71 paintings in the palace during Racheal's visit, and 557 visitors came today, we can write the equation:
x + 71 = 557
Now, let's solve for x using substitution method:
x + 71 = 557
Subtracting 71 from both sides gives us:
x = 436
Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last 57 days is 436."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 39 paintings in the Buckingham Palace collection and 661 visitors came to see them that day. If 600 visitors came to the palace the previous day, then the number of additional visitors to the palace on that day is 661 - 600 = 61."
"Response: 568
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day of the examination. If we add this number to the previous two days' visits (419 + 103 = 522), we get a total of 568 visitors to the palace before the current day."
"Response: 3650
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 512 visitors (obviously more than day 1)
Total number of days = 89 days
So, total number of visitors = Total number of days x Average daily visitors
= 89 x 3650
Therefore, the answer is 3650."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
To find out how many more visitors came to Blenheim Palace today compared to the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (191) from the total number of visitors today (705). Therefore, the difference is:
705 - 191 = 368
So, there were 368 more visitors at Blenheim Palace today than in the previous 245 days."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""В автобуса има 12 души"" means that initially there are 12 people in the bus.
* ""На следващата спирка още четирима се качиха в автобуса"" means that 4 more people get into the bus at the next stop.
* ""В автобуса могат да се качат не повече от 36 души"" means that the maximum number of people who can be accommodated in the bus is 36.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people in the bus after the additional 4 passengers get in:

Initially, there were 12 people in the bus + 4 new passengers = 16 people in the bus (including both initial and new passengers).

So, the final answer is 40 people in the bus (12 initial + 16 new = 40)."
Response: 10 + 12 = 22
