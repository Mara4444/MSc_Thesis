Explanation: According to the question, 15 people can complete their work in parallel. If some of them started working later than others, then they will finish their work at different times. Let's assume that 32 people worked together and finished their tasks in one day. Since some of them started working later than others, it means that they will take less time to finish their tasks compared to those who started working earlier. Therefore, if 32 people worked together and took an average time of X hours to finish their tasks, then the time taken by each person to finish their task is X/32. So, the number of people who finished their tasks in X hours or less is 40 (since there are 32 people and 40 is the nearest integer to X/32)."

Response:  The ratio of high jumps (konn) to low jumps (hiir) is 10:7. Therefore, if konn has 24 hops and hiir has 33 hops, then the difference between their numbers of hops is 9 (33 - 24). If konn's hops are 5 more than rohumaal's hops, then rohumaal has 29 hops (33 - 9 = 29).
Response:  The number of hops for each animal is as follows: Rat - 2 hops, Cat - 4 hops, Dog - 6 hops, and Mouse - 8 hops. Therefore, if a mouse jumps over a cat, it will jump 4 + 2 = 6 hops.

Response:  The ratio of the heights of rats, cats, and mice is 3:4:5. Therefore, if a rat is 25 cm tall, a cat is 3 times as tall as a mouse, so a cat is 70 cm tall (3 x 25 = 75). A mouse is 5 times as tall as a rat, so a mouse is 125 cm tall (5 x 25 = 125).
Response: 40
Response:  The height of the rat is 35 cm, and the height of the hare is 40 cm. Therefore, the ratio of the heights of the rat and hare is 35/40 = 0.875.
Response:  The ratio of the heights of rats, mice, and rabbits is 2:3:4. Therefore, if a rat is 10 cm tall, a mouse is 15 cm tall, and a rabbit is 20 cm tall, then a rat is equivalent in height to 3/4 of a mouse or 1/2 of a rabbit.
Response:  The difference between the number of pieces of bread and the number of pieces of sugar is 9 (14 - 5 = 9). Therefore, you need to add at least 9 more pieces of sugar to have the same amount as the bread.
Response:  The ratio of sugar to flour is 11:9, which means that for every 9 parts of flour, there are 11 parts of sugar. Therefore, if you want to make a dough with a total weight of 40 kg (which is equal to 40 x 10 = 400 tassi), you will need to add at least 265 tassi (or 265/9 = 30 tassi) of sugar in addition to the 9 tassi of flour.

Response:  The difference between the number of tassi suhkrut and the number of tassi jahu is 3 (9 - 6). Therefore, to find out how many more tassi jahu there are than tassi suhkrut, we need to add 3 to the number of tassi suhkrut, which gives us 9 + 3 = 12.

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Dave has 11 devices (rakendust) and 3 files (faili).
* After using some of the devices and files, there were 24 files and 2 devices left.

From this information, we can deduce that Dave had 50 devices (rakendust) initially. This is because he had 11 devices at first, and then used some of them to have 2 devices left. Similarly, he had 3 files initially, which he also used to have 2 files left. Therefore, the total number of devices Dave had initially is 11 + 3 = 14."

Response:  The total cost of five T-shirts is $51. If three T-shirts are purchased from Arkansas and two from Texas Tech, how much does each T-shirt cost?
"Response:  $10236

Explanation:
The total cost of 87 T-shirts for Arkansas and Texas Tech is $95 x 87 = $8295. If Arkansas has 47 T-shirts left after selling them to Texas Tech, then the amount of money they made from selling those shirts is $8295 - $47 = $7818. Therefore, the final answer is $10236 (the difference between the initial cost and the amount made)."
Response:  The difference between the number of razorbacks (T-särkide) in Arkansas and Texas Tech is $106 dollars per head. Arkansas has 242 T-särki while Texas Tech has 115 T-särki. Therefore, there are 127 more T-särki in Arkansas than in Texas Tech ($106 x 127 = $13,028).
"Response:  $204
Explanation:
The total number of razors (T-särkide) in both teams is 163. If Arkansas has 89 razors and Texas Tech has 74 razors, then the difference between the two numbers is 89 - 74 = 15. Therefore, the amount of money that Arkansas spent on razors is $15 x 98 dollars = $1470. Since Texas Tech also had 89 razors, they spent $1470 / 2 = $735 on razors. So, the total amount of money spent by both teams on razors is $1470 + $735 = $2045."
"Response:  $340

Explanation:
The total number of razors (T-särkide) in Arkansas is 78 dollars. The difference between the number of razors in Arkansas and Texas Tech is 186 razors. If Arkansas had 172 razors more than Texas Tech, how much money would they have saved if they bought all those razors at $3 each? Therefore, the answer is $340."
Response:  $450
Response:  $239
Response:  The difference between $192 and $34 is $158. Therefore, if you have more T-shirts than sunglasses, you would make $158 more money selling them.
Response:  The cost of 100 razorback tickets is $86 each, and the cost of 232 parking passes is $23 each. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets and parking would be $86 x 100 = $8,600 + $23 x 232 = $5,096. So, you would pay more for parking than for tickets.
"Response:  $426

Explanation:
The total value of all T-shirts is given as $51 + $8 x 2 = $426."
Response:  $568
Response:  The ratio of the number of dollars spent by Arkansas to the number of dollars spent by Texas Tech is $60 : $10 = 6 : 1. Therefore, for every dollar spent by Arkansas, Texas Tech spends $6.
Response:  The total cost of 5 T-shirts at $215 is 5 x $215 = $1075.
Response:  $3798
Response:  $39,600
Response:  The difference between $210 and $240 is $30. Therefore, if you have $210 in one account and $240 in another account, you have $30 more in the second account than in the first account.
Response:  The number of razorbacks is $115 - $25 = $90 more than the number of T-shirts. Therefore, there are $90 \times 113 = 10,490 more razorbacks than T-shirts.

"Response: 598

Explanation:
The number of people who visited Buckingham Palace last year was 132. If 406 people will visit this year, and there were 327 days between last year's visit and this year's visit, then the average number of visitors per day is:

Average = (Number of visitors / Number of days) = (132 / 327) = 598

Therefore, the answer is 598."

"Response: 363

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace can be calculated as follows:

* On the previous day (day 1), there were 471 visitors.
* On the current day (day 2), there are 512 more visitors than on the previous day, so the total number of visitors is: 471 + 512 = 983.
* Therefore, the number of visitors on day 2 is 983."
"Response: 368

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace can be calculated by subtracting the previous year's number of visitors from the current year's number of visitors. According to the passage, there were 191 visitors in the previous year and 457 visitors in the current year, so the difference between the two years is:

457 - 191 = 266

Therefore, there are 266 more visitors to Buckingham Palace this year than last year."

Response:  If you have taken 57 grams of liquid and added it to 22 grams of solid, then the total weight of the mixture is 353 grams. Therefore, the amount of solid in the mixture is 353 - 22 = 331 grams.
Response:  The difference between the weight of 166 grams and 20 grams is 146 grams.
Response: 203 grams
Response:  The difference between the weight of the original amount (11 grams) and the weight after steeping (492 grami), is equal to 481 grams.
Response:  If 94 contestants can collectively gather 90 bunches of grapes in one day, and each bunch contains 12 grapes, then the total number of grapes collected is: 90 x 12 = 1080 grapes.
Response:  The number of marbles that each player has at the end of the game is equal to the number of days they have been playing. Therefore, if there are 266 players and they play for 90 days, each player will have 266/90 = 3 marbles at the end of the game.
Response:  If each participant has an average of 244 g of wine and 47 g of cheese per person, and there are 294 participants in total, then the total amount of wine consumed is 244 x 294 = 68,536 g. Therefore, if every fourth person takes a sip of wine (i.e., 244/4 = 61 people), then the number of sips taken by all participants is 61 x 68,536 = 409,676 sips.
"Response:  If there are 235 participants and each participant has to collect at least 100 bunches of grapes and 221 bunches of berries, then the total number of bunches collected is:

Total number of bunches = Number of participants x Minimum number of bunches required per participant
= 235 x 100
= 23,500 bunches

Since there are 77 days in the season, the daily average number of bunches collected is:

Daily average number of bunches = Total number of bunches / Number of days in the season
= 23,500 / 77
= 308 bunches per day"
Response:  If there are 252 participants and each participant can collect at most 108 g of wine, then after 57 days, the total amount of collected wine is: 252 x 108 = 26,944 g.
