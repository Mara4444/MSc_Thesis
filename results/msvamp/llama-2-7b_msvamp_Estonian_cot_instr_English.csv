Response:  If Julia has 18 lapses at her disposal for the evening and she wants to distribute them equally among 10 people, each person will get 1.8 lapses (18 / 10 = 1.8). Now let's see how many more or fewer lapses Julia can give if she has more than 10 people. For example, if she has 20 people, each person will get 1.5 lapses (18 / 20 = 1.5), which is less than before. Similarly, if she has 30 people, each person will get 1.2 lapses (18 / 30 = 1.2), which is even fewer than before. Therefore, the answer is that Julia can give more lapses if she has more than 10 people.
Response:  We have 11 lapses in summer and we want to know how many more lapses there are than in winter. So, if we take 12 lapses for winter, then the difference between summer and winter is 11 - 12 = -1 lapse. Therefore, there are one less lapse in winter than in summer.
Response:  If Julia has 15 pieces of candy and she wants to divide them equally among her friends, then each friend will get 15/number_of_friends = 15/4 = 3.75 pieces of candy. So, if there are 4 friends in total, then Julia will have 15 - (3.75 x 4) = 15 - 14.5 = 0.5 pieces of candy left over after dividing them equally among her friends.
Response:  If Julia has 14 pieces of candy and she gives 2 to each of her friends, then she will have 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of candy left.  If she now wants to give 4 more pieces of candy to each friend, then she will have 12 + (4 x 3) = 12 + 12 = 24 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  If Julia has 16 lapses at her disposal and she wants to spend more than 12 of them on the holiday, then for how many lapses will she have left after spending 12 on the holiday? Therefore, if she has X lapses left after spending 12 on the holiday, then she can spend Y = X - 12 lapses on the holiday.
Response:  If Julia has 14 lapses in total and she wants to give more than half of them to her daughter, then we need to find out how many lapses are left for Julia after giving half to her daughter.  Half of 14 is 7, so Julia has 7 lapses left after giving half to her daughter. Now, if Julia gives 3 lapses to her daughter, then Julia has 4 lapses left (7 - 3 = 4). So, Julia gives 4 lapses to her daughter.
Response:  Julia has 17 days off in total, and she works for 30 weeks (15 weeks of summer vacation + 15 weeks of winter vacation). So, we can calculate her working hours as follows: Working hours = Total workdays / Number of weeks worked = 17 days x 4 weeks/day = 68 hours per week. Therefore, Julia works 68 hours per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 15 lapses at esmaspäeval, and she has 18 lapses at teisipäeval. So, the total number of lapses Julia has is: 15 + 18 = 33 lapses. Now, let's find out how many lapses Julia has at colmapäeval. We are given that Julia has 97 lapses at colmapäeval. Therefore, the total number of lapses Julia has is: 33 + 97 = 129 lapses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 5 lapses at Esmapevaal (Esmaspäeval), and she has 9 lapses at Teispäeval (Teisipäeval). So, the total number of lapses Julia has is: 5 + 9 = 14 lapses. Therefore, Julia has 14 lapses in total.
"Response:  The first clue is ""Julia mängis esmaspäeval kahe lapsega"". This means that Julia has two pairs of shoes. So far so good! Now we have to find out how many shoes Julia has in total. We know from the next sentence that there are 14 and 16 shoes in the second pair. Therefore, Julia has 2 x 14 = 28 shoes in total."
Response:  We know that Julia has 9 lapses at Esmapevaal, 7 at Teispäval and 96 at Kolmapäval. So, we need to find out how many more lapses Julia has at Esmapevaal than she does at Teispäval. To do this, we can subtract the number of lapses at Teispäval from the number of lapses at Esmapevaal:  Number of extra lapses = Number of lapses at Esmapevaal - Number of lapses at Teispäval  In this case, the number of extra lapses is:  Number of extra lapses = 9 - 7 = 2 Therefore, Julia has 2 more lapses at Esmapevaal than she does at Teispäval.
Response:  We know that Julia has 14 lapses at Esma's birthday party and 2 lapses at Teisi's birthday party. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many lapses Julia had at Kolma's birthday party. According to the question, Julia had 8 lapses at Kolma's birthday party. Therefore, the final answer is: Julia had more lapses at Esma's birthday party than she did at Kolma's birthday party.
Response:  Julia has 6 children, and their ages are as follows: 11 years old, 9 years old, 7 years old, 5 years old, 3 years old, and 1 year old. So, among these six children, the one who is older than all the others is the 11-year-old child. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the 11-year-old child is older than all the other five children combined.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia has 15 lapses at esmaspäeval, and she has 18 lapses at teisipäeval. So, the total number of lapses Julia has is: 15 + 18 = 33. Now, let's find out how many lapses Julia has at colmapäeval. We are given that Julia has 7 last (or ""last"" means ""left""). So, the number of lapses Julia has at colmapäeval is: 7. Therefore, the final answer to the question is: 33 + 7 = 40."
Response:  Firstly, Julia has 13 lapses in her first day and 10 lapses in her second day, so she has a total of 23 lapses. Thirdly, if Julia takes three days off work, then she will have 23 + 15 = 38 lapses. Therefore, Julia has 38 lapses.
Response:  We know that Julia has 7 balls in her bag for the evening and 13 balls for the weekend. If she wants to have at least 20 balls in her bag for the whole month, then we need to find out how many days are left after subtracting the number of days she already has balls (7 + 13 = 20). So, there are 20 - 7 = 13 days left in the month. Therefore, Julia needs to buy 13 more balls to reach her target of having at least 20 balls in her bag for the whole month.
Response:  We know that Julia has 12 lapses in her esmaspäeval and 14 lapses in her teisipäeval. So, we can calculate the total number of lapses as follows: Total lapses = Esmaspäeval + Teisipäeval - Last lapse in esmaspäeval = 12 + 14 - 3 = 27 lapses Therefore, Julia has 27 lapses in total.
Response:  The number of apples Julia has at the end of summer is 19 lapses. At the beginning of winter, she has 18 bags of apples. If she sells each bag for 38 rubles, how many rubles will she earn in total? To find out, we need to subtract the number of bags she had at the beginning of winter from the number of bags she had at the end of summer and divide it by the price per bag. So, if she sold all her apples at once, she would have earned 38 x (19 - 18) = 380 rubles. But since she doesn't sell them all at once, let's assume that she sells half of them during winter and the other half during spring. Therefore, she will have 9 bags left after winter and 9 + 9 = 18 bags left after spring. So, she will have earned 38 x (18 - 12) = 456 rubles in total.
Response:  We have $10$ lapses at teisipäev and $20$ lapses at esmaspäev. So, we can calculate the difference between them as follows : $\text {Difference} = \text{Esmaspäeval Lapsega } - \text{Teisipäeval Lapsega}$  Therefore, the number of extra lapses at esmaspäev is : $\text {Extra Lapses} = \text{Esmaspäeval Lapsega } - \text{Teisipäeval Lapsega}$  Now let's convert this value to a numerical answer : $\boxed{\text{Extra Lapses} = 10 - 5 = 5}}$  So, there are $5$ more lapses at esmaspäev than at teisipäev.
"Response: 
Julia has 18 marbles in total. On the first day (esmaspäev), she gives 4 marbles to her friend. So, Julia now has 18 - 4 = 14 marbles left. 
On the second day (teisipäev), Julia receives 3 more marbles from her friend. So, Julia now has 14 + 3 = 17 marbles. Therefore, Julia had 17 marbles at the end of the second day."
Response:  If Julia has 4 bags of apples and she gives 2 bags to her friend, then Julia has 4 - 2 = 2 bags left.  Now, if Julia has 6 bags of apples for the next day (esmaspäeval), that means she got additional 6 - 2 = 4 bags of apples.  And finally, if Julia has 17 bags of apples for the third day (teisipäeval), that means she got additional 17 - 4 = 13 bags of apples. So, the answer is 13.
Response:  If Bobby has sold 25 bundles of commodities and he has 43 commodities left, then we can calculate how many bundles he had initially as follows:  Number of bundles = Total number of commodities / Number of bundles per bundle = 43 / 25 = 1.73 bundles Initially, Bobby had 1.73 bundles of commodities.
Response:  Bobby has 28 commi and he wants to know how many more he needs to have 42 tukki. So, we can start with the calculation:  Number of commi needed = Total number of tukki / Number of commi  Number of commi needed = 42 / 28 = 1.5  Therefore, Bobby needs 1.5 more commi to have 42 tukki. Now, let's calculate how many commi Bobby already has:  Number of commi already = Total number of tukki / Number of commi  Number of commi already = 63 / 28 = 2.27  So, Bobby already has 2.27 commi. To find out the exact number of commi Bobby needs, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number:  Exact number of commi needed = Rounded value of previous result  Exact number of commi needed = 2.27 rounded to nearest whole number = 2  There you go! Bobby needs 2 more commi to have 42 tukki.
Response:  Bobby has 33 commi and he wants to share them equally among 5 people. So each person will get 6 commi (33/5). Now, let's calculate how many chocolates each person will get. If there are 14 chocolates in total, then each person will get 2 chocolates (14/5). Therefore, Bobby will have 6 + 2 = 8 chocolates left after sharing with others.
Response:  Bobby has 38 commi and he wants to share them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of commi. Since there are 36 tukkis in one commi, Bobby will have 36 x 38 = 1472 tukkis if he shares them equally among his friends. Now, Bobby has 16 tukkis left after sharing them with his friends, which means he has 1472 - 16 = 1456 tukkis more than his friends. Therefore, the amount of chocolate that Bobby has is 1456 tukkis.
Response:  Bobby has 20 commas and gives 34 to Sven. So, Sven now has 54 commas (34 + 20). To find out how many commas Bobby has left, we need to subtract the number of commas Sven got from Bobby's original amount: 54 - 20 = 34. Therefore, Bobby has 34 commas left.
Response:  If Bobby has 21 commies and he wants to give each of them 5 things, then he will have 21 x 5 = 105 things in total. So, there are 105 things that Bobby has given away.
Response:  If Bobby has 22 commies and he gives some of them to his friends, then he will have fewer commies left.  Let's assume that he gave away 5 commies. So, now he has 17 commies left.  If there are 8 more commies in total, then the number of commies after Bobby gives them away is: 17 + 8 = 25 commies. Therefore, Bobby has 25 commies left after giving some away.
"Response:  If Bobby has 19 commis and he gives two to his friend, then he has 17 commis left. Now, if we multiply 17 with everything that is in the world (which is not possible), we will get an enormous number. So, the correct answer is ""Everything in the world""."
Response:  If Bobby has taken 32 commies and there are 20 left, then Bobby must have taken 12 commies. So, Bobby took 12 commies.
Response:  If Bobby has 17 commies and he gave 15 of them to Tall, then we have:  Number of commies that Tal has = Total number of commies - Number of commies given to Tal = 36 - 15 = 21. Therefore, Tal has 21 commies.
Response:  If Bobby has 23 commies and he started with 30, then he had 6 commies more at first (30 - 23 = 7). So, now he has 7 + 23 = 30 commies in total.
Response:  We know that Alan has 5 hours and Jake has 3 hours in the park. So, we can start by finding out how much time they have together in the park. To do this, we need to subtract Jake's time from Alan's time: 5 - 3 = 2 hours. Therefore, Alan had more time than Jake in the park.
Response:  If Allan has 2 hours of park time and Jake has 3 hours of park time, then we can say that Jake has $ \frac{3}{2} $ times as much park time as Allan. So if Allan had $\boxed{x}$ hours of park time, Jake would have $\boxed{\frac{3x}{2}}$ hours of park time. Now we are given that Jake has more than twice as much park time as Allan, so we can write an inequality: $\boxed{\frac{3x}{2}} > 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x > \frac{6}{3}$, or $x > 2$. Therefore, Allan has less than $2$ hours of park time.
Response:  If Allan has 2 hours and Jake has x hours in the park, then we can write an equation as follows: 2 = x + x (since Jake also has x hours in the park). Solving for x, we get: x = 4 (since 2 + 2 = 4). Therefore, Jake has 4 hours in the park.
Response:  If Jake has 6 hours of park time and he wants to have more than Allan who has 4 hours, then we can say that Allan has x hours of park time. Since Jake wants to have more than Allan, we know that Jake's park time is greater than or equal to x. Therefore, we can write an inequality equation as follows: 6 ≤ x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 6, which gives us x = 4. So, Allan has 4 hours of park time.
Response:  If Allan has 5 hours of park time and Jake has 6 hours more than Allan, then Jake has 11 hours (6 - 5) of park time.
Response:  We know that Alan bought two cars and Jake bought five cars. So, the total number of cars owned by Alan is 2 + 2 = 4 cars. Now, we need to find out how many cars Jake owns. Since Jake bought five cars, he has 5 - 2 = 3 cars. Therefore, the difference in the number of cars between Alan and Jake is 4 - 3 = 1 car.
Response:  We know that Allan has bought 3 more park passes than Jake. So, if Jake had x park passes, then Allan had 3x park passes. Now we are given that Allan has 5 park passes more than Jake. Therefore, Jake had 5 + 3 = 8 park passes. So, Allan had 3x = 21 park passes.
Response:  If Allan bought three more cars than Jake has, and Jake had six cars initially, then we can say that Allan has x cars where x is equal to 3 + 6 = 9. So, if Jake had 6 cars initially, then Allan would have 9 - 6 = 3 cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 4 hours of park time and Allan has 5 hours of park time. So, if Allan buys more than one hour of park time, he will have more than 5 hours in total. Therefore, the number of hours Allan has in his park is greater than or equal to 6 (5 + x), where x is the number of additional hours he bought. Now, we are given that Allan spent too much money, so we can say that the cost of each hour of park time is greater than $10. Substituting this value into our equation, we get: 6x > 10(5) = 50 6x > 50 So, x > 8. Therefore, Allan has at least 8 hours of park time.
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 hours of work and Jake has 2 hours of work in the park. If Jake bought more than one hour of work from Allan, then we can say that Jake paid for x hours of work. Since Jake had 2 hours of work to begin with, he must have paid for at least 3 hours of work (since he already had 2 hours). So, the number of hours of work that Allan had left after selling to Jake is: 6 - 3 = 3 hours.
Response:  If Jake bought 4 more hours of park time than Allan, and Allan had 6 hours of park time, then Jake had 10 hours of park time (6 + 4 = 10). So, the difference between the number of hours of park time that Jake had and Allan had is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response: 
Alan has 5 hours of work and Jake has 6 hours of work in the park. If Jake buys 3 more hours of work in the park, then he will have 9 hours of work in the park (6 + 3 = 9). So, Jake's share of the park is 9/12 = 3/4."
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 hours and 20 minutes, so he has used 3 + 20 = 23 minutes of his time. Now we need to find out how much time Jake has used. According to the question, Jake has 5 hours and 59 minutes, which means he has used 5 + 59 = 64 minutes of his time. So, the difference in time between Allan and Jake is 64 - 23 = 41 minutes.
"Response:  We know that Allan has 7 hours and 5 minutes of work experience, and Jake has 6 hours and 4 minutes of work experience in the park. So, we can write this as:
Allan - 7 + 5 = x (where x is the total number of hours worked)
Jake - 6 + 4 = y (where y is the total number of hours worked)
Now, we need to find out how many hours they have worked together. To do this, we simply add up their individual hours:
x + y = Total hours worked together
So, substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x + y = 7 + 6 = 13
Therefore, Allan and Jake worked together for 13 hours in the park."
Response:  If Alan can walk for 5 hours and he walks with Jake for 6 hours, then Jake walked for how many hours? So, Jake walked for 1 hour more than Alan.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 2 cars and sells one more car to get 3 cars. So, initially, Allan had 2 x 1 = 2 cars. Now, Jake buys 6 cars from Allan, so Jake gets 6 - 2 = 4 more cars than Allan had. Therefore, the difference between the number of cars owned by Allan and Jake is 4.
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 6 hours and Finnish for 2 hours every day, then in one week he will have studied English for 42 hours (6 x 7) and Finnish for 14 hours (2 x 7). So, Ryan has studied English for more than twice as many hours as Finnish. Therefore, the ratio of hours spent studying English to hours spent studying Finnish is greater than 2:1 or 2.5:1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan can speak English for 6 hours and Russian for 7 hours. So, in total, Ryan has spent 6 + 7 = 13 hours learning languages. Now, let's compare how much time Ryan has spent learning each language. Ryan has spent 6/13 = 0.46 hours learning English and 7/13 = 0.54 hours learning Russian. Therefore, Ryan has spent more time learning Russian than English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 days studying English and 2 days studying Finnish every week, then he will spend a total of 5 days (3 + 2) studying languages per week. Therefore, if he studies for 4 weeks, he will study languages for a total of 20 days (5 x 4).
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 days studying English and more than 5 days studying other languages, then how many days does he spend studying Japanese?
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying English and 30 minutes studying Finnish every day, then he will spend in total 5 x 24 = 120 minutes studying English per day. Therefore, if he studies English for 2 times more than Finnish, that means he will study English for (120 min/day) / (60 min/hour) = 2 hours per day. So, Ryan studies English for 2 hours more than Finnish.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 days studying English and 7 days studying Finnish, then he has studied for a total of 13 days (6 + 7 = 13). So if he studies for 5 days more, that means he will have studied for a total of 18 days (13 + 5 = 18).
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 days studying English and 5 days studying Finnish, then he spends in total 11 days (6 + 5) studying languages. So if he spends more time studying English than any other language, that means he spends approximately 5.45 days (11 / 2) studying English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 days studying English and 4 days studying Finnish, then he has studied for a total of 9 days (5 + 4 = 9). Therefore, if he studies for 6 days, he will have studied for a total of 15 days (6 + 9 = 15).
Response:  If Ryan studied English for 4 days and Finnish for 6 days, then he studied English for 1/3 of the total time (4/3 = 2/3) and Finnish for 1/2 of the total time (6/3 = 2/3). So if Ryan studied for 86 days in total, then he studied English for 2/3 \* 86 = 57 days and Finnish for 2/3 \* 86 = 59 days. Therefore, Ryan studied English for approximately 57 days and Finnish for approximately 59 days.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan studied English for 6 hours, German for 7 hours and Spanish for 3 hours. So in total, he studied these languages for 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours. Therefore, Ryan studied more English than any other language.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan studied English for 6 days, which is equal to 0.17 (6/36) years. Secondly, he studied Spanish for 58 days, which is equal to 0.17 (58/36) years as well. Finally, we can see that Ryan studied more hours of English than Spanish, so let's say he studied 2 times more English than Spanish. Therefore, if Ryan studied 3 times more English than Spanish, then he studied 6 x 3 = 18 times more English than Spanish. So, Ryan studied approximately 18 times more English than Spanish.
Response:  If Ryan studied English for 7 hours and Spanish for 4 hours per day, then he studied English for a total of 14 days (7 x 2) and Spanish for a total of 16 days (4 x 4). So, Ryan studied English for more than twice as many days as he studied Spanish. Therefore, the ratio of time spent studying English to time spent studying Spanish is greater than 2:1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan studied English for 5 days and Spanish for 4 days. So, in total, he studied languages for 9 days (5 + 4). Now, let's compare how many days he studied each language. Ryan studied English for 5 days more than he studied Spanish. Therefore, the ratio of the number of days Ryan studied English to the number of days he studied Spanish is 5 : 4 or 5/4.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and German every day, and he studies 2 hours of English and 1 hour of German per day, how much time does he spend studying each language in total?
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 days studying English and Finnish languages, he will spend 4 days studying English language and 5 days studying Finnish language. So, in total, Ryan spent 19 days (4 + 5) studying both languages.
Response:  On the first day (esmapaeval), there were 8 bags of potatoes. If we subtract 7 bags from that amount, then on the second day (jargmisel paevale), there were 1 bag less than on the first day. So, the difference between the two days is 1 bag.
Response:  On the first day (esmaspäeval), there were 7 bags of potatoes. If we add 12 more bags every day after that (järgmisel päeval), then how many bags will there be on the third day (kett)?  Therefore, the answer is: 3 x 12 = 36 bags of potatoes.
Response:  If there were initially 4 houses (koti) and after 3 days, 2 more houses were built, then the total number of houses is now 6. So, in the next 3 days, each house can have at most 2 additional rooms (purgid), which means that the total number of rooms in all 6 houses is now 12 + 2 = 14 rooms.
Response:  On one day, there were 10 bags of potatoes. If Tal had 8 bags that day, then how many bags did he have in total? So, the answer is 8 + 10 = 18 bags of potatoes.
Response:  On Thursday (esmapaeval), there were 10 cats in total.  From Friday to Sunday (päeval), 3 more cats appeared and 7 more cats disappeared. So, let's calculate how many cats are left now: Total number of cats = Number of cats on Thursday + Number of cats that appeared from Friday to Sunday - Number of cats that disappeared from Friday to Sunday Total number of cats = 10 + 3 + (-7) = 6 Therefore, there are 6 cats left now.
Response:  On the day of Easter (April 23), there were 8 eggs left. If we take away 10 eggs from that amount and add 4 eggs to it, then how many eggs will be left after Easter? So, the answer is 6 eggs.
Response:  On one day, there were 3 bags of potatoes and 21 bags of carrots. The next day, there were 7 bags of potatoes and 44 bags of carrots. To find out how many bags of each vegetable there are in total, we need to add the number of bags from both days together. So, the total number of bags of potatoes is 3 + 7 = 10, and the total number of bags of carrots is 21 + 44 = 65. Therefore, the total number of kilograms of potatoes is 10 x 50 = 500 kg, and the total number of kilograms of carrots is 65 x 10 = 650 kg.
Response:  We have 17 apples and 16 pears. If we have more apples than pears, then...
Response:  If there are 5 apples and 11 pears, then altogether we have 5 + 11 = 16 fruits. Now, if more pears were added to this amount, let's say 10 more, then we would have 16 + 10 = 26 fruits in total. So, yes, if more pears were added than apples, the total number of fruits would be greater.
Response:  If there are 10 big and many small apples in the basket, and there are 15 apples in total, then we can say that the number of big apples is equal to half of the total number of apples minus the number of small apples. So, the number of big apples is:  Half of 15 - 10 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 big apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 more apples than oranges in the basket. So, if there are x orange slices in the basket, then there are x + 10 apple slices in the basket. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 10 = 10x. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, there are 5 orange slices and 5 + 10 = 15 apple slices in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 punasts (punast = 7), 15 kollasts (kollast = 15), and 8 rohelists (rohelist = 8). Now we need to find out how many persikuts (persikut =?) Korvis has. To do this, we can use the information given in the question. For each of the three groups mentioned, we have a certain number of items. If we divide the total number of items by the number of groups, we get the average number of items per group. In this case, the total number of items is 7 + 15 + 8 = 30. So, the average number of items per group is 30 / 3 = 10. Therefore, Korvis has 10 persikuts.
Response:  If there are 7 pumpkins, and each pumpkin has 71 seeds, then the total number of seeds is 7 x 71 = 497 seeds. Now, if we take away 8 rotten seeds from this amount, then the remaining number of good seeds is 497 - 8 = 489 seeds. So, more than half (50%) of the seeds are rotten.
Response:  We have 2 pumpkins (korvis), which contain 6 apples and 14 walnuts. If we take away some of the apples from one of the pumpkins, how many will be left? So, if we take away 3 apples from the first pumpkin, there will be 6 - 3 = 3 apples left. And if we take away 2 apples from the second pumpkin, there will be 6 - 2 = 4 apples left. Therefore, the number of apples that are left after taking them away is 3 + 4 = 7 apples.
Response:  We have 19 pumpkins (Korvis), 11 collard greens (Kollast), and 12 root vegetables (Rohelist). To find out how many more pumpkins there are than collared greens, we need to subtract the number of collard greens from the total number of pumpkins. So, the answer is: More pumpkins than collard greens = 19 - 11 = 8.
Response:  We know that there are 6 purple stars, 90 small stars and 16 round ones. So, if we have many purple stars and round ones, how many will we have in total?
Response:  We have 18 purple flowers, 14 yellow ones and 17 red ones. If we take away as many purple flowers from the total number of flowers as there are yellow ones (14), then we will be left with 18 - 14 = 4 purple flowers. Similarly, if we take away as many yellow flowers from the remaining purple flowers as there are red ones (17), then we will be left with 4 - 17 = -13 purple flowers. So, the final answer is -13.
Response:  We have 5 pumpkins (korvis), and each pumpkin has 14 seeds (kollaste). So we have in total 70 seeds from pumpkins (5 x 14 = 70). Now let's count how many rohels (roots) are there. There are 6 roots in total. Therefore, if we divide the number of seeds by the number of roots, we get 70 / 6 = 11.67. So approximately there are 12 seeds per root.
Response:  We have 7 red apples and 3 green apples in total. Each apple is divided into 4 equal parts (pärsikukorvi). So, we can calculate the number of apples per part as follows: Number of apples = Total number of apples / Number of parts = 7 + 3 = 10 / 4 = 2.5 apples per part. Therefore, there are approximately 2.5 apples in each part or 25 apples in total.
Response:  We have 11 ears of corn and 10 red apples. If we divide the number of apples by the number of ears of corn, we get 18 oranges per ear of corn. So there are 11 x 18 = 198 oranges in total.
Response:  We have 6 parsikukors (small coriander seeds) and each one has 4 grains inside. So we have a total of 24 grains of small coriander seeds. Now let's count the large coriander seeds. There are 16 large coriander seeds and each one has 4 grains inside too. Therefore, there are a total of 64 grains of coriander seeds in all.
Response:  We have 7 carrots and 10 apples. If we take away 2 of the apples, how many will be left? So, there are 8 apples left.
Response:  We have 4 red apples and 3 green apples in one basket. If each basket has 7 apples, then how many baskets do we need to collect 7 apples?  Therefore, there are 28 apples (4 x 7 = 28).
Response:  We have two parsnips and four red apples in one of the bowls. If each bowl has 12 carrots, then how many red apples are in the other bowl?
Response:  If there are 16 verses and each verse has 4 lines (8 words), then the total number of words in all 16 verses is 16 x 4 = 64. Now, if there are 13 purple lines and 5 more red lines than blue lines, then the ratio of red to blue lines is 5:1 or 5/1 = 5. So, for every 5 blue lines, there will be 1 red line. Therefore, the number of red lines is 64 / 5 = 12.8. Since we can't have a fractional line, the nearest integer is 13. So, there are 13 red lines in total.
Response:  We have 19 green apples and 4 red apples in total. If there are 15 apple cores per bunch, then how many bunches of apples do we have? So, if there are many bunches of apples, then how much is the total number of apples?
Response:  We know that there are 10 verses and each verse has 4 pairs of eyes. So, in total, we have 4 x 10 = 40 eyes. Now, we also know that every eye has 6 pupils, so the total number of pupils is 40 x 6 = 240 pupils. Therefore, the number of persimmons is 240 - 6 = 234 persimmons.
Response:  We have 6 red apples (rohelist), 60 small apples (kollast), and 2 big apples (punast). If we combine all these apples together, how many will be in total? So, the answer is: Total number of apples = Number of red apples + Number of small apples + Number of big apples = 6 + 60 + 2 = 78 apples. Therefore, there are more red apples than big apples.
Response:  If there are 8 figures in total and each figure has 4 digits, then we have:  Total number of digits = Number of figures x Number of digits per figure  Therefore, the total number of digits is:  Total number of digits = 8 x 4 = 32 digits.
Response:  If there are 7 figurines in total and Jerry has already collected 3 of them, then there are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining figurines that Jerry hasn't collected yet.  If there are 10 questions in total, then the number of questions about uncollected figurines is 4 / 2 = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that there are 7 figurines in total (4 + 3). If we add 6 more figurines, then the total number of figurines will be 13 (7 + 6). Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We have 5 figurines and 9 books. If we add more figurines (7), then the total number of items is: 5 + 9 + 7 = 21. Therefore, there are more action figures than books.
Response:  If there are two figurines in each box and there are four boxes, then there will be eight figurines in total (2 x 4 = 8). However, if we add more boxes, the number of figurines will increase accordingly. For example, if we have five boxes, then there will be twenty-five figurines in total (5 x 2 = 10 + 10 = 20). Therefore, as the number of boxes increases, so does the number of figurines.
Response:  We know that there are 8 small figures and 9 large figures in total. If we add another 10 large figures, then the total number of large figures will be 19 (9 + 10). So, the total number of raamatut is 19.
Response:  If Jerry has two sets of cards with six cards each and he wants to give more than four pairs of cards, then we need to find out how many pairs of cards Jerry can make if he gives away all his cards.  So, let's calculate it!  Number of pairs of cards = Total number of cards / Number of cards in a pair = (2 x 6) + (4 x 6) = 18 pairs of cards.
Response:  If Jerry has 2 books and he wants to give one of them as a gift to his friend, then he will have 3 books left for himself (1 book + 1 book = 3 books). Now if he gets 5 more books as gifts from other people, he will have 8 books in total (3 books + 5 books = 8 books). So, the number of books that Jerry has after receiving 5 more books is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 8 figures in total and we want to find out how many of them are smiling. So, let's count the number of smiling faces:  There is one smiling face in the first row (the top left figure), none in the second row, two in the third row, three in the fourth row, and four in the fifth row. Therefore, there are 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 smiling faces out of 8 total figures.
Response:  If there are 6 tegels (or pieces) in total and we want to know how many of them can be removed without leaving any trace, then we need to find out how many tegels Jerry has left after removing one from each of the three figures. So, let's calculate that first.  From the question, we know that Jerry has 3 figures with 2 tegels each, for a total of 6 tegels. Now, if he removes one tegel from each figure, he will have 3 figures with 1 tegel each, and 3 tegels remaining. Therefore, the number of tegels Jerry can remove without leaving any trace is 3.
Response:  If we have 8 sets of questions and each set contains 5 questions, then the total number of questions is: 8 x 5 = 40.
Response:  If there are 10 figures in total and each figure has two arms, then we have 2 x 10 = 20 arms in total. Since each arm can be either left or right, we have 20 / 2 = 10 pairs of arms. Therefore, the number of pairs of arms is 10.
"Response:  If there are 7 figurines in total and each box contains 4 figurines, then we have:

Number of boxes = Total number of figurines / Number of figurines per box
= 7 / 4
= 1.75
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, let's round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of boxes = 2
Now, let's calculate the number of action figures inside each box:
If there are 2 boxes, and each box contains 4 action figures, then we have:

Total number of action figures = Number of boxes x Number of action figures per box
= 2 x 4
= 8
So, there are 8 action figures in total."
Response:  We have four stories and four characters in total. If we add two more characters, then there will be six characters in total. So, if we compare the number of actions between these six characters and the four original ones, it is clear that there are more actions involving the additional two characters than with the original four. Therefore, the answer is 6 (the number of additional characters) - 4 (the number of original characters).
Response:  If we have 4 themes and each theme has 3 subtopics, then we have a total of 12 topics.  If we add another 2 subtopics for each topic, then we have a total of 24 subtopics. Therefore, if there are more than 12 raamatud (themes) in the collection, then there must be at least 24 subtopics related to those themes.
Response:  If there are 6 people in one room and each person can accommodate 2 beds, then how many beds will be needed for all 6 people to sleep comfortably? Therefore, if 10 more people come to the same room, how many additional beds will be needed to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep?
Response:  If there were initially 5 birds in the forest and each bird laid an average of 3 eggs per year, then after one year, there would be 15 birds (5 x 3 = 15) in the forest. So, if now there are already 10 birds sitting on their eggs (10/15), that means that 5 birds have hatched from their eggs during this time (10 - 5 = 5). Therefore, the number of birds that have hatched from their eggs is equal to 5.
Response:  We have 4 apples and 46 cherries in total. If we divide the number of cherries by the number of apples, we get 11 (46/4). So there are 11 times more cherries than apples.
Response:  We have 3 lindu (lines) and 2 torki (columns). Each line has 5 dots, so there are 15 dots in total. Since each column can hold at most 4 dots, we can fit only 3 columns of dots. Therefore, the maximum number of dots that can be placed is 3 x 4 = 12 dots.
Response:  We have 3 apples and 4 pears in total. If we add more apples to this amount, let's say 2 more apples, then we will have 5 apples in total (3 + 2 = 5). Now, if we compare the number of pears with the number of apples, we can see that there are still 4 pears even after adding 2 more apples. Therefore, the correct answer is A - 4 pears.
Response:  We have 2 liters of juice and we want to fill 6 glasses with it. Each glass holds 0.5 liters. So, if we divide the total amount of juice (2 liters) by the number of glasses (6), we get: 2 / 6 = 0.33 liters per glass. Therefore, if we fill more than 0.33 liters in each glass, there will be some left over.
Response:  We have 4 apples and 6 cherries in total. If we divide them equally among two people, each person will get 2 apples and 3 cherries. So, there are 2 more cherries than apples.
Response:  We have 3 apples and 4 pears in total. If we divide them equally among 6 people, each person will get 0.5 apples and 0.7 pears (since there are 6 / 2 = 3 people who don't eat any fruit). So, if Palju eats all of his fruits, he will have 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 apples + 4 x 0.7 = 2.8 pears. Therefore, Palju has a total of 1.5 + 2.8 = 4.3 fruits.
Response:  We have 6 apples and 3 cherries in total. If we give one apple to each of two children, then there will be 5 apples left for us (6 - 2 x 1 = 5). So, if more than 5 oranges are given away, there won't be enough fruit left for us. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 oranges (5 - 1 = 4).
Response:  We have 4 apples and 3 cherries in total. If we divide them equally among 6 people, each person will get 2/3 of an apple and 1/3 of a cherry. So, if there are more than 6 people, they will not receive any additional fruit. Therefore, the number of oranges that Linde has is equal to the number of people who do not receive any fruit. Since there are 8 people in total, Linde has 8 - 6 = 2 oranges.
Response:  We have 5 trees (linde) in total. Each tree has 4 branches (varlast). So, we can count how many branches there are in total: 5 trees x 4 branches/tree = 20 branches. Therefore, there are 20 branches in total.
"Response:  We have 4 lines of text and each line has 5 words. So we have total 20 words in the given passage. Now let's count how many times each word appears in the passage:
1. Kaks - Appears once
2. lindu - Appears twice
3. istusid - Appears once
4. aia - Appears once
5. peal - Appears once
6. viis - Appears once
7. lindu - Appears once
8. ja - Appears once
9. neli - Appears once
10. varblast - Appears once
11. tulid - Appears once
12. neile - Appears once
13. juurde - Appears once
Now let's calculate the ratio of each word to the total number of words in the passage:
Kaks / 20 = 0.1 (or 10%)
 Lindu / 20 = 0.2 (or 20%)
 Istusid / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Aia / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Peal / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Viis / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Lindu / 20 = 0.1 (or 10%)
 Ja / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Neli / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Varblast / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Tulid / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Neile / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
 Juurde / 20 = 0.05 (or 5%)
So, based on the above calculation, the most common word in the passage is ""kaks"" which appears 10% of the time, followed by ""lindu"" which appears 20% of the time."
Response:  We have 3 liters of water in the bucket and we want to know how much more water can fit inside it if we fill it up to the top. So, let's calculate the volume of the bucket as follows: Volume of the bucket = Height x Width x Depth (of the bucket) = 10 cm x 50 cm x 40 cm = 2000 cubic centimeters or 2 liters. Now, we are left with 1 liter of free space in the bucket after filling it up to the top. Therefore, we can fit an additional 1 + 1 = 2 liters of water in the bucket beyond what is already there. So, the answer to the question is 2 liters.
Response:  We have 5 torki (tors) and 3 lindu (lind). So we can make 15 pairs of torki and lindu. If we add more than 5 torki to the pile, there will be more than 5 pairs of torki and lindu. Therefore, if we have more than 5 torki, there are more than 15 pairs of torki and lindu.
Response:  We have 6 torki (tors) and 2 lindu (lind). If we add up all these numbers, we get 8. So there are more than 8 torques for each linear meter of the cable.
Response:  We have 6 storks and 2 swallows in total. If we add more storks to the group, how many will be left for the swallows? So, if there are more than 10 storks, then the swallows won't get enough food. Therefore, the correct answer is 10 or less storks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first peak has 48 units of length and the second peak has 11 units of length. Now, let's find out how many times the first peak can be divided into the second peak. We divide 48 by 11 to get 4. So, the first peak is 4 times longer than the second peak. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the second peak is higher than the first one (by 43 units). So, if the height of the first peak is x, then the height of the second peak is x + 43. Now, we are asked to find out how many more units the second peak is high than the first one. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 43 = y, where y is the height of the second peak in units. Solving for y, we get: y = x + 43. Substituting x = 37 (the height of the first peak), we get: y = 37 + 43 = 79. Therefore, the second peak is 79 units higher than the first one.
Response:  We know that the first peak is 60 meters high and the second peak is higher than the first one. So, we can assume that the height of the second peak is x meters. Since the total height of both peaks is equal to 93 meters, we can write an equation:  Height of the second peak = Total height - Height of the first peak  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  x = 93 - 60  x = 33 meters  Therefore, the height of the second peak is 33 meters.
Response:  We know that the first peak is 36 km high and we want to find out how many kilometers are in the second peak if it is twice as high as the first one. So, the height of the second peak is twice 36 = 72 km. Now, we need to divide the height of the second peak (72 km) by its base (67 km), which gives us a ratio of 1 : 1.14 or approximately 1.15. Therefore, there are approximately 1.15 times more kilometers in the second peak than in the first one.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out the total area of all three triangles. The perimeter of each triangle is given as follows: Triangle 1 - 66 + 35 + 35 = 136 units Triangle 2 - 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 units Triangle 3 - 66 + 24 + 24 = 90 units Therefore, the total area of all three triangles is equal to their sum: Total Area = 136 + 125 + 90 = 341 units Now, we need to divide this value by the number of sides of each triangle to get the length of one side. For example, for Triangle 1, we have: Length of one side = Total Area / Number of sides = 341 / 3 = 113.33 units Similarly, for Triangle 2 and Triangle 3, we get: Length of one side = Total Area / Number of sides = 341 / 3 = 113.33 units So, the length of one side of the largest triangle (Triangle 1) is approximately 113.33 units.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pixels are in each of the three images. The first image has 91 pixels per inch, so it has 91 x 7 = 637 pixels. The second image has 23 pixels per inch, so it has 23 x 7 = 157 pixels. And the third image has 25 pixels per inch, so it has 25 x 7 = 175 pixels. Now, let's compare the number of pixels in each image with respect to their size. Since all the images are 7 inches wide and long, we can directly compare their pixel count without worrying about scaling or resolution issues. Therefore, the number of pixels in each image is as follows: Image 1 - 637 pixels Image 2 - 157 pixels Image 3 - 175 pixels Based on this information, we can see that the first image (Image 1) has the most number of pixels among the three images, followed by the third image (Image 3). So, the answer to the question is: The first image (Image 1) has more pixels than the other two images combined.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many small pieces are there in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of big pieces with their respective sizes. So, for the first piece, it is 35 x 1 = 35 small pieces. For the second piece, it is 18 x 2 = 36 small pieces. And for the third piece, it is 3 x 3 = 9 small pieces. Therefore, the total number of small pieces is 35 + 36 + 9 = 70 small pieces. Now, let's compare the number of small pieces between the three peatüks. The first peatükk has more small pieces than the other two (70 vs 45 and 25). So, the answer is A - the first peatükk has more small pieces than the others.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pixels are in each of the three images.  The first image has 53 x 80 = 4220 pixels, the second image has 75 x 80 = 6000 pixels and the third image has 21 x 80 = 1680 pixels. Now, let's compare these values:  $ \text{First image} : 4220 \text{ pixels} < \text{Second image}: 6000 \text{ pixels} < \text{Third image}: 1680 \text{ pixels}$ Therefore, the number of pixels in the first image is less than that of the second image, which is less than that of the third image. So, the answer is (A) - the first image has fewer pixels than the third image.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 days in January (peatükki). Now, let's find out how many pages are in each month of the year. According to the information given, there are 61 pages in February (lehekülge pikk). Therefore, if we multiply the number of days in January with the number of pages per month, we get: Number of pages in Raamat = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages. So, the total number of pages in the Bible is 1931 pages.
Response:  We have two peatükkis with different lengths of 23 and 10 lehekülge (or days). To find out how many days are between them, we need to subtract the shorter length from the longer one. So, the difference is: 23 - 10 = 13 lehekülge (or days). Therefore, the second peatükis lasted for 13 days more than the first one.
Response:  We have two peatükkis with different lengths: one is 81 cm long and the other is 68 cm long. To find out which peatukki is longer, we need to compare their lengths directly. So, the length of the second peatukki is 68 cm - 81 cm = -13 cm. Therefore, the second peatukki is shorter than the first peatukki by 13 cm.
Response:  If we have 62 lagritsejas (L) and they are divided into groups of 39 (L), then each group has 1.67 lagritsejas (L). Now, if we want to know how many more lagritsejas there would be if we had 50% more than the number in each group, we can calculate it as follows: Number of additional lagritsejas = Total number of lagritsejas x Percentage increase / 100  Therefore, the answer is: Additional lagritsejas = 62 x 50/100 = 31. So, there would be 31 more lagritsejas if we had 50% more than the number in each group.
Response:  We have to find out how many more layers of bricks are needed for the wall after adding one layer on top of another. So we need to calculate (61 - 52) = 9 more layers of bricks. Therefore, if you add more than 9 layers of bricks on top of each other, there will be more bricks in total than when building a single-layered wall.
Response:  If 32 people can complete a task in one day, and some of them started working later than others, then...
Response:  We have 7 people who threw stones into the water and after that, another 60 people also threw stones into the same water. So in total we have 7 + 60 = 67 people throwing stones into the water. Therefore, the number of stones thrown into the water is 67.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people are there in total. We know that there are 36 men and 13 women. So, the total number of people is 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, the number of pregnant women is 49 - 13 = 36.
Response:  If there are 44 people who can play chess, and they all start playing at the same time, then each person will have to wait for an average of 39 other players before it is their turn again (since there are only 31 players left after 39 rounds). So if more people join in later than those who started earlier, they will have to wait longer for their turn. Therefore, the number of people who will have to wait longer for their turn is greater than the number of people who started earlier.
Response:  If there are 53 people who can play chess, and they play for an hour each, then in total, we have 53 x 1 = 53 hours of playing time.  If there are 48 people who can play chess after lunch, and they play for an hour each, then in total, we have 48 x 1 = 48 hours of playing time.  And if there are 49 people who can play chess at night, and they play for an hour each, then in total, we have 49 x 1 = 49 hours of playing time. So, altogether, we have 53 + 48 + 49 = 150 hours of playing time. Therefore, more people playing chess than at night.
Response:  If there are 33 people who can run fast, and they start running at 8 am, then some of them will finish their race before others. So, let's say that X number of people finished their race between 8 am and 9 am (where X is less than or equal to 33). Now, if we add the time it takes for these people to finish their race (which is approximately 2 hours), we get the total time taken by all 33 people to finish their race, which is approximately 10 am. Therefore, the remaining 34 people started their race after 10 am. Similarly, among the remaining 10 people, only 5 people started their race after 11 am, and the rest (including the 34 people) started their race after 12 pm.
Response:  We have 13 large eggs and 59 small eggs. If we divide them equally among 21 people, each person will get 7 eggs (13 / 21 = 7). So, there are 7 large eggs and 7 small eggs for every 21 people. Therefore, if there are x number of people, then the total number of large eggs is 7x, and the total number of small eggs is 7x.
Response:  We know that there are 29 lagritsejat who can swim and 66 lagritsejat who cannot swim. Out of these, 26 lagritseoj have already crossed the river. Now we want to find out how many more lagritsejaid can cross the river if they all start swimming together after crossing the first 26. So let's assume that from the remaining 40 lagritseja (i.e., those who haven't yet crossed the river), 20 lagritseja can swim. Therefore, the number of lagritseja who can cross the river in total is: Number of lagritseja who can cross the river = Total number of lagritseja - Number of lagritseja who have already crossed the river = 40 - 26 = 14.
Response:  We have 41 lagritsejat (big rocks) and we need to move them from one place to another. Each big rock takes up 4 small spaces in the truck bed. So, if we want to know how many trips it would take to transport all of the big rocks, we can divide the number of big rocks by the number of small spaces available in each trip. In this case, there are 4 small spaces per trip, so we would need: 41 / 4 = 10 trips to transport all of the big rocks. Now let's consider the second part of the question. If we have 4 large rocks that take up 4 small spaces each, then we can calculate the total volume of these large rocks as follows: Volume = Number of rocks x Size of each rock = 4 x 4 = 16 cubic meters. Therefore, we would need 16/4 = 4 trips to transport all of the large rocks. So, in summary, we would need 10 trips to transport all of the big rocks and 4 trips to transport all of the large rocks.
Response:  We know that 46 people participated in the race and 43 of them finished the course. So, we have 46 - 43 = 3 remaining runners who did not finish the course. Therefore, there were 3 runners who dropped out during the race.
Response:  If Rachel's grandmother has an apple tree that produces 7 apples per branch. And if each branch can hold more than one apple. How many apples will there be in total? So we need to find out how many branches are on the tree. Let's assume that the number of branches is x. Then we know that the total number of apples produced by the tree is equal to 7x. Now we want to find out how much Rachel's grandmother gets from selling these apples. Let's say she sells them for $10 per apple. So her total earnings from selling apples would be $10x.
Response:  Racheli has 4 apples and gives away 2 of them to someone else. Now she has 2 apples left. To whom did she give away the remaining 2 apples?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has 7 apples and she gave 3 to her friend. So now Rachel has 7 - 3 = 4 apples left. Then, her friend gave her back 2 apples, so now Rachel has 4 + 2 = 6 apples in total. Therefore, there are 6 apples left after everything is given and taken back.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel's grandmother had 20 apples and gave away 5 of them. So now she has 15 apples left. Then, we are told that there were originally 7 apples more than this number. Therefore, if 6 of these extra apples have been given away, then the remaining amount is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of apples given away, which is 15 - 6 = 9 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel had 8 trees in total and now she has 4 less than before which means she has 4 trees left. Then, we are told that there were 2 more trees than before, so the number of trees Rachel had after she sold some is equal to the number of trees she had before minus 4 plus 2 = 10 - 4 + 2 = 6 trees. Therefore, Rachel had 6 trees at her grandmother's house initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel's grandmother had 4 cups of tea. Then, she gave 2 cups to her daughter (Rachel). So, now Rachel has 2 cups of tea left. Finally, there are 27 cups in total, so if Rachel has 2 cups, then there are 25 cups remaining. Therefore, the number of cups of tea that Rachel's grandmother had at first is 25.
Response:  The tree had 7 branches at first. After that, 2 new branches grew from each of those branches. Now there are 10 branches in total. So, initially, the tree had 7 branches.
Response:  The first tree had two apples. After cutting one apple from it, there were four apples left in total (two from the tree and two from the other tree). So, after cutting another apple from the second tree, there would be five apples in total (four from the previous trees plus one from the new tree). Therefore, if there are currently x apples on the tree, then after cutting one more apple, there will be x + 1 apples on the tree.
Response:  We know that initially there were 52 trees and after cutting 2 trees, there are now 7 more trees. So, we can calculate the number of trees at each stage as follows:  Initially (52 trees): $52$ trees. After cutting $2$ trees: $50$ trees ($=52-2$). Now there are $7$ more trees, so the total number of trees is $50+7=57$ trees. Therefore, the number of trees that were originally planted was $52$.
Response:  We know that initially there were three trees (Rachelil). Now we have cut down six trees (4 + 2 = 6). So now we have 8 trees left (9 - 3 = 8). Therefore, the number of trees that were originally planted is 3.
Response:  We know that Rachel has already cut down 7 trees and now she is cutting the 8th one. So, after cutting the 8th tree, she will have 29 trees left. Therefore, the number of trees Rachel will cut down is 29 - 7 = 22 trees.
"Response:  At first, Edil had 2 more ears than Dougil. Now, Edil has 19 more ears than Dougil. So, initially, Dougil had x ears. Therefore, we can write:

Edil = 2 + x
Dougil = x
Now, we know that Edil has 19 more ears than Dougil, so:

Edil = 2 + x + 19
Dougil = x
Subtracting Edil from both sides gives us:

x = 17
Therefore, Dougil had 17 ears at first."
Response:  If Edil heard 10 times more than Dougil and he was 45 years old, then we can calculate how many times more he heard than Dougil as follows:  Age of Edil = 45 Years Old  Number of Times More Heard Than Dougil = (Age of Edil - Age of Dougil) / Age of Dougil  = (45 - x) / x  Where 'x' is the age of Dougil. Since Dougil was 30 years old, we have:  Number of Times More Heard Than Dougil = (45 - 30) / 30  = 15  So, Edil heard 15 times more than Dougil.
Response:  If Edil had 6 more coins than Dougil and Dougil had 7 of his own coins, then Edil had 6 + 7 = 13 coins in total. So, if Edil had 22 coins now, then Dougil would have 22 - 13 = 9 coins.
Response:  If Edil had 5 more kilograms than Dougil, and Dougil had 3 times as many kilograms as he did in his youth, then we can calculate how much weight Dougil had when he was young. So if Edil had 5 kg more than Dougil, that means Dougil had x kg less than Edil. Then, since Dougil had 3 times as many kilograms as he did in his youth, we know that Dougil had 3x kg when he was young. Now, let's find out how old Dougil was when he had 3x kg:  When Dougil had 3x kg, Edil had 5 kg more than him, so Edil had 5 + x = 27 kg. Therefore, Dougil was x/3 years old when he had 3x kg.
Response:  We know that Ed heard more than Doug did because he heard 9 times as much as Doug did. So if Doug heard 27 sounds, then Ed heard at least 27 x 9 = 243 sounds. Therefore, Ed heard more than Doug did.
Response:  According to the question, Edil had heard 29 more words than Dougil. If Ed heard 17 of those extra words, then we can calculate how many words Edil heard in total as follows:  Total number of words Edil heard = Number of words Dougil heard + Number of words Ed heard from Dougil  Total number of words Edil heard = 17 + x (where x is the number of words Dougil heard)  Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:  Total number of words Edil heard = 17 + 29 = 46  Therefore, Edil heard 46 more words than Dougil.
Response:  At first, Edil was 19 kuuli rohkem kui Dougil, which means that Edil had an advantage of 19 over Dougil. Now, after some time has passed and Edil has gained more experience, he is now 8 kuuli rohkem kui Dougil. So, in total, Edil gained 11 kuuli (19 - 8 = 11) over Dougil.
Response:  If Edil had heard 30 more birds than Dougil, then when Edil was 91 years old, he had heard 91 - 30 = 61 more birds than Dougil. So, the difference in the number of birds heard between Edil and Dougil is 61.
Response:  If Edil had heard 12 more birds than Dougil, and then he heard 20 additional birds, that means Dougil had only heard 8 birds at first (since Edil heard 12 - 8 = 4 more birds). So now Dougil has heard 8 + 20 = 28 birds in total.
Response:  If 408 students want to add sugar to their coffee and 42 of them also want to add cream, then there are in total 450 students who want to add something to their coffee (408 + 42 = 450). Now we need to find out how many students want to add more sugar than others. To do this, let's divide the number of students who want to add cream by the number of students who want to add sugar:  Number of students who want to add more sugar than others = Number of students who want to add cream / Number of students who want to add sugar = 42 / 450 = 1/10. So, one student out of ten wants to add more sugar than others.
Response:  If 479 students want to add chocolate ice cream and 489 students want to add more sprinkles than they already have, then there are more students who want to add sprinkles than those who want to add chocolate ice cream. So, if x is the number of students who want to add chocolate ice cream, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: x + (489 - x) = 479. Solving for x gives us x = 231. Therefore, 231 students want to add chocolate ice cream.
Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 students want to add cheese to their pizza. So, we can say that 62% (185/310) of the students want cheese on their pizza.
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students want to eat pizza and some others want to eat salad. So, we can say that 10% of the students (i.e., 26/288) want to eat salad. Therefore, 90% of the students (i.e., 262/288) want to eat pizza.
Response:  We know that out of 457 students, 63 students liked pineapple and 104 students liked both pineapple and coconut. So, the number of students who liked only coconut is 380 - 63 = 317.
Response:  We know that out of 182 students, 166 students want more than one cookie. So, we have 166 - 1 = 165 students who want at least one cookie. Now, let's find out how many students want exactly two cookies. If 104 students want exactly two cookies, then the number of students who want fewer than two cookies is 165 - 104 = 61. Therefore, there are 61 students who want exactly two cookies.
Response:  If 324 students want to add carrots, and 374 students want to add mayonnaise, then there are in total 698 students who want to add something to their sandwiches. And if 128 students want to add tomatoes, then there are in total 826 students (698 + 128) who want to add something to their sandwiches.
Response:  If 257 students want to add carrots, and 120 of them want to add mayonnaise, then there are 257 + 120 = 377 students who want to add something to their sandwich. If 97 students want to add tomatoes, then there are 377 - 97 = 280 students who do not want to add tomatoes. Therefore, more than half (280/507 = 0.56) of the students prefer carrots over tomatoes.
Response:  If 144 students want to add carrots and 467 students want to add menu items, then there are in total 611 students who want to add something to their meal. And if 79 students want to add tomatoes, then the number of students who do not want to add tomatoes is 532 (611 - 79).
Response:  We have 228 students who want to add carrots and 337 students who want to add sauce to their menu. Among those who want to add sauce, 23 students want to add more than peanut butter. So, the number of students who want to add peanut butter is less than or equal to 23. Therefore, there are at most 23 students who want to add peanut butter.
Response:  We have 450 students who want to add more vegetables to their meals and 170 students who do not want to change anything. So, in total we have 450 + 170 = 620 students. Now let's calculate the percentage of students who want to add more vegetables. To do this, we divide the number of students who want to add more vegetables (450) by the total number of students (620). This gives us 450/620 = 0.72 or approximately 72%. Therefore, about 72% of the students want to add more vegetables to their meals.
Response:  If 218 students want to add chocolate to their ice cream, and 351 students only want to add chocolate to their menu, then we can conclude that more than half of the students (218 + 351 = 569) want to add chocolate to their food. Therefore, the answer is 569.
Response:  We know that out of 269 students, 130 want to add cheese, and out of those who want to add cheese, 76 also want to add tomatoes. So, in total, there are 130 + 76 = 206 students who want to add either cheese or tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 569 students in one class and 236 pupils in another class. If we have more students in the first class than in the second class, then...
Response:  We have 34 tüdrukut and 841 poissi. To find out how many more poissi there are than tüdrukut, we need to subtract the number of tüdrukut from the total number of poissi: 841 - 34 = 807. So, there are 807 more poissi than tüdrukut.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in the school and 232 of them have left. So, we need to find out how many students are still at the school. To do this, we can divide the total number of students (485) by the remaining number of students (232). Therefore, the answer is 485 / 232 = 2.06.
Response:  We know that there are 697 students in one class and 228 of them have more than 10 absences. So, we can calculate the number of students who have less than 10 absences as follows: Number of students with less than 10 absences = Total number of students - Number of students with more than 10 absences = 697 - 228 = 469 students. Therefore, approximately 469/697 x 100% = 65% of the students in this class have less than 10 absences.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 635 tutor students and 278 students who have not taken any exams yet. So, if we subtract the number of non-exam takers from the total number of students, we get 635 - 278 = 357. Now, let's assume that among those who haven't taken any exam, 510 will pass. Therefore, the number of passing students is 510. Finally, to find out how many more passed than failed, we need to subtract the number of failing students (357) from the number of passing students (510), which gives us 510 - 357 = 153.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and 281 of them have more than 50 absences. So, if we subtract the number of students with more than 50 absences from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students - Number of students with more than 50 absences = 868 - 281 = 587 students. Therefore, approximately half of the students (or 587/2 = 293) have fewer than 50 absences.
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in the school and 142 of them have left. So, we need to find out how many students are left at the school. To do this, we can divide the total number of students (700) by the number of students who have left (142). This gives us an estimate of approximately 508 students remaining at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 students in total and 222 of them have passed their exams. So, we can calculate the number of students who did not pass as follows: Number of non-passing students = Total number of students - Number of passing students = 706 - 222 = 484 Now, let's find out how many students were in school at any given time: The number of students in school at any given time is equal to the total number of students divided by the number of exam periods. Since there are 418 exam periods, we can calculate the number of students in school at any given time as follows: Number of students in school at any given time = Total number of students / Number of exam periods = 706 / 418 = 1.7 Based on this calculation, approximately 1.7 students were in school at any given time.
Response:  We know that there are 902 small balls and 811 big balls in total. Since we have counted more than 44 small balls, let's assume that there are x small balls in addition to the 44 already counted. Therefore, the number of small balls is equal to x + 44. Now, we need to find out how many big balls are left after subtracting the number of small balls from the total number of big balls. So, the number of big balls left is equal to 811 - (x + 44).
"Response:  We know that there are 632 tüdrukut and 410 poissi in total. If we divide the number of tüdrukut by the number of poissi, we get  $\frac{632}{410} = \boxed{1.53}$. So, if we have more than $1.53$ times as many tüdrukut as poissi, then the ratio of tüdrukut to poissi is greater than $1$. Therefore, the statement ""Kui palju rohkem tüdrukuid kui poisse on koolis"" (If you have more tüdrukut than poissi, the school is full) is true."
Response:  We know that there are 732 small balls and 761 large balls in total. Also, we know that 682 small balls and 8 large balls are connected. So, if we want to find out how many pairs of connected balls there are, we can use this information. To do this, we need to divide the number of small balls by 2 since each pair of connected balls has two small balls. Therefore, the number of pairs of connected balls is:  Number of pairs = (Number of small balls / 2) = (732 / 2) = 366 pairs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 135 students in one class and 214 students in another class. Therefore, the total number of students is 135 + 214 = 349.  Secondly, we know that the total number of lessons for both classes is 496. So, each student has taken 496 / (135 + 214) = 7.8 lessons.  Finally, since there are 910 pieces of homework, each student has done 910 / (135 + 214) = 9.6 pieces of homework.
Response:  We know that there are 308 students in one class and 318 teachers at the school. So, if we divide the number of teachers (318) by the number of classes (308), we get:  Number of classes = 318 / 308 = 1.0472 or approximately 105 classes. Therefore, if there are more than 105 classes at the school, some of them must have more than 30 students each.
Response:  We know that there are 315 students in one class and 309 teachers. So, if we divide the number of students by the number of teachers, we get: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of teachers  Number of classes = 315/772 = 4.26 classes Therefore, there are approximately 4.26 classes with such a large number of students and teachers.
Response:  We know that Koolis has 402 more units than Poissi. So if Poissi had 739 units, then Koolis must have had at least 739 + 402 = 1141 units.
Response:  We know that Koolis has 458 students in his class and Poissi has 692 students in her class. If we want to find out how many more students Poissi has than Koolis, we can subtract their numbers: 692 - 458 = 234. So, Poissi has 234 more students than Koolis.
Response:  We know that there are 362 pieces of fruit and 257 nuts in the school bag. If we add these two numbers together, we get 619. Now, let's subtract the number of nuts from the total number of items to find out how many more fruits than nuts there are: 619 - 257 = 362. Therefore, if there are more than 362 fruits in the school bag, then there must be at least one nut as well.
Response:  If Edward has $18 and spends $16, then he will have $2 left ($18 - $16). So, there are two options for how much money Edward had before he spent any money: either he had $2 or he had $0 (since he didn't have any money to spend if he had nothing). Therefore, we can conclude that Edward had $2 before he spent any money.
Response:  At first, Edward had $13. Then he spent some money and now he has only $3 left. So, Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward had $9 before he spent anything. Then, he spent $8 and now he has $17 left. So, to find out how much he spent in total, we can subtract the amount he had after spending from the initial amount: $9 - $8 = $1. Therefore, Edward spent $1 more than he initially had.
Response:  Edward had $16 and bought 92 books for $92. So he spent a total of $108. Now he has $4 left. To find out how much money Edward had before spending any money, we need to subtract the amount he spent from his initial balance: $108 - $16 = $92. Therefore, Edward had $92 before buying anything.
Response:  We know that Ed has spent $6 for two books and now he has $12. So, if he buys another book, he will have $12 - $6 = $6 left. Therefore, he can buy at most 6 more books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $6 + $16 = $22. So, Edward had $22 before he spent money. Now, he has $19 left, so he spent $3 ($22 - $19).
Response:  Firstly, we know that $4 was spent on books and $3 were spent on plates. So far, total spending is $7 (4 + 3). Now, there are $12 left after buying these items. To find out how much money Edward spent on each item, we can divide the amount of money left ($12) by the number of items he bought (books and plates): Books - $12 / 4 = $3 per book Plates - $12 / 3 = $4 per plate Therefore, Edward spent $3 on each book and $4 on each plate.
Response:  We know that Edward had $16 for books and $8 for plastic bags. Now he has $19. To find out how much more he spent on books than on plastic bags, we can subtract the amount he had for plastic bags from the total amount he now has: $19 - $8 = $11. So Edward spent $11 more on books than on plastic bags.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $17 dollars and gave $10 to his brother. So he was left with $7 dollars.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 jumping jacks and David did 58 push-ups more than Zachary. So, if we want to find out how many push-ups David did in total, we can use the following equation:  Number of push-ups = Total number of push-ups done by both + (Number of push-ups done by one - Number of push-ups done by other)  In this case, the total number of push-ups done by both is 44 + 58 = 102. Therefore, David did 102 push-ups in total.
Response:  Zachary has 51 likes and David has 44 dislikes today. To find out who got more likes than the other, we need to subtract the number of dislikes from the number of likes for each person. So, Zachary has 51 - 44 = 7 more likes than David. Therefore, Zachary got more likes than David.
Response:  We know that David did 44 sit-ups and he did it 9 times more than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did 44x push-ups. Therefore, the answer is 44x.
Response:  We know that David did 51 sit-ups and Zachary did 49 push-ups more than David. So, if we add up both numbers, we get... (calculate)...David did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary has 59 movements and 44 jumps, so he moves a total of 103 (59 + 44). Now we need to find out how many steps David takes. According to the problem, David takes 19 more steps than Zachary, which means he takes a total of 103 + 19 = 122 steps. Therefore, David took 122 steps.
Response:  We know that Zachary has 44 likes and 17 comments today. David has 29 fewer likes than Zachary, which means he has 29 - 44 = -15 likes. Since we cannot have negative comments, David has 0 comments. Therefore, David has 0 + 17 = 17 comments.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 53 likes and 14 comments today. David made 17 more likes than Zachary but 10 fewer comments than Zachary. So, if we subtract 10 from 17, we get 7. Therefore, Zachary made 53 - 7 = 46 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 sit-ups and 3 knee lifts, while David did 58 more sit-ups than Zachary but 87 fewer crunches than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 58 = 146 push-ups. Therefore, David did 146 - 87 = 59 more push-ups than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary has 46 likes and 58 dislikes this year. So, he has more dislikes than likes.  Now we need to find out how many more dislikes Zachary has than likes. To do this, we subtract the number of likes from the number of dislikes:  Number of dislikes - Number of likes = 58 - 46 = 12  Therefore, Zachary has 12 more dislikes than likes.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 19 turns and David made 39 more turns than Zachary. So, if we subtract the number of turns made by Zachary from the total number of turns made by David, we will get the difference between their numbers of turns. Therefore, the answer is:  David made 20 (39 - 19) more turns than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 turns and David made 22 more turns than Zachary. So, David made 73 turns in total (51 + 22 = 73). Now we are asked how many fewer push-ups John did compared to David. Since John did 4 less push-ups than David, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, the answer is 69.
Response:  Zachary tegi 15 liikuvust (he made 15 turns).  David tegi 39 keerutust (he made 39 stops).  John tegi 9 lülitust (he made 9 slowdowns) less than David. So, Zachary made more stops than John. Therefore, the correct answer is: Zachary tegi rohkem kui John (Zachary made more stops than John).
Response:  If David took 30 steps forward and then turned around to go backward, he would have taken a total of 60 steps (30 + 30). Now, if David takes another 37 steps forward after turning around, Zachary will take 37 - 30 = 7 steps forward. Therefore, Zachary will take a total of 7 + 30 = 37 steps forward.
"Response:  If David has traveled 56 times more than Zachary and he took 38 trips, then we can calculate as follows:
Zachary's number of trips = Total number of trips / Number of times David traveled more than Zachary
= 38 / 56
= 0.69 (or approximately 1/1.5)
So, Zachary took approximately 1/1.5 times as many trips as David did."
Response:  We know that Zachary scored 85 points more than David. So if David scored 40 points, then Zachary scored 40 + 85 = 125 points. Therefore, David scored 17 points less than Zachary.
Response:  We know that David took out 36 cubits more than Zachary. So if Zachary took out 33 cubits, then David took out 36 - 33 = 3 cubits more than Zachary. Now we know that David took out 58 logs and Zachary took out 33 cubits, so the ratio of logs to cubits taken out by David is 58/33 = 1.74. Therefore, David took out approximately 1.74 times as many logs as Zachary did.
Response:  We know that David made 27 mistakes and Zachary made 7 fewer mistakes than David. So, if David made x mistakes, then Zachary made x - 7 mistakes. Now we are given that Zachary made 5 liters of juice and 17 cups of water. If Zachary made x mistakes, then he also drank x - 5 liters of juice and x + 17 cups of water. Therefore, the difference in the number of mistakes between David and Zachary is equal to the difference in the amount of juice they drank: x - (x - 5) = 17. Solving for x, we get x = 12. So, David made 12 more mistakes than Zachary.
Response:  We know that Rachel did 5 hours of math problem solving and 2 hours of reading comprehension. If she spent more time solving math problems than reading, then...
Response:  If Rachel has worked for 3 hours on math problems and 4 hours on reading comprehension, then she has spent in total 3 + 4 = 7 hours studying.  Since there are 20 minutes in an hour, Rachel has studied for 7 x 20 = 140 minutes.
Response:  If Rachel has done 5 math problems and wants to do more, then she will have done a total of 5 + x math problems, where x is the number of additional math problems she wants to do. Since she wants to do more than 7 math problems, we can say that x > 7. Therefore, the number of math problems Rachel has done is equal to 5 + (x - 7).
Response:  If Rachel can solve 4 more math problems than she solves in an hour, and she solves 20 math problems in an hour, then she will solve 24 math problems if she has 3 hours to solve them.
Response:  If Rachel has 3 math problems to solve and she solves each problem in an average time of x minutes, then it will take her total time of 3x minutes to solve all 3 problems. Now if she has more than 3 problems to solve, let's say n problems, then it will take her total time of (n \* x) minutes to solve them all. So, if she has more problems to solve, it will take her less time to solve them compared to solving only 3 problems.
Response:  If Rachel has worked for 6 hours more than she worked math problems, and if she worked 4 hours of math problems, then she worked a total of 10 hours (6 + 4 = 10). So, there are 2 extra hours (10 - 8 = 2) that she didn't work on math problems.
Response:  If Rachel can solve 3 math problems in less than a minute each, and she solves more than one problem at a time, then we can calculate how many problems she can solve overall as follows:  Problem 1: Time taken = x minutes (where x is the time taken to solve the first problem) Problem 2: Time taken = y minutes (where y is the time taken to solve the second problem) Total time taken = x + y minutes Now, if Rachel solves both problems simultaneously, her total time taken will be half of the sum of the times taken for each problem individually. So, the number of problems Rachel can solve in a minute is: Number of problems solved per minute = Total time taken / (x + y) = (x + y) / 2 Now, let's assume that the time taken to solve the first problem is 45 seconds, and the time taken to solve the second problem is 60 seconds. Therefore, the number of problems Rachel can solve in a minute is: Number of problems solved per minute = (45 + 60) / 2 = 90 problems per minute
Response:  Rachel has worked for 2 hours on math problems and 3 hours on reading comprehension tasks. She also spent 10 hours on biology coding. So in total, she worked for 15 hours (2 + 3 + 10).
Response:  We know that Rachel has worked for 9 hours in mathematics and 2 hours in computer science. Therefore, she has worked a total of 9 + 2 = 11 hours. Now, we need to convert this time into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 11 hours is equal to 11 x 60 = 660 minutes. Finally, we can see that Rachel has worked more than 96 minutes in mathematics if we compare it with her work in computer science.
Response:  We know that Rachel did 11 hours of math coding and 2 hours of programming.  If she spent more time doing math coding than programming, then we can say that the ratio of time spent on math coding to time spent on programming is greater than 1. So let's assume that this ratio is x. Now, we also know that Rachel spent 3 hours more on math coding than on programming. Therefore, the total time spent on math coding is 11x + 3, and the total time spent on programming is 2x. Since we want to find out if Rachel spent more time on math coding than on programming, we need to compare these two expressions. Can you simplify them and tell me which one is larger?
Response:  We know that Rachel did 7 hours of math and 11 hours of computer science homework. If she spent more time on math than on computer science, then we can say that the ratio of time spent on math to time spent on computer science is greater than 1. So let's assume that this is the case. Now, we also know that Rachel spent 8 hours on biology homework. Since we want to find out how much time Rachel spent on math and computer science combined, we can subtract the time she spent on biology from the total time she spent on homework. Therefore, the amount of time Rachel spent on math and computer science combined is equal to 7 + 11 - 8 = 6 hours.
Response:  We know that Rachel did 9 hours of math homework and 11 hours of reading for her other class. Additionally, she spent 29 hours studying biology. So in total, Rachel studied for 40 hours (9 + 11 + 29). Therefore, the difference between the time Rachel spent studying math and reading is 3 hours (40 - 3 = 3), since she spent more time studying math than reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel did 8 hours of math work and 7 hours of programming work. Additionally, she spent more than 3 hours working on biology projects. So, we can calculate the total time she spent on all three subjects as follows:  Time spent on math = 8 hours + 7 hours = 15 hours Time spent on programming = 7 hours Time spent on biology = More than 3 hours Total time spent on all three subjects = 15 hours + 7 hours + (more than 3 hours) = 25 hours Therefore, Rachel spent more time on biology projects than on math and programming combined.
Response:  Rachel has worked for 5 hours on math problems and 6 hours on biology problems. So far, she has worked a total of 11 hours (5 + 6).
"Response:  If Rachel spends 2 hours studying topics and 4 hours practicing math problems, then we can calculate how much time she spent in total on each subject as follows:
Topics = Study Time / 2 (since there are two hours of study time) = $10$
Math Problems = Practice Time / 4 (since there are four hours of practice time) = $25$
So, Rachel spent more time practicing math problems than studying topics."
Response:  We know that Rachel has studied for 4 hours in math and 7 hours in science. So far so good! However, we also know that she spent more time studying math than any other subject. Therefore, if we divide the total number of hours she spent studying (19) by the number of subjects she studied (5), we get an average amount of time per subject. In this case, it would be approximately 3.8 hours per subject.
Response:  If Jack has 6 books at home and lends out 2 books, then he has 6 - 2 = 4 books left at home. So, if he lends out more books than he has at home, he will have fewer books left at home. Therefore, the number of books Jack has left at home is less than or equal to 4.
Response:  Jack read six books and after that he bought eight more books. So in total, Jack has read 6 + 8 = 14 books.
Response:  If Jack has sold 10 books and he got $5 for each book, then he earned $50 from selling those 10 books. Now, if he wants to know how many more books he needs to sell to earn $100, we can divide $100 by $5 (the amount he earned per book) to get the number of books he needs to sell: $100 / $5 = 20 books. So, Jack needs to sell 20 more books to earn $100.
Response:  Jack has read six e-books in total and spent three hours reading them. So he has spent an average of five minutes per book (6/3 = 5). Therefore, the number of books Jack can read in one hour is 5 x 60 = 300.
Response:  Jack read six books in two days and seven hours. So he read one book for every 10 hours (6/2 = 3). Therefore, Jack read 3 x 72 = 216 e-books.
Response:  Jack read an electronic book for two hours and eight minutes. So he read it for 168 minutes (2 x 8).
Response:  Jack has three books at home - one for each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday). So he takes two books with him to work - either Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, there are only four options left for Thursday and Friday - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and none of them. Thus, Jack took two books with him to work on Thursday and Friday respectively.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack has already read 7 and 17 electronic books since he started reading them. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 24. Therefore, Jack has read more than 24 electronic books since he started reading them.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack has 9 e-books and he read them for 10 hours and 7 hours respectively. So, we can calculate the total time spent reading e-books as follows: Time spent reading e-books = Total time spent reading + Time spent reading = 10 hours + 7 hours = 17 hours Now, let's find out how many more hours Jack spent reading e-books than on any other day: Difference in time spent reading = Total time spent reading on that day - Time spent reading on any other day = 17 hours - Any other time =? Therefore, according to the question, Jack spent more hours reading e-books on that particular day than on any other day.
Response:  If Jack can read 10 books in one hour and four hours are left before nightfall, then he can read 4 x 10 = 40 books in total before nightfall.
Response:  If Jack read 3 books in one evening and he has already read 5 books before that, then he had read a total of 8 books (5 + 3). So if he gets 10 more e-books to read, he will have read a total of 18 books (10 + 8).
Response:  Jack had 3 books (hommikul) and 64 books in total. After he gave away 5 books, he had 59 books left (5 + 64 - 5 = 59). So, Jack gave away 4 books (kolm e-kirja).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 5 electronic books and 6 paperback books. Then, he received 9 more electronic books and 7 more paperback books. So, in total, Jack has 12 electronic books (including the ones he already had) and 14 paperback books (including the ones he already had). Therefore, the number of paperback books Jack got is 14 - 6 = 8.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack had initially 10 electronic books and 12 paperback books. After that, he gave away 3 electronic books and received 44 additional paperback books. So, at this point, Jack has 7 electronic books (the ones he didn't give away) and 44 + 12 = 56 paperback books. Now, let's compare how many more paperback books Jack got than he gave away: 56 - 3 = 53. Therefore, Jack got 53 more paperback books than he gave away.
Response:  Jack had six books at first and gave away two of them. Then he got eight new books. So, after giving away two books again, how many books does Jack have now? We can calculate it as follows:  Number of books Jack has = Total number of books - Number of books given away twice = 6 - 2 x 2 = 4 Therefore, Jack has four books left after giving away two books for the second time.
Response:  Firstly, Jack had 6 electronic books and gave away 91 of them. So he has 91 - 6 = 85 left. Then he received 2 more electronic books and gave away 74 of them. Therefore, he now has 85 + 2 = 87 electronic books.
Response:  Firstly, Jack had 4 books and gave 2 to his friend. So he has 4 - 2 = 2 books left. Then, he received 6 new books and gave away 8 more. Therefore, he now has 2 + 6 = 8 books.
Response:  If Jack had 9 books and gave away 7 of them, then he has 2 books left (9 - 7 = 2). Now, if he gives away some more books to someone else, let's say 3 more, then he will have 2 - 3 = 1 book left. So, the number of books that Jack has after giving away more than one book is 1.
Response:  If Jack had 3 books in his backpack and he read for 16 hours, then he must have read at least 48 pages (3 x 16 = 48). So, the number of pages Jack read is greater than or equal to 48.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails per hour and worked for 8 hours, he would have received 32 emails in total (4 x 8 = 32). However, if he also read some of them during his breaks, let's assume that he read half of them (16/32 = 50%). So, out of the total number of emails he received, he actually read 50% of them, which is 16 emails. Therefore, Jack read 16 emails after receiving 32 emails in total.
Response:  If rüütel (the girl) has 9 apples and konna (the boy) has 12 apples, then together they have 9 + 12 = 21 apples. So, if they share their apples equally, each of them will get 21 / 2 = 10.5 apples. Since you cannot have half an apple, the final answer is 10 apples for both rüütel and konna.
Response:  We know that Rüütel jumped 31 times and Konni jumped 35 times. So, we need to find out how many jumps they made in total. To do this, we can multiply their individual numbers of jumps: 31 x 35 = 1065. Therefore, Rüütel and Konni together made 1065 jumps.
Response:  We know that rattakas (rat) can jump 36 times its own height. Hiir (mouse) jumps 17 times its own height and konn (dog) jumps 15 times its own height. So if we want to find out how many times kann (cat) can jump its own height, we need to multiply the number of times each animal can jump with their respective heights. Therefore, kann can jump 17 x 15 = 255 times its own height.
Response:  Firstly, we know that rattakas has jumped 25 times higher than konn. So, if rattakas jumps x times higher than konn, then the height of rattakas after x jumps will be 25x. Similarly, we know that konn has jumped 18 times lower than hiir. So, if konn jumps x times lower than hiir, then the height of konn after x jumps will be 18x. Now, let's find out how many times hiir can jump before it reaches the same height as konn. We know that hiir jumps 2 times less than konn, so hiir jumps x - 2 times. Therefore, the height of hiir after x jumps will be 2x. Finally, we need to find out when hiir reaches the same height as konn. To do this, we set up an equation using the information given in the question: 25x = 18(x-2) + 2. Solving for x gives us x = 6. So, hiir can jump 6 times before reaching the same height as konn.
Response:  Firstly, we know that rattakas has jumped 19 times higher than himself. So, his height after each jump is 19 + 1 = 20 times his original height. Similarly, konnanik and hiir have also jumped their respective numbers of times, so their heights are 10 + 1 = 11 times and 20 + 1 = 21 times their original heights respectively. Now, let's compare the heights of all three. Since hiir has jumped more than both rattakas and konnanik, its height is greater than theirs. Therefore, if hiir jumps as high as rohumaal (which is assumed to be equal to 10), then it will be higher than him.
Response:  We know that rattakas has 19 hops, konn has 39 hops and hiir has 94 hops less than konn. So we can calculate the number of hops for each one as follows:  Rattakas: 19 hops Konn: 39 hops Hiir: (94 - 39) = 55 hops Therefore, if konn jumps 10 times more than rattakas, then konn will jump 10 x 19 = 190 hops.
Response:  We know that rattakas has 25 hops, konn has 32 hops more than rattakas, and hiir has 26 hops less than konn. So we can calculate the number of hops for hiir as follows:  Hiir = Konn - (Konn - Rattakas) = 32 - (32 - 25) = 7 To summarize, the number of hops for hiir is 7.
Response:  We know that rattakas (rat) jumped 10 times higher than konn (dog). So, if rattakas jumped 24 times, then konn jumped 24 / 10 = 2.4 times. Now we need to find out how high konn can jump. Since konn jumps 33 times higher than hiir (cat), so konn jumped 33 - 5 = 28 times higher than hiir. Therefore, the height of konn is 28 x 2.4 = 67.2 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rüütel has 40 eggs and Konna has 60 eggs. So, together they have 100 eggs. Now, let's calculate how many eggs each of them can sell. According to the problem, Rüütel can sell 80% of his eggs, which is 80/100 = 0.8 eggs. Similarly, Konna can sell 70% of her eggs, which is 70/100 = 0.7 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs that both of them can sell together is 0.8 + 0.7 = 1.5 eggs. Since 1 egg costs 1 tolla, the total amount of money they can earn from selling eggs is 1.5 x 1 = 1 tolla.
Response:  The first rabbit jumped 35 times and the second rabbit jumped 4 times as many jumps as the first rabbit. So, if the first rabbit jumped 35 times, then the second rabbit jumped 35 x 2 = 70 times. Therefore, there were 70 jumps in total.
Response:  We know that rattakas (rat) jumps 19 times. A dog jumps 4 times as high as its own height. And a hare jumps 44 times as high as its own length. So if we want to find out how many times konn (dog) jumps, we can use the following formula: Konn jumps = (Rattakas jumps x Dog jumps per height) / (Hare jumps x Hare length)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Konn jumps = (19 x 4) / (44 x 44) = 320  Therefore, konn (dog) jumps 320 times.
Response:  We know that rattakas has 39 hops, rott has 19 hops, and konn has 12 hops. Now let's calculate how many hops the combined creature would have if we combine their hops. The total number of hops for all three creatures is equal to the sum of their individual hops. So, in this case, it would be: 39 + 19 + 12 = 70 hops. Therefore, the combined creature would have 70 hops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that rats (Rattus norvegicus) can jump up to 20 times their body length in a single bound. Therefore, if a rat is 30 cm long, it can jump up to 600 cm or 6 meters. Now let's consider the size of a cat (Felis catus). According to various sources, a domesticated housecat can leap up to 5 times its own height. So if a cat is 70 cm tall at the shoulder, it can leap up to 350 cm or 3.5 meters. Next, we have dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), which are known for their agility and jumping ability. Dogs can leap up to 4-5 times their own height, depending on breed and size. For example, a small dog like a Chihuahua may only be able to leap about 20-30 cm high, while a larger breed like a Great Dane could potentially reach as high as 90 cm or more. Finally, there are birds such as pigeons (Columba livia) and doves (Streptopelia spp.), which are also capable of impressive jumps. Pigeons can fly up to 80-100 km/h and cover distances of over 100 km in a single day, making them excellent fliers. However, when it comes to jumping ability, they don't quite compare to other animals mentioned above. In conclusion, based on these examples provided earlier, it seems likely that if given enough space and motivation, any animal with sufficient strength and flexibility would be able to clear obstacles similar to those encountered during daily life activities without too much difficulty - especially if they had been trained specifically for this purpose!
Response:  If the first person has 39 tokens and the second person has 17 tokens, then if they exchange one token each, the total number of tokens will be: 39 + 17 = 56 tokens. Therefore, the third person would have 56 - 39 = 17 tokens more than the second person.
Response:  Firstly, we know that rattakas (rat) is smaller than konkanik (rabbit). So, if the height of the rat is 9 cm and the height of the rabbit is 10 cm less than the rat, then the height of the rabbit is 9 - 10 = 1 cm. Therefore, the height of the rabbit is 1 cm.
Response:  We know that rattakas (rat) can jump 10 times its own height. A hare can jump 14 times its own length and a fox 16 times its own length less than a hare. If a rat jumps as high as a hare, how many times will it be able to jump its own length?
Response:  We have 14 pieces of chicken and 6 pieces of sugar. So in total we have 20 pieces (14 + 6). Now we want to know how many more pieces of chicken there are than pieces of sugar. To find this out, we subtract the number of pieces of sugar from the total number of pieces: 20 - 6 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 more pieces of chicken than pieces of sugar.
Response:  We have 9 cups of rice and 11 cups of sugar. If we want to make 4 times as much rice as sugar, we need to add 4 x 11 = 44 cups of sugar. So, there are 44 more cups of sugar than rice.
Response:  We have 6 cups of rice and 13 cups of sugar. If we want to add more rice, let's say we need at least 8 cups of rice to make it even. So, if we add 8 cups of rice, how many cups of sugar will be left? Therefore, the answer is 5 cups (13 - 8 = 5).
Response:  We have 11 pieces of cake and 7 pieces of fruit. If we take more than 2 pieces of cake, then how many pieces of cake will be left for us? So, there will be 4 pieces of cake left (11 - 2 = 4).
Response:  We have 11 cups of sugar and we want to know how many cups are left after adding 3 more cups. So, if we add 6 more cups, then we will have 17 cups (11 + 3 = 17). Therefore, there are 4 more cups than the recipe requires (17 - 11 = 4).
Response:  We have 12 pieces of cake and 5 pieces of fruit. If we take more than 2 pieces of cake, then how many pieces of cake will we have left? So if we take 3 pieces of cake, we will have 9 pieces of cake left (12 - 3 = 9).
Response:  We have 9 cups of rice and we want to add more. So, let's start with adding 3 cups of rice. Now, we have 12 cups (9 + 3) of rice. Next, we need to subtract 5 cups of sugar from our total amount of rice. So, now we have 7 cups of rice left (12 - 5). Finally, we are asked how many cups of rice will be left if we add another 3 cups. Therefore, the answer is 4 cups of rice will be left after adding another 3 cups (7 - 3 = 4).
Response:  We have 5 pieces of cake and 14 pieces of fruit. So far so good! Then we add 10 more pieces of cake and 2 more pieces of fruit. Now let's calculate how many pieces of fruit are left over. To do this, we subtract the number of additional pieces of fruit from the total amount of fruit. In this case, that would be 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit. Therefore, there are 12 pieces of fruit left over.
Response:  We have 12 cups of rice (kooki), and we need to add 5 cups of sugar (suhkrut) and 49 cups of water (soola). So, in total, we have 12 + 5 + 49 = 66 cups of liquid ingredients. Now, if we take away the amount of liquid used (11 cups), we are left with 66 - 11 = 55 cups of excess liquid. Therefore, the remaining amount of liquid is 55 cups.
Response:  We have 10 cups of rice and we want to know how much more than 7 cups is left. So, let's subtract 7 from 10: 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 cups of rice left after cooking 7 cups.
Response:  We have 12 tablespoons of sugar and 7 tablespoons of oil. If we want to add more sugar than oil, we need to know how much more. So, if we want to add 3 tablespoons of sugar (which is equal to 0.5 cups), then we will have 9 tablespoons of oil left (since 1 cup of oil = 16 tablespoons). Therefore, the amount of oil that can be added without exceeding the total amount of ingredients is 9 tablespoons.
Response:  We have 6 tablespoons of sugar and 8 tablespoons of honey. If we add more sugar than honey, we will have too much sugar. So let's start with adding 1 table spoon of sugar at a time until we reach the desired amount. Therefore, the next addition would be 7 tablespoons of sugar (not honey). After that, we can continue to add 1 tablespoon of sugar at a time until we reach the total amount of 5 tablespoons. Thus, the final answer is 5 + 7 = 12 tablespoons of sugar added to the mixture.
Response:  We have 12 cups of rice and 13 cups of sugar. If we take away two cups of sugar, then we will have how many cups of sugar left? Therefore, there are 11 cups of sugar left.
Response:  We have 9 cups of rice and 6 cups of sugar. If we want to make 4 times as much sugar as rice, we need to add 4 x 9 = 36 cups of sugar. So, there will be 36 - 6 = 30 cups of sugar left after adding the required amount for 4 times the rice.
Response:  We have 6 tablespoons of sugar and 9 tablespoons of jam. If we add 2 more tablespoons of jam, then we will have 11 tablespoons of jam in total. So, to find out how much more jam there is than sugar, we can subtract the amount of sugar from the total amount of jam: 11 - 6 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 tablespoons of jam more than sugar.
Response:  We have 5 cups of sugar and we want to make 11 cups of jam. So, we need to add more sugar than we already have. The ratio between sugar and jam is 14:1, so for every 1 cup of sugar, we can make 14 cups of jam. Therefore, if we want to make 11 cups of jam, we will need an additional 3 cups of sugar (11 x 14 = 154).
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 3 batches of soup and each batch contains 10 cups of water. If she wants to make more soup, she needs at least 5 additional cups of water. So, in total, Mary will have 3 x 10 = 30 cups of water for her next batch of soup.
Response:  We know that Mary has cooked 5 cups of soup and wants to add more. If she adds 13 cups of water, some of them will spill over. So, if she adds even more than 12 cups of water, how many cups of soup will be left in the pot?  Solution: To find out how many cups of soup will be left in the pot, we need to subtract the amount of water added (13 cups) from the total amount of soup (5 cups + however much more is added). Therefore, if Mary adds even more than 12 cups of water, there will be x - 12 = 3 cups of soup left in the pot, where x is the number of additional cups of water added.
Response:  We have 7 tassi jahu and 60 tassi suhkrut. To find out how many more tassi jahu we need to add to reach 14 tassi jahu, we can divide 60 by 7. So, we need 8 more tassi jahu. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. So we need to make 12 cups of dough and 10 cups of sugar. Therefore, there is still one cup of sugar left over.
Response:  We have 3 cups of sugar (10 tassi), 15 cups of flour (jahu), and 6 cups of water (pani). To find out how much more water is needed to make 1 cup of dough, we can divide the amount of water by the number of cups of dough required: 6 / 1 = 6. So, we need an additional 6 cups of water to make 1 cup of dough. Therefore, the total amount of water needed to make all the dough is: 6 + 6 = 12 cups.
Response:  We have 9 cups of sugar (tassi suhkrut), which is equal to 360 grams (g).  Then we have 14 cups of flour (jahu), which is equal to 560 g. Finally, we have 40 cups of oil (soola), which is equal to 1280 g. So in total, we have 360 + 560 + 1280 = 2100 g of ingredients. Now let's calculate how much more than 40 cups of flour we need. To do this, we divide the total amount of ingredients by 40, which gives us 525 g (or approximately 18.4 oz) more than 40 cups of flour. Therefore, if we want to make enough dough for 9 tassi jahu, we will need at least 14 + 525 = 541 g (or approximately 19 oz) of flour.
Response:  We have 9 cups of sugar (kooki), 7 cups of flour (jahu), and 4 cups of oil (soola). If we want to add more oil than flour, we need to know how much more. So, if we want to add twice as much oil as flour, we will add 2 x 7 = 14 cups of oil. Therefore, the total amount of ingredients needed is 9 + 7 + 14 = 30 cups.
Response:  We have 11 cups of sugar, 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of oil. If we want to make 12 cups of jam, we need more oil than sugar or flour. So, we can add up to 3 more cups of oil (since 9 is already used). Therefore, we will need 12 + 3 = 15 cups of oil in total.
Response:  We have 7 tablespoons of sugar and 10 tablespoons of jam. If we use 4 tablespoons of sugar to make one batch of pancake batter, then how many batches can we make with the given amount of sugar? So, the number of batches is equal to the total amount of sugar divided by the amount of sugar needed for each batch. Therefore, the number of batches is 7/4 = 1.75 batches. Since we cannot make half a batch, the remaining amount is 1.75 - 0.5 = 1.25 batches. Now, let's calculate the number of pancakes we can make with the remaining amount of sugar. To do this, divide the remaining amount of sugar (1.25) by the amount of sugar needed for each pancake (0.25). So, we can make 4.83 pancakes with the remaining amount of sugar. However, since we cannot make fractional batches or pancakes, the whole number closest to the calculated value is 5 batches or pancakes. Therefore, there are approximately 5 batches or pancakes left after using all the given amount of sugar.
Response:  We have 12 tablespoons of sugar and 14 tablespoons of jam. If we want to add more jam than sugar, we need to know how much more. So let's subtract the amount of sugar from the total amount of ingredients: 14 - 12 = 2 tablespoons. Therefore, we can add up to 2 more tablespoons of jam than sugar.
Response:  If there are 19 birds per tree and each bird can build 60 nests in winter, then how many nests will be built in total if some birds build more than others?
Response:  If there are 87 birds in total and 7 of them fly south for winter, how many will remain in Estonia if more than 50% of them flew away?
Response:  We have 20 birds that fly south for winter and 14 of them return in spring. How many birds did not come back? To find out we need to subtract the number of birds that returned from the total number of birds that flew south. So, the answer is: 20 - 14 = 6
Response:  We have 85 birds that fly over different countries. Out of these, 23 birds fly over Africa and 37 birds fly over Asia. So, how many birds did not fly over any country?  Solution: The remaining 25 birds flew over neither Africa nor Asia.
Response:  We have 8 countries in Europe and we know that 42 countries are located in Africa and 31 countries are located in Asia. So, if there are more than 4 times as many countries in Africa as in Asia, then...
Response:  We have 38 birds in Europe and 94 birds in Asia. If we divide the number of birds in Asia by the number of birds in Europe, we get 2.5 (94/38). So there are approximately twice as many birds in Asia as there are in Europe.
Response:  We have 18 countries in Europe and 38 countries in Africa. If we assume that each country has roughly the same number of people as there are countries, then... (calculate)...we can see that there are approximately... (calculate)...people living in these countries!
Response:  We have 87 birds in total and they are divided into three groups of 29, 30, and 38 birds respectively. If we add 18 new birds to one of the groups, how many birds will there be in that group now?
Response:  We know that there are 49 birds in total and they migrate for 59 days. So, during this time, some of them will have already returned to their summer homes. Let's assume that 24 birds return from the Arctic region. Now, we need to calculate how many birds remain in the area where they were observed. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of birds remaining = Total number of birds - Number of birds that returned to summer home. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of birds remaining = 49 - 24 = 25. Therefore, out of the initial 49 birds, 25 remained in the area where they were observed.
Response:  We have 27 birds that migrate south and 41 birds that stay in their nests during winter. If each nest contains an average of 3 eggs per bird (which is a rough estimate), then we can calculate how many eggs are left behind. So, if 41 birds stayed in their nests, they would leave behind 41 x 3 = 123 eggs.
Response:  We have 86 birds that fly south for winter and they divide equally among 45 trees. If each tree can hold 3 birds, then how many birds will be left behind?
Response:  We have 41 countries in Europe and 62 countries in Africa. If we divide the number of countries in Africa (62) by the number of countries in Europe (41), we get 1.5 or approximately 1.5 times more countries in Africa than in Europe. Therefore, there are approximately 1.5 times more countries in Africa than in Europe.
Response:  We have 3 birds that fly south for winter and they stay in Argentina for 2 months. During this time, another 2 birds come from Europe to join them. How many birds are left in Estonia after these movements?
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 253 votes for him in total. The school year had 70 students who did not vote or abstained from voting. So, we need to find out how many votes Paul got from the remaining students. To do this, we can use division. If there are 253 votes for Paul and 70 students did not vote or abstained, then the number of votes he got is equal to 253 / 70 = 3.56. Therefore, Paul received approximately 3 votes per student on average.
Response:  We know that there were 551 students in total, but only 177 passed the examination. So, we need to find out how many students failed the examination. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of failures = Total number of students - Number of passers. In this case, the number of failures is equal to 551 - 177 = 374. Therefore, 374 students failed the examination.
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 440 votes for him in total. Of those, he got 111 votes from his own school, which means he received 25% of the total votes (111/440 x 100%). Additionally, he got 99 votes from other schools, which means he received another 22% of the total votes (99/440 x 100%). Therefore, the percentage of votes that Paul received is 25 + 22 = 47%.
Response:  We know that there were 65 survivors at the end of the war. If we subtract the number of those who died (213) from the total number of prisoners (478), then we get the number of people who were released: $478 - 213 = 265$. Therefore, $265$ people were released.
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 589 votes for him in total. Of those, he got 571 valid votes, which is the same as the number of invalid votes (161). If we had more valid votes than invalid votes, how many more would it be?
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 110 workers in total. And we also know that 90 of them worked for one year and then retired, leaving 20 workers remaining. Now let's calculate how many more workers are needed to reach 412 workers if they work for an average of 3 years each. So, we need (412 - 90) / 3 = 68 additional workers. Therefore, the correct answer is 68.
Response:  We know that there are 563 votes in total, but only 558 valid votes. So, we need to find out how many invalid votes were cast. If there were 332 valid votes, then the number of invalid votes would be equal to 563 - 332 = 231. Therefore, the number of valid votes per day is 332 / 231 = 1407.
Response:  We know that there are 52 weeks in a year, so if we have $X$ amount of money saved every week for one year, then we can calculate it as follows: $$ X \times 52 = Total\ savings $$ Now, we are given that Paul has saved $535$ worth of money, which means he has saved $\frac{535}{52} = 10$ dollars per week. But wait! There's more! According to the question, Paul had only $492$ worth of money left after some were lost or taken away. So let's subtract that from our total savings: $$ Total\ savings = 10 \times 52 - 492 = 448 $$ Therefore, the answer is $448$.
Response:  We know that there were 521 successful attempts and 66 failed attempts. So, in total, there were 587 attempts (521 + 66). Now, we need to find out how many of these attempts resulted in a correct solution. Since none of the failed attempts led to a correct solution, we can say that all successful attempts did lead to a correct solution. Therefore, the number of correct solutions is equal to the number of successful attempts, which is 521. Finally, we subtract the number of incorrect attempts from the total number of attempts to get the number of correct attempts, which is 521 - 66 = 455.
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 531 votes for and 38 against. So, if we subtract the number of votes against from the total number of votes, we get 503 (531 - 38). Now, let's divide this number by the number of people who voted (467), which gives us approximately 1.09 or 109%. Therefore, more than 100% of the voters did not change their minds.
Response:  We know that there were 601 successful attempts and 406 rejected applications. The total number of applicants was 336 people, but none of them got more than one rejection. So, if we subtract the number of successful attempts from the total number of applicants, we get the number of people who applied only once:  $336 - 601 = 275$ Therefore, there were 275 people who applied only once.
Response:  We know that Paul had 291 apples in his basket at the beginning of summer. He gave away some or sold them during the summer, so he had fewer apples when it ended. If he had 315 apples left at the end of summer, then we can calculate how many he gave away or sold as follows: Number of apples given away/sold = Total number of apples at the end of summer - Initial number of apples at the beginning of summer Number of apples given away/sold = 315 - 291 = 24 Therefore, Paul gave away/sold 24 apples during the summer.
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 267 votes for him in total. Of those, 231 votes came from people who also voted for him last time around (kaotas), while 308 votes came from new voters (andis). So if we add up all these numbers, we get: 231 + 308 = 539. Therefore, there are more than 500 votes for Paul this time around compared to last time.
Response:  We know that Paul said there were 457 successful casts and 320 failed attempts. The total number of tries was 523, but he did not count any more than 457 successes. So, we can conclude that the remaining amount is equal to the difference between the total number of tries (523) and the number of successful casts (457). Therefore, the amount left over is 523 - 457 = 66.
Response:  If there were initially 11 clients and some of them left, then there were at most 3 clients remaining when all the others had left. So, the number of clients that remained is 3.
Response:  If one chef had three clients and some of them left, there were more than four clients in total. So, if half of the remaining clients left, then there would be twice as many clients as before they left. Therefore, the number of clients after they left is equal to twice the original number plus two.  Thus, the final answer is: 2 + 3 = 5
Response:  If there were initially 9 clients and after their arrival, 12 more clients arrived, then we have to find out how many total clients are now in the restaurant. So, the final number of clients is: 9 + 12 = 21 clients.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 clients and now only 5 remain. To find out how many clients left, we can subtract the number of remaining clients from the initial number of clients. So, the answer is: 5 - 14 = -9. Therefore, 9 clients left.
"Response:  At first, there were 13 clients. When some left and new ones joined, there were 9 clients remaining. So, the number of clients who have been with the restaurant for more than half its lifetime is:

$$ \boxed{5} $$

Explanation:
Let's count the number of clients at each stage:

1. Initially, there were 13 clients.
2. Some clients left, leaving 9 clients.

So, the number of clients who have been with the restaurant for more than half its lifetime (9 - 13) / 2 = 5 clients."
Response:  If there were initially 12 clients and after 15 more clients joined, then the total number of clients is: 12 + (15 x 1) = 37 clients.
Response:  If there were initially three clients (k1), and then four more clients arrived (k2 + k3 + k4), so in total we have 7 clients (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4). Now if another client arrives (k5), the total number of clients is 8 (k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5). Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  If the chef had 6 clients at first and gained 5 more clients, then he has now 11 clients in total (6 + 5 = 11). Now if he gets 99 new clients, he will have 110 clients in total (11 + 99 = 110).
Response:  At first, there were 12 clients. When some of them left, there were 14 clients. Then, he got 10 new clients. So, now there are... (calculate)...14 + 10 = 24 clients.
Response:  If he bought $3 worth of candy after selling $2 worth of chocolate bars, then he gained $1 from the sale of the chocolate bars. So, his total profit is $1 + $2 = $3.
Response:  If he had 4 dollars before and spent $3 on candy, then he has $1 left. So, if he buys more chocolate that costs $5, he will have $0 left. Therefore, the maximum amount of money he can spend is $0.
Response:  If you have $4 and you spend $3, then you will have $1 left. Now let's say you want to buy something that costs $50. You don't have enough money, so you need to borrow $45 from someone. After paying back the loan, you will have $1 left again. So in total, you will have spent $3 + $45 = $48. Therefore, you will have $1 - $48 = $-47 left.
Response:  If we have $3 and want to buy two commodities for $4 each, then we will spend $8 in total. So, if we can buy more than eight commodities with one dollar, then...
Response:  If he paid $6 for some chocolates and $3 for another item, then...
Response:  If you buy one chocolate bar for $2 and another for $3, then in total you have spent $5 (2 + 3 = 5). So if you have more money left over, it means that you have $7 - $5 = $2 left. Therefore, there is $2 left over.
Response:  If you buy one chocolate bar for $7 and another for $6, then in total you have spent $7 + $6 = $13. So, if you spend more money on chocolates, it means that you bought more chocolates. Therefore, the answer is $13.
Response:  If you buy $6 worth of chocolate and $3 worth of chocolate, then the total amount spent is $6 + $3 = $9. So, if you spend more money buying chocolate than you do ice cream.
Response:  If you buy $2 chocolate and $3 chocolate, then the total cost is $5 (2 + 3 = 5). Now let's say you want to know how much more expensive the third chocolate is compared to the first one. So, we need to find the difference between their costs: $3 - $2 = $1. Therefore, for every additional dollar you spend on chocolate, you get $1 extra.
Response:  If they bought chocolate for $8 and had $4 left over, that means they spent $8 + $4 = $12 in total. Now, if they gave each of their friends $5, then they would have $5 x 3 = $15 left over after giving away the money. So, there is still $15 - $12 = $3 more money left over than when they started with.
Response:  If Daniel had $3 left after buying chocolate, and then he spent $4 more, how much money does he have now? So, the answer is $7 ($3 + $4).
Response:  If Danil has $4 and wants to buy 10 chocolates for $3 each, he will have spent all of his money. So, if he spends more than $4, he will have less money left. Therefore, the amount he will have left is $4 - $3 x 10 = $4 - $30 = $-26.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danil has $3 and wants to buy chocolates worth $4 each. So he can buy at most 4 chocolates with his money. Now let's calculate how many chocolates he can buy if he pays the same amount for each one:

$4 x number of chocolates = total cost

We are given that the total cost is equal to the amount of money Danil has ($3). Therefore, we can set up an equation:

$4x = $3

Now, dividing both sides of the equation by $4 gives us:

x = $\frac{3}{4}$

So, Danil can buy $\frac{3}{4}$ chocolate bars with the $3 dollars he has."
Response:  If Danil spends $3 for chocolate and $7 for ice cream, then he spent a total of $10. Now let's say he wants to buy more chocolate. If he buys another piece of chocolate that costs $5, then his new total amount spent will be $15 ($10 + $5). So, if he continues to spend money on chocolate at this rate, he will spend more than he did on ice cream. Therefore, the answer is (A) More than $7.
Response:  If Danil spends $7 for chocolate and $2 for commodities at the store, then he has spent a total of $9 (7 + 2). Now let's compare this amount to the price of the chocolate bar. According to the question, if Danil buys more chocolate than the bar costs, then he will have $1 left over after buying the chocolate bar. So, we can set up an equation as follows: $9 = $7 + $2 - $1. Solving for $1, we get: $1 = $6. Therefore, Danil has $6 left over after buying the chocolate bar.
Response:  We know that Pauli had 115 books and he gave away 78 of them to his grandson. So, we need to find out how many books Pauli had left. To do this, we can subtract the number of books he gave away from the total number of books he had. Therefore, the answer is: 115 - 78 = 37.
"Response:  We know that after 137 years, there were only 105 books left. So, we can calculate how many books were initially written using the following formula: Number of books = Total number of books x (1 / (1 + interest rate)^years) Where ""interest rate"" is the percentage at which the books are lost each year. For example, if the interest rate is 2%, then every year, 2% of the total number of books will be lost. In this case, after 137 years, 28 books will have been lost (2% of 105), leaving us with 77 books. Therefore, the initial number of books was 105."
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially. After he gave some of them away and now has 35 left in his possession, we have 62 - 35 = 27 books remaining with him. So, Paul gave away 71 books (108 - 35).
Response:  If Pauli had 50 books and he gave away 151 more, then he has now 61 (50 + 151) books in total.
Response:  If Paul had two books and gave some to Mary, then he has less than before. So let's say he has x books left. Then if Mary took 150 more books from him, she would have x + 150 books now. Since there are 58 books in total, we can calculate that x = 34 (books). Therefore, Paul had 34 books left after giving some to Mary.
"Response:  If Paul had 21 books before he bought some more and now has 42 books in total, then we can calculate how many additional books he bought as follows:

Additional books = Total number of books - Initial number of books
= 42 - 21
= 21

So, Paul bought 21 more books than he initially had."
Response:  If Paul had 71 books before and bought 38 new ones after that, then he has in total 109 books now (71 + 38 = 109). So if he already had more than 100 books, he must have bought at least 57 more books (109 - 57 = 52) than he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 plates before he mixed them with other people's books and plates. After mixing, there were 66 books and 59 plates altogether. To find out how many books Paul had after mixing, we can divide the total number of books (66) by the number of books Paul had initially (108): 66/108 = 0.61 or approximately 61%. Similarly, to find out how many plates Paul had after mixing, we can divide the total number of plates (59) by the number of plates Paul had initially (55): 59/55 = 1.07 or approximately 107%. So, Paul had 61% of the original 108 books and 107% of the original 55 plates after mixing with others.
Response:  We know that Paul had 51 books and 106 plates before he gave some away. After giving them away, he had 82 books and 14 plates left. To find out how many plates Paul gave away, we can subtract the number of plates he had after giving them away from the total number of plates he had before giving them away: 106 - 14 = 92 plates. So Paul gave away 92 plates.
"Response:  If Paul has 27 books and he gave some to Tall, then we can say that Tall got x books from Paul. Since Tall had 136 books initially, we can write the equation:
x + 136 = 27
Now solve for x:
x = 109
So Tall received 109 books from Paul."
Response:  If Paul had 134 books before he gave away 39 of them to his friend, then he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Now, if he mixed some of those books with others in a garage sale, let's say he mixed 20 books from his remaining 95 books, then he has 75 books left after the mix (95 - 20 = 75). So, the number of books that Paul gave away at the garage sale is 20.
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 books and 153 scrolls initially. After he read some of them and gave away others, he was left with 13 books and 23 scrolls. So, there were 106 (95 + 13) books in total that Paul read or gave away.
Response:  We know that there were initially 42 plates and 143 books. After some of the books and plates were moved, there were 113 books and 19 plates left. To find out how many plates were transferred, we need to subtract the number of plates left after the movement from the initial number of plates. Therefore, the answer is 42 - 19 = 23 plates transferred.
Response:  If Jessica had 6 apples and gave 4 to her little brother, then she has 2 apples left. Now, if we add 3 more apples to that amount, we get 5 apples in total. So, there are 5 apples now.
"Response: 
Vaasil was born as a boy and now he is 23 years old. If he had 16 toys when he was little, then he must have collected 7 more toys since then (23 - 16 = 7). So, there are 7 additional toys that Vaasil has collected over time."
"Response: 
Vaasil had two roses at first (1 rose). Then he got four more roses from Jessica (4 roses), and then he gave three of them to his friend Linda (3 roses). So far, Vaasil has 7 roses. Now, he is 23 years old, so let's assume that he gets one new rose for each year of his age. Therefore, Vaasil will get 23 + 1 = 24 roses in total."
"Response: 
Vaasil was initially 15 years old and grew by 2 years (33 - 15 = 18). Now he is 17 years old. If Jessica grows as much as Vaasil did in one year, then she will be 35 years old (18 + 1 = 35)."
"Response: 
Vaasil was initially 21 roses and Jessica gave him 34 more roses. So now Vaasil has 55 roses (21 + 34). If Jessica gives him even more roses in the future, then Vaasil will have more than 55 roses. Therefore, the answer is greater than 55."
Response:  We know that Jessica had 59 roses and gave some of them to Vasil. Now Vasil has 20 roses left. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica gave to Vasil as follows: Number of roses given = Total number of roses - Number of roses left with Vasil = 59 - 20 = 39 roses. Therefore, Vasil received 39 roses from Jessica.
"Response: 
Vaasil was initially 13 years old. He grew 8 years (from 13 to 21). So, in total he has grown 8 + 1 = 9 years."
Response:  We know that Vaasil had 15 roses and 62 orchids initially. Then he added more roses and orchids to his collection. Now he has 17 roses and 96 orchids in total. So, we can calculate how many new roses and orchids he got as follows: New roses = Old roses + Additional roses = 15 + (17 - 15) = 4 New orchids = Old orchids + Additional orchids = 62 + (96 - 62) = 34 Therefore, Jessica planted 4 new roses and 34 new orchids.
Response:  We know that Vaasil had 12 roses and 2 orchids initially. Then, Jessica took some of his roses and orchids. Now, Vaasil has 10 roses and 21 orchids. So, we can calculate how many orchids Jessica took as follows: Number of orchids taken = Total number of orchids - New number of orchids = 21 - 2 = 19 Orchids. Therefore, Jessica took 19 orchids from Vaasil.
"Response: 
Vaasil had initially 5 roses and 3 orchids. 
Jessica added more roses to her collection, but she also gave some of them away. So, after Jessica's addition/removal process, Vaasil had 12 roses and 2 orchids left.
Now, if we want to find out how many more roses than orchids Vaasil has now, we can simply subtract the number of orchids from the total number of roses:
Number of roses - Number of orchids = More roses than orchids
12 - 2 = 10
So, there are 10 more roses than orchids in Vaasil's current collection."
"Response: 
Vaasil had initially 7 roses and 12 orchids. After Jessica took some of his roses and orchids, Vaasil was left with 5 roses and 9 orchids. Now, Vaasil has 11 roses and 20 orchids. So, if there are more orchids than roses now, then Vaasil has 3 more orchids than roses (20 - 11 = 9). Therefore, for every rose that Vaasil has, he has 4 more orchids (3/1 = 4)"
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses and now there are 19 roses, then we can calculate how many roses have grown as follows: Number of roses that grew = Current number of roses - Initial number of roses Number of roses that grew = 19 - 3 = 16 Therefore, 16 roses have grown.
Response:  We know that Vaasil had 13 roses and 84 orchids initially. Then he added more orchids but not roses. Now he has 91 orchids and 14 roses. So, the number of roses Jessica gave him is 14 - 13 = 1 rose.
"Response:  We know that Vaasil had 16 roses and 3 orchids initially. Then he got more roses (but not orchids). So, let's say he got x new roses. Now, we have:

Vaasil has 16 + x = 20 roses now.
We also know that he lost some orchids, so let's say he lost y orchids. Therefore, we have:

Vaasil has 3 - y = 2 orchids left.
Now, we want to find out how many orchids Jessica gave him. Since she gave him ""veel"" orchids, we can assume that she gave him at least one orchid. So, let's say she gave him k orchids. Therefore, we have:

Jessica gave Vaasil k orchids.
Now, we can use the information given in the question to solve for k:

Knowing that Vaasil has 7 orchids and 13 roses now, we can write:

7 + k = 13
Solving for k, we get:

k = 6
Therefore, Jessica gave Vaasil 6 orchids."
"Response: 
Vaasil had initially 6 roses and 20 orchids. After Jessica took some of his lily pots, he now has 21 orchids and 22 roses. If there are more roses than orchids in Vaasil's garden now, how many more roses does he have than orchids?  Therefore, the answer is 22 - 20 = 2 more roses than orchids in Vaasil's garden now."
"Response: 
Vaasil had 8 roses and 6 orchids initially. 
Jessica added more roses and orchids to her collection. Now Vaasil has 13 orchids and 3 roses. If there are now more orchids than roses in Vaasil's collection, how many more orchids does he have?"
Response:  If Robin was originally 17 tall and has grown 5 cm taller now, then his current height is 17 + 5 = 22 cm. Now, if he grew another 30 cm, his new height would be 22 + 30 = 52 cm.
Response:  If Robin had $20 in his pocket before he lost it and now he has $10 left after losing it, then he initially had $30 ($20 + $10). So, before he lost it, he had $30 / 2 = $15.
Response:  The original height of Robin was 16 toll (tolli = 30 cm). If he grew another 12 toll, his new height would be: 16 + 12 = 28 toll (or 54 cm).
Response:  If Robin was originally 19 years old and now he is 18 years old, then his age difference with his friend has decreased by 1 year. So, if the friend is currently 20 years old, their age gap would be:  Age of Friend - Age of Robin = 20 - 18 = 2 years.
Response:  If Robin had 13 bags of flour and gave away 2 bags, then he has 13 - 2 = 11 bags left. Now if he gives away another bag, he will have 11 - 1 = 10 bags left. So after giving away two bags, Robin has 10 bags of flour left.
Response:  If Robin had 14 marbles and gave away 8 of them, he has 6 marbles left. Now if he gets 5 more marbles, he will have 11 marbles in total. So, after getting those additional 5 marbles, Robin now has 11 + 6 = 17 marbles.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 puppies and he gave 5 of them to his friend. So, now Danny has 12 - 5 = 7 puppies left. Now we are asked how many puppies Tõnu has now. Well, Tõnu got 53 puppies from Danny, so Tõnu has 53 + 7 = 60 puppies in total.
Response:  We know that there are currently 53 puppies in total and we want to find out how many puppies Danny has. So let's divide the number of puppies in total by the number of puppies Danny has: 53 / 21 = 2.56 Therefore, Danny has approximately 2.56 puppies.
Response:  We know that Danny had 63 puppies at first and gave away 51 of them. Now he has 33 puppies in his collection. So, we can calculate how many puppies Danny had initially as follows: Total number of puppies = Initial number of puppies - Number of puppies given away Total number of puppies = 63 - 51 = 12 Therefore, Danny had 12 puppies initially.
Response:  We know that Danny had 36 puppies and gave away 35 of them. Now he has 22 puppies in his collection. So, if we subtract the number of puppies he gave away from the total number of puppies he had, we get:  Number of puppies Danny has now = Total number of puppies he had - Number of puppies he gave away  In this case, the total number of puppies Danny had was 36, and he gave away 35, so:  Number of puppies Danny has now = 36 - 35 = 1  Therefore, Danny has one puppy left in his collection.
Response:  We know that initially there were 30 puppies and now there are 42 puppies in Danny's collection. So, we can calculate how many puppies Danny has gained as follows:  Gained puppies = New number of puppies - Initial number of puppies = 42 - 30 = 12 Therefore, Danny has gained 12 puppies since he started collecting them.
Response:  We know that Daniel had 22 puppies and 8 parents at first. Now he has collected 28 puppies and 63 parents in his collection. So, we can calculate how many puppies Daniel got from each parent as follows: Number of puppies = Total number of puppies / Number of parents x 100 (%) Since there are 28 puppies now, and 63 parents, we can calculate the percentage of puppies obtained from each parent as follows: Percentage of puppies = Number of puppies / Number of parents x 100 (%) Now, let's find out how many puppies Daniel got from each parent: Puppy count per parent = Total number of puppies / Number of parents x 100 (%) Now, let's put it all together to find out how many puppies Daniel got from each parent: Puppy count per parent = Total number of puppies / Number of parents x 100 (%) Now, let's convert this answer into a decimal format: Decimal representation of puppy count per parent = Puppy count per parent x 100 (%) Now, based on the given information, we can conclude that Daniel got approximately 25.79 puppies from each parent. Therefore, the answer is 25.79.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 puppies and 30 parents in the collection. Then, some of the puppies grew up to become adult dogs (parents), so now there are 17 puppies and 57 parents in the collection. To find out how many puppies Daniel had at first, we need to subtract the number of puppies he currently has from the total number of puppies he had initially. So, the answer is:  Initially, Daniel had 22 - 17 = 5 puppies.
Response:  We know that initially there were 30 puppies and 14 parents (Danny). Then, some of the puppies grew up to be adult dogs (parents), so now there are 7 puppies and 86 parents. To find out how many more puppies than parents Danny has, we need to subtract the number of puppies from the total number of animals he had originally:  $ Number \ of \ puppies = Total \ number \ of \ animals - Number \ of \ parents$  Substituting the given values, we get:  $Number \ of \ puppies = 30 - 14 = 16$  So, Danny has 16 more puppies than parents.
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 puppies and 28 bags of dog food given to Danny. Now, the total number of dogs is 68, which means that each bag contains $ \frac{68}{28} = 2.43$ times as much dog food as before. Therefore, if Danny had $ x $ bags of dog food originally, he now has $ 2.43x $ bags. Since we are asked how many more bags Danny has than he did initially, we can set up the equation: $$ \boxed{\text {Number of additional bags}} = \boxed{\text {Original number of bags}} - \boxed{\text {Initial number of dogs}} $$ Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: $$ \boxed{\text {Number of additional bags}} = 28 - (11 + 51) = 28 - 62 = -34 $$ So, Danny has $ -34 $ fewer bags of dog food than he did initially.
Response:  We know that initially there were 71 puppies and 24 parents in the collective. Now, after some time, there are 28 more puppies and 16 fewer parents. So, we have to find out how many puppies and parents Danny has now. To do this, we need to subtract the number of puppies from the total number of dogs (puppies + parents) and divide it by the number of parents. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of puppies = Total number of dogs - Number of parents = 28 + 16 = 44 Puppies Number of parents = Total number of dogs - Number of puppies = 71 - 44 = 27 Parents
Response:  We know that Daniel has 27 puppies and 43 bags of dog food in his collection. If he gives some of his puppies to someone else, then the number of puppies he has will decrease. Let's assume that for every bag of dog food he gives away, he loses 5 puppies. So if he gives away 62 bags of dog food (which is equal to 62 x 5 = 310), then he will have 9 less puppies than before, which means he will have 27 - 9 = 18 puppies left. Therefore, the number of puppies Daniel has after giving away all the dog food is 18.
Response:  We know that there are 66 puppies in total and now there are only 25 puppies left in the collection. So, we can calculate how many puppies Danny has taken as follows: Number of puppies Danny took = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies left in the collection = 66 - 25 = 41 Therefore, Danny took 41 puppies.
Response:  If there are 32 dogs in total and Danny has 25 dogs from the collection, then we need to find out how many dogs Danny does not have. We can do this by subtracting the number of dogs he has (25) from the total number of dogs (32). So, the remaining dogs that Danny does not have are: 32 - 25 = 7.
Response:  We know that Danny had 60 dogs at first and he sold 58 of them. So, now he has 2 dogs left (the ones he didn't sell). Therefore, the number of dogs Danny currently owns is 2 + 67 = 69 dogs.
Response:  We know that Danny has 6 puppies and he gave away 5 of them (leaving him with 1). Now we are told that there were initially 60 puppies in total. So, if Danny had given away all his puppies, then the number of puppies left after giving them away would be equal to the initial number of puppies minus the number of puppies he gave away. Therefore, the number of puppies left after giving them away is:  Initially, there were 60 puppies + 1 = 61 puppies.
Response:  We know that Danny has sold 54 vans of puppies and earned $48 per puppy. Now he has collected 52 puppies in his collection. To find out how much money Danny made from selling those puppies, we need to subtract the number of puppies he had before collecting them (54) from the total amount of money he earned ($48 x 52 = $2592). So, Danny made $2592 - $54 = $2538 from selling those puppies.
Response:  We know that there are 82 packings and 29 puddles in total. Now, we have 42 puddles and 61 packings in the collection. So, if we subtract the number of packings from the total number of packings, we get:  Number of remaining packings = Total number of packings - Number of packings in the collection = 82 - 61 = 21. Similarly, if we subtract the number of puddles from the total number of puddles, we get:  Number of remaining puddles = Total number of puddles - Number of puddles in the collection = 29 - 42 = -13. Therefore, Daniel had x = 21 puddles left after collecting the ones in the collection.
Response:  We know that initially there were 66 packings and 39 puppies. Now, after Daniel has taken some of them, there are 16 puppy bags and 68 packings left. So, we can calculate how many packings Daniel had at first as follows: Number of packings = Total number of packings - Number of packings left = 66 - (68 - 39) = 66 - 29 = 37 packings. Therefore, Daniel took 37 packings initially.
Response:  We know that initially there were 46 packings and 50 puppies in Danny's collection. Now, after some time, he has collected 21 more puppies and 52 additional packings. So, we have: Number of puppies = Initially 50 + Newly added 21 = 71 Packings = Initially 46 + Newly added 52 = 98 Therefore, if Danny collects more puppies than packings, then the number of puppies he collects is greater than the number of packings he collects. In this case, Danny collects 71 puppies while collecting 98 packings, so he collects more puppies than packings.
Response:  We know that initially there were 65 packings and 5 puppies in Danny's bag. Now, after some time, he has added 31 more puppy toys and taken away 9 packings. So, if we want to find out how many packings are left now, we can subtract the number of packings he took away from the initial amount:  $ Number$of$packings = Initial$number$of$packings - Number$of$packings$taken$away $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
Response:  We know that initially there were 58 puppies and 25 parents in the collective. Now we have 11 parents and 12 puppies left. If Daniel has more puppies than parents, then the number of puppies he has is greater than the number of parents he has. So, the difference between the number of puppies and parents is equal to the total number of puppies and parents at first minus the current number of parents and puppies. Therefore, the difference between the number of puppies and parents is 58 - (11 + 12) = 35. Thus, for every parent Daniel has, he has approximately 35 puppies.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 puppies and 18 bags of dog food. Now, Daniel has 67 bags of dog food and 35 puppies. If we subtract the number of puppies he had initially from the current number of bags of dog food, we get: Number of bags of dog food gained = Current number of bags of dog food - Initial number of bags of dog food = 67 - 18 = 49 bags of dog food So, Daniel gained 49 bags of dog food more than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Jake has 17 apples and wants to give some to Steven. So, if Jake gives half of his apples to Steven, how many will he have left?  Half of 17 is 8, so Jake will have 17 - 8 = 9 apples left. Therefore, Steven will get 9/2 = 4.5 apples. Since you cannot have a fraction of an apple, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 14 pears. Therefore, Jake has 7 pears less than Steven. So, Jake has 7 pears = 38 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 persimmons and Steve has 13 persimmons less than Jake. So, Jake has 18 + 13 = 31 persimmons in total. Now we are told that Steve has 19 persimmons more than Jake. Therefore, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steve has x + 19 = 30 persimmons. Finally, we are asked how many persimmons Jill has. Since Jill has 13 persimmons fewer than Steve, she has 30 - 13 = 17 persimmons. So, Jill has 17 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steve has six apples more than Jill. So, if Jill has x apples, Steve has x + 6 = 12 apples. Now we know that Jake has five apples less than Steve. So, if Steve has 12 apples, Jake has 12 - 5 = 7 apples. Therefore, Jake has seven apples fewer than Jill.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 11 more apples than Jake and Jill has 3 more apples than Steven. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake - 3 = Steven + 11
Now let's substitute the values given in the question:
Jake - 3 = 12 + 11
Solving for Jill's number of apples:
Jill = 12 + 11 = 23
Therefore, Jill has 23 apples more than Jack."
Response:  We know that Steven has 7 pears less than Jake and 9 more pears than Jill. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x - 7 pears. Also, we know that Steven has 16 fruit kits. Therefore, we can write an equation: x = 16 + (x - 7). Now, we need to find out what value of x will satisfy this equation. Solving for x, we get: x = 23. So, Jake has 23 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 7 pears fewer than Jake and 8 pears more than Jackie. So, if we subtract 7 from Jake's total of 17, we get 10. Therefore, Jackie has 10 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 16 votes and Jill has 9 votes. So, if we add up all of their votes, we get:  Steven - 16 + Jill - 9 = 7. Therefore, Steven has more than Jill by 7 votes.
Response:  We know that Steven has more apples than Jake. So if Jake has x apples, then Steven has at least x + 1 apple. Since Steven has 18 apples in total, we can write an equation: x + 1 = 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 17. Therefore, Jake has 17 apples.
Response:  We know that Steve has more apples than Jack. So if Steve has x apples, then Jack has less than x apples.  Since Jill has 87 apples, and she is between Jack and Steve in terms of number of apples, we can say that Jack has fewer apples than Jill but more apples than Steve. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples that Jack has and the number of apples that Jill has is equal to the sum of the number of apples that Steve has plus the number of apples that Jack has minus the number of apples that Jill has.  Using this formula, we get:  x - (87 + x) = 18 + (x - 87).  Solving for x, we get:  x = 65.  Therefore, Jack has 65 apples, which is less than the number of apples that Jill has but more than the number of apples that Steve has.
Response:  We know that Steven has 15 persimmons more than Jake. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 15 persimmons. Since Jill has 12 persimmons less than Steven, we can say that Jill has x - 12 persimmons. Now, to find out how many persimmons more or less Jake has than Jill, we need to subtract the number of persimmons Jill has from the number of persimmons Jake has: (x - x - 12) = -15. Therefore, Jake has 15 fewer persimmons than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer apples than Steven. So, if Steven has 79 apples and 14 oranges, then Jake must have 65 apples (79 - 12 = 65).
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 pears and 3 more than Steven. So, Jake has 13 + 3 = 16 pears in total. Now we need to find out how many ounces of apples Jake has. Since each pear is equal to 0.5 ounces, Jake has 16 x 0.5 = 8 ounces of apples. Therefore, Jake has 8 ounces of apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steve and 8 more oranges than Steve. So, if we compare their total fruit production, Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 apples less than Steve. However, he has 8 + 8 = 16 more oranges than Steve. Therefore, if we compare only the number of oranges they have, Jake has 16 more oranges than Steve.
Response:  We know that there are three apples and five oranges in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Apples = x Virsikud Oranges = 5 + y Õuna Where x is the number of apples and y is the number of oranges. Now, we know that Steven has 12 virsikud and 15 õuna. So, we can substitute these values into our equation: Apples = x Virsikud Oranges = 5 + y Õuna Substituting the value for Steven's apple count: Apples = 12 Virsikud Oranges = 5 + y Õuna Solving for y (the number of oranges): y = Oranges - Apples = 5 + 12 - x = 7 Therefore, if Steven has more than seven oranges than he has apples.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 verses and Jake has fewer than 12 verses. So, we can say that Jake has x verses where x is less than 12. Now, we are told that Jake has 4 more verses than Jill. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Jake's verses = Jill's verses + 4. Substituting the value of Jill's verses from the problem (67), we get: Jake's verses = 67 + 4 = 71 verses. So, Jake has 71 verses.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 votes and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven, which means Jake has 6 votes less than Steven. So, if we subtract 6 from Steven's vote count, we get Jill's vote count. Therefore, Jill has 12 votes.
Response:  We know that Stevenil has 19 persikuts and Jake'il has less than 19 persikuts. So, we can say that Jake'il has x persikuts where x is a positive integer less than or equal to 19. Now, we are given that Jake'il has 72 more persikuts than Jillil. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake'il = Jillil + 72. Substituting the value of Jillil from the question, we get:  Jake'il = 12 + 72 = 84. Therefore, Jake'il has 84 persikuts.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 persimmons less than Steven and 3 persimmons more than Jill. So, if we subtract 6 from Steven's total of 14, we get 8. And if we add 3 to Jill's total of 0 (since she doesn't have any persimmons), we get 3. Therefore, Jill has 3 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 13 virsikuts and 52 õuna.  If we subtract 10 persikuts from 52 õuna, we get 42 õuna. So, Jake has 42 õuna more than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 96 õuna (42 + 54).
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake had 13 apples and Steven had 17 - 17 = 10 apples, then Jake must have 13 - 10 = 3 more apples than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 3 + 8 = 11 oranges.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 persimmons and 10 ounces of honey less than Steven. So, if we subtract 10 ounces from Jake's total weight, he will have 8 persimmons and 2 ounces of honey left. Now, let's compare this to Steven. Steven has 11 ounces and 18 virsikuts (which is equal to 36 ounces). If we subtract 2 ounces from Steven's total weight, he will have 9 ounces and 34 virsikuts left. Therefore, if Jake had more honey than Steven, then Steven would have more persimmons than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has three apples and four oranges more than Steven. So, we can write an equation as follows: Apples = 3 + (Oranges - 4). Now, we know that Steven has 19 oranges and 15 vegetables. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows: Oranges = 19 - 4. Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: Apples = 3 + (19 - 4) = 3 + 15 = 18. So, Jake has 18 apples more than Steven.
Response:  If Olive spent $78 at the store and $15 at the supermarket, then we need to find out how much money she has left after these expenses. We can do this by subtracting the amount she spent from her initial budget of $100: $100 - $78 = $22. So, Olive has $22 left after buying both things.
Response:  If Oliva spends $78 at the supermarket and she has $33 left, then we can calculate how much money she had before going to the supermarket as follows:  Money before supermarket = $33 + $78 = $111 So, Olivia had $111 before going to the supermarket.
"Response: 
Olivia had $100 to spend at the store. She bought some things and spent $148. After that, she went to another store and spent even more money, which added up to $159 in total. So, if we subtract the amount she spent at the second store from the total amount she spent, we get: $159 - $148 = $11. Therefore, Olivia spent an additional $11 beyond what she originally had of $100."
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her pocket initially. She spent some money at the store and now has $49 left. If she spends even more money after leaving the store, then she will have less than $49. So, the difference between how much money she had before going to the store and how much she has left is $46 ($49 - $3). Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia spent at the store is $46."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 at first and spent $91 on a complex purchase. After that, she spent $14 more at the supermarket than she had initially. So, if we subtract the amount she spent at the supermarket from the total amount of money she had, we get: 
$53 - $14 = $39  Therefore, Olivia had $39 left after buying everything."
"Response: 
Olivia spent $106 at the store and $26 at the mall. If she spent $49 on clothes at the mall, how much did she spend in total at both places?  Total amount = Store + Mall = $106 + $26 = $132"
Response:  If Oliva spent $29 at the supermarket and she had $54 left after that, then we can calculate how much she spent in total as follows: Total amount spent = Initial amount + Amount spent at supermarket - Remaining amount After spending $29 at the supermarket, Oliva had $54 left, so the total amount she spent is: Total amount spent = $54 + $29 = $83
Response:  If Oliva spends $38 at the supermarket and she has $128 in total, then we can calculate how much money is left for her as follows: Total amount = $128 - $38 = $90 So, there are $90 left for Oliva after shopping at the supermarket.
Response:  If Dave has 19 devices connected to his phone and he wants to cut down to 5, then there are 14 extra devices that he doesn't need. So, the number of devices connected to Dave's phone is 14.
Response:  If David was 18 years old and had 5 phones, then he must have bought at least one phone when he was 13 years old (since he is now 18). So, the first phone he bought was when he was 13 + 5 = 18 years old.
Response:  If David had 10 phones and he sold 3 of them, then he had 7 phones left. After that, if he sold another 2 phones, he had 5 phones left. So, the number of phones David sold is 3 + 2 = 5.
Response:  If David had 21 mobile phone apps and he deleted 89 of them, then he had 30 remaining apps (21 - 89 = 30). So, he added 51 new apps (89 - 30 = 51) to his collection after deleting some of them.
Response:  If David had 15 phones to repair and he repaired 71 of them in total, that means he did not repair all 15 phones. So, the number of phones he did not repair is 15 - 71 = -36. Therefore, he repaired 36 fewer phones than he initially had to repair.
Response:  We know that David had 16 devices and 77 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 devices and 23 files. So, we can deduce that David deleted 11 devices (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that David had 17 devices and 21 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 3 devices and 7 files left. So, we can conclude that David deleted 14 devices (17 - 3 = 14) and 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 devices and 24 files. After some devices and files were deleted, there were 21 devices and 4 files left. If we had more devices than files, how many devices would be left after deleting some devices? So, the number of devices is greater than the number of files.
Response:  We know that initially there were 19 devices (rakendust) and 18 files (faili). After some devices and files were deleted, there were 6 devices and 15 files left. If we have more files than devices, then the number of files is greater than the number of devices. Therefore, the difference between the number of files and devices is equal to the number of files minus the number of devices. So, the answer is:  Number of files - Number of devices = 15 - 6 = 9.
Response:  If David had 17 phones and added one more, he would have 18 phones. So, the next phone he will add is number 19.
Response:  We know that after some actions and phone calls, there were 12 Rakendust and 30 Faili left. So we can write an equation: 15 - X = 12 + 30 where X is the number of rakendust that Daveil kustutas. Now we solve for X: X = 15 - 12 + 30 = 6 So Daveil kustutas 6 rakendust.
Response:  We know that after cutting down some of the phones and computers, there were 13 devices left. Then, we cut down another 5 devices, leaving 8 devices remaining. Finally, we cut down all the remaining devices, leaving none. So, the number of devices that were cut down is 8 - 13 = -5.
Response:  We know that there were initially 24 devices and 9 files. After some devices and files were deleted, there were 5 files and 12 devices left. If we had more devices than files, then the number of devices is greater than the number of files. Therefore, the answer is: More than 12.
Response:  We know that David had 11 devices and 3 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 devices. So, if we subtract the number of devices from the total number of items, we get: Number of files = Total number of items - Number of devices = 24 - 11 = 13 files. Therefore, there are 13 more files than devices after David deleted some of his devices.
Response:  We know that there are 242 cards in total.  Andris has 136 of them. So, if we subtract the number of cards Andris has from the total number of cards, we get: 242 - 136 = 106. Therefore, the number of cards left with Nell is 106.
Response:  If Nell had 301 cards in her hand at first (omake), then she must have received 154 more cards since then (tal 154). So, the total number of cards Nell has now is: 301 + 154 = 455 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards initially, and she gave 11 of them to Jeff. Now, we have 252 cards left with her. So, the number of cards Jeff has is equal to the number of cards Nell had minus the number of cards she gave to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of cards Jeff has = 528 - 11 = 517
Response:  We know that Jeff has 234 cards at first. Then, he gives some of his cards to Nell, who now has 566 cards in total (including Jeff's). So, the number of cards Jeff has left is 535 - 234 = 301. Therefore, Jeff currently has 301 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 309 Pesapalli cards and 356 10-card packs in total. Then, some of these cards were taken away from Jeffie, leaving him with 415 Pesapalli cards and 149 10-card packs. Now, if Nell has more than 10 cards, then she must have at least 209 additional Pesapalli cards (since 309 - 10 = 209). Therefore, the number of Pesapalli cards Nell has is 415 + 209 = 624.
Response:  We know that there are 246 Pesapalli cards and 214 10-card packs in total. Now, we have 404 Pesapalli cards and 495 10-card packs altogether. So, if we subtract the number of Pesapalli cards from the total number of 10-card packs, we get: Number of 10-card packs = Total number of 10-card packs - Number of Pesapalli cards  Number of 10-card packs = 495 - 246 = 249  Therefore, there are 249 more 10-card packs than Pesapalli cards.
Response:  We know that there were initially 573 cards in total. Then, 195 of them belonged to John, and some others (not necessarily Jeff) had 145 more cards. Now, there are 210 additional cards altogether. So, the number of cards belonging to Jeff is:  Number of cards belonging to Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards belonging to John = 210 - 195 = 15.
Response:  We know that there are 438 Pesapalli cards and 18 10-card sets. Now, some of these cards belong to Jeffie, and now he has 55 10-card sets and 178 Pesapalli cards altogether. If Nell has more than 10 cards, then she must have at least 126 Pesapalli cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 239 ten-kaarts and 38 one-ten kaarts in total. Then, Jeff took some of his cards away, leaving him with 376 ten-kaarts and 111 pesapalli kaarts. Now, if Nell has more than 10-kaarts than pesapalli kaarts, then...
Response:  If Paco has 19 cups and leaves 35 cups, then he must have taken 35 - 19 = 16 cups. Therefore, the number of cups that Paco took is 16.
Response:  If Paco has 28 cups and he gives some to his friend, then he will have less than 28 cups left.  We know that after giving 7 cups away, he is left with 7 cups. So, we can conclude that Paco had 21 cups before giving any away (28 - 7 = 21). Therefore, the number of cups Paco originally had was 21.
Response:  If Paco has 40 apples and he gives away 2 to his friend, then he still has 38 apples left. So, if he already had 40 apples before giving any away, that means he gave away 2 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Paco had after giving them away is 40 - 2 = 38.
Response:  If Paco has 25 cookies and he wants to share them equally among 4 people, each person will get 6 cookies (25/4 = 6). Now, if we add 1 more cookie for each of these 4 people, they will have 7 cookies in total (6 + 1 = 7). So, there are 7 more cookies than before. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  If Paco has 13 cups and he gives two to his friend, then he will have 13 - 2 = 11 cups left. So, if Paco buys x cups of coffee, he will have 11 + x cups in total.
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 marbles in total. If he gives away 5 marbles to someone else, then he will have 35 marbles left (40 - 5 = 35). Now we are told that Paco still has 13 of his original marbles, so the number of marbles he has now is 35 + 13 = 48. Therefore, Paco has 48 marbles left after giving away 5 marbles.
Response:  We know that Paco has 17 marbles in total.  Andris has 14 marbles. So, if Paco gives some of his marbles to Andris, then Andris will have more than he had before. Specifically, Andris gets 13 more marbles from Paco. Therefore, the number of marbles Andris now has is: 14 + 13 = 27.
Response:  If Paco has 12 cups and he gives 4 to his friend, then Paco has 12 - 4 = 8 cups left.  If now his friend gives him back 2 cups, then Paco has 8 + 2 = 10 cups. So, if Paco had more cups than his friend in the beginning, he will have even more after the exchange. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We know that Paco has 22 magazines and 75 solids in his bag. If he gives 15 magazines to someone else, then he will have 22 - 15 = 7 magazines left. Similarly, if he gives 54 solids to someone else, then he will have 75 - 54 = 21 solids left. So, the number of magazines Paco still has is 7, and the number of solids he still has is 21. Therefore, the answer to the question is 7 + 21 = 28.
Response:  We know that Paco has 9 groups of 6 cards each, which means he has 9 x 6 = 54 cards in total. Then we are told that he also has 36 more cards, which is not part of any group. So, the number of cards Paco still has left after giving away all his groups is 54 - 36 = 18. Therefore, Paco still has 18 cards left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 37 magicians and 11 soloists. If we add up all of their numbers, we get 48. Now, let's see how many more magicians than soloists there are in total. There are 5 more magicians than soloists. So, if there were x magicians and y soloists, then x - y = 5. Solving for y, we find that y = 9. Therefore, there are 9 soloists in addition to Paco's 37 magicians.
Response:  We know that Paco has 8 maguses and 6 soloists. If he had 20 more maguses than soloists, then he would have 20 + 6 = 26 maguses. But we also know that he has 34 more soloists than maguses, which means he has 34 - 6 = 28 soloists. So, if Paco has more soloists than maguses, then there are more soloists than maguses.
Response:  If Paco had 36 cups at first and then got 3 more cups, he would have 39 cups in total (36 + 3 = 39). So, if Paco already had 39 cups and then received 4 more cups, he would have 43 cups in total (39 + 4 = 43). Therefore, the correct answer is 43.
Response:  Paco has 36 cookies in total. He gave away 14 of them to his friend. So, he still has 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22). Now, he shared 10 more cookies with someone else, so he has 12 cookies left (22 - 10 = 12). Therefore, Paco still has 12 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 41 marbles in total. Of those, he gave 9 to his friend. So, Paco has 32 marbles left (41 - 9 = 32). Now we are asked how many marbles Paco's friend has. Since Paco gave 9 marbles to his friend, his friend must have 9 + 9 = 18 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  If Paco has 30 cups of water in his bucket and he gives 23 cups to someone else, then he will have 7 cups left (30 - 23 = 7). So, if more cups were given away, less would be left for him.
Response:  We know that Paco had 97 pairs of shoes and 34 pairs of sandals. So in total he had 97 + 34 = 131 pairs of footwear. Now we are asked how many more pairs of shoes Paco has than Magus. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pairs of shoes Magus has from the total number of pairs of footwear Paco has. Therefore, the difference between the two is: 131 - 15 = 116 pairs of shoes. So, Paco has 116 more pairs of shoes than Magus.
Response:  We know that Paco has 26 solos and 17 magic shows. So, he already had 26 + 17 = 43 performances. Now we are asked how many more solos does Paco have than magic shows. To find this difference, subtract the number of magic shows from the total number of performances: 43 - 17 = 26. Therefore, Paco still has 26 solos left to perform after doing 17 magic shows.
Response:  We know that Paco has 39 magusats and 6 soloists playing instruments. If he has 23 soloists playing instruments and 32 musicians playing instruments, then we can calculate how many more musicians are playing instruments than soloists as follows: Number of musicians = Total number of musicians - Number of soloists = 32 - 6 = 26 Therefore, there are 26 more musicians playing instruments than soloists.
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 magazines and 25 solids in his bag. If he adds 28 more solids than magazines to his bag, then... (solve)
Response:  Gwen said she spent $7 dollars. If she had more money left after spending that amount, then she must have had $5 dollars left initially. So, the amount of money she spent is $7 - $5 = $2.
Response:  Gwen got $10 dollars. She spent half of it which is $6. So now she has $4 left. Tal gave her another $8 dollars. Now Gwen has $12 dollars in total.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen gave $2 to her mother. Then, Isa spent even more than that, which is $4. If they had spent $3 together, then there would be $1 left over. So, the total amount of money they spent is $5 ($2 + $4).
Response:  If Gwen has $8, Isa has $5, and you spend $4. Then, if you have more money than Gwen, you will have $8 - $4 = $4 more than her. So, the answer is $4.
Response:  If Gwen gave $3 to her mom, then Isa had $6 (3 + 3). If Isa spent $4 of it, then she has $2 left ($6 - $4 = $2). So, if Gwen can buy more things than her mom with the same amount of money, then Gwen has $2 more than her mom.
Response:  If Gwen has $5, Emma has $7, and they spend $4 together, then their total amount of money left after spending is:  $5 + $7 - $4 = $9 So, if Gwen had more money than Emma initially.
Response:  If Gwen has $5, Emma has twice that amount, or $10. If they spend $6 together, then Gwen will have less money than Emma because she spent more. So, if Gwen has x dollars, then Emma has 2x dollars. Therefore, Gwen has less money than Emma.
Response:  If there were originally 9 blocks and some of them broke into pieces (kogus), then now there are less than 9 blocks. We don't know exactly how many fewer because we don't have that information in the question. So, the number of remaining blocks is between 1 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, there must be at least 3 blocks left, since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 is greater than or equal to 9.
Response:  If Joshil had 21 cows and gave 12 of them to his friend, then he has how many cows left? So, the number of cows that Joshil has left is 21 - 12 = 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Joshil had 19 cows and he sold 11 of them. So, now he has 8 cows left with him (19 - 11 = 8).
Response:  According to the question, Joshil heard 4 sounds (kogus), and he could distinguish between them. He correctly identified 16 of these sounds as different from each other, while he was able to identify only 8 new sounds that he had not heard before. Therefore, the number of sounds that Joshil could hear more than twice is:  $ \boxed{16} $
Response:  If Joshil heard 7 words and understood 8 of them, he would have understood 1 word more than he heard. So, if he heard 10 words, he would understand 3 words (10 - 7 = 3).
Response:  The last time Joshil saw his grandmother was 21 days ago. He heard 7 times that she had passed away. So, currently, it has been 21 - 7 = 14 days since her death.
Response:  We know that Joshil had 20 cows. Now he has 2 more cows (Jackie). So, the total number of cows Joshil now has is 2 + 20 = 22 cows.
Response:  Joshil had 22 cows, and Jack had 20 cows. Now, we need to find out how many cows Joshil has now. So, if Joshil had 22 cows before and he lost 2 cows, then he has 20 cows left. Therefore, Joshil currently has 20 cows.
Response:  If there were originally 11 cows and now 3 more have been added, then the total number of cows is: 11 + 3 = 14 cows.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Joshil had 22 cows and he sold 13 of them. So, now he has 9 cows left with him (22 - 13 = 9). Now, let's find out how many calves he has. According to the question, he has 5 calves. Therefore, the total number of animals Joshil has now is 9 + 5 = 14.
Response:  We know that Joshil has heard 15 words and counted 9 marbles and dropped 23. So, we can calculate how many more marbles Joshil dropped than he heard as follows:  Number of marbles dropped = Total number of marbles + Number of marbles dropped = 9 + 23 = 32 Therefore, Joshil dropped 32 marbles more than he heard.
Response:  If Joshil has 3 eyes and can see 6 objects, then he can count 6 x 3 = 18 objects in total. However, if he is able to distinguish between 5 and 6 objects, then he cannot see all of them at once, so his maximum number of visible objects is 5. Therefore, the difference between what Joshil sees (5) and what he can count (18) is 13.
Response:  Marco has 5 marbles in his pocket and he wants to give some of them away to his friends. He has 3 friends who want to receive an equal number of marbles from him. How many marbles will each friend get if they all have an equal share?  Each friend will get 1/3 of the total number of marbles that Marco has, which is 5 x 3 = 15 marbles. So, each friend will get 15 marbles.
Response:  Marco has 35 marbles and he gives 13 of them to his friend. So, if we subtract the number of marbles that Marco gave away from the total number of marbles he had, we get... (calculation)...which means that Marco has 22 marbles left after giving some to his friend.
Response:  We know that Marco has 5 ice cream cones and he wants to share them equally among his friends. If there are 4 of his friends, each friend will get 5/4 = 1 ice cream cone from Marco. Now we need to find out how many ice cream cones Marco gave away in total. He gave 17 ice cream cones away, so the number of ice cream cones Marco kept for himself is: 5 - 17 = -12 ice cream cones. Therefore, Marco had -12 ice cream cones.
Response:  If Marco has 10 ice cream cones and he gives one to his friend, then Marco has 9 ice cream cones left.  If Marco's friend also has 32 ice cream cones, then together they have 41 ice cream cones (Marco has 9 + his friend has 32). So, if more people join them with their own ice cream cones, the total number of ice cream cones will increase accordingly.
"Response: 
Marco had 10 marbles initially and gave away 4 to his friend. So he has 6 marbles left. Then, he got 3 more marbles as a gift from someone else. Therefore, the total number of marbles that Marco now has is 6 + 3 = 9 marbles."
Response:  Marco had 36 marbles at first and gave 8 to his friend. Now he has 12 marbles left. To find out how many marbles Marco's friend got, we can divide the total number of marbles Marco had (36) by the number of marbles he gave away (8). So, Marco's friend got 4 marbles (36 / 8 = 4).
Response:  Firstly, Marco had 15 more marbles than Isa. So, if Isa had x marbles, then Marco had 15 + x marbles. Now, we know that Marco gave 30 marbles to his friend. Therefore, the number of marbles he had before giving them away was 30 - (x + 15). Now, we are told that after giving the marbles away, Marco had 36 marbles left. So, we can set up an equation using these values: 30 - (x + 15) = 36. Solving for x, we get: x = 22. Therefore, Isa had 22 marbles initially and Marco had 15 more than that, which means he had 37 marbles initially.
Response:  We know that there are 15 marbles in one bag and 37 bags of marbles total. So, if we want to find out how many marbles Marco has altogether, we can multiply the number of marbles per bag by the number of bags he has:  Number of marbles = Number of marbles per bag x Number of bags = 15 x 37 = 525 marbles
Response:  We have three marbles in total (Marco has 2 and Isa has 1). If Marco's marbles are bigger than Isa's, then Marco has 30 marbles and Isa has 17 marbles. Now, if we add up all of Marco's marbles, including his own 2 plus the 3 he took from Isa, we get 35 marbles. Therefore, there are more marbles in total now than when Isa had them alone, so the correct answer is 35.
Response:  We have 3 marco and they are building a house together. Each of them has to pay $10 for every brick they use. If they use 26 bricks in total, how many dollars will each of them have to pay?
Response:  Marco has 11 marbles and he wants to share them equally among his friends. If each friend gets 30 marbles, then how many marbles will Marco have left? So, the number of marbles that Marco has after sharing with his friends is 11 - (30 x 4) = 11 - 120 = -9. Therefore, Marco has -9 marbles left.
Response:  If there were initially two children in the bus and now there are ten more children than before, then at first, there were five children in the bus (2 + 5 = 7). Now, if we add the number of additional children to this total, we get 12 (7 + 5 = 12) children in the bus altogether. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  If there were 26 passengers in one bus and each bus can carry up to 38 passengers, then we need to find out how many buses are needed to accommodate all the passengers. We know that 26 / 38 = 0.69 or approximately 1/1.5 buses are needed to transport all the passengers. Therefore, there would be about 1/1.5 or 0.67 buses for every 38 passengers.
Response:  We know that there were 41 children on the bus before it stopped. If the bus had more than two stops before reaching its destination, then we can assume that some of the children got off at each stop. So let's call the number of children who got off at each stop x. Then, after the first stop, there were 41 - x children left on the bus. After the second stop, there were 41 - (x + 1) children left on the bus, and so on. Since there were only two stops in total, we can set up the following equation: 41 = x + (x + 1) +... + (x + n), where n is the number of stops. Solving for x, we get x = 35. Therefore, there were 35 children who got off the bus at each of the two stops.
Response:  We know that there are 43 bus stops in total and they have been running for 21 hours. So, we can calculate the number of children who passed through each stop as follows: Number of children per hour = Total number of children / Time taken to run (in hours) Now, let's find out how many times each child passed through each bus stop: Number of times a child passed through each bus stop = Total number of children / Number of hours the bus ran Therefore, if a child passes through every 5 minutes, then he/she will pass through each bus stop 10 times in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, if there were 43 bus stops, then the child would pass through each stop 43 x 10 = 430 times in 21 hours.
Response:  We know that there were 41 children in the bus and they all got off at once. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who were already on the bus when it left (18). Therefore, the number of additional children who got off the bus is equal to 23 (41 - 18).
"Response:  If there were 21 passengers in one bus and each bus can carry up to 16 passengers, then we have:

Number of buses = Total number of passengers / Maximum capacity per bus
= 21 / 16
= 1.31 (approximately)
So, approximately 1.31 buses are needed to transport all the passengers if they are distributed evenly among multiple buses."
Response:  If there were 63 students in one bus and they all fit equally well as 14 students per row, then we can calculate how many buses are needed to transport all the students. So, if more than 50 students want to go to school, it will be necessary to use additional buses.
Response:  If there were initially 36 children in the bus and some of them got off, then there were 68 children left on the bus. Now let's calculate how many children are left if 12 more get on the bus than those who got off. So, the number of children who got on the bus is 12 more than the number of children who got off. Therefore, the final number of children on the bus is 68 + 12 = 80.
Response:  The first bus had 22 passengers and the second bus had 40 passengers, so in total there were 62 passengers. If we subtract the number of children from the total number of passengers, we get 58 adult passengers. Therefore, there were 58 adult passengers on both buses combined.
Response:  If there were initially 28 children and 82 more came to board the bus later, then the total number of children who rode the bus is 110 (28 + 82). Now let's calculate how many children could fit in the bus if each child took up an average space of 0.5 square meters (as mentioned in the question): Total area = Number of children x Area per child = 110 x 0.5 m² = 55 m². Since the bus had a capacity of 30 children, we can see that it was overcrowded by 25 children (55 - 30 = 25).
Response:  If there were 23 people in the bus and 2 more got on, then there are now 25 people in the bus (including the driver). So, if 8 children get off the bus, then there will be 17 people left on the bus (including the driver).
Response:  If Baker has 51 cookies and each cookie weighs 133 grams, then...
"Response:  If there are 54 cookies in total and 13 of them belong to Baker, then we can calculate how many cookies Baker has as follows:

Total number of cookies = 54
Number of cookies belonging to Baker = 13

So, Baker has 13/54 = 0.24 or approximately 1/4 of all the cookies."
Response:  We have 145 eggs and we want to know how many eggs Baker got. If there are more than 72 cooked eggs, then Baker got x eggs. So, the number of eggs Baker got is x = 145 / 72 = 2.
Response:  If Peakokk has 155 cookies and he sold them for $140, then we can calculate how many cookies Baker illegally bought as follows:  Number of cookies sold = Total amount of money earned x Price per cookie  In this case, number of cookies sold = $140 x $1 = 140 cookies So, Baker illegally bought 140 - 155 = -15 cookies more than Peakokk.
Response:  We know that the total number of cookies is equal to the sum of the original cookies and the new cookies. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Cookies = Original Cookies + New Cookies Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Cookies = 121 + 105 = 226 Therefore, there are 226 cookies in total. As for how many more cookies Baker has than Peak, we can subtract the value of Peak's new cookies from the total number of cookies: Number More Cookies = Total Cookies - Peak's New Cookies = 226 - 170 = 56 So, Baker has 56 more cookies than Peak.
Response:  The total number of cookies that Peakokk and Müüs baked is 13 + 91 = 104 cookies.  Since Baker bought more than Müüs, let's assume Baker bought x cookies more than Müüs. So, the total number of cookies Baker bought is 104 + x = 154 cookies. Therefore, Baker bought 50 additional cookies (x) compared to Müüs.
"Response: 
Tootja (initial amount) = 170 cookies.
Miu (amount after buying) = 78 + 31 = 109 cookies.
So, Baker bought more cookies than he had initially. The difference between the initial and final amounts is 109 - 170 = -51 cookies. Therefore, Baker has fewer cookies now than he had at first."
Response:  We have to find out how many cookies are in total and then divide them into equal parts for each person. So, we know that there are 110 cookies in total. If we want to give 75 cookies to one person, it means that there will be 35 cookies left over after giving them away (110 - 75 = 35). Now, if we want to give 76 cookies to another person, it means that there will be only 24 cookies left over after giving them away (35 - 76 = -21). Therefore, if you give more than 76 cookies to someone, they will get fewer cookies than Baker did.
Response:  We know that peakokk has 144 cookies and müüs has 71 cookies. So if we add both amounts together, we get 215 cookies. Now, let's see how many more cookies Baker has than müüs. To find this out, we subtract the amount of cookies müüs has from the total number of cookies. Therefore, Baker has 111 cookies more than müüs.
Response:  If we take away 10 cookies from 149 cookies and give 90 cookies to Baker, then there are 59 cookies left for Baker (149 - 10 = 59).
Response:  We know that 7 + 148 = 155 and 103 - 15 = 88. So, if Baker had 15 cookies and gave 103 to someone else, then he would have 88 cookies left.
Response:  We know that peakokk (peaks) are equal to 126 cookies and 48 bags. If we have 115 cookies and 81 bags, then we can calculate how many more or fewer peaks there are compared to Baker. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bags from the total number of cookies. So, if we have 115 cookies and 81 bags, then the difference between the two is: 115 - 81 = 34. Therefore, there are 34 more peaks than Baker has.
Response:  We have two sets of measurements given in the question:  •	Paari has measured 19 large eggs and 131 small eggs.  •	Kooke has measured 70 large eggs and 88 small eggs. To find out how many more small eggs Kooke has than Paari, we need to subtract the number of small eggs that Paari has from the number of small eggs that Kooke has:  Number of small eggs that Kooke has - Number of small eggs that Paari has = 131 - 19 = 112 Therefore, Kooke has 112 more small eggs than Paari.
Response:  If Paari has 157 cookies and gives 169 to Baker, then Paari had 157 - 169 = -13 cookis left.  If Paari had -13 cookis left and gave some to Baker, then Paari had -13 + x cookis left where x is the number of cookies given to Baker. Therefore, if Paari gave 158 cookies to Baker, then Paari had -13 - 158 = -171 cookis left. Similarly, if Paari gave 147 cookies to Baker, then Paari had -13 - 147 = -160 cookis left. So, the difference between the number of cookies Paari had before giving any to Baker and the number of cookies Paari had after giving some to Baker is equal to the number of cookies given to Baker minus 13.
Response:  If we have 54 cookies and 143 cookies in total (peakock), then if we add more cookies to that amount, let's say 68 cookies, it will be equal to 54 + 68 = 122 cookies. Now, if we add even more cookies, let's say 92 cookies, it will be equal to 122 + 92 = 214 cookies. So, the answer is 214 cookies.
Response:  If Parija had 44 cookies and gave half of them to Baker, then she would have given him 22 cookies (half of 44). So now, Baker has 22 + 26 = 48 cookies in total. Therefore, there are 4 more cookies with Baker than with Parija.
Response:  If Parija had 8 cookies and gave 4 to Baker, then she has 8 - 4 = 4 cookies left.  Now, if Baker took more than his share (which is 2/3 of what Parija has), he would take 2/3 x 4 = 2 cookies from Parija. So, now Parija has 4 - 2 = 2 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paiguri has eaten 137 cookies and wants to eat more until he has eaten as many as Bakeril, who has already eaten 169 cookies. So, we need to find out how many cookies Paiguri needs to eat to catch up with Bakeril. To do this, we can divide the number of cookies that Bakeril has eaten (169) by the number of cookies that Paiguri has eaten so far (137): Number of cookies needed for Paiguri = 169 - 137 = 32 Cookies Therefore, Paiguri needs to eat 32 more cookies to catch up with Bakeril.
Response:  We know that total number of cookies is equal to sum of small and medium size cookies. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Cookies = Small Size Cookies + Medium Size Cookies Now, we are given that there are 173 large size cookies. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the above equation as follows: Total Number of Cookies = 103 + 86 + 173 = 462 cookies. So, there are 462 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that Peakokk got 99 cookies and gave away 167 cookies. So he has 89 cookies left. Now we need to find out how many more cookies Baker got than Peakokk. To do this, we can subtract the number of cookies Peakokk had from the total number of cookies given away. Therefore, the difference between the two is: 89 - 99 = -10. So Baker got 10 more cookies than Peakokk.
Response:  We know that Peakokk bought 8 large boxes of cookies and Ostis bought 139 small boxes of cookies. So, we can calculate the total number of cookies that Peakokk bought as follows:  Number of large boxes = 8 Large boxes x Number of cookies per box = 8 x 20 = 160 Cookies Now, let's find out how many more cookies Baker has than Peakokk: Difference between Baker's and Peakokk's cookie count = Total number of cookies owned by Baker - Total number of cookies owned by Peakokk = 145 - 160 = -15 Cookies Therefore, Baker has fewer cookies than Peakokk.
Response:  We know that there are 62 cookies in one bag and we want to find out how many bags it takes to have 149 cookies altogether. So, we can divide 149 by 62 to get the number of bags needed: $ \frac{149}{62} = 2$ bags. Therefore, there will be 2 bags of cookies if you buy 149 cookies. Now, let's calculate how much each bag contains: $ \text {Number of cookies in one bag } = \frac{\text {Total number of cookies}}{\text {Number of bags}} = \frac{149}{2} = 74.5$ cookies per bag. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cookie, we round up the number to the nearest whole number, which is 75 cookies per bag. So, there will be 75 cookies in each bag if you buy 149 cookies.
Response:  We know that Tootja has 81 cookies and wants to give more than 92 cookies. So he needs to take some from his own stash. If he takes 46 cookies from his stash, then Baker will have more than him (92 - 46 = 46). Therefore, Baker will have 46 more cookies than Tootja.
Response:  We know that the total number of cookies is 61 + 167 = 228 cookies. If Bakery A has 108 cookies and Bakery B has 44 bags with 5 cookies each, then the total number of cookies from Bakery B is 44 x 5 = 220 cookies. Therefore, there are 228 - 220 = 8 more cookies from Bakery B than from Bakery A.
Response:  We know that peakokk has 56 pages and 124 cookies. If we take away 104 cookies from him, he will have 29 pages left. So, if many pages of books belong to Bakeril too, then the number of pages belonging to Bakeril is equal to the number of pages left with Peakokk minus the number of pages taken away from Peakokk. Therefore, the number of pages belonging to Bakeril is 29 - 104 = -75 pages.
Response:  If Pete can make 52 pancakes in 84 minutes, then he can make one pancake in 0.67 minutes (52/84).  If he makes 102 pancakes and takes 94 minutes to do so, then he can make one pancake in 0.99 minutes (102/94). So, if Pete makes more than 102 pancakes, he will take less time per pancake compared to when he made fewer pancakes.
Response:  If we have 134 cookies and 11 cookies in total (peak), then if we add more cookies to make it 140 cookies, we will have 140 - 134 = 6 additional cookies. Similarly, if we add more cookies to make it 112 cookies, we will have 112 - 11 = 101 additional cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies that Baker has is 101 + 6 = 107 cookies.
Response:  If peakokt is 14 and 153, then we have a total of 167 kooki. Now if we take away 8 kooki from that amount, we get 160 kooki. And if we add 97 kooki to that remaining amount, we get 257 kooki. So the correct answer is 257 kooki.
Response:  If Paari has 43 cookies and wants to share them equally among 114 people, each person will get 0.36 cookies (43/114). Now, if Baker gives out more cookies than he had (154-78=76), then each of the additional 76 people will get 0.97 cookies (76/80). So, in total, each person will get approximately 1.33 cookies (0.36+0.97).
"Response:  If we have 22 Nintendo games and want to know how many more are needed for 140 games in total, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of games needed = Total number of games / Number of games currently owned
= 140 / 22
= 6.36 (round up to nearest whole number)
Therefore, if you own 22 Nintendo games, you need 6-7 more games to reach 140 games in total."
"Response:  If we have 106 Nintendo games and want to know how many more would be needed for each player to have 64 games, we can divide 106 by 64. So, we need:

106 / 64 = 1.67

So, approximately 1.67 times as many games are needed for each player to have 64 games."
Response:  If there are 91 Nintendo games and we add 1 more game, then there will be 92 games in total. So, the correct answer is 92.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly has altogether, we need to add the number of Nintendo games she has to herself (Kelly + Kelly's Nintendo Games =...). So, Kelly's total number of games is equal to 20 + 12 = 32 games.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. If we want to find out how many Sony games Kelly has altogether, we can simply add up all of her Sony game count: 46 + 132 = 178. So, Kelly has 178 Sony games in total.
Response:  We know that there are 80 Nintendo games in total. If we take away 31 of them, then we have left with 49 games. Now, if we want to find out how many more or less than 6 games there are, we can subtract 6 from 49, which gives us 43. So, there are 43 more Nintendo games than 6 games.
Response:  We have to find out how many quarters were used in total for building the tower and then divide it by the number of quarters that are left after we subtract the number of quarters used to build the foundation. So, let's calculate first how many quarters were used for building the tower: 52 - 38 = 14 quarters. Therefore, there are 14 quarters remaining after building the tower.
"Response:  If there are 97 quarterly payments and we want to build a tower that takes 72 quarterly payments to complete, then we can calculate how many quarters it will take to build the tower as follows:
Quarterly Payments = Total Amount / Number of Quarters
= $100,000 / 72
= $1366.88 per quarter
Therefore, it will take 72 quarterly payments or approximately 5 years and 4 months to build the tower based on the given information."
Response:  Randyl has built 79 quarter-buildings and used 14 for tower construction and 11 for villa construction. So, there are more than 60 extra quarters left over (79 - 14 - 11 = 64).
"Response:  We know that Randyl has 58 quarters to build two structures - a tower and a house. Since we need 27 quarters for building the tower and 53 quarters for building the house, we can conclude that:

Number of quarters needed for building the tower = 27
Number of quarters needed for building the house = 53
Therefore, the number of quarters used for building both structures is: 27 + 53 = 80 quarters."
Response:  We know that Randyl has used 33 quarterly installments for tower construction and 13 quarterly installments for house construction. So we can calculate the total number of quarterly installments used for each project as follows: Tower Construction: Total Number of Quarterly Installments = 33 x 4 = 132 House Construction: Total Number of Quarterly Installments = 13 x 4 = 52 Therefore, Randyl has spent more money on tower construction than on house construction. The difference in the number of quarterly installments is 80 (132 - 52).
Response:  We know that Randyl has 86 quarterly payments to make for his house construction and 79 quarterly payments for his tower construction. To find out how much he spends more on house construction than tower construction, we need to calculate the difference between these two amounts. So, let's subtract 79 from 86:  $86 - 79 = 9$. Therefore, Randyl spends $9 more on house construction than on tower construction per quarter.
Response:  If Randy has built 36 quarters in total and he has 59 quarters left to build, then we can calculate how many quarters he has already built as follows: Total number of quarters = Number of quarters built + Number of quarters left to build -1 (since we subtracted one quarter from the total) Total number of quarters = 36 + 59 - 1 = 94 quarters So, there are 94 quarters that Randy has already built.
Response:  We know that Randyl has $100,000 to spend on either building a house or a tower. If he spends $20,000 on building a house, then he will have $80,000 left over for the tower. So, if he builds a tower with $50,000, he will have $30,000 left over ($80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000). Therefore, Randyl will use more money to build the tower than he would to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randyl has used 89 quarterly payments for building his house and 63 quarterly payments for building his tower. To find out how much he spent more on building his house than on building his tower, we need to subtract the number of quarterly payments used for the tower from the total number of quarterly payments used for both buildings. Therefore, the difference between $89 \times 4 = 352$ and $63 \times 4 = 252$ is equal to $100$. So, Randyl spent $100$ more on building his house than on building his tower.
Response:  We are given that there are 20 erinevat raamatut (books) and we need to find out how many of them have been read more than 5 times. So, let's count the number of books that have been read more than 5 times:  Book 1 - Read 6 times Book 2 - Read 7 times Book 3 - Read 4 times Book 4 - Read 8 times Book 5 - Read 9 times Book 6 - Read 10 times Book 7 - Read 11 times Book 8 - Read 12 times Book 9 - Read 13 times Book 10 - Read 14 times Book 11 - Read 15 times Book 12 - Read 16 times Book 13 - Read 17 times Book 14 - Read 18 times Book 15 - Read 19 times Book 16 - Read 20 times Book 17 - Not read at all Book 18 - Not read at all Book 19 - Not read at all Book 20 - Not read at all Therefore, there are 17 books that have been read more than 5 times.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the Bible and we want to find out how many books are left after reading 8 of them. So, if we read 8 books from the Bible, then we have 13 - 8 = 5 books remaining. Therefore, there are 5 books left in the series called ""Hullute ja lollete kooli""."
Response:  We know that if you have watched 12 movies and want to watch more, then the number of movies you can watch is equal to 56 - 12 = 44. So, you can watch 44 more movies.
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies to choose from. If you have read all 19 books and watched all 7 movies, then you still have 4 books left to read and 10 movies left to watch. Therefore, the number of movies you can watch is 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Hullu ja Lollu Kooli"". If we had read 19 books and watched 13 films, then we would have more than twice as many books as films. Therefore, the number of books is greater than 2 times 16 = 32. So, the answer is 32 or more."
Response:  We know that there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the series. If we have watched 19 books and want to know how many more movies there are than books, we can subtract the number of books from 10: 10 - 19 = 2. So, there are 2 more movies than books in the series.
"Response:  If you have read 10 books and watched 11 movies from the series ""Hull Türa Kooli"", that means you have consumed a total of 10 + 11 = 21 pieces of media. Therefore, if you had to choose between reading more books or watching more movies from the same series, you would choose to watch more movies because you already have read 10 books."
"Response:  If you have read 11 books and watched 17 movies from the series ""Hull Türa Kooli"", then you have a total of 28 items (books + movies). To find out how many more movies you would need to watch than books you have read, we can subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of items: 28 - 11 = 17. So, if you want to have as many movies as books you have read, you would need to watch 17 more movies."
"Response:  We have 8 books with titles that start with ""Hullutest"". If we assume each book has an average length of 20 pages (just for simplicity), then we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Page count = Number of books x Average page count per book = 8 x 20 = 160 pages Now, let's consider the series ""Hull Türa Kooli"" which consists of 14 books. Again assuming an average length of 20 pages per book, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Page count = Number of books x Average page count per book = 14 x 20 = 280 pages Therefore, there are 280 pages in the entire series ""Hull Türa Kooli""."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different Bible verses in the series ""Hull Türa Kooli"". If you have watched 4 Bible verses and want to watch 34 more, then we can calculate how many Bible verses you still need to watch as follows: Number of remaining Bible verses = Total number of Bible verses - Number of already watched Bible verses = 19 - 4 = 15 So, you still need to watch 15 more Bible verses from the series ""Hull Türa Kooli""."
Response:  We know that there are 8 different films and 21 different books. If we have watched 7 movies and read 4 books, then we still have to watch 3 more movies (8 - 7 = 3) and read 18 more books (21 - 4 = 18). So, the number of movies left to watch is 3, and the number of books left to read is 18.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 films in the series ""Hull Türa Kooli"" and 15 books in the series ""Erinevat Raamat"". If we have watched 11 books and want to watch more than 40 films, then we can conclude that we have watched more films than books. Therefore, the number of films is greater than the number of books. So, the answer is: More than 40 films."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films in the ""Hullu Lollipop"" series and 11 books in the ""Hull Türa Kooli"" series. If we have watched 13 of the movies and read 63 books, then we have more books than movies. Therefore, the number of books is greater than the number of movies. So, the answer is: Books > Movies"
"Response:  If you have watched 10 movies and read 6 books from the series ""Hullumeelne Rumal Kool"", then you have spent in total 10 + 6 = 16 hours. Therefore, if you had watched more than 14 movies and read more than 19 books, you would have spent more time doing that activity."
"Response:  We know that we have to compare the number of movies (8) and books (16). So, if we had watched more movies than read books, it would be:

Movies watched - Books read = More movies than books

So, in this case, the difference between the number of movies and books is:

8 - 16 = -8

Therefore, we can say that we have watched fewer movies than we have read books."
Response:  If Dave has 7 apples and he wants to share them equally among 4 friends, each friend will get 1 apple.  Now if there are more than 4 friends, let's say 6 friends, then Dave will have to give 2 apples to each of the additional 2 friends, so in total he will give 6 + 6 = 12 apples away.
Response:  If Dave has 12 pieces of candy and he wants to buy more, then he needs 2 more pieces (since he already has 12). So, if there are more than 14 pieces of candy in total, then Dave can buy all of them except for the additional 2 that he needs. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Dave can buy is 14 - 2 = 12.
Response:  If Dave has 18 piles of clothes and he uses 5 pieces for washing and 11 pieces for ironing, then we need to calculate how many pieces are left after these operations. We know that 5 + 11 = 16, so there will be 16 pieces of clothes left after washing and ironing. Therefore, Dave had more than 18 piles of clothes before these operations (18 - 16 = 2).
Response:  If Dave has 19 piles of clothes and he uses 12 pieces for each pile (which is equal to 19 x 12 = 228 pieces), then he will have used all his clothes if he has more than 228 pieces in total. Therefore, we can say that Dave uses more clothes from the big box than from the small box if he has more than 228 pieces in total after using both boxes. So, the answer is yes, Dave uses more clothes from the big box than from the small box.
Response:  If Dave uses 8 bicycles for transportation and more than 18 times for recreational purposes, then he uses more bicycles for recreational purposes than for transportation. Therefore, the number of bicycles used for recreational purposes is greater than 8.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 pairs and lost 2 pairs, then he has 16 games left (14 - 2 = 16). Now, if he uses 10 game pieces to buy something, that means he will have 6 remaining games (16 - 10 = 6). So, there are 6 more games left after buying something.
Response:  If Haley has grown 14 bags of potatoes in her garden after 9 days of rain, and she can grow more than that if it rains more, how much will she be able to grow? So, let's assume that for every additional day of rain, she is able to grow an extra bag of potatoes (since she grows more when it rains). Therefore, if it rains for x days, she will be able to grow x bags of potatoes. Since we know that x = 9 (the number of days of rain), we can plug this value into the equation and solve for the total amount of potatoes Haley will be able to grow: Total amount of potatoes = Number of days of rain x Extra bags of potatoes per day = 9 x 14 = 126 bags of potatoes So, Haley will be able to grow 126 bags of potatoes if it rains for 9 days.
Response:  If Haley had 13 apples and gave away 6 as gifts, how many apples would she have left after the storm?  We know that more than 5 apples were destroyed in the storm. So, if Haley had x apples before the storm, then she has x - 5 apples now. Therefore, the number of apples Haley has now is 8 (x - 5).
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 apples and after the storm, she had 4 left. So, if we divide the number of apples she had before the storm (20) by the number of apples she had after the storm (4), we get the ratio of how many apples were lost during the storm: 20/4 = 5. Therefore, 5 apples were lost during the storm.
Response:  After the hurricane (Tagahoovis) killed 5 people, there were 12 survivors left. If we want to know how many people can be born in total, we need to multiply the number of survivors by the birth rate per woman. According to World Bank data, the average birth rate per woman in Estonia is 1.43 children per woman. Therefore, if 12 people survived and each woman gave birth to an average of 1.43 children, then the total number of people who could be born would be: 12 x 1.43 = 17.08 people. So, approximately 17 people could be born in this scenario.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Haley has 9 puud of corn after the tornado destroyed 4 acres of her field. So, she will have more corn than before. To find out how much more, we need to subtract the area of land destroyed from the total area of land she had earlier. Therefore, if 4 acres were destroyed and she had 10 acres in total, then she will have 6 acres left (10 - 4 = 6). Now, let's calculate the number of puud of corn she will have after deducting the area of land destroyed from the initial amount. We can do this by dividing the initial amount of corn (9 puud) by the remaining area of land (6 acres). Thus, Haley will have 5 puud of corn per acre (9 / 6 = 5). Since there are 4 surma (or sections) of land, she will have a total of 20 puud of corn (5 x 4 = 20).
Response:  If Haley has collected 12 bags of sand and each bag contains 5 kg of sand, then the total weight of all the sand is 12 x 5 = 60 kg.
Response:  If the typhoon had grown to 13 units of Haley's scale after being 3 units initially, and it grew more than twice as much as needed for each unit, how many units would it have grown to in total? So, if the typhoon grows 2 times faster than needed for each unit (i.e., $ \frac{d}{dt} = 2\times \text{needed} $), then it will grow to $\boxed{\text{13}\times 2 = 26}$ units in total.
Response:  If Haley had 11 apples and gave half of them to her friend, how many apples did she have left after giving them away? She would have 5 apples left (half of 11). Now let's assume that the storm destroyed twice as many apples as Haley had left. So if she had 5 apples left, the storm destroyed 10 apples (twice 5).
Response:  If they have to peel 66 oranges and each orange has 28 segments, then...
Response:  We have to divide 24 into 8 parts. So we need to find out how many parts of 3 each will be. Therefore, we can write: 24 / 8 = 3. So there are 3 parts of 24 for every 8 parts of oranges.
Response:  If it takes 4 days to peel an orange and each orange has 56 segments, then...
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are in one bunch and then calculate how many bunches there are after 49 days of ripening. So, let's start with finding out how many apples are in one bunch. According to the question, each bunch contains 38 apples. Now, we need to find out how many bunches there are after 49 days of ripening. To do this, we can divide the total number of apples (which is 42) by the number of apples in one bunch (which is 38). This gives us the number of bunches after 49 days of ripening: $ \frac{42}{38} = 1.13$ bunches. Therefore, after 49 days of ripening, there will be approximately 1.13 bunches of apples.
Response:  We know that there are 66 apples in total and each apple takes 25 days to grow after planting. So, if we want to find out how many days will pass until all the apples are grown, we can use this information. Therefore, the number of days it will take for all the apples to be grown is: 87 - 66 = 21 days.
Response:  We know that there are 8 apples in total and each apple is divided into 35 pieces. So, we can calculate the number of pieces of each apple as follows: Number of pieces = Total number of apples / Number of apples per piece = 8 / 35 = 0.236 (approximately). Therefore, approximately 0.236 apples are needed to fill one potato.
"Response:  We have to divide the total number of oranges (160) by the number of orange peels (57). So we get: 

Number of orange peels = Total number of oranges / Number of orange peels per orange
= 160 / 57
= 2.74

So, it takes approximately 2 and 3/4 orange peels to remove one orange. Now let's calculate how many orange peels are needed to remove 80 oranges: 

Number of orange peels needed = Total number of oranges / Number of orange peels required for one orange
= 80 / 2.74
= 29.3

Therefore, you would need approximately 29 orange peels to remove 80 oranges."
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 67 apples are taken from the basket and then we will know how many apples are left in total. So, if 67 apples are taken from the basket, there will be 67 - 67 = 0 apples left in the basket. Now, let's calculate how many apples are left in total. If there were initially 12 apples in the basket and now there are no apples left in the basket, then the total number of apples is 0 + 12 = 12. Therefore, if 35 apples are added to the basket, then the new total number of apples will be 12 + 35 = 47 apples.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 74 days and then calculate how many apples were left before they started corroding. So, we need to subtract the number of days that passed since they started corroding from the total number of days. Therefore, the number of apples left after 74 days is: 74 - 51 = 23 apples.
Response:  If we have 76 apples and want to divide them equally among 64 people, each person will get 1 apple. So, if there are 50 apples in total, then each of the remaining 16 apples will be divided into 2 parts (since there are 16 more apples than people). Therefore, each person will get 1/3 of an apple.
"Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 26 days of corruption and then divide them into two groups based on their size. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Apples left after 26 days = Total number of apples x (1 - Corruption rate) / Number of days
= 280 koti x (1 - 0.26) / 26
= 280 koti x 0.74 / 26
= 193 koti

So, there are approximately 193 apples left after 26 days of corruption."
Response:  We have to find out how many apples were left after 25 days and then calculate how many apples were eaten in total.  So, we can start with the information given in the question:  The number of apples that were left after 25 days is: 82 - (61 + 25) = 36 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples eaten during the experiment is: 61 + 25 = 86 apples.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 45 days of corruption.  If 31 apples were rotten in 45 days and 24 apples were still good, then we can calculate the number of apples that will be rotten after 45 days as follows:  Number of apples that will be rotten = Total number of apples x Rate of rotting (%) / Time taken for rotting (days)  In this case, the total number of apples is 55 (31 + 24), and the rate of rotting is 0.6 (since 31/55 = 0.6). Therefore, the number of apples that will be rotten after 45 days is: Number of apples that will be rotten = 55 x 0.6 / 45 = 17 So, there will be 17 apples that will be rotten after 45 days.
"Response:  If they have collected 44 apples and want to know how many more apples they need to collect to equal the number of apples that are spoiled (25), we can calculate it as follows:

Number of apples needed = Number of spoiled apples / Ratio of total apples to spoiled apples
= 25 / (44 + 25)
= 25 / 69
= 0.367 or approximately 37%
So, if they have collected 44 apples, they still need to collect around 63% more apples (or 37% more than the total number of apples collected) to make up for the spoiled ones."
Response:  If we have 5 apples that are not spoiled and need to be eaten immediately, and 74 apples that are already spoiled and cannot be eaten, then...
Response:  If they took 54 oranges to clean and they cleaned 18 of them in one day, then...
Response:  If they peeled 56 oranges in one day and then took 14 days to peel them all, how many days did it take them in total?
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are left after 73 days of corruption.  If we start with 100 apples and 25 of them are rotten in 73 days, then there will be 75 apples left (100 - 25 = 75).  And if 5 of those remaining apples are also rotten, then there will be 70 apples left (75 - 5 = 70). So, after 73 days, there will be 70 apples left.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples were corrupted in total and then divide it by 6 to get the number of days passed since they were corrupted.  Total number of apples = 105 (65 + 46) Number of days passed = Total number of apples / 6 = 105/6 = 17.5 days So, 17.5 days have passed since the apples were corrupted.
Response:  If we have 41 apples that are not spoiled and need to be eaten immediately, and 86 apples that are already spoiled and cannot be eaten, then we can conclude that there are more apples that need to be eaten than those that are already spoiled. Therefore, if we want to eat as many apples as possible, it is better to eat the non-spoiled ones first. So, the correct answer is: More apples need to be eaten than are already spoiled.
Response:  If we have 71 apples that are not corrupted and 60 apples that are partially corrupted, then in total we have 71 + 60 = 131 apples. Now, if we want to know how many more apples there are that need to be corrupted for the total number of corrupted apples to equal the total number of non-corrupted apples, we can set up an equation based on this information: Number of corrupted apples = Total number of corrupted apples / Total number of non-corrupted apples x 100 = 131 / (71 + 60) x 100 = 58% So, approximately 58% of the apples need to be corrupted for the total number of corrupted apples to equal the total number of non-corrupted apples.
Response:  We know that there are 12 jalgas (pikes) and 11 jalgas (reeds). So, we have to find out how many more reeds than pike...
Response:  Firstly, we have 7 jalga pikk (7 x 3 = 21). Then, if we take 14 ruutmeetri suurust vaipet (14 x 4 = 56), and divide it by 21, we get the result of 2.66. So, the answer is 2.66.
Response:  We know that there are 7 jalgas (steps) in total and each jalg has 14 units of length. So, we can calculate the total length of all 7 steps as follows: Length = Number of units x Length per unit = 14 x 0.5 = 7 meters Therefore, the length of one step is 7 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three meetrit (or points) in total. Therefore, if we divide the number of points by the number of rows (which is 16), we get: $ \frac{3}{16} = \frac{1}{5} $. So, there are five meetrit per row.
Response:  We have two quantities - 8 and 12. If we divide 8 by 3 (since there are 3 parts to each measure), we get 2 with remainder 0. So, 2 measures of rice will fit in one measure of potatoes.
Response:  We have 6 meetrit (measures) of 4 beats each, so in total we have 6 x 4 = 24 beats. If there are 20 tubas, then for every 5 tubas, one beat will be left over. Therefore, after all 20 tubas play their measures, there will be 20 x 5 = 100 beats remaining.
Response:  If there are 6 meetrit (meetings) in total and 3 of them lasted for 1 hour each, then we have: Total time = Number of meetings x Time per meeting = 6 x 1 = 6 hours. Now, if some of these meetings were shorter than an hour, let's say they lasted for 30 minutes each, then we have: Total time = Number of meetings x Time per meeting = 6 x 0.5 = 3 hours. So, the difference between the total time of longer meetings and shorter ones is 3 - 6 = -3 hours. Therefore, the answer to the question is -3 hours.
Response:  If Jesse has 10 meters of rope and each meter is 0.1 meters long (which means there are 10 meters in 1 metre), then we can calculate how much rope Jesse has as follows:  So, if Jesse has 10 meters of rope, that means he has 10 x 0.1 = 1 meter of rope altogether. Therefore, Jesse's body length is 1 meter.
Response:  If Jesse has 10 small balls with him and he throws them all at once, they will cover an area of $ \frac{10}{2} = 5$ square meters.  But if he throws one ball at a time, then each ball will cover an area of $\frac{1}{2}$ square meter. So in total, Jesse will throw $10$ balls, which means that the area covered by all the balls is $10\times \frac{1}{2} = 5$ square meters again. Therefore, the size of one ball is $\frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}$ square meter.
Response:  We have 18 days in July and we want to know how many hours there are between 4 am and 10 pm.  There are 24 hours in a day, so we can calculate as follows:  Number of hours = Total number of minutes / 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)  Therefore, the number of hours between 4 am and 10 pm is:  Number of hours = 18 x 60 / 24 = 720 hours
Response:  We know that the total cost of all the T-shirts is $230 and there are 5 people in Arkansas who bought them. So, each person paid an average price of $\$56$. Now we need to find out how many T-shirts each person bought. Since Texas Tech had 17 people buying T-shirts, they paid an average price of $\$48$. Therefore, the number of T-shirts each person from Texas Tech bought is $\frac{48}{17}$. Similarly, for Arkansas, the number of T-shirts each person bought is $\frac{56}{5}$. Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{\text {2}} \times \boxed{\text {48}}$ = $\boxed{\text {96}}$.
Response:  We know that there are three T-shirts in total and they cost $20 each. So, the total cost of all three T-shirts is $60 (3 x $20). Now we need to find out how much money each person has left after buying the T-shirts. Let's assume that there are five people in total - Arkansas, Texas Tech, and three other people. Each person spent $60 / 5 = $12 on T-shirts. Therefore, each person has $60 - $12 = $48 left after buying the T-shirts.
Response:  We know that the total cost of all 87 razors is $87. If we subtract the cost of the 47 razors from Arkansas, we get $40. So, the difference in price between the two teams is $40.
Response:  We know that there are 106 dollars in total and we want to find out how many dollars each team has.  Arkansas has $115 and Texas Tech has $242. So, if you divide $242 by $115, you get 2.  Therefore, Texas Tech has twice as much money as Arkansas.
Response:  We know that there are 98 dollars in total and we want to find out how much each team got. So let's divide the total amount of money by the number of teams: $ 98 / 2 = $ 49 per team. Now we need to calculate how many T-shirts each team received based on the price per team: $ 49 x 163 = $ 7,547 for Arkansas and $ 49 x 89 = $ 4,091 for Texas Tech. Therefore, Arkansas received $ 7,547 worth of T-shirts and Texas Tech received $ 4,091 worth of T-shirts.
Response:  We know that in total there are 186 T-shirts between both teams (Arkansas and Texas Tech). If Arkansas has 172 T-shirts, then how many does Texas Tech have? To find out, we can divide the total number of T-shirts by the number of T-shirts Arkansas has: 186 / 172 = 10.5. So, Texas Tech has approximately 10.5 times as many T-shirts as Arkansas.
Response:  We know that in total there are 183 T-shirts and 31 hoodies sold. The price of each T-shirt is $20, and the price of each hoodie is $40. So, we can calculate the total amount of money earned as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price of hoodie In this case, the total number of T-shirts sold is 183, so the total amount of money earned from T-shirts is: Total amount of money earned from T-shirts = 183 x $20 = $3,660 And the total number of hoodies sold is 31, so the total amount of money earned from hoodies is: Total amount of money earned from hoodies = 31 x $40 = $1,240 Therefore, the total amount of money earned is: Total amount of money earned = $3,660 + $1,240 = $4,900
Response:  The cost of one razorback ticket is $67 and that of a Red Raider ticket is $165. Therefore, if an individual buys tickets for both games, they will have to pay a total amount of money as follows: For the Arkansas game, they will have to pay $67 x 2 = $134, and for the Texas Tech game, they will have to pay $165 x 2 = $330. So, in total, they will have to pay $134 + $330 = $464.
Response:  We know that there are 192 dollars in total and 34 of them belong to Arkansas. So, we have $192 / 34 = $5.88 per dollar for Arkansas. Now, let's calculate how much each team got from Texas Tech. Since they gave away 157 T-shirts and received 19 shirts, we can calculate the amount of money each team got as follows: Texas Tech gave away $157 x 19 = $2,863, and Arkansas got $2,863 / 34 = $85. So, the final answer is $85 + $85 = $170.
Response:  We know that in Arkansas, there are 86 dollars for every 100 dollars spent at IGA, and in Texas, there are 232 dollars for every 100 dollars spent at Walmart. So if we spend $100 at IGA in Arkansas, we will get $86 back in value. Similarly, if we spend $100 at Walmart in Texas, we will get $232 back in value. Now let's calculate how much more money we can make by spending more than $100 at either store. If we spend $200 at IGA in Arkansas, we will get $172 back in value ($86 x 2 = $172). If we spend $200 at Walmart in Texas, we will get $464 back in value ($232 x 2 = $464). Therefore, if we have to choose between spending our money at either store, it is better to spend more than $100 at Walmart in Texas because we will get more value back in return.
Response:  We know that Arkansas and Texas Tech spent $8 each to buy one T-shirt, so they together spent $8 + $8 = $16. Now we need to find out how many T-shirts they bought in total. According to the question, Arkansas and Texas Tech bought 130 T-shirts altogether. So, if they spent $16 on each of those shirts, then the total amount of money they spent on all 130 shirts is $16 x 130 = $2,040. Therefore, the answer is $2,040.
Response:  We know that there are 5 teams in total - Arkansas and Texas Tech have each spent $217 dollars for 14 tickets, so their total spending is $217 x 2 = $434. Now we need to find out how much money is left after they spend it. So, let's subtract the amount they spent from the initial amount of money available, which was $200. Therefore, the remaining amount of money is $200 - $434 = -$234.
Response:  If Arkansas and Texas Tech spend $60 each for T-shirts, then they will have $60 - $40 = $20 left over after buying T-shirts for 10 people. So if they buy more than 10 T-shirts, they will have even less money left over.
Response:  We know that Arkansas and Texas Tech have agreed to play five games at $215 per game. If they want to play more than five games, we need to find out how much each additional game will cost them. So, if they want to play six games, it will cost them $215 x 6 = $1,290. Similarly, if they want to play seven games, it will cost them $215 x 7 = $1,595, and so on. Therefore, the maximum amount they can pay for playing more than five games is $1,595 (seven games) or $1,290 (six games).
Response:  We know that Arkansas has $5 dollars and Texas Tech has $215 dollars. If we divide the amount of money Arkansas has by the number of T-shirts they have (20), we get $2.50 per T-shirt. Similarly, if we divide the amount of money Texas Tech has by the number of T-shirts they have (64), we also get $2.50 per T-shirt. Therefore, the answer is $2.50.
"Response:  We know that in Arkansas, there are 76 dollars for every 100 rubles and in Texas Tech, there are 204 dollars for every 100 rubles. So if we convert these amounts to rubles, we get: In Arkansas, $76 / $100 = 0.76 rubles per dollar; In Texas Tech, $204 / $100 = 2.04 rubles per dollar. Now let's calculate how much money each person has: In Arkansas, Person A has $76 / 0.76 = 100 rubles; In Texas Tech, Person B has $204 / 2.04 = 99 rubles. Therefore, the difference between their amounts is: $100 - $99 = $1. So the correct answer is $1."
Response:  We know that $210 is greater than $240, so we can start with that information.  If Arkansas has 177 T-shirts and Texas Tech has 23 shirts, then together they have a total of 190 shirts (177 + 23 = 190).  Since there are more T-shirts than S-shirts, we can say that the total value of all the shirts is greater than $240.  Therefore, the answer is $240 or more.
Response:  If we have $115 for buying razors and $25 for buying T-shirts, then in total we have $140. Now let's calculate how many razors and T-shirts we can buy with this money. To do that, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of each item. For razors, we get $140 / $115 = 1.23 (we can buy 1.23 times more razors than T-shirts). For T-shirts, we get $140 / $25 = 5.6 (we can buy 5.6 times more T-shirts than razors). So if we had to choose between buying more razors or more T-shirts, we would choose more T-shirts because they are cheaper per unit.
Response:  If there are 5 large complexes and each complex has 10 tools, then the total number of tools is 5 x 10 = 50. So, there are more than 50 tools than large complexes.
"Response:  If there are two complex numbers with real parts $a$ and $b$, then we can write them as $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$, where $ad-bc=1$. Now, if the sum of these two complex numbers is $12$, then we have:
$$\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = 12 \Rightarrow ad - bc = 12$$
Now, let's solve for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$:
$$a = 12d \Rightarrow b = 12c$$
So, the number of real solutions is $4$."
Response:  If there are n tags in total and each tag has 3 holes, then the number of holes is 3n. Since there are 9 tags, the total number of holes is 3(9) = 27. Therefore, one compound has 27 holes.
Response:  If there are 11 large and 5 small bags of rice, then the total number of bags is 11 + 5 = 16. So, the number of bags that Neil has is 16 / 2 = 8. Therefore, Neil has 8 bags of rice.
Response:  We have 10 complements and each complement has 6 tools. If 11 people are using tools, then how many tools will be free? So, there will be 5 free tools (10 - 11 = 5).
Response:  We know that there are 12 boys and 14 girls in total. So, if we divide the number of boys by the number of girls, we get 12/14 = 0.857 (approximately). Therefore, Neil has 85.7% of his friends as girls.
Response:  If there are 4 large complexes and each complex has 3 tools, then the total number of tools is 4 x 3 = 12. Since 14 people will come, they can buy at most 12 tools. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  If there are 14 tools in total and each tool has at least one component (a handle), then we can assume that there are more than 9 components in total. Therefore, if there are 9 complete sets of tools, it means that there must be more than 9 tools in total. So, the correct answer is: More than 9.
Response:  If Kui Lewis earned $460 last week and he works every day, then his daily earnings are: $460 / 7 = $65 per day.
Response:  If Lewis earned $16 per day last year and he worked for 30 days in July, then his total earnings from working in July would be: $16 x 30 = $480. So, if we subtract the amount of money he spent ($1216 - $480), then we get the remaining amount of money that Lewis saved : $736.
Response:  If Lewis has $21 in his pocket and he spends $70 on something, then he will have $9 left over. So, if he spends more than $70, he won't have any money left.
Response:  If Kui has $1357 now and he wants to save for 223 days, then he needs to save $60 per day. So, if he works for 73 weeks (which is equal to 223 days), he will have saved $4291 ($60 x 73 weeks).
Response:  If Lewis has $28 left after buying 10 items worth $10 each and he spent $939 for all those items, then we can calculate how much money he had before buying them as follows:  Money Lewis had before buying = Total amount of money he spent - Amount he spent on each item x Number of items he bought = $939 - $10 x 10 = $279 So, Lewis had $279 before buying any items.
"Response:  If Lewis has $403 left after spending $233 last month and he wants to know how much he can spend this month if he has $49 extra, we need to calculate it as follows:

$403 - $233 = $170 (amount of money Lewis had left after spending $233 last month)
$170 + $49 = $219 (maximum amount of money Lewis can spend this month)"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has $368 in his wallet and he wants to spend at most $388 for dinner. If he spends more than $388, then he will have less money left over after dinner. So, we need to find out how much he can spend without going over $388. To do this, we divide $388 by 100, which gives us $38. Therefore, Lewis can spend up to $38 without exceeding his budget of $388.
Response:  If Lewis has $491 in his wallet and he spends $118 for dinner, then he will have $373 left ($491 - $118). Now if he wants to buy something that costs $216 more than what he has left, he can do so because he has enough money left after buying dinner. So, the answer is yes, he can afford it.
Response:  We know that in 19 years, $100 will be worth $133. So if we multiply $100 by 19, we get $1900. Therefore, if we add $19 to $133, we get $152.
Response:  If Lewis has $200 and he spends $178 in one day, then he will have $200 - $178 = $22 left after one day. So, if he continues to spend at this rate for 3 days, he will have spent a total of $22 + $22 + $22 = $66. Therefore, after 3 days, he will have $200 - $66 = $134 left.
Response:  We know that there are 10 cord lengths of rope and they are all equal in length (Dean's korg). So if we have x amount of water, then the volume of water is equal to the volume of one cord multiplied by the number of cords. Therefore, V = x/10. Now we need to find out how much water there is.
Response:  We know that there are two large Deans and one small Dean. The big Dean has 8 gallons of water. If the small Dean had 14 gallons of water, how much water did the big Dean have?
Response:  We know that there are 5 cord lengths of Ron's hair. If Dean cuts 3 meters off each cord, how many cords will he have left? So if Ron has 12 jalgs (which is equal to 40 cm) of hair, and we subtract the length of his remaining cords, we get...
Response:  We know that Dean is 15 meters tall and has a shoulder width of 4 meters. If we assume that Ron is also as wide as his shoulders are tall (which seems reasonable), then he must be at least 4 x 15 = 60 meters away from Dean. But since he is only 3 meters tall, he can't possibly be that far away! So the correct answer is 60 - 3 = 57 meters.
Response:  We know that there are 16 cord lengths of Ron's hair. If Dean is 9 heads tall, then Dean's height is $ \text{9} \times \text{cord length} = 9\text{ cord lengths} $.  Since Ron's hair is 4 meters long when he is not combing it, and each cord length is $\text{0.5 m}$, we have: $$ \boxed{\text{Ron's hair length}} = \boxed{\text{4 m}} \div \boxed{\text{9 cords}} = \boxed{\text{0.44 m}} $$ So, if Ron was to comb his hair, his hair would be $\boxed{\text{0.44 m}}$ longer than its original length.
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 years old and Dean is 6 years older than Ron, so Dean is 21 years old. Therefore, we can conclude that the difference between their ages is 6 - 15 = -9 years. Since they are brothers, their age difference must be positive, so the correct answer is +9 years.
Response:  If there are 34 pages in total and each page has two sides (front and back), then we have to count how many pages contain information. So, if one side of each page contains information, then we have $ \frac {34}{2} = 17$ pages with information.
Response:  If there are 42 books and each book contains 2 pages, then the total number of pages is: 42 x 2 = 84 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 27 books in Brain's library and he has read every book twice, so he has read each book 2 x 27 = 54 times. Now we need to find out how many times Brain has read all the books together. Since there are 23 books that Brain has read more than once, we can subtract this number from the total number of times Brain has read all the books to get the number of times he has read them only once. So, the answer is 54 - 23 = 31 times.
Response:  If there are 9 books in Brain's library and each book has 46 pages, then the total number of pages in all the books is equal to 9 x 46 = 404 pages. So, if Brain reads one page every day, he will have read 404 pages after one day.
Response:  We know that there are 23 books in Brain's library and each book contains 29 pages. So, the total number of pages in all 23 books is 23 x 29 = 577 pages. Now we need to find out how many copies of each book Brain has. If he has 61 copies of each book, then the total number of copies of all 23 books is 61 x 23 = 1403 copies. Therefore, the total number of pages in all the copies of Brain's library is 1403 x 577 = 813,930 pages.
Response:  If there are 7 books in total and each book has the same number of pages, then we can say that the number of pages in one book is equal to the number of books divided by 7. So if there are 28 books, then the number of pages in each book is 28 / 7 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 pages in each book.
Response:  If Brian has 4 themes and each theme contains 2 books, then Brian has in total 4 x 2 = 8 books.  Therefore, if there are 38 books in total, then Brian has 38 / 8 = 4.5 books.
Response:  If we buy one package of chocolate that contains 20 pieces and each piece costs $1, then the total cost would be $20. Now let's assume we want to buy more packages but not necessarily in multiples of 5. So if we buy two packages, the total cost would be $40 (2 x $20). If we buy three packages, the total cost would be $60 ($30 + $30), and so on. Therefore, the answer is $60.
Response:  We know that Carol has 12 small suitcases and she bought 3 packages of equal value. So, we can assume that each package is worth $4 (since it takes 3 packages to make up $12). Therefore, the value of one package is $4.
Response:  If Carol bought 10 bags of apples and gave away 3 bags, then she has 7 bags left. So, if she gives away more than one bag at a time, how many bags will she have left after giving away all the extra bags? Therefore, the answer is 4 bags.
Response:  If Oma bought 6 packages of chocolates and each package contains 14 pieces, then she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 pieces of chocolate. Now, if she gave some away to her friends, let's say she gave away half of them (which is equal to 42 pieces), then she has left with 84 - 42 = 42 pieces of chocolate. So, the number of pieces of chocolate that Oma can give away is 42.
Response:  If Oma has 3 grandchildren and she bought 2 packages of candy for each child, then how many packages of candy did she buy in total?  So, if she wants to give 9 candies to her grandchildren, and she already has 2 packages, then she needs to buy additional 7 packages of candy (9 - 2 = 7).
Response:  If Melissa got 12 points from Igor, and if she got 36 points in total, then we can calculate how many points Igor gave her as follows:  Points given by Igor = Total points received by Melissa - Points received from Igor = 36 - 12 = 24 points. Therefore, Igor gave Melissa 24 points.
Response:  We know that Melissa has three bags with weights of 45 kg, 60 kg, and 75 kg. If we add these weights together, we get 180 kg. So, if each bag contains the same amount of weight as there are bags (3), then each bag must contain 60 kg.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in the first test and got 82 bonus points for the second test. So, her total score is 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now we need to find out how many points she scored in the third test. According to the question, she scored 79 points in the third test. Therefore, the final answer is 191 - 79 = 112 points.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in one subject and she got 7 points in another subject, then the difference between their scores is 21 - 7 = 14 points. So, if we want to find out how many points Melissa scored in the second subject, we can divide the difference by 2, which gives us 14 / 2 = 7 points. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in the second subject.
Response:  We know that Melissa got 91 points in total and she has 13 items to sell. If each item costs $10, then the total cost of all her items is $13 x 13 = $163. So, if we subtract the cost from the total score, we get $91 - $163 = -$72. Therefore, Melissa lost $72.
Response:  If there are four large rats and each can eat 5 kilograms of food per day, then how much food will they need to eat altogether?  We know that there are 20 people who want to eat at the same time as the rats, so we have to calculate how many kilograms of food they will need to eat.  Therefore, the total amount of food needed for all these creatures is: 4 large rats x 5 kg/day = 20 kg/day + 20 people x 1 kg/person/day = 20 kg/day.
Response:  If there are 9 people and they can eat at most 3 times per day, then the total number of meals that can be eaten is 9 x 3 = 27. So, if 18 people can eat at the same time as these 9 people, then the total number of meals that can be eaten is 27 / 18 = 1.5. Therefore, there will be 1.5 extra meals for each person.
Response:  We have to divide 19 into smaller parts and then multiply it with 20. So we will get 380 as our final answer (19 x 20 = 380).
Response:  We have 18 obstacles and 15 people. If 10 of them can move at the same time, then how many people will be able to pass through the obstacle course simultaneously?
Response:  If there are 6 big rats and each rat has 14 mice, then the total number of mice will be 6 x 14 = 84. But if there are more than 16 rats, then the total number of mice will also increase accordingly. So, the correct answer is 84 or more.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people can fit inside each of the two big roller coasters. According to the question, one of them can accommodate 23 large and 14 small cars, which means that it has a total capacity of 37 cars (23 + 14). Similarly, the other roller coaster can hold 54 large and 0 small cars, so its total capacity is also 54 cars. Now, let's calculate the number of people who can ride each car. We know that there are 6 people in each large car and 4 people in each small car. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride each roller coaster is equal to the number of cars multiplied by the number of people per car. For the first roller coaster, this means that it can accommodate 37 x 6 = 222 people, while for the second roller coaster, it means that it can accommodate 54 x 6 = 324 people. Finally, we need to subtract the number of people who rode the smaller roller coaster from the total number of people who could have ridden both roller coasters to get the number of people who rode the bigger one. In this case, 222 - 324 = -102 people, which means that more than half of the possible riders chose to go on the bigger roller coaster instead of the smaller one.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many people can fit inside each small and large capsule. For the small capsules, there are 4 of them, and each one can hold 8 people, so the total number of people who can fit inside them is 4 x 8 = 32. For the large capsules, there are 3 of them, and each one can hold 12 people, so the total number of people who can fit inside them is 3 x 12 = 36. Now, let's calculate the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once. Since there are 3 small capsules and 3 large capsules, the total number of people who can ride it simultaneously is 32 + 36 = 68. Therefore, if more than 68 people want to ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, they will not be able to do so.
Response:  If there are 4 seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and it takes 20 minutes to complete one rotation, then the total time for all cars to make one full rotation will be: Time = Number of cars x Time per car x Number of rotations Total time = 4 x 20 x 1 = 80 minutes Now, let's calculate how many people can fit inside the Ferris wheel at once: People = Total time / Time per person Total time = 80 minutes People = 80/20 = 4 So, there can be 4 people in each car of the Ferris wheel at any given time.
Response:  If there are four people and each person can go around the Ferris wheel twice, then how many times will all together go around the Ferris wheel? So, the total number of times they will go around is 4 x 2 = 8.
Response:  If there are 7 pits and each pit contains the same amount of honey (hulk), then if there are 14 pits in total, how much honey is in all the pits together?
Response:  If there are two cups and one cup contains 28 spoons, then how many spoons do I have in total?
Response:  If there are 17 pits and each pit contains 3 eggs, then the total number of eggs is 17 x 3 = 51. So if there are 25 eggs in total, that means there are 25 - 51 = -26 eggs more than expected.
Response:  If I have 9 apples and give one to my friend, then I will have 8 apples left. If I have 2 friends, how many apples will each of them get if we divide equally?
Response:  We know that Oma and Ema have together collected 10 bags of sand. If one bag contains 45 liters of sand, then we can calculate how many bags Oma has collected as follows:  Oma's collection = Total collection / Number of bags = 10 / 2 = 5 bags. Therefore, Oma has collected 5 bags of sand.
Response:  Oma has 45 eggs and gives one to Ema. Now there are 44 eggs left. Lilli wants to divide them equally among Istvan, Juri, and Liili. How many eggs will each of them get if they have an equal number of eggs?  Therefore, Istvan gets 44/3 = 14 eggs, Juri gets 44/2 = 22 eggs, and Liili gets 44/4 = 11 eggs.
Response:  We know that Paige has 36 friends and she invited only her mother and father to her birthday party. So, we can say that the number of people who attended the party is equal to the number of people who were not invited. Therefore, the number of people who did not attend the party is 36 - (mother + father) = 36 - 2 = 34. Since Lily had 58 candles on her cake, we can conclude that Lily was 34 years old at the time of the party.
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom together have 55 seemnet (pieces) of clothing to share between them. They each get 15 pieces for themselves, leaving 60 pieces left over after they are divided equally among both of them. So, in total, Paige and her mom have 60/2 = 30 pieces of clothing. Therefore, Paige has 30 - 15 = 15 pieces of clothing.
Response:  If Oma and Ema have 10 apples each and they gave 60 seems of candy to Lili, then we can calculate how many candies Lili got as follows:  Number of apples Oma has = 10  Number of apples Ema has = 10  Total number of apples both Oma and Ema have = 20  Since they gave 60 seems of candy to Lili, let's divide the total number of apples by the number of seems of candy given to Lili:  Number of seems of candy Lili got = Total number of apples / Number of seems of candy given to Lili  Number of seems of candy Lili got = 20 / 60 = 1/3 or 0.33  So, Lili got 0.33 (or one third) of an apple from Oma and Ema.
Response:  If Oma has 6 grandchildren and each of them has 8 great-grandchildren, then in total there are 6 x 8 = 48 great-great-grandchildren. However, if some of these great-great-grandchildren have already passed away, leaving behind only 32 living descendants, then we can calculate the number of generations that have passed since Oma was born as follows: Number of generations = Total number of descendants - Living descendants Total number of descendants = 48 Great-great-grandchildren - 32 Living descendants = 16 Generations Since Oma was born. Therefore, 16 generations have passed since Oma was born.
Response:  If Matthew has 11 pieces of candy and gives 2 to his friend, then he will have 9 pieces of candy left. Now if he gives another piece to another friend, he will have 8 pieces of candy left. So in total, Matthew gave away 2 + 1 = 3 pieces of candy. Therefore, he now has 9 - 3 = 6 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Matthew has 6 Krakkers and he gives 2 to his friend, then he will have 4 Krakkers left. But if he then gives 1 more Krakker to another friend, he will have 3 Krakkers left. Therefore, the final number of Krakkers that Matthew will have is 3.
Response:  If Matthew has 15 crackers and gives away 5 of them to his friend, he will have 10 remaining crackers left. Now, if he wants to know how many crackers he will have after giving away more than 5 but less than 10, we can use the following calculation: Number of crackers after giving away x = Total number of crackers - Number of crackers given away (x) So in this case, the total number of crackers is 15, and Matthew gave away 5, so the number of crackers he will have after giving away more than 5 but less than 10 is: Number of crackers after giving away x = 15 - 5 = 10 Therefore, Matthew will have 10 crackers left after giving away more than 5 but less than 10.
Response:  If Matthew has 24 crackers and he gives 3 to his friend, then he will have 24 - 3 = 21 crackers left. Since there were originally 17 crackers in total, Matthew gave away 3 + 1 = 4 crackers. Therefore, Matthew has 21 / 4 = 5.25 crackers left.
Response:  If Matthew has 22 small Krakens and 34 large Krakens, and he wants to divide them equally among his 11 friends, how many small Krakens will each friend get?  We can start by dividing the total number of Krakens (22 + 34 = 56) by the number of friends (11). So, each friend will get approximately 5 small Krakens.
"Response:  If Matthew has 29 small balls and 30 big balls, and he wants to know how many small balls are in 5 groups of equal size, then we can calculate it as follows:

Number of small balls = Total number of small balls / Number of groups
= 29 / 5
= 5.8

So there will be approximately 5.8 small balls in each group."
Response:  If Matthew has 14 small crackers and 21 big crackers, and he wants to share them equally among his 7 friends, how many crackers will each friend get?  To find out, we can divide the total number of crackers (35) by the number of friends (7). So, each friend will get: 35 / 7 = 5 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew has $18 worth of coins, and there are 36 crackers in total, then each cracker costs $0.50 (divide $18 by 36). So if one person has 9 crackers, another person has 27 crackers (divide $18 by 36 to get the cost per cracker, multiply that number by the amount of crackers they have).
Response:  If there were initially 36 crackers in total (krakki), and then 12 more crackers were added to each of the two bowls (paljudele), how many crackers would be left after adding them all together?  Therefore, the final number of crackers is: 36 + (2 x 12) = 50.
Response:  There are 11 krakkers in total after Mattias has taken 23 of them. If we divide the remaining krakkers equally among the other players, then each player will get how many krakkers?
Response:  If Matthew has 31 crackers and he gives away 23 of them to his friends, then he has left with 8 crackers (Matthew - 23 = 8).
Response:  We have 40 people who can lift weights of up to 15 kg each (Matthew and his friends). If there are 32 strongmen and 98 weak men, how many weightlifters do we have in total?
Response:  If there are 10 big brothers and 8 small sisters, then each big brother has 2 small sisters (since they are divided equally). So, the number of small sisters for one big brother is 2. Now, if we have 4 big brothers, then each big brother has 8 small sisters ( since they are divided equally among all big brothers). Therefore, the total number of small sisters is 32 (4 x 8 = 32).
Response:  We have 28 people who want to buy something from Matthew and his team. If there are 13 big spenders and 15 small spenders among them, how many will each person get?
"Response:  We know that there were initially 109 puppies and they lived for 74 days. So, we can calculate how many puppies Debbie bought as follows:
Debbie bought puppies = Total number of puppies / Number of days they lived x 100
= 109/74 x 100
= 146 puppies
So, Debbie bought 146 puppies."
Response:  If there are 153 dogs and they eat for 17 days, then each dog will have eaten for how many days?  So, the number of dogs that ate for one day is: 153 / 17 = 9.
Response:  We know that Debbie has 264 puppies and she needs to sell them in 11 days. So, we can calculate how many puppies she will have per day as follows: Number of puppies per day = Total number of puppies / Number of days = 264/11 = 23.63 puppies per day. Therefore, there are approximately 23.63 puppies left after Debbie sells 15 puppies in one day.
Response:  If Debbie has 301 dogs and she can walk them for 144 days per year, then in one year she will have walked 301 x 144 = 42,960 dogs. Now, if there are 157 more dogs than last year, that means this year Debbie will have walked 42,960 + 157 = 43,117 dogs.
Response:  We have 88 vole pellets and 13 lemon drops. If we give 4 vole pellets and 87 lemon drops to each of the many voles, how long will it take for them all to get their share?
Response:  We have 200 dogs of different breeds and 256 lemonade puppies. If we give each dog 312 pieces of candy and 4 lemonade puppies per day, how many days will it take for all the lemonade puppies to be eaten if there are more than enough candies for them? So, the answer is  $Days = \frac{Total Lemonade Puppies}{Candies Per Day} = \frac{256}{312} = 83$ days.
Response:  If we buy 12 puppies and each puppy needs at least 5 weeks to grow, then how many weeks will it take for all of them to grow? So, the total number of weeks needed is 12 x 5 = 60 weeks.
Response:  We know that Debbie had 95 lemons and 180 peaches. If she sold 15 lemonade and 54 peachade, how many days did her lemonade last?  Based on this information, we can calculate how long each piece of lemonade lasted.  For example, if one cup of lemonade was sold for $3, then the revenue from selling one cup of lemonade would be $3 x 15 = $45. Similarly, if one cup of peachade was sold for $2, then the revenue from selling one cup of peachade would be $2 x 54 = $108. So in total, Debbie earned $45 + $108 = $153 from selling both types of drinks. Therefore, the number of days it took for Debbie to sell all her lemonade is $153 / ($3 per cup) = 51 days.
Response:  We know that Debbie had 360 Limonada Pudels and 162 Veepudels. If she sold 122 Veepudels and 9 Limonada Pudels during the first week, how many Limonada Pudels did she have left after selling them?  To find out, we can use the following formula: Number of Limonada Pudels left = Total number of Limonada Pudels - Number of Limonada Pudels sold During the first week Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Number of Limonada Pudels left = 360 - 122 = 238 So, Debbie had 238 Limonada Pudels left after selling 122 Veepudels and 9 Limonada Pudels during the first week.
Response:  We know that Faye has 14 ridges and her mother has 11 ridges. So, we can calculate the difference between them as follows: Difference = 14 - 11 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 more ridges on Faye's palm than on her mother's palm.
Response:  We have 4 pieces of candy and we want to share them equally among 3 people. So each person will get 4/3 = 1 piece of candy. Now let's consider the case where there are 12 plates and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. Each person will get 12/4 = 3 plates.
Response:  We have 16 plates and each plate has 4 ridges. So, we have 16 x 4 = 64 ridges in total. Now, let's count how many pairs of ridges are there. Since every pair of ridges is adjacent to each other, we can count them easily. There are 28 pairs of ridges, and each pair consists of two adjacent ridges. Therefore, the final answer is 64 + 28 = 92 ridges.
Response:  We know that there are 22 pliiatsits in total and 6 of them are big (paaki). So, we have to divide the remaining number of pliiatsits among the small ones (igaühes) such that each group has an equal number. Therefore, the number of pliiatsits in each group is:  Number of small pliiatsits = Total number of pliiatsits - Number of big pliiatsits = 22 - 6 = 16.
Response:  We have 35 plates and 7 different colors. If we want to know how many combinations are possible, we need to count the number of ways each color can be chosen from the total number of plates. So, for example, if we choose red as our first color, there are 35 options for the second plate (since all 35 plates can be colored red). Then, for the third plate, we only have 34 options since one plate has already been colored red. Therefore, the total number of combinations is: 35 x 34 = 1260.
Response:  We have 19 riders and 4 pillion passengers, so in total we have 23 people (19 + 4). Now let's count how many vehicles are there:  There are 27 motorcycles. So, the total number of vehicles is also 27. Therefore, the answer to your question is 27.
Response:  We have 7 ridges and each ridge has 36 plates and 30 wiring crucibles. So, in total we have: 7 x 36 = 252 plates and 30 x 7 = 210 wiring crucibles. Therefore, the total number of parts is 252 + 210 = 462.
Response:  We have 11 plates and each plate has 31 pieces or 31 x 11 = 341 pieces in total. Now we need to count the number of cups. There are 27 cups in total. So, the final answer is 341 + 27 = 368 pieces.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 pieces of candy and she wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 6 pieces of candy (30/5 = 6).
Response:  If there are 8 ridges and each ridge has 6 grooves, then the total number of grooves is 8 x 6 = 48.
Response:  We have 35 apples and 4 plates. If we put 2 apples on each plate, then... (calculate)...we will need 7 plates! So, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  We have 31 plates and we want to divide them equally among 6 people. So each person will get 5 plates (31/6 = 5). Now, let's say that one of the people has already taken 4 plates (4/6 = 0.67), so there are 5 - 4 = 1 plate left for the remaining 5 people. Therefore, the number of plates left is 1.
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 riders and each rider has 71 plates and 24 plates. So, we can calculate the total number of plates as follows: Total number of plates = Number of riders x Plates per rider Total number of plates = 30 x 71 + 30 x 24 = 2160 + 960 = 3120 plates Therefore, there are 3120 plates in total.
Response:  We have 16 ridges (ridale) and we need to find out how many times they are repeated in one direction. So, let's count them:  Ridge 1 - 6 pliiatsits, Ridge 2 - 7 pliiatsits, Ridge 3 - 8 pliiatsits,..., Ridge 16 - 21 pliiatsits. Therefore, there are 21 pliiatsits in one direction.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. If all the buses are full (which means each bus can carry 15 students), then we need to divide the number of students by 7 to find out how many stops each bus needs to make. So, the answer is: 98 / 7 = 14 stops per bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 buses transporting students to school. Since each bus can carry 118 students, we need to find out how many students attend the school. Therefore, the number of students attending the school is equal to the total number of students who can be carried by all buses minus the number of students who walk to school. So, the answer is: Students attending the school = (Number of buses x Number of students per bus) - (Number of walking students). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Students attending the school = (95 x 118) - 0 = 10760. Therefore, there are approximately 10760 students attending the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and 66 students in each classroom. If every bus can carry 6 passengers, then how many buses will be needed for all the students to go on an excursion? Therefore, we need to divide 66 (the number of students per classroom) by 6 (the number of passengers per bus): 66 / 6 = 11. So, we will need 11 buses for all the students to go on an excursion.
Response:  We have 87 classrooms and 58 students in each classroom. Since there are two buses, we need to divide the total number of students by 2. Therefore, the answer is 87/2 = 43. So, one bus can accommodate 43 students.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is equal to 24 x 120 = 2880 students. Since there are 84 bus seats in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 84 to find out how many students fit in each bus: 2880 / 84 = 35 students per bus. So, if more than 35 students are in one bus, then there are more than one class in that bus.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and each class has 66 students. If 22 students do not want to go on the excursion, then how many buses will be needed? Therefore, we can conclude that 8 buses are required. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 102 classrooms and 11 students in each classroom. If one student does not want to go on the trip, then there will be 99 students left. So, if 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then there will be 91 students left.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and 3 buses. If there are 111 students in total, then we can calculate how many students each bus can carry as follows: Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 111 students / 3 buses = 37 students per bus. Therefore, one bus is insufficient to transport all the students, so two more buses are needed.
Response:  We have 46 buses and 92 students. If all the buses are full (which means each bus has its maximum capacity), then how many students can fit in one bus?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. In this case, we have 92 students divided by 46 buses, which gives us an average of 2 students per bus. Therefore, there are 2 students per bus.
Response:  If Haley has 11 classic cars and she loves to collect them, then she must have at least 11 different car models in her collection. Now, if she gives away 9 of those cars, then she will be left with how many cars? So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and takes away 5 from her, then she has 5 marbles left. Now, if we take away another 2 marbles from Haley, she will have 3 marbles left. So, the final number of marbles that Haley has is 3.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to give away 15 of them, how many will she have left after giving some away? So, if she gives away 15 marbles, she will have 9 (23 - 15) marbles left.
Response:  If Haley has 13 positive votes and 50 negative votes, that means she has a total of 63 votes (13 + 50).  Since Haley has 26 positive votes, we can calculate how many more votes she needs to get to 50% as follows:  Number of votes needed = Total number of votes / Percentage required x 100  In this case, the number of votes needed is:  Number of votes needed = 63 / 0.5 x 100 = 126 votes So, Haley needs 126 more votes to reach 50%.
Response:  If we have 20 kuuli and want to know how many can be made with 5 pieces of each color, then we need to divide 20 by 5. So, there are 4 groups of 5 colors each that can be made (20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  If Haley has 28 marbles in her pocket and she gives away 4 of them to her friend, then how many marbles does she have left?  Therefore, the answer is 28 - 4 = 24 marbles.
Response:  The book had 392 pages and Frank read 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages he read per day:  Number of days = Total pages / Number of pages read per day  In this case, the calculation would be: Number of days = 392 pages / 14 pages per day = 27 days So, Frank finished reading the book in 27 days.
Response:  We know that Frank has read 22 books and it took him 569 days to finish reading them all. So, we can calculate the average time he spent reading each book as follows: Time taken to read one book = Total time taken to read all books / Number of books Total time taken to read all books = 569 days x 100% = 56,900 hours Number of books = 22 books x 100% = 2200 hours Therefore, the number of hours Frank spent reading each book is: Hours per book = Total time taken to read all books / Number of books = 56,900 hours / 22 books = 2574.5 hours Approximately 2574.5 hours or around 106 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 6 days and there are 24 chapters in the book. So, he read one chapter per day. Therefore, he read 6 x 24 = 144 chapters in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read 555 pages of his grandmother's book in total and it was divided into 5 volumes with each volume containing 110 pages. To find out how many days he spent reading each volume, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages per volume. In this case, the total number of pages is 555, and the number of pages per volume is 110, so we get: Number of days = 555 / 110 = 5 days per volume. Now, since Frank read all five volumes, we need to multiply the number of days he spent reading each volume by the number of volumes he read: Number of days = 5 x 5 = 25 days. Therefore, Frank spent 25 days reading his grandmother's book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read his grandmother's book for 660 days to finish it. Now, let's calculate how many pages he read per day. We can do this by dividing the number of pages in the book (193) by the time taken to read it (660 days). So, Frank read approximately 193/660 = 0.294 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read 249 pages of the book in total and he spent 3 days to finish it. So, if he reads one page per day, then he will spend $3 \times 249 = 747$ minutes reading the book. Since there are $60$ minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of hours as follows: $\frac{747}{60} = 12.45$ hours. Therefore, Frank took approximately $12.45$ hours to read the entire book.
Response:  If Frank read 66 pages of the Bible in 12 days, then he read 5.5 pages per day (66/12 = 5.5). Now, if it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books of the Bible, then he had enough time to read 87 books (492 / 5.5 = 87). Therefore, there are 87 books left after Frank finished reading them all.
"Response:  If Oma had 112 pages in her notebook and she spent 16 days to fill it up, then we can calculate how many lines of text she wrote per day as follows:

Days = 16
Lines per Day = Total Lines / Days
= 112 / 16
= 7
So, Oma wrote approximately 7 lines of text per day."
Response:  If there are 8 pages in each book and there were 576 books in total, then it would take approximately 71 days to read all of them (576 / 8 = 71).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 41 books and each book contains 450 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in all his books is 41 x 450 = 17600 pages. Now, to find out how many days it took Frank to read all these pages, we are given that he spent 30 days reading. So, the number of pages he read per day is 17600 / 30 = 586 pages per day.
Response:  We know that there are three books and each book has 594 pages. To finish reading all the books, it took Frank 607 days. So, if we divide the number of pages by the time taken to read them, we get... (calculate)...the number of pages per day is 594 / 607 = approximately 0.97 pages per day.
Response:  The book had 8 chapters (peatükki), and each chapter contained 50 pages (lehekülj). Therefore, the total number of pages in the book was 8 x 50 = 400 pages. Since Frank worked for 664 days, he could have written half of the book during that time, which is 400/2 = 200 pages. So, one day Frank wrote approximately 2 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we need to convert $120 into euros. According to current exchange rates, €1 = $1.18. So, $120 is equal to €140. Now, let's calculate how many DVD packs Kuus can buy with €140. We know that each DVD pack costs €15, so: €140 / €15 = 9.33 DVD packs. Therefore, Kuus can buy at most 9 DVD packs for $120.
Response:  If Kui has $81 to spend and he wants to buy as many DVDs as possible, then we can calculate how many DVDs he can buy with his budget of $81. To do this, we need to divide $81 by the cost of one DVD, which is $20. So, Kui can buy 4 DVDs ($81 / $20 = 4).
Response:  If one pack of DVDs costs $107 and you can buy 10 more for $106, then if you buy how many DVDs can you get for $93? Solution: To find out how many DVDs you can buy with $93, we need to divide $93 by the cost per DVD ($107 - $106 = $1). So, you can buy 93 / 1 = 93 DVDs.
Response:  If the cost of each DVD is $76 and you have $25 to spend in total, how many DVDs can you buy if you want to maximize your purchase?  To find out, we need to divide the total amount of money available for purchasing DVDs ($25) by the cost of one DVD ($76). This gives us the number of DVDs that can be bought with the given budget: Number of DVDs = Total amount available for purchasing DVDs / Cost of one DVD = $25 / $76 = 3.14 (approximately 3 DVDs) So, based on the information provided, you can buy approximately 3 DVDs with the given budget.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $104 is divided into 4 parts of $26 each. So, to find out how many DVD packs can be bought with $104, we need to divide $104 by $26. Therefore, the number of DVD packs that can be bought with $104 is: $$ \frac {104}{26} = 4 $$ So, there are 4 DVD packs that can be bought with $104.
Response:  If Saab wants to buy two DVD packs for $28 each, then he will have to pay a total of $56 (2 x $28).

Response:  If Brenda has 38 pairs of shoes and she gave away 19 pairs, then how many pairs of shoes does she have left? So, Brenda has 38 - 19 = 19 pairs of shoes left.
Response:  If Brenda has 14 eggs and she wants to make 30 cakes, then we need to divide 14 by 30 to find out how many eggs each cake will require. So, the number of eggs required for one cake is 14/30 = 0.467 or approximately 5 eggs per cake.
Response:  We have 22 cups and we want to know how many full cups there are if some of them are empty. If all the cups were full, then there would be 22 x 4 = 88 full cups. However, since some of the cups are empty, we need to subtract the number of empty cups from the total number of cups. So, if 17 cups are empty, then the number of full cups is 88 - 17 = 71. Therefore, there are 71 full cups.
Response:  We have 18 cups and we want to know how many different combinations of 5 cups each can be made. To do this, we need to count the number of ways in which we can choose 5 cups from the total of 18 cups. There are 3 choices for the first cup, 2 choices for the second cup, 1 choice for the third cup, and so on until we reach the last cup. Therefore, there are a total of 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 possible combinations of 5 cups each. So, if we have 18 cups and want to make 5 cups at a time, we can make 6 different combinations.
Response:  If there are 14 different types of candy and each type has 5 pieces, then in total there will be 14 x 5 = 70 candies. But if we assume that some people have more than one piece of each type, then the total number of candies will be greater. For example, if 3 people have 2 pieces of each type, then the total number of candies will be 3 x 2 = 6. So the correct answer is 6.
Response:  If Brenda has 5 pairs of shoes and she wants to give 2 pairs to her friend, then how many pairs will she have left after giving them away?  So, if Brenda has 10 pairs of shoes in total, then she will have 8 pairs left (5 - 2 = 8).
Response:  If there are 42 committees and each committee has 5 members, then the total number of people in all committees is 42 x 5 = 210.
Response:  If Frank had some commodities and he gave 26 kilograms of wheat to 33 people, how much commodity did Frank have in total if each person got a lot of commodity?
Response:  If there are 33 commies and each of them has 24 neckties, then the total number of neckties is: 33 x 24 = 786. Now, if one of the commies has 9 ties more than the others, then the total number of neckties for all the commies is: 786 + 9 = 795. Therefore, the answer is 795.
Response:  If Frank has 11 commi and there are 22 commi in total, then Frank's share is 11/22 = 0.5. So, Frank's portion of the cake is half.
Response:  If Frank has 16 commi and he wants to divide them equally among 4 houses, then each house will get 4/16 = 1/4 of the total number of commi. So, there are 4 x 1/4 = 1 commi per house. Therefore, if Frank has 16 commi, then he has 16 / 4 = 4 commi for each of the 4 houses.
Response:  We have to divide 25 into 14 parts. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a mathematical operation that divides one number (dividend) by another number (divisor). In this case, we need to divide 25 by 14. So, how many parts of 14 will be in each part of 25? Well, if we divide 25 by 14, we get: 25 ÷ 14 = 360/14 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 parts of 14 karpi in each part of 25 trefoilide karpi.
Response:  If Shirley has 10 foils and wants to divide them equally among 5 friends, each friend will get 2 foils (10 / 5 = 2).
Response:  We know that there were 67 puddles of traditional soup and 9 puddles of diet soup. So, we have to find out how many more puddles of traditional soup are than puddles of diet soup.  Therefore, let X be the number of puddles of traditional soup minus the number of puddles of diet soup. Then, we can write an equation as follows:  X = 67 - 9.  Now, we need to solve for X. Can you do it?
Response:  We know that there were 22 dogs of different breeds and 61 dogs with diabetes. So, we need to find out how many more dogs had diabetes than were of different breeds. Therefore, the difference between the number of dogs with diabetes (61) and the number of dogs of different breeds (22) is equal to 49. Thus, there are 49 more dogs with diabetes than there were dogs of different breeds.
Response:  We have 30 puppies of toy breed and 8 puppies of diet food. So, in total we have 30 + 8 = 38 puppies. Now, there are 41 ounces of milk left over after feeding all these puppies. Since each puppy needs about 2-3 ounces of milk per day, we can calculate that they consumed approximately 41 / (2 - 3) = 27 - 36 puppies worth of milk. Therefore, the number of puppies that were fed is between 27 and 36.
Response:  We know that there are 79 puppies in total and they were divided into three groups - 53 puppies in the regular group, 42 puppies in the diet group, and none in the limonada group. So, we can calculate the number of puppies in each group as follows: Regular group = Total puppies x Percentage of puppies in this group = 79 x (100/3) = 26 Puppies Diet group = Total puppies x Percentage of puppies in this group = 79 x (53/3) = 28 Puppies Limonada group = Total puppies x Percentage of puppies in this group = 79 x (0/3) = 0 Puppies Therefore, there are more puppies in the diet group than in the regular or limonada groups combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 dogs eating diet food and 83 dogs eating regular food. So, we have:

Diet food dogs = 54
Regular food dogs = 83 - 54 = 39

Now, let's find out how many more dogs are eating regular food than those eating diet food:

Number of dogs eating regular food minus number of dogs eating diet food = 39 - 54 = -15

So, there are 15 fewer dogs eating regular food than those eating diet food."
Response:  We know that there were 17 puppies in total and 9 of them had been vaccinated. So, we have 9/17 = 0.53  puppies who did not get vaccinated. Since Neil was responsible for all 29 dogs, he must have taken care of the remaining 0.53 x 29 = 14.67 unvaccinated puppies. Therefore, the number of puppies that Neil took care of who did not get vaccinated is 14.
Response:  We know that there are 19 puppies eating diet food and 60 puppies eating regular food. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of puppies eating regular food = Total number of puppies x Percentage of puppies eating regular food  In this case, the percentage of puppies eating regular food is given as 60/159 = 0.38 or 38%. Now, we need to find out how many puppies are eating regular food. Therefore, we multiply the total number of puppies by the percentage of puppies eating regular food:  Number of puppies eating regular food = Total number of puppies x Percentage of puppies eating regular food  Number of puppies eating regular food = 159 x 0.38  = 57 puppies So, there are 57 puppies eating regular food. As for the remaining puppies, since they are eating diet food, we can say that their number is equal to the total number of puppies minus the number of puppies eating regular food:  Number of puppies eating diet food = Total number of puppies - Number of puppies eating regular food  Number of puppies eating diet food = 159 - 57  = 102 puppies Therefore, there are 102 puppies eating diet food.
Response:  We know that there are 72 puppies of toy breed and 32 puppies of small breed. So, in total we have 104 puppies. Now let's find out how many more puppies of large breed than medium breed. Large breed has 78 puppies, so we need to subtract the number of medium breed puppies from the number of large breed puppies. Therefore, the difference between the number of large breed puppies and medium breed puppies is 78 - 32 = 46 puppies. So, there are 46 more puppies of large breed than medium breed.
Response:  We know that there are 36 ounces of tofu plus 80 puddings and 54 puddings of diet soy milk. So in total we have: 36 + 80 + 54 = 160 puddings. Since an ounce is equal to 28 grams, we can convert the number of puddings to grams as follows: 160 puddings x 28 grams/pudding = 4320 grams. Therefore, there are more than 4320 grams of puddings.
Response:  We know that there were 30 dogs in total and 28 of them were old and needed to eat dog food with less salt. So, we have 28 dogs that need to eat dog food with less salt. Now, let's calculate how many dogs did not eat dog food with less salt. We can do this by subtracting the number of dogs that needed to eat dog food with less salt from the total number of dogs. Therefore, the answer is 28 - 28 = 0 dogs that did not eat dog food with less salt.
Response:  If there were 79 more puddles than dogs in the park, and each dog had 4 treats instead of diet treats, then how many treats would each dog have if they had 10 puddles less than dogs?  Therefore, if Neil had 79 more puddles than dogs, he would have 79 x 4 = 316 treats.
Response:  We have 3 groups of puppies: toidukaupluses (57), diet limonads (26), and kerget limonads (27). So, in total we have 104 puppies.
"Response:  We know that there are 81 puppies in total and they are divided into three groups - 60 puppies who eat regular food (tavast limonaadi), 60 puppies who eat diet food (dieetlimonaadi), and 60 puppies who eat carrot food (kerget limonaadi). So, we have:

Total number of puppies = 81
Number of puppies eating regular food = 60
Number of puppies eating diet food = 60
Number of puppies eating carrot food = 60

Now, let's compare the numbers:

Regular food group has more puppies than diet food group (60 vs 60) and carrot food group (60 vs 60). Therefore, the answer is: More puppies eat regular food than diet food or carrot food."
Response:  We have 49 puppies that eat regular food and 40 puppies who eat diet food. So, in total we have 49 + 40 = 89 puppies eating something. Now, there are also 6 puppies who eat kibble food. Therefore, the total number of puppies eating any kind of food is 89 + 6 = 95 puppies.
Response:  We know that there were 317 guests at Buckingham Palace yesterday and 295 guests the day before. So if more people came yesterday than the day before, we can say that the difference between the number of guests yesterday and today is equal to the total number of guests who attended both days minus the number of guests who attended only one of the two days. Therefore, the difference in the number of guests = 317 - (295 + 295) = 317 - 590 = -273 guests.
Response:  If there were 246 guests at Buckingham Palace last night and it takes 25 days for them to visit, then we can calculate how many guests visited in total over those 25 days as follows: Number of guests = Total number of guests x Number of days = 246 x 25 = 6,150 guests.
Response:  If there were 100 guests at the palace last night and now there are 666 guests, then we can conclude that the number of additional guests is 666 - 100 = 566. So, in total, there are 566 more guests this evening than there were last night at Buckingham Palace.
Response:  We know that there were 132 guests at Buckingham Palace last night and Rachel found out that 406 people have visited Buckingham Palace in total over the past 327 days. So if we divide the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday by the total number of visitors over the past 327 days, we get... (insert calculation here)
Response:  If there were 45 foreign guests at Buckingham Palace last night and 829 people visited it during the past 85 days, then we can calculate how many visitors per day there are as follows:  Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Time period (in days) So, if we divide the total number of visitors (829) by the time period (85 days), we get the average number of visitors per day: Average number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Time period (in days) = 829 / 85 = 9.76 visitors per day Now, let's find out how many visitors per day there would be if 850 people visited Buckingham Palace every day for 85 days: Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Time period (in days) = 850 / 85 = 10 visitors per day Therefore, based on these calculations, there would be approximately 10 visitors per day at Buckingham Palace if 850 people visit it every day for 85 days.
Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings sold at the previous auction and 557 collectors attended this auction. To find out how many more collectors came to the auction than last time, we can subtract the number of collectors who attended last time from the total number of collectors attending this auction:  557 - 188 = 369  So, 369 more collectors came to the auction compared to the previous one.
Response:  We know that there were 661 guests at Buckingham Palace yesterday and 600 guests the day before. So, if we subtract the number of guests from the previous day (600) to find out how many more guests came this day: 661 - 600 = 61 Therefore, there are 61 additional guests who came to Buckingham Palace compared to the previous day.
Response:  We know that in the previous year (year before the current one), there were 419 visitors to Buckingham Palace. In addition, we are told that 92 more people visited this palace this year compared to last year. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get: 419 + 92 = 511. Therefore, there were 511 visitors to Buckingham Palace this year.
Response:  We know that in the previous year (year 3), there were 471 visitors to Buckingham Palace. In the current year (year 4), there are 512 visitors. So, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:  Difference = 512 - 471 = 41 Therefore, there are 41 more visitors this year compared to last year.
Response:  We know that in one day (Saturday), there were 705 tourists at Buckingham Palace. In the previous Saturday, there were 191 tourists and in the previous Saturday before that, there were 457 tourists. So, if we compare the number of tourists between two Saturdays, we can see that there are more tourists this Saturday than last Saturday, which means that the difference is 457 - 191 = 266 tourists. Therefore, the answer is 266.
Response:  If there are already 159 grams of sugar in the jar and we add another 628 grams, then the total amount of sugar in the jar is now: 159 + 628 = 787 grams. So, the remaining amount of sugar in the jar after adding the additional 628 grams is 787 - 159 = 628 grams.
Response:  We know that the total weight of all the pieces is 49 grams and we have 288 grams of chocolate left after giving some away. So, if we divide the remaining chocolate by the number of pieces, we get: Number of grams per piece = Total weight of chocolate / Number of pieces = 288 g / 5 pieces = 57.6 grams per piece. Therefore, each piece of chocolate weighs approximately 57.6 grams.
Response:  We have to find out how much weight is left after removing 57 grams of salt from 353 grams of flour. So we need to subtract 57 grams from 353 grams.  Subtracting 57 grams gives us 296 grams of flour remaining. Therefore, there are 296 grams of flour left after removing 57 grams of salt.
Response:  If we have 166 grams of meat and there are 20 grams left over, then we can calculate how many grams more were in the original amount of meat. To do this, we divide the remaining amount (20 grams) by the total amount of meat (166 grams). This gives us a ratio of 166/20 = 8.3. So, there were 8.3 times as much meat originally as there was in the remaining amount.
Response:  If there are 557 grams of meat and only 17 grams of fat, then we can calculate how much fat is in each gram of meat as follows: Fat content = Total fat / Total weight = 17 g / 557 g = 0.0302 (or approximately 3.02%) So if we have x grams of meat, then the amount of fat in it is x x 0.0302 = x grams of fat Now let's find out how many grams of meat we need to have to get y grams of fat. We know that the ratio of fat to meat is constant at 3.02%, so we can write an equation based on this: Number of grams of meat = Number of grams of fat / 0.0302 = y grams of fat / 3.02% = x grams of meat Solving for x, we get: x = y / 3.02 % = 557 g / 3.02% = 18.14 grams Therefore, to get 18.14 grams of fat, you would need 557 grams of meat.
Response:  If there are initially 11 grams of sugar and after stirring it has increased to 492 grams, then we can calculate how much more sugar is present as follows:  Additional amount = Initial amount + Amount gained - Original amount = 11 g + (492 g - 11 g) = 480 g So, the additional amount of sugar is 480 grams.
Response:  If there are 94 participants and each participant has to bring at least 90 bottles of wine for the auction, then the total number of bottles that will be brought is: 94 x 90 = 8560 bottles.
Response:  If there are 266 participants and they want to eat 90 bunches of grapes in one day, then each participant will get 0.34 bunches per person (90 / 266). Now, if it takes 5 days for all participants to eat their share of grapes, then each participant will have 0.07 bunches per day (0.34 x 5 = 0.17). So, in total, there will be 17 bunches of grapes left after 5 days (266 - 0.17 = 249).
Response:  If there are 294 participants and they collectively collected 244 bunches of grapes and 47 bunches of berries, then each participant has collected an average of 0.85 bunches of grapes (244/294) and 0.13 bunches of berries (47/294). Now, if we want to know how many days it took for each participant to collect 146 bunches of grapes, we can divide the total number of bunches collected by the number of participants and the number of days taken per participant: 146 / (0.85 x 294) = 168 days. Therefore, it took approximately 168 days for each participant to collect 146 bunches of grapes.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are between the two events. The first event is when the owner of the lemur had 100 juicy apples and the second event is when the owner of the lemur had 221 juicy grapes. So, we need to subtract the number of days between these two events from the total number of days that the lemur lived. Accordingly, if the lemur lived for 235 days, then it means that there were 148 days (235 - 77) left after the second event occurred.
Response:  If there are 252 participants and they collectively saved $108 for 57 days, then each participant contributed an average of $\$58$.
Response:  We have 36 participants who want to make their own wine and they can collect up to 8 bunches of grapes per day. How many bunches of grapes will each participant be able to collect in total over 240 days?
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has 52 fish inside it. So, in total, we have 26 x 52 = 1320 fish in all the aquariums together. Therefore, the number of fish in one aquarium is 1320 / 26 = 50 fish per aquarium.
Response:  We have 40 fish tanks and each tank has two meters long. So, we can calculate the total length of all fish tanks as follows: Total length = Number of tanks x Length of one tank = 40 x 2 = 80 meters. Therefore, there are 80 meters of aquarium in the room.
Response:  We know that there are 56 school aquariums and 10 maglev aquariums in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of school aquariums + Number of maglev aquariums.  In this case, the total number of aquariums is equal to 39 (the length of the aquarium). Therefore, we can set up another equation: Number of school aquariums + Number of maglev aquariums = 39. Now let's solve for the number of school aquariums: Number of school aquariums = 39 - Number of maglev aquariums Substituting the value given in the question, we get: Number of school aquariums = 39 - 10 = 29 So, there are 29 school aquariums in the aquarium.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums with fish and 22 aquariums without fish. So, in total, we have 96 aquariums (74 + 22). Now, let's calculate how many liters of water each aquarium contains. If an average aquarium has 46 liters of water, then the total volume of water in all 96 aquariums is 46 x 96 = 43584 liters. Finally, to find out how much water Tyler has, we need to divide the total volume of water by the number of aquariums he owns. Therefore, Tyler has 43584 / 96 = 45.8 liters of water.
Response:  We have 15 aquariums with fish and 62 aquariums without fish. The total number of tanks is 19 (15 + 62). So, if we divide the number of tanks with fish by the total number of tanks, we get: Number of fish per tank = Total number of tanks with fish / Total number of tanks  Number of fish per tank = 15 / 19 = 0.79 (approximately) Therefore, there are approximately 8 fish in each tank.
Response:  If an adult buys 13 packages of candy, and each package contains 39 pieces of candy, then how many candies will be in total?
Response:  If Ema buys 66 sets of cards and each set contains 3 cards, then the total number of cards she has is 66 x 3 = 198 cards.
Response:  If Emma bought 28 packages of candy that contained 56 pieces of each type of candy, then if she had more types of candies than just those 3, how many total pieces of candy did she buy in total?
Response:  If she bought 53 packages of candy and gave away 57 packs of candies, then she had 34 pieces left. So, if she sold each package for $10, then she made $340 from selling those remaining pieces of candy.
Response:  If Ema has 51 votes and she can buy three packs of candy with each vote, then...
Response:  If Ema has chosen 70% of the votes and she can buy 14 packs, then we need to find out how many votes are left after Ema buys 14 packs. We know that if Ema chooses 70% of the votes, then she will choose 70/100 = 35 votes. So, there are 65 votes remaining (100 - 35). Therefore, if Palju more than 35 votes have been voted for Ema, then they are equal to or greater than 65 votes.
Response:  We have 4 large bags of rice and each bag contains 36 smaller bags or rice grains. So, in total we have 4 x 36 = 144 smaller bags of rice. Therefore, there are 144 small bags of rice for every one large bag of rice.
"Response:  If there are 33 cups of water in one container and 11 cups of water in another container, then we can calculate how many more cups of water are in the second container compared to the first container. To do this, we divide the number of cups in the second container (11) by the number of cups in the first container (33):

Number of additional cups = Number of cups in second container / Number of cups in first container = 11 / 33 = 0.33 or approximately 1/3

So, if you have 33 cups of water in one container and 11 cups of water in another container, then you have approximately 1/3 more cups of water in the second container than in the first container."
Response:  We have 41 small balls and 53 large balls. To find out how many more large balls there are than small balls, we can divide their number of large balls by that of small balls:  Number of large balls = 53 / 41 = 1.27 (round up to 130). So, there are 130 more large balls than small balls.
Response:  We have 14 cups and 7 bowls. To find out how many times we can fill each bowl with cups, we divide the number of cups (14) by the number of bowls (7). So, we can fill each bowl with approximately 2 cups (14 / 7 = 2). Therefore, there are as many cups as bowls.
Response:  We have 3 cups of water and we want to know how many cups of sugar will fit in it. So, if we divide the number of cups of sugar (21) by the number of cups of water (3), we get 7. Therefore, there are 7 cups of sugar that can fit in 3 cups of water.
Response:  If there are 26 cottages and each cottage has 52 windows, then the total number of windows is: 26 x 52 = 1304 windows. Therefore, if there are 15 committees, then each committee has: 1304 / 15 = 87 windows per committee.
Response:  If there are 14 big pieces and each piece is as large as 3 small pieces, then there will be 14 x 3 = 42 small pieces in total. Since there are also 86 commodities that fit inside these small pieces, we can conclude that there are 42 / 86 = 5 small pieces per commodity. Therefore, the number of small pieces that Sul has is 5 times the number of commodities he has, which is 86. So, Sul has 5 x 86 = 430 small pieces.
Response:  If we have 25 posts in each of the four quarters, then...
Response:  If there are 5 posts in May and each post has 10 comments, then we have 5 x 10 = 50 comments in total for May. Now let's assume that the number of comments per quarter is always equal to the number of months in the quarter multiplied by the average number of comments per month. So if there are 4 quarters in a year, then the total number of comments per year would be 4 x (3 + 6) = 72 comments. Therefore, if there were 50 comments in May alone, then there would be approximately 72 / 4 = 18 comments per quarter.
Response:  If we have $n$ quarters in total and each quarter has $r$ posts, then the number of posts is given by $\text{number of posts} = n \times r$.  Now, if we want to know how many more posts there are than the number of quarters, we can subtract the number of quarters from the total number of posts: $\text{more posts} = \text{total number of posts} - n \times r$.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $\text{more posts} = 24 - (3 \times 4) = 16$. Therefore, there are $16$ more posts than quarters.
Response:  If Ann can write 14 posts in one quarter, and she needs to write 2 more posts for each of the remaining three quarters, then...
"Response:  We have to find out how many posts are in each quarter and then calculate the total number of posts for all quarters.  If there were 32 posts per month and we had 4 quarters (March-May, June-August, September-November, December-February), then:

* March-May has 3 months x 32 posts/month = 96 posts
* June-August has 3 months x 32 posts/month = 96 posts
* September-November has 3 months x 32 posts/month = 96 posts
* December-February has 3 months x 32 posts/month = 96 posts

Total number of posts = 96 + 96 + 96 + 96 = 388 posts
So, if the person posted 32 posts every quarter, they would have posted 388 posts in one year."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 posts in total (78 weeks / 4 quarters = 30 posts per quarter). If we have 19 may posts, then we can calculate how many posts peak during May as follows:

May posts = Total posts - April posts
= 30 - 7
= 23 posts
Therefore, there will be 23 posts peaking in May."
Response:  We have to find out how many posts are in total for 55 quarters. If we get 32 posts per quarter, then the number of posts is: 32 x 55 = 1760 posts.
Response:  If there are 4 posts per quarter, and each quarter has 3 months (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December), then in one year, there will be 4 x 4 = 16 posts. So if there were 81 posts in total, that means there were 81 / 16 = 5 posts per month.
Response:  If there are 4 quarters in a year, then each quarter has 3 months (January, February, March). So, if January starts on the 16th of the month, how many posts can be made during that quarter?
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 minutes and 20 seconds to complete her task in Group C. To find out how many groups she can do in this time, we need to divide the total time by the time taken for each group. So, if it takes Rebecca 1 minute to complete one group, then she can do:

Time available = 10 minutes + 20 seconds = 120 seconds
Number of groups = Time available / Time taken per group
= 120 seconds / 60 seconds (as each group takes 1 minute)
= 2 groups
Therefore, Rebecca can complete 2 groups in the given time."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 cups of coffee and she wants to share it equally among her friends. So, if we divide 10 cups by 15 friends, each friend will get 2/3 cup of coffee (or approximately 66% of a cup). Therefore, the number of cups of coffee that Rebecca can give to her friends is 10 / 15 = 2/3 or approximately 66%.
Response:  If there are 11 groups of 5 people each and Rebecca is in group number 3, then how many people does she have to divide with if there are two more people than her in her group?  Therefore, Rebecca has to divide with 2 + 5 = 7 people.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 friends in Group A and 6 friends in Group B. So, we can write this as follows:  Number of groups = 2 (A + B) Total number of friends = 8 + 6 = 14 Now, we want to find out how many friends are in each group. To do this, we divide the total number of friends by the number of groups: Number of friends per group = Total number of friends / Number of groups = 14 / 2 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 friends in each group.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 cups and 15 marbles. To find out how many groups of marbles she can make with these items, we need to divide the number of marbles by the number of cups. So, if we divide 15 by 4, we get 3. Therefore, Rebecca can make 3 groups of marbles using what she has.
Response:  We know that Rebecca is 18 years old and has $72 in her bank account. If she wants to buy something expensive, she needs at least $66 more. So, the total amount of money she will need is $72 + $66 = $138.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has $99 in her purse and she gave away $10 to each of the three beggars. So, she spent a total of $30 ($10 x 3). Now, we have $69 left with Rebecca ($99 - $30 = $69). And finally, we know that Rebecca received $27 from her friends as a gift. So, now Rebecca has $46 ($69 + $27) in her purse.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 marbles and she gave 6 of them to her friend. So now Rebecca has 20 - 6 = 14 marbles left. If we add 14 marbles to Rebecca's original number of marbles (which was 20), then we get 20 + 14 = 34 marbles in total. Therefore, if Rebecca had more than 34 marbles, they would be as many as marble.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 cups of coffee and 12 cookies. If she drinks more coffee than cookies, then we can say that for every cup of coffee she drinks, she will have more marbles than before. So let's assume that for each cup of coffee she drinks, she gets 3 additional marbles (since there are 3 marbles in one cookie). Therefore, if she drinks x cups of coffee, she will have x \* 3 = 3x marbles extra. Now, since she already has 5 cups of coffee, she will have 5 \* 3 = 15 marbles extra. So, Rebecca has 17 marbles in total (5 + 15).
Response:  If Luke has scored 154 points and he got 11 points wrong, then we can calculate his score as follows:  Score = Total points - Wrong points = 154 - 11 = 143 points So, Luke scored 143 points in the trivia game.
Response:  If Luke has answered 177 questions correctly and he got 46 points for each correct answer, then the total number of points he earned is: 177 x 46 = 8320 points.
Response:  If Luke got 84 points after two rounds of trivia game and he scored equally in both rounds, then he would have scored 42 points per round. So if he played three rounds, he would have scored 126 points (42 x 3).
Response:  If Luke has scored 146 points in 10 questions and he wants to get 157 correct answers, then we need to calculate how many questions he needs to take to reach that goal. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of questions = (Desired score / Actual score) x 10 Where: Desired score is the number of points Luke wants to achieve (in this case, 157), and Actual score is the number of points he has already achieved (which is 146). So, plugging in these values, we get: Number of questions = (157 / 146) x 10 = 103 Therefore, Luke needs to take 103 questions to reach his desired score of 157 points.
Response:  If Luke got 3 points for each correct answer and he answered 78 questions correctly, then...
Response:  We have two halves of an orange and we want to divide them into 32 equal parts. Each part should contain one slice of orange. So, if there are x slices in each half, then there will be 2x slices in total. Therefore, the number of parts is 2x = 40.
Response:  We know that Emily has 11 pairs of shoes and she wants to buy 2 more pairs. So, in total, Emily will have 11 + 2 = 13 pairs of shoes. Therefore, Emily had 13 pairs of shoes.
Response:  We know that Emily has 8 hours to spend and she wants to divide them equally among her friends. So, each friend will get 2 hours (8/4 = 2). Now we need to find out how many times 2 hours is equal to 16 hours. To do this, we can divide 16 by 2, which gives us 8. Therefore, Emily spends 8 times with each of her 4 friends.
Response:  We have 18 cakes and 6 packaging boxes. Each box can hold 4 cakes. So we need to divide 18 by 6 to find out how many boxes are needed for each cake. Therefore, there are 3 boxes per cake (18/6 = 3).
Response:  We know that Emily has 5 marbles in total and she wants to share them equally among her friends. If she gives 4 marbles to each of her friends, then how many marbles does she have left? So, Emily has 1 marble left after sharing it with her friends. Therefore, the number of marbles Emily had is 1.
Response:  We know that there are 72 small balls and we have to divide them equally among 6 big bags. So each bag will contain how many small balls?  To find out, let's use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we need to divide 72 by 6 to find out how many small balls each bag will contain.  So, if we divide 72 by 6, we get... (insert calculation)...which means that each bag will contain 12 small balls! Therefore, Emily will put 12 small balls in each of the 6 big bags.
Response:  We know that there are 43 small balls and each ball has 5 holes. So, in total we have 43 x 5 = 215 holes. Now, we need to find out how many big holes there are. According to the problem, for every 20 small holes, one big hole is made. Therefore, the number of big holes is equal to the number of small holes divided by 20. So, the answer is 215 / 20 = 10.75 big holes.
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 small balls and she gives 26 of them to her friend. So, now Emily has 18 less balls than before (44 - 26 = 18). Now we are asked how many big balls Emily had originally. To find this out, we can divide the number of small balls Emily gave away by the number of small balls she had initially. In other words, we can calculate the ratio of small balls given away to small balls remaining with Emily. This ratio is 2/3 or 2 helmiku (in Estonian). Therefore, Emily had 30 big balls initially (18 / 2 = 30).
Response:  We know that there are 819058 people living in Lawrence's county and 668278 of them have cars. If we assume that each car has an average of 3-4 passengers, then...
Response:  We know that there are 100 children in total and they are divided into two groups of 50 each. Now we need to find out how many children will be left with Mr. Lawrence if he takes 777622 from one group and 202958 from the other. To do this, we can use division. So, the number of children who will be left with Mr. Lawrence is: 777622 / 50 = 15544 (from the first group) + 202958 / 50 = 4059 (from the second group) = 19603 Total number of children left with Mr. Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 people in total and 629424 of them have already left their homes to escape the war. So, we need to find out how many people are still at home. To do this, we can divide the number of people who haven't left (629424) by the total number of people (898051). This gives us a proportion of 73.6%. Therefore, there are approximately 611537 people who are still at home.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 days between the two dates given in the question. Now, we need to find out how many times 274865 fits into this time period. To do this, we divide the number of days (313473) by the number of years (274865): 313473 / 274865 = 1.15 years. So, approximately every 1.15 years, the position of the Moon relative to the Sun and Earth repeats itself.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 days since January 1st, 1970 (the starting point of the Unix epoch). Now, we need to find out how many times 455682 days have passed since January 1st, 1970 until now. To do this, we can divide the total number of days since January 1st, 1970 by the number of days in an average year (365 or 366 days). So,  Total number of days = 907611 days Since January 1st, 1970 = 907611 x 365 = 32,323,305 days Now, let's calculate how many times 455682 days have passed since January 1st, 1970 until now: Number of times 455682 days have passed = 32,323,305 days / 455682 days per year = approximately 73 years and 1 month. Therefore, if there were as many children born every year as the number of seconds in 73 years and 1 month, then there would be approximately 73 \* 365 = 26,675,000 children born each year.
Response:  We know that there are 800059 students in Lawrence's school and they come from different grades (maakonnas). So we need to find out how many students are in each grade. According to the question, the total number of students in all grades is 828521. Now let's calculate the number of students in each grade: Grade 1 has 347 students, Grade 2 has 365 students, Grade 3 has 383 students, etc. Therefore, there are 347 + 365 + 383 +... + x students in each grade, where x is the number of grades. Since there are 10 grades in total, the sum of all these numbers gives us the total number of students in Lawrence's school: 347 + 365 + 383 +... + x = 828521. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, there are 10 times 347 = 3470 students in each grade.
Response:  We know that there are 61619 students in Larry's school and they all have to go through the registration process. So, we can assume that each student has to wait for an average of x minutes before getting registered. Since there are 91676 students in total, including both new and old ones, it means that the total waiting time is equal to the number of new students multiplied by their average waiting time plus the number of old students multiplied by their average waiting time. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Total Waiting Time = (Number of New Students x Average Waiting Time) + (Number of Old Students x Average Waiting Time). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total Waiting Time = (61619 x x) + (91676 x y), where x is the average waiting time for new students and y is the average waiting time for old students. Solving for x and y, we find that x = 30 minutes and y = 20 minutes. Therefore, if there were no delays in the registration process, each new student would have to wait for 30 minutes on average, while each old student would have to wait for 20 minutes on average.
Response:  We know that there are 34044 people living in Lawrence's county and 134867 people who have died. So, we need to find out how many children they had. To do this, we can multiply the number of people alive by the ratio of children per person. According to the text, the average family has 4-5 children. Therefore, if we divide the total number of people alive (34044) by the average number of children per family (4), we get 8509. So, there were approximately 8509 children living in Lawrence's county.
Response:  We know that there are 610769 students in total and 590796 of them have passed the exam. So, we can calculate the number of students who did not pass the exam as follows: Number of students who did not pass the exam = Total number of students - Number of students who passed the exam = 610769 - 590796 = 20000 Lastly, we need to find out how many of these 20000 students are from Lawrence's region. To do this, we divide the number of students from Lawrence's region (22) by the total number of students who did not pass the exam (20000). Therefore, the answer is 22/20000 = 0.011.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 people in Lawrence's county and 893835 people have left their homes to go somewhere else. So, we need to find out how many people have stayed in their homes. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who left from the total population: 644997 - 893835 = 555102. Therefore, there are 555102 people who have stayed in their homes in Lawrence's county.
Response:  We know that Admil has more than one ear, so let's assume he has x ears. Since Jackie has fewer ears than Admil, we can say that Jackie has y ears. Therefore, the difference between Admil and Jackie is equal to x - y. So, the answer is x - y.
Response:  Adami has 10 hours and Jackie has 2 hours. So, Adami has more than Jackie by 8 hours (10 - 2 = 8). Therefore, Adami has more than Jackie by 8 hours.
Response:  If Jackie has 10 eggs and Admil has 8 eggs, then we can say that Admil has 8 - 10 = -2 eggs less than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x eggs, then Admil has x - 2 eggs. Therefore, the difference between the number of eggs Jackie has and the number of eggs Admil has is 2 eggs.
Response:  If Jackie has 10 ounces and Adam has 8 ounces, then we can say that Jackie has x more ounces than Adam. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Jackie's amount = Adam's amount + x  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Jackie's amount = 8 + x  Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:  x = 2  Therefore, if Jackie has 10 ounces, he has 2 more ounces than Adam.
Response:  Adami and Jackie have 6 eggs each. If they combined their eggs, they would have 12 eggs in total. Now, if there are more than 4 eggs in the basket, it means that the basket has 8 or fewer eggs. So, the number of eggs in the basket is 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Adami and Jackie have 7 ounces of candy together. If Tal has more than them, then he must have x ounces of candy. Since Tal has 9 ounces of candy, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 9. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. So Tal has 2 ounces of candy more than Adami and Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adami and Jackie have 12 eggs between them.  Adami has 8 more eggs than Jackie, so Adami has 20 eggs in total (12 + 8 = 20). Therefore, the number of eggs that Tal has is 9 (since it is greater than the combined number of eggs owned by Adami and Jackie).
Response:  We know that Adami is 4 years old and Jackie'l is 10 years old. So, they are together for 4 + 10 = 14 years. Since they are two years older than each other, Adami is 2 years younger than Jackie'l. Therefore, Adami is 14 - 2 = 12 years old.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 89 apples and 11 oranges. So, if we add up all their fruits, we get: Apples + Oranges = 89 + 11 = 90. Therefore, Adami has 90 or more apples than Jackie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helene and her siblings will make 31 houses together. Then, they will build 270 houses in total, including the previous ones. Finally, they built 419 houses before this day. So, if today is Monday, then the number of houses Helen builds tomorrow (Tuesday) would be: 31 + 270 = 291 - 419 = -128 houses. Therefore, Helen will build -128 houses tomorrow.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helene and her siblings will make 90 chocolate cookies, 51 raspberry cookies, and 484 chocolate cookies in total today. So, the total number of cookies they will make is: 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 cookies. Therefore, Helene will make 625 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helene and her siblings made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 strawberry cookies. Then they shared them equally among themselves, so each of them got 86/3 = 28 chocolate cookies and 554/3 = 184 strawberry cookies. Therefore, Helene got 28 + 184 = 212 chocolate cookies and 86 strawberry cookies.
Response:  We know that Helene and her siblings made 144 chocolate cookies and 397 strawberry cookies. So in total they made 541 cookies. Now we need to find out how many strawberry cookies Helene made. According to the passage, she made 85 strawberry cookies. Therefore, the number of strawberry cookies Helene made is 85.
Response:  If Helene and her siblings bake 40 chocolate cookies (Helen baked 19), then they together baked 69 chocolate cookies (40 + 19 = 69).  If they also baked 231 raspberry cookies and 237 chocolate cookies, then the total number of cookies they baked is:  Total number of cookies = Number of chocolate cookies + Number of raspberry cookies = 69 + 231 = 300.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helene and her siblings made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 strawberry cookies together. Then they baked another batch of 75 chocolate cookies and 66 strawberry cookies today. So, in total, Helene has baked 272 chocolate cookies (197 + 75) and 112 strawberry cookies (46 + 66).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Helene and her siblings made 519 chocolate cookies and 300 strawberry cookies. Then they baked 280 chocolate cakes and 359 strawberry cakes. If Helene makes more than these amounts, then she will have to make at least $X$ more cookies or cakes. Therefore, the answer is greater than or equal to $X$.
Response:  If Katie has 81 DS-mängu and her share of them is 59, then we can calculate how many more DS-mängu Katie has than her share by subtracting her share from 81: 81 - 59 = 22. So, Katie has 22 more DS-mängu than her share.
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 DS mängu and her total share of both brothers is 88 mängu. So, she must have had 3 mängu from one brother (let's call him Brother A) and 73 mängu from the other brother (let's call him Brother B). Therefore, Brother A's share is 3/2 = 1.5 mängu, and Brother B's share is 73 - 1.5 = 71.5 mängu. Since Katie received 88 mängu in total, Brother A's share plus Brother B's share equals 88, so Brother A's share is 88 / 2 = 44 mängu, and Brother B's share is 88 - 44 = 44 mängu.
"Response:  We know that Katie is 78 years old and 86 years old in total. The sum of her ages at different times is given as 164. So we can write an equation:

Katie's age = 78 + 86 = 164... (1)

Now, let's find out how many months Katie has lived. According to the problem statement, Katie was born when Sõpradel was 48 years old. Therefore, Sõpradel's current age is:

Sõpradel's age = 48 + 20 (since he was born 20 years ago) = 68... (2)

We also know that Katie has lived for 3/4 of Sõpradel's life. Using equation (2), we can calculate Katie's age in months:

Katie's age in months = 68 x 3/4 = 54 months... (3)

Finally, we can convert Katie's age from months to years by multiplying it by 12:

Katie's age in years = 54 x 12 = 648 years... (4)

Therefore, the answer to the question is 648 years."
Response:  We know that Katie is 84 years old and 19 years younger than her mother. So, Katie's age can be calculated as follows: Katie's age = Mother's age - (Katie's age at birth + Time passed) Now we need to find out how many years have passed since Katie was born. According to the problem statement, Katie was born when her mother was 69 years old. Therefore, the time passed since Katie was born can be calculated as follows: Time passed = Mother's current age - Age of Katie at birth = 84 - 69 = 15 years Now we can calculate Katie's age using the formula provided in the question: Katie's age = Mother's age - (Katie's age at birth + Time passed) = 84 - (19 + 15) = 70 years So, Katie is 70 years old.
Response:  The total number of old men is 80 - 41 = 39. So there are 39 old men.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 bags and Tom had 63 big bags. If we have more bags than Tom has, then...
Response:  If Katie is 57 years old and her mother is 39 years old, then their age difference is 18 years (57 - 39 = 18). Therefore, if Katie has more than 18 friends, she has more friends than her mother does. So, the answer is Yes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19. So in total they had $89. Then, Jason spent some money on something, which reduced his amount to $33. Therefore, the difference between what Jason had before he spent any money and what he has now is $56 ($89 - $33).
Response:  We know that Fred had $86 dollars and Jason had $5 dollars before they spent some money on cars. Now there is $9 dollars left for both of them. So, the total amount of money they have now is: $86 + $5 = $91.
Response:  In one day, Fred made $40 and Jason made $69. So in total, Fred earned $40 + $69 = $109 during that day. Now let's compare it to the previous day when Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. Therefore, Fred gained $109 - ($19 + $16) = $73 more than the previous day.
Response:  We know that in the previous day, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. After they spent some money on cars, Fred now has $21 and Jason has $78. To find out how much more Jason spent than Fred, we can subtract their current amounts: $78 - $21 = $57. So, Jason spent $57 more than Fred.
"Response: 
Fred had $111 and spent some of it on cars. Now he has $115.
Jason had $40 and now he has $44.
So, Fred gained $6 ( $115 - $111) from buying cars.
Jason lost $6 ( $44 - $40)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 and Jason had $3. Then, after Pete bought an auto part, there were $112 dollars. After Jason sold his newspaper, there were $63 dollars left. So, if we subtract the amount of money that was spent from what each person had initially, we can find out how much they have now. Therefore, Fred has $49 - ($112 - $3) = $35 left, and Jason has $3 - ($112 - $3) = $0 left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $78 was spent by Fred and $31 was spent by Jason in the previous year. So, their total spending is $78 + $31 = $109. Now, Jason has earned $14 more than he spent, so his profit is $14. On the other hand, Fred has spent $90 on a new car, which means he has lost $90 - $78 = $12. Therefore, the difference between the amount of money they have after making their investments is: $14 (Jason) - $12 (Fred) = $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred spent $33 dollars in July and $95 dollars in August. So, his total spending for both months is $33 + $95 = $128. Now, we are told that he saved $16 dollars in July and $74 dollars in August. Therefore, his total savings for both months is $16 + $74 = $90. Finally, to find out how much more Fred saved in August than in July, we subtract the amount of money he saved in July from the amount of money he saved in August: $90 - $16 = $74. So, Fred saved $74 more in August than in July.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has spent $111 dollars for his car maintenance and $34 dollars for his auto wash. So, he has saved $86 dollars from these expenses. Now, let's consider Jason's spending. He had $99 dollars in total, but he gave $47 dollars to Fred as a gift. So, Jason is left with $52 dollars. Finally, we add up all the money that each person has - Fred has $86 + $52 = $138 dollars, and Jason has $52 dollars. Therefore, Fred has more money than Jason.
Response:  If Jessie loses 71 kg in one day and she eats 20 kg of food, then her weight loss per day is 71 - 20 = 51 kg/day. So, if she continues to eat this much for many days, she will lose approximately 51 x number of days = 51 x n kilos.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 27 kg and gained 101 kg in one day, then her weight would be: 27 + (101/365) = 49.8 kg. So, if she eats more than usual for one day, her weight will increase to approximately 49.8 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has lost 126 kg in total. This means he had 66 kg left after losing weight. Now, if he eats more than before and gains weight, how much will he gain? To find out, let's divide his remaining weight (66 kg) by the amount of food he eats per day (126 kg). So, if he eats more than before, he will gain approximately 30 kg (66 kg - 36 kg = 30 kg).
Response:  If Jesse can lift 35 kg in one day and his weight is 69 kg, then he has lifted 35/69 = 0.5 times his own body weight in one day. So, if we multiply this number by 7 (the number of days in a week), we get 0.5 x 7 = 3.5 kg per day. Therefore, Jesse has lost approximately 3.5 kg per week.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 114 kg at first and lost 50 kg in one year, then her weight after one year would be 114 - 50 = 64 kg. Then she gained 60 kg more in the next year, so her total weight now is 64 + 60 = 124 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 124 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie gained 9 kg in one day (praegu). Then, she lost 62 kg over several days (iga päev jooksma), and finally, she gained another 140 kg over even more days (teisel nädalal). So, if we calculate how much weight Jessie gained between these three periods of time, we get:  Weight gain = Total weight after losing - Initial weight + Weight before losing = 140 kg - 62 kg + 9 kg = 79 kg. Therefore, Jessie gained approximately 79 kg of weight between the three periods of time mentioned in the question.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie gained 10 kg in one year (from 82 kg to 92 kg). So, if she continues gaining weight at the same rate every year, after 5 years, her weight will be:  Weight after 5 years = Initial weight x (1 + Rate of change) ^ 5 Where, Initial weight is 82 kg and Rate of change is 10 kg/year. Substituting these values, we get: Weight after 5 years = 82 kg x (1 + 0.10)^5 Weight after 5 years = 97.6 kg Therefore, if Jessie continues gaining weight at the same rate every year, her weight after 5 years will be approximately 97.6 kg.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 mice and 61 alligators. If 64 mice escaped, then we can conclude that the number of remaining mice is equal to the total number of mice minus the number of mice that escaped. Therefore, the number of mice left behind is:  Number of mice = Total number of mice - Number of mice that escaped = 95 - 64 = 31.
Response:  If there were 93 mice and 97 alligators, and 40 alligators caught, then...
Response:  We have 3 + 75 = 78 alligators and 82 - 19 = 63 alligators left after some are fed. So, there were initially 78 alligators and after feeding some of them, there were 63 alligators left.
Response:  We have 79 looms and we need to find out how many alligators can be fed with 24 mud and 51 alligators. So, if we divide 79 by 24, we get 3.25. And if we multiply that number by 51, we get 168. Therefore, there are 168 alligators that can be fed with the given amount of mud.
Response:  If Oli had 171 apples and gave away 134 of them, then he has left with 30 apples. Now, if he gives away more apples after that (let's say 20), then he will have 10 apples left. So, the number of apples Oli has after giving away more than he already did is 10.
Response:  We know that there were initially 160 tomatoes and after 56 were taken out, there were 41 left. So, if we take some more from the remaining 41 tomatoes, how many will be left?  Therefore, the number of tomatoes left after taking 35 more is 7 (41 - 35 = 7).
Response:  If Oli had 90 tomatoes and gave away 154, then he has left with 50 tomatoes. So, the number of tomatoes that Oli has is 50.
Response:  If Oli had 175 tomatoes and 77 cucumbers in his basket, and he gave away 172 cucumbers, then how many tomatoes does he have left? So, there are still 3 tomatoes left with him.
Response:  If Oli had 177 tomatoes and gave away 53 of them, then he has left with how many tomatoes? So, the number of tomatoes Oli has now is 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes.
Response:  If there are 105 red tomatoes and 71 green tomatoes, then together they make 176 tomatoes (105 + 71 = 176).  If you correct 137 tomatoes, then the total number of tomatoes will be 176 + 137 = 313.
Response:  If there are four people and each person needs to cut a large piece of wood, how many pieces can John cut if he has only two saws?  Therefore, John can cut 2 \* 4 = 8 pieces of wood.
Response:  We know that there are 13 large pieces of wood and we want to divide them equally among 4 people so each person gets 8 small pieces of wood less than the large piece they got from John. So, if John gave 1 piece of wood to each of the 4 people, then he would have given a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pieces of wood. Therefore, John gave 8 - 8 = 0 pieces of wood to each of the other 3 people.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 pieces of wood used to build one large log cabin. If each piece is 0.5 meters long (which is what ""naela"" means in Estonian), then the total length of all the pieces used for one log cabin would be:

11 x 0.5 = 5.5 meters

Now, let's find out how many pieces of wood were needed to build three small cabins. We know that each small cabin requires at least 3 logs, and each log is 0.5 meters long, so the total length of all the logs used for three small cabins would be:

3 x 0.5 = 1.5 meters

Finally, we need to subtract the length of the logs used for the small cabins from the total length of logs used for the large cabin to find out how much longer the large cabin is:

5.5 - 1.5 = 4 meters

So, John has built a log cabin that is 4 meters longer than the others."
Response:  We know that there are 12 large and 10 small loaves of bread. If the large loaves contain about 15 pieces per kilogram and the small loaves contain about 5 pieces per kilogram. So we can calculate how many pieces of bread John has in total as follows: Large loaves x number of large loaves = 12 x 12 = 144 Small loaves x number of small loaves = 10 x 10 = 100 Total pieces of bread = 144 + 100 = 244 Therefore, John has 244 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has 30 large pieces of wood and he wants to cut them into smaller pieces so that each piece will be 4 cubic feet in volume. Therefore, he needs 80 small pieces (30 / 4 = 80). Now, we are asked how many small pieces John can get from 16 large pieces. So, if he gets 80 small pieces from 30 large pieces, then he will get 16 x 80 = 1280 small pieces from 16 large pieces.
"Response:  If there are 6 large pieces of furniture that can fit in each room and there are 8 rooms in total, then we have:

6 x 8 = 48 pieces of furniture that can fit in all the rooms together.
Now let's find out how many pieces of furniture John has:
John has 74 pieces of furniture, so he has:

74 / 48 = 1.57 (or approximately 1 5/8) times more pieces of furniture than there are rooms in the house."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 large plates and 17 small plates in total. Each large plate can hold 14 napkins, and each small plate can hold 25 napkins. So, if John uses all of his large plates (which is equal to 12 x 14 = 168 napkins), he will have used up all of the napkins available for him. Therefore, the number of napkins left after John has finished using them is equal to the number of small plates minus the number of napkins used by John, which is equal to 17 - 168 = -151 napkins.
Response:  We know that Robinil has 3 bags of apples and 42 bags of oranges. So, we can calculate the total number of fruits as follows: Apples x Bags = 3 x 10 = 30 Oranges x Bags = 42 x 1 = 42 Total fruits = 30 + 42 = 72 Therefore, Robinil has 72 fruits in total.
Response:  We know that there are 43 bags of rice and 23 bags of sugar. Since Robinil has 8 more bags than sugar, we can say that Robinil has 23 + 8 = 31 bags of rice. Therefore, Robinil has 31 bags of rice.
Response:  We know that Iga has 7 piles of rice and each pile contains 4 grains. Therefore, the total number of grains in all piles is 7 x 4 = 28. Now we are told that Robinil has 6 piles of rice, so the total number of grains in his piles is 6 x 4 = 24. Since every fourth grain from Robinil's piles goes to Iga, the remaining grains in Robinil's piles are equal to 24 - (24 / 4) = 16. So Robinil has 16 piles of rice.
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in a month and 13 weeks in a quarter. So, if we multiply 28 with 13, we get 344 days. Now, let's subtract the number of days in a year (365 or 366) from this total to find out how many days remain. Therefore, the answer is 344 - 365 = -21 days.
Response:  We know that there are 21 small nuts and 45 big commodities. If we take away 9 tukks from Robinil, then how many commodities will be left with him? So, the answer is 36 (21 + 15).
Response:  We know that there are 28 days in September and 14 days in November. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 42. Now, let's divide this number by 6 to find out how many weeks are in Robinil's vacation. Therefore, Robinil has 7 weeks of vacation (42/6 = 7).
Response:  The machine worked for 3 minutes and produced 6 pieces. So, in one minute, it produced 6/3 = 2 pieces. Therefore, the machine worked for 3 minutes to produce 2 x 6 = 12 pieces.
"Response:  The machine works for 5 minutes and takes 4 small breaks of 1 minute each. Therefore, the total time taken by the machine to complete its task is:

Time taken = Total worktime + Breaks = 5 minutes + (4 x 1 minute) = 6 minutes"
"Response:  The machine produces 9 pieces in one minute and 44 pieces in another minute. So, if it takes 3 minutes to produce one piece, then the total time taken for the machine to produce all 44 pieces is:
Time = Number of pieces x Time per piece
= 44 x 3
= 132 minutes
Therefore, the machine will take 132 minutes to produce all 44 pieces."
Response:  The machine produces 13 pieces in one minute and 3 pieces in another minute. So, it takes 8 minutes for the machine to produce all 16 pieces. Therefore, the time taken by the machine to produce all 16 pieces is 8 minutes.
Response:  We have 9 minutes left in the current minute and 8 minutes left until tomorrow morning. So, we will have 17 minutes of work today (9 + 8).
"Response:  The machine worked for 3 minutes in one instance and 4 minutes in another instance. Therefore, we can assume that it took 1 minute to produce 1 unit of output. Now, let's calculate how many units were produced over an 8-minute period:

Minutes = 8
Units per minute = 1
Total units produced = Minutes x Units per minute
= 8 x 1
= 8
Therefore, the machine produced 8 units during the 8-minute period."
Response:  The machine can produce 6 pieces in one minute. So, it will take 12 minutes to make 72 pieces (6 x 12 = 72). And today, it took 14 minutes to make 80 pieces (72 + 14 = 80). Therefore, the number of pieces that the machine can produce per minute is 80 / 14 = 5.71 pieces per minute.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 pieces in one minute. So if it works for 5 minutes, then it will have produced 30 pieces (6 x 5 = 30). And if it continues to work for another hour (12 minutes), then it will have produced an additional 72 pieces (30 x 12 = 72). Therefore, the total number of pieces produced is 102 pieces (30 + 72 = 102).
Response:  The total amount of money spent during carnival is $165 for 5 days. If we divide this amount by the number of days, we get $32 per day. So if they spend more than 5 days at the carnival, the answer will be greater than $165.
Response:  The carnival lasted for 22 days and attracted $144 per day. So, in total, they earned $3088 ($144 x 22).
Response:  The total amount of money spent at the carnival is $420. From this amount, 30 people spent $22 each for a total of $660. So, if we subtract the amount that 30 people spent from the total amount of money spent at the carnival, we get $420 - $660 = -$240. Therefore, there are more than 30 people who played the ring toss game because their spending exceeded the total amount of money spent at the carnival.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that $SORMUSE$ received $382$ dollars on day 44 and $374$ dollars on day 10 after that. So, the difference between these two amounts is:

$$\text{Difference} = 382 - 374 = 8$$

Therefore, the number of days it took for $SORMUSE$ to earn $8$ additional dollars is:

$$\frac{\text{Additional amount}}{\text{Initial amount}} = \frac{8}{382} = \boxed{0.205}$$

So, it took $SORMUSE$ approximately $0.205$ months (or $6.9$ weeks) to earn an additional $8$ dollars."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that $S = 120$ and $T = 66$. Now, let's find out how many times $S$ can be divided into $T$:

$$\frac{S}{T} = \frac{120}{66} = 1.85$$

So, $S$ can be divided into $T$ approximately $1.85$ times."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $S = 325$ and $T = 114$. Now, let's find out how much time has passed between these two points. We can do this by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one: $$Time = T - S = 114 - 325 = -209$$ days have passed since $S$. Therefore, if $\text{S}$ was $325\text{ dollars}$ at time $S$, then it is $-209\text{ dollars}$ now.
Response:  We bought 10 packages of small cookies and 4 packages of large cookies. How many more packages of large cookies did we buy than small cookies?  Therefore, the number of packages of large cookies is 4 - 10 = -6. So, we didn't buy any packages of large cookies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy bought 4 packages of cookies (22 packets) and 16 packs of chocolate (šokolaad). So far so good! Now let's calculate how many total units of each item she bought: Cookies: 22 x 4 = 88 packets Chocolate: 16 x 4 = 64 packs Total number of units: 88 + 64 = 152 units Therefore, the number of units of each type of food that Lucy bought is 152.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packs of chocolate. The total number of cookies was 27 packets. If we assume that each package contains an equal amount of both cookies and chocolate, then...
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy bought 2 packages of small size and 12 packages of large size. Therefore, the total number of packages is:

$$\text{Total number of packages} = \text{Number of small packages} + \text{Number of large packages}$$

We are given that the total weight of all packages was 56 kg, so the weight of each package can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Weight of each package} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{(\text{Number of packages})}$$

Now, let's find out how many kilograms of each type of food Lucy bought:

For small packages:

$$\text{Kilograms of small packages} = \text{Number of small packages} \times \text{Weight of each small package}$$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$\text{Kilograms of small packages} = 2 \times 0.56 = 1.12 kg$$

For large packages:

$$\text{Kilograms of large packages} = \text{Number of large packages} \times \text{Weight of each large package}$$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$\text{Kilograms of large packages} = 12 \times 1.36 = 16.96 kg$$

Therefore, Lucy bought 1.12 kg of small packages and 16.96 kg of large packages, for a total of 18.08 kg of food."
Response:  If there were initially 12 passengers on the bus and each passenger takes up 4 seats, then there will be 48 seats available for new passengers (12 passengers x 4 seats/passenger = 48 seats). So if 9 more passengers get on the bus, there will be 57 seats left (48 available seats + 9 existing passengers = 57 seats). Therefore, the number of passengers that can fit on the bus at any given time is 57.
"Response:  If there are 8 people in one bus and each bus can carry up to 12 passengers plus 3 more who want to get off at the next stop, then we need to calculate how many buses will be needed for all these passengers. So, if there are 8 people per bus, and 15 stops in total (including the starting point), then we will need:

Number of buses = Total number of passengers / Number of passengers per bus
= 15 x 8 + 3 / 8
= 15 x 8 + 3/8
= 120 + 3/8
= 123 buses
Therefore, approximately 123 buses will be needed to transport all the passengers from start to finish."
Response:  We know that there are 4 people on the bus and it takes 13 minutes for each person to get off the bus. So, if we divide the time taken by each person to get off the bus (13 minutes) by the number of people on the bus (4), we will get the total time taken for all 4 people to get off the bus. Therefore, the answer is 52 minutes (4 x 13 = 52).
Response:  If there are 8 people and each person has 11 pieces of candy, then the total number of candies is: 8 x 11 = 88. Therefore, there are 88 candies in total.
"Response:  If there are 22 students and 676 inhabitants in the town, then we can calculate how many students were enrolled in the program as follows:

Number of students enrolled = Total number of inhabitants x Number of students per inhabitant
= 676 x 0.3 (based on the given information)
= 203 students
Therefore, more than half of the inhabitants (51%) of the town were enrolled in the program."
Response:  We know that there are 73 lapses (students), 724 students and 744 teachers. So we can calculate the ratio of students to teachers as follows: Number of students / Number of teachers = 73/744 = 0.096 or approximately 1%. Therefore, there is one teacher for every ten students.
Response:  We have 174 students in total and 521 students who took the exam. If we divide the number of students taking the exam (521) by the total number of students (174), we get...
Response:  We know that there are 61 lapses and 177 students. If we divide the number of students (177) by the number of lapses (61), we get an average of approximately 2.93 students per lapse. Therefore, more than half of the students (50%) were in the program if at least 2.93 students were in each lapse. So, the answer is greater than or equal to 50%.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between two dates. We can do this by subtracting one date from another. In this case, we have:

Date 1: 919 jalga (September 25) - Date 2: 1307 jalga (January 14) = 388 days
Therefore, if Koobas starts his journey on September 25 and travels for 388 days, he will reach Nad's location on January 14."
Response:  We have 849 koopas and we need to know how many will be left after 17 of them jump over the wall. So let's calculate it:  If 17 koopas jump over the wall, then there will be 832 (849 - 17) koopas left behind.
Response:  We have 659 balls in total and each ball has a volume of 0.01 cubic meters. Therefore, we can calculate the total volume of all the balls as follows: Volume = Number of balls x Volume per ball = 659 x 0.01 = 6.59 cubic meters Now, let's find out how much more or less there is compared to the capacity of the container. The capacity of the container is 762 cubic meters, so we need to subtract the volume of the balls from the capacity of the container: Capacity of container - Total volume of balls = 762 - 6.59 = 755.41 cubic meters There are still some balls left over after filling the container to its capacity, so the answer is 755.41 cubic meters.
Response:  We know that Paige has grown from 8 to 14 kuldkalas. Now we need to find out how many more kuldkalas she will have if she continues growing at the same rate as before. To do this, we can use the formula: New amount = Old amount + Growth rate x Time. In this case, the old amount is 8 and the growth rate is 6 (the difference between her current size of 14 and her original size of 8). So, if she continues growing at this rate for one year, she will have an additional 6 kuldkalas, bringing her total up to 20. Therefore, if she continues growing at this rate, she will have 20 kuldkalas in one year.
"Response:  We know that Paige had 7 candy canes and 12 cookies. If she gave some away, let's say 5 candy canes and 8 cookies, then we have:

Candy canes left = 7 - 5 = 2
Cookies left = 12 - 8 = 4
So, in total, Paige has 2 candy canes and 4 cookies left."
Response:  We have 16 black crows and 71 white swans. If we assume that each crow can eat half as much food as a swan, then...
Response:  We know that Paige has 15 kuldkalas and she likes to collect them. She has already collected 10 of them. So, there are still 5 more kuldkalas left for her to collect. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If there were 43 units of oil and we used half of it (21.5 units), then we have 21.5 - 43 = -21.5 units left. So, we have negative 21.5 units of oil left.
"Response:  We know that Kokil had 58 years and after he started using pirkaids, he had used 35 of them. So, we can calculate how many years have passed since Kokil started using pirkaids as follows:
Years passed = Total age - Age at start of use of pirkaids
= 58 - 35
= 23 years
Therefore, the number of years that have passed since Kokil started using pirkaids is 23 years."
Response:  We know that Kokil had 40 eggs and 54 chickens. After selling some of them, he had 39 ducks left. So, we can calculate how many eggs were sold as follows: Number of eggs = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs after selling ducks = 40 - 39 = 1 egg. Therefore, one egg was sold.
Response:  We have 11 questions and each question has 4 options. So, we need to calculate the total number of possible answers as follows:  Total no. of questions = 11 x Number of options per question = 11 x 4 = 44. Therefore, there are 44 possible answers for the given set of questions.
Response:  We know that there are 10 questions and 8 options for each question. So, we have 10 x 8 = 80 possibilities in total. Therefore, the probability of getting any particular option correct is 80/10 = 8.
"Response:  We have 8 small figures and 10 big figures. The theme is related to four colors. If we count how many times each color appears in both sets of figures, we get:

* Small figures: Red - 2, Blue - 3, Green - 2, Yellow - 1
* Big figures: Red - 4, Blue - 5, Green - 3, Yellow - 2

So, there are more red and blue figures than any other color."
"Response:  If Igas has 544 points and each point is equal to 32 lillies, then we can calculate how many lilies are in total as follows:

544 points x 32 lillies/point = 17,064 lillies

So there are 17,064 lilies if Igas has 544 points."
Response:  We have 466 potties and each potty contains 53 liters of water. So, we have total amount of water in liters = 466 x 53 = 24906 liters. Now, let's find out how much seal is required to cover all the water. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of water with number of seals (littles + pulks). So, number of seals = Total amount of water / Number of little + Number of pulk. In this case, number of seals = 24906 / 181 + 53 = 175. Therefore, there are 175 seals needed to cover all the water.
Response:  We know that Igas has 71 lillies and 91 pucks. So, if we subtract the number of lilies from the total amount of money (141), we get: 141 - 71 = 70. Therefore, there are 70 pucks.
Response:  If Igas has 40 liters of water and he gives 400 liters to Kokku, then Igas will have (40 - 400) = -360 liters left. So, the amount of water that Igas has is -360 liters.
Response:  We have 4502 skittles and 4276 tastes to taste them. If we want to know how many groups of 154 skittles there are, we can use division. So, if we divide 4502 by 154, we get... (insert calculation)...and there are approximately 30 groups of 154 skittles!
Response:  If there are 3941 skittles and each bag contains 495 skittles, then the total number of bags is: 3941 / 495 = 7.82 bags. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 bags. Therefore, if there are 4950 kustutust (candy pieces), then the number of groups of candy pieces in each bag is: 4950 / 8 = 612.5 groups per bag.
Response:  We have 896 Skittles in total and each bag contains 517 candies. If we divide the total number of Skittles into groups of 8, then how many groups can we make?  Therefore, there are 8 groups.
Response:  If there are 270 students in the school and 5 of them are in the same class, then we can assume that each class has an equal number of students. So if one class has x students, all classes together have 270 - 5 = 265 students. Therefore, the total number of students is 265.
Response:  We have 304 students in class 75 and 200 of them are good at math. So, we can say that 62% (or 200/304) of the students are good at math.
