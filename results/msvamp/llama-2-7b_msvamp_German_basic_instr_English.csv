Explanation: According to the passage, Bobby had eaten some sweets before he ate 25 more. This means that he had eaten a total of 17 sweets at the beginning."
"Response: 90
Explanation: The question states that Bobby has eaten 28 pieces of candy initially and then he has eaten 42 more pieces of candy after that, which means he has eaten a total of 70 pieces of candy (28 + 42 = 70). Additionally, the question states that Bobby has also eaten 63 pieces of chocolate, but this does not affect the number of candies he has eaten. Therefore, the final answer is 90 (70 + 63)"

"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then 36 more pieces, for a total of 74 pieces of candy. He also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 58 more pieces of candy than he has eaten of chocolate (74 - 16 = 58)."
"Response: 34 + 18 = 52
Bobby has eaten 52 pieces of candy."
"Response: 7
Explanation: The information given in the question is as follows:
Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially.
He ate 5 pieces of candy, leaving him with 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy.
Then he ate another 9 pieces of candy, leaving him with 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy.
Therefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left."
"Response: 14
Explanation: The problem states that Bobby had 22 pieces of candy at first and then he ate some. Let's assume he ate x pieces. Then, we know that after eating x pieces, he has 22 - x pieces left. Since he has 8 pieces left, we can set up the equation: 22 = x + 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, Bobby ate 14 pieces of candy at first."
"Response: 17
Explanation: The question states that Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he has eaten 2 pieces. Therefore, he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left."
Response: 12 (32 - 20 = 12)
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Bobby had 36 pieces of candy at first.
* He ate 17 pieces and then had 15 left.
* So, he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy left.
Therefore, Bobby has 10 pieces of candy left."

"Response: 12 - 9 = 3
Explanation: The original number of action figures was 5, and the total number of books was 9. Later, Jerry added 7 more action figures, so there are now 12 action figures (including the initial 5) and 9 books. Subtracting the number of books from the total number of action figures gives us the answer of 3 more action figures than books."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures, so there were now 6 action figures (2 initial + 4 new) and still 10 books. Therefore, the number of books more than action figures was 6."
Response: 18 (8 + 9 + 10 = 18)
"Response: 5

Response: 10 action figures were overall on Jerry's shelf.
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures and removed some of the old ones. If there are now 6 action figures on the shelf, that means he has 6 - 3 = 3 action figures left from the initial collection. Therefore, he has removed 2 action figures from the shelf."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Jerry had 7 action figures initially and later added some more, removing 10 of the old ones. This means that he has added 5 new action figures (7 - 10 = 5)."

Explanation: According to the question, Jerry added 2 new action figures and removed 7 old ones from his shelf. This means that he initially had 3 action figures (the original 2 plus the one he added later) on his shelf."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf initially and later added 7 more. This means that he has a total of 16 action figures (9 + 7). However, the question also states that Jerry has 10 books on his shelf, which is a fixed number. Therefore, we can conclude that there are 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf (16 - 10 = 3)."

Response: 37 pages (first chapter has 48 - 11 = 37 pages more than second chapter)
Response: 43 pages (80 - 37 = 43)
Response: 33 pages
"Response: 19 pages
Explanation: Let's assume that the book has x pages in total. Since the second chapter has y pages (where y = 36), we can write the equation: x + y = 67. Now, since there are two chapters, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get: 2x + 2y = 134. Subtracting 2y from both sides gives us: 2x = 117. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 58. Therefore, the first chapter has 58 pages."

Response: 9 (Camper)
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, 15 campers went rowing in the morning and some other campers went rowing in the afternoon. Since there were a total of 32 campers who went rowing that day, this means that 16 campers (15 + x) went rowing in the afternoon, where x is the number of additional campers who went rowing after lunchtime."
"Response: 12 camper(s)
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, some campers went rowing in the morning and 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. If a total of 60 campers went rowing that day, then the number of campers who went rowing in the morning is equal to the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon minus 7 (since 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon).

Response: 5 Äpfel (2 existing + 4 picked up + 3 new)
"Response: 60
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Rachel had initially 52 apple trees and picked 2 apples from one of them. This means that the remaining tree had 52 - 2 = 50 apples. Now, if she has taken 1 apple from each of the remaining 50 trees, there are 50 - 50 = 0 apples left on those trees. Therefore, the original number of apples on each tree was 50."
"Response: 24
Explanation: If Rachel has 3 apple trees and each tree has 8 apples, then she has picked a total of 3 x 8 = 24 apples from all the trees together. Since there are still 9 apples left on the trees after she has picked some, that means there were originally 24 + 9 = 33 apples on all the trees combined."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel has picked 7 apples from each of her 4 apple trees, for a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. Additionally, there were originally 29 apples hanging from the trees, so the total number of apples Rachel has picked is 28 + 29 = 57 apples."

Response: 9 tassen mehl (3 + 6 = 9)
"Response: 4 tassen Mehl
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 3 tassen Mehl and 62 tassen Zucker. To find out how many additional tassen Mehl she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of meal she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 tassen Mehl, so if Mary has already added 3 tassen Mehl, she still needs to add an additional 6 tassen Mehl (9 - 3 = 6)."
Response: 12 Tassen Zucker (or 12 cups of sugar)
"Response: 1
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 11 tanks of meal, which means she needs to add 1 more tank of meal to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 1."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 7 tbsp of meal (which is equal to 3/4 cup) and the recipe requires 10 tbsp of meal. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 3 tbsp of meal (equal to 1/4 cup)."
"Response: 5 tassen (Mehr als)
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of meal, which is equal to 30 grams. The recipe requires 12 times as much meal as salt, so she needs to add 12 x 30 = 360 grams of meal. Since there are 30 grams in each tablespoon, she needs to add 360 / 30 = 12 tablespoons or 5 cups of meal. Therefore, Mary must add 5 more cups of meal than she added cups of salt."
"Response: 3 Tassen Zucker
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 5 Tassen Mehl (which is equal to 125 g) and needs to add 3 Tassen Zucker (which is equal to 400 g). Therefore, she needs to add an additional 225 g of sugar."
"Response: 11 tassen (Zucker)
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of sugar, which is equal to 1/4 cup or 11 tablespoons. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 11 tablespoons of sugar to fulfill the recipe's requirement of 13 tablespoons."
Response: 3 tbsp (tablespoons) of meal.
"Response: 7 tassen mehl
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of flour (Tasse = 15g), which means she needs to add an additional 7 tablespoons of flour (Tasse x Menge) = 7 x 15g = 105g more flour than the amount of sugar required in the recipe. Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 tablespoons of flour more than the number of tablespoons of sugar required in the recipe."
"Response: 4 tassen Zucker (Z)
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 11 tassen Mehl (M), and the recipe requires 5 tassen Zucker (Z). Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more tassen Zucker (Z = M - 5 + 4 = 9)."

"Response: 36 tassen mehl
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 4 tablespoons of flour (Tassen = 36), and the recipe requires 9 tablespoons of sugar (Tassen = 9). Therefore, she needs to add an additional 57 tablespoons of flour (Tassen = 57) to have more than 9 tablespoons of flour than sugar."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of meal (Tassen = 16 teaspoons), which is less than the amount of salt required (4 tablespoons). Therefore, she needs to add an additional 3 tablespoons of meal (or 3 x 16 = 48 teaspoons) to meet the requirement."
"Response: 5 tassen Zucker
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added 12 tassen Mehl more than required. To find out how many tassen Zucker she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of meal she added from the total amount of meal required in the recipe. The difference between 11 and 17 (the number of tassen Mehl needed minus the amount she added) is equal to 5 tassen Zucker. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 tassen Zucker to the recipe."

Response: 4 tassen (Mehl) more than sugar (Zucker).
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 19 bird families that live near the mountain. If 60 of these families migrate for the winter, then the number of families that remain behind is 19 - 60 = -41. Therefore, there are more birds that have left than those that have remained, which answers the question with a value of 31 (the absolute value of -41)."
"Response: 79
Explanation: If 7 bird families have migrated for the winter and there are 87 bird families total, then the number of bird families remaining behind is equal to 87 minus 7 = 79."
Response: 56 (twice 28)
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the passage, 85 bird families live near the mountain. If 23 bird families have migrated to Africa and 37 bird families have migrated to Asia, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is:

85 - 23 = 62
62 - 37 = 25
Therefore, there are 25 bird families still living near the mountain."
"Response: 42 - 31 = 11
There are 11 bird families that have migrated to Africa more than those who have migrated to Asia."
"Response: 50 (more)
Explanation: According to the passage, 94 bird families have migrated to Asia, which is more than the 47 bird families that have migrated to Africa. Therefore, there are 50 more bird families that have migrated to Asia than to Africa."
"Response: 24 (6 + 18)
Explanation: The total number of bird families that have migrated for the winter is equal to the sum of those that have gone to Africa and Asia. Therefore, there are 24 bird families that have migrated for the winter."
"Response: 105
Explanation: According to the passage, there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 18 new bird families arrive, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is 87 + 18 = 105."
"Response: 49 - (59 + 24) = 49 - 83 = 0
Explanation: According to the passage, 59 bird families have migrated away for the winter and 24 new bird families have arrived from the Arctic. Since there were originally 49 bird families living near the mountain, and none of them left, we can conclude that all 49 original families are still present."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the passage, 27 bird families migrated away from the mountain as winter approached. This means that there were initially 41 bird families living near the mountain (since 27 - 27 = 0). Therefore, only 3 bird families remained in the area by the time winter arrived."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the passage, 86 bird families migrated from the nearby mountain to escape winter. This means that initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. Therefore, more birds have migrated away than remained behind, which is 41 bird families."
"Response: 62 - 35 = 27
There are 27 more bird families that have migrated to Africa than to Asia."
"Response: 28
Explanation:
The original 3 bird families that lived near the mountain before winter are still there (A, B, and C). Of the new birds that came from the arctic to live nearby, 26 belong to family D. However, families E and F have migrated south for the winter, leaving only 2 families (D and G) remaining near the mountain. Therefore, there are 28 bird families left near the mountain after the migration."
"Response: 183
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 253 buntstiften at the beginning of his birthday celebrations and lost or gave away 70 of them by the end of the school year. Therefore, he had 183 buntstiften left at the end of the school year."
Response: 204 sticks (of course)
"Response: 23
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul received 440 buntstiften for his birthday and gave away 111 during the school year. This means he had 329 buntstiften left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he lost 106 buntstiften, leaving him with 23 buntstiften (329 - 106 = 23)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 65 crayons for his birthday and gave away 213 during the school year. This means that he lost 16 crayons or gave them away as gifts."
"Response: 108
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 571 buntstiften during the school year and lost 161 buntstiften. Therefore, he had 571 - 161 = 410 buntstiften left at the end of the school year. Since his friends received 589 buntstiften in total (including the initial 589 plus the ones he gave away), he must have given more buntstiften to his friends than he lost. So, the difference between the number of buntstiften he gave away and the number he lost is equal to the number of buntstiften he gave to his friends minus the number he lost, which is 410 - 161 = 250 buntstiften."
"Response: 318
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 90 buntstifts during the school year and lost 412 buntstifts in total. Therefore, he has more buntstifts than he gave away by 318 (412 - 90)."
"Response: 107
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 563 Buntstifte during the school year and lost 558 Buntstifte, leaving him with 332 Buntstifte remaining. Therefore, he received 107 Buntstifte for his birthday (the difference between the number of Buntstifte he had at the beginning of the school year and the number he had left after giving them away)."
"Response: 67 (or 68)
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away or lost 535 Buntstifte during the school year. This means that he had 500 Buntstifte at first (since he received 50 as a gift). Then, he lost/gave away 535 - 50 = 67 (or 68) Buntstifte. Therefore, he has only 492 Buntstifte left."
Response: 387 (521 - 154 = 387)
"Response: 240
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul received a box of 531 buntstifts and 38 radiergummies for his birthday.
* At the end of the school year, he had 391 buntstifts left without losing any.
* This means that he lost some buntstifs, but not all of them. Let's assume that he lost x buntstifts.
* Since he didn't lose any radiergummies, he still has 38 of them.

Now, let's calculate the number of buntstifts Paul had more than radiergummies at the end of the school year:

Number of buntstifts = 391 - x

Since x is the number of buntstifts Paul lost, we can write:
x = 531 - 391 = 140

So, Paul had 140 buntstifts more than radiergummies at the end of the school year."
"Response: 79
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul received a box with 601 buntstifts and 406 radiergummies for his birthday.
* At the end of the school year, he had 336 radiergummies left without losing any.

Now, let's find out how many radiergummies Paul had more than buntstifts:

Total number of radiergummies = 406
Number of buntstifts = 601

Subtracting the total number of buntstifts from the initial number of radiergummies gives us the number of radiergummies Paul had more than buntstifts:

79 (radiergummies) - 601 (buntstifts) = 79

Therefore, Paul had 79 radiergummies more than buntstifts at the end of the school year."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 34 buntsticks for his birthday. This is calculated by subtracting the number of sticks he lost or gave away (291) from the total number of sticks he had at the end of the school year (315)."
"Response: 75
Explanation: According to the question, Paul lost 231 buntstifte during the school year and gave away 308 buntstifte to his friends. Therefore, he has more buntstifte than he lost by 75 (308 - 231 = 75)."
"Response: 168
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 320 buntstiften at the beginning of the school year and received 457 radiergummis as a gift for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 523 items left over, which means that he lost 94 radiergummis (457 - 523 = -94). Since he did not lose any buntstiften, he must have had more than 320 buntstiften at the beginning of the school year, since he ended up with 168 more than he started with (-94 + 320 = 168)."
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, initially the kellner had 11 customers. After some of them left, he was left with 3 customers. To find out how many more customers left than remained, we need to subtract the number of remaining customers from the initial number of customers. In this case, 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, 8 more customers left than remained."
"Response: 1
Explanation: The kellner had 3 customers initially and after some of them left, he still had 4 customers remaining. Therefore, more customers remained behind than those who went away."
Response: 3 (the number of customers the kellner had at the beginning)
"Response: 9
Explanation: The kellner had initially 14 customers, and 5 of them have left, leaving him with 9 customers."
Response: 5 customers have gone (13 - 9 = 4 + 5).
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The kellner had 12 customers initially.
* 15 customers left, so he lost 3 customers (15 - 12 = 3).
* He gained 14 new customers, so he gained 14 - 3 = 11 new customers.

Therefore, the kellner has 10 + 11 = 21 customers now."
Response: 5 new customers have arrived (8 - 3 = 5).
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the problem statement, the initial number of customers was 8, and after some customers left, there were still 5 customers remaining. Then, 99 new customers arrived, which means that 92 (99 - 8) customers had gone. Therefore, 3 customers went away initially."
"Response: 26
Explanation: The initial number of customers was 12, and some left, leaving him with 14. Then, he got 10 new customers, so now he has 26 customers in total."
Response: 5 dollars (Dan had originally $5).
"Response: 1 dollar
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $3 dollars left after buying a chocolate bar. If he spent $1 dollar on the chocolate bar, then he has $2 dollars left ($3 - $1 = $2)."
Response: 2 dollars (Dan has $4 - ($99 x $3))
Response: 6 dollars 
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Dan spent $18 (3 x $6) on the chocolate bars. Since he had only $2 initially, this means that he bought 4 chocolate bars ($18 / $3 = 4)."
Response: 2 dollars (Dan has $7 - $2 = $5 left)
Response: 13 dollars (7 + 6)
"Response: 4 dollars 
Explanation: To calculate how much money Dan spent on each chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of one chocolate from the total amount he spent. For the chocolate bar, Dan spent $6 - $3 = $3. For the chocolate chip cookie, Dan spent $4 (since it costs $6 - $3 = $4 more than the chocolate bar). Therefore, Dan spent $4 to buy the chocolate chip cookie in comparison to the chocolate bar."
"Response: 5 - 2 = 3 dollars
Explanation: The total amount of money that Dan spent is $5 (the initial amount he had). He spent $2 on a chocolate bar and $3 on a chocolate. Therefore, the difference in cost between the two items is $3 ($3 - $2 = $1)."
Response: 2 dollars (Dan has $4 - $8 = $2 left)
"Response: 1$
Explanation: According to the question, Dan had $4 at first and spent $3 on a chocolate bar. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate bar is $3."
Response: 1 dollar (Dan has $4 and spent $3 for 10 chocolate bars, so he has $4 - $3 = $1 left).
Response: 1 Dollar.
Response: 4 dollars 
"Response: 7 - 2 = 5 dollars
Dan has spent $5 more on the chocolate bar than he did on the chocolate-covered pretzel."

"Response: 73
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 108 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After giving 35 books to his friend, he was left with 62 books. Therefore, he must have sold 73 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 101
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 50 books initially and bought some more at a flea market. The total number of books he had after buying some is 151 - 50 = 101."
"Response: 72
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them at a flea market. After buying new books, he now has 58 books in total. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he had initially (2) from the total number of books he has now (58): 58 - 2 = 56. Therefore, Paul sold 56 books at the flea market."
Response: 27 (Paul has sold more books than he has bought)
Response: 49 (Paul has bought more books than he sold)
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul had initially 108 books and 55 stifts. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 stiffs. This means that he sold 42 books (108 - 66 = 42) at the garage sale."
"Response: 34 stifte
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books and stifts at a garage sale, Paul had 82 books and 14 stifts left. If he sold some stifts at the garage sale, then he must have had more than 14 stifts originally. Let's assume that he sold x stifts at the garage sale. Then, we can set up the equation: 106 - x = 82. Solving for x, we get x = 34. Therefore, Paul sold 34 stifts at the garage sale."
"Response: 109
Explanation: Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many books Paul has sold. We know that he had initially 136 books and that he sold some of them at a garage sale. The question states that he has now 27 books left, which means that he must have sold 109 books (136 - 27 = 109)."
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul had 134 books and gave 39 of them to his friend. This means he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, it says that he sold some books at a flea market, which means he has fewer books left than before. Let's assume he sold x books at the flea market. Since he already gave away 39 books, this means he has 95 - 39 = 56 books left. Therefore, he sold 56 books at the flea market."
"Response: 60 books
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul had 95 stifles and 153 books before selling some of them at a garage sale. If he sold 60 books at the garage sale, that means he has 95 - 60 = 35 books left. Similarly, if he sold 23 stiftes at the garage sale, that means he has 153 - 23 = 130 books left. Therefore, Paul sold 60 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul had 42 stiften and 143 books before selling some of them at a garage sale. After the sale, he had 113 books and 19 stiften left. To find out how many stiften he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of stiften he had after the sale from the total number of stiften he had initially. In this case, that would be 42 - 19 = 23 stiften. So, Paul sold 23 stiften at the garage sale."

"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the passage, Jessica threw away 34 roses and cut some new ones from her garden to put in the vase. This means she had 34 - 3 = 31 new roses in the vase after she added them. Since there were originally 21 roses in the vase, the total number of roses now is 31 + 21 = 52. Therefore, Jessica threw away more roses than she cut from her garden."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the information provided, there were originally 7 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some more from her garden that had 59 roses in total. So, she must have cut 39 roses (59 - 20 = 39)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the information provided, there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some from her garden that had 12 roses in total. This means that she cut 1 rose from her garden. Therefore, there are still 9 roses left in her garden."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the passage, there were originally 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. This means that she added 11 more roses (15 + 11 = 26) and 40 more orchids (62 + 40 = 102) to the vase, for a total of 17 roses and 96 orchids. Therefore, Jessica cut 11 roses."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, so now there are 10 roses in the vase.

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the passage, there were initially 3 Orchideen and 16 Rosen in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, bringing the total number of roses to 13. However, since it is mentioned that she has ""still"" some orchids left, we can infer that she did not cut any orchids. Therefore, the number of orchids she cut must be equal to the initial number of orchids, which is 3. So, the answer is 4."
"Response: 22 - 6 = 16
Explanation: There were originally 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, making the total number of roses 22. However, there are still 20 orchids in the vase. Therefore, there are 16 more roses than orchids in the vase now."

"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 Flaschenverschlüsse and 46 Verpackungen in the park. Now he has 21 Flaschenverschlüsse and 52 Verpackungen in his collection. To find out how many more Flaschenverschlüsse than Verpackungen Danny found in the park, we subtract the number of Verpackungen from the number of Flaschenverschlüsse: 50 - 46 = 4. Therefore, Danny found 4 more Flaschenverschlüsse than Verpackungen in the park."
"Response: 44
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 65 Verpackungen and 5 Flaschenverschlüsse in the park. Now he has 31 Flaschenverschlüsse and 9 Verpackungen in his collection. To find out how many more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of Flaschenverschlüsse from the total number of items found: 65 - 5 = 60. So, Danny found 44 more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse in the park."
"Response: 43
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 58 Flaschenverschlüsse and found 25 more in the park. Therefore, he now has 58 + 25 = 83 Flaschenverschlüsse.

Explanation: According to the passage, Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. The passage states that she has 252 cards left after giving some to Jeff, which means she must have given him 306 cards (528 - 252 = 306)."
"Response: 311
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. After giving some away, she has 535 cards left. To find out how many cards Jeff now has, we can subtract the number of cards he received from the total number of cards Nell had before giving any away. So, Jeff has 311 cards (566 - 234 = 311)."
"Response: 276
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 10-card sets before giving some of her cards away to Jeff. After giving cards away, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 10-card sets. This means that Nell gave away 309 - 149 = 160 baseball cards.

* The baker had 62 kuchens initially.
* He then made 149 additional kuchens.
* He sold 144 of them.

So, the number of kuchens the baker has left is:

211 - 144 = 67
Therefore, the baker has 8 kuchens left."

Explanation: According to the question, the baker has made 84 kuchens and 52 gebackstuescles. If he sold 102 kuchens and 94gebackstuescles, then he must have had more kuchens than gebackstuescles left over.

"Response: 170
Explanation: According to the passage, Der Razorback Shop earned $86 per T-shirt and $232 per jersey. Since they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, we can calculate the price difference between a T-shirt and a jersey as follows:
T-shirt price = $86 x 254 = $21,960
Jersey price = $232 x 43 = $9,666
Therefore, a jersey is $12,304 more expensive than a T-shirt ($9,666 - $21,960)."

"Response: 56 dollars
Explanation: According to the passage, the cost of a T-shirt is $240 and the cost of a trikit is $210. Since they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 trikots during the game, we can set up the equation: T-shirt price = Trikit price x Sold T-shirts / Sold trikots. Substituting the values given in the passage, we get: T-shirt price = $210 x 177 / 23 = $56. Therefore, one T-shirt costs $56 more than one trikit."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Der Razorback Shop earned $115 per trikit and $25 per T-shirt. If they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 trikots during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, then the total revenue from T-shirts is $2925 (113 x $25) and the total revenue from trikots is $2675 ($115 x 22). To find out how much more expensive a trikit is than a T-shirt, we can subtract the revenue from T-shirts from the revenue from trikots: $2675 - $2925 = -$250. Therefore, a trikit is $250 more expensive than a T-shirt."

Explanation: According to the passage, Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total, and only 58 seedlings grew in each of the 12 beets they had planted. Therefore, there were 4 beets in total (12 x 58 = 640)."
"Response: 90
Explanation:
Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total. They laid 15 seeds in each of the 3 beets. Since only 60 seeds grew in each beet, they will have 60/15 = 4 seedlings per beet. Therefore, they will have 55 x 4 = 220 seedlings in total."

Response: 22 (Matthew had 2 keks for each of his 11 friends, so he had 2 x 11 = 22 keks in total).
Response: 4 (Matthew gave away 8 keks to 4 friends)
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 15 crackers and gave them equally among his 5 friends. This means each friend received 15/5 = 3 crackers. Since Matthew still has 10 crackers left after giving them away, this implies that each friend ate 3 + 10 = 13 crackers in total."
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers (i.e., 8) to each of his three friends. This means that he had 24 - 8 = 16 crackers left after giving them away."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies and gave each of his 11 friends equal amounts, then each friend would have received 22/11 = 5 crackers and 34/11 = 3 cookies. Therefore, each person has eaten 5 crackers."
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cookies. If he gave his two friends equal amounts of crackers and cookies, then each friend would have received 29/2 = 14.5 crackers and 30/2 = 15 cookies. Therefore, each person has eaten 15 cookies."
Response: 35 (Kekse + Kuchen)
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his 18 friends an equal number of crackers. If he had 36 crackers in total and gave them out equally among his friends, then each friend would have eaten 2 crackers (since there are 18 friends)."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his friends 6 kekes. If he had 36 kekse in total, then he must have given them to 6 friends."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 23 crackers and gave some to his friends. After giving them away, he had 11 crackers left. If he gave each friend an equal amount of crackers (which is what it says in the question), then each friend ate 4 crackers (since there are 23 / 2 = 11 crackers left after they ate their share)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 31 crackers and gave each of his 5 friends an equal number of crackers (i.e., 31 / 5 = 6). Therefore, he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 crackers to his friends. Since he still has 23 crackers left after giving them away, the answer is 30."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his four friends an equal number of crackers and cake. If he had initially 32 crackers and 98 cakes, then he must have given each friend 32/4 = 8 crackers and 98/4 = 24 cakes. Therefore, each person has eaten 8/4 = 2 crackers."
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his four friends an equal number of crackers and cookies. If he had initially 10 crackers and 8 cookies, then each friend would have received 5 crackers (since there are 4 friends) and 3 cookies (since there were originally 8 cookies). Therefore, each person would have eaten 2 cookies."
"Response: 4/7 of each (Crackers and Cake) were eaten by each friend. So, if there are 28 friends in total, then:
Number of crackers eaten = 4/7 x 28 = 19
Number of cakes eaten = 4/7 x 28 = 16
Therefore, each person ate 19/28 or approximately 0.67 crackers and 16/28 or approximately 0.57 cakes."

Explanation: According to the passage, there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question, and 295 visitors the previous day. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on the two days is:
317 - 295 = 22
So, 22 more people visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day."
"Response: 2891
Explanation: If 703 people visited the Buckingham Palace on one day and 246 people visited it within 25 days, then the average number of visitors per day is:

"Response: 384
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and Michael had their hearty meal. If we multiply this number by 327 (the total number of days), we get 41,940 visitors to the palace over that period. Dividing this number by 406 (the total number of visitors per day) gives us 384 visitors on the previous day."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends had their hearty meal."

* After they had eaten a hearty meal, they went to the Buckingham Palace.
* There were 71 paintings at the palace.
* Rachel learned that on this day, 557 people visited the Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many people visited the palace within 57 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the first day from the total number of visitors on the last day:

557 - 188 = 329

Therefore, within 57 days, 329 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
"Response: 66 - 600 = 661
Explanation: If there were 600 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 661 visitors on the current day, then the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of additional visitors who came to the palace on that day compared to the previous day. Therefore, the correct answer is 661 - 600 = 66."
"Response: 92 - 419 = -337
Explanation: The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question is given as 92. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before this day is 419 + 103 = 522. Therefore, the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace before this day is 522 - 92 = 430."
"Response: 363
Explanation: According to the information provided, there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and Michael had their hearty meal.

Explanation:
The information provided is that 266 pickers will fill 90 barrels in 5 days. To calculate how many barrels are filled per day, we need to divide the total number of barrels by the number of days available for filling them. In this case, there are 5 days available for filling barrels, so we can calculate the daily output as follows:
Number of barrels filled per day = Total number of barrels / Number of days available for filling
= 90 / 5
= 3.67 barrels per day (approximately)"
