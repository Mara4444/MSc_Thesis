Question: İki sepet şeftali var. Her sepede 4 kırmızı şeftali ve biraz daha yeşil şeftali var. Eğer tüm sepetlerde toplamda 12 şeftali varsa her bir sepette kaç tane yeşil şeftali var?  
Answer: Let's assume that the number of green balls in each urn is x. Since there are 3 red balls in each urn, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 3x = 12 (total number of balls)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 12

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 6

So, there are 6 green balls in each urn."

"Response: 9
Explanation:
Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books initially. When he added 4 more books to his collection, there were now 11 action figures (7 original + 4 new) and 6 books (2 original + 4 new). Therefore, there are 9 action figures in total (7 original + 2 new) and 6 books in total (6 original + 0 new)."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 4 action figures in Jerry's room. Then, two more action figures were added and another seven were taken away. If there are currently 10 action figures in the room, that means five of them were already present before any changes were made (the initial four plus one additional)."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
The original 9 action figures in Jerry's room are still there, so there are 9 action figures in total. When Jerry added 7 more action figures, the total number of action figures increased to 16 (9 + 7). If there were 10 books in Jerry's room, and each book has 4 pages, then the total number of pages in the books is 40 (10 x 4). Since there are now 16 action figures in Jerry's room, and each action figure takes up 1 page, there are 16 pages left over for the books after accounting for the action figures (40 - 16 = 24). Therefore, there are 3 extra pages left over for the books after adding the new action figures."
"Response: 5

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* There are 3 books and 4 action figures in Jerry's room.

"Response: 40

Explanation:
The first book has 91 pages, the second book has 23 pages, and the third book has 25 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the first book and the number of pages in the second book is:
91 - 23 = 68 pages.
Similarly, the difference between the number of pages in the second book and the number of books is:
23 - 25 = -2 pages.
So, there are 40 pages difference between the first book and the third book."
"Response: 20

Explanation:
The first book has 35 pages in the first section, 18 pages in the second section, and 3 pages in the third section. Therefore, there are 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages in the entire book. Since the second section has fewer pages than the first section by 18 - 3 = 15 pages, there are 66 - 15 = 51 pages between the two sections."
"Response: 40

Explanation:
The first book has 53 pages, the second book has 75 pages, and the third book has 21 pages. To find out how many pages the third book is shorter than the second book, we can subtract the number of pages in the third book from the number of pages in the second book:

75 - 21 = 54

So, the third book is 54 pages shorter than the second book."

Therefore, there are 66 - 29 = 37 kampçıs left who did not complete their journey yet. Since 26 kampçıs started after noon, they have not yet begun their journey, so the remaining kampçıs who have not started their journey yet are 37 + 26 = 63 kampçıs."
"Response: 35
Explanation:
The total number of kampçıs = 41 + 4 = 45
After 26 kampçıs went to school, there were 45 - 26 = 19 kampçıs left at home.

"Response: 150
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, 23 dollars are earned from each razorback tişört sold at the store. Therefore, if 230 dollars were earned from selling tişorts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech match, it means that 150 tişorts were sold (230 / 23 = 150)."
Response:  $12.20
"Response:  $162

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is given by the equation:

Total Amount = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt
= 95 x $87
= $8325

Since Arkansas won 47 matches out of 95, the number of t-shirts sold for each match is:

Number of T-Shirts Sold = Total Number of Matches / Number of Wins
= 95 / 47
= 2

Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during an Arkansas match is:

Amount of Money Earnt = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt
= 2 x $87
= $174

So, the Razorbacks earned $174 for each match they won."
"Response: 37

Explanation:
The total number of shirts sold by the Razorback tişört dükkanı is given as $106. If Arkansas sold 115 shirts in their game, then the number of shirts sold by Texas Tech can be calculated as follows:

Number of shirts sold by Texas Tech = Total number of shirts sold - Number of shirts sold by Arkansas
= $106 - 115
= -19

Therefore, Texas Tech sold 19 fewer shirts than the total number of shirts sold by the Razorback tişört dükkanı."
"Response:  $275

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts at Arkansas and Texas Tech games is given as $163. If Arkansas sold 89 t-shirts during their game, then the amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during that game alone is $89 x $98 = $8,612. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts at both games is $163 + $8,612 = $8,774."
"Response:  $340

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is given by the equation:
Total Amount = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt
In this case, the number of t-shirts sold at each game is given as follows:
Arkansas Game: 172 t-shirts sold
Texas Tech Game: 186 t-shirts sold
So, the total number of t-shirts sold is:
Total Number of T-Shirts = Arkansas Game + Texas Tech Game
= 172 + 186
= 358
Now, we need to find out how much each t-shirt was sold for. The price per t-shirt is given as $78. So, the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows:
Total Amount = Total Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt
= 358 x $78
= $2796
Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $2796 from selling t-shirts during both games."

$130 x $43 = $5300
So, the Razorbacks earned $5300 by selling t-shirts."
"Response:  $358

Explanation:

Response:  If Dean's height is 9 feet and he has a depth of 10 times that, then his depth would be 90 feet.
Response:  The depth of water in the pool after Dean and Ron have finished swimming is twice as deep as it was before they started swimming. Therefore, if the initial depth of the water in the pool was x meters, then the final depth will be 2x meters. Since Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron, the depth of the water where Dean dived will be x - 2 meters. Finally, since Ron can dive to a depth of 14 feet, the depth of the water where he dove will be 14 feet + (x - 2) = 16 feet.
Response:  The depth of water is 5 times the height of Ron. Since Ron is 3 meters shorter than Dean, the depth of water is 5 x (Dean - 3) = 5 x 9 = 45 meters deep.
Response:  The depth of the water is 15 times greater than Dean's height, which is 10 meters (or 32.8 feet). Therefore, the depth of the water is 15 x 10 = 150 meters (or 492.1 feet).
Response:  The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Since Ron is 9 feet tall, the depth of the water is 132 feet (16 x 9 = 132).
Response:  The depth of water is 9 times deeper than Ron's height and 6 times deeper than Dean's height. So, if Ron is 5 meters tall and Dean is 6 meters tall, then the depth of the water is 9 x 5 = 45 meters and 6 x 45 = 270 meters respectively.

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that out of 294 toplayıcıdan (tournament players), 244 played with 80% accuracy and 47 played with 53% accuracy. To find out how many players scored at least one point, we need to calculate the number of players who scored at least one point in both groups.

Response: 4 groups. Explanation: To determine how many groups Becky can form with 10 cups and 20 mermaids, we need to divide both quantities by the number of people in each group. In this case, since there are 4 people in each group, we can divide 10 cups by 4 to get 2.5 cups per person, and divide 20 mermaids by 4 to get 5 mermaids per person. Since you cannot have a fraction of a mermaid, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 mermaids per group. Therefore, Becky can form 4 groups of 6 mermaids each, or a total of 24 mermaids.
"Response: 6 groups. Explanation: To form 6 groups of 4 people each, you will need to distribute the 10 bags and 15 apples as follows: Group 1: 2 bags, 3 apples; Group 2: 2 bags, 3 apples; Group 3: 1 bag, 2 apples; Group 4: 1 bag, 2 apples; Group 5: 1 bag, 2 apples; Group 6: 1 bag, 2 apples."

"Response: 30 groups. Explanation: To determine how many groups can be formed with 18 yumurtas, 72 mus, and 66 mermaids, we need to divide these numbers by the number of people in each group. Let’s assume that each group consists of 4 people (1 yumuta, 1 musician, 1 mermaid). Therefore, we can form 30 groups (18 / 4 = 4.5 groups; rounding up to the nearest whole number)."
Response: 3 groups. Explanation: Since there are 99 musicians and 9 yurtas, each group can have at most 10 musicians (since there are only 9 yurtas). Therefore, we can form 3 groups of size 10 each. Similarly, since there are 27 mermaids, each group can have at most 9 mermaids (since there are only 27 in total), so we can form 3 groups of size 9 each.

Explanation:
Adam has placed 11 action figures on each of the 4 pillows in his room, so there are a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in the room. Since there are 4 pillows and 40 dolls in the room, we can deduce that there are 44 - 40 = 4 action figures left over after placing all the dolls on their respective pillows. Therefore, there are 4 action figures remaining in the room."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
Adam has 10 fingers and can place one action figure on each finger. Therefore, he can have a total of 10 action figures in his hand. Since Adam can hold 8 action figures at most, there are only 2 more action figures that he can hold beyond what is already in his hand. So, the number of action figures in Adam's hand is 10 - 8 = 2."

Since there are 8 action figures, each figure can have 2 balls (since each ball can be carried by two people), so there are 8 x 2 = 16 action figures that can carry balls.

"Response:  The number of groups of 154 pieces each that can be formed from 4276 silgis and 4502 Skittles is:

(4276 / 154) = 28

Therefore, there are 28 groups of 154 pieces each that can be formed from the given quantities of silgis and Skittles."
Response:  Each group of Silgis contains 4950/495 = 10 units. Therefore, each group of Skittles contains 3941 x 10 = 39410 units.
Response:  The number of groups of Skittles that can be formed is given by the equation: Number of Groups = Total Number of Skittles / Size of Each Group. In this case, the total number of Skittles is 896 and the size of each group is 517 (siligi) or 90 (ölçekli malı). Therefore, there are 896/517 = 1.74 or 896/90 = 9.95 groups of Skittles that can be formed.
