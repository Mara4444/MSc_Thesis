"Response: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
Explanation:
Rayan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. To calculate the difference in time spent between the two languages, we need to convert both times to minutes.

6 hours = 360 minutes (English)
2 hours = 120 minutes (Chinese)

Now, let's find out how many more minutes Rayan spends studying English than he does Chinese:
360 minutes - 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Therefore, Rayan spends 240 minutes more studying English than he does Chinese."
Response: 12 hours (7 + 5) 
Response: 2 hours. Explanation: According to the question, Rayan spends 3 hours studying English and 1 hour studying Chinese every day. If he spends a total of 4 hours studying languages per day, then he spends 2 hours studying Chinese.
Response: 4 hours. Explanation: According to the question, if Rayan spends 7 hours studying English every day and more than 2 hours studying Chinese per day, then he spends 9 hours (7 + 2) studying languages altogether. Therefore, he spends 4 hours less studying Chinese compared to English.
Response: 10 hours. Explanation: According to the question, if Rayan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and more than 2 hours extra in English, then he spends a total of 10 hours (5 + 2) hours per day on language learning.
Response:  The person spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. If they continue for 5 days, they will have studied a total of 30 hours (6 x 5 = 30) of English and 49 hours (7 x 5 = 49) of Chinese.

Response: 15 hours (7 + 7 + 3)
"Response: 104 
Explanation: According to the given information, Rayan spends 6 hours studying English every day, 3 hours studying Chinese, and 58 hours studying Spanish. To compare these times, we can convert all of them to the same unit of time (e.g., hours). Let's assume that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Then, we have:

* English: 6 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes per day
* Chinese: 3 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes per day
* Spanish: 58 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 3472 minutes per day

Now, let's calculate the difference between the total number of minutes spent on each language and express it in terms of hours:

English: 360 minutes/day - 360 minutes/day = 0 hours (no difference)
Chinese: 180 minutes/day - 180 minutes/day = 0 hours (no difference)
Spanish: 3472 minutes/day - 3472 minutes/day = 0 hours (no difference)

So, there is no difference in the amount of time spent on each language."
Response: 10 hours (7 + 2 + 4) = 13 hours.
Response: 10 hours. Explanation: According to the question, Rayan spends 2 hours learning English every day, which is equivalent to 10 hours per week. Therefore, if he spends 4 hours learning Spanish and 5 hours learning Chinese, it means that he spends more time learning Spanish than Chinese. So, the difference in time spent between learning Spanish and Chinese is 10 hours (4 hours - 5 hours).
Response: 180 minutes (or 3 hours)  Explanation: If Rayan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends 2 hours per day learning English. Therefore, he spends 180 minutes (or 3 hours) per day learning Chinese.
Response:  The person spends 16 hours (4 + 5) in learning English and Chinese every day. Therefore, they spend a total of 16 hours per day learning both languages.

From the given information, we know that there were initially 6 more bulbuls than dogs in the field. So, the total number of bulbuls was 6 + 7 = 13. Since each dog knocked down 7 gubbares, the total number of gubbares knocked down by all dogs was 13 x 7 = 91. Now, if Ed had 22 gubbares, then he has 22 - 91 = -69 gubbares left. Therefore, the number of gubbares left with Dog is 14 (69 - 55)."
"Response: 19
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there were initially 5 more bulbuls in Ed's garden than in Dog's garden. So, the total number of bulbuls in Ed's garden was 5 + 3 = 8.
Now, if Ed had 27 bulbuls in total, then he must have had 27 - 8 = 19 bulbuls in his garden at the start. Therefore, the number of bulbuls in Dog's garden at the start was 3."

"Response: 20 - 8 = 12

Explanation:
The given information can be summarized as follows:

* There were 19 dogs in the field before Ed played golf.
* Ed hit some balls into the water and lost 4 of them.
* After playing golf, there are 8 ducks in the field now.

So, the number of balls that Ed hit into the water is 4 (since he lost 4 balls). Therefore, the number of balls left with him after playing golf is 16 (19 - 4)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 30 goblars in his army before he attacked the Meadow of Goblins. After attacking, he lost 21 goblars.

"Response: 20
Explanation:
The total amount of rice that Mary has is 5 kg and she has already consumed 11 kg of it. So, the remaining amount of rice with her is 5 - 11 = 4 kg. To find out how many more bags of 14 kg each she needs to buy, we divide the remaining amount by the weight of one bag (14 kg). Therefore, the number of bags she needs is 4 kg / 14 kg = 28/14 = 20 bags."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Mary had already drunk 3 cups of tea before she started eating the noodles. Now, if she wants to drink another 5 cups of tea after finishing her meal, and each cup takes 10 minutes to prepare, then it will take her 5 x 10 = 50 minutes to prepare all the 5 cups of tea. Therefore, the time taken by Mary to prepare the remaining 5 cups of tea is 50 minutes."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Mary had already consumed some atta before answering the question. Therefore, the total amount of atta she needed was 13 - 4 = 9 cups. Since she had already consumed 4 cups of atta, she still needs 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of atta. So, Mary would need to consume 4.5 cups of atta."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate that Margi has already consumed 7 cups of atta and 60 cups of chini. Now, to find out how many more cups of atta she needs to consume to match her previous consumption pattern, we need to subtract the amount she has already consumed from the total amount she said she would consume (i.e., 6 - 7 = -1 cup). Therefore, Margi needs to consume 28 more cups of atta to match her previous consumption pattern."
Response:  The required number of cups of rice is 7 (11 - 4 = 7).
Response:  The person needs to drink another 4 cups of tea (6 - 3 = 4).
"Response: 26
Explanation:
From the information given in the question, we know that Mary has already filled 4 cups of atta and she needs to fill 18 more cups (i.e., 14 - 4 = 18). Since each cup of atta requires 3 cups of water, Mary will need 54 cups of water (i.e., 18 x 3 = 54) to make 18 additional cups of atta. Therefore, the total number of cups of atta that Mary can make is 4 + 18 = 26 cups."
"Response: 10 - 2 = 8
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Mary has already drunk 2 cups of tea before she started eating the cake. Now, she wants to drink 7 more cups of tea. So, the total number of cups of tea that Mary will drink is 7 + 2 = 9 cups. Since Namak (molasses) requires more water than tea, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of water to make up for the difference. Therefore, the final answer is 9 - 4 = 8 cups of tea that Mary will drink after eating the cake."
Response:  The number of cups of rice required to make 11 cups of chini is 7 cups. So, the person has already given 12 cups of atta and needs 5 more cups of rice to make 11 cups of chini.
Response:  To find out how many more cups of tea Rani needs to make 7 cups of tea as per her recipe, we need to subtract the number of cups she has already made (4 cups) from the total required number of cups (7 - 4 = 3). So, Rani needs to add 3 more cups of tea to make 7 cups in total.

Explanation:
The given passage mentions that there are 19 species of birds that migrate to warm countries during winter and return to their breeding grounds in summer. If 60% of these birds migrated to warmer areas during winter, then the number of bird families that migrated for winter can be calculated as follows:

Number of bird families = Total number of bird species x Percentage of birds that migrate for winter
= 19 x 0.60
= 11.4 (approximately)

Therefore, approximately 11.4 bird families migrated to warmer areas during winter."
"Response: 13506429
Explanation:
The given information is as follows:
* The number of bird families that migrate to warm countries during winter is 87.
* If 7 bird families migrated to cold regions in winter, then the number of bird families that remained behind in warm countries would be 87 - 7 = 80.
* To find out how many more birds remained behind in warm countries than those that migrated to cold regions, we need to subtract the number of birds that migrated from the total number of birds remaining behind: 80 - 7 = 73.
Therefore, there are 73 more birds that remained behind in warm countries than those that migrated to cold regions."

From the given information, we can conclude that there are 18 apples in Steve's basket and 12 apples in Jack's basket. Since Jack's basket is located 8 apple distance away from Steve's basket, the number of apples in Jack's basket = 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, the total number of apples (Steve + Jack) = 18 + 4 = 22 apples."
Response: 19 - 12 = 7. So Jack has 7 adjoining fields.
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Steve has 14 apples and Jack has 6 less than Steve, so Jack has 8 apples. Additionally, Jack's village has 3 more apples than Steve's village, so the total number of apples in Jack's village is 8 + 3 = 11 apples. Therefore, there are 11 apples in Jill's village."

"Response:  $63$
Explanation:
The total amount of money that Oliva had was $78$. She spent $15$ dollars on a supermarket bill, leaving her with $63$ dollars."
Response: 45 dollars.
Response:  $26 = (100 - 148) + (148 - 159)$
"Response:  $10 - (49/100) = $6.10$
Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
OLYMPIA's balance was $3 before she bought an Etymotic Research ER4XR earphone for $49. After buying the earphone, her balance became $49 - $49 = $0.
Since OLYMPIA paid $49 in cash, she had to pay $49 / 100 = $0.49 in taxes. Therefore, her new balance after paying taxes is $0 + ($0.49 / 100) = $0.49.
So, the amount of money that OLYMPIA gained by selling the earphone is $49 - $0.49 = $48.51."
"Response:  $27$
Explanation:
The total amount of money that Oliva invested in both Etienne and Supermarket is $53 + $91 = $144. After buying an item worth $14 from Supermarket, he had $144 - $14 = $130 left. So, Oliva invested $27 more in Supermarket than he did in Etienne."
Response: 30 dollars
"Response: 16600
Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the following table:

| Amount | Before Supermarket | After Supermarket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $54 | 54 | 29 |
| $29 | 29 | - |

To find out how much money Oliva saved after buying an item at a supermarket, we need to subtract the amount he spent ($29) from the amount he had before going to the supermarket ($54). Therefore, Oliva saved $25 ($54 - $29)."
Response:  $38 - ($128 \times \frac{3}{4}) = $15$  So, Oliva has made a profit of $15.

Explanation:
Neel had 242 cards in total and gave away 136 of them to Jeff. Therefore, Neel has 106 cards left with him."
"Response: 267
Explanation:
From the given information, we can deduce that Neel had 301 cards initially and gave away 154 of them to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards Neel had at the start is:
301 - 154 = 267
So, the answer is 267."
"Response: 306
Explanation: According to the question, Neel had 528 cards initially and gave some of them to Jeff. After this, Neel had 252 cards left in his possession. So, the number of cards that Neel gave to Jeff is 306 (528 - 252 = 306)."

From the given information, we can find out that Neel had 246 Basball cards and 214 10-card packs initially. After giving some of his cards to Jeff, he has 404 Baseball cards and 495 10-card packs left. Therefore, the number of Basball cards Neel gave to Jeff is 246 - 404 = 158. Since each 10-card pack contains 10 cards, the number of 10-card packs Neel gave to Jeff is 158 / 10 = 15. So, the number of Basball cards Neel gave to Jeff is 15 + 214 = 229."
"Response: 48
Explanation: According to the question, Neil had 573 cards initially and gave John 195 cards. After that, he gave Jeff some more cards, leaving him with 210 cards in total. Therefore, Neil gave John 48 cards (195 - 57 = 48)."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can see that Neil had 438 basball cards and 18 ten-card packs. He gave some of his cards away and now has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball card packs left. To find out how many more baseball cards he has than ten-card packs, we need to subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball card packs. So, the difference between the two is 26 (55 - 18 = 26). Therefore, Neil has 26 more baseball cards than ten-card packs."
"Response: 54
Explanation: According to the question, Neel had 239 base ball cards and 38 ten-card packs. He gave some of his cards away and now has 376 ten-card packs and 111 baseball card packs left. To find out how many more ten-card packs Neel has than baseball card packs, we need to subtract the number of baseball card packs from the total number of packs he has: 376 - 111 = 265. Since each ten-card pack contains 10 cards, Neel has 265 x 10 = 2650 more ten-card packs than baseball card packs."

Response: 1056720 bags of wheat. Explanation: According to the question, in one day, Santra cuts 38 trees and each tree has 42 branches. Therefore, in 49 days, he will have cut 38 x 42 = 1652 branches. Since each branch produces 4 bags of wheat, in 49 days, Santra will have produced 1652 x 4 = 6564 bags of wheat.
"Response: 1040
Explanation:
The given information can be represented in a table as follows:

| Day | Number of Boars Killed | Number of Santare in Each Boar | Total Number of Santare |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 66 | 25 | 1660 |
| 2 | 66 | 25 | 1660 |
|... |... |... |... |
| 87 | 66 | 25 | 1040 |

Therefore, after 87 days, there will be 1040 santare."
"Response: 240
Explanation:
The given information is as follows:

* The person cuts 8 branches every day.
* Each branch has 35 leaves.

So, the number of leaves cut every day = Number of branches cut / Number of leaves per branch = 8 x 35 = 280."
Response: 42 days.
"Response: 48
Explanation:
The given information is as follows:

* The person cuts 67 branches every day.
* Each branch has 12 santare (singular: santar).
* If he cuts 35 branches in total, then the number of santare cut = Total branches x Number of santare per branch
= 35 x 12
= 420
So, the person cuts 420 santare."
Response: 390 bags of wheat. Explanation: According to the question, Santram cuts 74 bundles of wheat every day and throws away 71 bundles. In total, he has thrown away 51 days' worth of bundles. Therefore, if he continues this practice for another 51 days, he will have thrown away 51 x 74 = 3690 bundles of wheat. However, since he has already thrown away 71 bundles per day, there are only 390 bags of wheat left.
"Response: 320
Explanation:
If each bore has 50 santars and they cut 76 bores per day, then the total number of santars cut per day is 76 x 50 = 3800. Since they also throw away 64 bores per day, the total number of santars thrown away per day is 64 x 50 = 3200. Therefore, the number of santars cut per day is 3800 - 3200 = 600."
"Response: 174
Explanation:
The given information can be represented in a table as follows:

| Day | Number of Boxes (Santare) | Total Number of Boxes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 28 | 28 |
| 2 | 28 | 56 |
| 3 | 28 | 84 |
|... |... |... |
| 26 | 0 | 174 |

As we know that Santare is equal to 28 boxes per day, and there are 26 days in total. So, the number of boxes after 26 days will be zero. Therefore, the final answer is 174 boxes."
"Response: 143
Explanation:

Explanation: According to the question, in 14 days, Narangi cut 56 branches of trees. Since each branch is equal to 1/56th of the total number of branches, we can calculate the total number of branches as follows: Total branches = Number of branches cut / Number of days taken = 56 / 14 = 320 Therefore, the answer is 320."
Response: 10864
"Response: 170
Explanation:
The given information is as follows:

* The number of santare (bore) that are cut every day = 65 + 46 = 111

Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 12 x 11 = 132 square feet.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 7 feet. If he wants to make it 14 feet tall, then the ceiling height of his room is 7 + (14 - 7) = 7 + 7 = 14 feet.
Response:  The length of Jessie's rooms is 7 feet. If he wants to make them 14 feet long, their width will be: 14 feet / 7 feet = 2 times wider. Therefore, the length of Jessie's rooms is 2 x 7 feet = 14 feet.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 11 feet and its length is 15 feet. If there was a wall that was previously 16 feet tall before Jessie moved in, then to accommodate Jessie's furniture, how many additional inches of space would be required for each wall?  Answer:  To determine the number of additional inches of space required for each wall, we need to subtract the previous height (16 feet) from the current height (11 feet) of each wall. For example, if one wall had a previous height of 16 feet and a current height of 11 feet, then an additional 5 inches of space (16 - 11 = 5) would be required for that wall. Similarly, if another wall had a previous height of 16 feet and a current height of 15 feet, then an additional 3 inches of space (16 - 15 = 3) would be required for that wall. Therefore, the total number of additional inches of space required for both walls would be 5 + 3 = 8 inches.
Response: 30 tiles are required to cover the entire floor of length 20 feet and width 12 feet.
Response: 356.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 19 feet and its width is 20 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 19 x 20 = 380 square feet.

Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 10 feet, and its width is 2 feet. Therefore, the area of her room is 10 x 2 = 20 square feet.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 18 feet and its width is 12 feet. If it has a ceiling height of 8 feet, then the volume of the room is: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 18 x 12 x 8 = 1440 cubic feet. Therefore, Jessie needs approximately 1440 cubic feet of space to move around comfortably in her room.

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Rajesh and Arjun together sold 242 T-shirts during their respective games of cricket and tennis. Since they sold 106 T-shirts each during their respective games, if they had sold 115 T-shirts during the game of cricket, then they would have sold 97 T-shirts (i.e., 115 - 106) during the game of tennis. Therefore, the number of T-shirts sold by Rajesh during the game of tennis is 97."
Response:  $163 - $89 = $74$  Arkansas played and Texas Tech played for a total of 163 T-shirts during their game. If they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $74 in profit from selling T-shirts during that game.
Response:  $ 104593.
Response:  The total amount of money earned by Raj and Ria through selling t-shirts and jeans is given by: Total revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt + Number of jeans sold x Price per jean In this case, they sold 183 t-shirts at $62 each and 31 jeans at $99 each. Therefore, their total revenue can be calculated as follows: Total revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99 = $10,574 + $2,899 = $13,473 So, Raj and Ria earned a total of $13,473 through selling t-shirts and jeans during the Arkansas and Texas games.

"Response:  $2385 
Explanation:
The total number of t-shirts sold by Reshma and Teku is 14. The cost price of each t-shirt is $20. So, the total revenue generated from selling these t-shirts is:
Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Cost price per t-shirt
= 14 x $20
= $280
Now, we need to find out how much profit they made by selling these t-shirts. Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $280 - ($20 x 14)
= $280 - $280
= $0
So, Reshma and Teku did not make any profit by selling these t-shirts."

Explanation:
The farmer earns $216 per week, which is equivalent to $9,384 per month ($216 x 4 weeks). If he invests $702 in a scheme that offers an interest rate of 8%, his total investment will be $7792 ($702 x 10 years). Therefore, at the end of 10 years, the farmer's total income will be $9,384 + $7792 = $17,176."
"Response:  $109648$
Explanation:
To calculate the total amount of money that Luis can make in one year (i.e., 365 days), we need to multiply the daily income by the number of days in a year. Since there are 223 weeks in a year, and each week has 7 days, the total number of days in a year is:

223 weeks x 7 days/week = 1571 days

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money that Luis can make in a year:

Total income per day = $1357
Total income per year = Total income per day x Number of days in a year
= $1357 x 1571 days
= $216,733

Since Luis works for 73 months (or years) out of the 365-day year, his total earnings over those 73 months will be:

Total earnings = Total income per year x Number of months worked
= $216,733 x 73 months
= $15,9648

Therefore, Luis can make approximately $15,9648 in one year if he works for 73 months."

Response:  The depth of water in the well after the pond's water level has risen by 10 feet is 9 + 10 = 19 feet.
Response:  The depth of water in the well is 20 feet. Therefore, if Ron is 8 feet tall and stands atop a mound that is 14 feet high, then the water level would be 6 feet (20 - 8) below Ron's feet.
Response:  The depth of water in the well after Ram and his friends had taken turns digging for 5 hours is given by the equation g(x) = 5x + 10, where x is the number of hours they have been digging. Since they dug for 5 hours, the depth of water in the well is g(5) = 5(5) + 10 = 37.5 feet. Therefore, the water is 37.5 feet deep.
Response: 20 feet. Explanation: According to the question, after taking a break of 15 minutes, they started digging again and reached a depth of 13 feet. Therefore, the water was 7 feet deeper than the previous depth (15 - 8 = 7).
Response:  The depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height, which means that if Ron is 9 feet tall, then the depth of water is 16 x 9 = 144 feet.
Response:  The depth of water in the pond is 9 feet. If Ron is 15 feet long and Den is 6 feet shorter than Ron, then the distance between Ron and the water surface is 9 - 6 = 3 feet.

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Melisa scored 109 points in each of the 10 games she played. Since every game has 82 bonus points, the total score for each game is 109 + 82 = 191 points per game.
Now, let's calculate the number of matches Melisa played:
Number of matches = Total number of games / Number of players in each match
= 109 games / 79 players (as there are 79 players in each match)
= 13.8 matches (round off to 14 matches)
So, Melisa played 14 matches and scored 191 points in each match, hence her total score was:
Total score = Number of matches x Score per match
= 14 x 191
= 5640 points"

From the given information, we can calculate the total number of boxes that can fit in each shelf as follows:
Shelves with 11 questions per box = Total number of boxes = Number of almirahs x Number of questions per box
= 4 almirahs x 11 boxes/almirah = 44 boxes
Now, let's find out how many questions are there in each shelf:

From the given information, we can calculate the total number of screws in 3941 skittles as follows:
Total number of screws = Number of skittles x Number of screws per skittle
= 3941 x 49
= 187,599
Since there are 4950 rubbers in total and each rubber has 49 screws, the number of screws in each rubber is:
Number of screws in each rubber = Total number of screws / Number of rubbers
= 187,599 / 4950
= 38
Now, if the rears are divided into 495 groups, then the number of screws in each group is:
Number of screws in each group = Total number of screws / Number of groups
= 187,599 / 495
= 387
Therefore, each group contains approximately 387 screws."
Response:  The number of skittles in each group can be calculated as follows: Total number of skittts = 896 Number of groups = 8 Since there are 517 red skittles and 90 orange skittles, we need to divide the total number of skittles by 8 to find out how many skittles are in each group: Number of skittles in each group = Total number of skittles / Number of groups = 896 / 8 = 112 skittles per group
