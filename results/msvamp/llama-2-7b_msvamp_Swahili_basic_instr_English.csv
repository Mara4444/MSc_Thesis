"Response: 25
Explanation: To calculate the total number of books that Tiffany had at first, we need to multiply the number of books she had after each purchase by the number of purchases made. So, if Tiffany had 10 books initially and bought 3 more, then she has 10 x 3 = 30 books now. If she then buys another 7 books, she will have 30 + 7 = 37 books in total. Therefore, the answer is 25 (37 - 10)."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 408 students who will be taking part in the exams and each student is expected to eat 5 portions of food per day. This means that the total number of portions of food that the students will consume per day is 408 x 5 = 2040 portions. If we assume that each portion of food contains approximately 500 calories (as suggested by the question), then the total number of calories consumed by the students per day would be 2040 x 500 = 102000 calories. However, since some students may not finish their entire meals, let's assume that only 90% of the students actually consume all the food they are given (i.e., 102000 / 1.9 = 53700 calories). Therefore, the answer to the question is 136 (the number of students who will consume more than 500 calories per day)."

Therefore, the difference in the number of push-ups performed by David and Zachary is 28 (i.e., 18 more than David)."
Response: 58
"Response: 10 more push-ups than crunches. 
Explanation: According to the question, Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. If he did 10 more push-ups than crunches, then he did 68 push-ups (58 + 10)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Zachary performed 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. To determine which exercise he did more of, we need to compare the number of push-ups with the number of crunches. Since 5 is less than 17, Zachary did more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, the answer is 30 (the difference between the two numbers)."

"Response: 100 - (2 x 6) = 40
Explanation: To calculate the amount of money that Gwen has left after buying 8 items and spending Shs 6000, we need to subtract the cost of the items from the total amount of money that Gwen had. In this case, Gwen had Shs 10,000 and spent Shs 6000, so she is left with Shs 4000."
"Response: 100 - (4 x 3) = 100 - 12 = 88
Therefore, if Gwen had 100 shillings and gave away 4 shillings to her mother, she would have 88 shillings left."
"Response: 100 - (8 + 5) = 37
Explanation: To find out how much money Gwen's mother has left after buying 8 kilograms of sugar and 5 kilograms of flour, we need to subtract the amount spent on those items from the initial amount of money that Gwen's mother had. So, if Gwen's mother initially had 100 shillings and spent 8 shillings on sugar and 5 shillings on flour, then she would have 100 - 8 - 5 = 37 shillings left."
"Response: 100 - (6 x 2) = 80
Explanation: To find out how much money Gwen's father gave her after she spent Sh50 from what her mother had given her, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount her mother gave her. Since her mother gave her Sh300 and she spent Sh50, her mother gave her Sh250 left. Then, if her father gave her an additional Sh100, that means he gave her Sh100 more than what her mother gave her, so the answer is Sh80."
"Response: 100 - (2 x 7) = 30
Therefore, if Gwen had taken Sh5 from her mother and gave Sh7 to her father, then she would have been left with Sh30."
Response:  The total amount of money that Gwen's father gave her is 100 shillings more than the amount that her mother gave her. If Gwen received 50 shillings from her father and her mother gave her 20 shillings less than what her father gave her, then the amount of money that Gwen's mother gave her is 40 shillings. Therefore, if Gwen's father gave her 60 shillings more than what her mother gave her, then the total amount of money that he gave her is 60 + 40 = 100 shillings more than what her mother gave her.

Response:  The number of days that Marco took to harvest 100 bags of maize is 32 days. Therefore, if Baba Yao's farm had 8 times as many trees as Marco's farm, it would take him 32 x 8 = 256 days to harvest 100 bags of maize.
Response: 10
Response:  The number of stoveries that Marco had before he planted the wheat was 36. When he harvested the wheat, he got 8 bundles of wheat. After harvesting, the number of stoveries left with Marco was 12. Therefore, the remaining number of stoveries after harvesting is 12 - 36 = -24.
Response:  The number of stoveries that Marco had at the beginning was 22. After he harvested them, he got additional 30 stoveries, making his total number of stoveries to be 52. Therefore, the number of stoveries that Marco had after harvesting is 52.

Since Baba Yao's basket contains 25 bananas, the total weight of all the bananas in Baba Yao's basket is 25 x 170 = 4250 grams, which is less than the total weight of bananas in Marco's basket."

Explanation: To calculate the number of points scored by Fulana in the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, we need to subtract the number of points scored by Fulana against each team from the total number of points scored by both teams.
Fulana scored 183 points against Arkansas and 31 points against Texas Tech, so the total number of points scored by Fulana is:
183 + 31 = 214
The number of points scored by Fulana against Arkansas is:
183 - 31 = 152
Therefore, Fulana scored 152 points against Arkansas and 31 points against Texas Tech, for a total of 107 points."

"Response: 31
Explanation: To determine which is more expensive between soda and coffee, we need to calculate their prices in terms of shillings per unit. For soda, the price is Shs 19 per liter, while for coffee it's Shs 60 per kilogram. Since one liter is equal to 1000 grams, we can convert the price of coffee to Shs per gram by dividing it by 1000 (Shs 60 / 1000 = Shs 0.06). Therefore, the cost of one cup of coffee (assuming an average weight of 250 grams) would be Shs 0.06 x 250 = Shs 15. So, based on this calculation, coffee is more expensive than soda."

Response:  The number of days it would take to fill a pipeline with water is directly proportional to the diameter of the pipe and inversely proportional to the flow rate of water through the pipe. Let's assume that the diameter of the pipe is 1 meter (m) and the flow rate of water through the pipe is 8 cubic meters per second (m^3/s). To calculate the time taken to fill the pipeline, we can use the formula: Time = Diameter / Flow Rate x Number of Seconds in a Day (which is equal to 86,400 seconds). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Time = 1 m / 8 m^3/s x 86,400 s = 10,795.5 s or approximately 10 hours and 49 minutes. Therefore, it would take approximately 10 hours and 49 minutes to fill a pipeline with water using this example scenario.

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Helen's weight increased by 31 kg during the day (from 270 kg to 419 kg), and then decreased by 568 kg from evening till morning of the next day. Therefore, the total change in Helen's weight from evening till morning of the next day is 568 kg."
"Response: 236
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Helen has 90 friends and 51 neighbors who visit her daily for 484 hours (or 19 days). Therefore, the total number of visitors Helen receives per day is 90 + 51 = 141. Dividing this number by 24 gives us the average number of visitors per hour, which is 141 / 24 = 5.75. Since we cannot have a fraction of a visitor, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6. So, Helen receives an average of 6 visitors per hour."
"Response: 1039
Explanation: To find out how many biscuits Helen has eaten in total, we need to add up all the numbers of biscuits she has eaten per day. According to the question, Helen eats 527 biscuits per week and 86 biscuits per day during the night. Therefore, her total number of biscuit consumption is: 527 x 7 = 3691 + 86 x 24 = 2048 = 1039."
"Response: 263
Explanation: To find out how many biscuits Helen has eaten, we need to subtract the number of biscuits she has given away from the total number of biscuits she had. Helen gave away 144 biscuits and ate 397 - 144 = 253 biscuits. Therefore, Helen has eaten 263 biscuits (253 + 10)."

"Response: 476
Explanation: To determine how many biscuits Helen has taken from each category, we need to subtract the number of biscuits she gave away (300) from her total number of biscuits (519). This gives us 219 biscuits left for Helen. Then, we subtract the number of biscuits she took from the ""zabibu"" category (280) from the remaining biscuits (219), which gives us 39 biscuits left for Helen. Therefore, Helen has taken 476 biscuits in total."

Explanation: To find out how much money was spent by all players in one week, we need to multiply the number of days in that week (7) by the amount spent per day ($420). This gives us $2940. Since some players spent more than others, we subtract the amount each player spent from this total. For example, if Player A spent $22, we subtract that amount from the total, leaving $2918. Therefore, the remaining amount is $156."
