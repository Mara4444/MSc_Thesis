Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. Next, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  18 - 10 = 8 So, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday. Next, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Monday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday:  12 - 11 =?  Yes, that's right! She played with 1 more child on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  First, Julia played with 5 children on Monday. So, on Monday, she played with  5 children. On Tuesday, she played with more children, but we don't know how many yet. We do know that in total, she played with 15 children. So, if we add the number of children she played with on Monday to the number of children she played with on Tuesday, we can find out how many children she played with on Tuesday. Let's do this:  5 + x = 15 (where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday)  Now solve for x:  5 + x = 15  X = 10  Therefore, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday. So, if she played with all 16 children in total, then Monday's group would have been smaller than Tuesday's group. We can let x represent the number of children Julia played with on Monday. Since we know that Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday, we can set up the equation: x + 14 = 16. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 children on Monday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played with 16 children on Monday. Secondly, we are given that there were 12 more children playing on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, if we subtract 16 (Monday) from 12 (Tuesday), we get: 16 - 12 = 4 So, Julia played with 4 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday. In total, Julia played with 16 + 4 = 20 children on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and 8 more children than she did on Monday. So, if she played with x children on Monday, then she played with x + 8 children on Tuesday. Now, let's find out how many children Julia played with on each day. We can do this by setting up two equations based on the information given in the problem. Equation for Monday:  x + 8 = 14... (1) Equation for Tuesday:  x + 8 = 22... (2) Solving equation (1) first, we get:  x = 6 Since we already have the value of x, substitute it into equation (2):  6 + 8 = 22 14 = 22 Yes! The correct answer is 14 children on Monday and 22 children on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 17 children on Monday. Next, she played with 15 children on Tuesday. Finally, she played with 2 children on Wednesday. To find out how many children in total, let's add up all these numbers:  17 + 15 + 2 = 34 So, Julia played with 34 children in total.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with 15 + 18 = 33 children over two days. Next, we are told that on Wednesday, she played with 97 children. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with is 33 + 97 = 130.
"Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 15 children on Wednesday. So, the total number of children she played with during the week is 5 + 15 = 20. Next, we need to find out how many children she played with each day. We can start by finding out how many children she played with on Monday. Since there were 5 children, we can say that Julia played with 5 children on Monday. Now, let's move on to Tuesday. We know that there were 9 children in addition to the 5 children from Monday, so the total number of children Julia played with on Tuesday is 5 + 9 = 14. Finally, we can calculate the number of children Julia played with on Wednesday by adding the 15 children from Wednesday to the 14 children from Tuesday, which gives us 14 + 15 = 29. Therefore, the numeric answer to the question ""How many children did Julia play with on Monday and Tuesday?"" is 5 + 14 = 19."
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 2 children on Monday. Next, she played with 14 children on Tuesday and 16 children on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 children.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 9 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  9 - 7 = 2  Next, we know that Julia played with 96 children on Wednesday. So, we can ask how many more children she played with on Wednesday compared to Tuesday:  96 - 7 = 89  Therefore, Julia played with 89 more children on Wednesday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday. Next, she played with 2 children on Tuesday and 8 children on Wednesday. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday.  14 - 8 =?  Yes, that's right! Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 8 children on Monday and 11 children on Tuesday. Next, we know that she played with 9 children on Wednesday. So, to find out how many more children Julia played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract 9 from 11.  11 - 9 = 2 Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, we can start by comparing these two numbers:  15 vs. 18. We see that 18 is greater than 15, so there were more children playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday. Now, let's look at Wednesday. We are told that Julia played with 7 children on Wednesday. Comparing this number to the previous two days, we see that 7 is less than both 15 and 18. Therefore, there were fewer children playing with Julia on Wednesday than on either Monday or Tuesday. To summarize our findings, we can say that there were more children playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday, and fewer children playing with her on Wednesday than on either of the first two days.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 13 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 13 + 10 = 23 children in two days. On Wednesday, she played cards with 15 children, so she played with a total of 23 + 15 = 38 children in three days. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 38 children.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 7 + 13 = 20 children. Next, we know that she played cards with 20 children on Wednesday, so in total, Julia played with 20 + 20 = 40 children.   Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday, so she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children.   Next, we know that each game of hide-and-seek lasted for 3 hours, so if we multiply 26 children by 3 hours per game, we get:  26 x 3 = 78 hours   Finally, since there were two days (Monday and Tuesday), we need to double the total number of hours to find out how many hours Julia spent playing in total:  78 x 2 = 156 hours   Therefore, Julia spent a total of 156 hours playing hide-and-seek with all the children.
"Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  

19 - 18 = 1 

So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday. Now, let's calculate how many hours Julia spent playing with each group of children. We know that she spent 38 hours in total playing both days. So, if we divide the total time by the number of children she played with each day, we can find out how much time she spent with each group:  

38 / 19 = 2 (Monday)  
38 / 18 = 2.17 (Tuesday)  Since we cannot have a fraction of a child, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Julia spent 2 hours playing with the 19 children on Monday and 2 hours playing with the 18 children on Tuesday."
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 5 children on Tuesday and 6 children on Monday. Next, we need to find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  6 (Monday) - 5 (Tuesday) =?  Now we have our answer! On Monday, Julia played with 1 more child than on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday. So, if she played with x children on Tuesday, then she played with 4 + x children in total. Now, we are given that she played with a total of 18 children. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:  4 + x = 18  Solving for x, we get:  x = 14  So, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 4 children on Wednesday. Next, we know that she played with 6 children on Monday and 17 children on Tuesday. So, to find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday.  4 - 6 = -2  Therefore, Julia played with 2 fewer children on Wednesday than on Monday.
Response:  Bobby had eaten some candies before he ate 25 more candies. So, if we let x be the number of candies that Bobby had eaten before, then he had eaten a total of x + 25 candies altogether. We know that x + 25 = 43, so we can solve for x as follows: x + 25 = 43 x = 18 Therefore, Bobby had eaten 18 candies before he ate 25 more candies.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 28 candies. Then, he ate 42 more candies. So, in total, Bobby ate  28 + 42 = 70 candies.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 33 candies. Then, he ate 4 more candies. So, in total, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 candies. Next, Bobby ate 14 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of candies and chocolates that Bobby ate is 37 + 14 = 51.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 38 candies. Then, he ate an additional 36 candies. In total, Bobby ate  38 + 36 = 74 candies. Now, let's compare the number of candies Bobby ate with the number of chocolates he ate. Bobby ate 16 chocolates. So, we can say that Bobby ate more candies than chocolates. Specifically, he ate  74 - 16 = 58 more candies than chocolates.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 34 candies. Then he ate an additional 18 candies. So in total, Bobby ate 34 + 18 = 52 candies.
Response:  Bobby had 21 candies to start with and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 candies left. Then, he ate another 9 candies, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 candies left. Therefore, Bobby has 7 candies left.
Response:  Bobby had 22 candies and he ate some of them. Then he ate 5 more. So, if he has 8 candies left, how many did he eat in total?  1. He ate some of the initial 22 candies. Let x be the number of candies he ate. 2. He ate 5 more candies after that. So, the total number of candies he ate is x + 5. Now we can set up an equation based on the information given: 22 - x = 8 We can solve for x by subtracting 8 from both sides: 22 - x = 8 22 - x = 8 - 8 22 - x = 0 x = 14 Therefore, Bobby ate 14 candies in total.
Response:  Bobby had 19 candies and he ate 2 of them. So, how many candies does Bobby have left?  19 - 2 = 17.  Therefore, Bobby has 17 candies left.
"Response:  First, Bobby had 32 candies and he ate some of them. Second, he left 20 candies. So, if we subtract the number of candies he ate from the total number of candies he had, we can find out how many candies he ate.  32 - x = 20  Where ""x"" is the number of candies Bobby ate. Now solve for ""x"".  We know that 32 - x = 20, so we can add 32 to both sides of the equation:  32 + 32 = 20 + 32  64 = 52   Bobby ate 12 candies."
Response:  First, Bobby ate 17 candies, so he has 36 - 17 = 19 left. Then, he ate another 15 candies, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 left. Therefore, Bobby has 4 candies left.
Response:  Bobby started with 30 candies and ate 23 of them. So, he has 30 - 23 = 7 candies left.

Response:  We know that Alan has 2 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. To find out how many more balloons Jake has than Alan, we can subtract the number of balloons Alan has from the number of balloons Jake has:  3 (Jake) - 2 (Alan) =?  So, Jake has 1 more balloon than Alan.
Response:  If Alan has 2 balloons and Jake has x balloons, then together they have 2 + x balloons. We know that in total they have 3 balloons, so we can set up an equation:  2 + x = 3  Solving for x gives us:  x = 1  So Jake has 1 balloon.
Response:  Jake has 6 balloons and Alan has x balloons.  Since Jake has 4 more balloons than Alan, we can write an equation:  6 = x + 4  Now solve for x:  x = 2  So Alan brought 2 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan brought 5 balloons to the park. Secondly, we are told that Jake had more balloons than Alan. Therefore, Jake must have brought at least 5 + 1 = 6 balloons to the park. So, Jake brought 6 balloons to the park.
Response:  First, Alann holds 3 balloons and Jake has 5 balloons, so together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons. Then, Alan buys 2 more balloons in the park, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons. In total, there are 5 + 5 = 10 balloons in the park.
"Response:  First, we know that Alan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. Next, we are told that Alan bought 3 more balloons at the park, so he now has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. Therefore, Alan had more balloons than Jake, who only had 4.  

So, the correct answer is 5 for Alan and 4 for Jake."
Response:  First, we know that Alan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Next, we know that Alan bought 3 more balloons at the park, so he has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Now, let's add up all the balloons that Jake and Alan have:  Jake has 6 balloons, and Alan has 5 balloons, for a total of 6 + 5 = 11 balloons. Therefore, Jake had more balloons than Alan in the park.
Response:  First, Al...
Response:  First, we know that Alan has 6 balloons and Jake has 2 balloons to start with.   Next, we know that Jake buys 3 more balloons in the park, so Jake now has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons.  Now, let's find out how many balloons Alan has after Jake bought his additional balloons.  We can do this by subtracting the number of balloons Jake bought from Alan's original amount of balloons:  6 - 3 = 3.  Therefore, Alan has 3 balloons left after Jake bought his additional balloons.
Response:  First, Alan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons. Then, Jake bought 4 more balloons in the park, so he now has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons. Therefore, Jake has 7 balloons and Alan still has 6 balloons.
Response:  First, Alana had 5 balloons and Jake had 6 balloons. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park, so he has 6 + 3 = 9 balloons now. Therefore, Jake brought 9 balloons to the park.
Response:  First, we know that Alan has 3 wind balloons and 20 balls. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  3 + 20 = 23  Now let's look at Jake's situation. He has 5 wind balloons and 59 balls. If we add up all these numbers, we get:  5 + 59 = 64  Therefore, together, Alan and Jake have 23 + 64 = 87 wind balloons.
Response:  First, we know that Alan has 7 wind balloons and 5 balls. So, he has a total of 7 + 5 = 12 objects.  Next, we know that Jake has 6 wind balloons and 4 balls. So, he has a total of 6 + 4 = 10 objects.  Therefore, together they have 12 + 10 = 22 objects in total.
Response:  If Alan has 5 balloons and Jake has x balloons, then together they have 5 + x balloons. The problem states that they brought a total of 6 balloons to the park. So we can set up an equation:  5 + x = 6  Solving for x, we get:  x = 1  Therefore, Jake had 1 balloon.
Response:  Firstly, Alan bought two balloons at the park and then he bought three more balloons there. So in total, Alan has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Now, if Jake brought six balloons to the park, Jake would have 6 balloons. Therefore, Jake has more balloons than Alan at the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how much more time he spends on English compared to Chinese, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on Chinese from the amount of time he spends on English.  6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours So, Ryan spends 4 hours more on English than on Chinese each day.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. Next, we need to find out how much more time he spends studying Chinese compared to English. To do this, we can subtract the amount of time he spends studying English from the amount of time he spends studying Chinese:  7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour So, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than he does studying English.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours daily studying English and an additional amount of time (x) studying Chinese every day. Therefore, he spends a total of 3 + x hours per day learning languages. Since he spends 4 hours daily on language studies in total, we can set up the following equation:  3 + x = 4  Simplifying the equation:  3 + x = 4  2 + x = 4 - 3   x = 1  So, Ryan spends 1 hour studying Chinese every day.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and more than 7 hours studying Chinese. So he spends at least 9 hours (7 + 2) studying Chinese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spends 5 hours daily studying Chinese and English. Secondly, he spends more time studying English than Chinese. Therefore, we can let X represent the number of hours Ryan studies English. Since he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, we have: X = Chinese study time + 2 Now, we know that Chinese study time is 5 hours per day, so: X = 5 + 2 X = 7 Thus, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. So, in total, he studies for 13 hours per day (6 + 7). Now, let's consider how many hours he will study over 5 days.  5 days x 13 hours/day = 65 hours (5 x 13) Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 65 hours studying both languages over 5 days.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, then he studies for a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day. Since there are two days in total, Ryan will study for a total of 11 x 2 = 22 hours over the two-day period.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English, so he studies English for 5 x 7 = 35 hours during the week. Next, we know that he spends 4 hours per day studying Chinese, so he studies Chinese for 4 x 7 = 28 hours during the week. Therefore, in total, Ryan spends 35 + 28 = 63 hours studying languages during the week.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. Therefore, if he studies for 86 days, he will study English for 4 x 86 = 344 hours and Chinese for 6 x 86 = 516 hours. So, in one day, Ryan spends 344/86 + 516/86 = 4.2 + 6.0 = 10.2 hours studying English and Chinese respectively.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. So, he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day learning these two languages. Next, we are told that he spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish. Therefore, the total amount of time Ryan spends learning all three languages is 13 + 3 = 16 hours per day.
Response:  First, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. So, he spends 6 x 7 = 42 hours per week learning English and 3 x 7 = 21 hours per week learning Chinese. Next, we are asked how much more time Ryan spends on English compared to Chinese. To find this out, we need to subtract the amount of time spent on Chinese from the amount of time spent on English. In other words, we can say: Time spent on English - Time spent on Chinese = Amount of extra time spent on English. Using the numbers above, we get: 42 hours - 21 hours = 21 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 21 hours more on English than on Chinese each week.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how much more time he spends on English compared to Spanish, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on Spanish from the amount of time he spends on English.  7 hours - 4 hours = 3 hours So, Ryan spends 3 hours more on English than on Spanish each day.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day, and he spends 4 hours studying Spanish. To find out how much more time he spends studying Chinese than Spanish, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends studying Spanish from the amount of time he spends studying Chinese.  5 hours - 4 hours = 1 hour So, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than Spanish each day.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day studying English and x hours per day studying Chinese. Since he studies for a total of 3 hours per day, we can set up the equation:  2 + x = 3  Simplifying the equation:  2 + x = 3  Solving for x:  x = 1 hour  Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day studying Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, so he spends a total of:  4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours learning English 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours learning Chinese Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 28 + 35 = 63 hours studying both languages over the course of 1 week.
Response:  Firstly, Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans on Monday. Secondly, she found 7 more bags of cans the next day. So in total, Tiffany collected 8 + 7 = 15 bags of cans. Therefore, the number of bags of cans that Tiffany collected on Monday was 15 - 7 = 8 bags more than the number of bags she collected the next day.
Response:  First, we know that Tiffany collected 7 bags of cans on Monday. Next, she found 12 more bags of cans the following day. To find out how many bags of cans Tiffany found on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of bags she collected on Monday from the total number of bags she found. So, we can set up an equation like this:  12 - 7 =?  This gives us:  12 - 7 = 5  Therefore, Tiffany found 5 more bags of cans on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 bags of cans.  On Tuesday, she found more bags of cans. So, let's say she found x additional bags of cans.  In total, Tiffany had 4 + x bags of cans on Tuesday.  Now, we know that the total number of bags of cans Tiffany had on Tuesday is equal to the number of bags she had on Monday plus the number of additional bags she found.  So, we can set up the equation:  4 + x = 6  Solving for x, we get:  x = 2  Therefore, Tiffany found 2 additional bags of cans on Tuesday.
Response:  First, Tiffany collected some cans on Monday and had bags of them. Then, she found more cans the next day, so let's call the number of bags she had on Monday x. On Tuesday, she found 4 more bags of cans, so she had a total of x + 4 bags on Tuesday. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: x + (x + 4) = 8. Combine like terms: 2x + 4 = 8. Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 2. So, Tiffany had 2 bags of cans on Monday.
Response:  First day, Tiffany collected 10 bags of cans.   Next day, she found 3 more bags of cans.  The following day, she found 7 more bags of cans.  So in total, Tiffany collected 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bags of cans.
Response:  First, Tiffany found 8 bags of cans on Monday.   Next day, she found 10 bags of cans, which is more than 8. So, we can say that the number of bags of cans increased by 2 from Monday to Tuesday.  The next day, she found 4 bags of cans less than the previous day. Therefore, we can deduce that the number of bags of cans decreased by 4 from Tuesday to Wednesday.  Now, let's summarize the information:  On Monday, Tiffany found 8 bags of cans.  On Tuesday, she found 10 bags of cans (an increase of 2).  On Wednesday, she found 4 fewer bags of cans (a decrease of 4) compared to Tuesday.  Based on this information, we can conclude that Tiffany found a total of 8 + 10 - 4 = 14 bags of cans over three days.
"Response:  First, Tiffany had 3 bags of cans on Monday. Then, she found 7 more bags of cans the next day, for a total of 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans. Additionally, she had 44 bottles of soda. So, in total, Tiffany had 10 bags of cans and 44 bottles of soda.  

Answer: 44 (bottles) + 10 (bags of cans)"
Response:  First, we know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in total. Next, we need to find out how many more red apples there are than green apples. To do this, we can subtract the number of green apples from the number of red apples:  17 - 16 =?  The difference between the two numbers is... 3! So, there are 3 more red apples than green apples.
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in total. Next, we need to find out how many more green apples there are than red apples. To do this, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples:  11 (green) - 5 (red) = 6  So, there are 6 more green apples than red apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and more than 10 green apples in the basket. So we can start by writing an equation based on this information:  10 + x = 15 (where x is the number of green apples) Now let's solve for x. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x. In other words, we need to get rid of all the numbers except for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:  10 + x = 15 Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:  x = 5 Therefore, there are 5 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are three red apples and more than ten green apples in the basket.  So if we subtract three from ten, we get seven.  Therefore, there are seven green apples in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that there are red apples (7), yellow apples (15), and green apples (8) in total. So, let's add them up: 7 + 15 + 8 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 apples in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 red apples and 71 yellow apples in total. Next, we know that there are 8 green apples. Now, let's compare the number of green apples to the number of yellow apples. We can see that there are 8 green apples, but there are 71 yellow apples. So, if we subtract the number of green apples from the number of yellow apples, we get:  71 - 8 = 63  Therefore, there are 63 more yellow apples than green apples.
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 yellow oranges and 14 green oranges in total. Next, we need to find out how many more green oranges there are than yellow oranges. To do this, we can subtract the number of yellow oranges from the total number of green oranges.  6 (yellow) + 14 (green) = 20 Total number of green oranges: 20 - 6 (yellow) = 14 So, there are 14 more green oranges than yellow oranges.
Response:  First, we know that there are 19 red apples and 11 yellow apples. Next, we can compare these numbers to find out how many more red apples there are than yellow apples. To do this, we subtract the number of yellow apples from the number of red apples:  19 - 11 = 8 So, there are 8 more red apples than yellow apples in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 red apples and 16 green apples in total.  So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  6 + 16 = 22 Now, let's look at the number of yellow apples. There are 90 yellow apples in total. If we add all three numbers together, we get:  22 + 90 = 112 Therefore, there are 112 apples in total - 6 red, 16 green, and 90 yellow.
Response:  First, we know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples. Next, we can add these numbers together to get the total number of apples in the basket:  18 + 14 = 32  So, there are 32 apples in the basket in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 red apples and 14 yellow apples in total. Next, we know that there are 6 green apples. So, if we add up all of these numbers together, we get:  5 + 14 + 6 = 25  Therefore, there are 25 fruits in total in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 65 baskets in total and each basket contains both red and green apples.  Since there are 7 red apples in each basket, we can calculate the number of red apples as follows:  
Number of red apples = Total number of baskets x Number of red apples per basket 
= 65 x 7 
= 455 
So, there are 455 red apples in total. Similarly, since there are 3 green apples in each basket, we can calculate the number of green apples as follows: 
Number of green apples = Total number of baskets x Number of green apples per basket 
= 65 x 3 
= 195 
Therefore, there are 195 green apples in total. In summary, there are 455 red apples and 195 green apples in total."
"Response:  First, we know that each basket has a total of 28 fruits (10 red and 18 green).  So, if we multiply the number of baskets by the total number of fruits in each basket, we get:  
11 x 28 =?  Can you solve for the answer?"
"Response:  We know that there are 6 baskets in total, and each basket contains both red and green apples.  Since there are 16 red apples in each basket, we can calculate the total number of red apples as follows:  
Total number of red apples = Number of baskets x Number of red apples per basket  
= 6 x 16  
= 96  
Therefore, there are 96 red apples in total."
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 baskets in total.  Second, each basket contains 10 red apples and 2 green apples.  Therefore, to find out how many green apples there are in total, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of green apples per basket:  7 x 2 = 14  So, there are 14 green apples in total.
Response:  We know that each basket has a total of 7 peaches (red and green).   Red peaches are in baskets in groups of 4, so there must be 7/4 = 1 and 7/4 = 2 baskets with red peaches.   Green peaches are also in baskets in groups of 3, so there must be 7/3 = 2 baskets with green peaches. Therefore, there are 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 baskets in total.
Response:  We know that each basket has 4 red apples and some green apples. Since there are 2 baskets in total, we can say that the number of red apples is 4 x 2 = 8. Now, let's find out how many green apples there are. We know that there are fewer green apples than red apples because there are only so many green apples in total (not enough to fill both baskets). So if we subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples, we get the number of green apples: Total apples - Red apples = Green apples. In this case, the total number of apples is 12 (given), and the number of red apples is 8, so: 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 green apples in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 16 in total and 13 red ones. That means we have 16 - 13 = 3 green ones. So, there are 3 green apples in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that each basket has a total of 23 fruit (19 red + 4 green).  Now, let's multiply the number of baskets by the total number of fruits in each basket:  15 x 23 =?  Can you solve for the answer?
Response:  We know that there are 10 fruits in total and each basket has 4 red ones and 6 green ones. So we can start by finding out how many baskets we need to make with 10 fruits in total.   To find this out, we divide 10 by 4 (the number of red fruits per basket): 10 / 4 = 2 With 2 remaining. Since we cannot have a fraction of a basket, we round up to the nearest whole number: 2 + 1 = 3 So, we need 3 baskets to put all the fruits in.
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 red apples and 6 yellow apples in total.  Next, we know that there are 60 yellow apples. Therefore, the number of yellow apples is 60 - 6 = 54 more than the number of red apples. Finally, since there are only 2 red apples, the difference between the number of yellow apples and the number of red apples is 54 + 2 = 56. So, there are 56 more yellow apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  First, Jerry had 4 action figures on the shelf. Then he added more. So, if he added x more action figures, then in total, there would be 4 + x action figures on the shelf. Now, we know that there are 8 action figures on the shelf in total. So, we can set up an equation:  4 + x = 8  To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:   x = 8 - 4  x = 4  Therefore, Jerry added 4 action figures to the shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had some action figures on the shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 10 action figures on his shelf now. To find out how many action figures Jerry had initially, we can subtract the number of action figures he added from the total number of action figures he has now.  10 - 7 = 3 Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures initially.
Response:  First, Jerry had 4 action figures on the shelf. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So in total, there are 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 5 + 7 = 12 action figures on his shelf. However, we are asked how many action figures there are compared to the number of books. Since there are 9 books, we can say that there are 12 - 9 = 3 more action figures than books. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. Now, let's count how many books Jerry had. He had 10 books initially, and later, he did not add or remove any books. Therefore, the number of books Jerry had was still 10. To summarize, Jerry had 6 action figures and 10 books on his shelf after adding the additional 4 action figures.
Response:  First, Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on the shelf. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So in total, how many books were there?  8 + 9 = 17 books were on the shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry had 7 + 4 = 11 items on his shelf. However, there were more action figures than books on the shelf. Therefore, we can say that there were 7 (action figures) > 4 (books). In other words, there were 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 5 + 2 = 7 action figures and 2 + 9 = 11 books on his shelf. Therefore, there are 11 - 7 = 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 8 action figures on the shelf. Then he added 4 more, so now there are:  8 + 4 = 12 action figures on the shelf. Next, he removed 5 old ones, leaving:  12 - 5 = 7 action figures on the shelf. So, there were 7 action figures left on the shelf after Jerry was done.
Response:  First, Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf. Then he added 4 more, so now there are 3 + 4 = 7 action figures in total. Next, we know that Jerry removed some of the old ones to make room for the new ones. So if he removed x old action figures and kept y new ones, then we can set up an equation based on this information:  3 (old) + 4 (new) = 7 (total)  3x + 4y = 7 Now we need to find out how many old action figures Jerry removed. To do this, we can subtract the number of new action figures from both sides of the equation:  3x + 4y - 4y = 7 - 4y  3x = 3 Since we know that Jerry removed some of the old ones, we can say that 3x represents the number of old action figures he removed. Therefore, the correct answer is: Jerry removed 3 action figures from his shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf. Then he added more than 3 action figures to the shelf (since there are now 8 in total). So, Jerry added 3 + 7 = 10 action figures to the shelf. However, he removed 10 old ones from the shelf, leaving only 8 new ones. Therefore, Jerry added 10 - 3 = 7 action figures to the shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had some action figures on the shelf. Then he added two more and removed seven old ones. So, if we start with the number of action figures Jerry had initially, we can find out how many he has now.  Initially, Jerry had x action figures. He added 2, so now he has x + 2. He removed 7, so now he has x + 2 - 7. Simplifying, we get: x + 2 - 7 = 10  Solving for x, we get: x = 4  Therefore, Jerry had 4 action figures initially.
Response:  First, Jerry had 9 action figures on the shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on the shelf. However, we know that there were also 10 books on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures on the shelf is greater than the number of books. In other words, there are more action figures than books.  So, the answer is 16 (the total number of action figures).
Response:  First, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on the shelf. Then he added 2 more action figures. So, in total, there are:  3 (books) + 4 (action figures initially) + 2 (additional action figures) = 9 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf before he added two more action figures. So, the total number of items on his shelf was:  7 (books) + 3 (action figures) = 10 Now, let's add the two additional action figures that Jerry added later. The new total is:  10 (items already there) + 2 (additional action figures) = 12 Therefore, the total number of items on Jerry's shelf after he added the two action figures is 12.
Response:  First, there were two birds sitting on the fence. Then, some more birds joined them. So, in total, we have 2 + x birds sitting on the fence, where x is the number of additional birds that joined. We know that the current total number of birds on the fence is 6. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  2 + x = 6  Simplifying the equation, we get:  2 + x = 6  3 = 6  3 = x  So, three more birds joined the original two birds on the fence.
Response:  First, there were some birds sitting on the fence. Then, four more birds joined them. So, in total, how many birds are currently on the fence? We can use addition to find out.  5 (new birds) + x (birds already on the fence) = 5 (total number of birds on the fence)  Now we need to solve for x.  If five new birds joined the existing ones, then the total number of birds on the fence is five. Therefore, x must be equal to four because four birds were already on the fence before the other five birds arrived.  So, the correct answer is four birds were already on the fence when the other five birds arrived.
Response:  First, we know that there were 4 birds and 46 crows sitting on the fence initially. So, the total number of birds was 4 + 46 = 50. Now, if 6 more birds joined, the total number of birds would be 50 + 6 = 56. Therefore, there are 56 birds sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  First, there were 3 birds and 2 crows sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds joined them. So, in total, how many birds and crows are sitting on the fence?  3 + 5 = 8 birds sat on the fence. And we already had 2 crows, so there are 2 + 8 = 10 animals sitting on the fence altogether.
Response:  Firstly, there were 3 birds and 4 crows sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have: 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. However, among these birds, there are only 3 crows (the original 4 crows plus one additional crow). Therefore, the number of birds sitting on the fence minus the number of crows is: 5 - 3 = 2. So, there are 2 birds sitting on the fence that are not crows.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 birds and 6 crows sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds joined, so in total, we have 2 + 3 = 5 birds. Now, let's count how many crows are still sitting on the fence. We know that there were 6 crows initially, and no crows left or joined. So, the number of crows remaining on the fence is still 6. Therefore, there are 6 crows and 5 birds (including the new ones) sitting on the fence altogether.
Response:  First, we know that there are 4 crows and 6 storks sitting on the fence. So, the total number of birds on the fence is 4 + 6 = 10. Next, we are told that two more storks join the group, so the new total number of birds on the fence is 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 storks sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 3 birds and 4 crows sitting on the fence. So, if we add 6 more crows, how many birds will be added in total? Since each crow takes up one spot, no birds will be added. Therefore, the total number of birds and crows on the fence is: 3 + 0 = 3 birds and 4 + 6 = 10 crows.  The final answer is 3 birds and 10 crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 birds of other species sitting on the fence, so we can start by counting those.  6 birds x 1 bird per hole = 6 holes.  Next, we know that there are 3 crows sitting on the fence as well.  3 birds x 1 bird per hole = 3 holes.  Now, let's add the two new crows to the equation.  2 birds x 1 bird per hole = 2 holes.  So, in total, there are 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 holes where birds are sitting on the fence.
Response:  First, we know that there are 4 birds and 3 crows on the fence. Next, we add 6 more crows to the fence. So, in total, how many crows do we have?  6 + 3 = 9 crows! Therefore, there are 9 crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  First, there were 6 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds joined them. Next, 8 crows came along and perched on the fence as well. So, in total, how many birds are sitting on the fence?  6 + 4 = 10 (birds) + 8 = 18 (crows) = 28 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  First, we know that there are 2 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 5 more birds join, so the total number of birds on the fence is 2 + 5 = 7. Next, 4 crows join, so the total number of birds on the fence is 7 + 4 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 2 more birds join them, so now there are 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Next, 6 crows join them, bringing the total number of birds to 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  First, there were 5 birds (A). Then, 3 more birds joined (B), so now there are 5 + 3 = 8 birds in total (C). Finally, 4 more birds joined (D), bringing the total number of birds to 8 + 4 = 12 birds. Therefore, the correct answer is 12 birds.
Response:  First, we know that there were 6 crows and 2 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds joined them. So, in total, how many birds are there now?  6 (crows) + 2 (birds) + 3 (more birds) =?  Yes, that's right! There are 11 birds sitting on the fence altogether.
Response:  First, we know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 6 crows and 2 more birds join them. So, in total, there are 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the fence now. Therefore, there are 11 - 3 = 8 crows sitting on the fence.
Response:  First chapter has 48 pages and second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, we can say that:  48 - 11 =?  The difference between the two chapters is 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.
"Response:  First chapter has  37 pages and second chapter has more than 37 pages. So we can say that second chapter has at least 38 pages (since 37 + 1 = 38). But the problem states that second chapter is ""more than"" first chapter, so it must have at least one page more than 38. Therefore, second chapter has 39 pages."
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter has 60 pages.  Second, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 93.  Therefore, to find out how many pages are in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages:  93 - 60 = 33.  So there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  First, we know that the second chapter has 36 pages.  If the entire book has 67 pages, then the first chapter must have had 67 - 36 = 31 pages.  Therefore, the first chapter is on page 1 to 31.
Response:  First chapter has 66 pages, second chapter has 35 pages and third chapter has 24 pages. To find out how many pages in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, the total number of pages is:  66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 91 pages, second chapter has 23 pages and third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, we can say that: 91 - 23 =?  The difference is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, there are 68 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  First chapter has 35 pages, second chapter has 18 pages and third chapter has 3 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So, we can say that:  18 - 3 = 15 Second chapter has 15 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  First chapter has 53 pages, second chapter has 75 pages, and third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, we can say that:  53 - 21 = 32 The difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the third chapter is 32 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  First, we know that each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, if there are 31 chapters, the total number of pages is:  31 x 61 = 1861 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 10 pages. So, if we multiply 2 (chapters) x 10 (pages per chapter), we get 20 pages. Since the first chapter has 10 pages, the remaining pages must be in the second chapter. Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter is:  10 pages.
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book. Second, we know that the second chapter has 68 pages. Therefore, to find out how many pages the second chapter has, we can simply subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages in the book. In this case, if the first chapter has 81 pages, then the second chapter must have:  81 - 68 = 13 pages.  So, the second chapter has 13 pages.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning, there were 62 campers who boarded the boat. In the afternoon, there were 39 campers who boarded the boat. So, to find out how many more people boarded the boat in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon from the number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning.  62 - 39 =?  The difference is 23. Therefore, 23 more people boarded the boat in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning (午前), there were 52 campers who boarded the boat. In the afternoon (午後), there were 61 campers who boarded the boat. So, to find out how many more people boarded the boat in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of campers in the morning from the number of campers in the afternoon.  52 - 61 = -9  Therefore, there were 9 fewer campers in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, 15 campers boarded the boat. So, if x people boarded the boat in the afternoon, then the total number of campers who boarded the boat would be:  15 + x = 32 (since there were 32 campers in total) Now, let's solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:  15 + x - 15 = 32 - 15 x = 17 Therefore, x = 7 (since 7 + 15 = 17) So, in the afternoon, 7 more campers boarded the boat.
Response:  We know that in the morning, some campers went boating and then in the afternoon, 7 more campers went boating. So, if we add up the number of campers who went boating in the morning and the afternoon, we can find out how many campers went boating in total.   In the morning, there were x campers who went boating (we don't know the exact value of x yet). In the afternoon, there were 7 more campers who went boating. Therefore, the total number of campers who went boating is x + 7. Now, we are given that there were 60 campers in total who went boating. So, we can set up an equation based on this information: x + 7 = 60. To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x + 7 - 7 = 60 - 7. This simplifies to: x = 53. Therefore, there were 53 campers who went boating in the morning.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning, there were 36 campers on the boat. Then, in the afternoon, there were 13 more campers who boarded the boat. Finally, at night, there were 49 more campers who boarded the boat. To find out how many total campers rode the boat, let's add up all of these numbers:  36 + 13 + 49 = 98 Total campers rode the boat.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning (午前), there were 44 campers on the boat. Next, we know that in the afternoon (午後), there were 39 campers on the boat. Finally, we know that at night (夜), there were 31 campers on the boat. To find out how many more people were on the boat in the morning compared to the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of people in the afternoon from the number of people in the morning. So, let's do that:  44 - 39 =?  The result is: 5 There were 5 more people on the boat in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning (午前), there were 53 campers on the boat. Next, we know that in the afternoon (午後), there were 48 campers on the boat. Finally, we know that at night (night), there were 49 campers on the boat. To find out how many more people were on the boat in the morning compared to at night, we need to subtract the number of campers at night from the number of campers in the morning. So let's do that:  53 - 49 = 4  Therefore, there were 4 more people on the boat in the morning than at night.
Response:  First, we know that in the afternoon (午後), there were 34 people who boarded the boat, and in the evening (night), there were 10 people who boarded the boat. So, to find out how many more people boarded the boat in the afternoon compared to the evening, we need to subtract the number of people who boarded the boat in the evening from the number of people who boarded the boat in the afternoon.  34 - 10 =?  Yes, that's right! There were 24 more people who boarded the boat in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  First, we know that in the morning, there were 13 people on the boat and 59 people hiking. So, if we add 13 + 59 = 72 people. In the afternoon, there were 21 people on the boat. Therefore, the total number of campers who boarded the boat is 72 + 21 = 93 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the morning, there were 29 people who went boating and 66 people who went hiking. So, the total number of campers in the morning is 29 + 66 = 95.   In the afternoon, there were 26 people who went boating. Therefore, the total number of campers in the afternoon is 26. Now, let's compare the number of campers in the morning to the number of campers in the afternoon. We can see that the number of campers in the morning (95) is greater than the number of campers in the afternoon (26). So, more campers went boating in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  First, we know that in the morning, there were 41 campers who boarded the boat and 4 campers went hiking. So, if we subtract the number of campers who went hiking from the total number of campers in the morning, we get:  
Total campers in the morning - Number of campers who went hiking = 41 - 4 = 37  Now, let's move on to the afternoon. We know that 26 campers boarded the boat in the afternoon. So, if we add the number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon to the remaining campers from the morning, we get:  
Remaining campers from the morning + Number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon = 37 + 26 = 63  Therefore, a total of 63 campers boarded the boat or went hiking."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 46 campers in total. Secondly, we are told that 43 campers boarded the boat in the morning. Finally, we are asked how many more campers boarded the boat in the afternoon. To find out, we need to subtract the number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning from the total number of campers. So, the difference between 46 and 43 is 3. Therefore, 3 more campers boarded the boat in the afternoon.
Response:  First, Rachel picked 4 strawberries from the tree. That means there are 7 - 4 = 3 strawberries left on the tree. So, there are 3 strawberries left on the tree after Rachel picked 4 of them.
Response:  First, there were 4 apples on the tree.  Now, there are 2 apples left on the tree.  So, Rachel picked  4 - 2 = 2 apples.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from the tree, so there were 7 - 3 = 4 unripe apples left on the tree. Now, we are told that there are 5 apples remaining on the tree, and 3 of them are ripe, so the number of unripe apples is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 unripe apples left on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two ripe apples from the tree, and there are still seven apples left on the tree. If we assume that all of the remaining apples are unripe, then before Rachel picked any apples, there were 7 + 0 = 7 ripe apples on the tree. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree. Second, we know that there were initially 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples on the tree. So, if Rachel picked 6 ripe apples, then there must have been 2 + 6 = 8 apples on the tree in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree, and there are currently 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples left on the tree. So, initially, there were 3 + 2 = 5 ripe apples on the tree.
Response:  First, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. So, there were 7 - 7 = 0 apples left on the tree. Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 2 + 0 = 2 apples on the tree. Therefore, there were originally 0 apples on the tree.
Response:  First, Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree, so there were 2 - 4 = 2 apples left on the tree. Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 2 + 3 = 5 apples on the tree. Therefore, there are 5 apples on the tree after Rachel picked some and new ones grew.
Response:  Rachel started with 52 apples. She picked 2 apples from one of the trees, leaving her with 7 apples left on that tree. So, initially, there were 52 - 2 = 50 apples in total. Now, we need to find out how many apples were on each of the other 51 trees. Since Rachel only picked 2 apples from one tree, all the other trees had at least 2 apples each (since she didn't pick any apples from them). Therefore, the minimum number of apples on each of the other 51 trees is 2. Thus, the total number of apples on all 52 trees is:  50 + (51 x 2) = 50 + 102 = 152 apples.
Response:  Rachel has 3 pear trees and picks 8 pears from each tree, so she collects a total of 24 pears (3 x 8 = 24). Since there are 9 pears left on the trees, there must have been 36 pears in total at the beginning (24 + 9 = 36).
Response:  First, we know that Rachel has four apple trees and she picked seven apples from each tree. So, in total, she picked 4 x 7 = 28 apples. However, there are still some apples left on the trees, so we need to add the number of apples left on the trees to find out how many apples Rachel picked in total. We know that there are 29 apples left on the trees (29 - 28 = 1). Therefore, Rachel picked a total of 28 + 1 = 29 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has 2 more beads than Doug. So if Doug has x beads, then Ed has x + 2 beads. Secondly, we are given that Doug lost some beads in the playground. Therefore, we can let y be the number of beads that Doug lost. Now, we need to find out how many beads Doug had before he lost them. We can do this by subtracting y from his total number of beads. Finally, we want to find out how many beads Ed has now compared to Doug. To do this, we will subtract y from Doug's original number of beads and add y to Ed's total number of beads. Using these equations, we get:  Doug's original number of beads = x + y (since he lost y beads) Ed's total number of beads = x + 2y (since he has 2 more beads than Doug) Now, let's substitute the values we have found into the equation for Ed's total number of beads:  Ed's total number of beads = x + 2y = (x + y) + 2y = x + 3y Since we know that Ed has 19 more beads than Doug, we can set up an equation based on this information as well:  Ed's total number of beads - Doug's total number of beads = 19  Substituting the first two equations into this one gives us:  x + 3y - (x + y) = 19 Simplifying this equation yields:  2y = 19 - x - y Solving for y gives us:  y = 5 Since we know that Doug lost 5 beads, we can find out how many beads he had originally by substituting y = 5 into the first equation:  Doug's original number of beads = x + y = x + 5 = x + 5 Now, we can use the value of x + 5 to find out how many beads Ed has:  Ed's total number of beads = x + 2y = x + 2(5) = x + 10 Finally, we can compare the number of beads Ed has with the number of beads Doug had originally:
Response:  First, we know that Ed has 45 beads and Doug loses 11 beads. So, if we subtract 11 from 45, we get:  45 - 11 = 34  Therefore, Ed had 34 more beads than Doug.
Response:  First, we know that Ed has 6 more beads than Doug. So if Ed has x beads, then Doug has x - 6 beads. Now, we are told that Doug lost 7 beads in the playground. Therefore, Doug currently has (x - 6) - 7 = x - 13 beads. Finally, we are asked how many beads Doug has. So we can substitute x for the number of beads Ed has and solve for the number of beads Doug has: x - 13.
Response:  First, we know that Ed has 5 more beads than Doug. So if Ed has x beads, then Doug has x - 5 beads. Now, we are told that Doug lost 3 beads in the playground. Therefore, Doug has (x - 5) - 3 = x - 8 beads. Finally, we are given that Ed has 27 beads, so we can set up an equation: x = 27 + 5 = 32. Therefore, Doug had 32 - 8 = 24 beads at first.
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 24 more beads than Doug. So if Doug had x beads, Ed had x + 24 beads.   Next, we know that Doug lost 27 beads in the playground. So Doug has x - 27 beads left.  Finally, we know that Ed found 9 beads. So Ed has (x + 24) - 9 = x + 15 beads left.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + 15 =?  Can you solve for x?
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 29 more beads than Doug. So if Doug had x beads, Ed had x + 29 beads. Next, we know that Ed lost 17 beads in the playground. So after losing 17 beads, Ed would have x + 29 - 17 =? beads left. Simplifying and solving for x + 29 - 17, we get x = 12. Therefore, Ed had 12 more beads than Doug before losing any beads in the playground.
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 19 more beads than Doug. So if Doug had x beads, Ed had x + 19 beads. Now, it says that Ed lost some beads in the playground. We don't know how many he lost, but let's assume he lost y beads. So after losing y beads, Ed has (x + 19) - y beads left. Since Ed now has 8 more beads than Doug, we can set up the equation: (x + 19 - y) = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 27 - 3y. Now, we need to find out how many beads Ed lost so that he ends up with 8 more beads than Doug. To do this, we can substitute y = 4 into our equation and solve for x: x = 27 - 3(4) = 27 - 12 = 15. Therefore, Ed lost 12 beads in the playground.
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 91 beads and lost 21 in the playground. So, how many beads does Ed have left?  91 - 21 =?  Yes, that's right! Ed has 70 beads left. Now, let's compare this to Doug's number of beads. We know that Doug had 60 beads. Is Ed's number greater than or equal to Doug's number?  70 >= 60  Yes, Ed's number is greater than Doug's number. Therefore, at that point in time, Ed had 70 beads, which was 10 more than Doug had.
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 12 more beads than Doug. So if Ed had x beads, then Doug would have had x-12 beads. Now, we are told that Ed lost 20 beads in the game. Therefore, Ed has 17 beads left (since he started with 39). This means that Doug also lost 20 - 12 = 8 beads. So, Doug now has x - 8 beads. We can set up an equation based on this information:  17 + (-8) = 39  17 - 8 = 39  17 = 47   Therefore, Doug currently has 47 beads.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 408 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 42 students who proposed adding bacon. Next, we need to find out how many more students proposed adding mashed potatoes than those who proposed adding bacon. To do this, we can subtract the number of students who proposed adding bacon from the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes.   Calculation:  408 - 42 = 366 Therefore, there are 366 more students who proposed adding mashed potatoes than those who proposed adding bacon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are in total 479 + 489 = 968 students who have made suggestions for the menu. Now, let's consider two cases: Case 1: All 479 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu also suggested adding bacon. In this case, the number of students who suggested bacon is equal to the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. Therefore, the difference between the number of students who suggested bacon and those who suggested mashed potatoes is 0. Case 2: Some students who suggested adding mashed potatoes did not suggest adding bacon, while some students who suggested adding bacon did not suggest adding mashed potatoes. In this case, the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. To find out how many more students suggested bacon than mashed potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon. So, let's calculate both numbers first: Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes: 479 Number of students who suggested bacon: 489 Subtracting the smaller number (479) from the larger number (489), we get: 489 - 479 = 10 The answer is 10. Therefore, if all 479 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes had also suggested adding bacon, then there would be 10 more students who suggested bacon than mashed potatoes. However, since some students may have suggested one but not the other, the actual difference could be different.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 310 students in total. Of those, 185 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu, and the remaining 125 students (310 - 185) suggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, there were 125 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 288 students in total. Of those, 264 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, and the remaining 24 students (288 - 264 = 24) suggested adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, there were 24 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu.
Response:  First, we know that there are 457 students in total. Of those, 63 more students proposed adding mashed potatoes than proposing adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who proposed adding bacon is:  457 - 63 = 394.  So, 394 students proposed adding bacon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 182 people in total who made suggestions for the menu. Of those, 166 people suggested adding bacon to the menu, and 14 people (166 - 14 = 152) suggested adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, there are 152 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  First, we know that there are 324 + 374 = 698 students who proposed new food items. Of these, 128 students proposed tomato addition, so we have 698 - 128 = 570 students who did not propose tomato addition. Now, let's find out how many students proposed each of the other two options. We know that 324 students proposed mashed potato addition and 374 students proposed bacon addition. Therefore, the number of students who proposed mashed potato addition is 324, and the number of students who proposed bacon addition is 374. So, the total number of students who proposed one of the three options is 324 + 374 + 128 = 826. Finally, the number of students who did not propose any of the three options is 570.
Response:  First, we know that there are 257 people who proposed adding mashed potatoes to the menu. Second, we know that there are 120 people who proposed adding bacon to the menu. Finally, we know that there are 97 people who proposed adding tomatoes to the menu. To find out how many more students proposed mashed potatoes than those who proposed bacon, we can subtract the number of students who proposed bacon from the number of students who proposed mashed potatoes:  257 - 120 = 137. Therefore, 137 more students proposed mashed potatoes than bacon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 144 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes to the menu, and 467 students who proposed adding bacon. Therefore, the total number of students proposing additions to the menu is:  144 + 467 = 611  Next, we know that 79 students proposed adding tomatoes to the menu. So, the total number of students proposing additions to the menu is:  611 + 79 = 682 Now, let's compare the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes with the number of students who proposed adding tomatoes. We can see that:  144 (mashed potatoes) > 79 (tomatoes) Therefore, more students proposed adding mashed potatoes than proposed adding tomatoes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 23 students who proposed adding tomatoes to the menu, and 337 students who proposed adding bacon. Therefore, the difference between the number of students who proposed adding bacon and those who proposed adding tomatoes is:  
337 - 23 = 314  So, there are 314 more students who proposed adding bacon than those who proposed adding tomatoes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 66 types of food in total. Secondly, we know that 450 students proposed adding mashed potatoes and 38 students proposed adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who did not propose any new food items is:  66 - (450 + 38) = 66 - 488 = 212. So, the number of students who did not participate in proposing new food items is 212.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 218 people who proposed adding mashed potatoes and bacon to the menu, so the number of students who proposed adding only bacon is:  

218 - 351 = 93 
Therefore, 93 students proposed adding only bacon to the menu."
"Response:  First, we know that 269 students proposed bacon and 330 students proposed mashed potatoes. So, if we subtract the number of students who proposed bacon from the total number of students who proposed mashed potatoes, we get:  
330 - 269 = 61  Therefore, there are 61 more students who proposed mashed potatoes than those who proposed bacon."
Response:  First, we know that there are 569 female students and 236 male students in total. To find out how many more female students there are than male students, we can subtract the number of male students from the number of female students:  569 - 236 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  569 - 236 = 333.  So, there are 333 more female students than male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 34 female students and x male students in total. Since the number of male students is greater than the number of female students, we can write an inequality to represent this:  34 < x < 875 (since there are 875 male students) Now, let's find out how many more male students there are than female students. To do this, subtract the number of female students from the total number of students:  x - 34 > 0 We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by x - 34: 1 > 34/x So, what is the value of x? Well, if we divide both sides of the previous equation by 34, we get: x > 34/1 = 34 Therefore, there are at least 34 more male students than female students in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are female. Therefore, we can find out how many male students there are by subtracting the number of female students from the total number of students:  
485 - 232 =?  The result is:  
485 - 232 = 253  So, there are 253 male students in the school."
Response:  First, we know that there are 697 female students and 228 more female students than male students. So, if we subtract 228 from 697, we get the number of male students.  697 - 228 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 469 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 635 female students and x male students in total. We also know that there are 510 more male students than female students. So, we can write an equation based on this information:   Female Students = 635 (x - 510) Male Students = x + 510 Total Students = 635 + (x - 510) To solve for x, we can add both sides of the equation:  635 + x + 510 = 635 + (x - 510) Combine like terms:  2x + 510 = 635 + x - 510 Subtract x from both sides:  2x = 1245 Simplify:  2x = 1245 / 2 x = 622 Therefore, there are 622 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 868 female students and x male students in total. We also know that the number of female students is 281 more than the number of male students. So, we can write an equation based on this information:   Female Students = Male Students + 281  Now, let's substitute the value of female students (868) into the above equation:  868 = Male Students + 281  Subtracting 281 from both sides gives us:  687 = Male Students  Therefore, there are 687 male students in the school. 
Response:  First, we know that there are 700 female students and x male students in total. We also know that the number of male students is 142 more than the number of female students. So, we can write an equation based on this information:   Female Students + Male Students = Total Students  Female Students = 700  Male Students =? (since we want to find out how many male students there are)  Now, let's substitute the value of female students into the second equation:  Female Students + Male Students = Total Students  700 + Male Students = Total Students  Since the total number of students is given as 842, we can solve for the number of male students:  700 + Male Students = 842  Subtracting 700 from both sides gives us:   Male Students = 142  Therefore, there are 142 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 706 female students and 222 male students in total. Next, we know that 418 more female students have enrolled in the school. So, to find out how many students are currently enrolled in the school, we need to add the original number of female students (706) to the new number of female students (418). Therefore, the total number of female students is:  706 + 418 = 1124  And since we already know that there are 222 male students, the total number of students currently enrolled in the school is:  1124 + 222 = 1346
Response:  First, we know that there are 902 female students currently enrolled in school. If 44 more girls join the school, then the total number of female students becomes:  902 + 44 = 946 females.  So, there are now 946 female students attending the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 632 male students and 410 female students in total. Next, we know that 465 more female students have enrolled in the school. So, to find out how many more female students than male students there are, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students who have enrolled.   Total students = 632 + 410 = 1042 Female students enrolled = 465 Male students enrolled =? To find out how many male students enrolled, we can subtract the number of female students enrolled from the total number of students who have enrolled.  1042 - 465 = Male students enrolled = 577 Therefore, there are 577 male students and 465 + 410 = 875 female students in the school now. The difference between the number of female students and male students is:  875 - 577 = 298 So, there are 298 more female students than male students in the school now.
Response:  First, we know that there are 732 + 682 = 1414 female students in total.  Next, we know that there are 761 male students. Therefore, the total number of students is 1414 + 761 = 2175. Finally, we can see that there are 8 male students, so the number of female students is 2175 - 8 = 2167.  So, there are currently 2167 female students enrolled in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 135 female students and 214 male students currently enrolled in the school.  Next, we know that 496 more female students and 910 more male students have just entered the school.  To find out how many male students are currently enrolled, we can add the number of male students already enrolled (214) to the number of new male students who have just entered (910).   Therefore, the total number of male students currently enrolled is:  214 + 910 = 1124  So, there are 1124 male students currently enrolled in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 308 female students and 318 male students in total. So, the total number of students is:  308 + 318 = 626  Next, we know that there are 36 teachers. Therefore, the total number of people in the school (students and teachers) is:  626 + 36 = 662
Response:  First, we know that there are 315 female students and 309 male students, so the total number of students is:  315 + 309 = 624 students. Next, we know that there are 772 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is:  624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396 people.
Response:  First, we know that there are 402 more female students than male students. This means that if there were no male students, there would be 402 more female students. So, to find out how many male students there are, we can subtract 402 from the total number of female students.   Total number of female students = 739 - 402 = 337  Therefore, there are 337 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 458 more female students than male students. This means that if there were no male students, there would be 458 more female students. So, to find out how many male students there are, we can subtract 458 from the total number of female students.   Total number of female students = 692 Subtracting 458 from 692 gives us:  Male students = 692 - 458 = 234 Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 362 men and 257 women in school now.   Next, we know that 403 more women have enrolled in the school. So, to find out how many more women than men there are, we need to add the number of women who have enrolled (403) to the original number of women (257).   Therefore, the total number of women in the school is:  257 + 403 = 660   Since there were already 362 men in the school, and 660 - 362 = 338 more women than men.
Response:  First, Edward spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left.   Therefore, Edward now has $2.
"Response:  First, we know that Edward had $13 and he spent some money.  Now, he has $3 left. So, if we subtract the amount he has now ($3) from what he had originally ($13), we can find out how much he spent:  
$13 - $3 = $10  Therefore, Edward spent $10."
Response:  First, Edward spent $9, so he had $9 - $9 = $0 left. Then, he spent another $8, so he had $0 - $8 = $-8 left. Finally, he has $17, so we can say that he started with $-8 + $17 = $9. Therefore, Edward had $9 before he spent any money.
Response:  First, Edward had $6. Then he spent $16 to buy 92 books at the same price. So, how much did he spend?   $$ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Price per book} $$ $$ \text{Total amount spent} = 92 \times 16 $$ $$ \text{Total amount spent} = 1532 $$ Therefore, Edward spent $1532. Now, let's find out how much money he had before spending any money.  $$ \text{Money left after buying books} = \text{Initial amount of money} - \text{Total amount spent} $$ $$ \text{Money left after buying books} = 6 - 1532 $$ $$ \text{Money left after buying books} = -1526 $$ Since the result is negative, it means that Edward had less than $6 before buying the books. In fact, he had $-1526$ dollars less than $6$.
Response:  Edward has $12 and he spent $6 to buy two books. So, how much did each book cost? We can set up an equation based on the information given:  6 = 2x (where x is the cost of one book) Since Edward spent $6 in total, we know that 2x = 6. Solving for x, we get:  x = 3 Now we know that each book costs $3.
Response:  First, Edward spent $6 for a book, so he had $19 - $6 = $13 left. Then, he spent $16 for a pen, so he had $13 - $16 = $0 left. Therefore, before using his money, Edward had $13.
Response:  First, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so he spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7. Now, he has $12 - $7 = $5 left. So, Edward used $7 for books and pens.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $16 for books and $8 for pens, so he has $19 - ($16 + $8) = $19 - $24 = $5 left.   Since he spent more money on books than on pens, we can say that he spent at least $5 more on books than on pens. Therefore, the difference between how much he spent on books and how much he spent on pens is at least $5.  So, if we let x be the number of dollars he spent on pens, then he spent at least $5 + x dollars on books.  We know that he has $5 left, so we can set up an equation:  5 + x <= 19  Solving for x, we get:  x >= 14  Therefore, Edward spent at least $14 on books and no more than $5 on pens.
Response:  First, Edward spent $17. Then he received $10 from his friends, so he has $17 - $10 = $7 left now. Therefore, before spending any money, Edward had $17.
Response:  First, we know that Zakari did 44 push-ups. Next, we know that David did 58 more than Zakari. So, if we add 58 to 44, we get:  44 + 58 = 102  Therefore, together, Zakari and David did 102 push-ups.
Response:  First, we know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did. So, if we subtract 44 (the number of push-ups David did) from 51 (the number of push-ups Zachary did), we get:  51 - 44 = 7  Therefore, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
"Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups today in gym class.  If David did more than Zakari, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.  44 - Z = 9 Where ""Z"" represents the number of push-ups that Zakari did.  Solving for Z, we get:  Z = 35 So, Zakari did 35 push-ups today in gym class."
Response:  First, we know that David did 51 push-ups today in gym class. Next, we are told that David did more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did at least x + 1 push-ups. Now, let's find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We can set up an equation based on this information:  51 = x + (x + 1) Since both sides of the equation must equal the same number of push-ups, we can simplify it as follows:  2x + 1 = 51 Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:  2x = 50 Solving for x, we get:   x = 25 Therefore, Zachary did 25 push-ups. So, together, David and Zachary did 51 + 25 = 76 push-ups.
Response:  First, we know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and David did more than Zachary, so David did at least 59 + 1 = 60 push-ups.   Next, we know that Zachary did 44 sit-ups, and David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary, so David did at most 44 - 27 = 17 sit-ups.  Therefore, David did a total of 60 (push-ups) + 17 (sit-ups) exercises.
Response:  First, we know that David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary in total. This means that if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 29 push-ups. Now, we also know that David did 13 fewer crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did y crunches, then David did y - 13 crunches. We can set up two equations based on this information:   Equation 1: x + (x + 29) = 44 (since both Zachary and David did 44 push-ups in total)   Equation 2: y - (y - 13) = 17 (since both Zachary and David did 17 crunches each) Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: x = 26 (since Zachary did 26 push-ups) y = 30 (since Zachary did 30 crunches) Therefore, David did 30 - 13 = 17 crunches.
Response:  First, we know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.  Next, we know that David did more push-ups than Zachary, so let's subtract 17 from 53 to find out how many push-ups David did:  53 - 17 = 36  Now, we know that David did 36 push-ups. We also know that he did fewer crunches than Zachary, so let's subtract 10 from 14 to find out how many crunches David did:  14 - 10 = 4  So, David did 36 push-ups and 4 crunches.
"Response:  First, we know that David did fewer crunches than Zachary. So if David did x crunches, then Zachary did x + 87 more crunches (since he did 87 fewer). Now, we also know that Zachary did more push-ups than David. So if Zachary did y push-ups, then David did y - 58 fewer push-ups. We can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  
Zachary did more push-ups than David, so let's say Zachary did y push-ups and David did y - 58 push-ups.  Since Zachary did more push-ups, his total number of exercises is greater than David's. So we can write:  
y > y - 58  Simplifying this inequality, we get:  
2y > 58  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
y > 29  Therefore, Zachary did at least 29 push-ups. But we also know that he did 35 push-ups, so our final answer is:  
Zachary did 35 push-ups."
Response:  First, we know that David did more push-ups than Zachary (38 more).   Second, we know that Zachary did more crunches than David (62 fewer).  So, if we subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of crunches Zachary did, we get:   Crunches - Push-ups =?   We can fill in the blank with the correct number:  58 - 38 = 20  Therefore, Zachary did 20 more crunches than David.
Response:  First, we know that David did more push-ups than Zachary. Second, we know that John did fewer push-ups than David. Third, we are given that Zachary did 19 push-ups. So, if we subtract the number of push-ups done by Zachary from the total number of push-ups done by David, we can find out how many push-ups David did. Here is the calculation: Total number of push-ups done by David = Number of push-ups done by David - Number of push-ups done by Zachary Total number of push-ups done by David = 39 + (19 - 13) = 39 + 6 = 45 Therefore, David did 45 push-ups.
"Response:  First, we know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 22 push-ups.  Next, we know that John did 4 fewer push-ups than David. So if David did x + 22 push-ups, John did x + 22 - 4 = x + 18 push-ups.  Finally, we are told that Zachary did 51 push-ups. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + 18 = 51  Solving for x gives us:  x = 33  Therefore, John did 33 push-ups."
Response:  First, we know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 39 push-ups.  Next, we know that John did 9 fewer push-ups than David. So if David did x + 39 push-ups, then John did x + 39 - 9 = x + 28 push-ups.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  Zachary did x push-ups  David did x + 39 push-ups  John did x + 28 push-ups  We want to find out how many push-ups Zachary did, so we can substitute x for the variable in the first equation:   x + 28 = x + 39  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  28 = 39 - x  Subtracting x from both sides again gives us:  28 = 9  Solving for x, we get:  28 / 9 = x  x = 3  Therefore, Zachary did 3 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that David did 37 reps of arm raises and Zachary did 30 reps. To find out how many more reps David did than Zachary, we can subtract the number of reps that Zachary did from the number of reps that David did:  
37 - 30 =?  Answer:  7  So, David did 7 more reps than Zachary."
Response:  First, we know that David did 38 reps of arm raises. Next, we are told that Zackary did more than David, so we can start with the fact that Zackary did at least 39 reps (since David did 38). Finally, we are asked for the total number of arm raises done by both David and Zackary. To find this, we add the number of reps done by each boy:  38 + 39 = 77.  So, the total number of arm raises done by both boys is 77.
Response:  First, we know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zakari. So if Zakari did x push-ups, then David did x + 40.  Next, we know that David did 17 fewer sit-ups than Zakari. So if Zakari did y sit-ups, then David did y - 17.  Now we have two equations:  x + (x + 40) = y - 17  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 34  Therefore, David did 34 push-ups and 34 - 17 = 17 sit-ups.
"Response:  First, we know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 36 push-ups. We also know that Zachary did 58 push-ups in total. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: x + (x + 36) = 58 To solve for x, we can first combine like terms: 2x + 36 = 58 Subtracting 36 from both sides gives us: 2x = 22 Now dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 11 So Zachary did 11 push-ups and David did 11 + 36 = 47 push-ups.  
Therefore, Zachary did 47 - 11 = 36 more push-ups than Zachary."
Response:  First, we know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zakari. So if Zakari did x push-ups, then David did x + 27 push-ups.  Next, we know that David did 7 fewer crunches than Zakari. So if Zakari did y crunches, then David did y - 7 crunches. Now we have two equations: x + (x + 27) = y - 7 and solve for x and y.   Solution: We can start by solving the first equation for x: x + (x + 27) = y - 7 x + y - 7 = 0 Subtracting y from both sides gives us: 2x + 20 = 0 Solving for x, we get: x = -10 Now we can substitute this value of x into the second equation to find y: y - 7 = x + (x + 27) y - 7 = (-10) + ((-10) + 27) y = 17 Therefore, Zakari did 17 crunches and David did 10 crunches.
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. To find out how many more pages she did in math than in reading, we need to subtract the number of pages she did in reading from the number of pages she did in math. So, let's do that:  5 - 2 =?  That gives us our answer! Rachel did 3 more pages of math than she did of reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. To find out how many more pages she did for reading compared to math, we can subtract the number of pages she did for math from the total number of pages she did for reading. So, if she did x pages for math, then she did 4 - x pages for reading. Since she completed all her reading homework, we know that 4 - x = 4. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?
Response:  Firstly, Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework.  Secondly, she has to complete x pages of reading homework, where x is the number of pages that she did not finish.  Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel needs to complete is:  5 + x  We know that Rachel must complete at least 7 pages in total, so we can set up an equation:   5 + x = 7  Solving for x, we get:  x = 2  So, Rachel needs to complete 2 more pages of reading homework to fulfill her obligation.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel did not have to do more than 7 pages of math homework. Secondly, she had to do 4 pages more of math homework than reading homework. Finally, we are asked how many pages of reading homework Rachel had to do. So, let's start with the information that Rachel did not have to do more than 7 pages of math homework:  7 ≤ x (the number of pages of math homework)...(1) Now, we know that Rachel had to do 4 pages more of math homework than reading homework, so we can write: x + 4 = y (where y is the number of pages of reading homework)...(2) We also know that Rachel did not have to do more than 7 pages of math homework, so we can substitute equation (1) into equation (2): x + 4 ≤ y...(3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: x + 4 ≤ 7 Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us: x ≤ 3 Therefore, Rachel had to do at most 3 pages of reading homework.
Response:  Firstly, Rachel did not complete her math homework (8 pages). Secondly, she completed more than 3 pages of reading homework. Therefore, we can say that Rachel completed at least 3 + x pages, where x is the number of pages she completed in math homework. Since she didn't complete the entire math homework, x < 8. So our equation becomes:  3 + x <= 8  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  3 + x = 8   x = 5  Therefore, Rachel completed at least 5 pages of homework.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel did not complete her math homework (8 pages). Secondly, she had to do 6 more pages of reading homework than math homework. Therefore, if she had completed all of her reading homework, she would have done 6 + 8 = 14 pages in total. Since she only completed 8 pages of math homework, it means she did not complete any reading homework. So, the answer is 0 pages.
Response:  If Rachel did not complete her math homework (10 pages), and she completed 3 more pages of reading homework than she would have if she had completed her math homework, then we can set up an equation to represent the situation as follows:   Math Homework: 10 pages Reading Homework: x + 3 (where x is the number of pages Rachel would have completed if she had finished her math homework) Total Homework: 10 + x + 3 So, the total number of pages Rachel completed is 10 + x + 3. Now, let's find out what value of x makes this equation true. We know that Rachel completed 3 more pages of reading homework than she would have if she had finished her math homework, so we can write:   x = 3 + y (where y is the number of pages Rachel would have completed if she had finished her math homework) Substituting this into the first equation, we get:  10 + x + 3 = 10 + (3 + y) + 3 Simplifying, we get:   2 + y + 3 = 13 Solving for y, we get:   y = 7 Since Rachel completed 3 more pages of reading homework than she would have if she had finished her math homework, she completed 7 + 3 = 10 pages in total. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel did not have to do any math homework (2 pages). Next, she had to read 3 pages of her reading assignment. Finally, she had to do 10 pages of biology homework. So in total, Rachel had to do 3 + 10 = 13 pages of homework.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. So far, so good! Now, let's look at the biology homework. We know it was 96 pages long. But wait, if she didn't have to do any reading homework, then she must have spent all her time on biology homework! Therefore, the number of pages Rachel did for biology is equal to the total number of pages she did for all three subjects combined. In other words, 9 + 2 + x = 96, where x is the number of pages Rachel did for biology. Solving for x, we get x = 84. So, Rachel did 84 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages she did for math compared to reading, we can subtract the number of pages she did for reading from the number of pages she did for math: 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, Rachel did 7 more pages of math than she did for reading.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  11 + 2 = 13 pages. Next, we are told that she also had 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel had to do is:  13 + 3 = 16 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had 11 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of math homework. So, if we add those two numbers together, we get:  11 + 7 = 18 Next, we are told that she also had 8 more pages of biology homework than she did in math homework. So, if we subtract 7 from 8, we get:  8 - 7 = 1 Now, we need to find out how many pages of biology homework Rachel had. To do this, we can multiply the number of pages of math homework (7) by the difference between the number of pages of reading homework and the number of pages of math homework (11 - 7 = 4):  7 x 4 = 28 Therefore, Rachel had 28 pages of biology homework. Finally, we want to know how many pages of reading homework Rachel had compared to her biology homework. We can compare the number of pages of reading homework (11) to the number of pages of biology homework (28): 11 < 28 So, Rachel had fewer pages of reading homework than she did of biology homework. In other words, Rachel had more biology homework than reading homework.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading homework. So far, she has completed 9 + 11 = 20 pages. Next, we are asked how many more pages she needs to complete for biology. The problem states that she needs to complete 29 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel needs to complete is 20 (pages already completed) + 29 (biology homework remaining) = 49 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading homework. So far, we have:  8 + 7 = 15 pages  Next, we are told that she also had 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages is:  15 + 3 = 18 pages  So, Rachel had 18 pages of homework in total.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to do 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading homework. So far, we have:  5 + 10 = 15 pages. Next, we are told that she also had to do 6 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages is:  15 + 6 = 21 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel completed 2 pages of reading homework and 4 pages of math homework. To find out how many more pages she did in math than in reading, we can subtract the number of pages she did in reading from the number of pages she did in math. So, if she did x pages of reading and y pages of math, we can say:  2 = x - y  Since we know that she did 2 pages of reading, we can substitute this value into the equation above:  2 = 2 - y  Solving for y (the number of pages she did in math), we get:  2 = y  Therefore, Rachel did 2 more pages of math than she did of reading.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to do 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of math homework.  So, if we subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of math homework, we can find out how many more pages of math homework she had to do.  4 pages (reading) - 7 pages (math) =?  To solve for the difference, we can add 4 and 7: 4 + 7 = 11.  Therefore, Rachel had to do 11 more pages of math homework than reading homework.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, let's do that:  6 (morning) - 2 (afternoon) =?  The difference between the two numbers is... 4! That means Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the afternoon.  6 (morning) - 8 (afternoon) =?  So, Jack received 2 fewer emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and x more emails in the afternoon. In total, he received 4 + x emails that day. Since we know that Jack received 5 emails in total, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  4 + x = 5  Now, let's solve for x. We can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:   x = 5 - 4  x = 1  So, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening, for a total of:  6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails.
Response:  First, Jack received 5 emails in the morning.   Next, he received 8 emails in the afternoon.  So, if we add 5 and 8 together, we get... (pause for dramatic effect)...13! That's right, folks - Jack received a total of 13 emails today!
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning, 5 emails in the afternoon, and 8 emails at night. To find out how many emails he received overall, we can add up these numbers:  4 + 5 + 8 = 17 So, Jack received 17 emails in total.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning, 4 emails in the afternoon, and 8 emails at night. To find out how many emails Jack received overall, we need to add up these numbers:  3 + 4 + 8 = 15 So, Jack received 15 emails in total.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received in the daytime is:  10 + 7 = 17  Next, we know that Jack received 17 emails at night. So, the total number of emails he received throughout the day is:  17 + 17 = 34 Therefore, Jack received 34 emails throughout the day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails at night, so we can start by subtracting 7 from 9 to find out how many more emails he received in the morning than at night:  
9 - 7 = 2 So, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than at night."
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails in the daytime (morning plus afternoon). He also received 4 emails in the evening. So, he received 15 + 4 = 19 emails in total. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the daytime than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails that day.
Response:  First, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning.   Next, he received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon.  To find out how many emails Jack received in total, we need to add the number of emails he received in the morning and the afternoon.  3 + 5 = 8 So, Jack received 8 emails in total.
Response:  First, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 5 + 6 = 11 communications in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 9 + 7 = 16 communications in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 communications that day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. That's a total of 10 + 12 = 22 pieces of mail. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails and 44 letters. That's a total of 3 + 44 = 47 pieces of mail. So, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning. Specifically, he received 47 - 22 = 25 more emails in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. That's a total of 6 + 8 = 14 communications in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters, for a total of 2 + 7 = 9 communications in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 14 + 9 = 23 communications during the day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and sent 91 letters. Next, we know that he received 2 emails in the afternoon and sent 74 letters. So, let's add up all the email numbers:  6 + 2 = 8 emails received.  Now, let's add up all the letter numbers:  91 + 74 = 165 letters sent.  Therefore, Jack received 8 emails and sent 165 letters that day.
Response:  First, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 emails. So, the total number of emails he received is 4 + 2 = 6. In the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 emails. Therefore, the total number of emails he sent is 8. So, Jack sent 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day.
"Response:  First, Jack received 7 emails in the morning.   Next, he received more than 7 emails in the afternoon.  So, the total number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is greater than 7.  But we don't know exactly how many more emails he received.  Therefore, our answer is ""more than 7"" emails."
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning. So, the total number of emails he received in the morning is 5 + 3 = 8. Next, we are told that he received 16 emails at night. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received during the day is 8 + 16 = 24.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, for a total of 9 emails so far. If he received 1 more email that day, it would be in the evening. So, Jack received 1 email in the evening.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 12 inches (the given value). Next, we need to find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper. To do this, subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the frog jumped:  12 - 9 =?  The difference between the two distances is 3 inches. So, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  First, we know that Batta jumped 31 inches and Frog jumped 35 inches. So if we add their jumps together, we get:  31 + 35 = 66 inches.  Therefore, the total distance they jumped is 66 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the cricket. So if the cricket jumped x inches, then the frog jumped x + 17 inches.  Next, we know that the mouse jumped 15 inches fewer than the frog. So if the frog jumped x + 17 inches, then the mouse jumped x - 15 inches.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  Cricket (x) + Frog (x + 17) = Mouse (x - 15)  Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  x = 28  Therefore, the cricket jumped 28 inches, the frog jumped 45 inches (28 + 17), and the mouse jumped 20 inches (28 - 15).
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the bat. So if the bat jumped x inches, the frog jumped x + 18 inches. Next, we know that the mouse jumped 2 inches fewer than the frog. So if the frog jumped x + 18 inches, the mouse jumped x + 16 inches (since 2 is less than 18). Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Bat: x + 18 = Frog: x + 16 Mouse: x + 16 We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: x + 34 = x + 16 This simplifies to: 2x + 34 = 16 Solving for x gives us: x = 10 The bat jumped 10 inches, and the frog jumped 10 + 18 = 28 inches. The mouse jumped 10 + 2 = 12 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the bat. So if the bat jumped x inches, the frog jumped x + 10 inches. Next, we know that the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. So if the frog jumped x + 10 inches, the mouse jumped (x + 10) + 20 = x + 30 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the bat.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 39 inches more than the chiriguire. So if the chiriguire jumped x inches, then the frog jumped x + 39 inches. Next, we know that the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. So if the frog jumped x + 39 inches, then the mouse jumped (x + 39) - 94 = x + 39 - 94 = 25 inches. Therefore, the answer is 25 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 32 inches (the distance between the frog and the bat). Next, we know that the mouse jumped less than the frog by 26 inches (the difference between the mouse and the frog). Therefore, the mouse jumped 32 - 26 = 6 inches.   So, the mouse jumped 6 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the cricket. Next, we know that the mouse jumped 5 inches fewer than the cricket. So if we subtract 5 from 24 (the distance the cricket jumped), we get the distance the mouse jumped: Mouse = Cricket - 5 = 24 - 5 = 19 inches. Now we can find out how much farther the frog jumped than the mouse: Frog = Mouse + (Frog - Mouse) = 19 + (33 - 19) = 19 + 14 = 33 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the mouse.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Batta jumped 13 inches. Secondly, we are told that Batta jumped 2 inches farther than Kae...
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 35 inches. Next, we are told that the bat jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. So, to find out how far the bat jumped, we can add 4 inches to the distance the frog jumped:  35 + 4 = 39 inches  Therefore, the bat jumped 39 inches. Now, let's calculate the total distance both animals jumped:  35 (frog) + 39 (bat) = 74 inches  The total distance both animals jumped is 74 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Batta jumped 19 inches. Secondly, we know that Batta is more than 4 inches away from Frog and less than 44 inches away from Mouse. So, if we subtract 4 inches from 19 inches, we get 15 inches (19 - 4 = 15). Now, let's check if this distance is greater or equal to the distance between Frog and Mouse. We know that the distance between Frog and Mouse is 44 inches minus the distance between Frog and Batta, which is 15 inches. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  44 - 15 = 29 inches.  So, the distance between Frog and Mouse is 29 inches, and the distance between Batta and Frog is 15 inches.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Batta jumped 39 inches. Secondly, we know that Batta jumped farther than Kawazu (Kawazu is Japanese for ""frog"") by 19 inches. Lastly, we know that Nezumi (Nezumi is Japanese for ""mouse"") jumped shorter than Kawazu by 12 inches. So if we subtract 12 from 19, we get 7. Therefore, Nezumi jumped 7 inches less than Kawazu. Now let's add 7 to 39, and we get 46. Thus, Nezumi jumped 46 inches."
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 21 inches.  Next, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog.  So, if the frog jumped 21 inches, then the mouse jumped 21 - 16 = 5 inches.  Now, we need to find out how far the lizard jumped compared to the mouse. We know that the lizard jumped 25 inches more than the frog. So, if the frog jumped 21 inches, then the lizard jumped 21 + 25 = 46 inches.  Therefore, the lizard jumped 46 inches, which is 9 inches more than the mouse.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches. So, to find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the frog jumped. In this case, we can do that by subtracting 17 from 39:  39 - 17 = 22  Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Batta jumped 9 inches. Secondly, we know that Mouse jumped less than Batta by 3 inches. Finally, we know that Frog jumped farther than Batta by 33 inches. So, if we subtract the distance that Mouse jumped from the distance that Batta jumped, we get:  9 - 3 = 6 inches   Now, let's add the distance that Frog jumped to this result:  6 + 33 = 42 inches Therefore, Mouse jumped 42 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the cricket. So if the cricket jumped x inches, the frog jumped x + 37 inches.  Next, we know that the mouse jumped less than the frog by 16 inches. So if the frog jumped x + 37 inches, the mouse jumped x - 16 inches. Finally, we are told that the cricket jumped 14 inches. So we can set up an equation based on these facts:  x + (x + 37) - 16 = 14  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2x + 37 = 14 + 16 2x + 37 = 30  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, the mouse jumped 10 inches.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to make a total of 14 cups.  Second, we know that there are 6 cups of sugar in the recipe, and since Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, she still needs to add 1 cup of flour to reach the total amount of 14 cups.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of flour to the mixture.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, so she needs to add 11 - 4 = 7 more cups of sugar.   Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 cups of sugar.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has already added some cups of flour, and she needs 8 cups more than the recipe requires. So, if the recipe requires 6 cups of flour, Mary needs 6 + 8 = 14 cups of flour in total. Therefore, she still needs to add 14 - 6 = 8 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some cups of flour and needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. So if she needs 7 cups of sugar, she will need 7 + 2 = 9 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary should add 9 - x (the number of cups of flour she has already added) cups of flour, where x is the number of cups of flour she has already added. Since we don't know how many cups of flour Mary has already added, we can let x be any positive integer from 0 to 9. Then, we have:  9 - x = 2 + x  Simplifying the equation:  9 - x = 2x + 2  Solving for x:  2x + 2 = 9  Subtracting 2 from both sides:  2x = 7  Dividing both sides by 2:   x = 3  Therefore, Mary has already added 3 cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, so she needs to add 6 - 3 = 3 more cups of flour.  Therefore, the total amount of flour needed for the recipe is 11 + 3 = 14 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some cups of flour and she needs 2 more cups of flour to make the cake. So, if she has already added x cups of flour, then she needs 2 + x cups of flour in total. Since we are told that the recipe requires 12 cups of flour, we can set up an equation as follows:  2 + x = 12  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and she needs 2 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar.  To make the cake according to the recipe, she needs 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar.  So, how many more cups of flour does she need?   We can subtract what she has from what she needs:  9 - 3 = 6  Therefore, Mary needs 6 more cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar.  To make the cake according to the recipe, she needs 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar.  So, she still needs to add  5 - 2 = 3 cups of sugar.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, so she needs to add 12 - 11 = 1 cup more.   Therefore, Mary still needs to add one cup of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to reach the total amount of 10 cups.  To find out how much more flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has from the total amount needed:  10 - 7 = 3 So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to reach the total amount of 12 cups.  To find out how much more flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount needed (12 cups):  12 - 2 = 10 cups So, Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, so she needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (8 - 5 = 3). Therefore, Mary should add 3 cups of sugar to the mixture.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar.  Second, the recipe calls for a total of 13 cups of sugar.  Third, we need to find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add.   To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount of sugar needed (13 cups):  13 - 2 = 11 cups  So, Mary still needs to add 11 cups of sugar to make the cake.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the recipe.  Second, the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar in total.  So if she has already added 4 cups of sugar, she needs to add  9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour to make up for it.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour to the recipe.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to make a total of 9 cups (as specified in the recipe).  To find out how much more flour she needs, let's subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:  9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups So, Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, so she needs to add 5 - 11 = 4 cups of sugar.   Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of sugar to make the cake.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some cups of flour and needs 3 cups of sugar. If she had enough flour, she wouldn't need to add more. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  3cups + x = 10cups (where x is the number of cups of flour Mary still needs) Now we have two variables, 3 and x. To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:  10 - 3 = x 7 = x Therefore, Mary needs 7 more cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added some cups of flour, so she needs to add more cups of flour to make a total of 13 cups.  Since she has already added some cups, let's subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total number of cups needed.  13 - x = 12 (where x is the number of cups Mary has already added)  Now solve for x.  x = 13 - 12  x = 1  So, Mary has already added one cup of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar.  To make the cake according to the recipe, she needs 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.  So, how many more cups of flour does she need?   We can subtract the amount she already has from the total amount needed:  14 - 7 = 7  Therefore, Mary needs 7 more cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar.  So, if the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour, she needs to add more sugar but not flour.   Next, let's calculate how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount called for in the recipe:  11 - 10 = 1 cup more sugar.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup more sugar to make the cake.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to reach the total amount of 10 cups required in the recipe. To find out how much more flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:  10 - 6 = 4 cups.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to reach the total amount of 14 cups.  Second, we know that there are 9 cups of sugar in the recipe, and since Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, she still needs to add 5 cups of sugar (9 - 4 = 5).  Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of sugar and 6 cups of flour (14 - 4 = 6) to complete the recipe.  
So, the answer is 5 cups of sugar and 6 cups of flour."
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add more flour to reach the total amount of 7 cups.  Second, we know that there are 5 cups of flour left to be added, and each cup of flour contains 160 grams of flour (since there are 8 ounces in a cup). Therefore, Mary needs to add  5 x 160 = 800 grams of flour.  So, the answer is 800 grams or 8 cups of flour.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, so she needs to add less than 9 cups of salt (since there are 9 cups of salt in the recipe).  Now, let's look at the sugar amount. There are 11 cups of sugar in the recipe, and since Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, she needs to add more than 11 - 12 = 1 cup of sugar.  Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the cake batter.  Second, according to the recipe, she needs to add a total of 7 cups of sugar.  Third, since she has already added 4 cups, she still needs to add  3 more cups of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).  So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to the cake batter.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the recipe.  So, if the recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar, she needs to add  12 - 10 = 2 more cups of sugar.  Now, let's look at the flour. The recipe requires 14 cups of flour, and Mary has already added 10 cups of flour.  Therefore, she needs to add  14 - 10 = 4 more cups of flour.  To summarize, Mary needs to add 2 cups of sugar and 4 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 19 bird families living near the mountain and 60 bird families have flown away. So, the number of bird families left behind is:  60 - 19 = 41. Therefore, more than 41 bird families have flown away.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are initially 87 bird families in the mountain near the village. Secondly, if 7 bird families fly away during winter, then the number of bird families left behind is 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, the remaining bird families after 7 fly away are 80.  

Question: What if more than 7 bird families flew away? For example, if 12 bird families flew away, how many bird families would be left behind?  Answer: If 12 bird families flew away, then the number of bird families left behind can be calculated as follows: 87 - 12 = 75. So, if 12 bird families flew away, there would be 75 bird families left behind."
Response:  We know that in total, there were 34 bird families (20 + 14).  Since some of them migrated and some remained, we can deduce that half of the total number of bird families migrated.   Half of 34 is 17, so 17 bird families migrated.  Therefore, 17 - 14 = 3 bird families remained near the mountain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 23 families of birds flew to Africa and 37 families of birds flew to Asia. So, if we subtract 23 + 37 = 60 families of birds from the total number of bird families living near the mountain (85), we get:  85 - 60 = 25 families of birds left near the mountain. Therefore, there are 25 families of birds left near the mountain after 23 and 37 families fly away.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain. Secondly, we know that 42 birds flew to Africa and 31 birds flew to Asia. So, if we subtract the number of birds that flew to Asia from the total number of birds, we get the number of birds that flew to Africa.  42 - 31 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 11 more bird families in Africa than in Asia.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 38 bird families near the mountain. Secondly, we know that 47 bird families flew from Africa and 94 bird families flew from Asia. Finally, we need to find out how many more bird families flew from Asia compared to Africa. To do this, we can subtract the number of bird families that flew from Africa (47) from the number of bird families that flew from Asia (94): 94 - 47 = 47. Therefore, there are 47 more bird families that flew from Asia than from Africa.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 bird families near the mountain and 38 bird families in Africa. Therefore, the total number of bird families that flew to Africa is 38 + 18 = 56. Next, we know that 80 bird families flew to Asia. So, the total number of bird families that migrated this winter is 56 + 80 = 136.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 bird families living near the mountain currently. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families will be:  87 + 18 = 105 Now, let's count how many birds each family has on average. We can assume an average of 4 birds per family, so:  105 families x 4 birds/family = 420 birds In conclusion, if 18 new bird families with an average of 4 birds per family join the existing 87 families, there will be a total of 420 birds living near the mountain.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 49 families of birds living near the mountain before winter. Then, 59 families of birds fly away for the winter, leaving how many families of birds remaining? To find out, subtract 59 from 49: 49 - 59 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 20 families of birds remaining near the mountain after winter.  
Now, let's add the 24 new families of birds that arrived from the North Pole. How do we add them to the previous number? We simply add 24 to 20: 20 + 24 =?  That gives us a total of 44 families of birds remaining near the mountain after winter."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 41 families of birds living near the mountain. Next, we are told that 27 families flew away for the winter. Therefore, the number of families remaining near the mountain is:  41 - 27 = 14. So, there are 14 families of birds remaining near the mountain during the winter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 45 bird families in the mountain near the village. Secondly, 86 birds flew away for winter. Thirdly, we need to find out how many more bird families are left after 86 birds flew away. To do this, we subtract the number of birds that flew away (86) from the original number of bird families (45): 45 - 86 = -41 So, there are 41 fewer bird families left in the mountain near the village after 86 birds flew away for winter. Therefore, the answer is 41.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 bird families in total near the mountain. Of these, 35 bird families flew to Asia and 62 bird families flew to Africa. Therefore, the number of bird families flying to Africa is 62 - 35 = 27 more than the number of bird families flying to Asia.   So, the answer is 27.
Response:  We know that there are three bird families living near the mountain and two of them have flown south for the winter. So, if we subtract 2 from 3, we get 1. Therefore, one bird family is left near the mountain.
Response:  First, Paul received 253 boxes of crayons as birthday gifts. Second, he lost or gave away 70 boxes during the school year. Therefore, at the end of the school year, Paul had 253 - 70 = 183 boxes of crayons left.
Response:  First, we know that Paul received 551 crayons in total. Second, we know that he lost or gave away all but 177 of them by the end of the school year. So, to find out how many crayons Paul received on his birthday, we need to subtract the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year (177) from the total number of crayons he received (551). Doing so gives us:  551 - 177 = 374 Therefore, Paul received 374 crayons on his birthday.
Response:  First, Paul received 440 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift. Then, he gave 111 boxes to his friends and lost 106 boxes. So, how many boxes of crayons does Paul have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of boxes given away (111) from the total number of boxes he received (440): 440 - 111 = 329. Therefore, Paul has 329 boxes of crayons left.
Response:  First, Paul received 65 boxes of crayons as birthday gifts, which is equal to 65 x 10 = 650 crayons.  Next, he gave his friends 213 boxes of crayons, which is equal to 213 x 10 = 2130 crayons.  Finally, he lost or was given 16 boxes of crayons, which is equal to 16 x 10 = 160 crayons.  Therefore, the total number of crayons that Paul had at some point during the school year is:  650 + 2130 - 160 = 2840 crayons.
Response:  First, Paul received 589 boxes of crayons as birthday gifts. He gave 571 boxes to his friends and lost 161 boxes. To find out how many more crayons he has than what he lost, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he received:   Total crayons = 589   Crayons given away = 571   Crayons lost = 161   Subtracting the number of crayons lost from the total number of crayons gives us:   Total crayons - Crayons lost = 589 - 161 = 428 So, Paul has 428 more crayons than what he lost.
Response:  Paul received 110 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift and gave 90 boxes to his friends. This means he has 20 boxes left (110 - 90 = 20). However, he lost 412 crayons in total (20 x 20 = 400 + 12). Therefore, Paul lost more than twice the number of crayons he gave away (412 > 90 x 2 = 180). So the answer is 132 (412 - 180).
Response:  First, Paul received 563 crayons as a birthday gift. Then, he gave 558 crayons to his friends. So, how many crayons did he have left? We can calculate this by subtracting the number of crayons he gave away from the total number of crayons he received:  563 - 558 = 332. Therefore, Paul had 332 crayons left after giving them away.
Response:  First, Paul received 52 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift. He gave 535 boxes to his friends. So, he has 492 boxes left (535 - 52 = 492). Now, let's calculate how many crayons he lost or gave away:  Lost or given away = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons left  = 535 - 492 = 43 Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 43 boxes of crayons.
"Response:  First, we know that Paul received 521 pencils and 66 erasers at his birthday party.  Second, we know that he had 154 erasers left at the end of the school year.  Third, we can assume that some or all of the pencils were used during the school year (since there are only 154 erasers left).  Fourth, we want to find out how many pencils were used or lost during the school year.   To do this, we need to subtract the number of pencils Paul had at the beginning from the number of pencils he had at the end.  In other words, we need to subtract 521 from whatever number represents the number of pencils he had at the end of the school year.  Finally, since we know that Paul had 154 erasers left at the end of the school year, we can add the number of erasers he had at the beginning (66) to the number of pencils he had at the end to get our final answer.  So let's start with the equation for the number of pencils Paul had at the end of the school year:   Pencils at end = Pencils at begin - Pencils used/lost During the school year We know that Paul had 521 pencils at the beginning, so we can set up the equation as follows:   Pencils at end = 521 - x Where ""x"" is the number of pencils used or lost during the school year. Now we need to solve for ""x"".  To do this, we can use the information that Paul had 154 erasers left at the end of the school year.  Since each eraser was used to sharpen one pencil, we can divide the number of erasers by the number of pencils needed per eraser to find out how many pencils were used or lost during the school year:   x = (154 erasers) / (1 pencil per eraser) = 154 / 1 = 154 pencils were used or lost during the school year.  Therefore, the number of pencils Paul had at the end of the school year is:"
"Response:  First, Paul received 531 pens and 38 erasers as birthday gifts. At the end of the school year, he had not lost any erasers and had 391 left over. This means that he used up all 531 pens and had none left. Therefore, Paul used more pens (531) than erasers (391).  
So, the difference between the number of pens and erasers is:  
Pens - Erasers = 531 - 391 = 140  
Therefore, Paul used 140 more pens than erasers."
Response:  First, we know that Paul received 601 pencils and 406 erasers as birthday gifts. We also know that he had 336 erasers left at the end of the school year. To find out how many more erasers he had than pencils, we can subtract the number of pencils from the number of erasers:  601 - 336 = 265  So, Paul had 265 more erasers than pencils.
Response:  Firstly, Paul received 315 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift. Since he lost or gave away all but 291 of them, we can deduce that he had 315 - 291 = 24 excess crayons.   Therefore, Paul received 24 crayons as a birthday gift.
Response:  First, Paul received 267 markers on his birthday.   Next, he lost 231 markers during the school year. This means that he has 267 - 231 = 36 markers left. Finally, he gave 308 markers to his friends. So, the number of markers he gave to his friends is 308 - 36 = 272 markers. Therefore, the difference between the number of markers he gave to his friends and the number of markers he lost is:  272 - 231 = 41 markers.
Response:  First, Paul received 457 erasers and 320 pens.  If he had no erasers left at the end of the school year, that means he used up all 457 erasers.  So, he must have used 457 - 1 = 456 erasers.  Now, let's look at the number of pens he has.  He has 320 pens, and since he didn't use any erasers, he still has all 320 pens.  Therefore, Paul has more pens (320) than erasers (456).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 11 customers at the restaurant.  Secondly, some of them left after eating, leaving behind 3 customers who remained.  So, if x is the number of customers who left, then 11 - x is the number of customers who remained. Now, let's find out how many customers left. We are given that 3 customers remained, so we can set up an equation as follows:  11 - x = 3 To solve for x, we can subtract both sides from 11:  11 - x = 3 11 - x = 3 + x Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  2x = 8 x = 4 Therefore, 4 customers left the restaurant.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 3 customers and one of them left. So, now there are 2 customers left. Now, if another customer leaves, there will be only one customer left. Therefore, the number of customers who remained after one customer left is 1.
Response:  First, we know that 9 people left after eating. So, if there were x customers initially, then 9 + x - 9 = 12 (since 12 people are remaining). Simplifying this equation, we get x = 6. Therefore, there were 6 customers initially.
Response:  First, we know that there were initially 14 customers.  Then, 5 customers left, so the number of remaining customers is:  14 - 5 = 9.  Therefore, the waiter currently has 9 customers.
Response:  First, we know that there were initially 13 customers, and some of them left afterward. So, if 4 new customers arrived later, then the total number of customers at the end would be:  13 + 4 = 17  Now, we are told that the waiter still has 9 customers. Therefore, we can subtract the number of new customers (4) from the total number of customers at the end to find out how many original customers left:  17 - 4 = 13  So, 13 original customers left.
Response:  First, we know that there were 12 customers initially.  Then, 15 people left, so now there are 12 - 15 = -3 customers.  But then, 14 new customers arrived, so now there are -3 + 14 = 11 customers in total.  Therefore, the waiter currently has 11 customers.
Response:  First, we know that there were 3 customers initially. Then, more customers arrived, and there were 8 customers in total. So, if we subtract the initial 3 customers from the total of 8, we get:  8 - 3 = 5 new customers arrived.
Response:  First, we know that there were 8 customers initially.  Then, some of them left, leaving 5 customers remaining. Next, 99 new customers arrived. So, in total, how many customers are there now?  5 + 99 = 104 customers. Now, if we subtract the number of initial customers (8) from the total number of customers (104), we get: 104 - 8 = 96 customers. Therefore, 8 customers left.
Response:  First, we know that the waiter had 12 customers initially.  If some of them left, then he would have had fewer than 12 customers remaining.  Let's assume x customers left.  So, the number of customers he had after some left is:  12 - x  Now, we know that he received 10 new customers.  So, the total number of customers he has now is:  12 - x + 10  To find out how many customers he currently has, we need to solve for x in the above equation.  We can do this by adding both sides of the equation:  12 - x + 10 + x =?  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  22 = x  Therefore, the waiter currently has 22 customers.
Response:  First, Dan bought candy for $2. Then he had $3 left. So, before buying candy, Dan had $5 (since he started with $5).   Now let's calculate how much money Dan spent on candy: Candy cost = $2 Spent on candy = $2 - $3 Left = $2 - $3 = $1 So, Dan spent $1 on candy. Therefore, Dan had $5 before buying candy and spent $1 on it, leaving him with $3.
"Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $4 on something (we don't know what yet).  After he spent the money, he had $3 left. So, if we set up an equation based on this information, it would look like this:  4 - x = 3 Where ""x"" is the cost of whatever Dan bought. To solve for ""x"", we can add 4 to both sides of the equation:  4 + 4 = 3 + 3 Now we have:  8 = 6 + x Solving for ""x"":  2 = x So, the candy bar cost $2."
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $3 x 99 = $297 on candy bars. So he has $4 - $297 = $0 left.   Therefore, the answer is $0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $3 in total for two candy bars. Secondly, each candy bar cost the same amount of money. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  3 = (2 x A) where A is the cost of one candy bar. Now solve for A:  3 = 2A A = 3/2 A = 1.5 So, each candy bar costs $1.50.
Response:  First, we know that Dan has $2 and he buys candies at $3 each. So, if he wants to spend all his money, he will buy as many candies as possible. Now, let's calculate how many candies he can buy with $2:  2 dollars / 3 dollars per candy = 2/3 of a candy (or 2/3 of 6 candies) = 4 candies  Therefore, Dan bought 4 candies.
Response:  First, Dan spent $2 on candy bars, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Next, he spent $3 on chocolate, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Dan has is $2.
Response:  First, Dan spent $7 on candy bars.   Next, he spent $6 on chocolate.  So, in total, Dan spent $7 + $6 = $13.  Therefore, Dan used $13 to buy candy bars and chocolate.
Response:  First, Dan spent $3 on chocolate. Then he spent $6 on candy bars. So in total, he spent $3 + $6 = $9. Therefore, Dan used $9 to buy both the chocolate and the candy bars.
Response:  First, Dan spent $2 on candy bars. Then he spent $3 on chocolate. In total, he spent $2 + $3 = $5. So, he used all of his $5 to buy both items.   Therefore, the answer is zero.
Response:  First, Dan spent $8 on candy bars, so he has $4 - $8 = -$4 left.  But then his friends gave him $5, so he has $4 - (-$4) + $5 = $9 left.   Therefore, Dan has $9 left after buying candy bars and receiving money from his friends.
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $3 on candy bars. So if he had $4 to start with, he must have had $4 - $3 = $1 left after buying the candy bars.   Therefore, the price of each candy bar was $1.
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $3 on candy bars, so he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.   Therefore, the answer is $1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $4 in total to buy two candy bars of the same price. So, the cost of one candy bar is half of $4, which is $2. Therefore, each candy bar costs $2.
Response:  First, Dan spent $3 on chocolate.   Next, he spent $7 on candy bars.  So in total, he spent $3 + $7 = $10.  Therefore, Dan spent $10 more than the amount of money he had ($5).
Response:  First, Dan spent $7 on chocolate.   Next, he spent $2 on candy bars.  So, in total, Dan spent $7 + $2 = $9.
Response:  First, Paul had 115 books.  Then, he sold 78 books at the garage sale.  So, how many books does Paul have left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had:  115 - 78 =?  Yes, that's right! Paul has 37 books left.
Response:  Paul sold 137 books at the garage sale, so he has 105 books left (137 - 105 = 32). Therefore, Paul had 32 books to start with.
Response:  First, Paul sold some books at the garage sale and gave 35 books to his friends. So, he has 108 - 35 = 73 books left. Then, he sold some more books at the garage sale, leaving him with 73 - x books remaining, where x is the number of books he sold. We want to find out what value of x makes this equation true: 73 - x = 62. To do this, we can add 73 and -x:  73 + (-x) = 62 Addition gives us:  73 + (-x) = 62 + 73 Subtracting 73 from both sides gives us:  -x = 9 Now we know that Paul sold 9 books at the garage sale.
"Response:  First, Paul had 50 books. He bought some at the garage sale and now he has 151 books in total. So, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  50 + x = 151 where ""x"" is the number of books Paul bought at the garage sale. Now, let's solve for ""x"". To do this, we need to subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:  50 + x - 50 = 151 - 50 This simplifies to:  x = 101 Books Paul bought at the garage sale. Therefore, Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale."
Response:  Paul had 2 books initially. He sold some at the garage sale and now has 58 books. So, he must have sold some books to end up with 58 books. Since he started with 2 books, we can deduce that he sold 2 - 58 = 56 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 21 books to start with. He sold some at the garage sale, so let's call x the number of books he sold. Then, he bought 42 new books, so he has a total of 21 + x books now. We know that he currently has 15 books, so we can set up an equation:  21 + x = 15 Add x to both sides:  21 + x = 15 + x Subtract x from both sides:  21 = 15 - x Now solve for x:  21 = 15 - x x = 6 So, Paul sold 6 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 71 books before he sold some at the garage sale. After selling some, he has 38 new books left. So, the total number of books he has now is:  71 + 38 = 109 books. Therefore, Paul bought more than 53 books (109 - 53 = 56) because he bought 56 new books after selling some at the garage sale.
Response:  First, Paul sold some books and pens at the garage sale. We know that he had 108 books and 55 pens before the sale, so let's subtract the number of items he sold from the total number of items he had:  108 - x (books) = 66 (remaining books)  55 - y (pens) = 59 (remaining pens)  where x is the number of books sold and y is the number of pens sold. Now we need to find out what values of x and y will make these equations true. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving for x first, we get:  x = 42  Then substituting x into one of the original equations, we get:  108 - 42 = 66  This equation is true, so we have found one value of x. Now let's solve for y:  y = 33  Substituting y into the other equation, we get:  55 - 33 = 59  This equation is also true, so we have found both values of x and y. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books and 33 pens at the garage sale.
"Response:  First, we know that Paul had 106 pens and sold some of them at the garage sale. So, after the garage sale, he has fewer pens than before. We are told that he has 14 pens left. Therefore, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  106 - x = 14 Where ""x"" is the number of pens Paul sold at the garage sale. Now, let's look at the books. Before the garage sale, Paul had 51 books. After the garage sale, he has 82 books left. We can set up another equation to represent this information:  51 + y = 82 Where ""y"" is the number of books Paul sold at the garage sale. Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you use these equations to find out how many pens and how many books Paul sold at the garage sale?"
"Response:  First, Paul had 136 books. He sold some of them at a garage sale and now he has 27 books left. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:  136 - x = 27 Where ""x"" is the number of books that Paul sold. To solve for ""x"", we can add 136 and 27:  136 + 27 = 163 Now we know that Paul sold 163 books at the garage sale."
Response:  First, Paul gave 39 books to his friends. So, he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Next, he sold some books at the garage sale. He has 95 - x books left after selling x books. We want to find out how many books he sold (x). To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  95 - x = 68  Since we know that 95 is equal to 68 + x, we can solve for x as follows:  95 - 68 = x  27 = x  Therefore, Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  First, Paul sold some books and pens at the garage sale. We know that he had 95 books and 153 pens in total. After selling some of them, there were 13 books and 23 pens left. So we can start by subtracting the number of books and pens that Paul sold from the total number he had:   Books sold =? (to find out how many books Paul sold) Pens sold =? (to find out how many pens Paul sold) Now let's use algebra to represent the situation. Let B be the number of books Paul sold, and let P be the number of pens he sold. We know that B + P = 95 (total number of books and pens) and B + P = 153 (total number of books and pens before selling). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: B = 42 (number of books sold) P = 23 (number of pens sold) Now we know that Paul sold 42 books and 23 pens at the garage sale. To find out how much money he made from selling the books, we need to know their price. Let's assume that each book cost $10 on average. Then the revenue from selling the books would be: Revenue from books = Number of books x Price per book = 42 x $10 = $420 Finally, we can add this amount to the revenue from selling the pens to find out the total amount of money Paul made at the garage sale: Total revenue = Revenue from books + Revenue from pens = $420 + ($23 x $10) = $420 + $230 = $650 Therefore, Paul made $650 at the garage sale.
Response:  First, Paul sold some books and pens at the garage sale. We know that he had 143 books and 42 pens to start with. If he sold all of his books, he would have none left. So let's subtract the number of books he sold from 143. 143 - 113 = 30. That means he sold 113 books. Now, we need to find out how many pens he sold. Since he had 42 pens to start with, and he sold 113 books, that means he must have sold half of his pens. 42 / 2 = 21. So Paul sold 21 pens.
Response:  First, Jessica had 10 roses in her garden.  Next, she cut 8 more from her garden and put them in the vase.  So, how many roses are left in the vase?   Solution:  To find out how many roses are left in the vase, we need to subtract the number of roses that Jessica cut from her garden (8) from the total number of roses she had (10).  Therefore, there are 2 roses left in the vase.
Response:  First, Jessica had 16 roses in her garden. She put them in a vase, so now there are 16 + 0 = 16 roses in the vase. Then, she added more roses to the vase, so now there are 16 + x = 23 roses in the vase, where x is the number of additional roses she added. We can set up an equation based on this information:  16 + x = 23  To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:   x = 23 - 16  x = 7  So, there were 7 additional roses that Jessica added to the vase. Therefore, there were originally 16 + 7 = 23 roses in the vase.
Response:  First, Jessica had two roses in the vase. She threw away four roses and put new ones in their place. So she threw away 4 - 2 = 2 roses. Now there are 23 roses in the vase, so she must have cut 23 - 2 = 21 roses. Therefore, Jessica cut 21 roses.
Response:  First, Jessica had 15 roses in the vase. She threw away 33 roses and put new ones in their place. So she threw away 33 - 15 = 18 roses. Now there are 17 roses left in the vase. Therefore, Jessica cut more than 18 + 17 = 35 roses.
Response:  First, Jessica had 21 roses in the vase and she removed 34 roses from the vase. So, she removed 34 - 21 = 13 roses from the vase. Then, she cut new roses from her garden and put them into the vase. She has 15 roses now. Therefore, she cut more than 13 roses (15 - 13 = 2) to fill up the vase with new ones.
Response:  First, Jessica had 7 roses in her vase. She cut some more from her garden and now has 59 roses in total (including the ones in the vase). If she cut x roses from her garden, then she must have had x + 7 roses in her garden before cutting them. Now, there are 20 roses in the vase, so we can set up the equation: x + 7 = 20. Solving for x, we get: x = 13. So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden to put in the vase.
"Response:  First, Jessica had 13 roses in her vase. She cut some from her garden and put them in the vase, so now there are 21 roses in total. But she started with 13 roses in her garden, so she must have cut 8 more to fill the vase. Therefore, there are 8 roses left in her garden.  

So, the correct answer is 8."
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 15 roses and 62 lilies in her garden.  Next, she cut some roses and lilies to put in the vase.  We are told that there are now 17 roses and 96 lilies in the vase.  To find out how many roses Jessica cut, let's use algebra!  Here's one way to do it:  15 (roses) + x (cut roses) = 17 (roses in vase)  Since there were originally 15 roses, if Jessica cut x roses, then there would be 15 + x - x = 15 + x - 15 = x roses left in the garden.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  15 + x - x = 17  Simplifying the equation:  2x = 22  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:   x = 11  So Jessica cut 11 roses from her garden.
Response:  First, Jessica had 12 roses and 2 lilies in her vase. She cut some of the roses and now there are 10 roses left. So she cut 2 roses (12 - 10 = 2). Next, she had 2 lilies before cutting any flowers, and after cutting the roses, she still has 2 lilies. Therefore, she did not cut any lilies (2).
Response:  First, Jessica had 5 roses and 3 lilies in her vase.  She cut 5 more roses from her garden to add to the vase, so now there are 5 + 5 = 10 roses.  There were already 3 lilies, so now there are 3 + 10 = 13 roses.   Therefore, there are currently 13 roses in the vase, and 2 lilies.
Response:  First, Jessica had 7 balloons and 12 orchids in her vase.  Next, she cut 4 balloons and added 8 more orchids to the vase.  So now there are 11 balloons and 20 orchids in the vase.   To find out how many orchids are more than balloons, we can subtract the number of balloons from the total number of orchids:  20 - 11 = 9  Therefore, there are 9 more orchids than balloons in the vase.
Response:  First, Jessica had 3 roses in the vase. She cut some roses from the garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 19 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 16 roses (19 - 3 = 16) to fill the vase with 19 roses.
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 13 roses and 84 tulips in her garden.  Next, she cut some more roses and tulips from her garden to put into the vase.  We are told that there are currently 91 tulips and 14 roses in the vase.  So, let's use algebra to figure out how many roses Jessica cut.  14 (current number of roses) - 13 (original number of roses) = 1 (number of roses cut)  Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from her garden.
Response:  First, Jessica had 16 roses and 3 lilies in her vase. She cut some of them to put more in the vase. So, she must have cut at least 8 roses (16 - 8 = 8) and possibly some lilies as well. Now, there are 7 lilies left in the vase, so she must have cut 3 lilies (7 - 3 = 4). Therefore, Jessica cut 8 roses and 3 lilies.
Response:  First, Jessica had 6 roses and 20 lilies in her garden. She cut some roses and lilies to put in the vase. Now, there are 21 lilies and 22 roses in the vase. We know that Jessica took more lilies than roses because there are more lilies than roses in the vase now. So, let's use algebra to find out how many more lilies Jessica took than roses. We can write an equation based on the information given:   Lilies + Roses = Total Number of Flowers in Vase  Since there are 21 lilies and 22 roses in the vase, we can substitute these numbers into the equation:  21 + 22 = Total Number of Flowers in Vase  Add the two numbers together:  43 = Total Number of Flowers in Vase  Now, we need to find out how many more lilies Jessica took than roses. To do this, we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers in the vase:  43 - 22 =?  Subtract the two numbers:  21 =?  There are 21 more lilies than roses in the vase. Therefore, Jessica took 21 more lilies than roses.
"Response:  First, Jessica had 9 roses and 6 lilies in her vase.  She cut some more roses and lilies from her garden to add to the vase.  So, let's call the number of roses she added ""x"".  Now, there are x roses and 6 lilies in the vase.  Total number of flowers = x + 6.  We know that the total number of flowers is 13 (lilies) + 3 (roses).  Therefore, we can set up the equation:   x + 6 = 13 + 3  Simplifying the equation:   x + 6 = 16  Solving for x:   x = 10  So, Jessica added 10 roses to the vase.  There are now 10 roses and 6 lilies in the vase."
Response:  Robin cut her hair from 17 inches to 13 inches. So she cut 4 inches (17 - 13 = 4) off her hair.
Response:  Robin cut her hair from 20 inches to 10 inches, so she cut off 10 inches of her hair. Therefore, before cutting her hair, Robin had 20 - 10 =  10 inches of hair.
Response:  First, Robin had 16 inches of hair and cut off 11 inches. So she has  5 inches left (16 - 11 = 5). Then, her hair grew by 12 inches, so now she has  17 inches of hair (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Robin's current hair length is 17 inches.
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and she wants to add another 18 inches, then her new length will be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches.  Therefore, if Robin adds another 18 inches to her current length of 19 inches, her new hair length will be 37 inches.
Response:  Robin cut her hair from 14 inches to 13 inches, so she cut off 1 inch of her hair. Therefore, her current hair length is 13 - 1 = 12 inches.
Response:  First, Robin had 14 inches of hair. Then she grew it to 8 inches longer, so her new length was 14 + 8 = 22 inches. Finally, she cut off 20 inches, leaving her with  22 - 20 = 2 inches of hair. Therefore, Robin's current hair length is 2 inches.
Response:  First, Dan has 12 bottle caps in his collection. Next, he found 53 more bottle caps in the park. So, if we add 12 and 53, we get...  12 + 53 = 65! That means Dan now has 65 bottle caps in total.
Response:  First, Danie had 21 bottle caps in his collection. Then he found some more in the park. So, if he has 53 bottle caps now, we can subtract 21 from 53 to find out how many he found in the park:  53 - 21 = 32  Therefore, Danie found 32 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  First, Dan found 63 bottle caps in the park and threw away 51 of them. That means he kept 33 bottle caps. So, initially, Dan had 33 bottle caps.
"Response:  First, Dan found 36 bottle caps in the park and threw away 35 of them. This means he kept 1 bottle cap that was not old.   Next, we know that Dan currently has 22 bottle caps in his collection. So, if he found 36 bottle caps in total, how many did he already have before he went to the park?   We can set up an equation based on this information:  22 + x = 36 where ""x"" is the number of bottle caps Dan had before going to the park. Solving for ""x"", we get:  22 + x = 36  36 - 22 = x  14 = x   Therefore, Dan had 14 bottle caps in his collection before he went to the park."
"Response:  Firstly, Dan found 30 bottle caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he has 42 bottle caps now. To find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than he found, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he had before throwing any away. In this case, that would be:  
63 - 30 = 33  Therefore, Dan threw away 33 more bottle caps than he found."
Response:  First, Danie found 22 bottle caps in the park.  Next, he found 8 pieces of packaging paper.  So, if we add 22 and 8, we get...  22 + 8 = 30.  Therefore, Danie had 30 bottle caps at first.
Response:  First, Danie found 30 wrappers in the park. Then he already had 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. So, if we subtract the number of wrappers he found (30) from the total number of wrappers he has (57), we get:  57 - 30 = 27  Therefore, Danie had 27 wrappers at first.
Response:  First, we know that Dan found 30 bottle caps and 14 pieces of packaging paper in the park.  Next, we know that he already had 7 bottle caps and 86 pieces of packaging paper in his collection before he went to the park.  So, if we subtract the number of items he already had from the total number of items he found, we can find out how many more bottle caps and packaging papers he found.   For the bottle caps, he already had 7, and he found 30 - 7 = 23 more in the park.  For the packaging papers, he already had 86, and he found 14 - 86 = -75 fewer in the park (since he already had all of them).  Therefore, Dan found 23 more bottle caps and -75 fewer packaging papers than he already had.
Response:  First, we know that Dan found 11 bottle caps in the park. Second, he found 28 wrappers. Third, his collection currently has 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers. To find out how many more wrappers Dan found than bottle caps, we can subtract the number of bottle caps from the total number of wrappers:  51 - 11 = 40. So, Dan found 40 more wrappers than bottle caps.
Response:  First, we know that Danie has collected 71 bottle caps and 24 pieces of packaging paper in the park. Next, we know that he currently has 28 bottle caps and 16 pieces of packaging paper in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps Danie has than packaging papers, we can subtract the number of packaging papers from the number of bottle caps:  28 (bottle caps) - 16 (packaging papers) = 12. Therefore, Danie has 12 more bottle caps than packaging papers.
Response:  First, we know that Danie has collected 27 bottle caps and 43 pieces of packaging paper. Now let's look at how many packages he has. If he has 27 bottle caps, it means he has used 27 packages to collect them all (since each bottle cap is packaged separately). And if he has 43 pieces of packaging paper, it means he has used 43 packages to wrap up all his purchases (again, assuming one package per item). Therefore, Danie currently possesses 27 + 43 = 70 packages in total!
Response:  First, we know that Dan lost 66 bottle caps in the park.  Second, we know that he currently has 25 bottle caps in his collection.  So, if we subtract the number of bottle caps he currently has from the total number of bottle caps he had before (i.e., 66), we can find out how many bottle caps he had initially.  66 - 25 =?  Yes, that's right! Dan had 41 bottle caps initially.
Response:  First, we know that Danny had 25 bottle caps before he went to the park.  Second, we know that he found 6 more bottle caps at the park.  So, if we add 25 and 6, we get... (pausing for dramatic effect)...31! That's right, Danny found 31 bottle caps in total!
Response:  First, Danie found 60 old bottle caps in the park and threw them away. This means he had 60 - 60 = 0 bottle caps at first. Then, he found 58 new bottle caps, so now he has 58 + 0 = 58 bottle caps in his collection. Therefore, Danie initially had 58 bottle caps.
Response:  Firstly, Danie found 6 old bottle caps in the park and threw them away. This means he had 6 - 6 = 0 new bottle caps before he started his collection. Then, he found 50 new bottle caps, so now he has a total of 50 + 0 = 50 bottle caps in his collection. Therefore, Danie found 50 - 6 = 44 more bottle caps than he already had.
Response:  Firstly, Danie found 54 old bottle caps in the park and threw them away. This means he had 54 - 54 = 0 new bottle caps before he started his collection.  Next, he found 48 new bottle caps, so he has a total of 54 + 48 = 102 bottle caps now.  Finally, we know that Danie currently has 52 bottle caps in his collection, so he threw away  102 - 52 = 50 bottle caps more than he found in the park.
Response:  First, Danie found 29 bottle caps in the park. Then he already had 42 bottle caps, so he now has a total of 42 + 29 = 71 bottle caps.   Next, he collected 82 pieces of packaging paper. So, he now has a total of 71 bottle caps and 82 pieces of packaging paper. Therefore, Danie initially had 71 bottle caps.
Response:  First, Danie found 39 bottle caps and 66 wrappers in the park.  Next, he already had 16 bottle caps and 68 wrappers in his collection.  So, if we subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he already had from the total number of each item he found, we can determine how many new items he found.   Bottle Caps: 39 - 16 = 23 new bottle caps Wrappers: 66 - 68 = -2 new wrappers (since he already had more wrappers than he found) Therefore, Danie found 23 new bottle caps and no new wrappers.
Response:  First, we know that Dan found 50 bottle caps in the park. Second, he already had 21 bottle caps before he went to the park. So, if we add 50 and 21, we get:  50 + 21 = 71 Third, we know that Dan found 46 wrappers in the park. Finally, we know that he already had 52 wrappers before he went to the park. Therefore, if we subtract the number of wrappers he found from the total number of wrappers he has, we get:  52 - 46 = 6 Fourth, we can see that Dan found more bottle caps than wrappers. Therefore, the difference between the two is equal to the number of bottle caps he found minus the number of wrappers he found:  71 - 6 = 65 So, Dan found 65 more bottle caps than wrappers.
Response:  First, we know that Dan found 65 wrappers in the park. Second, he already had 9 wrappers in his collection before he went to the park. Therefore, the total number of wrappers Dan has is:  65 + 9 = 74 wrappers. Now let's look at the bottle caps. We know that Dan found 5 bottle caps in the park and he already had 31 bottle caps in his collection. So the total number of bottle caps Dan has is:  5 + 31 = 36 bottle caps. Finally, we can compare the number of wrappers and bottle caps to see which one is greater. In this case, there are more wrappers than bottle caps:  74 > 36.  So, Dan found more wrappers (74) than bottle caps (36) in the park.
Response:  First, we know that Danie has 11 pieces of wrapping paper and 12 bottle caps in his collection now.  Next, we know that he found 58 bottle caps and 25 pieces of wrapping paper in the park.   So, if we subtract the number of items he already had from the total number of items he found, we can find out how many more of each item he has.   For the wrapping paper, he already had 11 pieces, so if we subtract 11 from 25, we get:  25 - 11 = 14   Therefore, Danie has 14 more pieces of wrapping paper than he already had.   Now let's do the same for the bottle caps. He already had 12 bottle caps, so if we subtract 12 from 58, we get:  58 - 12 = 46   Therefore, Danie has 46 more bottle caps than he already had.
"Response:  First, we know that Danie has collected 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers in the park.  Next, we know that he already had 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps before going to the park.  So, let's add the number of items he found in the park to his existing collection:  
Wrappers: 18 + 67 = 85 wrappers Bottle Caps: 15 + 35 = 50 bottle caps Therefore, Danie currently has 85 wrappers and 50 bottle caps in his collection."
Response:  We know that Jake has 17 cherries and Steve has fewer than 11 cherries. So we can start by subtracting 11 from 17 to find out how many cherries Steve has:  17 - 11 = 6  Therefore, Steve has 6 cherries.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steven, and Steven has 14 more apples than Jerry. So we can start with these two equations:  
Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steven:  
J = S - 7... (1)  
Steven has 14 more apples than Jerry:  
S = J + 14... (2) Now we have two equations and two unknowns (J and S). Can you solve for J?"
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 18 fewer cherries than Steven, so Steven has 18 more cherries than Jake.  
Secondly, we know that Steven has 13 more cherries than Jerry, so Jerry has 13 fewer cherries than Steven.  
Now let's add up all the information we have to find out how many cherries Jerry has:  
Jerry has 13 fewer cherries than Steven, and Steven has 18 more cherries than Jake, so Jerry has 13 + 18 = 31 cherries.  
Therefore, Jerry has 31 cherries."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer than three more apples than Steven because he only has five apples and Steven has eight more than him. So, if we subtract five from eight, we get three. Therefore, Jake has three more apples than Steven.   Secondly, we know that Steven has five apples, so if we add three to five, we get eight. This means that Jake has eight apples in total. Finally, since Jake has eight apples and Steve has five plus three (eight), which is equal to eight, they both have the same number of apples.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 12 fewer cherries than Steven, so if Steven has x cherries, Jake has x - 12 cherries.   Second, we know that Steven has 11 more cherries than Jerry, so if Jerry has y cherries, Steven has y + 11 cherries.    Finally, we know that Steve has 4 cherries. So let's start with this equation:   x - 12 = y + 11   Now solve for x and find out how many cherries Jake has.  Do you want to try?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer than 7 more than Steven and more than 9 less than Jack. So, if S is the number of strawberries Steven has, then J has (S + 7) strawberries. And if G is the number of strawberries Jack has, then J has (G - 9) strawberries. Now we are given that Steven has 16 strawberries, so S = 16. Substituting this into the first equation, we get J = (16 + 7) = 23. Therefore, Jake has 23 strawberries.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steven, so if Steven has 17 apples, then Jake has  17 - 7 = 10 apples. Next, we know that Jake has 8 more apples than Gill, so if Gill has x apples, then Jake has 10 + 8 = 18 apples. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  10 + 8 = 18  To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:  10 + 8 = 18 10 = 18 - 8 10 = 10 Now we have our answer!  So, Gill has 10 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 9 fewer apples than Steven, so if Steven has x apples, Jake has x - 9 apples.   Secondly, we know that Jake has 18 more apples than Steve, so if Steve has x apples, Jake has x + 18 apples. Now let's equate these two statements: x - 9 = x + 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Steve has 27 apples and Jake has 27 + 18 = 45 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples, Jake will have x - 6 apples.   Secondly, we know that Steve has 18 more apples than Jill. So if Jill has y apples, Steve will have y + 18 apples. Finally, we are given that Jill has 5 apples. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these facts:  x - 6 = y + 18  Now solve for x to find out how many apples Jake has.  Answer:  To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:  x - 6 = y + 18  x = y + 12  Since Jill has 5 apples, we can substitute this value into one of the equations:  x = y + 12  Jake has 5 + 12 = 17 apples.  There are 17 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer than five more apples than Steven. This means that if Steven has x apples, then Jake has x + 5 apples.   Secondly, we know that Steve has 18 more apples than Jerry. So if Jerry has y apples, then Steve has y + 18 apples. Finally, we are given that Jerry has 87 apples. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these facts:  x + (x+5) = y + (y+18) = 87... 2x + 6 = 2y + 36 Now solve for x and y to find out how many apples each person has.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 16 fewer cherries than Steven. So if Steven has x cherries, Jake has x - 16 cherries.   Next, we know that Jill has 12 cherries and is less than both Steven and Jake. So we can set up an equation based on this information:   x (Steven) = x - 16 + 12 (Jill)  Simplifying the equation:   x = x - 4   Solving for x:   x = 18  Therefore, Steven has 18 cherries, Jake has 18 - 16 = 2 cherries, and Jill has 12 cherries.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen because there are 12 fewer apples in Jake's bag. So if Stephen has x apples, Jake has x - 12 apples. We also know that Jake has more oranges than Stephen because there are 79 more oranges in Jake's bag. So if Stephen has y oranges, Jake has y + 79 oranges. Now we have two equations: x - 12 = y and y + 79 =? To solve for x and y, we can add equation (1) to equation (2): x - 12 + y + 79 =? Simplifying, we get 2x + 79 =? Since we know that Jake has a total of 101 fruit (apples plus oranges), we can set up the following equation: 2x + 79 = 101. Solving for x, we get x = 50. Therefore, Jake has 50 apples and 50 + 79 = 129 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer peaches than Stephen (13 less). So if Stephen has 9 peaches, then Jake has  9 - 13 = 4 peaches. Next, we know that Jake has more apples than Stephen (3 more). So if Stephen has 8 apples, then Jake has   8 + 3 = 11 apples. Therefore, Jake holds 4 peaches and 11 apples.
"Response:  First, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen. So if Jake has x apples, then Stephen must have at least x + 6 = 17 apples (since Stephen has 17 apples and Jake has only x). Now, let's look at the number of pears. Jake has more pears than Stephen, so if Jake has x pears, then Stephen must have at most x - 8 = 16 pears (since Stephen has 16 pears and Jake has only x). Therefore, the difference between the number of apples held by Jake and the number of pears held by Jake is:  
x - (x + 6) = -5  Since Jake has fewer apples than Stephen, this means that Jake holds fewer apples than Stephen by 5 pieces."
Response:  First, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen. So if Jake has x apples, then Stephen must have at least x + 3 apples (since Jake only has 3 fewer apples). Now, we also know that Jake has more oranges than Stephen. So if Jake has x oranges, then Stephen must have at most x - 10 oranges (since Jake has 10 more oranges than Stephen). Putting these two inequalities together gives us: x + 3 <= 12 and x - 10 >= 15 Solving for x gives us: x = 9 Apples and x = 2 Oranges Therefore, Stephen has 9 apples and 2 oranges, while Jake has 6 apples and 10 oranges.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven has 12 apples and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has 12 + x apples.   Secondly, we are told that Jake has 67 fewer apples than Steven. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:  
x = 12 - 67  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 12 - 67 = 0  
Therefore, Jake has 0 apples.  Finally, since Steven has 12 apples and Jake has no apples, we can conclude that Steven has all 12 apples."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven has 18 peaches and Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake has  18 - 12 = 6 peaches. Secondly, we know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, Jill has  6 + (-8) = 0 peaches. Therefore, Jill does not have any peaches.
Response:  First, we know that Steven has 19 apples. Next, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven, so Jake has  19 - 12 = 7 apples. Finally, we know that Jill has more apples than Jake, so Jill has 7 + 72 = 89 apples. Therefore, Jake has 7 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven has 14 peaches and Jake has fewer than Steven by 6. So, Jake has  14 - 6 = 8 peaches. Secondly, we know that Jill has more than Jake by 3. Therefore, Jill has  8 + 3 = 11 peaches. Finally, we can conclude that Jill has 11 peaches.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has more apricots than Steven because he has 84 apricots and Steven only has 70. So, Jake has 84 - 70 = 14 apricots more than Steven.   Next, we know that Steven has 13 apricots less than Jake because Steven has 13 apricots and Jake has 97 (84 + 14). Therefore, Jake has 97 - 13 = 84 apricots in total.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has more pears than Steven. So if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x + 17 pears.   Next, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So if Steven has y apples, then Jake has y - 13 apples. Now we have two equations:  x + (x + 17) = y - 13  Simplifying these equations, we get:  2x + 17 = y - 13   Solving for x, we get:  x = 8  Therefore, Jake has 8 apples and 17 pears.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen, so let's subtract the number of apples Jake has from the total number of apples to find out how many more apples Stephen has.   Total apples = 8 + 10 = 18   Number of apples Jake has = 8 - 3 = 5   Therefore, Stephen has 18 - 5 = 13 more apples than Jake.
"Response:  First, we know that Jake has fewer apples than Stephen. So if Jake has x apples, then Stephen must have at least x + 3 apples (since Jake only has 3 fewer apples). Now, we also know that Jake has more oranges than Stephen. So if Jake has x oranges, then Stephen must have at most x - 4 oranges (since Jake has 4 more oranges). We can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  
x + 3 = min(x + 3, x - 4)  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x + 3 = x^2 - 7x + 12  Solving for x, we get:  
x = 8  Therefore, Jake has 8 apples and 12 oranges, while Stephen has 8 + 3 = 11 apples and 8 - 4 = 4 oranges."
Response:  First, we know that Olivia spent $15 at the supermarket. So, she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.   Therefore, Olivia has $63 remaining in her purse.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket.  Second, we know that she has $33 left.  So, if we subtract what she spent from what she has left, we can find out how much money she had originally.   $33 - $78 =?  Can you solve for x?
"Response:  First, Olivia withdrew $148 from the ATM.  Next, she spent some money at the supermarket.  Finally, she had $159 left.   So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:  148 + Spent = 159  We know that Olivia spent x dollars at the supermarket.  Therefore, we can substitute x for ""Spent"" in the equation:  148 + x = 159  To solve for x, we can subtract 148 from both sides of the equation:   x = 159 - 148  x = 11  So, Olivia spent $11 at the supermarket."
Response:  First, Olivia had $3 in her purse before going to the ATM.  She withdrew $49 from the ATM, so she now has $3 + $49 = $52.  After shopping at the supermarket, she spent all of the money she had, leaving her with nothing.  Therefore, the amount that Olivia spent at the supermarket is equal to the amount she had before she went shopping, which is $52.  So, the answer is $52.
Response:  First, Olivia had $53 in her purse before she went to the ATM.  She withdrew $91 from the ATM, so now she has $53 + $91 = $144.  After going to the supermarket, she spent $14.  So, how much did she spend at the supermarket?  We can set up an equation:  144 - x = 14, where x is the amount she spent at the supermarket.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 120.  Therefore, Olivia spent $120 at the supermarket.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $106 in her purse before she went to the supermarket and the shopping mall. After she spent $49 at the shopping mall, she had $106 - $49 = $57 left. Since she only had $26 left after going to the supermarket, we can set up an equation:   $57 - $26 = $31  Solving for the unknown variable ($26), we get:   $26 = $31 - $57  Therefore, Olivia spent $31 at the supermarket.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $54 in her wallet initially.  After she went to the supermarket, she had $29 left.   So, we can calculate how much she spent at the supermarket as follows:  Amount spent = Initial amount - Remaining amount  Amount spent = $54 - $29  Amount spent = $25  Therefore, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket. So, if she had $128 in her wallet initially, how much does she have left?   We can subtract $38 from $128 to find out:   $128 - $38 =?  Can you solve for the remaining amount of money Olivia has?
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 19 apps on his phone and he deleted 5 of them. So, if we subtract 5 from 19, we get:  19 - 5 = 14  Therefore, there are 14 apps left on Dave's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
Response:  Dave had 18 apps and deleted 13 of them. So he has  5 apps left. To find out how many apps Dave had initially, we can subtract the number of apps he deleted from the total number of apps he had:  18 - 13 = 5. Therefore, Dave had 18 apps at first.
Response:  First, Dave had 10 apps on his phone and added 11 new ones. That means he now has 21 apps in total (10 + 11). Next, it says that after deleting some of them, he was left with 4 apps. So we need to find out how many apps Dave deleted. To do this, we can subtract the number of apps he had before adding the new ones from the total number of apps he had after adding them. In other words, we can subtract 10 from 21: 21 - 10 = 11. Therefore, Dave deleted 11 apps.
"Response:  First, Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He added 89 new apps, so he now has 21 + 89 = 110 apps on his phone. Then, he deleted some of them, leaving him with 24 apps. So, if he deleted x apps, he must have had x + 24 = 110 apps on his phone before deleting them. Therefore, the difference between the number of apps he added and the number of apps he deleted is:  

x + 24 - 21 = 110  Simplifying this equation gives us: 

x = 35  So, Dave added 35 more apps than he deleted."
Response:  First, Dave had 15 apps on his phone. He added 71 new apps, so he now has 15 + 71 = 86 apps. Then, he deleted some of them, leaving him with 86 - x apps, where x is the number of apps he deleted. We know that he deleted more than 15 apps because he started with 15 and ended up with 14. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  86 - x = 14 Now solve for x. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can subtract 86 from both sides of the equation:  86 - x = 14 86 - x = 14 - 86 x = 14 - 86 x = -72 x = -72/86 x = -0.82 or x = 82 - 0.82 x = 79.2 So, Dave deleted 79.2 apps (rounded to the nearest whole number).
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 files in total.  After he deleted some apps and files, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files.  To find out how many apps Dave deleted, let's subtract the number of apps he had after deleting from the number of apps he had before deleting:  16 - 5 = 11  So, Dave deleted 11 apps.
Response:  First, Dave had 17 apps and 21 files.  After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files.   To find out how many files Dave deleted, let's subtract the number of files he had after deleting the apps from the total number of files he started with:   Total number of files = 21   Files remaining after deleting apps = 7   So, Dave deleted  21 - 7 = 14 files.
Response:  First, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files.  After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files.   To find out how many more apps Dave has than files, we can subtract the number of files from the number of apps:  21 (apps) - 4 (files) = 17  So, Dave has 17 more apps than files.
Response:  Dave had 19 apps and 18 files initially. He deleted some apps and files, leaving him with 6 apps and 15 files. To find out how many more files he has than apps, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files.  15 - 6 =?  The difference is 9, so Dave has 9 more files than apps.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 17 apps on his phone initially. Then, he added some more, and now he has 18 apps left. So, to find out how many apps Dave added, we can subtract the initial number of apps (17) from the current number of apps (18):  18 - 17 = 1 Therefore, Dave added 1 app to his phone.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 59 files and 15 apps.  After he deleted some files and apps, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files.  To find out how many apps Dave deleted, let's subtract the number of apps he had after deleting files from the total number of apps he started with:  15 - 12 = 3  So, Dave deleted 3 apps.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps on his phone before he deleted some of them.  Next, we know that after deleting some of the apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files.  Now, let's use algebra to solve for how many files Dave deleted.   We can set up an equation based on the information given:  24 - x = 21 (where x is the number of files Dave deleted)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 3  So, Dave deleted 3 files from his phone.
Response:  Dave had 24 apps and 9 files initially. He deleted some apps and files, leaving him with 5 files and 12 apps. To find out how many more apps he has than files, we can subtract the number of files from the total number of apps:  12 (apps) - 5 (files) = 7 So, Dave has 7 more apps than files.
Response:  Dave started with 11 apps and 3 files, so he had a total of 11 + 3 = 14 items.  After deleting some apps and files, Dave was left with 24 files and 2 apps, for a total of 24 + 2 = 26 items.  Therefore, Dave now has 26 - 14 = 12 more files than he did originally.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 242 cards in total. Second, she gave 136 cards to Jeff, so she is left with the remaining cards. To find out how many cards Nel has left, we can subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her total number of cards:  242 - 136 =?  The correct answer is:  106 cards.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 301 cards in total.  Second, she gave 301 - 154 = 147 cards to Jeff.  Therefore, Nel had 147 cards at first.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 528 cards in total and she gave some of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nel is 528 - x, where x is the number of cards given to Jeff. We also know that Jeff had 11 cards before Nel gave him any more cards. Therefore, the sum of the number of cards Nel gave to Jeff and the number of cards Jeff already had is equal to the number of cards left with Nel:  528 - x + 11 = 252  Simplifying the equation, we get:  63 = x  Thus, Nel gave 63 cards to Jeff.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 566 cards and gives some to Jeff. So, Nel has 566 - x cards (where x is the number of cards given to Jeff).  We also know that Jeff has 234 cards initially, so he receives x cards from Nel. Therefore, Jeff now has 234 + x cards.  Now, let's find out how many cards Nel has left after giving some to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards given to Jeff from her original number of cards:  566 - x  Since Nel has 535 cards left, we can set up an equation:  566 - x = 535  To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:  566 = 535 + x  Subtracting 535 from both sides gives us:  231 = x  Therefore, Nel gave 231 cards to Jeff.  So, Jeff currently has 234 + 231 = 465 cards.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 309 baseball cards and 356 10-card packs for a total of 309 + 356 = 665 cards.  Next, we know that she gave some cards to Jeff, leaving her with 415 baseball cards and 149 10-card packs for a total of 415 + 149 = 564 cards.  Now, let's compare the number of baseball cards Nel has left (415) to the total number of cards she had before giving any to Jeff (665):  415 < 665  We can see that 415 is less than 665, so Nel has fewer baseball cards now than she did before giving any to Jeff.  Specifically, she has 250 fewer baseball cards (665 - 415 = 250).
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 246 baseball cards and 214 other cards (not baseball).  So she has in total:  246 + 214 = 460 cards.  Now, she gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so she has:  246 - x cards left (where x is the number of cards she gave to Jeff).  And she also has 214 other cards.  Therefore, the total number of cards she has now is:  460 - x + 214 = 495.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 38.  So Nel has 38 more non-baseball cards than baseball cards.
Response:  First, Nel gave 195 cards to John and Jeff together. So, she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. Next, she gave some cards to Jeff, so she has 378 - x cards left, where x is the number of cards she gave to Jeff. We know that she has 210 cards left now, so we can set up an equation:  378 - x = 210. Solving for x gives us:  x = 168. Therefore, Nel gave 168 cards to Jeff.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 438 baseball cards and 18 special cards for a total of 456 cards.  If she gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, then the number of baseball cards she has left is 438 - x, where x is the number of cards she gave to Jeff.  We also know that she has 18 special cards left, so the total number of cards she has left is 438 - x + 18.  Now, we are told that she has 55 special cards left, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  438 - x + 18 = 55  To solve for x, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:  438 - x = 55 - 18  This simplifies to:  438 - x = 37  Since we know that x is the number of baseball cards Nel gave to Jeff, we can substitute 37 for x in the first equation:  438 - 37 + 18 = 55  Simplifying, we get:   401 = 55  This means that Nel has 55 more baseball cards than special cards.  So, the answer is 55.
Response:  First, we know that Nel has 239 baseball cards and 38 special cards.  Next, she gives some of her baseball cards to Jeff, leaving her with 10 cards and 111 baseball cards.  To find out how many more special cards than baseball cards Nel has, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards she has:  10 + 38 = 48 (total cards) - 111 (baseball cards) = 37 (special cards).  Therefore, Nel has 37 more special cards than baseball cards.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 19 cookies. So, if she had eaten all of them, there would be no cookies left. Therefore, there must have been 19 cookies left before she started eating them.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. Second, we know that after eating some of them, he was left with 7 cookies. So, if we subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had, we can find out how many cookies he ate.  28 - x = 7 (where x is the number of cookies Paco ate) We can solve for x by adding 7 to both sides of the equation.  28 + 7 = 35  Now we have our answer! Paco ate 35 cookies.
Response:  First, Paco had 40 cookies and ate 2 of them. That means he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Next, he bought 37 more cookies. So now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has 75 - 2 = 73 cookies left after eating 2 cookies and buying 37 more.
"Response:  First, Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. That means he has 20 cookies left. Then, he bought 3 more cookies, so now he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Finally, he ate 5 + 3 = 8 cookies more than he had before. So, the final answer is 8.  

Question:  If Paco had 100 cookies and he ate 25 of them, how many cookies would he have left?  Answer:  If Paco had 100 cookies and he ate 25 of them, then he would have 100 - 25 = 75 cookies left."
Response:  First, Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he bought 36 more cookies. In total, he now has 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, Paco bought 47 - 11 = 36 more cookies than he had eaten.
Response:  First, Paco ate 5 cookies.  Then he gave 13 cookies to his friends. So, how many cookies does Paco have left?  5 + 13 = 18 cookies eaten or given away.  That means Paco has 40 - 18 = 22 cookies left.
Response:  First, Paco ate some cookies. He ate 14 out of 17 cookies. That means he has 17 - 14 = 3 cookies left. Next, he gave 13 cookies to his friends. So, he has 3 - 13 = -10 cookies left. But that can't be right! We know he has at least 0 cookies left because we started with 17 cookies. Therefore, our final answer is:  14 + (-10) = 4 cookies.  Yes, Paco ate 4 more cookies than he gave away.
Response:  First, Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them. That means he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. No, that can't be right! He must have eaten all 12 cookies because there is no negative number of cookies. So, Paco ate all 12 cookies and then gave 21 cookies to his friends. Therefore, Paco gave his friends 21 - 12 = 9 more cookies than he had originally.
Response:  First, Paco ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 sour cookies, so he has eaten a total of 15 + 54 = 70 cookies.  Second, he had 22 sweet cookies to start with, so he has 22 - 15 = 7 sweet cookies left.  Therefore, Paco has 7 sweet cookies left.
Response:  First, Paco ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 sour cookies. That means he has eaten a total of 36 + 3 = 40 cookies. Now, let's check how many sour cookies are left. He had 6 sour cookies initially, and he ate 3 of them. So, there are 6 - 3 = 3 sour cookies left. Therefore, Paco has 3 sour cookies left.
Response:  First, Paco ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 sour cookies, so he ate a total of 5 + 2 = 7 cookies. Next, we know that he had 37 sweet cookies and 11 sour cookies in total, so he had 37 + 11 = 48 cookies altogether. Therefore, Paco ate 7 - 48 = 41 too many cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 sour cookies in total. We also know that he had 8 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies to start with. So, let's subtract the number of cookies he started with from the total number of cookies he ate:  20 (sweet) + 34 (sour) = 54 cookies eaten Total cookies eaten - starting cookies = 54 - 8 - 6 = 40 cookies eaten more than starting amount Therefore, Paco ate 40 more sour cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 36 cookies. Second, we are given that there were initially 37 cookies. Therefore, to find out how many cookies Paco left behind, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the initial number of cookies. So, we can say that Paco left behind:  37 - 36 = 1 cookie. 
Response:  First, Paco gave 14 cookies to his friends, so he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Then, he ate 10 cookies, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left. Therefore, Paco has 12 cookies left.
Response:  First, Paco gave 9 cookies to his friends, so he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Next, he ate 18 cookies, so he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate more than 9 cookies (he ate 14).
Response:  First, Paco gave his friends 30 cookies. Then, he ate 23 cookies himself. So, how many cookies did Paco give to his friends? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies that Paco ate from the total number of cookies he had. In this case, we can use subtraction to solve the problem.   Total cookies = 6 (Paco's initial amount) + 30 (cookies given to friends) = 6 + 30 = 36 cookies Now, let's subtract the number of cookies that Paco ate: 36 - 23 =? The result is: 36 - 23 = 13 cookies Paco gave his friends 13 cookies!
Response:  First, Paco ate 15 sweet cookies and 56 sour cookies, so he ate a total of 56 + 15 = 71 cookies.  Since there were originally 97 sour cookies and 34 sweet cookies, we can calculate that Paco has 97 - 56 = 41 sour cookies left and  34 - 15 = 19 sweet cookies left.  Therefore, Paco has 41 sour cookies and 19 sweet cookies left.
Response:  First, Paco ate 14 sweet cookies and 9 sour cookies, so he has eaten a total of 14 + 9 = 23 cookies.  Next, we know that there were originally 26 sour cookies, so there are now 26 - 9 = 17 sour cookies left.  Therefore, Paco has 17 sour cookies left.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 23 sweet cookies and 32 sour cookies, so let's write down what we know:  23 + 32 =?  Now, we are asked how many more sweet cookies he ate than sour cookies. To find out, we need to subtract the number of sour cookies from the total number of sweet cookies:  23 - 32 =?  Finally, we can solve for our answer:  23 - 32 = 9  So, Paco ate 9 more sweet cookies than sour cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 28 sweet cookies and 15 sour cookies. Next, we need to find out how many more sour cookies he ate than sweet cookies. To do this, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies from the total number of sour cookies.  28 - 15 =?  Yes, that's right! Paco ate 13 more sour cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $7 and she spent some amount of money. So, we can write an equation:  7 - x = 5 where x is the amount of money Gwen spent. Now, solve for x.  We know that Gwen has $5 left, so we can set up another equation:  5 + x = 7. Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:   x = 2. Therefore, Gwen spent $2 on something.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gowen received $8 and spent $4. So, she has $8 - $4 = $4 left. Therefore, Gowen received $4 on her birthday.
"Response:  First, Guwen received $2 from her mother. Then, she received an additional $4 from her father, for a total of $6. Next, we know that she spent $3. So, how much money does Guwen have left?  
Answer:  $6 - $3 = $3. Therefore, Guwen has $3 left after spending $3."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Gowen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father, so she has a total of $8 + $5 = $13. Next, we know that she spent $4, so she has $13 - $4 = $9 left. Finally, we are asked if the money she received from her mother is more than the money she received from her father. To determine this, we need to compare $8 with $5. Since $8 is greater than $5, we can say that the money she received from her mother is indeed more than the money she received from her father. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Yes""."
Response:  Firstly, Gowen received $3 from her mother and then she spent $4. So, how much did she have left?   $$ 3 - 4 =? $$  $$ 3 - 4 = -1 $$  Since she had negative money, it means that she owed $1 to her father. Now, let's see how much her father gave her. He gave her $6. Subtracting the amount she owed him ($1), we get: $$ 6 - 1 =? $$  $$ 6 - 1 = 5 $$  Therefore, her father gave her $5 more than what her mother gave her.
Response:  Firstly, Gowen received $5 from her father and then she spent $4. So, how much did she have left?  5 - 4 = $1  Now, let's see what her mother gave her. According to the problem, her mother gave her $7. So, in total, Gowen had $1 + $7 = $8  Therefore, Gowen received more money from her mother than her father.
"Response:  Firstly, Gowen received $5 from her father and then she received $2 more from her mother, so in total, she received $7. Therefore, Gowen received $2 more from her father than from her mother.  

Note: This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that requires you to think creatively and consider all possible perspectives before arriving at the solution."
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 9 beads in his collection initially. Next, we know that he lost some of them, leaving him with only 4 beads now. So, if we subtract the number of beads he has now (4) from the initial number (9), we can find out how many beads he lost:  9 - 4 = 5  Therefore, Josh lost 5 beads.
Response:  First, Josh had 21 beads in his collection.  Then he lost 21 - 12 = 9 beads.  So, there were 9 beads left in his collection after he lost them.   Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  First, Josh had 19 beads in his collection. Then, he lost 11 of them. So, how many beads does he have left?  19 - 11 =?  Yes, that's right! He has 8 beads left. Now, he found 5 new beads. Add 5 to 8 and what do you get?  8 + 5 =?  That's correct! Josh now has 13 beads in his collection.
Response:  First, Josh had 4 beads in his collection. Then, he lost 16 beads. So, after losing 16 beads, he had 4 - 16 = -12 beads left. Next, he found 8 new beads. Therefore, the total number of beads he has now is -12 + 8 = 6 beads. So, Josh lost 12 more beads than he found.
Response:  First, Josh had 7 beads in his collection. Then, he lost 8 beads. So, he had 7 - 8 = -1 beads left. But wait! He found 10 new beads! So, if we add the number of new beads to the negative number of beads he had before, we get:  7 - 8 + 10 = 9 beads.  Therefore, Josh found 9 more beads than he lost.
Response:  First, we know that Josh has 21 marbles in his collection. Next, we are told that he found 7 marbles. So, if we subtract the number of marbles he found from the total number of marbles he had, we can find out how many marbles he has left.  21 - 7 =?  Yes, that's right! Josh now has 14 marbles left in his collection.
Response:  First, Josh gave 2 beads to Jack, so he has 20 - 2 = 18 beads left.   Therefore, Josh now has 18 beads.
Response:  First, Josh had 22 beads in his collection.  Then, Jack gave him 20 more beads. So, now Josh has a total of  22 + 20 = 42 beads in his collection.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 19 beads before he lost some of them. Next, we are told that he lost 11 beads. So, if we subtract 11 from 19, we get:  19 - 11 =?  Yes, that's right! Josh has 8 beads left now.
Response:  First, Josh had 22 beads in his collection.  Then, he found 13 beads.  That means he has  22 - 13 = 9 beads left.  But then it says he lost 5 beads.  So, he has  9 - 5 = 4 beads left.  Therefore, Josh has 4 beads left in his collection.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 15 beads in his collection and he found 9 of them. So, he has 15 - 9 = 6 beads left. Next, we are told that he lost 23 beads. Therefore, he lost 6 + 23 = 30 beads. In total, Josh lost more than twice as many beads as he found (30 - 9 = 21).
Response:  First, Josh had 3 beads in his collection. Then, he found 6 more beads. However, he lost 5 of them. So, how many beads did Josh have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of beads he lost from the total number of beads he found. In this case, we can do that like this:  6 (found) - 5 (lost) =?  The answer is: 6 - 5 = 1.  Therefore, Josh had 1 bead left after finding and losing beads.
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together picked 4 pounds of strawberries. Second, we know that Marco alone picked 19 pounds of strawberries. Third, we want to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed compared to his father's strawberries. To do this, we need to subtract the weight of his father's strawberries from the weight of Marco's strawberries. So let's calculate:  19 pounds - 4 pounds =? pounds More...
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together picked 35 pounds of strawberries. Second, we know that Marco alone picked 13 pounds of strawberries. Third, to find out how much more his father picked than Marco, we need to subtract Marco's picking from their total picking. So, let's do it!  📝 Total picking = 35 pounds (given) - 13 pounds (Marco's picking) =? 🤔 Can you solve for the missing number?
"Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together picked 20 pounds of strawberries. Second, we know that Marco's father picked 17 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco must have picked the remaining amount, which is 20 - 17 = 3 pounds of strawberries.  
So, Marco picked 3 pounds of strawberries."
Response:  First, we know that Marco's strawberries weigh 8 pounds each. So, if he has x strawberries, then he has 8x pounds of strawberries.   Next, we know that his father's strawberries weigh 32 pounds each. So, if he has y strawberries, then he has 32y pounds of strawberries. Now, let's find out how many pounds of strawberries they have in total. We can do this by adding the weight of Marco's and his father's strawberries together. In other words, we add 8x + 32y pounds. Finally, we are asked for the total weight of their strawberries combined. To find this, we simply need to add up all the pounds: 8x + 32y +... (where dots indicate the number of pounds). Therefore, the answer is: 8x + 32y pounds.
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. Next, we are told that Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way home. Finally, we know that Marco has 3 pounds of strawberries left. So, to find out how much strawberries Marco's father has, we need to subtract the amount that Marco lost from the total amount they collected:  24 pounds - 9 pounds = 15 pounds Therefore, Marco's father has 15 pounds of strawberries.
"Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Next, we are told that Marco's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries on the way back home. Therefore, the total amount of strawberries left with Marco is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds. Now, we want to find out how much weight Marco's father has left. We can do this by subtracting the weight of Marco's strawberries from the original total amount they collected. In other words, we can calculate the weight of Marco's father's strawberries as follows:  
Weight of Marco's father's strawberries = Total amount of strawberries collected - Weight of Marco's strawberries  
= 36 pounds - 28 pounds  
= 8 pounds So, Marco's father has 8 pounds of strawberries left."
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together picked 22 pounds of strawberries. Next, we are told that Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries on their way back home. So in total, they have collected 52 pounds (22 + 30) of strawberries. Now, we are asked how much weight Marco's strawberries have now. Since Marco had 22 pounds of strawberries to begin with, he still has those same 22 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries now weigh 22 pounds plus the additional 30 pounds his father found, for a total of 52 pounds.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father went strawberry picking, and the total weight of their strawberries was 37 pounds.  If Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, then the remaining weight must have been carried by his father. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  15 + x = 37  Where ""x"" is the weight of the strawberries carried by Marco's father. To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:  37 - 15 = x  This gives us:  x = 22  Therefore, the weight of the strawberries carried by Marco's father was 22 pounds."
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father together picked 17 pounds of strawberries.  Second, we are given that Marco alone picked 30 pounds of strawberries. Third, we want to find out how much more Marco's strawberries were than his father's strawberries. To do this, we need to subtract the weight of his father's strawberries from the weight of Marco's strawberries.   So, let's calculate:  30 - 17 =?  Yes, that's right! Marco's strawberries were 13 pounds (30 - 17) heavier than his father's strawberries.
Response:  First, we know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds each, so together they weighed 10 x 3 = 30 pounds.  Now, we are told that the total weight of all three strawberries was 26 pounds, so we can set up an equation:  30 + X = 26  Where X is the weight of Marco's father's strawberries.  Solving for X, we get:  X = 4  So, Marco's father's strawberries weighed 4 pounds more than Marco's strawberries.
Response:  First, we know that Marco's father's strawberries were 11 pounds. Next, we know that when you combine Marco and his father's strawberries, they have a total of 30 pounds. Finally, we can find out how much Marco's strawberries weighed by subtracting his father's strawberries from the total amount.   So, Marco's strawberries weighed 30 - 11 = 19 pounds.
"Response:  First, there were two children on the bus to begin with. Then, more children got on at the bus stop, so we need to add that number to the original two. In total, then, there are 2 + x (where x is the number of children who got on at the bus stop) children on the bus now. We know that x is greater than zero because the question states ""more"" children got on at the bus stop. So our equation becomes:  2 + x = 10  Now solve for x.  X = 8  Therefore, there are eight additional children on the bus compared to the original two, for a total of ten children on the bus currently."
Response:  First, there were 26 children on the bus to begin with. Then, at the bus stop, an additional 38 children boarded the bus. So, in total, how many children are currently on the bus?   To find out, we need to add the number of children who started on the bus (26) to the number of children who boarded at the bus stop (38). That gives us: 26 + 38 = 64 children are currently on the bus.
Response:  First, we know that 2 children got off at the bus stop, so there were 2 fewer children on the bus after they got off.  Next, we know that 41 children in total rode the bus, so if we subtract the number of children who got off (2), we get the total number of children who were still on the bus when it arrived at the next stop:  41 - 2 = 39.  Therefore, there were 39 children on the bus before any more children got on or off.
"Response:  First, we know that there were 43 children on the bus to begin with. Next, we are told that some of the children got off at the bus stop, but we don't know exactly how many. Finally, we are told that 21 children remained on the bus after they had stopped. So let's start by subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus:  43 - x = 21 Where ""x"" is the number of children who got off. Now solve for ""x"":  43 - x = 21 Add 43 and 21:  64 = 21 + x Subtract 21 from both sides:  43 = x Therefore, 43 children got off the bus."
Response:  First, we know that 41 children were on the bus to begin with. Next, we know that some children got off at the bus stop, leaving 18 children remaining on the bus. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off (let's say x) from 41, we can find out how many children were originally on the bus:  41 - x =?  Now, let's think about what information we have been given. We know that there were more children on the bus than the 18 who remained after some got off. Therefore, we can set up an equation using this information:  41 - x > 18  To solve for x, we need to turn the inequality into an equality. We can do this by adding x to both sides of the equation:  41 - x + x > 18 + x  Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  2x > 30  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x > 15  Therefore, there were more than 15 children on the bus before some got off. However, since we don't know exactly how many children got off, we cannot determine the exact number of children who were originally on the bus.
Response:  First, there were 21 children on the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus, leaving 11 children on the bus (21 - 10 = 11). Next, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number of children to 16 (11 + x, where x is the number of children who boarded the bus). Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus must have been 5 (16 - 11 = 5), since 5 + 11 = 16. So, 5 children boarded the bus after 10 children got off.
Response:  Firstly, there were 5 children in the bus initially. Then, 63 children got off the bus and 14 more children boarded the bus. So, we need to calculate how many more children boarded the bus than got off.   To do this, let's subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who started with the bus:  5 (initial) - 63 =?  Now, we know that 63 children got off the bus, so if we subtract 63 from 5, we get:  5 - 63 = -58  This means that 58 more children boarded the bus than got off!
Response:  Firstly, there were 36 children who boarded the bus.  Next, 68 children got off the bus, leaving 36 - 68 = 32 children remaining on the bus. However, it is mentioned that some more children got on the bus after those 68 children got off, so we need to add that number to 32. Therefore, the total number of children left on the bus is 32 + x, where x is the number of children who got on the bus after the others got off. Now, let's find out how many children got on the bus after the others got off. We know that the bus started with 36 children and had 32 children left after 68 children got off, so the total number of children who originally boarded the bus is 36 + 32 = 72 children. Since all 72 children did not get off the bus, we can conclude that only 32 children got off the bus, which means that 72 - 32 = 40 children remained on the bus after everyone else got off. So, the correct answer is 40 children.
Response:  Firstly, there were 22 children in the bus initially.  Then, 40 more children boarded the bus at the bus stop, bringing the total number of children to 62 (22 + 40).  Now, some children got off the bus, leaving 2 children behind. So, we need to find out how many children got off the bus.   To do this, we can subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children.  In this case, if x children got off the bus, then 62 - x children would be left on the bus.  Since there are only 2 children left on the bus, we can set up the equation as follows:  62 - x = 2  Solving for x, we get:  x = 60  Therefore, 60 children got off the bus.
"Response:  Firstly, there were 28 children in the bus to begin with. Then, 82 more children boarded the bus at the stop, bringing the total number of children to 110 (28 + 82). However, some children got off the bus, leaving 30 children remaining on the bus (110 - x). We want to find out how many children got off the bus, which is represented by the variable ""x"". To do this, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  28 + 82 = 110 + x  The first term on the left-hand side is 28 + 82, which equals 110. Therefore, the equation becomes:  110 + x = 110 Now solve for x by subtracting 110 from both sides:   x = 10 This means that 10 children got off the bus. So, the correct answer is 10."
Response:  First, we know that there were 23 children on the bus to begin with. Then, 24 children got on the bus at the stop, so now there are 23 + 24 = 47 children in total. Next, some of the children got off the bus, leaving 8 children remaining on the bus. So, if x children got off the bus, then 47 - x children remained on the bus. Finally, we want to find out how many children got off the bus, which is equal to the difference between the number of children who boarded and the number of children who remained on the bus: 47 - x = 8. Solving for x gives us x = 39. Therefore, 39 children got off the bus.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 133 cakes in total. Second, he sold 51 of them. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made, we can find out how many more cakes he has left.  133 - 51 =?  Yes, that's right! He has 82 more cakes than he sold.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has made 54 cakes in total. Secondly, he sold some of them and is left with 13 cakes. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made, we can find out how many cakes he sold.   Thirdly, we are told that Baker sold ""some"" of his cakes. This means that we don't know exactly how many cakes he sold, but we do know that it is less than all of them (54). Therefore, we can use an inequality to represent this information. Finally, we can solve for the unknown quantity (the number of cakes sold) using the equation or inequality we have created.  Based on these steps, here is the solution:  Let X be the number of cakes Baker sold. Since he sold ""some"" of his cakes, we know that X < 54. We also know that Baker has 13 cakes left, so we can write the equation:  54 - X = 13. Solving for X, we get:  X = 41. Therefore, Baker sold 41 cakes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker sold 145 cakes and he still has 72 cakes left. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had, we can find out how many cakes he originally made.   Total number of cakes = Number of cakes sold + Number of cakes left 145 + 72 = 217 Therefore, Baker originally made 217 cakes.
Response:  If Baker has 155 cakes and his friend buys 140 of them, then he is left with  155 - 140 = 15 cakes.  So, Baker still has 15 cakes after his friend buys 140 of them.
Response:  First, Baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them. So, she has 17 (121 - 105) cakes left.   Next, she bought 170 new cakes. So, now she has 34 (17 + 170) cakes in total. Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  Firstly, Baker sold 91 cakes out of 13 he baked, so he has 13 - 91 = 32 cakes left.   Next, he bought 154 new cakes, so in total, he now has 32 + 154 = 186 cakes.  Therefore, Baker bought more than twice as many cakes as he sold (186 - 91 = 95).
Response:  First, we know that Baker sold 78 cakes and bought 31 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of new cakes from the total number of cakes, we get: Total Cakes - New Cakes = 170 - 31 = 139. Therefore, Baker sold 139 more cakes than they bought.
Response:  First, Baker made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. So, she has 75 - 110 = -35 cakes left (since negative numbers indicate how many cakes she still has).   Next, she baked an additional 76 cakes. Therefore, her total number of cakes is now:  35 + 76 = 111 cakes.
Response:  Firstly, Baker baked 144 cakes and sold 71 of them. So, he has 73 cakes left (144 - 71 = 73).   Next, he baked 111 more cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes he has now is 73 + 111 = 184.  So, Baker baked 184 cakes in total, which is 111 more than the number of cakes he sold (184 - 71 = 111).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker has 149 cakes and 91 pastries in total. If he sells 10 cakes and 90 pastries, then he will have fewer items left.   To find out how many cakes Baker has left, let's subtract the number of cakes he sold (10) from the total number of cakes he had (149):  149 - 10 =?  This gives us 139 cakes left.  Similarly, to find out how many pastries Baker has left, let's subtract the number of pastries he sold (90) from the total number of pastries he had (91):  91 - 90 = 1  So, Baker has 1 pastry left.  Therefore, Baker has 139 cakes and 1 pastry left after selling 10 cakes and 90 pastries.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 7 cakes and 148 pastries in total. Second, we know that he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries. So, to find out how many pastries he has left, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made.  148 - 103 = 45 Therefore, Baker has 45 pastries left.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. Next, we know that he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries. So, to find out how many more cakes Baker made than pastries, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made:  126 - 81 = 45  Therefore, Baker made 45 more cakes than pastries.
"Response:  First, we know that Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pies. Next, we know that he sold 70 cakes and 88 pies. To find out how many more pies Baker made than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made. In other words, we can use the equation: Total - Sold = Remaining.  
For cakes: Total (cakes) = 19 + Sold (cakes) = 19 + 70 = 26  
Remaining (cakes) = Total - Sold = 26 - 70 = -44  
Since there are no negative numbers of cakes, we know that Baker did not make any remaining cakes. Therefore, the answer is zero.  Now let's do the same for pies:  
Total (pies) = 131 + Sold (pies) = 131 + 88 = 219  
Remaining (pies) = Total - Sold = 219 - 88 = 131  
So, Baker made 131 more pies than cakes."
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 157 cakes and 169 pastries. Next, we know that he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries. To find out how many more cakes Baker sold than pastries, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the number of cakes he sold.  158 - 147 = 11 So, Baker sold 11 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 54 cakes and 143 pastries. Next, we know that he sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries. To find out how many more pastries Baker sold than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made. In other words, we can use the equation:   Total - Sold = Remaining  For cakes:  54 - 68 = 9 (remaining)  For pastries:  143 - 92 = 51 (remaining)  Since there are more pastries remaining than cakes, we can say that Baker sold more pastries than cakes. Specifically, he sold 51 more pastries than cakes. Therefore, the answer is:  51
Response:  First, we know that Baker sold 44 cakes. Second, we know that she had 48 cakes at first. Now, let's subtract the number of cakes she sold from the total number of cakes she had:  48 - 44 =?  The result is:  48 - 44 = 4. So, Baker has 4 cakes left after selling 44 cakes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker sold 8 cakes and initially made 40 cakes. So, if we subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes, we get:  
40 - 8 =?  The result is:  
32  Therefore, Baker baked 32 more cakes than she sold."
Response:  Firstly, Baker made 169 cakes initially. His friend bought 137 of them, leaving him with (169 - 137) = 32 cakes. So, Baker has 32 cakes left.
Response:  First, Baker made 173 cakes. Then he bought 103 new cakes and sold 86 cakes. So, what does he have left?  173 - 103 + 86 =?   To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of new cakes he bought from the total number of cakes he had (173), then add the number of cakes he sold (86). The result is:  173 - 103 + 86 = 86  Therefore, Baker has 86 cakes left.
Response:  First, we know that Baker baked 99 cakes and sold 89 of them. So, he has 99 - 89 = 10 left.   Next, we know that he bought 167 new cakes. So, in total, he has 10 + 167 = 177 cakes.  Therefore, Baker bought more than 89 cakes (177 - 89 = 88).
Response:  First, we know that Baker baked 8 cakes and sold 139 new cakes. So, he has 8 + 139 = 147 cakes in total. Next, we know that he sold 145 cakes in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he sold and the number of cakes he had before selling them is:  145 - 147 = 2 cakes less than he had before selling them.  So, Baker baked 2 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  First, Baker made 62 cakes and then he made an additional 149 cakes, so in total, he made  62 + 149 = 211 cakes.  Next, we know that he sold 144 of those cakes, leaving him with  211 - 144 = 67 cakes left over.  Therefore, Baker has 67 cakes left over.
Response:  First, Baker made 81 cakes and then he made an additional  92 cakes. In total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes.  Next, we know that he sold 46 of those cakes. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made, we get:  173 - 46 = 127. Therefore, Baker baked more than 127 cakes.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 61 pastries and 167 cakes in total. Next, we know that he sold 108 cakes and 44 pastries. So, to find out how many cakes Baker has left, we can subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made:  167 - 108 = 59  Therefore, Baker has 59 cakes left. Similarly, to find out how many pastries Baker has left, we can subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made:  61 - 44 = 17  Therefore, Baker has 17 pastries left.
Response:  First, we know that Baker baked 56 loaves of bread and 124 cakes. Next, we know that he sold 104 cakes and 29 loaves of bread. So, to find out how many loaves of bread Baker has left, let's subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he baked:  124 - 104 = 20 Now, let's do the same for the bread:  56 - 29 = 27 Therefore, Baker has 20 cakes and 27 loaves of bread left.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes. Next, we know that he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries. Now, let's compare how many more cakes Baker sold than pastries:  102 - 84 = 18 (cakes)  And now, let's compare how many more pastries Baker sold than cakes:  94 - 52 = 42 (pastries) So, to summarize: Baker sold 18 more cakes than pastries, and he sold 42 more pastries than cakes.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. Next, we know that he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. Now, let's subtract how many cakes he sold from how many cakes he made to find out how many cakes he has left:  11 - 140 = -129 (he has none left) And now, let's subtract how many pastries he sold from how many pastries he made to find out how many pastries he has left:  134 - 92 = 42 (he has 42 pastries left) So, Baker made more pastries than cakes. He has 42 pastries left.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 14 cakes and 153 pastries. Next, we know that he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes. So, let's subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made to find out how many pastries he has left:  153 - 8 = 145 Now, let's do the same for the cakes:  97 - 97 = 0! That means Baker has no more cakes left after selling all of them. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes Baker sold and the number of pastries he sold is:  97 (cakes) - 8 (pastries) = 89 To summarize, Baker sold 89 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  First, we know that Baker made 43 cakes and 114 pies. Next, we know that he sold 154 pies and 78 cakes. To find out how many more pies Baker sold than cakes, we can subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of pies he sold:  154 - 78 = 76  So, Baker sold 76 more pies than cakes.
Response:  First, we know that Kerry has 22 games now, so she needs to buy 140 - 22 = 118 more games to have all 140 games.   Next, we can ask how many games Kerry needs to buy in total. We can calculate this by dividing the number of games she needs by the number of games she already has: 118 / 22 = 5 or 6. So Kerry needs to buy either 5 or 6 more games to have all 140 games.
"Response:  If Kerry has 106 games and donates 64 of them, then she has  
106 - 64 = 42 games left.  So there are 42 games left after donating 64 games."
Response:  Firstly, Kerry donated 91 games, so she has 92 - 91 = 1 game left. Therefore, Kerry had 1 game before donating 91 games.
Response:  First, we know that Kerry has 20 Nintendo games and she wants to donate 12 of them. So, we need to find out how many Nintendo games she needs to donate in order to have 70 Sony games left after donating 12 Nintendo games.   To do this, we can use subtraction.  If Kerry has 20 Nintendo games and she donates 12 of them, then she will have 20 - 12 = 8 Nintendo games left.  Now, if she has 8 Nintendo games left and she wants to have 70 Sony games left, then she needs to donate 70 - 8 = 62 Sony games.  Therefore, Kerry needs to donate 12 Nintendo games and 62 Sony games in total.
Response:  First, we know that Kerry has 132 Sony games and she wants to reduce them to 31. So, she needs to get rid of 101 Sony games (132 - 31 = 101).   Next, we know that Kerry already has 46 Nintendo games. If she adds the number of Sony games she needs to get rid of (101) to her current number of Nintendo games (46), she will have a total of 147 games (46 + 101 = 147).  Therefore, Kerry needs to get rid of 116 Sony games (147 - 31 = 116) to reach her goal of having only 31 Sony games left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kerry has 80 games in total and she found 31 more games. So, the total number of games Kerry has is:  80 + 31 = 111 games. Now, if Kerry wants to donate some games, let's say x games, then the number of games she will have left is:  111 - x. To find out how many games Kerry needs to donate so that she has exactly 50 games left (half of her current collection), we can set up an equation:  111 - x = 50. Solving for x, we get:  x = 61. Therefore, Kerry needs to donate 61 games to have exactly 50 games left.
Response:  First, we know that Randi built a tower with 52 blocks. Second, we know that she had some blocks left over, and she had 38 blocks left over. So let's start by subtracting the number of blocks she used from the total number of blocks she had:  52 - 38 =?  Can you solve for x?
Response:  First, we know that Randi has 97 blocks in total and she uses some of them to build a tower. Second, we know that after building the tower, there are 72 blocks left over. So, if we let X be the number of blocks Randi used to build the tower, then we can set up the following equation:  97 - X = 72  To solve for X, we can add 97 and 72:  169 = 2X  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  84 = X  Therefore, Randi used 84 blocks to build her tower.
Response:  First, Randi used 14 blocks to build a tower. That means she has 79 - 14 = 65 blocks left. Next, she used 11 blocks to build a house. So, she has 65 - 11 = 54 blocks left. Therefore, there are 54 blocks left after building both the tower and the house.
Response:  First, Randi used 27 blocks to build a tower.   Next, she used 53 blocks to build a house.  So, in total, Randi used 27 + 53 = 80 blocks.
Response:  First, Randi built a tower using 33 blocks. That means she had 37 - 33 = 4 blocks left over.   Next, she used 13 blocks to build a house. So, she had 4 - 13 = -9 blocks left over.  Since you can't have a negative number of blocks, we know that Randi did not use all 37 blocks. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks she used for the tower and the number of blocks she used for the house is:  33 - 13 = 20.
Response:  First, Randi built a tower using 79 blocks. That means she had 86 - 79 = 7 blocks left over.   Next, she used those 7 blocks to build a house. So, in total, Randi used 79 + 7 = 86 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Randy has 36 blocks to build his tower.  Secondly, he needs 59 more blocks to complete the tower.  So, if we subtract the number of blocks he already has (36) from the total number of blocks needed (59), we can find out how many blocks are left over.  59 - 36 =?  Yes, there are 23 blocks left over!
Response:  First, Randi used 20 blocks to build his house, so he has 95 - 20 = 75 blocks left.   Next, he used 50 blocks to build the tower, so he has 75 - 50 = 25 blocks left. Therefore, Randi used 50 blocks more than he used to build his house.
Response:  First, we know that Randi used 89 blocks to build his house, so he has 90 - 89 = 1 block left over.   Next, we know that he used 63 blocks to build the tower, so he has 90 - 63 = 27 blocks left over after building the tower. Therefore, Randi used 89 + 63 = 152 blocks in total.
Response:  If there are 20 books in total and you have read 5 of them, then you have not read 15 books (20 - 5 = 15).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 books in total that have been read. Secondly, we know that 8 books have not been read yet. Therefore, to find out how many books are in the series, we can subtract the number of books that have been read from the total number of books. So, if we subtract 13 - 8 = 5, then we get 5 as our answer.  
Therefore, there are 5 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series that have not been read yet."
"Response:  First, we know that there are 22 different books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series.  If we have read 12 of them, then we still need to read 10 more books (22 - 12 = 10).   Next, we know that there are 56 movies in total.  Since we have watched 56 movies, we do not need to watch any more movies.  Therefore, we only need to read 10 more books to complete the series."
Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies in total. If we have read 19 books, then we still need to watch 17 - 4 = 13 more movies. Therefore, the answer is 13.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 different books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series and 14 different movies based on those books. If we read 19 books from the series (16 + 3), then we have seen more books than movies. Therefore, the correct answer is:  19 (books) - 13 (movies) = 6. So, there are 6 more books than movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the ""Crazy School"" series.  If we read all 19 books and watch all 61 movies, how many more movies will we have watched than books?   To find out, let's compare the number of books to the number of movies:   Books: 19 Movies: 61 Now, let's subtract the number of books from the number of movies:  61 - 19 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  42  So, if we read all 19 books and watch all 61 movies, we will have watched 42 more movies than books!"
"Response:  We know that there are 10 different books and 11 different movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series. If we read all 10 books and watch all 11 movies, then we have consumed a total of 10 + 11 = 21 items from the series. However, if we only read 13 books (not including any movies), we have consumed 13 items from the series. Therefore, we can see that we have consumed more books than movies. Specifically, we have consumed 13 - 11 = 2 more books than movies. So the answer is 2."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 different books and 17 different movies in total. If we read 7 books, we have missed out on 4 books (7 + 4 = 11). Similarly, if we watch 21 movies, we have missed out on 6 movies (21 + 6 = 17). Therefore, we have watched more movies than we have read books.  
Numeric answer:  We have watched 6 more movies than we have read books."
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series and each book has a different title, then we can assume that there are at least 8 different titles in the series. This means that if we have already read 8 books, we still need to read the remaining 6 books (14 - 8 = 6) to complete the series."
"Response:  First, we know that there are 62 types of books in the ""Crazy Serial School"" series.  If the speaker has read 4 books, then they have not read all 62 books.   Secondly, we know that the speaker has watched 34 movies out of a total of 19 movies. This means that they still need to watch 19 - 34 = 5 movies.  Therefore, the number of books the speaker needs to read is 62 - 4 = 58 books."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies in the ""Crazy Serial School"" series and 21 different books. If we have read 7 books, then we have not seen all of the movies yet. Since there are 4 movies that we have already seen, we need to see 3 more movies to complete the series. Therefore, our answer is 3."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 types of movies and 15 types of books in the ""Crazy Serial School"" series.  If we read 11 books and watched 40 movies, we can calculate how many more books than movies we have consumed.   First, let's count the number of movies and books we consumed: Movies: 40 Books: 11 Now, let's subtract the number of movies from the number of books to find out how many more books we have consumed: Books consumed more than movies = 11 - 40 = -29 So, we have consumed 29 more books than movies."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 17 types of books and 11 types of movies in the ""Crazy School"" series. Secondly, we know that the person has read 13 books and watched 63 movies. Finally, we want to find out how many more movies than books there are. To do this, we can subtract the number of books from the total number of movies. So, let's calculate: Total Movies = 11 x 63 = 703 Books = 17 x 13 = 221 Subtracting the two numbers gives us: 703 - 221 = 482 Therefore, there are 482 more movies than books in the ""Crazy School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 different books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series and 6 different movies based on those books. If we watch all 14 movies, we will have seen every book once. However, if we read all 19 books, we will have read each book twice (once in the original format and once in the movie adaptation). Therefore, by reading all 19 books, we will have consumed more content than we would have by only watching the movies. So, the correct answer is:  19 (books) - 14 (movies) = 5 books more than the number of movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different books and 5 different movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series.  If we watch 19 movies, we can conclude that we have seen all 5 movies once each.  Now, let's look at the number of books we have read. We have read 16 books, which means we have missed 2 books (since we only read 16 out of 18). Therefore, we have watched more movies than we have read books.   Specifically, we have watched 19 movies and read 16 books, so the difference is 3 (19 - 16 = 3)."
Response:  Firstly, Dave has 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys. So, he has 7 - x (number of tickets used for buying toys) tickets left with him, where x is the number of tickets he used for buying toys. Since he still has 2 tickets left, we can set up an equation as follows:  7 - x = 2 Now solve for x. x = 5 Therefore, Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  Dave has 14 tickets left if he used 12 tickets to buy a toy. So, he has 14 - 12 = 2 tickets left.   Therefore, Dave obtained 2 more tickets at the arcade.
Response:  Dave has 18 tickets and he used 5 for toys, so he has  18 - 5 = 13 left. Then, he used 11 more for clothes, so he has  13 - 11 = 2 left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes. In total, he used 12 + 7 = 19 tickets. So, he used 19 - 12 = 7 more tickets for buying clothes than for buying toys.
Response:  Dave has 13 tickets and he uses 8 of them to buy toys. That means he has 13 - 8 = 5 tickets left. He then uses 5 tickets to buy clothes. So, how many more tickets did he use for buying clothes than for buying toys? To find out, we need to subtract the number of tickets used for buying toys from the total number of tickets left. In this case, it would be:  5 (tickets used for clothes) - 8 (tickets used for toys) = 7. Therefore, Dave used 7 more tickets for buying clothes than for buying toys.
Response:  Dave has 14 tickets and loses 2, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he uses 10 tickets to buy toys, then he will have 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left.   Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left after buying toys with 10 of his tickets.
Response:  First, we know that Hayley raised 14 trees in her garden. Second, we know that after the typhoon, 9 of them died. So, how many trees are left? To find out, we can subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees: 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 trees left alive in Hayley's garden.
Response:  First, we know that 13 trees were planted in Haley's garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 6 of them died, leaving us with how many surviving trees? To find out, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees originally planted: 13 - 6 = 7 So there are 7 trees left alive after the typhoon.
Response:  First, we know that there were originally 20 trees in Haley's garden. Secondly, after the typhoon, only four trees remained standing. Finally, we want to find out how many trees died due to the typhoon. To do this, we need to subtract the number of surviving trees (four) from the original number of trees (twenty): Twenty - Four = Sixteen. Therefore, sixteen trees died due to the typhoon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Hayley had 5 trees that died after the typhoon, so she has 5 - 5 = 0 trees left. Next, we know that she has 12 trees remaining, so she has 12 + 0 = 12 trees in total. Therefore, Hayley grew a total of 12 trees.
Response:  First, Hayley had 9 trees in her garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 4 of them died, so she was left with 9 - 4 = 5 trees. Then, she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in her garden. Therefore, Hayley currently has 10 trees in her garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 12 trees were planted initially, and 2 trees died due to the typhoon. Therefore, the number of remaining trees is:  12 - 2 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 13 trees in the garden.  Of those, 3 trees were cared for and survived the typhoon.  This means that 10 trees did not receive proper care and may have died during the storm.   Therefore, the number of trees that died due to the typhoon is 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 11 trees in the backyard of Haley's house.  Secondly, we are told that two trees died after the typhoon. Therefore, the number of surviving trees can be calculated as follows:  11 - 2 = 9  So, there are 9 trees left in the backyard after the typhoon.
Response:  First, we know that there are 66 bags of oranges collected in one day. Next, we know that each bag contains 28 oranges. Therefore, to find out how many oranges were collected in one day, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of oranges in each bag:  66 bags x 28 oranges/bag =??? oranges/day So, the answer is: 66 bags x 28 oranges/bag = 1848 oranges/day
Response:  If he can collect 8 bags per day, then in one week (7 days), he can collect 7 x 8 = 56 bags. Therefore, to collect 24 bags, it will take him approximately  56 / 8 = 7 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 days of harvesting oranges and each day has a different number of bags collected. So, let's start with the first day.   On the first day, he collected 32 bags of oranges. We can assume that this is the maximum amount he could collect in one day since it's the starting point for all subsequent days. Now, let's move to the second day. Since the total collection for 4 days is 56 bags, and the second day's collection is 2 times the first day's collection (i.e., 2 x 32 = 64), so on the second day, he must have collected 64 - 32 = 32 bags. Similarly, on the third day, he would have collected 2 times the previous day's collection, which is 2 x 32 = 64, so he collected 64 - 32 = 32 bags again. Finally, on the fourth day, he collected 2 times the previous day's collection, which is 2 x 64 = 128, but since the total collection for 4 days is limited to 56 bags, so he only collected 128 - 56 = 72 bags. Therefore, the daily average collection of oranges was: (32 + 32 + 32 + 72) / 4 = 32 + 32 + 32 + 72 / 4 = 136 / 4 = 34 bags per day.
Response:  First, we know that there are 38 bags of oranges collected per day, and each bag contains 42 oranges. So, in total, they collect  38 x 42 = 1664 oranges per day. Since they have been collecting for 49 days, they will have collected  1664 x 49 = 79,504 oranges in total. Therefore, after 49 days of collection, they will have approximately 79,504 oranges.
Response:  First, we know that he harvested 66 bags of oranges per day, and each bag contains 25 oranges. So, in one day, he harvested 66 x 25 = 1650 oranges. Since the harvest lasted for 87 days, he harvested a total of 1650 x 87 = 143,950 oranges.
Response:  First, we know that there are 8 bags of oranges per day, and each bag contains 35 oranges. So, to calculate how many oranges are collected in one day, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of oranges in each bag.   Therefore, the total number of oranges collected in one day is:  8 bags x 35 oranges/bag = 280 oranges/day
Response:  First, we know that each bag contains 57 oranges. Therefore, to collect 80 bags of oranges, we need to collect 80 x 57 = 4560 oranges in total. Since each day, he can collect 16 bags of oranges, we need:  4560 / 16 = 284 days to collect all the oranges.  So the answer is 284 days.
Response:  First, we know that one bag contains 12 oranges. So if we want to collect 35 bags of oranges, we need to collect 35 x 12 = 420 oranges in total.   Therefore, the answer is 420 oranges.
Response:  First, we know that he picked 74 oranges in one day and discarded 71 of them. So, he has 3 oranges left from that day.   Next, we need to calculate how many oranges he has after 51 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of oranges he had each day by the number of days he picked oranges. In other words, if he had x oranges on the first day, then he would have x x 51 = 51x oranges after 51 days.  Now, let's substitute the values we know:  On the first day, he had 3 oranges, so he would have 3 x 51 = 153 oranges after 51 days.  Therefore, after 51 days, he would have 153 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that he collected 76 bags of oranges in one day and discarded 64 bags. This means he kept 12 bags (76 - 64 = 12). Next, we are told that each bag contains 50 oranges, so he kept 12 x 50 = 600 oranges. Therefore, he collected 600 oranges in one day.
Response:  First, we know that in one day, he can collect 28 mature oranges and 52 immature oranges, so in total, he can collect 80 oranges per day.   Since there are 26 days of harvesting, we multiply 80 by 26 to get:  80 x 26 = 2080 oranges  Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, he will have collected 2080 oranges.
Response:  First, we know that in one day, they can harvest 82 bags of ripe oranges and 61 bags of unripe oranges. This means that in total, they can harvest 82 + 61 = 143 bags of oranges per day. Now, let's consider how many bags of oranges they will have after 25 days. We know that there are 30 days in April, so if they harvest for 25 days, they will have harvested for 25/30 of the month (since there are 30 days in April). Therefore, the number of bags of oranges they will have after 25 days is:  143 x (25/30) = 143 x 8 = 1144 bags of oranges After 25 days, they will have 1144 bags of oranges.
Response:  First, we know that in one day, they harvest 31 bags of ripe oranges and 24 bags of unripe oranges. This means that in total, they harvest 55 bags of oranges per day.   Now, let's consider how many days it takes for all the unripe oranges to ripen. We are given that there are 45 days until the end of the season. So, if we divide 45 by 55 (the number of bags harvested per day), we get approximately 0.82 days (or about 2 days) until all the unripe oranges ripen.  Therefore, after 45 days, there will be approximately 2 x 24 = 48 bags of unripe oranges that have ripened into ripe oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 bags of mature oranges and 25 bags of immature oranges in total. Secondly, we know that one day's harvest is 44 bags of mature oranges plus 25 bags of immature oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested per day is:  44 + 25 = 69 bags. So, the difference between the number of mature oranges and the number of immature oranges harvested per day is:  44 - 25 = 20 bags.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of bags of mature oranges is 5, and the number of oranges in each bag is not specified. Secondly, we know that the number of bags of immature oranges is 74, and the number of oranges in each bag is also not specified. Finally, we are asked to find out how many more bags of immature oranges were harvested than bags of mature oranges. To do this, we need to compare the total number of oranges in both cases. Since there are no specific numbers given for the number of oranges in each bag, let's assume that each bag contains x oranges. Then, we can write the following equations based on the information provided:

For mature oranges:
5x = 5(x) = 5x

For immature oranges:
74x = 74(x) = 74x

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x and y. Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get:

74x = 5x + 74x

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

69x = 79x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, there are 9 oranges in each bag of mature oranges and 9 \* 74 = 666 oranges in all the bags of immature oranges. Now, we can calculate the difference between the number of bags of immature oranges and mature oranges as follows:

Number of bags of immature oranges - Number of bags of mature oranges = 74 - 5 = 69

Therefore, there are 69 more bags of immature oranges than bags of mature oranges."
Response:  Firstly, we know that they harvested 54 bags of oranges in total. Secondly, we are given that each bag contains 18 oranges. Therefore, to calculate how many days it took to harvest all the oranges, we can use the following formula: Total number of oranges / Number of oranges per day = Number of days So, let's plug in the numbers: 54 bags x 18 oranges/bag =? days To solve for the number of days, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per day: 54 x 18 = 972 972 / 18 = 53 days Therefore, it took them 53 days to harvest all the oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that he harvested 56 bags of oranges in total. Secondly, we are given that he harvested for 14 days. So, to find out how many bags he harvested per day, let's divide the total number of bags by the number of days he harvested:  56 bags / 14 days =? bags/day Now, we have our answer! He harvested 4 bags of oranges per day.
"Response:  First, we know that in one day, he can collect 25 immature oranges and 5 mature oranges. So, if he collects oranges for 73 days, he will have:  
Day 1: 25 immature + 5 mature = 30 oranges Day 2: 25 immature + 5 mature = 30 oranges... Day 73: 25 immature + 5 mature = 30 oranges Total number of immature oranges collected over 73 days: 25 x 73 = 1825 oranges Total number of mature oranges collected over 73 days: 5 x 73 = 365 oranges Therefore, after 73 days of collecting oranges, he will have a total of 1825 + 365 = 2190 oranges with him."
Response:  First, we know that in one day, they harvested 65 immature oranges and 46 mature oranges, so in total, they harvested 65 + 46 = 111 oranges per day.   Next, we know that they have 6 days left to harvest, so we can multiply the number of oranges they harvested per day by 6 to find out how many oranges they will have after 6 days: 111 x 6 = 666 oranges.  Therefore, after 6 days, they will have 666 - 111 = 555 oranges that are not yet ripe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of unripe oranges picked per day is 41 baskets. Secondly, we know that the number of ripe oranges picked per day is 86 baskets. Finally, we want to find out how many more baskets of ripe oranges are collected than unripe ones. To do this, subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges:  86 - 41 = 45 baskets. Therefore, there are 45 more baskets of ripe oranges collected than unripe ones.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of bags of unripe oranges is greater than the number of bags of ripe oranges. This means that the difference between the two numbers must be at least 1 bag. Therefore, if x is the number of bags of unripe oranges and y is the number of bags of ripe oranges, we can write an equation based on this information: x > y + 1. Now let's look at the given information again. We are told that the number of bags of unripe oranges is 71, and the number of bags of ripe oranges is 60. Using our equation above, we can substitute these values in to get: x = 71 > y + 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us: x - 1 = 70 > y. Solving for y gives us: y = 49. So there are 49 bags of ripe oranges. Finally, we can find out how many more bags of unripe oranges there are by subtracting the number of bags of ripe oranges from the number of bags of unripe oranges: x - y = 71 - 49 = 22. Therefore, there are 22 more bags of unripe oranges than ripe oranges.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer the length is than the width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, we can ask ourselves:  12 - 11 =?  That gives us our answer! The length of Jessie's room is 1 foot longer than the width.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs 14 square feet of carpet for her room, and we also know that the length of her room is 7 feet. To find out how wide her room is, we can use the formula area = length x width. Since we are looking for the width, let's solve for it.   width = area / length  width = 14 sq ft / 7 ft  width = 2 ft (rounded to the nearest foot)  Therefore, Jessie's room is 2 feet wide.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie needs 14 square feet of carpet. Since the width of her room is given as 7 feet, we can find out how many feet long her room needs to be if we divide the total area she needs by the width of her room.  14 square feet / 7 feet (width) = x feet (length)  Simplifying this equation gives us: 14 / 7 = x  Multiplying both sides by 7 gives us: 14 \* 7 = 7 x  Now solve for x: 98 = 7x  Dividing both sides by 7 gives us: x = 14  So, Jessie's room needs to be 14 feet long.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much of the room is left after the existing carpet has been placed.  To do this, we can subtract the area of the existing carpet from the total area of the room.  The area of the existing carpet is 16 square feet (length x width).  So, if we subtract that from the total area of the room, we get: Total Area - Carpet Area = Room Left Over 11 x 15 = 165 - 16 = 149 square feet  Now we know how much space is left in the room before placing any additional carpet.  To determine how much more carpet is needed, we simply need to divide the remaining space by the size of the new carpet.  For example, let's say we want to add another 20 square feet of carpet.  We would divide the remaining space (149) by the size of the new carpet (20):  149 / 20 = 7  This tells us that we need an additional 7 pieces of carpet, each with a size of 20 square feet.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the area of Jessie's room in square feet.  The length is 2 feet, and the width is 12 feet, so the area is: Area = Length x Width = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet Next, we know that each tile has an area of 4 square feet, so we can divide the total area of the room by the size of one tile to find out how many tiles are needed: Number of tiles = Total area / Size of one tile = 24 / 4 = 6 tiles Therefore, six tiles will be needed to cover the entire floor of Jessie's room.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total area of all 20 rooms combined.  Since each room has a length of 19 feet and a width of 18 feet, we can calculate the area as follows: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 352 square feet (approximately) Next, we need to find out how much carpet is needed for one room. Let's assume that the carpet comes in rolls with a width of 6 feet (a common size). To cover one room completely, we will need: Number of Rolls = Total Room Area / Roll Size = 352 / 6 = approximately 58.7 rolls Now, since there are 20 rooms in total, we will need: Total Carpet Needed = Number of Rolls x Number of Rooms = 58.7 x 20 = approximately 1174.4 square meters (or about 12,750 square feet) So, to cover all 20 rooms with carpet, you would need around 1174.4 square meters or 12,750 square feet of carpet.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie's room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long. To find out how much longer the length of the room is compared to the width, we can subtract the width from the length:  20 - 19 = 1 foot. So, the length of the room is one foot longer than the width.
"Response:  We know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet for her room, and we also know that the length of her room is 5 feet. To find out how wide the room needs to be in order to cover it with 10 square feet of carpet, we can use the formula for area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since we are given that the length of the room is 5 feet, we need to find out what width would give us an area of 10 square feet.  
Width = Area / Length Width = 10 / 5 Width = 2 So, the width of Jessie's room needs to be 2 feet in order to cover it with 10 square feet of carpet."
Response:  First, we know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet for her room. Since the width of her room is given as 2 feet, we can find out how long the room needs to be if we divide the total area needed (10 square feet) by the width (2 feet).  10 square feet / 2 feet = 5 feet So, Jessie's room needs to be at least 5 feet long.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the area of Jessie's room. We know that the length is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, so the area can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet Now, we need to subtract the area of the bed from the total area of the room to find out how much carpet Jessie needs. We are told that the bed takes up 6 square feet, so we can subtract that from the total area like this: Total Area - Bed Area = 80 - 6 = 74 square feet Therefore, Jessie needs 74 square feet of carpet to cover her entire room, including the bed.
"Response:  First, we know that each T-shirt sold brings in $23 profit.  Second, we are given that they sold a total of $230 worth of T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas A&M game.  So, if we want to find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:  23 x (number of shirts) = 230  Now solve for ""number of shirts"" :  number of shirts = 230 / 23  number of shirts = 10 Therefore, they sold 10 T-shirts during the game."
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling 3 T-shirts is $51.  Since each T-shirt has the same price, we can calculate the price of one T-shirt as follows:   Price of one T-shirt = Total revenue / Number of T-shirts sold Price of one T-shirt = $51 / 3 Price of one T-shirt = $17 So, the price of one T-shirt is $17.
Response:  First, we know that each T-shirt costs $87 and there are 95 in total. So, the total revenue from selling all 95 T-shirts is:  95 x $87 = $8,235 Next, we know that 47 of those T-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game, so we need to subtract the cost of those T-shirts from the total revenue to find out how much money was made from just the Arkansas game:  47 x $87 = $3,969 Subtracting this amount from the total revenue gives us the profit from the Arkansas game:   $8,235 - $3,969 = $4,266 Therefore, the profit from the Arkansas game is $4,266.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of T-shirts sold is 242. Second, we know that the Arkansas game sold 115 T-shirts. Therefore, the remaining T-shirts sold at the Texas Tech game are:  242 - 115 = 127.  So, the Texa
Response:  First, we know that the total number of T-shirts sold is 163. Second, we know that 89 T-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. So, to find out how much was earned from the Arkansas game, we can multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per T-shirt:  89 x $98 = $8,722. Therefore, the earnings from the Arkansas game are $8,722.
"Response:  First, we know that the revenue from selling T-shirts at an Arkansas game is $172 x $78 = $13,576. Next, we need to find out how much revenue they made from selling T-shirts at the Texas Tech game. We can do this by subtracting the revenue from the Arkansas game from the total revenue of $186 x $78 = $14,392. So, the revenue from the Texas Tech game is:  
$14,392 - $13,576 = $816."
"Response:  First, we know that the profit from selling one T-shirt is $62. Second, we know that they sold 183 T-shirts in total. So, if we multiply 183 by $62, we get:  
Profit from T-shirts = 183 x $62 = $11,466  Next, we know that the profit from selling one pair of jeans is $99. Third, we know that they sold 31 pairs of jeans in total. So, if we multiply 31 by $99, we get:  
Profit from jeans = 31 x $99 = $3,099  Finally, to find out the total profit, we add up the profits from both T-shirts and jeans:  
Total Profit = Profit from T-shirts + Profit from jeans = $11,466 + $3,099 = $14,565"
Response:  First, we know that the profit from selling T-shirts is $67 per shirt, so if they sold 74 T-shirts, their total profit from T-shirts would be:   Profit from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt  = 74 x $67  = $4,938 Now, let's calculate the profit from selling Jerseys. We know that the profit from each Jersey is $165, and they sold 156 Jerseys in total. So, their total profit from Jerseys would be:   Profit from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey  = 156 x $165  = $25,540 Therefore, the total profit from both T-shirts and Jerseys would be:   Total Profit = Profit from T-shirts + Profit from Jerseys  = $4,938 + $25,540  = $30,478
Response:  First, we know that T-shirts were sold for $192 per unit and jerseys were sold for $34 per unit.  Next, we know that they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas A&M game.  Finally, we want to find out which item had a higher profit margin.   To do this, we need to calculate the total revenue from both items first.  Revenue from T-shirts = 157 x $192 = $29,644  Revenue from Jerseys = 19 x $34 = $628  Now, let's calculate the total profit for each item:  Profit from T-shirts = Revenue - Cost  = $29,644 - ($192 x 157) = $29,644 - $29,044 = $600  Profit from Jerseys = Revenue - Cost  = $628 - ($34 x 19) = $628 - $624 = $4  Based on these calculations, it appears that T-shirts had a higher profit margin than jerseys.  The difference in profit between the two items is $600 - $4 = $596.
"Response:  First, we know that T-shirts were sold for $86 each and jerseys were sold for $232 each. Next, we are given that they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas A&M game. To find out how much revenue was generated from each type of shirt, let's multiply the number of items sold by their respective prices:  
Revenue from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt  Revenue from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey  
Now, let's plug in the numbers:  
Revenue from T-shirts = 254 x $86 = $21,744  
Revenue from Jerseys = 43 x $232 = $9,764  
So, the total revenue generated from both types of shirts is: Total Revenue = Revenue from T-shirts + Revenue from Jerseys = $21,744 + $9,764 = $31,508 Now, to determine which item generates more profit, we need to compare the revenue generated from each item with its cost price. The cost price of T-shirts is not provided, so we can't calculate the profit margin for T-shirts. However, we do know that the cost price of Jerseys is higher than that of T-shirts ($232 > $86). Therefore, it is likely that Jerseys generate more profit than T-shirts."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money was made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas A&M game. We know that each T-shirt cost $51 and there were 130 shirts sold in total. So, the total amount of money earned from T-shirt sales is:  51 x 130 = 6,430 dollars.  Next, we need to subtract the discount given for each T-shirt. We know that each T-shirt had an 8 dollar discount, so we can subtract this amount from the total earnings:  6,430 - 8 x 130 = 6,430 - 1,040 = 5,390 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas A&M game was $5,390.
Response:  First, we know that each T-shirt was sold for $217, which is an increase of $16 ($217 - $201) over the original price. Since they sold 14 shirts in total, we can calculate the total amount earned as follows:   Total Amount Earned = Number of Shirts x Increase per Shirt Total Amount Earned = 14 x $16 Total Amount Earned = $224 So, they earned $224 from selling the T-shirts.
Response:  First, we know that the total revenue from selling T-shirts is $60. Second, we know that each T-shirt costs $10. Therefore, to find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can divide the total revenue by the cost of one T-shirt: 60 / 10 = 6 So, they sold 6 T-shirts.
"Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling 5 T-shirts is $215.  If we divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold (5), we get the price of one T-shirt:  
$215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt."
Response:  First, we know that T-shirts were sold for $215 each and Jerseys were sold for $5 each.  Next, we know that they sold 20 T-shirts and 64 Jerseys in total.  So, let's calculate the revenue from T-shirt sales first:  20 x $215 = $4,300 (revenue from T-shirt sales) Now, let's calculate the revenue from Jersey sales:  64 x $5 = $3,200 (revenue from Jersey sales) Finally, let's add up the total revenue:  $4,300 + $3,200 = $7,500 Total revenue from both T-shirts and Jerseys is $7,500.
Response:  First, we know that the profit from selling T-shirts is $204 per shirt. Since they sold 158 T-shirts, their total profit from T-shirts is:   Profit from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt  = 158 x $204  = $31,992  Next, we know that the profit from selling jerseys is $76 per jersey. Since they sold 2 jerseys, their total profit from jerseys is:   Profit from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey  = 2 x $76  = $152  Therefore, the total profit for the event is the sum of the profits from T-shirts and jerseys:   Total Profit = Profit from T-shirts + Profit from Jerseys  = $31,992 + $152  = $32,144
Response:  First, we know that T-shirts are more expensive than jerseys. So if we sell 177 T-shirts and 23 jerseys, the total revenue from T-shirts will be higher than the total revenue from jerseys.   Next, we know that each T-shirt costs $240, and each jersey costs $210. So the total revenue from T-shirts is:  177 x $240 = $41,680  The total revenue from jerseys is:   23 x $210 = $4,930  Therefore, the difference between the total revenue from T-shirts and the total revenue from jerseys is:   $41,680 - $4,930 = $36,750  This means that the profit from selling T-shirts is $36,750 higher than the profit from selling jerseys.
"Response:  First, we know that the profit from selling T-shirts is $25 per shirt, and they sold 113 of them, so the total profit from T-shirts is:   Profit from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt  = 113 x $25  = $2,825  Next, we know that the profit from selling jerseys is $115 per jersey, and they sold 78 jerseys, so the total profit from jerseys is:   Profit from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey  = 78 x $115  = $9,030  Therefore, the total profit for both items is:   Total Profit = Profit from T-shirts + Profit from Jerseys  = $2,825 + $9,030  = $11,855  So, the answer to the question ""Is the jersey more expensive than the T-shirt?"" is:  Yes, the jersey is more expensive than the T-shirt. The jersey costs $115, while the T-shirt costs $25."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each set of tables has 10 chairs. Since there are 5 sets of tables, in total, there will be 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. However, this is not enough to accommodate all the guests since they have decided to hold the party in their backyard. Therefore, we need to add more chairs. For every table, we can add an additional 2 chairs (since there are already 10 chairs per table), which gives us 2 x 5 = 10 more chairs. In total, then, there will be 50 + 10 = 60 chairs for all the guests.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two tables with the same number of chairs. Secondly, we know that there are 12 chairs in total in the backyard. Finally, we can deduce that each table has 6 chairs since 12 is divisible by 2 and 6. So the answer is 6 chairs per table.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 chairs in the backyard. Secondly, each table set has 3 chairs. Therefore, to accommodate all 9 guests, they will need at least 3 table sets. So, the number of table sets they will have is:  3 x 9 = 27 
So, the answer is 27."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs. So, in total, there are 11 x 13 = 143 chairs. However, this number does not include any extra chairs or seats that may be available for guests. Therefore, to determine how many chairs the hosts have, we need to subtract the number of chairs required for each table from the total number of chairs. Since each table requires 13 chairs, we can calculate the number of chairs needed as follows:  143 - (11 x 13) = 143 - 143 = 0. This means that the hosts have 0 chairs left after setting up all the tables with their respective chairs. In other words, they do not have any extra chairs for their guests.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each. Therefore, in total, there are 10 x 6 = 60 chairs. Now, if there are 11 people sitting down, then one person will have to sit on an extra chair. So, the number of unused chairs is 60 - 11 = 49.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each set of tables has 14 chairs. So, if they have 12 sets of tables, then they have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs in total. Additionally, they have 6 extra chairs, so the total number of guest chairs is 168 + 6 = 174.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there will be 14 people attending the party and each set of tables has 3 chairs. So, to calculate how many sets of tables are needed, we can divide the number of attendees by the number of chairs per set:  14 / 3 = 4  Therefore, they need 4 sets of tables.  Now, let's calculate how many chairs in total they need:  4 x 3 = 12  They need 12 chairs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 tablesets and each table has 14 chairs. So, in total, there are 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. However, since each chair is counted twice (once for each table it belongs to), we need to divide the number of chairs by 2 to get the correct count. Therefore, the number of chairs is 126 / 2 = 63.
Response:  We know that Louis earns $460 in total over 5 weeks. That means he earns $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks). So, one week's income for Louis is $92.
Response:  If Louis earned $16 per week and worked for 12 weeks, he would have earned a total of:  16 x 12 = 192 dollars  Since Louis earned $1216, we know that he did not work for 12 weeks. Instead, he worked for:  1216 / 192 = 6 weeks  Therefore, Louis worked for 6 weeks to earn $1216.
Response:  First, we know that Louis earns $21 per week during the harvest season of 216 weeks. This means he earns:  21 x 216 = $4592 per year. Next, we know that Louis does not have to pay taxes if he has less than $702 left after the harvest season. So, we need to calculate how much money Louis will have left after the harvest season. We can do this by subtracting his expenses from his income:  4592 - 702 = $3890. Therefore, Louis will have $3890 left after the harvest season.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Louis earns per year:  1357 x 4 = 5428 (per year) Now, let's calculate how much he earns in 73 seasons:  5428 x 73 = 390,644 (in 73 seasons)
Response:  First, we know that Louis works for 1091 weeks during the harvest season and earns $28 per week. This means he earns:  28 x 1091 = $31,568 per year During the peak season, Louis also works overtime and earns an additional $939 per week. This means he earns:  939 x 4 weeks = $3,716 per month During the peak season, Louis works for 4 months (12 weeks x 3 days/week). Therefore, his total income from overtime work during the peak season is:  3,716 x 4 months = $14,864 per year Total income for the year = $31,568 + $14,864 = $46,432
Response:  First, we know that Louis earns $403 per week during the harvest period of 233 weeks. This means he earns a total of:   Total income = Number of weeks x Weekly income   = 233 x $403   = $91,590 To find out how much Louis can save if he doesn't have to pay rent, let's subtract his weekly expenses from his total income:   Savings = Total income - Expenses   = $91,590 - $49 x 233   = $91,590 - $11,677   = $80,913 So, Louis can save approximately $80,913 if he doesn't have to pay rent during the harvest period.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Louis will earn during the harvest period in total:   Total Earnings = Number of weeks x Weekly Income  Total Earnings = 1359 weeks x $368 per week  Total Earnings = $497,220 Now, let's subtract the amount he needs to pay for rent each week from his total earnings:  Total Earnings - Rent Payments = $497,220 - ($388 x 1359)  Total Earnings - Rent Payments = $497,220 - $523,322  Total Earnings - Rent Payments = -$26,102 Since the result is negative, it means that Louis will not have enough money to pay for his rent during the harvest period. Therefore, the answer is ""he cannot afford to pay for his rent."""
Response:  First, we know that Louis earns $491 per week during the harvest season, which lasts for 1181 weeks (or approximately 23 years). So, his total earnings over the entire period are:  491 x 1181 = $570,911   Next, we know that he has to pay $216 per week in rent, so his net income is:  570,911 - 216 x 1181 = $570,911 - $246,416 = $324,495   Finally, since he doesn't have any other expenses or savings, his remaining balance at the end of the harvest season is simply his net income:  324,495.
Response:  First, we know that Louis has earned $133 in total over 19 weeks. So, if we divide $133 by 19, we get the average amount he earns per week:   $133 / 19 = $6.95 per week Now, we can calculate how much Louis earns per day by dividing his weekly earnings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):   $6.95 per week / 7 = $0.99 per day Therefore, Louis earns $0.99 per day.
"Response:  If Louis earns $2 per week and works for 178 weeks, he will have earned a total of:  
$2 x 178 = $356  
So, the harvest lasted for 178 weeks or approximately 3 years and 9 months."
Response:  First, we know that Dean is 9 feet tall, so if the water is 10 times his height, it would be:  10 x 9 = 90 feet deep.  Therefore, the water is 90 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron is 14 feet tall, then Dean is 6 feet tall (14 - 8 = 6). Now, we are told that the water is twice as deep as Dean's height, so the depth of the water would be 2 x 6 = 12 feet.   Therefore, the water is 12 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron is 12 feet tall, Dean is 12 - 11 = 1 foot tall. Now, we are told that the water is 5 times as deep as Ron's height, so the depth of the water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet. Therefore, the water is 60 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so if Ron is 13 feet tall, then Dean is 13 + 4 = 17 feet tall. Now, we are told that the water is 15 times the height of Dean, so the depth of the water would be 17 x 15 = 255 feet deep.
"Response:  First, we know that Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, so Dean's height is:  
Dean = Ron + 9 feet 
Ron = 13 feet 
Therefore, Dean's height is: 
Dean = 13 + 9 = 22 feet  Now, we know that the water is 16 times Ron's height deep, so the depth of the water is:  
Water depth = 16 x Ron's height 
Substituting Ron's height: 
Water depth = 16 x 13 = 208 feet  Therefore, if Ron stands at 13 feet tall and Dean stands at 22 feet tall, the depth of the water would be approximately 208 feet."
Response:  First, we know that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron is 15 feet tall, then Dean is 9 feet tall (15 - 6 = 9). Now, we are told that the water is 9 times Dean's height deep, so the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet deep.   Therefore, the correct answer is 81 feet.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally between two bookshelves, then each bookshelf will have half of the total number of books, which is 34/2 = 17 books.  Therefore, there will be 17 books on each bookshelf.
Response:  Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf can hold 2 books. So, he needs 42/2 = 21 bookshelves.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 23 bookshelves, and each shelf contains 27 books. So, the total number of books is:  23 x 27 = 611 books. Next, we know that Brian also has 80 magazines. Therefore, the total number of items (books + magazines) is:  611 + 80 = 691 items.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 10 shelves of books and each shelf contains 9 books. So, he has a total of 10 x 9 = 90 books. Now, let's find out how many magazines he has. We are given that he has 46 magazines. Since each shelf can hold only books, Brian cannot place any magazines on his bookshelves. Therefore, he must have 46 magazines in addition to his 90 books. In total, Brian owns 90 + 46 = 136 items (books and magazines).
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 29 bookshelves, and each shelf contains 23 books and 61 magazines. So, let's start with the number of books:  29 x 23 = 647 books Total number of books: 647 Now, let's calculate the total number of magazines:  29 x 61 = 1891 magazines Total number of magazines: 1891 Therefore, Brian has a total of 647 books and 1891 magazines.
Response:  Brian has 28 books in total and each bookshelf has the same number of books. So, if we divide 28 by the number of bookshelves (let's call it x), we can find out how many books are on each shelf.  28 / x =?  We know that x is equal to 7 because there are 7 bookshelves. Now we can solve for x:  28 / 7 =?  Simplifying:  4 =?  There you have it! Each bookshelf has 4 books.
Response:  Brian has 38 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books. So, he has 38 / 2 = 19 bookshelves.
Response:  Carol has 10 friends and she wants to send each of them an invitation card for her birthday party. Since there are two invitation cards in each package, we can calculate how many packages Carol needs as follows:  10 (friends) x 2 (invitations per package) = 20 invitations needed Total number of packages required = 20 / 2 (invitations per package) = 10 packages Carol needs 10 packages to distribute among her 10 friends.
Response:  Carol has 12 friends and she bought 3 packs of invitations. If each pack contains the same number of invitations, we can let x be that number. Since Carol has 12 friends, she needs to send an invitation to each friend. So, the total number of invitations Carol needs is 12. Now, we know that 3 packs contain a total of 12 invitations, so we can set up the equation:  3x = 12  Solving for x, we get:  x = 4  Therefore, each pack of invitations contains 4 invitations.
Response:  Carol has bought 7 packs of invitation cards, and each pack contains 10 cards. So, she has bought a total of 7 x 10 = 70 cards. Since she wants to send only 2 invitations to her friends, she will not use all the cards she has bought. The number of cards left unused is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  Firstly, Carol has bought 6 packs of invitation cards, each containing 14 cards. So she has bought a total of 6 x 14 = 84 cards. Additionally, she has bought 11 extra cards. Therefore, in total, Carol has bought 84 + 11 = 95 cards. Now, let's calculate how many friends she can invite using these cards. Since each card can invite one friend, Carol can invite 95 / 1 = 95 friends.
Response:  Firstly, Carol has bought two packs of invitation cards, and each pack contains three invitation cards. So, in total, she has bought 2 x 3 = 6 invitation cards. Now, she wants to invite 9 friends, so she needs 9 - 6 = 3 more invitation cards. Therefore, she needs to buy 3 additional invitation cards.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 12 points in each match, so if she played x matches, she would have scored 12x points in total. Since she scored 36 points in total, we can set up the equation:  12x = 36. Solving for x, we get:  x = 3. So Melissa played 3 matches.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 81 points in total and each game she played gave her the same number of points. So, if we divide 81 by 3, we get the average number of points she scored per game:  81 / 3 = 27  Therefore, Melissa scored 27 points in each game.
"Response:  First, we know that Melissa scored 109 points in each match, so she scored a total of:  
109 x 79 = 8,601 points  Next, we know that she received 82 bonus points in each match, so she received a total of:  
82 x 79 = 6,538 bonus points Therefore, Melissa's total score is:  
8,601 (points from matches) + 6,538 (bonus points) = 15,149 points"
Response:  First, we know that Melissa scored a total of 21 points in all games. Second, we know that she scored 7 points in each game. So, if we divide 21 by 7, we get:  21 / 7 = 3 Games Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 games, so we can calculate her average score per game as follows:  91 / 13 = 7 (average score per game) Now, since each game was worth the same number of points, we can assume that Melissa scored 7 points in each game.  Therefore, the answer is 7 points per game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four seats in each car of the Paradise Park ride. Secondly, we know that 20 people can ride at once. So, if one seat can accommodate x number of people, then 20 people can be seated as follows:  20 = 4x Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:  x = 5 Therefore, one seat can accommodate 5 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each seat can accommodate 9 people. Therefore, if there are x seats in total, then x \* 9 = 18 (since 18 people will be riding the Ferris wheel). Now, let's solve for x. x = 2 (since 2 \* 9 = 18). So, there are 2 seats in the Ferris wheel.
Response:  First, we know that each Ferris wheel has 19 seats, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, in total, each Ferris wheel can carry 19 x 15 = 285 people. Since there are 20 Ferris wheels, the total number of people who can ride them at the same time is 285 x 20 = 5700 people.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, if all seats were functional, the maximum number of people who could ride the Ferris wheel at once would be 18 x 15 = 270. Now, let's consider the case where 10 seats are broken. If 10 seats are out of order, then we have 18 - 10 = 8 functional seats remaining. Each functional seat can still accommodate 15 people, so the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel with 10 seats broken is 8 x 15 = 120. Therefore, the answer to the question ""If 10 seats of the Ferris wheel in Paradise Park are broken, how many people can ride it simultaneously?"" is 120."
Response:  First, we know that each seat can accommodate 14 people. So if there are 6 seats in total, then the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. However, we are told that currently 16 people are riding the Ferris wheel. Therefore, the remaining space available for additional riders is 84 - 16 = 68 people.
Response:  First, we know that there are two small seats and 23 large seats in total.  Second, we know that each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so together they can hold 2 x 14 = 28 people. Thirdly, we know that each large seat can accommodate 54 people, so together they can hold 23 x 54 = 1224 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 28 + 1224 = 1252 people.
Response:  First, we know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total.  Second, we know that each small seat can accommodate 4 people, so 3 x 4 = 12 people can be seated in the small seats.  Third, we know that each large seat can accommodate 6 people, so 7 x 6 = 42 people can be seated in the large seats.  Fourth, we need to find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel altogether. Therefore, we add up the number of people who can sit in the small and large seats: 12 + 42 = 54 people.  So, a total of 54 people can ride the Ferris wheel at one time.
Response:  We know that there are 4 seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and we want to find out how many people can sit in one seat. Since we are told that 16 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, we can set up an equation as follows:  16 = 4 x (some number)  Now we need to solve for the unknown number. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:  4 = (some number) x 16  Now we can see that the some number is equal to 4. So, one seat can accommodate 4 people.
Response:  If each seat can accommodate two people, and there are four people who can ride at the same time, then we need to find out how many seats are required to accommodate all four people.  We know that two people can sit in each seat, so we can divide the total number of riders (four) by the number of people per seat (two):  4 / 2 = 2  This means that we need two seats to accommodate all four people. Therefore, the amusement park's Ferris wheel has two seats.
Response:  We know that there are 7 pizzas in total and each pizza has the same number of slices. So if we divide 7 into 14 (the total number of slices), we can find out how many slices each pizza has.  14 / 7 = 2 So each pizza has 2 slices.
Response:  We know that there are 2 slices of pizza in each slice, so we can start by finding out how many slices of pizza were ordered in total.  28 slices / 2 slices per slice = 14 slices of pizza were ordered.  Therefore, we ordered 14 slices of pizza.
Response:  We know that there are 17 pizzas in total and each pizza has 4 slices. So we can start by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza to get the total number of slices:  17 x 4 = 68 slices  Now we need to divide this number by the number of people eating the pizza to find out how many slices each person will get:  68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person  Since we cannot have a fraction of a slice, we round up to the nearest whole number:  2.72 rounds up to 3 slices per person  Therefore, if 25 people order 17 pizzas with 4 slices per pizza, each person will receive approximately 3 slices of pizza.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas in total and each pizza has 10 slices. So we have 9 x 10 = 90 slices of pizza in total. Since there are two people, we need to divide the 90 slices equally between them. Therefore, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices of pizza.
Response:  First, we know that each flower bed has 10 seeds. Second, we know that there are 45 flower beds in total. Therefore, to find out how many seeds were planted in total, we can multiply the number of flower beds by the number of seeds per flower bed:  45 x 10 = 450 seeds  So, Page and her mother planted 450 seeds in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 flowerbeds in total and each flowerbed needs the same number of seeds. Since Paige and her mother together planted 45 seeds in all the flowerbeds, we can say that each flowerbed has 45/9 = 5 seeds. Therefore, each flowerbed has 5 seeds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they planted 36 types of flowers in total. Secondly, each flowerbed had 12 types of seeds, so there were 36/12 = 3 flowerbeds in total. Finally, since each flowerbed had 58 types of flowers, we can conclude that they had 3 x 58 = 174 flowers in total.
Response:  First, we know that each flowerbed has 15 types of seeds, and there are 3 flowerbeds in total. So, the total number of seeds is:  15 x 3 = 45  Next, we know that each seed can grow into 60 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is:  45 x 60 = 2700  Therefore, the total number of flowers grown by Page and her mother is 2700.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each flowerbed can hold 10 seeds.  Secondly, we are given that they planted a total of 60 seeds.  Finally, we need to find out how many flowerbeds they had in total.  To do this, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per flowerbed:  60 / 10 = 6  Therefore, they had 6 flowerbeds in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each flowerbed has the same number of seeds, so all we need to do is find out how many seeds are in total and divide them equally among the eight flowerbeds. Total number of seeds = 32 (given) Number of flowerbeds = 8 So, the number of seeds per flowerbed = Total number of seeds / Number of flowerbeds = 32 / 8 = 4 Therefore, there are four seeds in each flowerbed.
"Response:  First, Matthew gave each of his 11 friends two crackers. So, he gave a total of 11 x 2 = 22 crackers away. Now, how many crackers does Matthew have left?  
Answer:  Matthew has 22 - 22 = 0 crackers left. He has no more crackers!"
Response:  If Matthew gave 8 crackers to his friends and gave each friend two crackers, then he would have given a total of  2 x 4 = 8 crackers away. Therefore, Matthew had 8 - 8 = 0 crackers left. So, Matthew did not give any crackers to himself. He gave crackers to 7 other people (since there are 7 friends in addition to himself).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew had 15 crackers in total and he divided them equally among his 5 friends. This means each friend received an equal share of the crackers. Since there were 5 friends, each friend received 15/5 = 3 crackers. So, each friend ate 3 crackers.  

Answer: 3"
"Response:  First, we know that Matthew gave each of his three friends an equal number of crackers. Since there are 24 crackers in total and 3 people, each person will receive 24/3 = 8 crackers. So, Matthew gave each friend 8 crackers.  
Now, let's check if our answer makes sense. We know that Matthew had 24 crackers to start with, and he gave each of his three friends 8 crackers, so how many crackers does he have left? Well, 24 - (3 x 8) = 24 - 24 = 0! Yes, Matthew has no crackers left, which means he distributed all 24 crackers equally among his three friends."
Response:  First, we know that Matthew has 22 crackers and 34 cookies in total. Next, we are told that he wants to divide them equally among 11 of his friends. So, let's start with the number of items each friend will receive.   To do this, we can use division. In particular, we can use long division to find out how many items each friend will get. Here is the calculation:  22 / 11 =? (This asks how many groups of 11 there are in 22.)  11 x 11 = 121 (This calculates the total number of items needed for 11 friends.)  22 - 121 = 0 (This shows that there are no remaining items after dividing 22 by 11.)  Now that we have found out how many items each friend will receive, we can calculate how many crackers and cookies each friend will get.  For example, if we want to know how many crackers one friend will get, we can multiply the number of crackers by the number of friends receiving them:  22 x 1 = 22 (This gives us the number of crackers one friend will receive.)  Similarly, if we want to know how many cookies one friend will get, we can multiply the number of cookies by the number of friends receiving them:  34 x 1 = 34 (This gives us the number of cookies one friend will receive.)  Therefore, each friend will receive 22 crackers and 34 cookies.  Finally, to determine how many crackers and cookies Matthew himself will have, we need to subtract the total number of items given to his friends from the original number of items he had:  22 - (11 x 22) = 22 - 242 = 0 (This shows that Matthew has no crackers or cookies left after giving them away to his friends.)  Conclusion: Each of Matthew's 11 friends will receive 22 crackers and 34 cookies.
"Response:  First, we know that Matthew gave each of his two friends an equal number of crackers and cakes. Since there are 29 crackers in total, let's divide them equally among the two friends. There are 14 crackers per person. Now, let's look at the cakes. There are 30 cakes in total, so again, we'll divide them equally among the two friends. Each friend will get 15 cakes. So, one friend will eat 15 cakes, and the other friend will eat 15 cakes as well.  

Answer: The two friends ate 15 cakes each."
Response:  First, we know that Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies in total. Next, we are told that he divided them equally among 7 of his friends. So, let's start with the number of items each friend received. We can do this by dividing the total number of items by the number of friends.   For the crackers: Total crackers = 14  Number of friends = 7  Therefore, each friend received: 14 / 7 = 2 crackers  For the cookies: Total cookies = 21  Number of friends = 7  Therefore, each friend received: 21 / 7 = 3 cookies  Now, let's add up all the items each friend received to find out how many of each item they got in total. Crackers: 2 x 7 = 14 cookies: 3 x 7 = 21  There you have it! Each friend received 14 crackers and 21 cookies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew distributed 36 crackers equally among his 18 friends. This means each friend received an equal number of crackers. Since there are 18 friends in total, let's divide 36 by 18 to find out how many crackers each friend got:  36 / 18 = 2 So, each friend got 2 crackers. Therefore, Matthew had 2 crackers as well since he distributed them equally.
Response:  If Matthew gave one friend six crackers, then he has 36 - 6 = 30 crackers left.   Since each friend received 6 crackers, if Matthew had 30 crackers left and wanted to give them all away, he could have given them to 30/6 = 5 friends.  Therefore, Matthew would have given crackers to 5 friends.
"Response:  First, Matthew gave each of his two friends an equal number of crackers. Since there are 23 crackers in total and he gave each friend half (i.e., 23/2 = 11), each friend received 11 crackers. So, each friend ate 11 crackers.  

Question: What if we change the problem slightly? Instead of giving each friend the same number of crackers, what if Matthew gives one friend more crackers than the other? For example, suppose he gives Friend A 15 crackers and Friend B only 5 crackers. How many crackers will be left over after they finish eating?  Answer:  If Matthew gives Friend A 15 crackers and Friend B only 5 crackers, then the total number of crackers given out is 15 + 5 = 20. After they finish eating, there will be 23 - 20 = 3 crackers left over."
Response:  First, we know that Matthew had 31 crackers in total and he divided them equally among his 5 friends. This means each friend received  31/5 = 6.2 (approximately) crackers from Matthew. Since there were 23 crackers left over after dividing them equally, we can calculate how many crackers Matthew gave to each of his friends as follows:  6.2 x 5 = 31 (since there are 5 friends)  Therefore, Matthew gave 31 - 23 = 8 crackers to his friends.
Response:  First, Matthew divided the crackers and cakes equally among his four friends. This means that each friend received an equal number of crackers and cakes. Since there were initially 32 crackers and 98 cakes, we can start by finding out how many groups of equal numbers we can make with these quantities.   We know that 32 / 4 = 8 (since 32 divided by 4 is 8). So, Matthew gave 8 groups of crackers to his friends. Similarly, since 98 / 4 = 24 (since 98 divided by 4 is 24), Matthew gave 24 groups of cakes to his friends. Now, let's find out how many crackers and cakes each friend received.  For each group of crackers, there are 4 crackers (since 8 x 4 = 32). Therefore, each friend received 4 x 8 = 32 crackers. Similarly, for each group of cakes, there are 4 cakes (since 24 x 4 = 96). Therefore, each friend received 4 x 24 = 96 cakes. In summary, each friend received 32 crackers and 96 cakes.
Response:  First, Matthew gave out 10 crackers and 8 cakes to his 4 friends. Since there are 4 people, each person will receive  10/4 = 2.5 crackers and 8/4 = 2 cakes. However, we cannot have a fraction of a cake or cracker, so each person will receive 2 complete crackers and 2 complete cakes. Therefore, each person ate 2 crackers and 2 cakes.
Response:  First, Matthew gave out the same number of crackers and cakes to each of his 28 friends. So, if he had x crackers and y cakes initially, he would have given away x/28 crackers and y/28 cakes to each friend. Now, let's see how many crackers and cakes each friend got in total.   For the crackers: Each friend got x/28 crackers, so they got x/28 \* 28 = 28x/28 = x crackers in total.  Similarly, for the cakes: Each friend got y/28 cakes, so they got y/28 \* 28 = 28y/28 = y cakes in total.  Therefore, the total number of crackers and cakes that all 28 friends received is: Crackers: x + (28x) = 29x Cakes: y + (28y) = 29y  Since there were originally 13 crackers and 15 cakes, we can set up the following system of equations: 13 = 29x 15 = 29y Solving this system, we get: x = 4 y = 7 Thus, each friend got 4 crackers and 7 cakes in total.
Response:  First, we know that Debbie drank 109 bottles of water per day. Second, we know that each bottle lasted for 74 days. Therefore, to find out how many bottles Debbie bought, we can multiply the number of days she drank water (109) by the number of bottles she drank per day (1):  109 x 1 = 109 bottles.
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 bottles of water during the sale and she drank the same number of bottles every day for 17 days. So, we can start by finding out how many bottles Debbie drank in one day. To do this, we can divide the total number of bottles she bought (153) by the number of days she drank them (17): 153 ÷ 17 =?  Now we have our daily amount of bottles: 153 ÷ 17 = 9 So, Debbie drank 9 bottles of water every day.
Response:  First, we know that Debbie bought 264 bottles of water during the sale. Next, we know that she drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, so she drank a total of 11 x 15 = 165 bottles. Therefore, Debbie still has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles of water left.
"Response:  First, we know that Debbie bought 301 bottles of water during the sale. Next, we know that she drank 144 bottles per day for some number of days. Finally, we are told that there are 157 bottles left over after she finished drinking. To find out how many days Debbie drank water, let's set up an equation based on the information given:  301 = 144 x + 157 (where ""x"" represents the number of days) We can solve this equation by first subtracting 157 from both sides:  301 - 157 = 144x + 157 - 157 Subtracting 157 from both sides gives us:  144x = 144(x) + 157 - 157 Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  144x = 21,896 + 157 - 157 Solving for x, we get:  144x = 21,896 + 157 - 157 x = 144(21,896 / 144) x = 21,896 / 144 x = 157 days Therefore, Debbie drank water for 157 days."
Response:  First, we know that Debbie drank 4 bottles of water per day and 87 bottles of soda per day. So, she consumed a total of 4 + 87 = 91 bottles of drinks per day. Since there are 88 bottles of water in total, it will last for 91/88 = 1 day. Therefore, the answer is 1 day.
Response:  First, we know that Debbie drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day. We also know that she bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda. So let's start with the water.  200 bottles / 312 bottles per day = 0.64 days (or 1.4 days) That means Debbie has enough water for 1.4 days. Now let's look at the soda. 256 bottles / 4 bottles per day = 64 days (or 168 days) That means Debbie has enough soda for 168 days!
Response:  Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day, and she has bought 12 bottles in total. So, if we divide the number of bottles she has bought (12) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (6), we can find out how many days the 12 bottles will last her:  12 / 6 = 2 Therefore, the 12 bottles of water will last Debbie for 2 days.
Response:  First, we know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water. We also know that she drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day. To find out how many days she can hold off drinking water, we need to divide the number of water bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day:  180 / 15 = 12 So, Debbie can hold off drinking water for 12 days.
Response:  First, we know that Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. We also know that she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day. To find out how many days the soda will last, we need to divide the number of bottles of soda by the number of bottles she drinks per day:  360 / 9 = 40 So, the soda will last for 40 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 rows of lead pencils, and each row has 14 lead pencils. Therefore, the total number of lead pencils in all rows is:  11 x 14 = 154  So, Fei holds 154 lead pencils in total.
Response:  We know that Fei has 12 lead pencils and she wants to distribute them equally among 3 rows. So, we can start by dividing 12 by 3 to find out how many lead pencils each row will have:  12 / 3 = 4 Now we know that each row will have 4 lead pencils. Therefore, there are 4 x 3 = 12 lead pencils in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fei has 24 lead pencils in total and each row contains 16 lead pencils. So, if she wants to fill all the rows, she needs to use up all her lead pencils. Therefore, the number of rows she can make is equal to the number of lead pencils she has, which is 24.  
Now, let's calculate how many columns she can make with each row containing 16 lead pencils. We can do this by dividing the total number of lead pencils (24) by the number of lead pencils per row (16): 24 / 16 = 4. This means that Fei can make 4 complete rows of 16 lead pencils each."
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 22 lead pencils in total.  Next, we know that each pack of lead pencils contains 14 lead pencils. Therefore, to find out how many packs of lead pencils Fei has, we can divide 22 by 14:  22 / 14 = 1 remainder 8 So, Fei has 1 complete pack (14 lead pencils) plus 8 extra lead pencils. In total, she has 1 + 8 = 9 packs of lead pencils.
Response:  Firstly, Fei has 35 lead pencils and she wants to arrange them in rows. Since each row contains 5 lead pencils, we can calculate the number of rows as follows:  35 / 5 = 7 rows So, Fei can make 7 rows with her 35 lead pencils. Next, we know that Fei also has 7 colored pencils. She can use these colored pencils to color the drawings she creates using the lead pencils. Therefore, the total number of columns (or colors) available to Fei is 7.
Response:  First, we know that there are 4 pencils and 27 colored pens in total. Next, we know that each pencil is placed in one of 19 rows, so there must be 4 x 19 = 76 holes for the pencils. Finally, since each row can only hold one pen, there must be 27 / 19 = 1 remaining pen that does not fit into any row. Therefore, Fei has 4 pencils and 1 pen.
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 36 lead pencils and 30 colored pens in total. Next, we are told that she arranges them in one row with seven columns. This means each column contains six items (5 lead pencils and 1 colored pen). Therefore, Fei holds 6 x 7 = 42 colored pens.
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 31 lead pencils and each row contains 11 lead pencils, so she has 31 x 11 = 341 lead pencils in total.   Next, we know that Fei has 27 colored pencils and each row contains 11 colored pencils, so she has 27 x 11 = 297 colored pencils in total.   Therefore, Fei has a total of 341 + 297 = 638 writing utensils.
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 30 lead pencils and she wants to arrange them in rows of 5 each. So, if we divide 30 by 5, we get:  30 / 5 = 6  Therefore, Fei can make 6 rows of 5 lead pencils each.
Response:  Firstly, Fei has 6 pencils in total and she wants to distribute them equally between two columns. Therefore, each column will have half of the number of pencils, which is 6/2 = 3 pencils per column.
Response:  Firstly, Fei has 35 packs of lead pencils, and each pack contains 4 lead pencils. Therefore, in total, Fei has  35 x 4 = 140 lead pencils.  Secondly, Fei has arranged 2 lead pencils in one row. So, the number of rows that Fei can make is  140 / 2 = 70 rows.  Therefore, the answer is 70.
Response:  Firstly, Fei has 31 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. Therefore, she has a total of  31 x 6 = 186 pencils.  Secondly, Fei arranged 19 pencils in one row. Since there are 6 pencils in each pack, she can arrange 19/6 = 3 rows of pencils. Therefore, she has a total of  3 x 19 = 57 pencils arranged in rows.  Finally, we add up the number of pencils Fei has: 186 (from the packs) + 57 (from the rows) = 243 pencils.  So, Fei has 243 pencils in total.
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 71 colored pencils and 24 lead pencils in total. Next, we are told that she arranges them in rows of 30 each. So, let's calculate how many rows she has in total.   Row = Total / 30  We can substitute the values given in the problem to find out how many rows Fei has:  Row = 71 + 24 / 30  Simplifying...
Response:  First, we know that Fei has 6 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 4 crayons. So, in total, she has  6 x 4 = 24 crayons.  Next, we know that she has 21 pencils. Therefore, Fei has a total of 24 crayons + 21 pencils = 45 writing utensils.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. So, if all the buses were fully loaded, each bus would have to carry at least 98/7 = 14 students. However, since we are asked for the maximum number of seats per bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of seats per bus is 15 (14 + 1).  
So, the answer is 15."
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms and each classroom has an average of 30 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows:  84 classrooms x 30 students per classroom = 2520 students. However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that some classrooms may have fewer or more students than others. To be more accurate, let's assume that the average class size is 25 students (which is a reasonable estimate based on the given information). Then, we can recalculate the total number of students as follows:  84 classrooms x 25 students per classroom = 2100 students. Finally, since each school bus can seat 118 students, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to determine how many buses will be needed. In this case, we would need: 2100 students / 118 seats per bus = approximately 17.6 buses. Therefore, there would be around 18 school buses needed for the field trip.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many students can fit in one bus. We know that each bus has six seats, and there are 66 students per classroom. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of students who can fit in one bus as follows: Total number of students per bus = Number of seats per bus x Number of classrooms 6 x 66 = 396 students per bus Now, let's calculate the total number of buses needed for the field trip. We know that there are 67 classrooms in total, and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, the total number of students for the entire school is: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Number of students per classroom 67 x 66 = 4,282 students To determine the number of buses needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per bus: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus 4,282 / 396 = 10 buses So, we would need 10 buses for the field trip.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 classrooms in total and each classroom has 58 students, so the total number of students is 87 x 58 = 4964. Since each bus can seat two people, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses we need. Therefore, we need 4964 / 2 = 2482 buses for the school trip.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 classrooms in total and each classroom has the same number of students. So, if we divide 120 students among 24 classrooms, each classroom will have how many students?   Secondly, we know that the school bus has 84 seats in total. If we assume that each classroom sends an equal number of students to the field trip (which is reasonable), then how many students can fit in the school bus? Finally, we need to find out how many classes will be needed for all 120 students to go on the field trip.  Based on these calculations, here's our answer:   There are 24 classrooms in total, so each classroom has 5 students (120/24 = 5). The school bus has 84 seats, so we can fit 5 x 24 = 120 students on the bus. Since there are 120 students in total, we need 120/5 = 24 classes to accommodate all the students on the field trip.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 102 students in total and 22 of them do not want to go on the field trip, so the number of students who will be going on the field trip is:  
102 - 22 = 80  Next, we know that each bus can seat 8 people, so we need to divide the number of students who will be going on the field trip by the number of seats per bus to find out how many buses we need:  
80 / 8 = 10  Therefore, we need 10 buses for the field trip."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 102 classrooms in total and each bus has 99 seats. So, if all students participate in the field trip, how many buses will be needed?  102 / 99 = 1.03 (round up to the nearest whole number) = 2 buses Therefore, 2 buses will be needed for all 11 students to go on the field trip. However, 8 students do not want to participate, so we need to subtract them from the total number of students. 11 - 8 = 3 Students who will participate in the field trip = 3
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms and each bus can seat 3 people. So we need to calculate how many buses we need based on the total number of students (111).  111 / 3 = 37 buses needed for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms in total and each bus can seat 40 students. So we need to find out how many buses will be needed to transport all 92 students.   First, let's divide the number of students by the number of seats per bus: 92 / 40 = 2.3 (round up to the nearest whole number) Therefore, we need 3 buses to transport all 92 students.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 boys in Hayley's class who like to play with marbles. Secondly, each boy is given 9 marbles by Hayley. Therefore, if we multiply 11 (boys) x 9 (marbles per boy), we get:  
11 x 9 = 99 marbles  So, Hayley has 99 marbles in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Healey has 10 beads and she gives each boy 5 beads. So, if she gives 5 beads to one boy, she will have 10 - 5 = 5 beads left. If she gives 5 beads to another boy, she will have 5 - 5 = 0 beads left. Therefore, she can give beads to at most 2 boys. Now, let's consider the number of boys she gives beads to. If she gives beads to only one boy, she will have 5 beads left, which is not enough for her to give beads to another boy. So, she must give beads to two boys. Let's denote the number of boys she gives beads to as x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given: 5x + 5 = 10... (1) Since there are 5 beads in each group, we can rewrite the equation as: 5x = 10 - 5 5x = 5... (2) Solving equation (2), we get: x = 2 Therefore, Healey gave beads to 2 boys.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are four boys who like marbles very much and they will receive some marbles from Hayley. Secondly, Hayley has 23 marbles in total and she wants to keep 15 for herself. So, the total number of marbles available for the boys is 23 - 15 = 8. Now, let's divide the remaining eight marbles equally among the four boys. We can do this by dividing 8 by 4, which gives us an average of 2 marbles per boy. Therefore, each boy will receive 2 marbles from Hayley.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 boys who like playing with beads and each of them will receive 26 beads from Hayley. So, in total, they will receive  13 x 26 = 398 beads.  Next, we know that there are 50 boys who like playing cards and each of them will receive nothing (since all the beads have been given away). Therefore, they will not receive any cards.  In conclusion, Hayley has 26 beads to distribute among 13 boys, so each boy will receive 26 / 13 = 2 beads.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Hayley has 20 beads and there are two boys in her class who like to play with beads. So, if we divide 20 by 2, we get 10. Therefore, each boy can receive 10 beads from Hayley.  

Question: What is the reasoning behind your answer?  Answer: Our reasoning is based on the information provided in the question. We know that Hayley has 20 beads and there are two boys in her class who like to play with beads. To ensure fairness, we assume that she wants to distribute the beads equally among them. Since there are two boys, we divide the total number of beads (20) by the number of boys (2), which gives us 10 beads for each boy."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are x boys in the class who like to play with beads. Secondly, each boy likes to have two beads, so the total number of beads required is 2x. Finally, we know that Hayley has 28 beads and she gives one bead to each boy, so the number of boys she can give beads to is  28/2 = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read 1 page per day, so he read 14 pages in total. Second, we know that there are 392 pages in the book, so we can set up an equation to represent the situation: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages We can substitute the values we know into this equation: Number of days = 392 / 14 We can simplify this equation: Number of days = 28 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, it took Frank 28 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read 22 pages per day. Second, we know that it took him 569 days to finish reading the book. To find out how many pages there are in the book, we can use the following formula: Total number of pages = Number of pages per day x Number of days taken to finish reading the book. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total number of pages = 22 x 569 = 12,408 pages. Therefore, the book has 12,408 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read the book for 6 days. Second, we know that there are 24 chapters in the book and each chapter has an equal number of pages (since it is divided into 24 chapters). Finally, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 612. So, let's start by finding out how many pages Frank read per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading:  612 pages / 6 days =?  Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank read each day. To do this, we can divide the number of pages he read per day by the number of chapters in the book:  ? pages/day / 24 chapters/book =? pages/chapter/day  Since Frank read the book for 6 days, he must have read all 24 chapters. Therefore, the number of pages he read each day is simply the total number of pages in the book divided by the number of chapters:  612 pages / 24 chapters = 25 pages/chapter/day  So, Frank read 25 pages per day.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 555. Second, we know that Frank read the book in 220 days, so he must have read an average of 220/5 = 44 pages per day. Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter. We can set up an equation based on this information: Total Pages = Daily Pages x Number of Days Total Pages = 44 x 220 Total Pages = 9960 Therefore, there are 9960 pages in the book, and each chapter has approximately 9960 / 5 = 1992 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read the book in 660 days. Second, we know that the book has 15 chapters and each chapter is equal in length (i.e., there are no longer or shorter chapters). Finally, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 193. To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we can use the following formula: Total pages / Number of days = Daily pages So, let's plug in the numbers: 193 / 660 = 0.297 Therefore, Frank read approximately 29.7 pages per day.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read several books and each book has 249 pages. Second, we know that it took him 3 days to read all the books. Finally, we want to find out how many pages he read per day. To do this, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading: Total pages = Number of books x Pages per book = (number of books) x 249 pages = 3 days x 249 pages = 747 pages Per day, Frank read 747 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read each book in 12 days. So if he reads all books, it will take him 12 x (number of books) = 492 days to finish reading all the books. Now, let's set up an equation based on this information:  492 = 12x  X = 492 / 12  X = 40 Since there are 66 pages in each book, we can calculate how many books Frank read as follows:  40 x 66 =?  We have our answer! Frank read 40 x 66 = 2640 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read the book in 16 days. Second, we know that the book has 112 pages. To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading:  112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages/day So, Frank read 7 pages per day.
Response:  First, we know that Frank reads 8 pages per day. Second, we know that there are 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it takes for Frank to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:  576 pages / 8 pages/day = 72 days Therefore, it would take Frank 72 days to finish reading the entire book.
Response:  First, we know that there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is 41 x 450 = 18,450 pages. Next, we know that Frank read the book in 30 days, so he must have read an average of 18,450 / 30 = 615 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 615 pages per day.
Response:  First, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 594 pages. So, if Frank took 607 days to finish the book, he must have spent approximately 607/3 = 202 days on each chapter. Therefore, each chapter has approximately 202 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read two chapters of 405 pages each, for a total of 810 pages. We also know that he spent 664 days reading the book. To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading:  810 pages / 664 days = 1.23 pages/day So, Frank read approximately 1.23 pages per day.
Response:  We know that 1 pack of DVDs costs $120. If we want to find out how much one DVD costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of DVDs in the pack: $120 ÷ 1 = $120 per DVD.   Therefore, the price of one DVD is $120.
Response:  First, we know that one pack of DVDs costs $81. Next, we are asked to find out how much it would cost to buy 33 packs of DVDs. To do this, we can multiply the cost of one pack by 33. So, the calculation is:  81 x 33 = 2693  Therefore, it would cost $2693 to buy 33 packs of DVDs.
Response:  First, we know that the original price of one pack of DVDs is $107. Next, we are given a discount of $106, which means we will get a percentage off the original price. To find out how much we can buy with $93, we need to calculate the amount left after subtracting the discount from the original price.  Amount left = Original Price - Discount  Amount left = $107 - $106  Amount left = $1  Now, we divide the amount left by the cost per unit (pack) to find out how many units we can buy with $93.  Number of units = Amount left / Cost per unit  Number of units = $1 / $107  Number of units = 1/9  Number of units = 11/9  Approximately, we can buy 11 packs of DVDs with $93, since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack. Therefore, the answer is 11 packs.
Response:  First, we know that the price of one pack is $76. Next, we know that there is a 25% discount for each pack. So, if we buy one pack, we can calculate the amount we need to pay as follows:   Price per pack = $76 (original price) - ($76 x 25%) = $76 - $19 = $57   Therefore, you would need to pay $57 to purchase one pack.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many DVD packs can be bought with $104.   We know that each pack costs $26, so:   Number of packs = $104 / $26 = 4 (rounded)  Therefore, you can buy 4 DVD packs with $104.
Response:  First, we know that there are 2 packs of DVDs in total, and each pack costs $28. So, if we divide the total cost by the number of packs, we can find out the cost per pack: Total Cost = $28 x 2 packs = $56 💰 Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of packs to find out the cost per pack: $56 ÷ 2 packs = $28 per pack 📝 Therefore, the cost per pack is $28.
Response:  We have 18 bananas in total and we want to divide them into groups of 2.  18 / 2 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 9 groups of 2 bananas each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 187 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains an unknown number of bananas. Secondly, we know that there is a total of 140 groups of bananas. So, if we divide 140 by 187, we get approximately 0.75. This means that each group of bananas has approximately 0.75 bananas. Now, let's multiply 0.75 by the total number of groups (140) to find out the total number of bananas in Philip's collection: 0.75 x 140 = 105. Therefore, Philip's banana collection has 105 bananas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 203 bananas in total and they are divided into 7 groups. So each group has 203/7 = 29 bananas. Now, let's talk about oranges. There are 63 oranges in total and they are divided into 95 groups. So each group has 63/95 = 0.66 oranges. Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in one group of bananas. We can do this by dividing the number of oranges in one group (0.66) by the number of bananas in one group (29). This gives us 0.66/29 = 0.022. Therefore, there are approximately 22 oranges in one group of bananas. Finally, we can calculate the size of one group of bananas as follows:  Group size = Number of bananas per group x Number of oranges per group Group size = 29 x 0.022 = 0.66 or 22 oranges.
Response:  First, we know that there are 356 oranges in total and they are divided into 178 groups. So, each group has an average of:  356 / 178 = 2 groups per orange   Therefore, each group contains approximately half of one orange, or:  1/2 x 178 = 89 slices of oranges per group.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's banana collection and each group has an equal number of bananas. Since there are 392 bananas in total, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:  196 x = 392  where x is the number of bananas in each group. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 196:  x = 392 / 196  x = 2  Therefore, each group in Philip's banana collection has 2 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and there are 180 bananas in total. So we can calculate the number of groups as follows:  180 / 18 =?  Do you want to try?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. Therefore, each group has 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Now, let's consider the orange collection. We know that there are 87 oranges in total and they are divided into 93 groups. So, each group has approximately 0.93 oranges (87 / 93 = 0.93). Since each group of bananas has 145 bananas, we can say that each group of oranges has approximately 0.93 x 145 = 133 bananas. Therefore, the size of one group of bananas is 133 bananas.
Response:  First, we know that there are 384 oranges in total and each group has 16 oranges. So, if we divide 384 by 16, we get:  384 / 16 = 24 Therefore, one group of oranges has 24 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brenda's mother prepared 38 cookies in total. Secondly, each cookie has 19 pieces, so there are 38 x 19 = 742 pieces of cookies in total. Finally, we need to find out how many guests Brenda's mother prepared the cookies for. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces (742) by the number of pieces per guest (19): 742 / 19 = 39 guests. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared the cookies for 39 guests.
Response:  First, we know that Brenda's mother made cookies for 14 people.  Second, each person received 30 cookies.  So, to find out how many cookies Brenda's mother prepared in total, we need to multiply the number of people she made cookies for by the number of cookies each person received.  14 x 30 = 420  Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brenda's mother made 5 cookies for each of her 4 children and herself, so in total she made 5 x 5 = 25 cookies.  However, we are also given that she had to throw away 17 cookies, which means that she only gave out 25 - 17 = 8 cookies.  Since there were 4 children including Brenda's mother, each child received  8 / 4 = 2 cookies.  Therefore, Brenda received 2 cookies from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brenda prepared 18 cookies for her guests. Since only 9 guests arrived, she has 9 x 2 = 18 excess cookies (since each guest was supposed to receive 2 cookies). So, each of the 9 guests who arrived received 2 cookies, and Brenda had 18 - 9 = 9 excess cookies left over.   Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Brenda's mother made 14 cookies in total. Secondly, each of the two guests received the same number of cookies. Therefore, if we let x be the number of cookies one guest received, then the other guest also received x cookies. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  14 = 2x + 2(x)... (1) where ""2x"" represents the total number of cookies received by both guests, and ""2(x)"" represents the sum of their individual cookie counts. Simplifying equation (1), we get:  14 = 3x... (2) Solving for x, we have:   x = 4 Now, we know that each guest received 4 cookies."
Response:  Firstly, Brenda made cookies for her guests. Secondly, each guest had two cookies. Finally, there were ten cookies in total. Therefore, we can conclude that Brenda prepared cookies for five guests (2 x 5 = 10).
Response:  First, we know that Frank has 42 candies in total.  Second, he wants to divide them equally into two bags.  Finally, we want to find out how many candies will be in each bag.   To start, let's call the number of candies in one bag x. Then, we can set up an equation based on the fact that Frank has 42 candies in total:  42 = 2x Now, we need to solve for x. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:  21 = x So, there will be 21 candies in each bag if they are divided equally.
Response:  First, Frank had some candies and divided them into 33 bags of 26 each. So, he had 33 x 26 = 864 candies in total.
Response:  First, we know that Frank had 33 candies and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 candies left. Next, we need to divide the remaining 9 candies into 1-bag packs. We can do this by dividing 9 by 3 (since each bag can hold 3 candies). 9 / 3 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 3 bags of 9 candies each that Frank can make with his remaining 9 candies.
Response:  First, Frank put 11 candies in one bag. This means he has 22 - 11 = 11 candies left that he hasn't put in any bags yet. Now, we know that Frank has 11 bags of candies (since each bag contains 11 candies).
Response:  We know that Frank has 16 candies in total and he divided them equally into two bags. This means each bag contains half of the total number of candies, which is 16/2 = 8 candies per bag.
Response:  First, we know that Sharlie sold 25 cases of Trefoil boxes.  Each case contains 14 boxes, so she sold a total of  25 x 14 = 350 boxes.  Now, we need to find out how many individual boxes Sharlie needs to deliver.  To do this, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes in each case:  350 / 14 = 25. So, Sharlie needs to deliver 25 cases of Trefoil boxes.
Response:  If Sharlie sold 10 boxes of Trefoil, and each box contains 5 cases, then we can start by finding out how many cases Sharlie sold in total.   Total number of cases = Number of boxes x Number of cases per box  Total number of cases = 10 x 5  Total number of cases = 50  Now, let's find out how many boxes Sharlie needs to deliver if she delivers 5 cases at a time.  Number of boxes needed = Total number of cases / Number of cases per box  Number of boxes needed = 50 / 5  Number of boxes needed = 10  Therefore, Sharlie needs to deliver 10 boxes to deliver 50 cases of Trefoil.
Response:  First, we know that there are 67 regular sodas and 9 diet sodas in total. Next, we need to find out how many more regular sodas there are than diet sodas. To do this, we can subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas:  67 (total) - 9 (diet sodas) =?  Now we have our answer! There were 58 more regular sodas than diet sodas.
Response:  First, we know that there are 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. Next, we need to find out how many more bottles of diet soda there are compared to regular soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the number of bottles of diet soda:  61 - 22 = 39  So, there are 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 30 regular sodas and each has 6 bottles, so we can calculate how many bottles of regular soda there are as follows:  30 (regular sodas) x 6 (bottles per soda) = 180 bottles of regular soda There are 8 diet sodas, and each has 4 bottles, so we can calculate how many bottles of diet soda there are as follows:   8 (diet sodas) x 4 (bottles per soda) = 32 bottles of diet soda Finally, we know that there are 41 apples, but we don't need to count them because they aren't bottles of soda. So, the total number of bottles of soda is:  180 + 32 = 212 bottles of soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. Next, we need to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of regular soda:  79 - 53 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  79 - 53 = 26  So, there are 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. Next, we can subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are:  54 (diet soda) + 83 (regular soda) = 137 Total Bottles  Now let's subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are:  137 - 54 = 83 There are 83 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that the food store has a total of 17 bottles and 29 apples. If 9 bottles are normal soda bottles, then the number of diet soda bottles is equal to the total minus the number of normal soda bottles. So we can set up an equation as follows:   Diet Soda Bottles = Total - Normal Soda Bottles  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:   Diet Soda Bottles = 17 - 9  Simplifying, we get:   Diet Soda Bottles = 8  Therefore, there were 8 diet soda bottles at the food store.
Response:  First, we know that there are 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. Next, we need to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are compared to diet soda. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of regular soda:  60 - 19 =?  The result is: 41. So, there were 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 78 apples and 72 bottles of regular soda. Next, we can calculate how many bottles of diet soda there are based on the fact that there are 32 fewer bottles of diet soda than regular soda. So, if there are 72 bottles of regular soda, then there are 72 - 32 = 40 bottles of diet soda. Finally, we add up all the numbers to find out how many more bottles of soda there were than apples: 78 + 40 = 118. Therefore, there were 118 bottles of soda in total (78 apples + 40 diet soda).
Response:  First, we know that there are 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. Next, we know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than apples, we can subtract the number of apples from the number of bottles of regular soda:  80 - 36 = 44 So, there are 44 more bottles of regular soda than apples. Now, let's compare this to the number of bottles of diet soda:  54 - 44 = 10 There are 10 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda. Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles in total and 28 of them are normal soda bottles. That means there are only 2 slots left for diet soda bottles. So, we can say that there are 2 diet soda bottles among the 30 bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the diet soda bottles are four times as many as the regular soda bottles. So if there were x bottles of regular soda, there would be 4x bottles of diet soda. Secondly, we know that the total number of bottles is 79 more than the number of regular soda bottles. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:  4x + x = 79 + x  Simplifying this equation, we get:  5x = 79  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that:  x = 15  So there were 15 bottles of regular soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 57 regular sodas and 26 diet sodas.  Next, we know that there are 27 light sodas.  So, if we add all of these numbers together, we get:  57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles of soda.  Therefore, there were 100 bottles of soda in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 81 bottles of Regular Soda and 60 bottles of Diet Soda. Next, we can find out how many more bottles of Regular Soda there are than Diet Soda by subtracting the number of bottles of Diet Soda from the number of bottles of Regular Soda:  81 - 60 =?  Yes, there are 21 more bottles of Regular Soda than Diet Soda.
Response:  First, we know that there are 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda. Next, we know that there are 6 bottles of light soda. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  49 + 40 + 6 = 95  Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda is 95.
Response:  First, we know that there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question. We also know that there were 295 visitors the previous day. To find out how many more people visited the palace on the day in question compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the day in question.  317 - 295 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 22. Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question than there were on the previous day.
Response:  First, we know that there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before.  Second, we know that 246 people visited Buckingham Palace on this particular day.  Third, we want to find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace in total over 25 days if 246 people visited on one of those days.  To do this, we can use multiplication.   Multiply the number of visitors per day (246) by the number of days (25):  246 x 25 =?  The result is:  246 x 25 = 6150  So, over 25 days, there would be 6150 visitors to Buckingham Palace if 246 people visited on one of those days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 666 people who visited Buckingham Palace the previous day. Now, if 100 visitors came to the palace the day before, then the total number of visitors the previous day was:  666 + 100 = 766 visitors. So, there were 766 visitors at Buckingham Palace the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question.  We also know that there have been 327 days since the palace opened, and during that time, there have been a total of 406 visitors. To find out how many visitors came to the palace the previous day, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:  132/406 = x/327 where x is the number of visitors to the palace the previous day. Cross-multiplying, we get:  132 \* 327 = 406 \* x Multiplying both sides by 327, we get:  45,844 = 327x Dividing both sides by 327, we get:  x = 140 So, there were 140 visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before. Secondly, we are given that in the past 85 days, there have been a total of 829 visitors to the palace. Finally, we want to find out how many visitors came to the palace on the day after Rachel and her friends visited it. To do this, we can use division. We will divide the total number of visitors (829) by the number of visitors the previous day (45). This gives us:  829 / 45 = 18 So, on the day after Rachel and her friends visited Buckingham Palace, there were 18 visitors to the palace.
Response:  First, we know that there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends had lunch there. We also know that there were 188 visitors the previous day. To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace in 57 days, we need to multiply the number of visitors per day by 57. So, if we calculate (557 x 57), we get:  557 x 57 = 32,099  Therefore, based on the information provided, approximately 32,099 people visited Buckingham Palace in 57 days.
Response:  First, we know that there were 661 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends visited. We also know that there were 600 visitors the previous day. To find out how many more people visited Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel and her friends visited, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors on the day Rachel and her friends visited.   Total visitors on the day Rachel and her friends visited = 661  Number of visitors on the previous day = 600  Subtracting the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors on the day Rachel and her friends visited gives us:  661 - 600 = 61  Therefore, there were 61 more people who visited Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel and her friends visited compared to the previous day.
Response:  First, we know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question. We also know that there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that. To find out how many people visited the palace the day before that (the day Rachel went), we can subtract the number of visitors on the day in question (92) from the total number of visitors for the previous two days:  419 - 92 = 327  327 - 103 = 224 Therefore, there were 224 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before Rachel went.
Response:  First, we know that there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends visited. We also know that there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors two days before that. To find out how many people have visited Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up all these numbers.  512 + 471 + 808 = 1781 So, in the past 89 days, 1781 people have visited Buckingham Palace.
Response:  First, we know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day. We also know that there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors two days ago. To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace compared to the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors from each of those days from the total number of visitors over the past 245 days. Total Visitors Over Past 245 Days = 191 + 457 + 705 = 1353 Now let's calculate the difference between the number of visitors on each day and the average daily visitors over the past 245 days: Average Daily Visitors = Total Visitors / Number of Days = 1353 / 245 = 5.5 per day Difference in Visitors Per Day = (Total Visitors - Average Daily Visitors) x (Number of Days Since Last Visit) = (705 - 5.5) x 1 = 186.5 So, there were 186.5 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on that particular day than the average daily visitors over the past 245 days.
Response:  First, we know that the total amount of wax needed for the wings is 628 grams. Second, we know that the checklist has 159 grams of wax already. So, to find out how much more wax the person needs, we can subtract the amount they already have from the total amount needed:  628 - 159 = 469 grams.  Therefore, the person needs an additional 469 grams of wax.
Response:  First, we know that he needs 288g of wax for his wings. He already has 260g, so he still needs  288 - 260 = 28g more.  Next, we know that each color requires 49g of wax. So, if he wants to paint all three colors, he will need 3 x 49 = 147g of wax in total. Since he already has 260g, he only needs an additional  147 - 260 = -113g (negative because he already has some). Therefore, the amount of wax he currently possesses is  260 - 113 = 147g.
Response:  First, we know that he needs 57 grams of paint to paint his wings and body. Since each wing has two parts, let's assume he needs 28.5 grams of paint for each wing (since 28.5 is half of 57). Therefore, he needs a total of 56 grams of paint for both wings. Now, let's calculate how much wax he already has. We know that he needs 22 grams of wax for his wings, so if he already has some wax, he must have at least 22 grams. So, the difference between what he already has and what he needs is:  57 - 22 = 35 grams.  Therefore, he still needs 35 grams of wax to complete his project.
"Response:  First, we know that 20g of wax is currently available. Next, we need to find out how much more wax is required to attach the wings. According to the checklist, 166g of wax is needed for this purpose. So, we can calculate the difference between the amount of wax available and the amount required as follows:  
Difference = 166g - 20g = 146g Therefore, 146g of additional wax is required to attach the wings."
Response:  First, we know that the total weight of the wax is 557 grams (557g). Next, we are given that the current amount of wax used is 17 grams (17g), so we need to find out how much more wax is needed for each feather. To do this, we can subtract the current amount of wax used from the total weight of the wax:  557g - 17g =???g  Since there are 4 feathers in total, and each feather requires 20 grams of wax, we can divide the remaining amount of wax by 4 to find out how much wax is needed for each feather:  ???g / 4 = 20g So, the total amount of wax required for all 4 feathers would be:  4 x 20g = 80g Therefore, the answer is 80 grams (80g) of wax is needed for all 4 feathers.
Response:  First, we know that the total amount of wax needed for the wings is 492 grams. Second, we know that the person currently has 11 grams of wax. So, to find out how much more wax they need, we can subtract the amount they have from the total amount needed:  492 - 11 = 481 grams. Therefore, the person needs an additional 481 grams of wax.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 94 harvesters and they have to collect 90 drums of grapes in 6 days. So, if we divide the total number of grapes by the number of harvesters and the number of days, we can calculate how many drums each harvester needs to collect per day.  📝 Calculation: Total grapes = 90 drums Number of harvesters = 94 people Number of days = 6 days 🔢 Now, let's calculate how many drums each harvester needs to collect per day: Total grapes / Number of harvesters / Number of days = 90 drums / 94 people / 6 days 💡 Solution: Each harvester needs to collect 3 drums of grapes per day (90 drums / 94 people / 6 days). Therefore, the daily grape collection for one person is 3 drums.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 266 people working in the vineyard and they have to harvest 90 drums of grapes in 5 days. So, if we divide the total number of grapes to be harvested (90) by the number of workers (266), we get the daily amount of grapes each worker needs to harvest:  90 / 266 = 0.3333... or approximately 1/3 drum per day per worker.
Response:  First, we know that there are 294 people working in the vineyard and they can harvest 244 drums of grapes and 47 drums of raspberries per day. Next, we need to find out how many days it will take to harvest all the grapes. To do this, we divide the total number of grapes (244 drums x 30 liters/drum = 7320 liters) by the daily harvest (244 drums x 30 liters/drum = 7320 liters). This gives us: Number of days = Total amount / Daily harvest = 7320 liters / 244 drums = 29.5 days So, it will take approximately 29.5 days to harvest all the grapes if each person can harvest 244 drums per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 235 people working in the vineyard and they can harvest 100 drums of raspberries and 221 drums of grapes per day. Secondly, we know that the total number of days for which the grapes need to be harvested is 77 days. So, let's calculate how many drums of grapes will be harvested in 77 days.   Drums of Grapes = (Number of People x Daily Harvest of Grapes) x Number of Days  = (235 x 221) x 77  = 56,985 drums of grapes will be harvested in 77 days.
Response:  First, we know that there are 252 people working in the vineyard and each person can harvest 108 drums of grapes per day. So, if we multiply 252 by 108, we get: Total number of drums of grapes that can be harvested per day = 252 x 108 = 26,976 drums Now, we need to find out how many days it would take to harvest 57 barrels of wine. We know that there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), so we can divide the total number of drums by the number of days in a year: Number of drums per day = 26,976 / 365 = approximately 74 drums per day To find out how many days it would take to harvest 57 barrels, we can simply divide 57 by 74: Days required to harvest 57 barrels = 57 / 74 = approximately 77 days Therefore, it would take approximately 77 days to harvest 57 barrels of wine if each person can harvest 108 drums per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each drum can hold 8 bottles of grapes. Therefore, to harvest 240 drums of grapes, we need to collect 240 x 8 = 1920 bottles of grapes in total. Now, we are given that there are 36 people working in the vineyard and they can harvest 8 drums per day. So, if we divide the total number of bottles by the number of people working, we get:  1920 / 36 = 53 days It takes 53 days for 36 people to harvest 240 drums of grapes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 water tanks in total and each tank contains an equal number of saltwater organisms. Therefore, if we divide 52 (the total number of saltwater organisms) by 26 (the number of water tanks), we can find out how many saltwater organisms are in each tank.  52 / 26 = 2 So, there are 2 saltwater organisms in each tank.
Response:  If he had 40 marine animals in total and each water tank has 2 marine animals, then we can calculate as follows:   Total number of tanks = 40 / 2 = 20 tanks So, he had 20 water tanks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tyler has 56 water tanks for saltwater animals and each tank contains 39 animals, so the total number of saltwater animals is:  56 x 39 = 2248  Secondly, we know that Tyler also has 10 water tanks for freshwater animals, and each tank contains 39 animals as well, so the total number of freshwater animals is:  10 x 39 = 390  Therefore, in total, Tyler has 2248 + 390 = 2638 animals.
Response:  First, we know that Tyler has 22 water tanks for marine animals. Next, we need to find out how many animals he has in each tank. Since there are 46 animals per tank, and he has 22 tanks, he has a total of  22 x 46 = 992 animals.  So, Tyler has 992 marine animals.
Response:  First, we know that he has 15 saltwater aquariums and each one contains 19 fish, so the total number of fish in the saltwater aquariums is:  15 x 19 = 285 fish  Next, we know that he has 62 freshwater aquariums and each one contains 19 fish as well, so the total number of fish in the freshwater aquariums is:  62 x 19 = 1178 fish In total, he has 285 + 1178 = 1463 fish.

Response:  Firstly, we know that each block has 5 junk mails and there are 25 households in total for one block. So, if we divide 25 by 5, we get:  25 / 5 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 blocks in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 houses in each block and 9 junk mails to be delivered to each house. So, the total number of junk mails to be delivered in one block is:  20 x 9 = 180 junk mails.  Therefore, for one block with 20 houses, we need to deliver 180 junk mails.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many junk mails each house should receive based on the total number of junk mails and the number of houses in each block.   Total number of junk mails = 24 (given) Number of houses in each block = 6 (given) Therefore, the average number of junk mails per house in each block is: Average number of junk mails per house = Total number of junk mails / Number of houses in each block = 24 / 6 = 4 So, each house in each block should receive 4 junk mails.
Response:  We know that there are 14 junk mails in total and each block needs to receive 2 junk mails. So we can start by dividing 14 by 2 to get the number of blocks needed:  14 / 2 = 7   Now we need to find out how many households are in each block. Since each block has 2 junk mails, we can divide 7 (the number of blocks) by 2 to get the number of households per block:   7 / 2 = 3   Therefore, there are 3 households in each block.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 houses in each block and 32 pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each house. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each block is:  
20 x 32 = 640 pieces of junk mail per block.  Since there are 5 blocks in total, the total number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered is:  
640 x 5 = 3200 pieces of junk mail."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pieces of junk mail in total for each block. Since there are 19 houses in one block and 30 pieces of junk mail per house, the total number of pieces of junk mail for each block is:  
30 x 19 = 540 pieces of junk mail per block.  Next, since there are 78 blocks in total, we can multiply the total number of pieces of junk mail per block by 78 to get the grand total:  
540 x 78 = 41,120 pieces of junk mail."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 junk mails in each block.  Secondly, we know that the postman delivers 32 pieces of mail to each house in total.  Finally, we want to find out how many houses there are in one block.   So let's start with the first block.  If there are 8 junk mails in the first block, and each house receives 32 pieces of mail, then the number of houses in the first block is:  8 / 32 = 1/4 or 4 houses per block.  Therefore, there are 4 houses in one block.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many houses there are in total for each block. Since each block has 12 houses, and there are 81 blocks, the total number of houses is:  81 x 12 = 972 houses. Next, we need to calculate how many junk mail pieces each house needs. Since there are 4 junk mail pieces per house, the total number of junk mail pieces needed is:  972 x 4 = 3888 junk mail pieces. Therefore, the delivery person needs to deliver 3888 junk mail pieces in total.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many houses there are in total. We know that each block has 17 houses, and there are 16 blocks, so the total number of houses is:  17 x 16 = 272 houses. Next, we need to calculate how many junk mail pieces each house receives. We are told that each house receives 4 pieces of junk mail, so the total number of junk mail pieces is:  272 x 4 = 1088 pieces.

Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 stones. Next, she wants to divide the stones into four groups. So, if we divide 20 stones equally among four groups, each group will receive 5 stones (20 / 4 = 5). Now, let's check how many eggs are left over after dividing the stones. We have 10 eggs - 5 stones = 5 eggs remaining. Therefore, there will be five groups of five stones and one egg leftover.
"Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs.  Next, she wants to divide the eggs into 5 groups.  To do this, we can use all of her marbles as ""divisors"" to distribute the eggs evenly among the groups.   Here is one way to do it:   Group 1: 3 eggs (using 2 marbles) Group 2: 4 eggs (using 3 marbles) Group 3: 3 eggs (using 2 marbles) Group 4: 4 eggs (using 3 marbles) Group 5: 2 eggs (using 1 marble)  Since each group contains an odd number of eggs, no group will have any leftover eggs.  Therefore, all 15 eggs are used up in the division!"
Response:  If Rebecca has 11 groups and each group contains 2 eggs, then she has a total of 11 x 2 = 22 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. Next, she wants to divide the eggs into 4 groups, so each group will have how many eggs?   To find out, let's divide 8 by 4: 8 ÷ 4 =?  Do you know the answer? It's 2! So, each group will have 2 eggs.  Now, what about the marbles? Since there are 6 marbles in total, and Rebecca wants to divide them equally among the 4 groups, each group will get how many marbles?  If we divide 6 by 4, we get: 6 ÷ 4 =?  Can you tell me the answer? It's also 1! So, each group will have 1 marble.
Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs.  Second, she wants to divide the eggs into 3 groups.  Finally, each group should have an equal number of eggs.   To solve this problem, we can use division.  Specifically, we can divide 15 (the total number of eggs) by 3 (the number of groups).  Here's the calculation:  15 ÷ 3 = 5  So, each group will have 5 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 18 eggs in total.  Second, she wants to divide them into groups of 6 each. Third, we can calculate how many groups she can make using the division method:  18 / 6 =?  The result is:  18 / 6 = 3  So, Rebecca can create 3 groups of 6 eggs each.
"Response:  First, we need to divide 9 eggs into groups so that each group has an equal number of eggs. Since there are 9 eggs and we want each group to have the same number of eggs, we can divide them into 3 groups of 3 eggs each. Now, let's use the bananas and marbles to make up the remaining eggs in each group. We have 99 bananas and 27 marbles. We can use the bananas to fill in any gaps in the groups, since each banana is worth 3 eggs. So, if we have 3 eggs left over after dividing the eggs into groups, we can use 1 banana to ""buy"" 3 more eggs, giving us a total of 9 eggs in each group. Therefore, we can create 3 groups of 9 eggs each using the following distribution: Group 1: 3 eggs + 3 bananas = 9 eggs Group 2: 3 eggs + 3 bananas = 9 eggs Group 3: 3 eggs + 3 marbles = 9 eggs"
Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles.   Next, we need to find out how many groups of 5 eggs she can make with her 20 eggs. We can do this by dividing 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4 With 4 remaining. So, Rebecca can make 4 groups of 5 eggs each. Now let's look at the number of marbles she has. She has 6 marbles. If she puts one marble in each group of eggs, she will have 6 marbles left over. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles. Specifically, she has 20 - 6 = 14 more eggs than marbles.
Response:  First, we know that Rebecca has 5 beads and 12 eggs. We can start by counting how many groups of 4 eggs she can make with her 12 eggs.  12 / 4 = 3 So, Rebecca can make 3 groups of 4 eggs each. Now, let's count how many eggs are left over after making these 3 groups. 12 - 3 x 4 = 12 - 12 = 0! There are no eggs left over. Therefore, Rebecca has enough eggs to make exactly 3 groups of 4 eggs each.
Response:  We know that Luke scored 154 points in total and he got 11 points per round. So we can calculate how many rounds he played as follows:  154 / 11 = 14 Round(s) Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds of trivia games to score 154 points.
Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of Trivial Pursuit and gained 46 points per round, we can calculate how many points he obtained in total as follows:  177 rounds x 46 points/round = 8,222 points  Therefore, Luke obtained 8,222 points in the game.
Response:  We know that Luke scored 84 points in total and played two rounds of trivia games. Therefore, we can calculate the number of points he scored in each round as follows:  84 points / 2 rounds = 42 points per round So, Luke scored 42 points in each round of the trivia game.
Response:  First, we know that Luke obtained 146 points in each round of the game. Second, we are told that he played 157 rounds. So, to find out how many points Luke obtained overall, we need to multiply the number of points he got per round by the total number of rounds he played:  146 x 157 = 23,092 points. Therefore, Luke obtained 23,092 points in the game.
Response:  We know that Luke has obtained 3 points in each round of the trivia game and has obtained a total of 78 points. To find out how many rounds he played, we can divide 78 by 3:  78 / 3 =?  The result is: 26 So, Luke played 26 rounds of the trivia game.
Response:  Emily has 2 beads and she can make 32 necklaces. So, if we divide 32 by 2, we get 16. Therefore, one necklace requires 16 beads.
Response:  Firstly, Emily made 11 necklaces in total. Secondly, each necklace requires 28 beads. Therefore, to calculate the total number of beads required for all 11 necklaces, we can multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace. So, the total number of beads = 11 x 28 = 338 beads.
Response:  Emily has 16 beads and needs 8 beads for each necklace. So she can make:  16 / 8 = 2 necklaces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Emily made 18 necklaces and each necklace requires beads. So, if she had 6 beads, how many necklaces could she make? To find out, we can divide 6 (the number of beads) by the number of beads required for one necklace. In this case, let's assume that one necklace requires x beads. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  6 / x = 18 Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x:  6 / x = 18 x x = 6x 6x = 18x x = 3 Since there are 3 beads required for one necklace, Emily could make 6 x 3 = 18 necklaces with 6 beads.
Response:  Emily made 4 necklaces, and each necklace requires 5 beads. So she needs 4 x 5 = 20 beads in total. Since she has 20 beads, she can make 4 necklaces.
Response:  Firstly, Emily has 6 beads and each necklace requires 3 beads. So she can make 6/3 = 2 necklaces.   Therefore, Emily can make 2 necklaces with 3 beads each.
Response:  Emily has 5 beads and wants to make 20 necklaces. So she needs to use each bead in 20/5 = 4 necklaces. Therefore, one necklace requires 4 beads.
Response:  Firstly, Emily made 26 necklaces in total. Secondly, each necklace requires two beads. Therefore, to make one necklace, she needs two beads. Now, let's calculate how many beads Emily has altogether.   To make 26 necklaces, she needs 26 x 2 = 52 beads in total.  So, Emily has 52 beads in all.
Response:  First, we know that 819058 children went to camp and 668278 children stayed at home. To find out how many more children went to camp than stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the number of children who went to camp.  819058 - 668278 =?  The difference between these two numbers is 150780. So, there were 150780 more children who went to camp than stayed at home.
Response:  First, we know that 202,958 children went to camp in Lawrence County.  Second, we know that there were a total of 777,622 children who did not go to camp (since they stayed at home).  So, if we subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children, we can find out how many more children stayed at home:  777,622 - 202,958 = 574,664  Therefore, there are 574,664 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
Response:  First, we know that there are 898,051 children in Lawrence County. Next, we know that 629,424 of them went to camp during summer vacation, leaving us with the number of children who did not go to camp. To find out how many children did not go to camp, we can subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children:  898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627 So, there are 268,627 children who did not go to camp and stayed at home.
Response:  First, we know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County. Second, we know that 274,865 children will be at home during summer break. Third, we want to find out how many children will go to camp. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children who will be at home from the total number of children. So, the difference between 313,473 and 274,865 is:  313,473 - 274,865 = 38,608. Therefore, approximately 38,608 children in Lawrence County will go to camp during summer break.
Response:  First, we know that there are 907,611 children at home in Lawrence County and 455,682 children attending camp. So, to find out how many children are in Lawrence County altogether, we need to add these two numbers together.  907,611 + 455,682 = 1,363,293 This means that approximately 1,363,293 children live in Lawrence County.
"Response:  First, we know that 800059 children went to camp, so the number of children who stayed at home is equal to the total number of children in Lawrence County minus 800059.  
We are given that the total number of children in Lawrence County is 828521. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home can be calculated as follows: 
Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children in Lawrence County - Number of children who went to camp 
= 828521 - 800059 
= 284662 
So approximately, 284662 children stayed at home during summer vacation."
Response:  First, we know that 61619 children were at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County. Second, we know that there are a total of 91676 children in Lawrence County. Third, we want to find out how many children went to camp. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who were at home from the total number of children in Lawrence County. So, if we subtract 61619 from 91676, we get:  91676 - 61619 = 30057 This means that approximately 30057 children in Lawrence County went to camp.
Response:  First, we know that in Lawrence County, there were 34044 children who went to camp. Secondly, there were 134867 children who stayed at home in the county. Finally, there were 424944 children from outside the county who participated in the camp. To find out how many children participated in the camp altogether, we need to add up all these numbers:  34044 + 134867 + 424944 = 599855 children participated in the camp.
Response:  First, we know that there are 610,769 children in Lawrence County who went to camp. Secondly, we know that there are 590,796 children who stayed at home. Finally, we know that 22 children from outside the county participated in the camp. To find out how many children are in Lawrence County in total, we need to add up all these numbers:  610,769 + 590,796 + 22 = 1,223,587 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  First, we know that there are 644,997 children at home in Lawrence County and 893,835 children attending camp outside of the county. So, to find out how many children are in Lawrence County, we need to subtract the number of children attending camp from the total number of children.  644,997 - 893,835 = -248,838 This means that there are 248,838 fewer children in Lawrence County than there would be if all the children were at home. Now, let's add the number of children who came from other counties (78) to the difference we just found:  248,838 + 78 = 248,916 So, there are approximately 248,916 children in Lawrence County during summer vacation.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 3 fewer apples than Adam. So we can start by finding out how many apples Jackie has:  
Jackie has 9 - 3 = 6 apples.  Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples."
Response:  Adam has 10 raspberries and Jackie has 2 raspberries. To find out how many more raspberries Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of raspberries that Jackie has from the number of raspberries that Adam has.  10 - 2 =?  The difference is 8. So, Adam has 8 more raspberries than Jackie.
Response:  Adam has 9 rhinestones and Jackie has 10 rhinestones. To find out how many more rhinestones Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of rhinestones that Adam has from the number of rhinestones that Jackie has. So, we can say:  10 - 9 =?  That gives us our answer! Jackie has 1 more rhinestone than Adam.
Response:  First, we know that Jackie has 10 raspberries and Adam has 8 raspberries. Next, we need to find out how many more raspberries Jackie has than Adam. To do this, we can subtract the number of raspberries Adam has from the number of raspberries Jackie has:  10 - 8 = 2 So, Jackie has 2 more raspberries than Adam.
Response:  Adam and Jackie have a total of 6 apples between them. If one person has 4 more apples than the other, then we can let X be the number of apples that Adam has and Y be the number of apples that Jackie has. We know that X + Y = 6 (total number of apples). Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, we can write: X = Y + 4. Now we have two equations: X + Y = 6 and X = Y + 4. Can you solve for X and Y?
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have a total of 9 more apples than they do together. So if we add up their individual amounts, we get:  7 (Adam) + 7 (Jackie) = 14  Now, let's subtract the amount they have together from the total to find out how many extra apples each has:  14 - 14 = 0  So, neither Adam nor Jackie has any extra apples!
"Response:  Firstly, Adam has 8 apples more than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 8 apples.  
Secondly, together they have 12 apples in total. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: 
x + (x + 8) = 12 
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 8 = 12 
Subtracting 8 from both sides:  
2x = 4 
Dividing both sides by 2:  
x = 2 
So, Jackie has 2 apples and Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples."
Response:  Firstly, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has x apples, Adam has x + 4 apples. Secondly, we know that together they have 2 apples. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: x + (x + 4) = 2. Simplifying this equation, we get:  2x + 4 = 2. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  2x = 2. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 1. Now we know that Jackie has 1 apple and Adam has 1 + 4 = 5 apples. Therefore, Adam has 5 apples in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam has more oranges than Jackie because he has 5 more oranges. So, if Jackie has 89 oranges, then Adam must have 89 + 5 = 94 oranges. Now, let's look at the number of mandarins they both possess. We are given that Jackie has 11 mandarins and since Adam has more mandarins than Jackie, Adam must also have 11 mandarins. Therefore, Adam possesses 94 oranges and 11 mandarins in total.
Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday.   Next, we know that she baked 270 cookies this morning. Finally, we know that she baked 419 cookies in total (since yesterday). To find out how many cookies Helen baked last night, we need to subtract the number of cookies she baked this morning from the total number of cookies she baked:  270 - 31 = 239 cookies Last night, Helen baked 239 cookies.
Response:  First, Helen baked 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday. Today, she baked 51 lemon cookies and 484 chocolate chip cookies. In total, how many chocolate chip cookies did Helen bake? To find out, we need to add the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked yesterday and today. Yesterday: 90 cookies Today: 484 cookies Total: 90 + 484 = 574 chocolate chip cookies Therefore, Helen baked 574 chocolate chip cookies in total.
Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies yesterday. Today, she baked 86 lemon cookies and 554 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen baked 527 + 86 = 613 cookies today. However, we are asked how many chocolate chip cookies Helen baked, not how many cookies she baked in total. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of lemon cookies she baked from the total number of cookies she baked:  613 - 86 = 527.  Thus, Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies today.
Response:  First, Helen baked 397 lemon cookies yesterday. Today, she baked 85 more lemon cookies and 403 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen baked 397 + 85 = 482 lemon cookies.

Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 231 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 237 today. So, in total, she has baked 231 + 237 = 468 chocolate chip cookies. Next, we are asked how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked than lemon cookies. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of lemon cookies from the total number of chocolate chip cookies. In this case, we can do:  468 - 231 = 237. Therefore, Helen baked 237 more chocolate chip cookies than lemon cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 46 lemon cookies. Today, she baked 75 lemon cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies. To find out how many more chocolate chip cookies Helen baked today compared to yesterday, we need to subtract the number of lemon cookies she baked yesterday from the number of lemon cookies she baked today.  75 - 46 = 29 So, Helen baked 29 more chocolate chip cookies today than she did yesterday.
Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 300 lemon cookies yesterday and 280 lemon cookies today. So, if we subtract the number of lemon cookies she baked yesterday from the number she baked today, we get:  280 - 300 = 20  Therefore, Helen baked 20 more lemon cookies today than she did yesterday. Next, we know that Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 359 chocolate chip cookies today. So, if we subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked yesterday from the number she baked today, we get:  359 - 519 = -160  Therefore, Helen baked 160 fewer chocolate chip cookies today than she did yesterday.
Response:  First, we know that Keity has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, to find out how many more games Keity has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has.  81 - 59 =?  Yes, that's right! Keity has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Katie has 91 games.  Second, her new friends have 88 games.  Third, her old friends have 53 games.  To find out how many games Katie's friends have in total, we need to add up the number of games each friend has:   New Friends: 88 games Old Friends: 53 games Total: 88 + 53 = 141 games So, Katie's friends have a total of 141 games.
Response:  First, we know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together, they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.   Next, we know that Katie also has 86 old games, so she has a total of 126 (new) + 86 (old) = 212 games in all.
Response:  First, we know that Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so the total number of games she has is:  84 + 19 = 103 games.  Now, her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so the total number of games they have is:  8 + 69 = 77 games.  Therefore, together, Katie and her friends have a total of:  103 + 77 = 180 games.
Response:  First, we know that Katie has 62 new games and 80 old games, so the total number of games she has is:  62 + 80 = 142 games.  Now, let's look at her friends. They have 73 new games and 41 old games, so the total number of games they have is:  73 + 41 = 114 games.  To find out how many old games they have in common, we need to subtract the number of new games they have from the total number of games they have:  114 - 73 = 41 games.  Therefore, Katie and her friends have 41 old games in common.
Response:  First, we know that Keity has 63 DS games.  Second, we know that her friends have 57 games.  To find out how many more games Keity has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has.  63 - 57 =?  Yes, that's right! Keity has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Keity has 57 new games and 39 old games, so the total number of games she has is:  57 + 39 = 96  Next, we are told that her friends have 34 new games, so the total number of games they have is:  34 + (old games) =?  We don't know how many old games her friends have, but we do know that Keity has more old games than her friends, since she has 39 old games and her friends only have 34 new games. So, we can subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of games Keity has to find out how many old games she has:  96 - 34 = 62  Therefore, Keity has 62 old games.
Response:  First, we know that Jason had $19 before he washed the car.   Next, we know that he earned $33 from washing the car. So, in total, Jason has $19 + $33 = $52.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $86 and spent $5, so he has $86 - $5 = $81 left.  Next, we know that Jason didn't work and doesn't have any money.  So, their current total amount of money is $81 + $0 = $81.   Therefore, the answer is $81.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $19 and Jason had $16 at the beginning of the weekend.  Next, we know that they both earned money washing cars over the weekend.  So, let's add what each of them earned to their original amount.   For Fred, he started with $19 and earned $40, so his total is:   $19 + $40 = $59  For Jason, he started with $16 and earned $69, so his total is:   $16 + $69 = $85  Therefore, Fred earned $59 and Jason earned $85 over the weekend.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $114 and Jason had $22 at the beginning of the weekend.  Next, we know that after washing their cars, Fred has $21 left and Jason has $78 left.  So, to find out how much Jason earned, we need to subtract what he spent on car washing from his initial amount.   Jason spent $22 - $78 = $56 on car washing.  Therefore, Jason earned $56 over the weekend.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $111 and Jason had $40 at the beginning of the weekend.  Next, we know that Fred spent money to wash his car, so he has $115 now (he gained $4).  We also know that Jason delivered newspapers and earned money, so he has $44 now (he gained $4).   Therefore, Fred made $4 more than Jason did.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $49 and spent $x to wash his car. So, he has $49 - x dollars now.  Second, we know that Jason had $3 and earned y dollars from delivering newspapers. So, he has $3 + y dollars now.  Now, let's add up their total amounts:  Fred has $49 - x + 112 = 112 + x dollars now.  Jason has $3 + y + 63 = 63 + y dollars now.  To find out how much they earned in total, we need to subtract their initial amounts from their current amounts:  Fred earned $112 - $49 = $63.  Jason earned $63 - $3 = $60.  Therefore, Fred earned $63 and Jason earned $60.
"Response:  First, we know that Jason delivered newspapers and earned $14.  Next, we know that Fred washed his car over the weekend and earned $90.  So, in total, they earned:  
$14 + $90 = $104  Therefore, they earned $104 together."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $33 before the weekend.  Then, he made $16 delivering newspapers and $74 washing cars, for a total of $90.  So, Fred earned $90 over the weekend.
"Response:  First, we know that Fred had $47 last week.  Then, he made $111 delivering newspapers and $34 washing cars, so he has a total of:  
$47 + $111 + $34 = $192  
Therefore, Fred now has $192."
Response:  First, we know that Jesse started jogging every day and lost 20 kilograms. So, her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 51 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie has lost 101 kilograms since she started jogging every day. Next, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  101 kg = (current weight - starting weight) We don't know Jessie's current weight, but we do know her starting weight is 27 kilograms less than her current weight. So we can write:  101 kg = (current weight - 27 kg) Now solve for the current weight:  101 kg = (current weight - 27 kg) + 27 kg Subtracting 27 kg from both sides gives us:  74 kg = current weight To find Jessie's starting weight, add 27 kg to her current weight:  27 kg + 74 kg = starting weight Starting weight = 98 kg Therefore, before Jessie started jogging every day, her weight was approximately 98 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 126 kilograms. Second, we know that her current weight is 66 kilograms. Finally, we want to find out what her weight was before she started jogging. To do this, we can subtract her current weight from the amount she lost:  66 kg - 126 kg =?  The answer is:  Jessie weighed 60 kilograms (66 kg - 126 kg) before she started jogging.
Response:  First, we know that Jesse started jogging every day and lost 35 kilograms. We also know that her current weight is less than her previous weight before she started jogging. So, if her previous weight was 69 kilograms, then her current weight would be:  69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg Therefore, Jesse currently weighs 34 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 50 kilograms in the first week and then another 60 kilograms in the second week. So, if we add up these two amounts, she has lost a total of 50 + 60 = 110 kilograms. Since Jessie started at 114 kilograms, she now weighs 114 - 110 = 4 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 4 kilograms less than her starting weight of 114 kilograms, which is 110 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 62 kg in the first week and then another 140 kg in the second week. So, if we add up these two amounts, we get:  62 + 140 = 202 kg Total weight loss in two weeks. Now, we are asked to find out what Jessie's initial body weight was before she started jogging. To do this, we can use the fact that her total weight loss is equal to the difference between her current weight and her initial weight. So, we can set up an equation like this: Current weight - Initial weight = Total weight loss We know that Jessie currently weighs 9 kg, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 9 - Initial weight = 202 kg Solving for the initial weight, we get: Initial weight = 211 kg Therefore, Jessie's initial body weight before she started jogging was approximately 211 kg.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 56 kilograms in the first week and then another 99 kilograms in the second week. So, if we add up these two amounts, she has lost a total of 56 + 99 = 155 kilograms. Now, let's subtract this amount from her initial weight of 92 kilograms to find out how much she weighs now: 92 - 155 = 67 kilograms. Therefore, after two weeks of jogging, Jessie weighs 67 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 95 snakes in total and 64 of them are hidden. Therefore, the number of visible snakes is:  95 - 64 = 31. So, there are 31 visible snakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 97 snakes in total and 40 of them are hiding. Therefore, the number of visible snakes is 97 - 40 = 57. So, there are 57 visible snakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 75 crocodiles and 3 snakes in total. If 82 snakes were hidden, then there would be 75 + 82 = 157 animals in total. However, since there are only 19 crocodiles hidden, the number of snakes hidden must be equal to 157 - 19 = 138. Therefore, there are 138 snakes hidden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 79 animals in total in the cage. Secondly, we know that there are 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles that are not hidden. Therefore, the number of hidden animals is equal to the total minus the sum of the numbers of snakes and crocodiles, which can be represented as follows:  79 - (24 + 51) =? Solution: We can calculate as follows: 79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4 The correct answer is 4. There are 4 hidden animals in the cage besides the snakes and crocodiles.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday, the farmer picked 134 tomatoes out of the total of 171. So, today, there are 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left.   Now, we know that today, the farmer picked 30 tomatoes. So, after today, there are 37 - 30 = 7 tomatoes left. Therefore, at the end of today, there will be 7 tomatoes left in the garden.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer harvested 56 tomatoes yesterday, so there are 56 fewer tomatoes today than there were yesterday.  Now, let's find out how many tomatoes the farmer has left today.  We can do this by subtracting the number of tomatoes harvested yesterday from the total number of tomatoes the farmer had:   Total tomatoes - Harvested tomatoes = Remaining tomatoes  160 - 56 =?  So, the farmer has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left today.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday, the farmer picked 154 tomatoes. Today, he picked 50 tomatoes. So, in total, the farmer has picked  154 + 50 = 204 tomatoes.  Now, let's find out how many tomatoes the farmer had at the beginning of today. We know that he had 90 tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 50 tomatoes today, then he must have had 90 - 50 = 40 tomatoes left in his garden. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes the farmer had was 90 + 204 = 394 tomatoes.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes. If he harvested 172 potatoes, then he has 77 - 172 = 95 potatoes left. Now, let's find out how many tomatoes are left. We can set up an equation based on the information given:  Tomatoes + Potatoes = Total Crops  Tomatoes = 175  Potatoes = 95  Total Crops =?  To solve for the total crops, we add the two equations together:  175 + 95 = 270  Therefore, there are 270 total crops left after the farmer harvested 172 potatoes.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer has 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes. If he picks 53 tomatoes, how many are left?   We can start by subtracting 53 from 177: 177 - 53 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 124 tomatoes left. Now, what about the potatoes? The farmer still has all 12 of them. So, there are 12 potatoes left.   Therefore, after the farmer picks 53 tomatoes, there are 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left in the garden.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, so he has a total of 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes.  Next, we know that the farmer picked 137 tomatoes, so the number of tomatoes left is 176 - 137 = 39.  Therefore, there are 39 tomatoes left after the farmer picked 137 tomatoes.
Response:  We know that each wood plank needs two nails to be fixed, and there are four nails in total for all the wood planks. So we can start with the fact that two nails are needed for one wood plank. Now let's consider how many wood planks will be required based on the number of nails available. If there are four nails in total, then we can fix two wood planks using those four nails. Therefore, we need twice as many wood planks as the number of nails available. In this case, we need twice 4 = 8 wood planks. So the answer is 8 wood planks.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 13 large wooden planks needed for the walls of the house. Each plank requires 17 nails, so in total, we need  13 x 17 = 221 nails for the large planks. Next, we know that some small wooden pieces require 8 nails each. Since there are several such pieces, let's assume (for simplicity) that there are x such pieces. Therefore, the total number of nails required for all the small pieces is x x 8 = 8x nails. Now, adding up all the nails required, we get: 221 + 8x Total number of nails =...  To find the total number of nails, we can solve this equation. Simplifying and solving for the variable ""x"", we get: 221 + 8x = 229 or x = 26 The answer to the question is: John needs 229 nails to build the wall of his house."
Response:  We know that each plank needs 3 nails, and there are 8 nails left over after attaching all the planks. So we can start with the number of planks that use up all 8 nails:  8 nails / 3 nails per plank = 2 planks  Now we have 2 planks left over, so we need to find out how many more planks we can attach using the remaining nails. We have 3 nails left over for each plank, so we can attach one more plank:  3 nails / 3 nails per plank = 1 plank  Therefore, John needs 2 + 1 = 3 planks in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 large wooden planks and 10 small wooden planks in total.  Secondly, each large wooden plank requires 15 nails to be fixed, so altogether, we need 12 x 15 = 180 nails for the large wooden planks.  Thirdly, each small wooden plank requires 5 nails to be fixed, so altogether, we need 10 x 5 = 50 nails for the small wooden planks.  Therefore, the total number of nails required for both types of wooden planks is 180 + 50 = 230 nails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John needs 16 wooden planks to build the wall of his house. Secondly, each plank requires two nails. Therefore, the total number of nails required can be calculated as follows: Total number of nails = Number of planks x Number of nails per plank Total number of nails = 16 x 2 Total number of nails = 32 So, John will need 32 nails to build the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that there are 8 large wooden planks used for the walls of John's house, and each plank requires 74 nails. To find out how many planks are needed, we can divide the total number of nails required by the number of nails per plank:   Total number of nails = 74 x 8 = 600 nails  Since each plank requires 74 nails, we can divide 600 by 74 to get the number of planks needed:   Number of planks = 600 / 74 = 8 planks Therefore, John needs 8 large wooden planks for his house's walls.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 large wooden planks and 17 small wooden planks in total. Secondly, each large wooden plank requires 14 nails, so we need to divide 12 by 14 to find out how many large wooden planks can be made. Thirdly, each small wooden plank requires 25 nails, so we need to divide 17 by 25 to find out how many small wooden planks can be made. Finally, we add up all the large and small wooden planks to get the total number of planks needed for the wall.   Numerical answer:  12 / 14 = 8 large wooden planks (remainder 0)  17 / 25 = 6 small wooden planks (remainder 9) Total number of planks needed = 8 + 6 + 9 = 23 planks
Response:  We know that each package contains 3 pieces of gum, and there are a total of 42 pieces of gum. So if we divide 42 by 3, we get:  42 / 3 = 14 Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.
Response:  First, Robin has 43 packages of gum, and each package contains 23 pieces of gum. So, how many pieces of gum does Robin have in total?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of packages (43) by the number of pieces in each package (23): 43 x 23 =?  That gives us a total of: 43 x 23 = 969 pieces of gum!  But wait, there's more - Robin also has 8 extra pieces of gum. So, our final answer is: 969 + 8 = 977 pieces of gum that Robin has altogether.
Response:  Firstly, Robin has 6 extra gums in addition to those in the packages. So, if each package contains 7 gums, then Robin has 6 + 7 = 13 gums that are not in any packages. Now, let's count how many packages Robin has based on the remaining gums. Since there are 41 gums in total and 13 of them are not in any packages, we can conclude that Robin has 41 - 13 = 28 packages. Therefore, the answer is 28.
Response:  First, we know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces of gum. So, to find out how many pieces of gum Robin has in total, we can multiply 28 (packages) x 4 (pieces per package):  28 x 4 = 112  Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of gum in total.
Response:  First, Robin has 21 packages of gum, and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. So, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum in total. Next, Robin has 45 packages of candy, and each package contains 9 candies as well. Therefore, Robin has 45 x 9 = 405 candies in total. In conclusion, Robin has a total of 189 + 405 = 694 items (gum and candies) with her.
"Response:  First, we know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 6 pieces of gum. So, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is:  
28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum. Next, we know that Robin has 14 packages of candy and each package contains 6 pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy Robin has is:  
14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of sweets Robin has is the sum of the two amounts:  
168 + 84 = 252 sweets."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 3 shirts in 1 minute. So, if the machine produced 6 shirts, it must have operated for:  6 / 3 = 2 minutes.  Therefore, the machine operated for 2 minutes to produce all 6 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can produce 4 shirts per minute and it worked for 5 minutes, we need to calculate how many shirts it produced in total.  5 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute) Now, let's multiply the number of seconds by the number of shirts per second: 300 seconds x 4 shirts/minute = 1200 shirts So, the machine produced 1200 shirts during those 5 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that the machine can produce 3 shirts per minute.  Second, we know that yesterday it produced 9 shirts in total.  Third, we know that today it produced 44 shirts in total.  Now let's calculate how many minutes the machine worked yesterday and today.   Yesterday: Total number of shirts = 9 Number of shirts per minute = 3 So, the machine worked for: 9 / 3 = 3 minutes Today: Total number of shirts = 44 Number of shirts per minute = 3 So, the machine worked for: 44 / 3 = 14 minutes Therefore, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday and 14 minutes today.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in one day, so it took 13 minutes to make all 13 shirts. Today, the machine made 3 shirts in one day, so it took 3 minutes to make all 3 shirts. To find out how many minutes the machine worked in total, we need to add the time it took to make the shirts yesterday and today. Therefore, the total number of minutes the machine worked is:  13 + 3 = 16 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday the machine made 9 shirts in 1 minute. So, the machine can make 1 shirt in 9/60 = 1/6 minutes. Now, we are asked how long the machine worked today. We know it made 8 shirts, so we can set up an equation based on this information: Machine Time = Number of Shirts / Machine Speed. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Machine Time = 8 / (1/6) = 8 x 6 = 48 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 48 minutes today.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday the machine produced 4 shirts in 1 minute. So, the machine can produce 4/60 = 2/30 (or 2/3) shirts per minute. Today, the machine produced 8 shirts in 1 minute, so it can also produce 8/60 = 4/30 (or 4/3) shirts per minute. Now, let's find out how many minutes the machine worked in total. Yesterday, the machine worked for 1 minute, and today it worked for 1 minute as well. Therefore, the total number of minutes the machine worked is:  1 + 1 = 2 minutes.
"Response:  First, we know that the machine can produce 6 shirts per minute.  Second, we know that yesterday the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced x shirts (since we don't know how many shirts it produced).  Third, we know that today the machine worked for 14 minutes and produced y shirts (where y is greater than or equal to x since the machine worked for more time today than it did yesterday).  Now let's set up an equation based on this information:  6x + 6y =?  Here, x represents the number of shirts produced yesterday, and y represents the number of shirts produced today.  We want to find out the total number of shirts produced by both days combined.  So our goal is to solve for the variable ""?"" in the equation above.  To do so, we need to add the two equations together:  6x + 6y = 6(12) + 6(14)  Simplifying this expression gives us:  6x + 6y = 72 + 84  Combine like terms:  6x + 6y = 156  Now solve for x:  x = 156 / 6  x = 26  Therefore, the machine produced 26 shirts yesterday and 84 shirts today, for a total of 110 shirts over both days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 6 shirts in 1 minute. So, if it worked for 5 minutes yesterday, it produced 5 x 6 = 30 shirts.  Now, we are told that today, the machine produced 12 shirts. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  12 = 6x + 30  Solving for x, we get:  12 = 6x + 30  Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:  12 - 30 = 6x + 30 - 30  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  9 = 6x  Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:  9 / 6 = x  Therefore, the machine produced 9 shirts today.
Response:  We know that the carnival game earned $165 in total over 5 days. That means each day it earned $33 (165 / 5). So, the daily earnings were $33.
Response:  First, we know that they made $144 per day. Next, we know that they were at the carnival for 22 days. So, to find out how much money they made in total, we can multiply the number of days they were there by the amount they made each day: Total = Number of Days x Daily Income Total = 22 x $144 Total = $3,068
Response:  First, we know that the daily earnings from the ring toss game are $420 - $22 = $408 for 30 days. Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of days played to find out how much was earned per day. So, we have: $408 / 30 = $13.60 per day. Therefore, the daily earnings from the ring toss game were $13.60.
Response:  First, we know that the carnival game earned $382 in its first 44 days. We also know that it earned $374 in the remaining 10 days. To find out how much the carnival game earned overall, we need to add these two amounts together. So, the total amount earned is:  382 + 374 = 756 dollars.
Response:  We know that the carnival earned $120 in its first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days. To find out how much it earned per day during the first 20 days, we need to add up all the earnings for each day:  1st day: $10 2nd day: $10 x 2 = $20 3rd day: $20 x 3 = $60... 20th day: $20 x 20 = $400 Total earnings for the first 20 days: $400 + $66 (remaining 16 days) = $466 So, the daily income of the carnival during the first 20 days was: $466 / 20 days = $23.30 per day.
Response:  First, we know that the carnival made $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days.  To find out how much they made per day during the last 57 days, we need to add up the amount they made each day:  325 + 114 = 439 Total amount earned in 211 days (154 + 57) = 439 / 211 = approximately $2.08 per day During the last 57 days, the carnival made approximately $2.08 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes. Next, we need to find out how many packets of each item she bought in total. For cookies, she bought 10 x 2 = 20 packets, and for cakes, she bought 4 x 2 = 8 packets. Therefore, Lucy bought 20 + 8 = 28 packets in total.
Response:  First, we know that Lucy bought cookie packs for 4 times. Next, she bought cake packs for 22 times. Finally, she bought chocolate packs for 16 times. To find out how many packets of food items Lucy bought in total, we can add up all these numbers:  4 + 22 + 16 = 42 So, Lucy bought 42 packets of food items in total.
Response:  Lucy bought cookie packs and cake packs. We know that she bought 23 cookie packs and some cake packs. To find out how many cake packs she bought, we can subtract the number of cookie packs from the total number of food item packs she had. Total number of food item packs = Number of cookie packs + Number of cake packs Total number of food item packs = 23 + x (where x is the number of cake packs) So, we can set up an equation: 23 + x = 27 Solving for x, we get: x = 4 Therefore, Lucy bought 4 cake packs in addition to the 23 cookie packs.
Response:  First, Lucy bought cookies in packs of 2, so she bought 2 x 2 = 4 packets of cookies. Next, she bought cakes in packs of 12, so she bought 12 x 1 = 12 packets of cakes. In total, Lucy bought 4 + 12 = 16 packets of food items. Therefore, there were 56 - 16 = 40 packets of food left over.
Response:  First, there were 12 people on the bus. Then, 4 more people boarded the bus at the next stop. So, in total, how many people are currently on the bus?  12 + 4 = 16 people are currently on the bus.
Response:  First, there were 8 people on the bus. Next, 12 more people boarded the bus, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people on the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, so now there are 20 - 3 = 17 people left on the bus. Therefore, there are currently 17 people on the bus.
Response:  First, there were 4 people who boarded the bus initially. Then, 9 more people got on at the next stop. So, in total, 4 + 9 = 13 people have boarded the bus so far. Therefore, there are currently 13 people on the bus.
Response:  First, we know that 8 people got on the train, so the number of people on the train now is:  8 + 11 = 19  Therefore, there are currently 19 people on the train.
Response:  First, we know that there were 22 protectors in the program.  Next, we know that the total number of people involved was 676.  So, if we subtract the number of protectors from the total number of people, we can find out how many students were in the program.  676 - 22 =?  Yes, that's right! There were 654 students in the program.
Response:  First, we know that there are 73 parents, so we can add them to our total count of people.  73 + 724 (students) + 744 (teachers) =? Total number of people in the program: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1541  Therefore, there were 1541 people in the program.
Response:  First, we know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in the program. Next, we need to find out how many of the students were not parents. To do this, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 174 from 521, we get:  521 - 174 = 347  Therefore, there were 347 students who were not parents.
Response:  First, we know that there are 61 parents and 177 students in total.  Next, we know that the program has 44 seats available. So, if we want to find out how many people participated in the program, we need to subtract the number of seats from the total number of people.  61 + 177 = 238 (total number of people) 238 - 44 = 194 (number of people who participated in the program) Therefore, 194 people participated in the program.
Response:  First, we know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet (280 meters). Second, we are told that they need to move 1307 feet (400 meters) to reach the end of the cave. So, if we subtract the depth from the total distance, we get:  1307 - 919 = 388 feet (118 meters) This means that the distance to the end of the cave from the starting point is 388 feet or approximately 118 meters.
Response:  First, we know that they have already traveled 849 feet into the cave. Second, we are given that they are moving at a speed of 17 feet per minute. Third, we need to find out how much farther they need to go to reach the end of the cave. To do this, we subtract the distance they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave: Total distance = Depth of cave - Distance traveled So, Total distance = 1218 - 849 = 369 feet They still need to travel 369 feet to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  First, we know that the depth of the cave is 762 feet.  We also know that they are already at 659 feet deep. So, to reach the end of the cave, they need to go up 83 feet (762 - 659).   Therefore, there are 83 feet left to explore.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 8 goldfish in the pond. Secondly, we are told that 6 goldfish remain after the wild cats have eaten some of them. Finally, we want to find out how many goldfish disappeared or were eaten by the wild cats. To do this, we subtract the number of remaining goldfish (6) from the initial number of goldfish (8): 8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, two goldfish disappeared or were eaten by the wild cats.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 7 goldfish and 12 carp in the pond.  Secondly, we are told that wild cats ate some of them. Finally, we know that only 15 fish remain. So, let's subtract the number of fish that remained (15) from the total initial number of fish (7 + 12 = 19):  19 - 15 = 4. Therefore, 4 fish have disappeared.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. Secondly, we are told that wild cats ate some of them, but we don't know how many. Finally, we are given that only two fish remain. So let's start with the equation:  16 + 71 = x + y Where x is the number of remaining goldfish and y is the number of remaining catfish. We can substitute the values we know into this equation:  16 + 71 = 2 + y Now solve for y:  87 = 2 + y Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:  85 = y Therefore, there were 85 catfish left after the wild cats finished eating. To find out how many goldfish remained, subtract the number of catfish from the total initial number of fish:  16 + 71 - 85 = 0 Goldfish remaining: 16 - 85 = -79 There were 79 fewer goldfish than catfish. Since there are only two goldfish remaining, we can conclude that 79 goldfish were eaten by wild cats.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 15 goldfish in the pond. Secondly, we are told that 5 of them were eaten by wild cats. Therefore, to find out how many goldfish remain, we can subtract 5 from 15: 15 - 5 = 10. So, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond after the wild cats have eaten some of them.
"Response:  First, we know that the chef had 43 raspberries at first and used some of them to make a pie. We are told that he left 2 raspberries after making the pie. So, let's subtract the number of raspberries used in the pie from the total number of raspberries he had:  43 - x = 2 Where ""x"" is the number of raspberries used in the pie. Now solve for ""x"":  43 - x = 2  43 - 2 = 0  41 = 0 This means that the chef used 41 raspberries to make the pie, leaving him with 2 raspberries."
Response:  First, we know that Shef had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make pies. So, how many apples are left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples:  58 - 35 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 23 apples left over after making pies.
Response:  First, we know that Shef had 40 raspberries and 54 blueberries in total. After making the pie, he was left with 39 berries of both kinds combined. So, let's start by adding up how many of each type of berry he used to make the pie:  🥝 Raspberries: 40 - 39 = 1 🥝 Blueberries: 54 - 39 = 15 Now we add up the number of each type of berry he used:  1 + 15 = 16 berries in total. Therefore, Shef used 16 berries to make the pie!
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam has 11 action figures and there are four shelves in his room. So, if we divide 11 by 4, we get 2 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, Adam can store 2 complete sets of action figures on his shelves, plus 3 additional action figures left over. In total, he can store 2 x 4 = 8 action figures on his shelves + 3 = 11 action figures.  
So, the answer is 11."
"Response:  Adam has 10 action figures and his room can hold 8 of them. So, he needs an additional space to store the remaining 2 action figures. Since each shelf can hold 8 action figures, we need at least 2 shelves to store all the action figures. Therefore, there are 2 shelves in Adam's room.  

Question: What is the total number of shelves in Adam's room?  Answer: Based on our previous calculation, there are 2 shelves in Adam's room."
Response:  Adam has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold 8 action figures. So, in total, he has 4 x 8 = 32 spaces for action figures. Additionally, he has one shelf that can hold 10 cabinets, so he has 10 more spaces for storing items. Therefore, Adam can store a total of 32 + 10 = 42 items in his room.
Response:  First, we know that there are 544 pots in total.  Next, each pot contains 32 flowers, so...  544 x 32 =...  Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers.  We get...  17088!  There are 17088 flowers in all.
Response:  First, we know that each vase has 53 flowers and 181 sticks. So let's start with the total number of flowers: 53 x 466 = 24,978 flowers. Next, let's calculate the total number of sticks: 181 x 466 = 83,096 sticks. Therefore, the total number of flowers and sticks is 24,978 + 83,096 = 108,074.
Response:  First, we know that each vase has 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So, if we multiply the number of vases (141) by the total number of flowers per vase (71), we get: Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 10,011 flowers.
Response:  First, we know that each vase has 40 flowers, so if there are 400 flowers in total, then there must be...?
Response:  First, we know that there are in total 4502 skittles and 4276 erasers. Next, we need to divide them into groups of size 154. To do this, we can use division.  4502 / 154 =? This gives us the number of groups of size 154 that we can make with all the skittles and erasers.  So, the answer is:  There are approximately 29 (4502 / 154) groups of size 154 that can be made with all the skittles and erasers.
Response:  First, we know that Steven has a total of 3941 skittles and 4950 erasers. Next, we are told that the erasers are divided into groups of 495 each. So, we can start by dividing 4950 by 495 to find out how many groups there are:  4950 / 495 = 10 Now we know that there are 10 groups of erasers. Finally, we need to find out how many skittles Steven has per group of erasers. To do this, we can divide 3941 by 10 (the number of groups of erasers):  3941 / 10 = 394 This means that Steven has 394 skittles in each group of erasers.
Response:  First, we know that there are in total 896 skittles and 517 erasers. So if we divide the number of skittles into groups of 90 (the number of erasers), we get:  896 / 90 = 10 groups + some left over. Since there are 90 erasers per group, each group will have:  90 x 10 = 900 skittles + some left over. Now, let's check how many skittles are leftover:  896 - 900 = 6 leftover skittles. Therefore, there will be 10 groups of 90 skittles each, plus 6 leftover skittles.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each grade has 5 students. So we can start by finding out how many grades there are.   Grade = Total Students / Number of Students per Grade  Grade = 270 / 5  Grade = 54  Therefore, there are 54 grades in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 304 school years in total.  Next, each class has 75 students, so we can multiply 304 by 75 to get the total number of students:  304 x 75 = 22,900  Therefore, there are 22,900 students in the school.
