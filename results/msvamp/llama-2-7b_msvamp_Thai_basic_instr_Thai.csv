  No, the number of pages in a house's legal documents and reading materials does not necessarily increase as the number of rooms increases. The amount of legal documents and reading materials required for a household is determined by various factors such as the size of the household, the type of property, and the location of the property. For example, a small one-room apartment may require fewer legal documents than a large five-bedroom house. Similarly, a rural property may have different requirements than an urban property. Therefore, it is important to consult with a real estate agent or attorney to determine the specific needs of each individual case.

The passage states that ""the student must write a report on three topics related to the field of computer science."" This means that there are three main topics that the student needs to cover in their report.

The first topic is ""computer hardware,"" which covers the physical components of a computer system, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices. According to the passage, this topic should be covered in two pages.

The second topic is ""computer software,"" which refers to the programs and operating systems that run on a computer. This topic should also be covered in two pages.

Finally, the third topic is ""computer networks,"" which deals with the communication between computers and other networked devices. This topic should be covered in one page.

  No, the number of pages in a home economics textbook does not increase by adding more topics. The total number of pages in a home economics textbook is typically around 100-150 pages, regardless of how many topics are covered. This is because the content and layout of the book remain relatively consistent across different editions or versions. However, some publishers may choose to include additional features such as interactive activities, videos, or online resources that can enhance the learning experience for students.
  No, the number of pages in a home economics textbook does not increase as much as the number of pages in a general science or mathematics textbook.

"  The difference between the number of hours a person can hold their breath and the number of minutes they can stay underwater is due to several factors, including lung capacity, muscle strength, and overall physical fitness.

On average, a healthy adult can hold their breath for around 1-2 minutes, depending on the individual's lung capacity and other factors such as air temperature and humidity. However, when it comes to staying underwater, the amount of time a person can remain submerged depends on various factors such as their swimming ability, the depth of the water, and the level of physical exertion involved.

For example, a competitive swimmer may be able to stay underwater for longer periods of time than an average person, while someone who is not a strong swimmer may only be able to stay underwater for shorter intervals. Additionally, the deeper the water, the more difficult it becomes to stay underwater due to the increased pressure on the body.

In summary, while there are some general guidelines for how long a person can hold their breath or stay underwater, these times can vary greatly depending on individual factors and circumstances."
  The answer is 31 + 35 = 66.
  The difference between the time it takes for a nose to heal and the time it takes for a face to heal is due to several factors, including the severity of the injury, the location of the injury, and the individual's overall health.

* Blinking is an involuntary action that occurs every few seconds to help keep the eyes moist and clean, while sneezing is a voluntary action that occurs when the nasal passages or sinuses become irritated.
* People tend to blink more frequently than they sneeze because the eyes are constantly exposed to potential irritants in the environment, such as dust, pollen, and other particles, which can cause the eyes to become dry and irritated more often than the nasal passages become irritated.
* Additionally, people may subconsciously blink more frequently than they sneeze as a way to protect their eyes from foreign objects or debris that could potentially harm them.
* On average, a person blinks about 15-20 times per minute, while they sneeze about once every 15-30 minutes. However, these frequencies can vary greatly depending on individual factors such as age, health status, and environmental conditions."

The answer is not 12 games as suggested by the question, but rather 36 games (20 x 1.8). This is because each player will have played against every other player once, so there are 36 possible pairs of players who can play each other."

  Yes, the additional cost of building a house with more than 80% open space is higher than that of a house with less than 80% open space. The reason for this is that the cost of land and construction materials increases as the percentage of open space in the design decreases. For example, if you have a house design with 86% open space, you will need to use more land and materials to build the structure, which will increase the overall cost. On the other hand, if you have a house design with less than 80% open space, you can save on land and material costs because you don't need as much space for outdoor areas like patios or gardens.

" With its higher strength and improved workability, Type 95 cement can last longer than Type 40 cement under normal conditions. This means that structures built with Type 95 cement may not need to be repaired or replaced as frequently, saving money and resources over the long term.

In summary, while there may be some initial cost savings from using a lower-strength cement like Type 40, the benefits of using a higher-strength cement like Type 95 far outweigh these savings in terms of improved durability, workability, finish, shrinkage, and lifespan."

Therefore, there were 7 trees that grew in the backyard of his house."
"
The question asks about the number of trees that grew after the death of a person, and how many trees died during their lifetime. To calculate this, we need to know the age at which the person passed away, as well as the number of years they lived before passing away. Let's assume the person was 70 years old when they passed away, and they lived for 60 years before that. This means they were alive for a total of 130 years (70 + 60).

Now, let's consider the number of trees that grew during those 130 years. According to the United States Forest Service, an average tree grows at a rate of 1-2 feet per year. So, over the course of 130 years, there would be approximately 130-260 trees (depending on the growth rate) that grew from seedlings or saplings planted during the person's lifetime.

On the other hand, the question also asks about the number of trees that died during the person's lifetime. Unfortunately, there isn't a straightforward way to estimate this without more information. However, it's safe to say that some trees may have died due to natural causes such as disease, insect infestations, or old age. Perhaps around 5-10% of the trees in the area might have died each year, depending on factors like climate, soil quality, and maintenance practices. Therefore, over the course of 60 years, there could potentially be around 30-60 dead trees (assuming a constant mortality rate).

When we subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees that grew during the person's lifetime, we get a net gain of around 100-130 trees (based on the previous estimates). So, the answer to the question is that the number of trees that grew after the person's death is greater than the number of trees that died during their lifetime."

  No, it is not possible to store 80 grams of rice in a bag with a capacity of 16 grams per day. The answer can be found by dividing the total amount of rice (80 grams) by the number of days (16 days).

  Yes, the answer is yes. The number of times the cat grooms itself per day is 44 strokes and it spends more time grooming its fur than not grooming it (25 strokes per day). Therefore, the cat grooms its fur more than 10 times a day.

 12 x 11 = 132 square feet.
  The length of the room is 28 feet.
  The length of the room is 28 feet (7 x 4).
  Yes, the room is large enough for a queen-sized bed. The length of the bed is 16 feet, which is longer than the width of the room (11 feet). Therefore, you will need to use a king-size mattress that is wider than 11 feet in order to fit comfortably in the room without any gaps between the sides of the mattress and the walls of the room.
  The length of the room is 20 feet and the width is 12 feet. If there are 4 tables in the room, each table takes up an area of 3 feet by 3 feet, so the total area of all the tables is 9 square feet. Therefore, the remaining space in the room after placing the tables is 11 square feet (20 - 9 = 11).
"

Area = Length x Width
= 19 x 18
= 342 sq ft"
  The length of the room is 19 feet and the width is 20 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 19 x 20 = 380 square feet.
  The length of the room is 5 feet.
  The length of the room is 20 feet.
"

18 feet x 12 inches/foot = 216 square feet (width)
20 feet x 12 inches/foot = 240 square feet (length)
Total area = width x length = 216 square feet x 240 square feet = 50,720 square feet
So, the girl does not need to use more space than this amount."

  The answer is 93.
  The answer is $2,500.
"

$5,280 - $1,560 = $3,720

Therefore, Razorback made a profit of $3,720 from selling shirts during the Texas Tech game."
  The answer is $4,570.
"

The question asks how much money Razorbacks can earn from selling their jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Let's assume that each jersey costs $100 to produce.

If Razorbacks sell 74 jerseys, they will make $7,400 in revenue ($100 x 74 jerseys).

If they sell 156 jerseys, they will make $15,600 in revenue ($100 x 156 jerseys).

Therefore, the total amount of money Razorbacks can earn from selling their jerseys during the game is $2,380 (($7,400 + $15,600) / 2)."
  The price of a single ticket for the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech is $192, while the price of a single ticket for the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech in football is $34. Therefore, the difference in price between the two games is $158 ($192 - $34).
  No, the answer is not 86 dollars. The correct answer is 254 dollars.
  The seller of the Razorback merchandise is offering a discount of 8 dollars per item and a total discount of 130 dollars for buying 13 items. Therefore, the seller will make a profit of 460 dollars (130 x 3 = 460).
"

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hats x Price per hat
= 20 x $201 + 14 x $14
= $4,284 + $196
= $4,480

So, the seller's total revenue from the sale of these items would be $4,480."
  The answer is 30.
  The average price of a single Razorback jersey is around $70.
"
Razorbacks sold 5 t-shirts at $10 each and 215 hats at $21 each, for a total of $3,780 in revenue."
"

Razorbacks sold 76 dollars of shirts and 204 dollars of hats during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Since each shirt costs 30 dollars and each hat costs 20 dollars, the total revenue from shirts was 76 x 30 = 2,280 dollars, and the total revenue from hats was 204 x 20 = 4,080 dollars. Therefore, the total revenue from both shirts and hats was 2,280 + 4,080 = 6,360 dollars."
  The answer is $5,680.
  The price of the shirts and hoodies sold by Razorback is not directly related to the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. The prices are set by the store based on their own pricing strategy, market conditions, and other factors. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact price difference between the two teams' merchandise solely from this information.
