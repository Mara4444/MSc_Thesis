"Response:  Sure! Let's analyze the information given in the question:

Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the factory.
Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the factory.
So, the total number of balloons that Alan and Jake brought to the factory is:
3 + 5 = 8
The total number of balls that Alan and Jake brought to the factory is:
20 + 59 = 79
Now, let's move on to the part about them going to the park. The question asks how many balloons they had there. Since both Alan and Jake went to the park together, their combined total number of balloons at the park is:
8 (from the factory) +? (from the park) =?
We know that Jake brought 10 more balloons than Alan to the park, so Jake had:
10 + 8 = 18 balloons at the park.
Therefore, the final answer is:
Alan had 8 balloons at the park, and Jake had 18 balloons at the park."

Response:  The daily Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends more time studying Chinese than English by 1 hour (7 - 6 = 1).
Response: 2 hours. Explanation: According to the passage, Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. If he continues this routine for a total of 4 hours per day, then he has spent 2 hours studying Chinese (since 3 + 2 = 5).
Response: 14 hours. Explanation: According to the passage, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and also studies Chinese for several hours. If he were to spend an additional 2 hours studying English instead of Chinese, that means he would have spent a total of 9 hours (7 + 2) studying English. Therefore, the amount of time he spent studying Chinese is 14 hours (9 - 5).
Response: 4 hours. Explanation: If Ryan spends an additional 2 hours learning Chinese to help him learn English, he will have spent a total of 6 hours (5 hours for Chinese + 2 hours for Chinese) on language learning that day. Therefore, he will have 4 hours left over to spend on English (5 hours - 6 hours = 4 hours).
Response: 13 hours (6 hours x 2 days) + 7 hours = 20 hours.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day, so if he studies for 2 days, he will spend a total of 12 hours studying English and 10 hours studying Chinese.
Response: 12 hours (or 720 minutes)
Response:  The daily study time for English and Chinese languages is 4 hours each day, totaling 24 hours per week (Monday to Friday). Therefore, over 86 days, Ryan will have studied English and Chinese for a total of 1976 hours (24 x 86 = 1976).
Response: 18 hours (6 + 7 + 3 = 18)
Response: 10 hours. Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which is equivalent to 10 hours per week (6 x 7). Additionally, he spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese and 58 hours per week studying Spanish, for a total of 24 hours per week (3 x 8) + 58 hours per week = 82 hours per week. Therefore, Ryan invests more time in English than in Chinese or Spanish combined.
Response: 3 hours. Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. If he spends 4 hours studying Spanish, then he spends more time studying Spanish than English by 3 hours (4 - 7 = 3).
Response: 10 hours. Explanation: According to the question, Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese. To find out how much more time he spends studying Spanish than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying languages. Therefore, the answer is 10 hours (5 - 2 = 3).
"Response: 10 hours
Explanation:
Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying English and Chinese. If he studies English for 2 hours every day, he will spend 6 hours (3 x 2) studying Chinese each day. Therefore, Ryan spends 10 hours (6 hours + 4 hours) studying both languages combined."

Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 7 apples on the tree. If Rachel picked one apple, then there are 6 apples left on the tree."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 4 apples on the tree and Rachel took some of them away. Now, there are only 2 apples left on the tree, so Rachel must have taken at least 3 apples (4 - 2 = 3)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there are currently 5 apples remaining on the tree, of which 3 have already been picked and 2 remain unpicked. Therefore, there are 4 unpicked apples left on the tree."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are currently 7 apples remaining on the tree, of which 6 have already been picked and 1 has not yet been picked. Therefore, if all 7 apples were previously picked, then 3 apples must have been left on the tree."
Response:  There are currently 8 apples in the tree (6 + 2).
Response:  There are 29 apples in total (3 ripe + 27 unripe).
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and then 2 new apples grew on the tree. So, there are still 6 apples left on the tree after Rachel picked some. Therefore, the total number of apples that were present on the tree initially is 3 (6 - 7 + 2)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, when Rachel picked an apple from the tree, two apples grew in its place. Then, three new apples grew on the same tree. Therefore, there are currently five apples on the tree (the original two plus the three new ones)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel picked two apples from the tree and there are now seven apples left on the tree. To find out how many apples were originally on the tree, we can use the information that Rachel picked two apples. If she had picked three apples, there would be five apples left on the tree (since she picked two). Similarly, if she had picked four apples, there would be six apples left on the tree (since she picked two). Therefore, since she picked two apples, there must have been 30 apples on the tree initially."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel picked 8 apples from each of the 3 apple trees, leaving 1 apple in each tree. Therefore, there were initially 5 apples (3 trees x 5 apples per tree = 15 apples)."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, Rachel picked 7 apples from each of the 3 trees, resulting in a total of 21 apples (7 x 3 = 21). Since there were originally 29 apples on the tree, and Rachel took 21, that means she left 8 apples behind (29 - 21 = 8). Therefore, Rachel picked 13 apples in total (8 + 5 = 13)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had more marbles than Doug before they played in the park. After losing some of his marbles in the park, Ed now has 4 more marbles than Doug."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Edgar has 45 marbles and lost 11 of them at the park. So Edgar now has 34 marbles left (45 - 11 = 34). Since Doug had more marbles than Edgar before they played together, if Edgar has 34 marbles left after losing some at the park, then Doug must have had more than 34 marbles originally. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles Doug had and the number of marbles Edgar had is 36 (Doug's original number of marbles - Edgar's original number of marbles)."

Response:  The distance between the frog and the turtle was 3 inches (9 cm) more than the distance between the frog and the mouse. So, the distance between the frog and the turtle was 15 inches (38 cm).
Response:  The length of the snail's track was 31 inches, and the frog's jump was 35 inches. So, the total distance traveled by both animals together is 66 inches (31 + 35).
"Response: 28 inches
Explanation: According to the passage, the frog jumped 36 inches and the mouse was 17 inches farther away from the frog than the frog's jump distance. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the mouse is 36 - 17 = 19 inches."
Response:  The distance that the mouse ran was 37 inches (approximately 94 cm).
"Response: 30 inches
Explanation: According to the passage, the crab ran 19 inches and the frog 10 inches further than the crab. The mouse also ran 20 inches further than the frog. Therefore, the distance that the mouse ran is 30 inches (20 + 10 = 30)."
"Response: 56 inches
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The crab ran 19 inches.
* The frog jumped 39 inches further than the crab.
* The mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog.

So, if the frog jumped 39 inches further than the crab, and the crab jumped 19 inches, then the distance traveled by the frog is equal to the sum of its own jump plus the distance traveled by the crab:

Frog's distance = Frog's jump + Crab's distance
= 39 + 19
= 58 inches

Since the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the difference between the frog's distance and the frog's jump:

Mouse's distance = Frog's distance - Frog's jump
= 58 - 39
= 19 inches

Therefore, the crab ran 19 inches, the frog jumped 58 inches, and the mouse jumped 19 inches."

Response:  The grasshopper jumped 39 inches (approximately 39 inches).  Therefore, the frog jumped 41 inches minus 39 inches = 2 inches farther than the grasshopper.
"Response: 25 inches
Explanation: According to the passage, the crab ran 19 inches and the frog 4 inches more than the crab. Therefore, the frog ran 23 inches (19 + 4). The passage also states that the mouse ran 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse ran 25 inches (23 - 44)."
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches and the mouse jumped 27 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog.
Response:  The distance that the crab and frog ran was 21 inches for the crab and 16 inches for the frog. Therefore, the difference in distance between the crab and frog is 5 inches (21 - 16 = 5).

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Mary needs 6 jars of sugar and 13 jars of flour to make cake. Since she has already added 8 jars of flour, she needs an additional 5 jars of flour (13 - 8 = 5)."
Response:  Yes, you need to add more sugar than flour. According to the recipe, you should use 11 tablespoons of flour and 8 tablespoons of sugar. So, you need to add 3 more tablespoons of sugar.
Response:  Yes, you need to add more flour. If you have already added 3 tablespoons of flour and the recipe calls for 6 tablespoons, then you need to add an additional 3 tablespoons of flour.
Response:  If she wants to add more flour than what is already added (2 cups), then she would need an additional 8 cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10).
Response:  To make 1 cup of cake mix according to the recipe, you will need an additional 4 tablespoons (tbsp) of flour and 10 tbsp of sugar beyond what is already provided in the ingredients. Therefore, you will need a total of 13 tbsp of flour and 72 tbsp of sugar to make 1 cup of cake mix.
Response:  To find out how much more sugar to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar already added (10 + 2 = 12) from the total amount of sugar required (14). Therefore, you need to add an additional 2 tablespoons of sugar (14 - 12 = 2).
"Response:  To find out how much more flour is needed to make an additional cup of cake mix, we need to subtract the amount of flour already used (11 cups) from the total amount of flour required (12 cups). Therefore, the answer is:

Additional flour needed = Total flour required - Flour already used = 12 cups - 11 cups = 1 cup

So, one additional cup of cake mix will require an additional 1 cup of flour."
Response:  The recipe calls for 10 jars of flour and 2 jars of sugar, so you will need an additional 5 jars of flour (7 - 10 = 5).
"Response: 3 cups  
Explanation: According to the recipe, if you add more flour than salt, you will need an additional 3 cups of flour for every cup of salt added. So in this case, since the recipe calls for 7 tablespoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of flour, you would need 3 x 7 = 21 cups of flour."
Response:  To make 6 cups of cake mix with the given ingredients, you will need to add an additional 14 teaspoons (or 3/4 cup) of sugar beyond what is already listed in the recipe.
Response:  To make the cake according to the recipe, you need to add 13 tablespoons of sugar (not 2 tablespoons as mentioned in the question). Therefore, if you have already added 2 tablespoons of sugar, you would need to add an additional 11 tablespoons of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response: 3 cups  
Explanation: According to the recipe, Mary needs to add 9 tablespoons of flour and 6 tablespoons of sugar. Since she has already added 4 tablespoons of sugar, she needs to add an additional 5 tablespoons of flour (3 cups) to make the cake batter."
"Response: 3 cups  
Explanation: According to the question, Mary wants to make a cake that requires 6 jars of sugar and 9 jars of flour. She has already added 2 jars of flour, so she needs an additional 3 jars of flour to complete the recipe."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the recipe, you need 5 more tablespoons of flour than sugar to make the cake batter."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the recipe, 13 cups of flour are needed, but the person has already added 12 cups. Therefore, an additional 1 cup of flour is required."
Response:  To make 6 cups of cake mix using 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar, you will need an additional 32 cups of flour (since 7 + 6 = 13). Therefore, you will need a total of 39 cups of flour to make 6 cups of cake mix.
Response:  To find out how much more sugar to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar already added (10+12=22) from the total amount of sugar required (31). Therefore, an additional 9 tablespoons of sugar are needed.
Response:  To make more than 6 cups of cake mix, you will need to add more flour. Specifically, for every additional cup of cake mix you want to make, you will need an additional 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour. So, if you want to make 9 cups of cake mix, you would need 7 1/4 cups of flour (9 - 6 = 3 + 2 1/4 = 7 1/4).
Response: 28 cups (or more) of flour are needed to make 9 jars of cake mix with the given ingredients and proportions.
"Response: 3 cups  
Explanation: According to the recipe provided in the question, there are 2 cups of flour already added. To determine how much more flour is needed, we need to subtract the amount of flour already used (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required (9 cups). Therefore, an additional 7 cups of flour are needed."
Response:  To find out how much more sugar to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar already added (11 + 6 = 17) from the total amount of sugar required (12). Therefore, an additional 5 teaspoons of sugar should be added.
Response: 3/4 cup (or 68g) more sugar is needed to make 7 cups of cake according to the recipe.
"Response: 3 cups  
Explanation: According to the recipe, Mary needs to mix 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour to make the cake. Since she has already mixed 10 jars of sugar (which is equal to 1 cup), she still needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour to meet the total amount required by the recipe."

"Response: 50 (or 42 + 9)
Explanation: According to the passage, 42 birds migrated from Africa and 31 birds migrated from Asia. Therefore, the total number of birds that migrated from both continents is 42 + 31 = 73. Since there are 8 birds living near the mountain, this means that 73 / 8 = 9 birds remained in Africa after migration. So, the number of birds that migrated to Africa is 9."
"Response: 56 (or 94 - 47)
Explanation:
The passage states that 47 birds migrated from Africa to Asia and 94 birds migrated from Africa to Asia. Therefore, if we subtract the number of birds that migrated from Africa to Asia from the total number of birds, we get 56 (or 94 - 47)."

Explanation:
The given information can be summarized as follows:

* 18 birds are living near the mountain.
* 38 birds flew to Africa.

"Response: 34
Explanation:
According to the passage, 27 families of birds migrated from their winter home to the mountain area where they gave birth to their young. If there were 41 families of birds living in the mountain area before migration, then after migration, there would be 34 families left (41 - 27 = 34)."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
According to the passage, 86 birds migrated from their winter home to escape the cold weather. If 45 of these birds are staying in the mountainous area where they live, then the remaining 41 birds must have migrated elsewhere for warmer climates."

Explanation: According to the question, Polo received 589 pens as birthday gifts from his friends and gave away 571 pens to them during their school year together. This means that he had 161 pens left after giving away all the pens he received. To find out how many more pens he gave away than what he received, we subtract the number of pens he received (589) from the number of pens he gave away (571): 589 - 571 = 308. Therefore, Polo gave away 308 more pens than what he received."
"Response: 356
Explanation:
According to the question, Poll received 110 pens as a birthday gift and gave away 90 pens to his friends during their school year together. This means that he had 220 pens left (110 - 90 = 220).

"Response: 106
Explanation: According to the question, Jeff gave Nelly 136 cards out of the total 242 cards in his collection. Therefore, Nelly had 106 cards left after receiving them from Jeff."
Response: 246 (First, Jeff had 301 cards and now he has 154 cards left, so initially he had 246 cards)
"Response: 136
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Nelly has 528 cards.
* Jeff has 11 cards.
* After giving some cards to Jeff, Nelly has 252 cards left.

Now, let's find out how many cards Nelly gave to Jeff:

Number of cards Nelly gave to Jeff = Number of cards Jeff had initially - Number of cards he already had
= 11 - (528 - 252)
= 11 - 276
= -265

Since it is not possible to give negative cards, we can conclude that Nelly did not give any cards to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards Nelly gave to Jeff is 0."
"Response: 191
Explanation: According to the passage, Nelly had 566 baseball cards and Jeff had 234 cards. When Jeff was given some of Nelly's cards, there were 535 cards left in total (566 - 234 = 535). Therefore, Jeff now has 191 cards (535 - 234 = 191)."
Response:  Nelson has 309 baseball cards and gave 415 - 309 = 166 to Jeff. So, Nelson has 166 more baseball cards than Jeff.
"Response: 38
Explanation: According to the question, Nelly had 246 baseball cards and Jeff gave her 10 more cards. Therefore, Nelly now has 356 cards (246 + 10). Since there are only 10 cards in total that Nelly has that are not baseball cards, the number of baseball cards left with Jeff is 404 - 10 = 394."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Nelly gave Jeff 195 cards and took 115 cards from him. Therefore, the number of cards that Nelly gave to Jeff is 195, and the number of cards that she took from him is 115. So, the difference between the two numbers is 80 (195 - 115). Since Jeff has 210 cards in total, Nelly gave him 40 more cards than he had initially."
Response:  Nelson has 178 baseball cards and 55 ten-card sets. Therefore, he has 178 - 55 = 123 more baseball cards than Jeffrey.
Response:  Yes, Nelly has more than 10 baseball cards among the 376 cards she left for Jeff. The number of baseball cards Nelly has is 111, which is greater than 10.

"Response: 13
Explanation:
The question states that Paco ate 40 cookies and then ate another 2. This means he ate a total of 42 cookies. Then, it is stated that 37 more cookies were added to the pile. Therefore, the number of cookies left after Paco ate them all is 13 (42 - 37 = 13)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Paco ate 25 cookies and then ate 5 more. Therefore, he ate a total of 30 cookies (25 + 5)."

The given information can be represented as follows:
Paco ate 13 cookies and then he ate 2 more. So, the total number of cookies Paco ate is 13 + 2 = 15.
Now, we are asked how many more cookies Paco ate than there were originally. To find this, we subtract the number of cookies Paco ate from the original number of cookies: 36 - 15 = 21.
Therefore, Paco ate 21 more cookies than there were originally."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
If Pako ate 40 cookies and gave away 13, then he has 40 - 13 = 27 cookies left."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
The original number of cookies that Paco had was 17. After eating some, he had 14 left. He then gave 13 to his friend. So, the difference between the number of cookies Paco had after eating some and the number of cookies he gave away is 14 - 13 = 1. Therefore, Paco's friend received 1 more cookie than Paco had after eating some."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
The total number of cookies eaten by Paco is 12 + 16 = 28. Since he gave more than half (50%) of them to his friend, he has 28 / 2 = 14 cookies left for himself. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies given to the friend and the number of cookies left for Paco is 14 - 9 = 5. So, the answer is 9."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

Paco ate 37 sweet cookies and 11 salted cookies.
He then ate 5 more sweet cookies and 2 more salted cookies.
Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet cookies Paco ate and the number of salted cookies he ate is 36 (37 - 11 = 26)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, Paco ate 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. Later, he ate 20 more sweet cookies and 34 more salty cookies. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet cookies Paco ate initially (8) and the total number of sweet cookies he ate later (20) is 12. Similarly, the difference between the number of salty cookies Paco ate initially (6) and the total number of salty cookies he ate later (34) is 28. So, the answer is 16."

Answer: 22 cookies (36 - 14 = 22)"
"Response: 23
Explanation:
Paco ate 41 cookies and gave 9 each to his friends. So he had 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left.
He then ate 18 more cookies and gave 18 each to his friends. So he had 32 + 18 = 50 cookies left after eating the second batch of cookies.
Therefore, Paco ate 50 - 32 = 18 more cookies than his friends."
"Response: 17
Explanation:
The total number of cookies that Paco gave to his friend is 6 + 30 = 36.
Since Paco ate 23 cookies himself, he has 36 - 23 = 13 more cookies than his friend. Therefore, the answer is 17."
Response:  The number of sweet cookies that Pakco ate is 15 + 56 = 71.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Pako ate 26 salty cookies and 17 sweet cookies. After eating them, he had 14 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies left. Therefore, the number of salty cookies that Pako left was 5 (9 - 14 = 5)."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the question, Paco ate 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. Later, he ate 23 more salty cookies and 32 more sweet cookies. Therefore, Paco ate a total of 17 more sweet cookies than salty cookies (32 - 6 = 26)."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, Paco ate 40 chocolate cookies and 25 salted cookies. Later, he ate 28 salted cookies and 15 chocolate cookies. To find out how many more salted cookies Paco ate than chocolate cookies, we subtract the number of chocolate cookies he ate later from the total number of salted cookies he ate: 28 - 15 = 13.

"Response: 22 pounds (or 10 kg)

Explanation:
According to the question, Marco's father brought back 35 pounds of strawberries from their trip to the farm. Then, Marco said that his own strawberries were only 13 pounds. So, we can calculate the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his father's as follows:

35 pounds - 13 pounds = 22 pounds (or 10 kg)

Therefore, Marco's father's strawberries are 22 pounds heavier than Marco's."

Explanation:
According to the passage, Marco's father and he gathered 36 pounds of strawberries (or 16.8 kg). When they returned home, Marco's father gave him 2 pounds (or 0.9 kg) of strawberries, so Marco now has 4 pounds (or 1.8 kg) of strawberries. Therefore, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 30 pounds or 13.6 kg."
"Response: 34 + 3 = 37
Explanation:
Marco's dad collected 22 pounds of strawberries and Marco found an additional 30 pounds when he returned home. Therefore, Marco's total weight of strawberries is 36 pounds (22 + 30) and his dad's total weight of strawberries is 37 pounds (including the additional 30 pounds Marco found)."
Response: 24 pounds (or 10.89 kg)
"Response: 
The weight of Marco's strawberries is $30$, and the total weight of his father's strawberries is $17$. Therefore, the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his father's strawberries is:

$30 - 17 = 13$ pounds

So Marco's strawberries are $13$ pounds heavier than his father's strawberries."
"Response: 5 pounds (or 2.3 kg)

Explanation:
According to the question, Marco's dad bought 26 pounds of strawberries and Marco's share was 10 pounds. Therefore, if all of Marco's dad's strawberries were 26 pounds, then Marco's share would be 26 - 10 = 16 pounds (or 7.3 kg) more than his dad's share."
Response:  If Marco's dad bought 11 pounds of strawberries and they cost $30 per pound, then the total cost of Marco's dad's strawberries is $330 ($30 x 11).

So, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on is 4 - (-1) = 5."
"Response: 82
Explanation: If Baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than 51/133 = 0.40 (or 40%) additional cakes beyond what he sold. Therefore, the number of extra cakes Baker made is 133 - 51 = 82."
"Response: 26
Explanation: If Baker made 54 cakes and sold 19 of them, then he has 35 cakes left (54 - 19 = 35). Since he still has 13 cakes left after selling 19, he must have sold 26 cakes in total (13 + 26 = 39)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: If Baker sold 145 cakes and there are 72 left, then Baker must have made 73 cakes (145 - 72 = 73)."
"Response: 15 - 14 = 1
So Baker has 1 more piece of cake than his friend gave him."
Response:  The baker has 36 cakes left (121 - 105 = 36).
"Response: 67
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 13 cakes and sold them for $91. Then, he made and sold an additional 154 cakes, which is more than the number of cakes he sold previously. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes sold before and after is 67 (154 - 91)."
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. This means that he had 92 cakes left over (170 - 78 = 92). Therefore, there were 42 more cakes left over than he sold."
Response:  The baker has 185 cakes (110 + 75 + 76).
Response:  The baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them, leaving him with 73 remaining cakes. Then, he made an additional 111 cakes, bringing his total number of cakes to 284. So, compared to the number of cakes that were sold, the baker made 109 more cakes (284 - 175).
"Response: 50
Explanation: If Baker made 149 cakes and sold 10 of them, he has 139 cakes left (149 - 10 = 139). If he then sold 90 more cakes, he would have 49 cakes left (139 - 90 = 49)."
"Response: 96
Explanation: If Baker made 15 cakes and sold them for $20 each, he would have earned $300 ($20 x 15 = $300). If he also made 103 pastries and sold them for $10 each, he would have earned an additional $103 ($10 x 103 = $1030). Therefore, in total, Baker would have earned $1330 ($300 + $1030 = $1330)."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 126 cakes and sold 115 of them. Therefore, the number of cakes that Baker made is 126 - 115 = 11. Similarly, Baker made 48 pies and sold 81 of them, so the number of pies that Baker made is 48 - 81 = -33. Since the number of cakes is greater than the number of pies by 11 - (-33) = 44, we can conclude that Baker made more cakes than pies."
"Response: 

Let's assume that Baker made $x$ cakes and $y$ faces of pastry. If he sold all of them, then the number of faces of pastry he sold is equal to $y - x$.

We know that Baker sold 19 cakes and 131 faces of pastry, so we can write the equation:

$$y = 19 + (131 - x)$$

Now, we want to find out how many more faces of pastry were sold than cakes. To do this, we subtract the number of cakes from the total number of faces of pastry:

$$\text{Number of extra faces of pastry} = y - (19 + x)$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\text{Number of extra faces of pastry} = 131 - 22 = 109$$

Therefore, there are $109$ more faces of pastry than cakes."
Response:  The baker sold $158 worth of cakes and $147 worth of pastries, so the baker sold $11 more worth of cakes than pastries.

Explanation: If Baker had sold 44 cakes and made 48 more if he had made them, then there would be 12 cakes left over (48 - 44 = 12)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: If Baker had initially made 40 cakes and sold 8 of them, then he must have made 32 more cakes (40 - 8 = 32). So, if he had made 40 cakes in total, he would have sold 16 more than that amount (32 + 16 = 48)."
Response:  If the baker's friend had initially made 169 pieces of cake, and then he gave 137 pieces to the baker, there would be 32 pieces of cake left over (169 - 137 = 32).
"Response: 94
Explanation:
The total number of cakes made by Baker is 173 + 103 = 276.
Since Baker sold 86 cakes, he has 276 - 86 = 190 cakes left with him.
Therefore, Baker has 94 cakes left."
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 99 cakes and sold 89 of them. So, he had 10 more cakes than he sold (99 - 89 = 10). Therefore, the number of additional cakes is 42 (10 + 32 = 42)."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the passage, Baker made 8 cakes and sold 139 more. Therefore, the total number of cakes he sold is 139 + 8 = 147. Since he had 145 cakes left over after selling them all, there are 6 more cakes that he had than he sold."
Response:  The baker has 375 cakes (62 + 149 = 375).
"Response: 

The baker made 81 cakes and sold 46 of them, so he had 35 extra cakes left over (81 - 46 = 35)."
"Response: 93
Explanation: If Baker made 108 cakes and sold them all, he would have 108 - 44 = 64 cakes left."
Response:  The baker has 37 more pies than cakes. Therefore, the baker has 56 - 37 = 19 more pies than cakes.
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, Baker made 52 pies and 84 cakes. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pies, then he sold 32 more cakes than pies."
"Response: 56 (or 56/92)

Explanation:
If Baker made 134 pies and 11 cakes, and he sold all of them, then he had a total of 134 + 11 = 145 items for sale. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pies, then he had 145 - 140 = 15 more pies than cakes left unsold. Therefore, there were 15 + 11 = 26 more pies than cakes left unsold by Baker."
Response:  The baker sold 126 more cakes than faces. Therefore, if he sold 8 faces and 97 cakes, he sold 126 + 8 = 134 cakes more than faces.
Response:  The baker sold 78 pieces of cake and 154 pieces of pastry. Therefore, the baker sold 78 + 154 = 232 pieces of pastry, which is more than the number of cakes (78) sold.

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Kelsi has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. If she sells 12 Nintendo games, then she will have 8 remaining (20 - 12 = 8)."
"Response: 57
Explanation: To find out how many Sony games Keeli needs to drop in order to have 31 Sony games left after buying 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games, we need to subtract the number of Sony games she already has (46) from the total number of Sony games she wants to own (132). This gives us 86, which is then divided by the number of Sony games she already has (46) to get 1.79 or rounded up to 2. Therefore, Keeli needs to drop 2 Sony games to have 31 Sony games left after buying 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Keely has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 more after searching. To find 6 more games that she can keep, she needs to give up 25 games (80 - 31 = 25)."

Explanation: According to the problem statement, Randi has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he has 72 blocks left after building the tower, then he must have used 36 blocks to build it."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Randi has 79 blocks and uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. Therefore, there are 66 blocks left over (79 - 14 - 11 = 66)."
Response:  The person uses 27 blocks to build the tower and 53 blocks to build the house, so they use a total of 80 blocks (27 + 53) to build both structures.
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Randi uses 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the tower than for building the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower. In this case, 33 - 13 = 20, so Randi used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
Randy has 86 blocks and uses 79 of them to build a tower. He then uses 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks Randy used to build the house than he did for the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks Randy had: 86 - 79 = 8. Therefore, Randy used 8 more blocks to build the house than he did for the tower."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, Randi uses 36 blocks to build a tower. If there are 59 blocks in total, then Randi used 36 / 59 = 13 blocks less than the total number of blocks available."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Randi used 95 blocks to build his house and 50 blocks to build his tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for the tower than for the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used by Randi: 95 - 50 = 45. Therefore, Randi used 45 more blocks to build his tower than he did for his house."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the question, Randi used 89 blocks for his house and 63 blocks for his tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for the tower than for the house, we subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used by Randi: 89 - 63 = 26. Therefore, Randi used 26 more blocks for his tower than for his house."

"Response: 1390
Explanation:
The farmer harvested 66 baskets of oranges per day, and each basket contains 25 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested in 87 days is:
66 x 25 = 1650
So, there are 1390 oranges left after 87 days (1650 - 165)."
"Response: 240
Explanation: If each bag contains 35 oranges and they harvest 8 bags per day, then the total number of oranges harvested per day is 8 x 35 = 280 oranges."
"Response: 4320 oranges.
Explanation:
The farmer harvests 80 baskets of oranges per day, and each basket contains 57 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested per day is 80 x 57 = 4320 oranges."
Response: 35 x 12 = 420 oranges.
"Response: 3680 (or 3680 kg)
Explanation:
The farmer harvested 74 baskets of oranges per day and threw away 71 baskets. Therefore, he harvested a total of 74 x 51 = 3680 baskets over 51 days. Since each basket contains approximately 30-40 oranges, the total weight of the oranges harvested is approximately 3680 x 30 = 10940 kg (or 10940 lb)."
"Response: 3840 oranges/day
Explanation:
If one bag of oranges contains 50 oranges and they produce 76 bags per day, then the total number of oranges produced per day is:
76 x 50 = 3840 oranges/day"

Response: 82 + 61 = 143 bags of oranges.
"Response: 70
Explanation:
The passage states that he picked 31 baskets of oranges that were fully ripe and 24 baskets that were not yet ripe. If we assume that each basket contains approximately 40-50 oranges (a rough estimate), then the total number of oranges picked would be:
31 x 40 = 1240 oranges
+ 24 x 40 = 960 oranges
Total number of oranges picked = 2200 oranges
Therefore, over a period of 45 days, he picked around 2200 oranges."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the passage, the farmer harvested 44 baskets of oranges that were fully ripe and 25 baskets of unripe oranges in one day. Therefore, the difference between the number of baskets of fully ripe oranges and the number of baskets of unripe oranges is 44 - 25 = 19. So, the farmer harvested 19 more baskets of fully ripe oranges than unripe oranges in one day."
"Response: 108
Explanation: According to the passage, the farmer harvests 5 baskets of oranges that are fully ripe and 74 baskets of unripened oranges per day. Therefore, if we assume that each basket contains 30 oranges (a common size for a basket), then the total number of oranges harvested per day is:

5 x 30 = 150 fully ripe oranges
74 x 30 = 2220 unripened oranges
So, in one day, the farmer harvests more than 108 oranges (150 + 2220)."
Response: 18 days.
"Response: 39
Explanation: If they harvested 56 oranges in total and worked for 14 days, then they harvested an average of 39 oranges per day."
"Response: 100
Explanation: According to the passage, the farmer harvested 25 baskets of immature oranges and 5 baskets of mature oranges per day. Since the farmer worked for 73 days, the total number of oranges he harvested is:

25 x 73 = 1825 (immature oranges) + 5 x 73 = 365 (mature oranges) = 2190 oranges
Therefore, there are 2190 oranges left after 73 days of harvesting."
"Response: 109 
Explanation: The farmer harvested 65 baskets of immature oranges and 46 baskets of mature oranges in one day. If he continues to harvest at this rate for 6 days, he will have collected a total of 109 baskets of oranges."

Explanation: According to the passage, the farmer harvested 41 baskets of immature oranges and 86 baskets of mature oranges in one day. Therefore, the difference between the number of baskets harvested by the mature oranges (86) and the number of baskets harvested by the immature oranges (41) is 45."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, 71 baskets of immature oranges were harvested and 60 baskets of mature oranges were found. Therefore, there are 31 more mature oranges than immature oranges (71 - 60 = 31)."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. Therefore, the length of her room is greater than its width by 1 foot (12 - 11 = 1).
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is 5 feet. If she needs a carpet that is 14 square feet in size, then the width of her room is 28 inches.
Response: 20 feet. Explanation: If Ji-seo's room is 7 feet wide and she needs a 14 square foot carpet, then the length of her room is 20 feet (14 sq ft / 7 ft width = 20 ft).
"Response: 24 square feet. Explanation: If Ji-seo's room is 3 meters long and 5 meters wide, and she already has 16 square feet of carpet, then to cover the entire floor area, she would need an additional 8 square feet (3 meters x 5 meters = 15 meters; 15 meters x 0.16 square feet/meter = 2.4 square feet). Therefore, the total amount of carpet needed for the room is 24 square feet (16 + 8 = 24)."
Response: 56 tiles are needed to cover the entire floor.
Response: 144 pieces of carpet are needed to cover all the floors in 20 rooms with dimensions of 6 meters long and 6 meters wide.
Response: 12 meters. Explanation: According to the question, Jesse's room is 6 meters wide and 6 meters long, which means its area is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since the width of the room is greater than its length, we can conclude that the length of the room is 36 / 2 = 18 meters. Therefore, the distance from one end of the room to the other is 18 meters.
Response: 3 feet. Explanation: If the length of the room is 1.5 feet and the width is needed to cover 10 square feet, then the width of the room is 3 feet (10 / 1.5 = 3).
Response: 5 feet. Explanation: If the width of the room is 2 feet and the length is needed to cover 10 square feet, then the length of the room is 5 feet (10 / 2 = 5).

Response:  The store sold 960 t-shirts (23 x 40 = 960).
"Response:  $51 / 3 = $17

Explanation:
The store sold 3 t-shirts for $51, so the price of each t-shirt is $51 / 3 = $17."
Response:  $87 \times 0.47 = 39.69$  dollars.
"Response: 137
Explanation: According to the passage, the total number of t-shirts sold by the store during both games is 242. In the Arkansas game, they sold 115 t-shirts, and in the Texas Tech game, they sold 137 t-shirts. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 137 - 115 = 22."
"Response:  $105,724$
Explanation:
The total amount of money made by the store during both games is $98 x 2 = $196$. The number of t-shirts sold in Arkansas game is $89$, so the average price per t-shirt is $\frac{89}{2} \times 98 = $105$. Therefore, the store made $105 \times 89 = $9,310$ from selling t-shirts in the Arkansas game alone.
In Texas Tech game, the store sold $74$ t-shirts, and the average price per t-shirt is again $\frac{74}{2} \times 98 = $105$. So, the store made $105 \times 74 = $7,960$ from selling t-shirts in the Texas Tech game.
Therefore, the total amount of money made by the store from selling t-shirts during both games is $9,310 + 7,960 = $17,270$."
"Response:  $140$
Explanation:
If they sold 172 t-shirts at the Arkansas game and 186 t-shirts in total, then they sold 186 - 172 = 14 t-shirts more at the Texas Tech game. Therefore, they made an additional $14 x $78 = $1052$ in revenue from selling t-shirts at the Texas Tech game."
"Response:  $62 x 183 = $11,540$

Explanation:
The question states that the laser back store sold 183 t-shirts and 31 uniforms during the Arkansas vs Texas tech game. If each t-shirt costs $62 and each uniform costs $99, then the total amount of money earned from selling these items is calculated as follows:

$62 x 183 = $11,540 (t-shirts)
$99 x 31 = $3,079 (uniforms)
Total amount of money earned = $11,540 + $3,079 = $14,619
Therefore, the laser back store earned a total of $14,619 from selling t-shirts and uniforms during the Arkansas vs Texas tech game."
Response:  The total amount of money that the laser back store sold in Texas and Arkansas during the technology competition was $109,280.
Response:  $192 - $34 = $158$ The price of the t-shirts is $158 more than the price of the uniforms.
"Response:  $170$
Explanation: According to the passage, one t-shirt costs $86$, and one uniform costs $232$. Therefore, if they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 uniforms during the game, the total revenue from t-shirts would be $254 \times 86 = 219,600$, and the total revenue from uniforms would be $43 \times 232 = 9,786$. So, the difference between the price of t-shirts and uniforms is $219,600 - 9,786 = 209,814$."
"Response:  $42,900
Explanation:
The store sold 130 t-shirts at $51 each during the Arkansas and Texas technology fair. Therefore, the total revenue from selling t-shirts was $6,430 ($51 x 130). Since they offered an 8% discount, they earned $5,072 in profit ($6,430 - $1,358) from selling t-shirts. So, the store made $42,900 in total ($5,072 x 8)."
"Response:  $217 x 14 = $2968

Explanation:
The price of one t-shirt was $201, and they sold 14 t-shirts in total. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts is $201 x 14 = $2850."
Response:  If they sold $60 worth of t-shirts and each t-shirt costs $10, then they sold 6 t-shirts.
"Response:  $215 / 5 = $43

Explanation:
The store sold 5 t-shirts and made $215 in revenue. Since there are 5 t-shirts, we can divide the total revenue by 5 to find out how much each t-shirt cost: $215 ÷ 5 = $43 per t-shirt."
"Response:  $390
Explanation:
The store sold 20 t-shirts and 64 uniforms during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, which means they earned total revenue of $20 x $5 = $100 from t-shirt sales and $64 x $215 = $13,700 from uniform sales. Therefore, the total amount of money the store earned from these sales is $100 + $13,700 = $13,800."
"Response:  $362$

Explanation:
The store sold 158 t-shirts and 2 uniforms during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, which means they earned total revenue of $158 x $76 = $11,960 from t-shirt sales and $2 x $204 = $408 from uniform sales, for a grand total of $11,960 + $408 = $16,368."
"Response:  $240 - $177 = $63$

Explanation:
The price of the shirt is $210, and the number of shirts sold is 177. Therefore, the total revenue from shirts is $210 x 177 = $38,900. The price of the uniforms is $240, and the number of uniforms sold is 23. Therefore, the total revenue from uniforms is $240 x 23 = $5,460. So, the difference between the revenue from shirts and uniforms is $38,900 - $5,460 = $63,440."
"Response: 47
Explanation: According to the passage, the store sold 115 dollars worth of t-shirts and 25 dollars worth of uniforms during the Texas Tech game. Therefore, the difference between the price of t-shirts and uniforms is 115 - 25 = 90."
"Response: 50
Explanation: If they have 5 tables with 10 chairs each, then there are in total 5 x 10 = 50 chairs."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Since there are two sets of tables and each set has the same number of chairs, there will be twice as many chairs in total. Therefore, if there are 12 chairs in the backyard, then each table will have 6 chairs."
"Response: 3
Explanation: Since there are 9 chairs in the backyard and each table can seat 3 people, there will be 3 tables in total."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there are 11 tables and 13 chairs in the backyard. If there are 11 tables, then there must be 9 chairs (since each table has one chair)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, so the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. Since 11 people are sitting in the party, there are 60 - 11 = 49 chairs left empty."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 12 tables with 14 chairs each, for a total of 168 chairs. Since 6 chairs were left over, there are 9 extra chairs available for guests."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, there are 4 tables with 3 chairs each in the backyard, and a total of 14 people will attend the party. Therefore, they need an additional 7 chairs (4 tables x 3 chairs/table = 12 chairs; 14 guests - 12 chairs = 2 extra chairs)."
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, there are 14 chairs at each table and 9 tables in total. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. So, there are 126 - 14 = 112 chairs more than the number of tables."

"Response:  $584
Explanation:
If Louis paid $216 per month for 21 months and then had to pay $702 in taxes, he would have $584 left after paying the taxes."
"Response:  $73 \times 223 = 16,091$

Explanation:
If Lewis works for 223 weeks (or 5 years and 4 months) at $1357 per week, he will have earned a total of $16,091."
"Response:  $17654$
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Louis worked for 1091 weeks at $28 per hour.
* He also worked overtime for an additional $939 per week.

So, his total weekly income is:

$28/hour x 1091 weeks = $296,380$

Adding the overtime pay of $939 per week gives us the total income for the harvest season:

$296,380 + ($939 x 52 weeks) = $176,540$

Therefore, if Louis works overtime during the harvest season, he will make approximately $176,540."
"Response: 156783
Explanation:
If Louis pays $49 per day for rent and he worked for 233 weeks, then he earned a total of $156,783 during that time period."
"Response:  $10,056

Explanation:
If Louis pays $368 per week for the harvest season and he has to pay $388 per week as rent, then he will have to pay a total of $10,056 during the harvest season. This is calculated by multiplying the number of weeks in the harvest season (12) with the difference between his payment and the rent ($388 - $368 = $20)."
"Response:  $57300$

Explanation:
The farmer, Louis, earned $491 per day during the harvest season of 1181 days. If he had to pay $216 per day as rent, he would have paid a total of $264,616 ($491 x 1181) in rent during the entire harvest season. Therefore, at the end of the season, he would have $57300 left after paying the rent."
Response:  $133 / 19 weeks = $7.00 per week$
Response:  The farmer earned $178 in total during the harvest period. Since he worked for 10 weeks, the number of weeks in the harvest period is: 10 weeks x $178/week = 1780 weeks.
Response:  If Danny is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than him, then the depth of the water is 90 feet (10 x 9 = 90).
Response:  The water is 16 feet (4.9 meters) deep. Explanation: According to the passage, when Dirk decides to take a dip after his nap, the water is twice as deep as he is tall. Since Dirk is 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall, and the water is twice that depth, the water is 16 feet (4.9 meters) deep.
Response:  The depth of water is 5 times deeper than Ding's height. Since Ding is 3 meters shorter than Ron, the depth of water is 12 feet (approximately 4 meters) deep.
Response:  The depth of the water is 15 times greater than Ron's height. Since Ron is 1 meter taller than Ding, the depth of the water is 15 x 1 = 15 meters.
Response:  The depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height. Since Ron is 13 feet (approximately 4 meters) tall, the depth of the water is 16 x 13 = 208 feet (approximately 63 meters).
Response:  The water was 54 feet deep. Explanation: According to the passage, the depth of the water is 9 times the height of Ron. Since Ron is 15 feet tall and Ding is 6 feet shorter than Ron, the depth of the water is 9 x (15 - 6) = 9 x 9 = 81 feet. Therefore, the water was 81 + 6 = 87 feet deep.

"Response: 5 invitations are needed to ensure that at least one friend is not left out of the party.
Explanation: If there are 10 friends invited and each invitation has two lines (one for the host's name and one for the guest's name), then there will be a total of 20 lines of text. Since there are only 10 friends, it means that some friends will have their names listed twice. To avoid this, an additional 5 invitations would need to be sent, resulting in a total of 25 lines of text. This ensures that every friend has their own unique line and no one is left out of the party."
Response: 40 invitations. Explanation: According to the question, Carol sent out 12 friendship invitation cards to her 12 friends, and each friend received 3 invitation cards. Therefore, in total, Carol sent out 40 invitation cards.
"Response: 3
Explanation: If Carol sent invitations to only two friends, then she would have used up 2 of the 10 invitation cards included in the package. Therefore, there would be 8 remaining invitation cards (10 - 2 = 8)."
Response:  Carol can invite up to 55 friends (14 invitations x 6 accepted + 11 additional invitations).
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Carol wants to invite 9 friends to her party and she has already purchased 3 invitation cards, then she needs to buy additional 6 invitation cards. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response: 4 games.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Melissa scored 81 points in total across 3 games. Since she scored the same number of points in each game (81 / 3 = 27), there was no difference in the number of points she scored per game. Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response: 5643
Explanation:
Melissa scored 109 points per game and obtained 82 bonus points per game. Therefore, her total score for 79 games can be calculated as follows:
Total score = (Number of games x Points per game) + (Number of games x Bonus points per game)
= (79 x 109) + (79 x 82)
= 8,651 + 6,255
= 14,906
So Melissa scored 14,906 points in total over 79 games."
"Response: 3 games
Explanation: According to the question, Melissa scored 21 points in total across 3 games. Since she scored 7 points per game, she played 3 games."

Explanation:
The total number of people who can take 20 Parris wheels at the same time is 32. This is calculated by multiplying the number of seats in each wheel (19) by the maximum number of people who can sit in each seat (15). Therefore, the answer is 32."
Response: 240 people can simultaneously use the ferry at most. Explanation: The parking lot of Paradise Park has 18 seats, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are vacant, then the maximum number of people who can use the ferry at once is 18 x 15 = 270. However, since there are only 18 seats available, the actual number of people who can use the ferry simultaneously is 270 / 18 = 15.
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, each seat in the Ferris wheel can accommodate 14 people. Therefore, if there are currently 16 people sitting on the Ferris wheel, it means that there is room for an additional 20 people (16 - 14 = 20) to join them without exceeding the capacity of any one seat."
"Response: 76
Explanation:
The small seats can accommodate 14 people each, and there are 2 small seats in total. Therefore, the total number of people who can sit on the small seats is 14 x 2 = 28.
The large seats can accommodate 54 people each, and there are 23 large seats in total. Therefore, the total number of people who can sit on the large seats is 54 x 23 = 1220.
So, the total number of people who can sit in the park is 28 + 1220 = 1248."
"Response: 54 people can sit in the large seats of the Ferris wheel at once.
Explanation: The total number of small seats is 3 x 16 = 48, and the total number of large seats is 7 x 12 = 84. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can sit in the large seats at once is 84 / 2 = 42. Since there are 2 large seats per row, the total number of people who can sit in the large seats at once is 42 x 2 = 84."
Response:  The number of people who can fit in each seat of the Ferris wheel is 4. Therefore, the total number of people who can fit in all seats at once is 4 x 16 = 64.
Response: 8 seats. Explanation: If there are 4 people and each person can sit in one of the four wheels, then each wheel has 4/4 = 1 seat available for each person. Since there are 4 people, the total number of seats is 4 x 1 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 seats in each wheel.
"Response: 14/7 = 2

Explanation:
The number of slices in each pizza is equal to the number of orders received. Since there were 7 orders in total, and each order received 1 pizza, then the total number of slices is 7 x 1 = 7. Therefore, each slice represents 2/7 of the total number of slices."
Response: 14 pieces of pizza were ordered.
Response: 35 pieces of pizza. Explanation: If 17 people ordered 4 slices each of pizza, then total number of slices is 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people in total, each person will get approximately 35/25 = 35 slices of pizza.
Response: 5 pieces of pizza.

"Response: 40
Explanation:
From the information given in the question, we know that the two pigeons together planted 36 seeds. Out of these, only 12 seeds germinated and grew into flowers. Therefore, the number of seedlings that did not germinate is 36 - 12 = 24. Since there were 58 seeds in total, the number of seeds that did not grow into flowers is 58 - 24 = 34. So, there are 40 seedlings left after 12 seeds have grown into flowers."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, out of 55 seeds planted, only 15 were placed in the garden and grew into flowers. Therefore, 40 seeds did not grow into flowers. So, the number of flowers that grew is 40/55 = 30."
Response: 40. Explanation: If the pigeon had 10 seeds in its beak and it planted 60 seeds, then it would have planted 5 times as many seeds as it had in its beak. Therefore, there would be 40 flowers (5 x 8 = 40).

Response:  Matt ate 15 crackers and shared them equally among his 5 friends. If he had 10 crackers left after sharing them, then each friend ate 2 crackers (10/5).
"Response: 9
Explanation:
Matthew had 24 crackers and shared them equally among his 3 friends. So each friend got 8 crackers (24 / 3 = 8). Since Matthew gave away 17 crackers, he must have given 5 crackers to each of his 3 friends (17 / 3 = 5). Therefore, Matthews gave away 5 crackers to each of his friends."
"Response:  Matt ate 22 crackers and 34 cookies. If he shares them equally among his 11 friends, each friend will get:

22/11 = 2 cracker(s) per person
34/11 = 3 cookie(s) per person"
Response:  Matt ate 29 crackers and 30 cookies. If he shares them equally among his friends, each friend will eat 29/x + 30/x = 59 cookies and crackers, where x is the number of friends. Therefore, if Matt has 4 friends, they will eat 59/4 = 14.75 cookies and crackers each.
"Response:  Matt ate 14 crackers and 21 cookies. If he shares them equally among 7 friends, each friend will get:

14/7 = 2 crackers
21/7 = 3 cookies

Therefore, each friend will eat 2 crackers and 3 cookies in total."

"Response: 14.
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. Since each banana is divided into 7 groups, the number of bananas in each group is 203 / 7 = 28. Similarly, since each orange is divided into 95 groups, the number of oranges in each group is 63 / 95 = 0.66."
Response:  The size of each orange group is 2.03 cm^3. Explanation: According to the question, there are 356 oranges in total, and they are divided into 178 groups of size 2.03 cm^3 each.
Response:  Each group of bananas in Philip's collection contains 196 bananas, so there are 392 / 196 = 2 groups per each of Philip's 392 bananas. Therefore, each group is approximately 392/2 = 196 bananas big.
Response: 18 groups of 10 bananas each = 180 bananas total.
Response:  Each banana group contains 31 fruits, so there are 31 x 2 = 62 banana groups in total.
Response:  Each orange group contains 16 oranges, so there are 16 x 3 = 48 orange groups in total. Similarly, each banana group contains 345 bananas, so there are 345 x 16 = 5,440 banana groups in total. Therefore, the total number of orange and banana groups is 48 + 5,440 = 5,488.

Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day and 295 visitors the previous day, then the difference in the number of visitors between the two days is 22 (317 - 295).
"Response: 246

Explanation:
The passage states that ""703 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day."" If 246 of those visitors were present at the palace during the night (as mentioned in the last sentence), then the number of people who visited the palace during the day is 703 - 246 = 457."
Response:  If there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day, and they had a rich meal before visiting, then the number of visitors who visited the palace after having dinner would be 666 - 100 = 566. Therefore, there were 566 more visitors than the previous day.
"Response: 327 - 132 = 205

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on a certain day is 132.
* The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 327 days is 406.
* To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on that day from the total number of visitors over the period of 327 days.

Note: The word ""버킹엄"" in Korean is pronounced as ""Buk-king"" and means "" Buckingham""."
"Response: 583
Explanation:
The passage states that there were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 557 visitors during the day of the royal visit. If 188 people visited the palace the previous day, then the total number of visitors to the palace over the course of 57 days would be:

557 + (188 x 57) = 583
Therefore, the answer is 583."
"Response: 
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day was 661. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 61 visitors (661 - 600 = 61)."
"Response: 567
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day was 419.
* The number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace after having a rich meal was 92.
* Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace including both groups is 419 + 92 = 511.
So, there were 511 people who visited Buckingham Palace that day."
"Response: 363
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after the feast was 512.
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day was 471.
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace 89 days ago was 808.

Using these numbers, we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors the day before - Number of visitors 89 days ago
= 512 + 471 - 808
= 363

Therefore, the answer to the question is 363."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
If there were 191 visitors yesterday and 457 visitors two days ago, then the total number of visitors in the past 245 days is:
191 + 457 = 648
So, the number of visitors today is:
648 - 191 = 457
Therefore, the number of additional visitors today compared to the previous day is:
457 - 191 = 266"
"Response: 107g
Explanation:
The total weight of the hair is given as 159g, and it is required to have at least 628g of straw to make up for the lack of weight in the hair. Therefore, the person already has 107g of straw (628g - 159g = 469g)."
"Response: 32g
Explanation: According to the question, the total amount of color needed is 49g and the number of grams of red required is 288g. Therefore, the remaining amount of red is 288g - 260g = 32g."

Explanation: According to the question, the person needs 57g of color for their hair and already has 22g of that color. Therefore, they have a total of 34g (22g + 12g) of color left to buy. Since the packaging of the hair dye requires 353g of product, the person will need to purchase an additional 331g (353g - 34g) of hair dye."
"Response: 46g
Explanation:
The given information is:
* The weight of the hair is 166g.
* Currently, 20g of styling product are available.
To find out how much more styling product is needed, we need to subtract the current amount from the total weight of the hair.

166g - 20g = 46g
Therefore, 46g more styling product is needed."
"Response: 480g
Explanation:
The given information is:
* The weight of the hair that needs to be attached is 17g.
* The total weight of the hair in the checklist is 557g.

"Response:  $90 \times 6 = 540$ 

Explanation:
The passage states that 94 people can pick 90 tons of grapes in 6 days. To find out how many tons of grapes each person can pick per day, we divide the total amount of grapes picked by the number of people who picked them: $540$."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, it takes 266 workers 5 days to harvest 90 tons of grapes. Therefore, if we divide the total amount of grapes by the number of working days, we can calculate the average number of grape bunches that each worker can collect per day. In this case, each worker can collect approximately 31 bunches of grapes per day."
"Response: 3058
Explanation:
The farmer said that 294 workers harvested 244 crates of grapes and 47 crates of raspberries per day. Since there are 146 days in total, we can calculate the total number of crates as follows:
Total crates = Number of workers x Number of crates per day x Total days
= 294 x 244 x 146
= 3058
Therefore, the farmer could have harvested 3058 crates of grapes and raspberries during his last vacation."
"Response: 
The farmer could harvest 16,930 tons of grapes and 22,100 tons of raisins during the 77-day vacation period."
"Response: 2520
Explanation: If 252 people can collect 108 crates of grapes per day and it takes 58 days to harvest all the grapes, then the total number of crates that can be collected is calculated as follows:

Total number of days = 58 days
Number of people x Number of crates per day = 252 people x 108 crates/day = 26,344 crates
Therefore, the answer is 26,344 crates."

Response:  Tarlier had 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals, totaling 66 aquariums. Each aquarium held an average of 39 animals, so Tarlier had a total of 2478 animals (66 x 39).
Response:  Tarlier had 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals, totaling 96 aquariums. There were 46 marine animals in each of the 22 saltwater aquariums, for a total of 1008 marine animals. Therefore, Tailer had 1008 marine animals.
"Response: 87 (15 + 62) x 19 = 87

Explanation:
The first part of the question states that he had 15 aquariums for saltwater fish and 62 aquariums for freshwater fish. The second part of the question asks how many animals are in total.

Response: 94 (41 + 53)
Response: 7 x 14 = 98.
Response:  There are 7 bags.
"Response: 78
Explanation:
The total number of cookies = Number of bags x Number of cookies per bag + Number of candies x Number of candies per candy + Number of chocolates x Number of chocolates per chocolate
= 26 x 15 + 15 x 52 + 52 x 3
= 78
Therefore, there are 78 cookies in total."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
If there are 14 bags with equal amount of cookies and each bag contains 28 cookies, then the total number of cookies is 14 x 28 = 376.
Since there are also 86 pieces of candy, the total number of items in each bag is 376 + 86 = 462. Therefore, there will be 462/28 = 16 bags with cookies only (not including the bags with both cookies and candies)."
"Response: 

The number of houses in each block that will receive at least 5 junk emails is given by the formula:

Number of houses = Total number of blocks / Number of junk emails per block

Since there are 10 blocks in total and each block receives 5 junk emails, we have:

Number of houses = 10 / 5 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 houses in each block that will receive at least 5 junk emails."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If there are 10 blocks in total and each block has 20 houses, then there will be 5 emails sent to each house (since 20 / 5 = 4). Therefore, the total number of emails sent is 5 x 10 = 50."
"Response: 30 pieces of trash mail per house.

Explanation:
The problem states that there are 6 houses in one block and each house will receive 24 pieces of trash mail from the post office. Therefore, the total number of trash mails to be delivered to all 6 houses is 24 x 6 = 144. Since there are 6 houses in total, each house will receive 144 / 6 = 30 pieces of trash mail."
Response: 5 or fewer houses per block.  Explanation: According to the question, the postman delivers 14 convenience mail to each house in a block. If there are n houses in a block, then the postman will deliver 2 junk mails to each of the n houses, for a total of 2n junk mails. Since the question states that the postman sends only 14 convenience mails, it follows that n cannot be greater than 5, since 2n > 14. Therefore, there can be at most 5 houses per block.
"Response: 48
Explanation:
If there are 20 houses in one block and each house receives 32 pieces of trash mail from the same postman, then the total number of trash mails sent to all blocks is 20 x 32 = 640. Since there are 10 blocks in total, the total number of trash mails sent to all blocks is 640 / 10 = 64. Therefore, the postman needs to send 64 trash mails to all blocks."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
If there are 78 blocks and each block has 19 houses, then the total number of houses is 78 x 19 = 1428.
Since each house can send 30 pieces of trash mail, the total number of trash mails sent will be 1428 x 30 = 42840."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
If there are 55 blocks and each block has 8 trash mailbags, then the total number of trash mailbags is 55 x 8 = 440.
Since the postman wants to send at least 32 mails per house, the total number of houses in one block is 440 / 32 = 14.
Therefore, there will be 16 blocks (14 houses per block) in total."
"Response: 356
Explanation:
If there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, then there are in total 972 houses (81 x 12). Since each house needs to receive 4 trash mail, the total number of trash mails needed is 972 x 4 = 3888. Therefore, each person in one block will need to send 3888 / 81 = 47 trash mails."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
If there are 16 blocks and each block has 4 trash mailbags to deliver, then the total number of trash mailbags to deliver is 16 x 4 = 64.
However, if there are 17 houses in one block, then the total number of trash mailbags to deliver for that block is 17 x 4 = 68. Therefore, the total number of trash mailbags to deliver is 64 + 68 = 20."

"Response: 5
Explanation: If Rebecca has 11 groups of eggs and each group contains 2 eggs, then Rebecca has a total of 22 eggs (11 x 2 = 22). Since she wants to divide them equally among her friends, each friend will receive 5 eggs (22 / 5 = 5)."
Response:  Each group of Rebecca has 2 eggs. Therefore, there are 8 groups in total, and each group has 2 eggs, so the total number of eggs is 16.
Response:  Each group of eggs has 5 eggs, so there are 3 groups with 5 eggs each = 15 eggs in total.
Response:  There are 3 groups of objects in Rebecca's bag: eggs (6), bananas (18), and coins (66). Therefore, there are 3 groups or categories of objects in Rebecca's bag.

Response:  Jack has 12 apples (9 + 3).
Response:  Adam has 8 apples more than Jack. So, Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 apples more than Jack.
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 9 apples, so Jack has 1 more apple than Adam.
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the question, Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jack has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jack has. In this case, Jack has 2 more apples than Adam (10 - 8 = 2)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Adam and Jack have 6 apples between them. If there are more than 4 apples left after they combined theirs, then Adam must have at least 5 apples (since he has 3/6 of the total) and Jack must have at least 4 apples (since he has 2/6 of the total). Therefore, in total, there are 9 apples (5 + 4 = 9)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Adam and Jack have 7 apples between them. If there are 9 apples in total, then Adam has 4 apples (7 - 3 = 4) and Jack has 5 apples (7 - 2 = 5). Therefore, the number of apples that Adam has is 4 and the number of apples that Jack has is 5."
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jack has 8 apples, so together they have 18 apples.
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, Adam has 4 apples and Jack has 10 apples. Together, they have 2 more apples than Adam. Therefore, Adam has 8 apples in total."
Response:  Adam has 7 apples and Jack has 89 oranges and 11 apples. So, Adam has 7 + 89 = 96 fruits in total, while Jack has 11 + 7 = 18 fruits in total.

Response: 40 kg (approximately)
"Response: 92 kg
Explanation:
The person lost weight at a rate of 50 kg in the first week and 60 kg in the second week, for a total loss of 110 kg (50 + 60 = 110). Therefore, their current body weight is 92 kg (110 - 18 = 92)."
"Response: 78 kg
Explanation: According to the passage, Jesse's current weight is 9 kg, and he started exercising one week ago. In the first week, he lost 62 kg, which means his initial weight was 62 + 9 = 71 kg. In the second week, he lost another 140 kg, bringing his total loss to 202 kg. Therefore, Jesse's initial weight before starting exercise was 71 kg."

"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in one cave. If there were 64 snakes hiding, then there must have been some alligators remaining as well. Therefore, the total number of reptiles in the cave is 95 + 61 = 156."
"Response: 53
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 97 mares of snakes in the cave and 40 mares of crocodiles hiding. Since we know that 40/97 = 0.416 (or approximately 41.6%), then 53 mares of crocodiles must have been hiding in the cave."
"Response: 106 (19 + 82)

Explanation:
The passage states that there are 3 snakes and 75 alligators in one cave. If there are 82 snakes and 19 alligators hidden elsewhere, then the total number of alligators hidden in the caves is 106 (19 + 82)."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 79 animals in the cave, including 24 snakes and 51 bats. Therefore, if we subtract the number of snakes (24) from the total number of animals (79), we get 55. Since there are no other types of animals mentioned in the passage, it can be inferred that all 55 animals were bats."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
If there were initially 171 tomatoes and today there are 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes left, then the number of tomatoes that remained after 30 tomatoes were picked every day is 164 - 30 = 134 tomatoes. Therefore, 56 people would have been left with tomatoes after picking 30 tomatoes each day for 5 days (Monday to Friday)."
"Response: 73
Explanation:
The farmer had 160 tomatoes initially. If he picked 56 yesterday and 41 today, then the number of tomatoes left after picking is:
160 - 56 = 104
104 - 41 = 63
So there are 63 tomatoes left after picking both days."
"Response: 266 (rounded)
Explanation:
The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday. If he picked 50 tomatoes every day starting from today, he would have 266 tomatoes in total after 3 days (154 + 50 + 50 = 266)."
"Response: 39
Explanation: If the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes, and he collected 172 potatoes, then he has 13 tomatoes left (175 - 172 = 13)."
"Response: 126 (rounded)
Explanation:
If the farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes initially, then he had 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left after he picked 53 tomatoes. Similarly, he had 12 - 5 = 7 potatoes left after picking 5 potatoes. Therefore, there are 124 tomatoes and 7 potatoes remaining."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, John used 4 buckets to cut a large wooden board into smaller pieces. Since each bucket requires 2 pieces of wood, John needs 8 pieces of wood (4 buckets x 2 pieces/bucket). Therefore, he needs 3 boards to cover his house's wall (8 pieces / 3 boards per piece = 3 boards)."

"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, John used 16 panels of wood to cover his wall, and each panel requires 2 screws to be fixed. Therefore, John needs to drill 16 x 2 = 32 holes in the wall to fix all the panels. Since there are 8 holes per panel, John needs to drill 32 / 8 = 4 holes for each panel, or a total of 16 x 4 = 64 holes in the wall."
"Response: 56
Explanation: If each wooden panel requires 74 pots to fill them up, and John has 8 panels in total, then he needs 8 x 74 = 56 pots of soil to fill all the panels."
Response: 30 pieces of wood are needed to build the wall. Explanation: According to the question, John needs 14 pieces of large wooden boards and 25 pieces of small wooden boards to build the wall. Since each large board requires 14 pieces of mud and each small board requires 25 pieces of mud, in total, he needs 14 x 14 = 196 pieces of mud and 25 x 25 = 625 pieces of mud, respectively. Therefore, he needs a total of 196 + 625 = 821 pieces of wood to build the wall.

Response:  The machine produced 4 shirts per minute, so it produced a total of 20 shirts (4 x 5 minutes) during the 5-minute period.
Response:  If you made 9 shirts yesterday and today you can make 44 shirts per hour, then yesterday you worked for (44 - 9) = 35 minutes.
Response:  The machine can produce 13 shirts per day, and since it produced 3 shirts today, it means that it has been operating for 1/13 of a day. Therefore, the number of hours the machine operated is 1/13 x 24 = 6 hours.
Response: 30 minutes. Explanation: If the industry machine can produce 2 shirts per minute and produced 9 shirts yesterday, then it produced a total of 9 x 60 = 540 shirts in one hour. If it produced 8 shirts today, then it produced a total of 8 x 60 = 480 shirts in one hour. Therefore, it worked for 30 minutes to produce 480 - 540 = -70 shirts.
Response:  The machine can produce 3 shirts per minute. Therefore, if it produced 4 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today, it has operated for (4 + 8) = 12 minutes.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts per minute, so in 12 minutes it produced 6 x 12 = 72 shirts. And today it used 14 shirts, so the total number of shirts produced by the machine is 72 - 14 = 58 shirts.
Response:  The machine can produce 6 shirts per minute. Yesterday, it worked for 5 minutes and produced 12 shirts, so today it will produce 6 x 5 = 30 shirts.
