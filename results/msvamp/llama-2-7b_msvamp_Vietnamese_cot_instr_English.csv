Response:  Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. So, she played with more than 18 children on Monday. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with on Monday is greater than the number of children she played with on Tuesday. The difference between these two numbers is 8 (18 - 10). Hence, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 11 children on Sunday and 12 children on Monday, then she played with more than 11 children on Monday (since 12 is greater than 11). So, Julia played with more than 11 children on Monday.
Response:  If Julia plays with 5 children on Sunday and then plays with many other children on Monday, we can assume that she played with at least 6 children (including the 5 from Sunday) + however many more children she played with on Monday = 6 + x, where x is the number of additional children she played with on Monday. Since she played with 15 children in total, we have the equation: 6 + x = 15. Solving for x gives us x = 9. Therefore, Julia played with 9 children on Monday.
Response:  If Julia plays with 14 children on Thursday and she plays with total of 16 children including both days, then she played with 2 additional children on Friday (Thursday + Friday = 2). So, Julia played with 14 + 2 = 16 children in total over two days.
Response:  If Julia plays with 16 children on Sunday and she plays with fewer than 12 children on Monday, then she must play with exactly 12 children on Monday. So, the number of children Julia plays with on Monday is 12.
Response:  If Julia plays with 14 children on Thursday and she played with 8 children on Wednesday, then she played with more than 8 children on Wednesday. So, if she played with 8 children on Wednesday, she played with at least 6 children (since 8 is greater than 6). Therefore, Julia played with 6 + 8 = 14 children in total between Wednesday and Thursday.
Response:  If Julia plays with 17 children on Monday, and 15 children on Tuesday, then she plays with a total of 32 children (17 + 15).  And if she also plays with 2 children on Thursday, then she plays with a total of 34 children (32 + 2). Therefore, Julia plays with 34 children in total.
Response:  Julia plays with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So far, she has played with a total of 33 children (15 + 18). Now, she will play with 97 children on Thursday. Therefore, her total number of games played is 97 + 33 = 120 games.
Response:  Julia plays with 5 children on Monday and 9 children on Tuesday. Therefore, she plays with a total of 14 children (5 + 9 = 14).
Response:  On Monday and Wednesday (thứ Ba và thứ Tư), Julia played with 2 children each day. Therefore, she played with a total of 2 x 2 = 4 children on those days. So, Julia played with 4 children on Monday and Wednesday.
Response:  Julia plays with 9 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. Therefore, she plays with more than 9 children on Monday (9 + 7 = 16). Now let's consider Thursday. Since there are 96 children in total, Julia must play with at least 96 / 4 = 23 children on Thursday. So, Julia plays with more than 23 children on Thursday.
Response:  Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday. Then she played with 8 children on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with more than 14 children on Monday (the day after she played with 2 children). Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 14 children.
Response:  Julia plays with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Thursday. So, how many children does she play with more than on Thursday compared to Monday?  We can see that Julia plays with 3 more children (11 - 8 = 3) more than on Thursday compared to Monday. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday, then she played with more than 33 children (15 + 18 = 33).  And if she played with 7 children on Thursday, then she played with fewer than 33 children (33 - 7 = 26). So, Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Thursday.
Response:  On Monday (Thursday), Julia played with 13 children. +On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. =Total number of children Julia played with on those two days = 13 + 10 = 23 children.  Therefore, Julia played with 23 children in total.
Response:  On Monday (Thursday), Julia played with 7 children. +On Friday (Saturday), she played with 13 children. =Total number of children Julia played with on those two days = 7 + 13 = 20 So, Julia played with 20 children on Thursday and Saturday.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Julia played with 12 children for 6 hours = 60 minutes. On Tuesday (day 2), she played with 14 children for 7 hours = 7 x 60 = 420 minutes. Therefore, Julia spent a total of 580 minutes playing chess with both groups combined. So, Julia played with 14 children in total.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Julia played with 19 children for x hours. Then, on Tuesday (day 2), she played with 18 children for y hours, where y < x. So, the total time Julia spent playing chess on both days is: 38 hours = x + y. Since y < x, we can write: x > y. Therefore, Julia played with more than 18 children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Wednesday and 6 children on Tuesday. So, she played with more than 5 but fewer than 6 children on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday and Thursday is 1 (6 - 5 = 1).
Response:  Julia plays with 18 children in total. She plays with 4 children on Monday and with some other children on Tuesday. So, she plays with how many children on Tuesday?
Response:  Julia played with 4 children on Thursday and 6 children on Sunday. Therefore, she played with more than 4 but fewer than 6 children on Thursday. So, the number of children Julia played with on Thursday is between 4 and 6, inclusive. The only possible values are 5 or 6. Thus, Julia played with 5 or 6 children on Thursday.
Response:  If Bobby started eating 5 pieces of candy at first and then ate another 25 pieces later, he would have eaten a total of 30 pieces of candy (5 + 25 = 30). So, if he had eaten 43 pieces of candy in total, that means he ate 13 more pieces after he started eating the additional 25 pieces (43 - 30 = 13). Therefore, Bobby ate 13 more pieces of candy after he started eating the additional 25 pieces.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy and then ate an additional 42 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 63 pieces of gumdrops. Therefore, in total, Bobby has eaten 70 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy and other sweets.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then ate 4 more. So he ate in total 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 14 pieces of gum. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and gum.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then ate an additional 36 pieces. So he ate in total 38 + 36 = 74 pieces of candy. Now, let's compare this to how many pieces of chocolate he ate. He ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby ate more pieces of candy than chocolate (74 - 16 = 58).
Response:  Firstly, Bobby had already eaten 20 pieces of candy before he ate more. So, the total number of candies Bobby has eaten is 20 + (34 - 20) = 54. Then, after eating additional 18 pieces, Bobby has eaten in total 54 + 18 = 72 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 72 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Bobby initially had 21 pieces of candy and then ate 5 more. So, he has 21 + 5 = 26 pieces of candy now. Later, he eats another 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby currently has 26 + 9 = 35 pieces of candy.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. If he ate some and then ate another 5 pieces, how many pieces did he have after eating the second batch?  So, if he had x pieces before, he would have x + 5 pieces after eating the second batch.  Now we are given that he still has 8 pieces left, so we can set up the equation: x + 5 = 8.  Solving for x, we get: x = 13.  Therefore, Bobby had 13 pieces of candy at first and ate 5 more later, leaving him with 8 pieces remaining.
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 19 pieces of candy. If he eats 2 more pieces, then he will have eaten a total of 21 pieces of candy. So, Bobby still has 11 pieces of candy left (21 - 19 = 11).
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have less than 32 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces he ate, but we can assume that it is a finite number (not all of them). So, if he has 20 pieces left after eating some, that means he must have eaten at least 12 pieces (since he started with 32 and ended with 20). Therefore, Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 pieces of candy. Then he ate 17 more pieces, so he has eaten a total of 36 + 17 = 53 pieces of candy. Finally, he ate another 15 pieces, so there are now 53 - 15 = 38 pieces of candy left. Therefore, there are 38 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 30 pieces of candy. If he ate 23 pieces, then he has 7 remaining pieces of candy (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 3 balls. So, in total, they have 5 + 3 = 8 balls at the park. Therefore, Allan has more balls than Jake at the park (5 > 3).
Response:  We know that Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls. So, we can say that Allan has x balls less than Jake. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls owned by Allan and Jake is equal to 3 (the number of balls Jake owns). Thus, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 3.  Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. Since x represents the number of balls Allan has, we can set up the following inequality based on the information given in the problem: 0 < x < 3.  From here, we can solve for x using basic algebra. For example, if we divide both sides of the inequality by 3, we get:  x/3 = 2.  This means that Allan has exactly 2 balls at the park.
"Response:  If Allan carries 2 balls to the park and Jake carries x balls, then we know that the total number of balls carried by both is equal to 3 (the initial number of balls). So, we can write an equation as follows:

Allan + Jake = 3... (1)

Now, we are given that Allan carries 2 balls. Therefore, we can substitute this value in equation (1):

2 + Jake = 3... (2)

Jake must carry 1 ball to the park.

So, the answer is 1."
Response:  If Jake has 6 balls and he gives 2 to Allan, then Allan has 2 + 2 = 4 balls at the park. So, Allan has fewer balls than Jake. Therefore, the correct answer is (Jake - Allan) = 6 - 4 = 2 balls.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls and Jake has x more than Allan, then we can write an equation as follows:  A = 5 (where A is the number of balls carried by Allan)  J = x + 5 (where J is the number of balls carried by Jake). Now we are given that Jake carries more balls than Allan, so we know that J > A. Substituting this into our previous equation gives us:  J = x + 5 > 5. Solving for x, we get:  x = 3. Therefore, Jake carries 3 more balls than Allan to the park.
Response:  At first, Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls, so together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balls in the park. Then, Allan buys 2 more balls at the park, which brings the total number of balls to 8 + 2 = 10 balls. Therefore, Allan and Jake have 10 balls in the park.
"Response:  At first, Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 4 balls, so they have together 6 balls (2 + 4 = 6). Then, Allan buys additional 3 balls at the park, bringing his total to 5 balls (2 + 3 = 5). Now, we compare how many balls each of them has in the park:  Allan - 5 balls; Jake - 4 balls. So, Allan has more balls than Jake in the park."
Response:  At first, Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 6 balls in total. Then, Allan buys additional 3 balls at the park. So now, Allan has 5 balls (including the initial 2) and Jake still has 6 balls. Therefore, Jake has more balls than Allan in the park, which means that Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 extra ball.
Response:  At first, Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 4 balls, so together they have 9 balls (5 + 4 = 9). Then, Allan buys 3 more balls at the park, which brings the total number of balls he has to 12 (9 + 3 = 12). So, Allan has 12 balls in total when he arrives at the park.
Response:  At first, Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 2 balls, so Allan has 6 + 2 = 8 balls in total. Then, Jake buys 3 more balls at the park, so he now has 2 + 3 = 5 balls in total. Therefore, Allan has 8 - 5 = 3 more balls than Jake at the park.
Response:  Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 3 balls initially. So, Allan has 6 - 3 = 3 more balls than Jake at first. Then, Jake buys 4 additional balls at the park. Now, Jake has 3 + 4 = 7 balls in total. Therefore, Jake has 7 balls more than Allan in the park.
Response:  At first, Jake has 6 balls and Allan has 5 balls. So together they have 6 + 5 = 11 balls. Then Jake buys 3 more balls at the park. So now Jake has 6 + 3 = 9 balls in total. Therefore, Jake has 9 balls at the park.
Response:  Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls plus 59 balls = 64 balls in total. So they have altogether 3 + 64 = 67 balls at the park.
Response:  Allan has 7 balls and Jake has 6 balls, so together they have 7 + 6 = 13 balls. Since they went to the park with 5 balls each, there are 13 - 5 = 8 balls left in the park. Therefore, Allan and Jake have 8 balls in the park.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls and he goes to the park with Jake who also has some balls, then we can say that Jake has x number of balls. Since they both go together to the park, the total number of balls at the park is equal to 5 + x. Now, if they add another ball (i.e., 6), then the new total number of balls at the park becomes 5 + x + 1 = 7. Therefore, Jake must have x = 2 balls at the park. So, Jake has 2 balls at the park.
"Response: 
Allan has 2 balls at the park initially. Then he buys 3 more balls there. So, Allan has 5 balls (2 + 3) at the park in total.
Jake also goes to the park and brings 6 balls with him. Therefore, the number of balls that Jake has at the park is 6 - 5 = 1 more than Allan. In other words, Jake has 1 ball more than Allan at the park."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he studies English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, in this case, Ryan spends 6 + 2 = 8 hours studying both languages per day. Therefore, he studies English for 8 - 2 = 6 hours more than Chinese per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese. So he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours studying languages per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Ryan spends 13/24 = 0.54 hours studying Chinese for every hour he studies English. Therefore, Ryan spends 0.54 hours studying Chinese more than he does studying English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and then studies Chinese for a few hours more each day, he will spend a total of 4 hours studying Chinese per day. So, if he spends 4 hours studying Chinese per day, he will have spent a total of 12 hours (4 x 3) studying Chinese in one week. Therefore, Ryan has studied Chinese for 12 hours in one week.
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and also studies Chinese for a few hours each day, then he spends more time studying English than Chinese. So if he spends 2 extra hours studying English per day, that means he spends 9 hours (7 + 2) studying English per day. Therefore, he spends 9/14 = 0.64 hours studying Chinese per day.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and some time studying English. If he spends more than 2 hours studying English each day, then he spends how many hours studying English per day?  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese per day, so if he spends more than 2 hours studying English, he must spend at least 3 hours studying English per day (since 5 - 2 = 3). Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours studying English per day."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese.  If he studies for 5 days, then he will spend a total of:

English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
Therefore, Ryan will have spent a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages over the course of 5 days."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English per day and 5 hours studying Chinese per day.  If he studies for 2 days, how many total hours will he spend studying both languages?
Total hours = Number of hours studying English x Number of days studying English + Number of hours studying Chinese x Number of days studying Chinese
= 6 x 2 + 5 x 2
= 12 + 10
= 22 hours
Therefore, Ryan will spend 22 hours studying both languages over the course of two days."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese.  Therefore, he studies for a total of 9 hours per day (5 + 4 = 9).
If he studies for 6 days, then he will have studied for a total of 54 hours (9 x 6 = 54)."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese, then he will spend a total of:

English: 4 x 86 = 352 hours
Chinese: 6 x 86 = 506 hours
Therefore, Ryan will spend 352 hours studying English and 506 hours studying Chinese over the course of 86 days."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he studies for 6 x 24 = 144 minutes per day. 
He also spends 7 hours per day studying Chinese, which means he studies for 7 x 24 = 168 minutes per day.  Finally, he spends 3 hours per day studying Spanish, which means he studies for 3 x 24 = 72 minutes per day.  Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 144 + 168 + 72 = 384 minutes per day on his language studies."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day.  He also studies Chinese for 3 hours per day and Spanish for 58 hours per week.
To find out how many hours he spends studying English more than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages.
So, let's do that calculation:
Total hours studying both languages = 6 + 3 = 9 hours/day
Total hours studying English = 9 x 7 = 63 hours/week
Total hours studying Chinese = 9 x 3 = 27 hours/week
Now, let's compare the amount of time Ryan spends studying English with the amount of time he spends studying Chinese:
Hours studying English > Hours studying Chinese (by 63 - 27 = 36 hours)
Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying English than he does studying Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 9 hours studying languages per day (7 + 2 = 9).
Now, we know that Ryan spends more time studying English than Spanish. So, to find out how many hours he spends studying English compared to Spanish, we can divide the number of hours he spends studying English by the number of hours he spends studying Spanish.
Let's assume that Ryan spends 4 hours studying Spanish per day. To calculate the ratio of time spent studying English to time spent studying Spanish, we can use the following formula:
Time studied English / Time studied Spanish = X
Where X is the ratio of time spent studying English to time spent studying Spanish.
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
X = 9/4 = 2.25
Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 2.25 times more hours studying English than he does studying Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese per day. Therefore, he studies Chinese for 5 x 2 = 10 hours per day.
He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish per day. So, he studies Spanish for 4 x 2 = 8 hours per day.
Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying Chinese than Spanish. The difference in hours is 8 - 2 = 6 hours per day."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and he spends 2 hours studying Chinese per day, then we can calculate how many hours he studies Chinese as follows:

Total time spent studying English = 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week
Total time spent studying Chinese = Total time spent studying English - Time spent studying English/Week = 21 hours/week - 3 hours/day = 18 hours/day
Therefore, Ryan spends 18 hours studying Chinese each day."
"Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese. Since he studies both languages for 7 days in total, we can calculate his daily time spent as follows:

English: 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours
Chinese: 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours
Total time spent studying: 28 + 35 = 63 hours
Therefore, Ryan spends 63 hours studying English and Chinese over the course of 7 days."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 8 plastic bottles. The next day, she found 7 additional plastic bottles of equal value to the ones she collected on Monday. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 plastic bottles. Therefore, Tiffany had more plastic bottles on Monday than she found the next day.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 7 plastic bottles. The next day (Tuesday), she found an additional 12 plastic bottles with value of $X. So, in total, Tiffany collected $X + 7 = 19 plastic bottles.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 4 plastic bottles. The next day (Tuesday), she found some additional plastic bottles of value. If she has a total of 6 bottles now, then she must have found x bottles on Tuesday. Since she had 4 bottles already on Monday, we can write an equation: 4 + x = 6. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. So, Tiffany found 2 additional plastic bottles on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected some cans and found 4 more cans with value of $10 each. So she has a total of 8 cans. Therefore, the number of cans Tiffany had on Monday is 8.
Response:  On Day 1, Tiffany collected 10 boxes. If she found 3 more boxes on Day 2, then the total number of boxes she has is 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, Tiffany has 13 boxes in total.
Response:  On Day 1, Tiffany collected 8 cans.  On Day 2, she found 10 more cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 cans in total.  Then, on the next day (Day 3), she found 4 more cans, bringing the total number of cans to 18 + 4 = 22 cans. Therefore, Tiffany found a total of 22 cans after Day 2.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 3 bottles. The next day she found 7 more bottles and 44 cans. So in total, Tiffany has 3 + 7 = 10 bottles.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples than green apples there are, we can subtract the number of green apples from the number of red apples:

Number of red apples - Number of green apples = More red apples

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

17 - 16 = 1

So, there is one more red apple than green apple in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples than red apples there are, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples:

Number of green apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples
= 11 - 5
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the bag. If we add these two quantities together, we get:

Total number of apples = 10 + (some green apples)

Since we don't know exactly how many green apples there are, let's call it ""x"". So, we can write:

Total number of apples = 10 + x

Now, we want to find out how many green apples there are in the bag. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by 10 (since each red apple represents 10 green apples):

Number of green apples = Total number of apples / 10
= 10 + x / 10

So, if there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the bag, then there are approximately x/10 green apples in the bag."
Response:  We know that there are 3 red apples and some green apples in the bag. If we have more than 10 green apples than red apples in the bag, then the number of green apples must be greater than or equal to 10. So, the number of green apples in the bag is between 10 and 13 (inclusive). Therefore, the answer is 12.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples, 15 yellow apples, and 8 green apples in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:  
Red apples = 7 Yellow apples + 8 Green apples = 20 (since each red apple is equal to 2 yellow apples) = 40 ( since each yellow apple is equal to 3 green apples) = 120 ( since each green apple is equal to 4 red apples) = 480 ( since there are 9 colors of apples). Therefore, there are 480 apples in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples (71), 7 yellow apples (7), and 8 green apples (8) in the basket. Now we need to find out how many more green apples than red apples are in the basket. So let's subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples:  Number of green apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples  Number of green apples = 7 + 7 + 8 = 22  Therefore, there are 22 green apples more than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 14 quails of orange apples and 6 quails of yellow apples in the basket. Therefore, the total number of apples is 14 + 6 = 20. Now we need to find out how many more green apples than yellow apples are in the basket. According to the question, there are 3 more green apples than yellow apples in the basket. So, the number of green apples is 3 more than the number of yellow apples, which is 6. Therefore, the number of green apples is 6 + 3 = 9. Hence, there are 9 green apples more than yellow apples in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples and 11 golden apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples than golden apples there are, we can subtract the number of golden apples from the total number of red apples:

Number of red apples = 19
Number of golden apples = 11
Difference between red and golden apples = Number of red apples - Number of golden apples
= 19 - 11
= 8
Therefore, there are 8 more red apples than golden apples in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 90 yellow apples in the bag. Also, we know that there are 16 green apples in the bag. So, let's count how many red and green apples there are in total: Red apples = 6 Yellow apples = 90 Green apples = 16 Total number of apples = Red + Yellow + Green = 6 + 90 + 16 = 172 Therefore, there are 172 apples in the bag - 6 red apples and 16 green apples.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket.  To find out how many red apples and yellow apples are in the basket, we can use the following equation: Number of red apples = 18 Number of yellow apples = 14 Now, let's substitute these values into the equation to solve for each type of apple: Number of red apples = 18 Number of yellow apples = 14 Substituting the given values into the equation, we get: Number of red apples = 18 Number of yellow apples = 14 Therefore, there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples, 14 yellow apples, and 6 green apples in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Red Apples = 5 Yellow Apples + Green Apples
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
5 = 14 + 6
Solving for ""Green Apples"", we get:
Green Apples = 9
Therefore, there are 9 green apples in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 65 baskets of oranges. Each basket contains 7 red oranges and 3 green oranges. So, we can write an equation as follows:  
Total number of red oranges = Number of baskets × Number of red oranges per basket Total number of green oranges = Number of baskets × Number of green oranges per basket Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations:  
Number of baskets = 65 Total number of red oranges = 65 × 7 = 455 Total number of green oranges = 65 × 3 = 195 Therefore, there are 455 red oranges and 195 green oranges in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 pails and each pail contains 10 red apples and 18 green apples. So, in total, we have:
Red apples = 10 x 11 = 110
Green apples = 18 x 11 = 208
Therefore, the total number of apples is 110 + 208 = 318 apples."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 giỏ (baskets) in total. Each basket contains 16 red apples and 18 green apples. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Red Apples = Total number of apples - Green Apples
= 6 Giant + 16 Red Apples - 18 Green Apples
= 6 \* 16 + 0 - 18
= 96 - 18
= 78
Therefore, there are 78 red apples in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 pails and each pail contains 10 red apples and 2 green apples. So, in total, we have:
Red apples = 7 x 10 = 70
Green apples = 7 x 2 = 14
Therefore, there are 14 green apples in all the pails combined."
Response:  We know that there are total 11 quails (4 red + 3 green). Now we want to find out how many groups of quail there are in total. To do this, we divide the total number of quails by the number of quails in each group. In this case, we have: Total number of quails = 11 Quails per group = 4/3 = 1.33 Groups of quails = Total number of quails / Number of quails per group = 11 / 1.33 = 8.33 groups So, there are approximately 8.33 groups of quails in total.
Response:  We know that there are two bowls with apples and oranges. Each bowl has 4 red apples and some green oranges. To find out how many green oranges each bowl has, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of fruits in each bowl. So, for Bowl A, we have: Total number of fruits = 4 + (some) = 4 + x Where x is the number of green oranges. Since there are 12 fruits in total, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 12 Now, solve for x: x = 8 So, each bowl has 8 green oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 16 quails in total and 13 of them are red. So, we have 13/16 = 0.8125 (approximately) quail xan in the basket. Since we also know that there is one green quail among the remaining 3 quails, we can assume that there are 3 - 1 = 2 green quails in the basket. Therefore, the number of green quails in the basket is 2.
Response:  We know that each bag contains 19 red apples and 4 green apples. So, if there are 15 bags in total, then the number of red apples is 19 x 15 = 285, and the number of green apples is 4 x 15 = 60. Therefore, there are 285 + 60 = 345 apples in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 apples in total and they are distributed equally among some number of boxes (or ""giỏ""). Since each box contains 4 red apples and 6 green apples, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of boxes = Total number of apples / Number of apples per box

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of boxes = 10 / (4 + 6)
= 10 / 10
= 1

Therefore, there is only one box or container where all the 10 apples are placed."
Response:  We have 6 green apples (G), 60 yellow apples (Y), and 2 red apples (R). The total number of apples is G + Y + R = 6 + 60 + 2 = 78. Since there are more green apples than red apples, we can say that the number of green apples exceeds the number of red apples by 6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, the number of green apples in the basket is 4 more than the number of red apples. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 animals in his room. Then he added more animal images to the shelf, making the total number of animations on the shelf equal to 12 (including the original 4). So, if we add the new ones to the old ones, the total number of animations on the shelf now is 16 (12 + 4). Therefore, Jerry has added 12 new animations to the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 animals in his room. Then he added 7 more animals to the room. So, now Jerry has a total of 12 animals (5 + 7 = 12) in his room. Therefore, the original number of animals that Jerry had in his room was 5.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 4 animals and 22 books in his room. Then he added 6 more animals to the collection. So, the total number of objects (animals + books) that Jerry has is:  4 + 22 = 26  And then he added 6 more animals, so the updated total number of objects in Jerry's room is:  26 + 6 = 32  Therefore, there are 32 objects (animals and books) in Jerry's room.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 5 animals and 9 books in his room. Then he added 7 more actions to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is now 5 + 9 = 14. Since each action represents one book less than the original number of books, we can deduce that there are 14 - 9 = 5 books left on the shelf after adding the new actions. Therefore, there are 5 more books than the initial number of books on the shelf belonging to Jerry.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 10 books and 2 moving objects in his room. So, there were 10 + 2 = 12 items in total. Then, he added 4 more moving objects to the room, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 items in total. Therefore, there are 16 - 10 = 6 more books than the initial number of moving objects in Jerry's room.
Response:  Jerry initially had 8 animals and 9 books on his shelf. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf, so now he has 8 + 9 = 17 items in total. Therefore, there are 17 cups of books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Then he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 7 + 4 = 11 items on his shelf. Therefore, there are 11 - 2 = 9 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 5 objects (con vật) and 2 books in his room. So, the total number of items he had was 5 + 2 = 7. Then, he added 9 more books to the collection, so the new total is 7 + 9 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 books more than the initial number of objects in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 animals in his room. Then he added 4 more humans to make it 12 animals and 4 humans in total. Finally, he removed 5 of them, leaving him with 7 animals and 3 humans. So there are 7 animals and 3 humans on Jerry's shelf now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 animals in his room. Then he added 4 more people to the box and removed some of them. So, after that operation, there are 7 entities (3 + 4 -?) inside the box. Therefore, Jerry has taken out 1 entity from the box.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 animals in his room. Then he added some more images and removed 10 of them from the original 7. So, after these operations, Jerry has $7 + X$ images on his shelf, where $X$ is the number of images he added. Since there are only $8$ images left on the shelf, we have $7 + X = 8$, which simplifies to $X = 5$. Therefore, Jerry added $5$ new images to his collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 animals acting in his room. Then he added 2 more human actors and removed 7 of them. So, if there were originally 10 animals acting in Jerry's room, now he has 3 + 2 = 5 animals left.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 9 animals in his room. Then he added 7 more animals to the room. So, now Jerry has 9 + 7 = 16 animals in his room. If Jerry also has 10 books on his shelf, then there are 16 - 10 = 6 additional animals in his room that are not books. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room. Then he added 2 more people to the collection. So, now Jerry has 3 + 4 = 7 items in total. Therefore, there are 7 - 3 = 4 more action figures than books in Jerry's room.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. Then he added 2 more people to the mix. So, now there are 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Therefore, there are 10 - 2 (the number of action figures) = 8 books left in Jerry's room after adding the two new people.
Response:  If there are already 3 birds sitting on the fence and another bird comes to join them, then there will be a total of 4 birds on the fence (including the new bird).  If another bird joins them later, there will be a total of 5 birds on the fence (including both old and new birds). Therefore, if there were initially 3 birds on the fence, and then 2 more birds joined them, there would be a total of 5 birds on the fence.
Response:  At first, there were 4 chickens sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more chickens came and joined them. So, in total, there are now 8 chickens (4 original + 4 new) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the number of chickens that have been sitting on the fence since they started is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 4 chickens and 46 snails sitting on the fence. If 6 more chickens have arrived, then the total number of chickens is now 4 + 6 = 10. So, there are 10 chickens sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 2 turtles already sitting on the fence. If we add 5 more birds to join them, then the total number of birds will be 8 (3 + 5). Since each bird can sit on one spot, the total number of spots occupied by all birds is also 8. Therefore, the number of spots left for the turtles is 2 (the original 2 turtles plus the additional 3 birds). So, in total, there are 10 creatures (birds and turtles) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens and 4 turtles sitting on the fence. Two more chickens have come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 chickens (including the two new ones) and 4 turtles. Therefore, there are more chickens than turtles sitting on the fence. The answer is 5 - 4 = 1 more chicken than turtle.
Response:  We have 5 chickens and 6 snails sitting on the fence.  Then, 3 more chickens come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 + 3 = 8 chickens. Now, let's count the number of snails. We have 6 snails initially, so there are still 6 snails left after the additional 3 chickens arrive. Therefore, there are more chickens than snails on the fence. The correct answer is 8 - 6 = 2 more chickens than snails.
Response:  We know that there are 4 chickens and 6 snails sitting on the fence. If we add 2 more chickens, then the total number of birds (chickens + cows) will be 6 + 2 = 8. So, there are 7 snails sitting on the fence (6 original + 1 new).
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 turtles sitting on the fence initially. Then, 6 more cows arrive. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 animals sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that there are 6 chickens and 3 ostriches sitting on the fence.  Two goats have already arrived to join them. So, in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds (not including the goats). Therefore, more than 8 ducks are sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 4 con chim và 3 con chim ốc already sitting on the fence.  So, in total, we have 7 con chim (4 + 3). Now, let's consider the additional 6 con chim cừu that have arrived. Since they are more than the number of con chim ốc already sitting on the fence, we can conclude that there are now more con chim cừu than con chim ốc on the fence. Therefore, the answer is: More than 7 con chim cừu.
Response:  We know that there are 6 chickens sitting on the fence. Then, we have 4 more chickens and 8 more snails coming to join them. So, in total, there are 6 + 4 = 10 chickens sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 5 birds sitting on the fence and 4 snails have also come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 + 4 = 9 creatures sitting on the fence. Since hawk is more than duck, we can say that there are at least 10 creatures (including the hawk) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens already sitting on the fence post.  Then, we have 2 more chickens coming to join them, so the total number of chickens is now 5 (3 + 2). Next, we have 6 oysters coming to join them as well, so the total number of creatures on the fence post is now 11 (5 + 6). Finally, we have 2 dogs joining them, so the total number of creatures on the fence post is now 13 (11 + 2). Therefore, there are more than 3 chickens on the fence post. The correct answer is 13 - 3 = 10.
Response:  We know that there are 5 deer and 3 birds sitting on the fence.  If 4 more birds come to join them, then the total number of birds is now 7 (5 + 3 + 4). So, there are more than 5 deer if we add the new birds to the original ones. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that there are 6 goats and 2 dogs sitting on the fence.  If 3 more birds come to join them, then the total number of birds is now 3 + 2 = 5. So, there are 5 birds more than goats sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 6 (goats) - 5 (birds) = 1.
Response:  We know that there are 3 chickens sitting on the fence post.  Then, we have 6 cows and 2 other birds (not specified). So, in total, we have 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds. Since chickens outnumber cows, there must be more chickens than cows. Therefore, the answer is 11 - 6 = 5 chickens more than cows.
"Response:  We know that chapter one has 48 pages and chapter two has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages chapter one has than chapter two, we can subtract the number of pages in chapter two from the number of pages in chapter one:

Number of pages in chapter one = 48
Number of pages in chapter two = 11
Difference between chapters = Number of pages in chapter one - Number of pages in chapter two
= 48 - 11
= 37
Therefore, chapter one has 37 more pages than chapter two."
"Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:

Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43

So, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter."
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has a total of 93 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 = 60 + x (where x is the number of pages in Chapter 2) Chapter 2 = 93 - x Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies both equations simultaneously. Solving for 'x', we get: x = 31 Therefore, there are 31 pages in Chapter 2.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and chapter 2 is 36 pages long, we can calculate the number of pages in chapter 1 as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Therefore, if the total number of pages in the book is 67 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in Chapter 1 as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages So, there are 31 pages in Chapter 1.
"Response:  The first chapter has 66 pages, and each subsequent chapter has fewer pages than the previous one. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows:
Total pages = 66 + (35 / 2) + (24 / 2)
= 66 + 17.5 + 12
= 95 pages
So, there are 95 pages in the book."
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get 91 + 23 = 114 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter by 114 - 23 = 91 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and the second chapter has 18 pages less than that (since it is shorter). So, the second chapter has 35 - 18 = 17 pages. Now, we know that the third chapter has only 3 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 17 + 3 = 20 pages. Therefore, the answer to the question is 20 pages.
Response:  We know that chapter 1 has 53 pages and chapter 3 has 21 pages. So we can calculate the number of pages in chapter 2 as follows: Chapter 2 = (53 + 75) / 2 = 64 pages. Therefore, chapter 1 has more pages than chapter 3.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages
"Response:  Since there are 2 chapters and each chapter has 23 pages in total, we can calculate the number of pages for each chapter as follows:
Chapter 1: 10 pages x 2 = 20 pages
Chapter 2: 23 pages - 10 pages = 13 pages
Therefore, Chapter 1 has 20 pages, and Chapter 2 has 13 pages."
"Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in total and each chapter has x pages. Since Chapter 1 has 81 pages, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 68 = 81
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 81 - 68
x = 13
So, Chapter 2 has 13 pages."
"Response:  At dawn, there are 62 people rowing boats. In the afternoon, there are 39 people rowing boats. To find out how many more people went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of people who went fishing in the afternoon from the number of people who went fishing in the morning:

More = 62 - 39 = 23
So, there were 23 more people who went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  At dawn (buổi sáng), there are 52 people going kayaking.  In the afternoon (buổi chiều), there are 61 people going kayaking. So, the difference between the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon and those who went kayaking in the morning is:  61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, 9 more people went kayaking in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 people who go fishing in the morning and some more people go fishing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Morning = 15 + (Afternoon - 15) Where A is the number of people who go fishing in the afternoon. Now, we have to find out how many people go fishing in the afternoon. From the question, we know that ""Người khác đi chèo thuyền vào buổi chiều"". This means that some other people go fishing in the afternoon. So, we can substitute this value into our equation as follows: Afternoon = 15 + (Afternoon - 15) Substituting this value into our original equation, we get: Morning = 15 + (Afternoon - 15) = 15 + (X - 15) where X is the total number of people who go fishing on that day. Solving for X, we get: X = 32 Therefore, there are 32 people who go fishing on that day, including both those who went in the morning and those who went in the afternoon."
Response:  If some people go fishing in the morning and 7 more people go fishing in the afternoon, then the total number of people who went fishing that day is 60.  To find out how many people went fishing in the morning, we can divide the total number of people by 2 (since there are two periods). So, the number of people who went fishing in the morning is 30.
Response:  At sunrise (07:00), 36 people go kayaking.  At noon (12:00), 13 more people go kayaking.  And at dusk (18:00), another 49 people go kayaking. Therefore, there are a total of 36 + 13 + 49 = 98 people who went kayaking during the day.
Response:  At sunrise, there are 44 people rowing boats. Then, at noon, there are 39 people rowing boats. Finally, at dusk, there are 31 people rowing boats. So, we have: 44 - 39 = 5 more people rowing boats during the day than in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 53 people who go kayaking in the morning, and 48 people who go kayaking in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who go kayaking is: 53 + 48 = 101 people. Now, we need to find out how many more people go kayaking in the evening than in the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who go kayaking in the morning from the number of people who go kayaking in the evening: 101 - 53 = 48 people. Therefore, there are 48 more people who go kayaking in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  At sunrise, there are 33 people going for kayaking. Then at noon, there are 34 more people joining in, making it 67 total (including those who went earlier). Finally, at dusk, there are 10 additional people participating, bringing the total number of kayakers to 77. So, the difference between the number of people kayaking during the day and those kayaking at night is 77 - 67 = 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 people who go kayaking in the morning and 21 people who go kayaking in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of people who go kayaking is:

13 + 21 = 34

So, there are 34 people who go kayaking in the camp."
Response:  At dawn (buổi sáng), there are 29 people rowing and 66 people walking long distance. In the afternoon (buổi chiều), there are 26 people rowing. To find out how many more people went for a boat ride in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of people who went for a boat ride in the afternoon from the total number of people who went for a boat ride in the morning:  Number of people who went for a boat ride in the morning - Number of people who went for a boat ride in the afternoon = 29 - 26 = 3 Therefore, there were 3 more people who went for a boat ride in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that there are 41 people who go kayaking in the morning and 26 people who go kayaking in the afternoon. So, altogether we have: 41 + 26 = 67 people who go kayaking. Now, let's find out how many people go hiking. According to the question, there are 4 people who go hiking. Therefore, the final answer is: 67 (kayakers) + 4 (hikers) = 71 people.
Response:  If there are 43 people who go fishing in the morning and some more people go fishing in the afternoon, then we can say that the total number of people going fishing is equal to 43 + x, where x is the number of people who went fishing in the afternoon. Since the total number of people going fishing is given as 46, we can set up the equation: 43 + x = 46. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, three people went fishing in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were originally 7 apples on the tree, then we can subtract the number of apples she picked from the total number of apples on the tree to find out how many apples are left on the tree. So, the answer is:  $3$ apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some of them and now has 2 apples left on the tree. So, she took away x apples from the total number of apples she initially had (where x is the number of apples she picked). Therefore, the number of apples Rachel initially had = 4.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and now there are only 5 left on the tree. Of these 5 apples, 3 have already turned red (chosen by Rachel) and 2 are still green. So, the number of green apples left on the tree is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 apples left on the tree that haven't yet turned red.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 2 ripe apples from the tree and there are now 7 apples left on the tree. If 6 of these apples were already ripe (chín) and the remaining one is not yet ripe, then the number of ripe apples on the tree at the beginning was 6 + 1 = 7. So, the tree had 7 ripe apples at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree and now there are only 2 ripe apples left on the tree. So, the total number of apples on the tree is 2 + 6 = 8 apples. Therefore, the answer is 8 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree and left 27 unripe ones. So, initially there were 3 + 27 = 30 apples on the tree. Now, we are asked how many ripe apples are left on the tree after Rachel took 3 more. Therefore, the number of ripe apples left on the tree is 30 - 3 = 27.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and then 2 new apples grew on the same tree. So, now there are 6 apples left on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples on the tree is 6.
Response:  Initially, there are 2 apples on Rachel's tree. She picks 4 apples from her tree, leaving 2 apples remaining. Then, 3 new apples grow on the tree, bringing the total number of apples to 5 (2 + 3). Therefore, there are 5 apples on Rachel's tree now.
Response:  If Rachel picked 2 apples from one of her trees and now there are 7 apples left on that tree, then we can say that the number of apples on that tree is equal to 7 - 2 = 5. So, the other 4 trees must have 5 apples each. Therefore, the total number of apples Rachel has is 5 x 4 = 20 apples.
Response:  If Rachel has 3 apple trees and she picks 8 apples from each tree, then she will have 3 x 8 = 24 apples in total. Now, if she takes 5 apples from one of the trees, there will be 24 - 5 = 19 apples left on that tree. Similarly, if she takes 3 apples from the second tree, there will be 24 - 3 = 21 apples left on that tree. And if she takes 2 apples from the third tree, there will be 24 - 2 = 22 apples left on that tree. Therefore, the total number of apples Rachel has after taking some from all three trees is 19 + 21 + 22 = 62 apples. So, the answer is 62.
Response:  If Rachel picked 7 quails from each of her 4 trees, she would have collected 7 x 4 = 28 quails in total. Since there were still 29 quails left on the trees after she picked them, that means she didn't pick all 29 quails. So, the number of quails Rachel picked is equal to 28 - 29 = -1 quail. Therefore, Rachel picked no quails.
Response:  We know that Ed has 2 more bullets than Doug initially. So, if Ed had x bullets and Doug had x - 2 bullets, then after losing some bullets, Ed would have x + 19 bullets and Doug would have x - 38 bullets. Therefore, Doug lost 38 bullets.
Response:  We know that Ed has more bullets than Doug because he lost fewer balls in the game. So, if Ed had 45 bullets and lost 3 balls, then he would have 42 remaining bullets (45 - 3 = 42).  Now we need to find out how many bullets Doug has left after losing 11 balls. Since Doug lost 11 balls, he must have started with at least 11 + 1 = 12 bullets. Therefore, Doug has 12 - 11 = 1 bullet left.  So, Ed has 42 bullets while Doug has only 1 bullet left, which means Ed has 41 more bullets than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 6 bullets than Doug. So if Ed has 22 bullets, then he must have at least 16 bullets (since 6 is less than 22). Now we know that Doug lost 7 balls in total. Since Ed had more bullets than Doug, it means that after losing 7 balls, Doug will have fewer bullets than Ed. Therefore, Doug currently has 9 bullets (22 - 7 = 15, and since Ed has more bullets than Doug, Doug can only have a number less than or equal to Ed's current number of bullets).
Response:  We know that Ed has more than Doug because he has 5 bullets and Doug has lost 3 balls. So, if Ed has 27 bullets, then Doug must have had fewer bullets at first.  Therefore, we can conclude that Doug had 24 bullets (27 - 3 = 24) initially.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 24 bullets and less than 30 bullets.  Therefore, we can say that Ed has exactly 27 bullets (since he lost 27 bullets).  Now, let's compare this with Doug.  We know that Doug had 24 bullets initially and lost some of them.  Since Ed has 27 bullets and Doug has fewer than 27 bullets, it means that Ed has more bullets than Doug.  So, the correct answer is:  Ed has more bullets than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed has 29 balls more than Doug. So if Ed had x balls initially and Doug had x - 17 balls initially, then we can write an equation as follows:
Ed = x + 29 ( since Ed has 29 more balls than Doug)
Doug = x - 17 (since Doug has fewer balls than Ed)
Now we are given that Ed lost 17 of his balls on the field. So, we can subtract 17 from Ed's initial number of balls to get his new number of balls after losing them:
New Ed = Ed - 17
= x + 29 - 17
= x/2
Since Doug also lost some balls, let's say he lost y balls. Then, we can find out how many balls Doug has left by subtracting y from his initial number of balls:
New Doug = Doug - y
= x - 17 - y
Now we want to know how many balls Doug has compared to Ed. To do this, we divide the number of balls Doug has by the number of balls Ed has:
Ratio of balls owned by Doug to those owned by Ed = New Doug / New Ed
= (x - 17 - y) / (x/2)
Simplifying the ratio gives us:
Ratio of balls owned by Doug to those owned by Ed = (x - 34) / (x/2)
So, Doug owns approximately half as many balls as Ed does."
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 balls initially and lost some of them in the game. Now he has 8 more than Doug, which means Ed has 27 balls (8 + 19). So, Ed lost 2 balls during the game.
Response:  We know that Ed has 91 balls and he lost 21 of them on the field. So, Ed now has 91 - 21 = 70 balls left.  Now we need to find out how many more or less balls Doug has than Ed. According to the problem, Doug has 30 fewer balls than Ed. Therefore, if Ed has x balls, then Doug has x - 30 = 60 balls.  So, Ed has 70 balls more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 balls before he lost some of them at the playground. If Ed has 17 balls now, then he must have gained 5 balls (since he started with 12 and now has 17). So, Doug must have had x - 5 = 9 balls initially (where x is the number of balls Ed had before losing any). Now, we are told that Ed lost 20 balls at the playground. Therefore, Doug now has 9 + 20 = 29 balls in total.
"Response:  If 408 students suggest adding potatoes and 42 students suggest adding beef jerky to their meals, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding something = 408 + 42 = 446

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding beef jerky:

Number of students who suggested adding potatoes - Number of students who suggested adding beef jerky = 408 - 42 = 366

Therefore, there are 366 more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding beef jerky."
"Response:  If 479 students suggest adding potatoes and 489 students suggest adding beef to their meals, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding something = 479 + 489 = 968

Number of students who suggested adding beef = 489

Number of students who suggested adding potatoes = 479

So, there are more students who suggested adding beef than those who added potatoes."
Response:  Since 185 students suggested adding potatoes and only 65 suggested adding beef, we can say that 120 (185 - 65) students did not suggest adding beef. Therefore, there are 120 students who suggested adding potatoes or other ingredients to the menu.
Response:  Since there were 288 students in total, and 264 of them suggested adding meat to their meals, that means 14 students did not suggest adding any meat (or they might have suggested other food items). Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding khoai tây nghiền is 14.
Response:  If there are 457 students in total and 63 of them want to add more potatoes than those who want to add more beef, then we can say that 63/457 = X, where X is the number of students who want to add more beef. Since there are 100 students in total who want to add either potatoes or beef, we have 100 - (63 + 63) = Y, where Y is the number of students who want to add neither potatoes nor beef. So, the final answer is Y.
"Response:  If 182 students suggested adding potatoes and 166 students suggested adding beef, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding beef. So, we can say that $x$ (the number of students who suggested adding beef) is less than $y$ (the number of students who suggested adding potatoes).  Now, we have two equations based on the information given in the question:

$$\begin{aligned}
x + y &= 166 \\
x < y
\end{aligned}$$
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

$$y = 104$$
So, there are 104 students who suggested adding beef to their meals."
Response:  If 324 students suggest adding potatoes and 128 students suggest adding carrots to their meals, then there are a total of 452 suggestions (324 + 128). Since each student can only suggest one additional ingredient, the number of unique suggestions is 452 / 3 = 150. Therefore, 150 students participated in suggesting new ingredients for their meals.
Response:  If 257 students proposed adding potatoes to their menu and 97 of them proposed adding pickles, then we can say that among those who proposed adding potatoes, 36 (257 - 97) more students proposed adding pickles than those who did not propose adding potatoes. Therefore, the number of students who proposed adding pickles is 36 + 97 = 133.
Response:  If 144 students suggest adding potatoes and 79 students suggest adding pickles to their menu, then there are 223 students (144 + 79) who do not suggest adding either of those ingredients to their menu. Therefore, among the remaining 223 students, the number of students who suggest adding potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggest adding pickles.
Response:  If 228 students suggest adding potatoes and 337 students suggest adding beef to their menu, then there are 565 (228 + 337) students in total who have suggested adding one of these two ingredients.  Since 23 students have suggested adding cucumber, we can subtract that number from the total number of students who have suggested adding an ingredient to get the number of students who have suggested adding beef more than those who have suggested adding cucumber. Therefore, the answer is 542 (565 - 23).
"Response:  If 450 students participate in the survey and request additional dishes, then there are 450 possible combinations of dishes that can be requested. Since 38 students request additional pork, we have to subtract 38 from the total number of combinations. Therefore, the remaining number of combinations is:
$$ \boxed{412} $$
So, $412$ students participated in the survey and requested additional dishes."
Response:  If 218 students suggest adding potatoes and 351 students suggest adding only smoked meat to their meals, then we can calculate the number of students who suggested adding both potatoes and smoked meat as follows: Number of students suggesting both = Total number of students - Number of students suggesting only one ingredient (potatoes or smoked meat) So, in this case, the total number of students is 579 (since there are 218 + 351 students), and therefore the number of students suggesting both potatoes and smoked meat is: Number of students suggesting both = 579 - (218 + 351) = 579 - 569 = 10 Students have suggested both potatoes and smoked meat.
Response:  If 269 students suggest adding beef to their menu and 76 students suggest adding cabbage, then there are more students who want beef than those who want cabbage. Therefore, among all the students, there are more than twice as many students who want beef as there are students who want cabbage.
"Response:  The number of girls in the school is 569 and the number of boys is 236. To find out how many more girls there are than boys, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls:

569 - 236 = 333

So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls:  Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.67 (round to nearest whole number) So, there are approximately 26 more boys than girls in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school. Of those, 232 are girls and 253 are boys (since ""nam"" means ""boys""). So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 485 - 232  Number of boys = 253 Therefore, there are 253 boy students at the school."
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more than boys in the school, then the number of boys is equal to 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 635 girls and 510 boys in the school, then the number of boys is 510 - 635 = -425. Since there are more boys than girls, we can say that the number of boys exceeds the number of girls by at least 425. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is greater than or equal to 425.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 587 boys in the school, then the number of boys is less than the number of girls by 281 - 587 = -306. Therefore, there must be at least 306 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in the school and 142 boys who are younger than them. So, we need to find out how many students are in total at the school. To do this, we can multiply the number of girls by the ratio of girls to boys:  Number of girls = 700 x (700 / 142) = 5360. Therefore, there are 5360 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 706 girls in the school already. Then, 418 new girls join the school, so the total number of girls is now:  706 + 418 = 1124 girls.  Therefore, there are 1124 girls in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are already 902 girls in the school before 44 new girls join. So, the total number of girls in the school is 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls in the school initially and then 465 new girls join the school. So, the total number of girls in the school now is: 632 + 465 = 1097. Now we need to find out how many boys are in the school. According to the question, there are 410 boys in the school initially. Therefore, the ratio of girls to boys in the school is: 1097 (girls) : 410 (boys) = 2.68:1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 732 girls in total and 682 of them have already joined the school. So, the number of remaining girls is equal to the total number of girls minus the number of girls who have already joined = 732 - 682 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 girls left in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in total. So, if 496 girls join the school, then the number of girls will increase to 496 + 135 = 631. Similarly, if 910 boys join the school, then the number of boys will increase to 214 + 910 = 1124. Therefore, there are currently 631 girls and 1124 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. If we add both numbers together, we get 626 students in total (308 + 318 = 626). Since there are 36 teachers at the school, the number of students per teacher is 626 / 36 = 17.5. So, there are approximately 18 students per teacher in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, together they make up 624 students (315 + 309 = 624). Now we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in total at the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers at the school. Therefore, the total number of people at the school is 624 students + 772 teachers = 1396.
Response:  If there are 402 girls in the school and they have more than boys, then we can say that for every girl, there is at least one boy. So, if there are x boys in the school, then the number of girls must be greater than or equal to x + 1 (since each girl has at least one boy). Now, if there are 739 girls in total, then the number of boys cannot exceed 738 (since there are only 402 girls who have more than boys). Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 738.
Response:  If there are 458 girls in the school and 692 more girls join, then the total number of students in the school is: Total Number of Students = Number of Girls x (Initial Number of Boys + Additional Number of Girls) = 458 x (692 + 0) = 317,600 So, there are approximately 317,600 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys in the school and 257 girls. So, the total number of students is 362 + 257 = 619. Now, we have 403 new girls joining the school. Therefore, the total number of girls in the school after they join is 403 + 257 = 660. Since the total number of girls (660) is greater than the total number of boys (619), the number of girls in the school exceeds the number of boys by 41 (660 - 619).
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $2 left ($18 - $16).
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $13 and spent some money. Then he had $3 left. So, Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Edward had $9 before he spent any money. Then, he spent $8 more, so he has $9 + $8 = $17 now. So, Edward had $6 before he spent all of his money ($9 - $6 = $3).
Response:  Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so he had $16 - $92 = -$76 left before he ran out of money. Since he now has $6, we can deduce that he initially had $6 + (-$76) = $82. Therefore, Edward had $82 before he ran out of money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so each book cost $3. Since he had $12 left after buying the books, we can conclude that each book costs $4. Therefore, the answer is $4 per book.
Response:  Firstly, Edward spent $6 to buy a book and $16 to buy a pen, so he had $22 left after that ($19 + $3). Therefore, Edward had $22 before he spent his last $7.
Response:  Edward spent $4 to buy a book and $3 to buy a pen. So he has $12 left after buying those things. To find out how much he spent on each item, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($12) by the cost of each item: $4 / $4 = 1 for the book, and $3 / $3 = 1 for the pen. Therefore, Edward spent $1 on the book and $1 on the pen.
Response:  Firstly, Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he had $19 left after buying both of them. To find out how much he spent on books compared to pens, we can divide the amount he spent on books ($16) by the amount he spent on pens ($8). This gives us a ratio of $16 / $8 = 2. Therefore, Edward spent twice as much money on books than he did on pens.
Response:  Firstly, Edward had $17 and then he spent $10 to buy something from you. So now he has $7 left. Therefore, Edward had $24 before spending any money ($17 + $7).
Response:  We know that Zachary has taped 44 times in class today and David has tapped more than him. So, we can say that David has tapped at least 44 + 1 = 45 times. Therefore, Zachary and David have tapped 45 times altogether.
Response:  We know that Zachary has taped 51 times and David has taped 44 times. To find out who has taped more, we need to subtract David's number of taps from Zachary's number of taps. So, the difference between their numbers is: 51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Zachary has tapped more than David by 7 times.
Response:  We know that David has done 44 push-ups in class today and he did more than Zachary who did 9 push-ups. So we can say that Zachary did x push-ups where x is less than or equal to 44 - 9 = 35. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David has done 51 push-ups in total today and he did more than Zachary (Zachary did 49 push-ups). So, we can say that David did at least 49 + 51 = 90 push-ups altogether. Therefore, the answer is 90.
"Response:  We know that David has done more than 19 times of push-ups and less than 59 times. So, there must be some number between 19 and 59. Let's call it x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
x + 44 = 59 (since David did 44 push-ups)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 59 - 44 = 15
So, David has done 15 push-ups."
Response:  We know that David did more than Zachary in terms of number of push-ups (29 vs 17). However, we also know that David did fewer squats than Zachary (13 vs 44). So, to find out how many times David tapped his feet during class today, we need to subtract the number of squats he did from the total number of exercises he performed. Therefore, the answer is:  David tapped his feet 29 - 13 = 16 times during class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 push-ups and 14 squats in one class today. David has done more than Zachary in terms of push-ups (17 vs 14), but fewer squats (10 vs 14). So, to find out how many times Zachary did each exercise, we can use the following formulas: Number of push-ups = Total number of push-ups / Number of classes per week x Number of weeks Since there are 53 push-ups in total, if we divide it by 3 classes per week (assuming 1 class per day) and 8 weeks, then Zachary did 17.67 push-ups per week (round up to 18 push-ups per week). Number of squats = Total number of squats / Number of classes per week x Number of weeks Similarly, if we divide 14 squats by 3 classes per week and 8 weeks, then Zachary did 4.29 squats per week (round down to 4 squats per week). Therefore, Zachary performed 18 push-ups and 4 squats in total during his fitness class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 35 push-ups and 3 squats in class today. David has done more than 58 push-ups but fewer than 87 push-ups. So we can say that Zachary has done at least 87 - 35 = 52 push-ups more than David. Therefore, Zachary has done 52 + 3 = 55 push-ups more than David.
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 46 push-ups and 58 squats in one class today.  David has done 38 push-ups more than Zachary but 62 squats fewer than Zachary. So we can write an equation as follows:
Zachary's total number of exercises = 46 + 58 (push-ups) + 58 (squats)
David's total number of exercises = 38 + 58 (push-ups) - 62 (squats)
Now let's solve for Zachary's total number of squats:
Zachary's total number of squats = 46 + 58 + 58 = 162
So Zachary has done 162 squats in one class today."
Response:  We know that David has done more push-ups than Zachary because he did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x + 39 push-ups.  Since John did fewer push-ups than David, we can say that John did x - 13 push-ups. Therefore, David did x + 39 = y push-ups. Solving for x, we get x = 26. So, David did 26 push-ups more than Zachary.
"Response:  We know that:
Zachary has tapped 51 times today.
David has tapped more than Zachary (22 - 51 = -30).
John has tapped fewer times than David (-4 = 36).
So, John has tapped exactly 36 times today."
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 15 push-ups in class today and David has done 39 more than Zachary. So, David has done 54 push-ups (39 + 15). Now we are told that John has done fewer pull-ups than David. This means that John has done x push-ups less than David. Therefore, the number of push-ups Zachary did is equal to x plus 54. In other words, Zachary did 54 + x push-ups in total.
Response:  We know that David has done more than Zachary in one session of exercise. So if David did 30 times, then Zachary did fewer than 30 times.  If David did 37 times, then Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 times. Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response:  We know that David has done more push-ups than Zachary in class today. If David did 56 push-ups, then Zachary did fewer than 56 push-ups. So, we can say that Zachary did x push-ups, where x is less than or equal to 56. Now, we are also given that David did 38 sit-ups. Since sit-ups and push-ups are equivalent, if David did 38 sit-ups, then Zachary did fewer than 38 sit-ups. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 38 = 56
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 18
So, Zachary did 18 push-ups or sit-ups in class today."
Response:  We know that David has done 40 push-ups and fewer than 17 times as many as Zachary in class today. So if Zachary did 34 push-ups, then David did __________ push-ups.  Therefore, the answer is 34 + 17 = 51.
Response:  We know that David has done 36 push-ups and fewer than 33 push-ups compared to Zachary in class today. So if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then Zachary did how many more push-ups than crunches?  To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the question to set up an equation. Let D represent the number of push-ups done by David and Z represent the number of push-ups done by Zachary. Based on the question, we know that D < 33 (David did fewer than 33 push-ups). Also, we know that Z > 58 (Zachary did more than 58 push-ups). Therefore, we can write the following inequality: D < 33 ≤ Z > 58 This means that David did fewer than 33 push-ups and Zachary did more than 58 push-ups. Now, let's find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than crunches. According to the question, Zachary did 33 crunches. So, we can subtract the number of crunches from the total number of exercises to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did: Z - 33 = 25 (since 58 - 33 = 25) Therefore, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches.
Response:  We know that David has done more than 27 times of push-ups and less than 7 times of sit-ups compared to Zachary in class today. So we can say that David did x push-ups and y sit-ups, where x > 27 and y < 7. Now we are given that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 sit-ups. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + y = 5 (Zachary did 5 push-ups) and xy < 7 (David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 30 and y = 4. So David did 30 push-ups and 4 sit-ups more than Zachary in class today.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Rachel has completed 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, the total number of pages she has completed is 5 + 2 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel has more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework (7 - 2 = 5 pages).
Response:  We know that Rachel has to do 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, in total, she has to do 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework. Therefore, Rachel has more pages of reading comprehension homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math worksheets and more than 5 pages of reading comprehension worksheets at home, then she needs to complete a total of 7 pages of worksheets. Therefore, she needs to complete 2 pages (7 - 5) of reading comprehension worksheets at home.
Response:  If Rachel has already completed 7 pages of math homework and needs to complete an additional 4 pages more than her math homework, then she needs to complete 11 pages (7 + 4) of reading homework. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  If Rachel has already completed 8 pages of math homework and needs to complete an additional 3 pages beyond her reading comprehension homework, then she needs to complete a total of 11 pages (8 + 3 = 11).
"Response:  If Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and she reads more than one page of reading homework for each page of math homework, then we can say that she reads x pages of reading homework. Since there are 6 pages of reading homework in total, we have the equation:
x = 6 - 8
Solving for x, we get:
x = -2
So, Rachel has to complete 2 pages of reading homework less than the number of pages of math homework she has to complete."
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 10 pages of homework in total, and she spends more time reading than doing math problems, then we can assume that for every page of math problems she completes, she spends x amount of time reading.  So if she spends y minutes reading, then she will spend (10 - 3) \* y = 70 minutes on math problems. Therefore, Rachel will take 70 minutes to complete her math homework.
Response:  For math, she has to do 2 pages of exercises, so that's 2 x 4 = 8 pages.  For reading, she has to read 3 books, and each book is 20 pages long, so that's 3 x 20 = 60 pages.  And for science, she has to do 10 experiments, and each experiment takes 2 pages, so that's 10 x 2 = 20 pages.  Therefore, in total, Rachel has to write 8 + 60 + 20 = 98 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, she has to do 9 + 2 = 11 pages of homework in total. Now, we are asked how many pages of math homework Rachel has to do more than her reading comprehension homework. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension homework from the total number of pages of homework. Therefore, 11 - 2 = 9 pages of math homework that Rachel has to do more than her reading comprehension homework.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Rachel has to do 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. She also has to do 3 pages of science homework. So, the total number of pages she has to do is:

Math homework = 11 pages
Reading comprehension = 2 pages
Science homework = 3 pages
Total pages = Math + Reading + Science = 11 + 2 + 3 = 16 pages
Therefore, Rachel has more math homework than reading comprehension homework."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Rachel has completed 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she has completed more pages of reading comprehension than math homework. So, the number of pages of reading comprehension that Rachel has completed is 11 - 7 = 4 pages more than the number of pages of math homework she has completed.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of math worksheets and 11 pages of reading comprehension worksheets.  Therefore, she needs to complete 9 + 11 = 20 pages of work in total.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel has to do 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension. Since each page is equal to 1/4 of a notebook, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:
Math homework: 8 pages \* 1/4 = 2 notebooks
Reading comprehension: 7 pages \* 1/4 = 1 1/2 notebooks
Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 2 + 1 1/2 = 3 1/2 notebooks worth of work."
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math worksheets and 6 pages of science worksheets. Since each page contains 2 problems, we can calculate the total number of problems as follows:
Math worksheets: 5 pages x 2 problems/page = 10 problems
Science worksheets: 6 pages x 2 problems/page = 12 problems
Therefore, Rachel has to solve a total of 10 + 12 = 22 problems."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to do 2 more pages of reading comprehension and 4 more pages of math problems than she did at home. So, if she did 5 pages of reading comprehension and 3 pages of math problems at home, then she will have to do an additional 7 pages (2 + 4 = 7) of each subject. Therefore, Rachel has to do a total of 12 pages (5 + 7 = 12) more work than she did at home.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has completed 4 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she has completed for math and reading is:

Math homework: 4 pages - Reading homework: 7 pages = 3 pages

So, Rachel has completed more pages of math homework than reading homework."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning emails = 6 Afternoon emails + 2 Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Morning emails = 6 (2) + 2 = 12 Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon. The difference between the number of emails he received in the two periods is 12 - 2 = 10.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Morning emails = 6
Afternoon emails = 8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, Jack received more than 2 emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more emails later in the day, then he received a total of 4 + x emails that day, where x is the number of additional emails he received after noon. Since we are told that Jack received 5 emails that day, we can set up the equation:  4 + x = 5. Solving for x, we get:  x = 1. So Jack received 5 emails that day, including the ones he received in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). However, we are also given that he received 5 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails Jack received is 9 + 5 = 14 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon for a total of 13 emails.  Now we are asked how many emails he will receive today. Since it is already evening, we can assume that Jack will not receive any more emails today, so the answer is 0. Therefore, the number of emails Jack will receive today is 0.
Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the evening. According to the question, Jack received 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, the final answer is:  9 + 8 = 17 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 7 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the evening. According to the question, Jack received 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, the final answer is:  Emails received by Jack = 7 + 8 = 15.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 10 + Evening. Now, we are given that Jack received 17 emails in the evening. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation: 17 = 10 + x, where x is the number of emails Jack received in the morning. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did in the evening (by 3 emails).
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 9 Emails Evening = 7 Emails Now, let's compare the number of emails he received in each time period: Morning + Evening = Total Number of Emails Therefore, we have: 9 + 7 = 16 Emails Jack received more emails during the day than at night. The difference between these two numbers is equal to 7 - 9 = -2 emails. So, Jack received -2 emails fewer during the night than during the day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received is:  10 + 5 = 15 emails. Now we need to find out how many more emails Jack received in the afternoon than in the evening. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the afternoon:  15 - 4 = 11 emails. Therefore, Jack received 11 more emails during the afternoon than during the evening.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 9 emails so far.  If he receives additional emails later in the day, we can calculate them separately. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 9 - 3 = 6.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So in total, he received 3 + 64 = 67 messages.  Then in the afternoon, Jack received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, in total, he received 5 + 54 = 69 messages that day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. So in total, he received 5 + 6 = 11 messages.  In the afternoon, Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters. So in total, he received 9 + 7 = 16 messages. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 messages in one day.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So in total, he received 10 + 12 = 22 messages at morning.  In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So in total, he received 3 + 44 = 47 messages at afternoon. Therefore, Jack received more messages at afternoon than at morning (47 - 22 = 25).
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. Then he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 letters during the day. Therefore, Jack received more letters in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. This means he received 91 - 6 = 85 emails in the morning.  In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and sent 74 letters. Therefore, he received 2 + 85 = 87 emails in total that day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So he received 4 + 2 = 6 emails in total during the morning. Then, in the afternoon, he received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters. Therefore, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 emails in total during the day.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and another 2 emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 + 2 = 9 emails that day. So, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 16 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails he received is:  3 + 16 = 19 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails during the evening than during the afternoon (by 16 - 3 = 13 emails).
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 9 emails during the day. Since we are asked about the number of emails he received in the afternoon, we can conclude that he did not receive any more emails after 3 pm. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 3.
Response:  The length of the jump made by the fox is 9 inches and that of the frog is 12 inches. So, we can say that the distance traveled by the frog during its jump is equal to the distance traveled by the fox plus twice the height of the frog (since it jumps from ground level). Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog = 9 + 2(12) = 36 inches. Since the frog travels farther than the fox, the correct answer is A - 36 inches.
Response:  Since con báo and con ếch are both jumping at the same time, we can say that their jumps are equal. So, if con báo jumps 31 inches, then con ếch jumps 35 inches. Therefore, they have jumped a total of 66 inches (31 + 35).
Response:  We know that con báo can jump 36 inches and con ếch jumps more than con chuột (which is 15 inches). So we can say that con ếch jumps at least 36 + 15 = 51 inches. Therefore, con ếch nhảy bao xa 51 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that con báo can jump 25 inches. Secondly, we know that con ếch jumps farther than con chuột, which means it jumps 18 inches more than con chuột. Finally, we know that con chuột jumps 2 inches less than con ếch. Therefore, the distance that con chuột can jump is 18 - 2 = 16 inches.
"Response:  We know that:
Con báo nhảy 30 cm (or 30 inches)
Con ếch nhảy xa hơn con chồn 10 inch (or 25 cm)
Con chuột nhảy xa hơn con ếch 20 inch (or 46 cm)
From the information given above, we can set up an equation as follows:
Con chuột - Con ếch = Con báo + Con chồn
Substituting the values we have obtained from the problem, we get:
Con chuột - Con ếch = 30 + 25 + 46
Solving for ""Con chuột"", we find that it is equal to:
Con chuột = 71 inch
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Con chuột nhảy xa hơn thỏ dại bao nhiêu? = 71 inch"
"Response:  We know that:
Con báo = 30 cm (from the question)
Con ếch = more than 39 inches (from the question)
Con chuột = less than 94 inches (from the question)
We can start by converting all measurements to the same unit of measurement, such as feet or meters. For example, we could convert 30 cm to feet by dividing it by 12, since there are 12 inches in 1 foot:
30 cm / 12 = 2.5 ft (round up to the nearest whole number)
Now, let's use this conversion factor to calculate how far con ếch jumped:
Con ếch = more than 39 in + 2.5 ft =?
To solve for, we need to add 39 inches and 2.5 feet:
39 in + 2.5 ft = 39 + 2.5 = 41.5 ft
So, con ếch jumped 41.5 feet!"
Response:  Firstly, we know that con báo can jump 25 inches. Secondly, we know that con ếch jumps farther than con chuột, which means it jumps 32 inches more than con chuột. Finally, we know that con chuột jumps shorter than con ếch by 26 inches. Therefore, the distance that con chuột jumps is equal to 26 - 32 = -6 inches. So, con chuột jumps -6 inches.
"Response:  We know that:
Con báo can jump 24 inches (60 cm).
Con ếch can jump more than con chuột by 33 inches (84 cm).
Con chuột can jump less than con ếch by 5 inches (13 cm).
So, we have two equations:
Con báo + con ếch = 33 inches (84 cm)... (1)
Con báo - con chuột = 5 inches (13 cm)... (2)
Now, let's solve for ""how much"" con chuột jumps: Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
Con báo + con ếch = 33 inches (84 cm)... (1)
Con báo - con chuột = 5 inches (13 cm)... (2)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):
Con báo + con ếch = 33 inches (84 cm)... (1)
Con báo - con chuột = 38 inches (97 cm)... (2)
Therefore, con chuột jumps 38 inches (97 cm)."
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the fox is 13 inches and it jumps over the snake which is 2 inches longer than itself. So, the total distance traveled by the fox after jumping over the snake will be: Distance = 13 + (2 * 9) = 25 inches. Therefore, the length of the snake is 25 - 13 = 12 inches.
Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the fox is 35 inches and it jumps over an area of 4 inches more than its own length. So, we can write the equation as follows: Length of fox's jump = 35 inches + (4 inches / 12) = 39 inches. Therefore, the distance traveled by the fox during its jump is 39 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that con báo can jump 30 cm (since it is given). Then, con chuột jumps downward and lands below con ếch. So, con ếch moves upward by 4 inches (or 10 cm) after being landed upon by con chuột. Therefore, the distance traveled by con ếch is equal to its initial height plus the distance it moved upward after landing = 20 cm + 10 cm = 30 cm. Thus, con ếch nhảy bao xa 30 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that con báo can jump 39 inches. Secondly, we know that con chuột jumps farther than con ếch by 19 inches. Thirdly, we know that con chuột jumps shorter than con ếch by 12 inches. So, if con chuột jumps X inches, then it will be between 39 and 51 inches (since con ếch can only jump up to 40 inches). Therefore, con chuột jumps 46 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that con báo can jump 21 inches. Secondly, we know that con chuột jumps more than con ếch but less than con báo. So, if con chuột jumps 25 inches, then con ếch jumps less than 25 inches (but not less than 16 inches). Finally, we know that con chuột jumps less than con báo. Therefore, the distance between con chuột and con báo is greater than the sum of their individual jumps. Hence, con chuột jumps 37 inches (25 + 16) away from con báo.
Response:  Since con ếch nhảy 39 inches and con báo nhảy 17 inches, we can say that their total distance traveled is equal to the sum of their individual distances. So, for con ếch, its distance traveled = 39 inches. For con báo, its distance traveled = 17 inches. Now, let's find out how much more con ếch traveled than con báo. We do this by subtracting con báo's distance from con ếch's distance: Distance traveled by con ếch - Distance traveled by con báo = 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, con ếch traveled 22 inches farther than con báo.
Response:  Since con báo can jump 9 inches, we know that its height is equal to or greater than 9 inches. Similarly, since ếch can jump more than 3 inches, we know that its height is also equal to or greater than 3 inches. Now, let's find out how far chuột can jump. We are told that it jumps less than 3 inches compared to ếch. So, if ếch jumps x feet, then chuột jumps x - 3 feet. Therefore, the distance traveled by chuột during its jump is given by: Distance = x - 3 feet. Substituting this value into the equation for the total distance traveled (given earlier), we get: Total distance = x - 3 + 33 = x + 26 feet. Therefore, the distance traveled by chuột during its jump is 26 feet.
"Response: 
Con báo nhảy 45 cm = 18 inches (since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches)
Chuột nhảy 16 inch = 16/12 = 1.33 feet
ECho nhảy 37 inch = 37/12 = 3 feet
So, chuột nhảy xa hơn thỏ dại by 0.67 feet or 8 inches. Therefore, the answer is 8 inches."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the mixture so far. To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required (14 cups - 5 cups = 9 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs to add more than 4 cups of sugar. So, we can start with adding 5 cups of sugar (since 11 - 4 = 7). Now, let's calculate how much flour is left after adding 5 cups of sugar: 9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour remaining. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 cups of sugar (5 + 2 = 7) to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already used some flour and needs more to make 8 additional cups of dough. So, we need to find out how many cups of flour she will need if she wants to make 8 more cups of dough after using some flour.  To do this, we can use the ratio of flour to water in the recipe. According to the question, the ratio is 6 cups of flour to 13 cups of water. Therefore, if Mary uses x cups of flour, she will need (13 - x) cups of water to make 8 additional cups of dough.  Now, let's substitute the value of x into the equation. Since Mary has already used some flour, we can assume that x is less than or equal to the amount of flour she has already used. In other words, x ≤ y, where y is the amount of flour Mary has already used.  Using this inequality, we can rewrite the equation as follows: (13 - x) = 8.  Solving for x, we get: x = 5.  Therefore, Mary needs 5 cups of flour more to make 8 additional cups of dough.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to the mixture and now she needs 2 more cups of flour instead of sugar. So, if she had x cups of flour initially, then she will need 2x cups of flour in total. Therefore, the answer is 2x.
Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and needs to add another 6 cups, then we can calculate the total amount of flour needed as follows: Total amount of flour = Initial amount (3 cups) + Desired amount (6 cups) Total amount of flour = 3 + 6 = 9 cups So, the correct answer is 9 cups.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to the mixture because she asked you for ""a few cups of flour."" If she needs an additional 2 cups of flour, then she must have started with a total of x cups of flour (where x is the number of cups she needed). Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2 = 12... (1)

Now, we are also given that Mary used 5 cups of sugar in her recipe. So, if she needs an additional 2 cups of flour, then she will need to use 3 more cups of sugar (since each cup of flour requires 0.67 cups of sugar):

x + 2 = 12
3(x + 2) = 5

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, Mary started with 8 cups of flour and needs an additional 2 cups to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of water to make the dough. To find out how much more flour she needs, we can use the following formula: Number of additional cups = Total amount of flour - Amount already added / 9 (number of cups in a cup) So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of additional cups = 9 (total amount of flour) - 3 (amount already added) / 9 (number of cups in a cup) = 9 - 0.375 / 9 = 0.411 cups Therefore, Mary needs an additional 0.411 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to the mixture. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required (14 cups). So, the number of additional cups of sugar needed is:

14 - 10 = 4 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of sugar to the mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has added 11 cups of flour so far and the recipe requires 12 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour are required. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour required (12 cups) by the amount of flour Mary has already added (11 cups):

Number of additional cups = Total amount of flour required - Amount of flour added = 12 cups - 11 cups = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs an additional 1 cup of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs more flour than the amount of sugar. So we can start with the total amount of flour needed which is 10 cups - 2 cups = 8 cups. Now we need to find out how much more flour Mary needs to add to make up for the difference between the amount of flour and sugar. To do this, we divide the amount of sugar (80 cups) by the amount of flour left (8 cups). This gives us an additional 10 cups of flour needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add 10 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture so far. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required (12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 10 cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the mixture and she needs to add more flour than salt. So, we can start with the total amount of flour needed: 6 cups (flour) - 5 cups (already added) = 1 cup (remaining flour). Now, let's find out how much salt is left: 8 cups (salt) - 7 cups (already added) = 1 cup (remaining salt). Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of salt to complete the recipe.
Response:  At first, Mary had 12 cups of flour and added 2 cups of sugar. So now she has 12 + 2 = 14 cups of ingredients left to add. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of ingredients (14) by the amount of sugar she already added (2): 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, Mary needs to add 7 more cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has added 4 cups of sugar to the mixture so far. To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount of ingredients called for in the recipe. So, if the recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar, then she needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5). Therefore, the answer is 5 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture, and she needs to add more flour than sugar. So, we can start with the amount of sugar (6 cups) and subtract the amount of flour (2 cups) that Mary has already added. This means that Mary needs to add an additional 4 cups of flour (6 - 2 = 4). Therefore, the correct answer is 4 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the mixture and the recipe requires 14 cups of flour in total. So we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount required: 14 - 11 = 3 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of flour to the mixture.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the dough (she has ""chopped off"" an unknown amount of flour). If she still needs 5 more cups of flour after adding what she has already used, then we can deduce that she originally had X cups of flour. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour, we can set up the equation:
X + 3 = 10...(1)
Now, let's solve for X. We know that X is the number of cups of flour that Mary originally had, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):
X + 3 = 10
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:
X = 7...(2)
Therefore, Mary originally had 7 cups of flour in her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to the mixture because she needs 13 cups of flour in total and she has given you 5 cups so far. So, if she still needs 12 cups more, then she must have used up 8 cups (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Mary has used up 8 cups of flour so far.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of water to the mixture. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required (14 cups - 7 cups = 7 cups). So, Mary needs an additional 7 cups of flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 12 cups of water to the recipe. To find out how many more cups of water she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required in the recipe. So, the number of additional cups of water needed is:

Total amount of water required = 11 cups
Amount of water already used = 10 cups
Number of additional cups of water needed = Total amount of water required - Amount of water already used
= 11 cups - 10 cups
= 1 cup
Therefore, Mary needs an additional 1 cup of water to complete the recipe."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to the mixture. To find out how many more cups she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required. So, if we multiply the total amount of flour (3 x 10 = 30) by the proportion of flour in the recipe (15/30), we get:

Number of additional cups of flour needed = Total amount of flour required x Proportion of flour in the recipe
= 30 x 15/30
= 9 cups
Therefore, Mary needs an additional 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the mixture so far. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required (9 cups - 4 cups = 5 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the mixture so far. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required (9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cups of flour to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to the mixture, and the recipe requires 6 cups of flour. So, we need to subtract 12 - 6 = 6 more cups of flour than the amount of salt required. Since the recipe calls for 9 cups of salt, we need to add 6 / 9 = 3/4 cup more salt than the original amount. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 3/4 cup of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the mixture. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Number of remaining cups = Total amount of sugar - Amount already added / Total amount needed. In this case, the total amount of sugar is 7 cups (as stated in the problem), and the amount already added is 4 cups. So, to find out how many more cups Mary needs to add, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Number of remaining cups = 7 - 4 / 3 = 2 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 cups of sugar to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the mixture and she needs more flour than sugar. So, we can start with the amount of sugar added (10 cups) and subtract it from the total amount required (12 cups). This gives us the remaining amount of sugar needed (2 cups). Now, since we know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar, we can calculate the remaining amount of flour needed by dividing the total amount of flour required (14 cups) by the amount of sugar added (10 cups). This gives us the remaining amount of flour needed (4 cups). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 4 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain and if 60% of them migrate to warmer places during winter, then we can calculate the number of bird families that migrate as follows:

Number of bird families that migrate = Total number of bird families x Percentage of families that migrate
= 19 x 0.60
= 11.4 (approximately)
Therefore, approximately 11.4 bird families migrate to warmer places during winter."
Response:  If there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 7 families fly away for winter, then how many families of birds remain after they fly away?  Therefore, the answer is 80 (87 - 7).
Response:  We know that 20 birds have migrated to warmer climates for winter and only 14 birds are staying near the mountain. So, initially there were 20 + 14 = 34 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  If 23 families of birds fly to Africa and 37 families fly to Asia, then the number of families that remain near the mountain is equal to the total number of families minus the number of families that flew away.  Therefore, there are 85 families remaining near the mountain if 23 + 37 = 60 families flew away.
Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain. If 42 families of birds fly to Africa and 31 families fly to Asia, then we can calculate the number of families flying to Africa as follows: Number of families flying to Africa = Total number of families - Number of families flying to Asia = 8 - 31 = 53 families. Therefore, 53 families of birds fly to Africa more than those who fly to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain. If 47 families of birds fly to Africa and 94 families fly to Asia, then how many more families fly to Asia than those who flew to Africa?  Therefore, the answer is 94 - 47 = 47 more families of birds flying to Asia than those who flew to Africa.
Response:  We know that 38 families of birds fly to Africa and 80 families fly to Asia. So, in total, we have: 38 + 80 = 118 families of birds flying away for winter. Therefore, the answer is 118.
Response:  We know that in recent years (mùa hè), most animals have migrated to warmer countries. If there were originally 87 families of birds living near a mountain, and if 18 more families joined them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now...  Well, let's see!
Response:  We know that there are 49 families of birds living near the mountain and 59 families have already migrated to warmer places for winter. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is 49 + 59 = 108. Therefore, there are 108 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds migrate to warmer places during winter and come from near a mountain. If there were initially 41 bird families living near the mountain, then we can conclude that there are now fewer than 41 families remaining in the area. Therefore, the number of bird families living near the mountain is less than or equal to 41 - 27 = 14.
Response:  If there are initially 45 families of birds living near the mountain and 86 families migrate to warmer places for winter, then the number of families that remain in the area is:  Number of remaining families = Initial number of families - Number of families that migrated = 45 - 86 = -41 families. So, there are 41 fewer families of birds living near the mountain after migration.
Response:  We know that there are 41 families of birds living near the mountain. If 35 families of birds fly to Asia and 62 families fly to Africa, then how many more families fly to Africa than to Asia?  Therefore, the answer is 62 - 35 = 27 more families of birds fly to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 26 new families of birds coming from the North Pole to live near the mountain and 2 families of birds flying further south for winter. So, in total, there are 28 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  At first, Paul received 253 pens as his birthday gift. Then he lost or gave away 70 of them, leaving him with 183 pens at the end of the year. So, the answer is 183.
Response:  At first, Paul had 551 pens and gave away or lost 374 of them (since he only has 177 left). So, he received 374 new pens for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 pens as a gift and he gave away 111 pens to his friends during the year. So, the number of pens left with him is:  440 - 111 = 329 pens. Therefore, Paul has 329 pens left.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 65 pens for his birthday and gave away 213 pens to his friends during the year. So, he has given away more than he got. Therefore, the number of pens that were given away is:

$$ = 213 - 65 = 148 $$

So, $148$ pens were given away or lost during the year."
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 pens as gifts for his birthday and he gave away 571 pens to his friends during the year. So, the number of pens he has left is:  589 - 571 = 18 pens. Therefore, Paul has given away more pens than he received.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 pens as gifts for his birthday and gave away 90 pens to his friends during the year. So he has 210 pens left (110 - 90 = 210). Now we need to find out how many more pens Paul lost than he gave away. To do this, we subtract the number of pens he gave away from the total number of pens he had: 210 - 90 = 120. Therefore, Paul lost 120 pens more than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 pens in total during his school year and lost 558 pens. So he has 332 pens left. Now we are asked how many pens he received for his birthday if he only had 332 pens left. Therefore, the answer is 332 pens.
Response:  If Paul has 100 pens and gives away 52 of them, he will have 48 pens left (100 - 52 = 48).  Then in one year, he gave away 535 more pens, so he will have 48 + 535 = 683 pens left. Therefore, 535 pens were given away or lost during that year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 pens and 66 erasers as his birthday gift. At the end of the year, he had only 154 pens left. So, we can calculate the number of pens that were either lost or given away as follows: Number of pens lost = Total number of pens - Number of pens left at the end of the year = 521 - 154 = 367 pens Therefore, 367 pens were either lost or given away during the year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 531 pens and 38 erasers as his gift. At the end of the year, he had only 391 pens left while none of them were erasers. So, the number of pens Paul has is 391 - 531 = -140 pens. Therefore, the correct answer is -140.
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 pens and 406 erasers as his gift. At the end of the year, he had only 336 pens left. So, we can deduce that he must have used 265 pens (601 - 336 = 265). Now, let's find out how many erasers he has left. Since he had 406 erasers initially, and he used 265 of them, he must have 141 erasers left (406 - 265 = 141). Therefore, there are 141 erasers remaining with him.
"Response:  At first, Paul had 40 pens (the number given in the problem). Then he lost or gave away 315 pens, leaving him with 291 pens at the end of the year. So, the number of pens that Paul received as gifts for his birthday is equal to the original number of pens he had minus the number he lost or gave away, which is:  
$$ = 40 - 315 = -275 $$
So, Paul received $275 worth of colorful pens for his birthday."
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 pens as gifts for his birthday and he gave away 308 pens to his friends during the year. So, the difference between the number of pens he received and the number of pens he gave away is:  267 - 308 = -41. Therefore, Paul gave away more pens than he received.
Response:  We know that Paul received 457 pieces of tape and 320 pens as his gift. At the end of the year, he had 523 pens left, which means he used 197 pens (320 - 523). Now, let's calculate how many pens he used each day: Number of pens used per day = Total number of pens used / Number of days in the year = 197 / 365 = 0.54 pens per day So, Paul used approximately 0.54 pens per day.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving 7 customers behind. So, the number of customers who remained is 7 - 3 = 4 more than the original number of customers who stayed. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  At first, there were 3 customers (the bartender and 2 customers). Then, one customer left, leaving 2 customers. After that, another customer left, leaving 1 customer. So, in total, there are 2 customers who have left more than those who remained. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  At first, the person had 10 customers (10 - 9 = 1). After 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers (12 = 3 + 9), so at that point in time, he had 3 new customers.
"Response:  If one person has 14 customers and there are 5 more customers to be served, then the total number of customers that this person will have is:

14 + 5 = 19

So, the answer is 19."
Response:  At first, there were 13 customers (including the bartender). Then, some of them left, reducing the number to 4 new customers. So, in total, there are now 13 + 4 = 17 customers at the bar.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers (including the bartender). Then, 15 customers left, leaving 12 + 15 = 27 customers. Finally, 14 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers is now 27 - 14 = 13 customers. Therefore, the bartender has 13 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, there were 3 customers (A, B, and C). Then, after adding some more people, there were 8 customers in total (including A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). So, the number of new customers who came is equal to the difference between 8 and 3, which is 5. Therefore, 5 new customers arrived.
"Response:  At first, there are 8 guests. Then, some of them leave, reducing the number to 5. Finally, 99 new guests arrive, so the total number of guests is:

8 - 5 + 99 = 102

Therefore, there are 102 guests in total (including both old and new ones)."
Response:  At first, the host had 12 guests and then some left, leaving him with 14 guests. Later, he gained 10 new guests, so the total number of guests now is:  12 (initial) + (-3) = 9  Then add the new guests:  9 + 10 = 19 So, the host currently has 19 guests.
Response:  After buying a bag of chocolate for $2, Dan has $2 - $1 = $1 left.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and after buying a bag of chocolate, he is left with $3. So, the cost of one bag of chocolate is equal to $4 - $3 = $1. Therefore, the price of one bag of chocolate is $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he bought 99 pieces of candy with each piece costing $3. So, we can calculate the total amount spent as follows: Total amount = Number of pieces x Price per piece = 99 x $3 = $297 Now, we need to find out how much money Dan has left after buying the candy. Money left = Original money - Amount spent = $4 - $297 =-$293 Therefore, Dan has $293 left after buying the candy.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he buys 2 pieces of candy with equal prices. So, the price of each piece of candy is:
$3 / 2 = $1.50 per piece of candy. Therefore, the price of each piece of candy is $1.50."
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 and he bought some candy with price of $6 per piece. So, we can calculate how many pieces of candy he could buy as follows: Number of pieces = Total amount of money / Price of each piece = $2 / $6 = 0.33 pieces (or 3 pieces) Therefore, Dan bought 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $2 for the chocolate bar, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spent $3 for the candy, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, Dan has $2 left after buying both items.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $7 for the chocolate bar and $6 for the candy. Therefore, he has spent a total of $7 + $6 = $13. So, Dan has spent $13 to buy the chocolate bar and the candy.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $6 for the chocolate bar, so he has $2 - $6 = $4 left. Then, he spent $3 for the candy, so he has $4 - $3 = $1 left. Therefore, Dan spent a total of $4 + $1 = $5 to buy both items.
Response:  For the chocolate bar, Dan paid $3. So he spent $3 / 1 = $3 for the chocolate bar.  Now, let's calculate how much he spent for the candy bar. He paid $2 + $3 = $5 for both items together. Therefore, he spent $5 / 2 = $2.50 for the candy bar.
"Response: 
Dan has $4.00 and buys a piece of candy for $8.00. So he now has $4.00 - $8.00 = $4.00 - $8.00 = $4.00 - $12.00 = $8.00 left. Therefore, his friend gives him $8.00 more."
Response:  At first, Dan had $4. After buying a bar of chocolate for $3, he was left with $1. So, the price of one bar of chocolate is $3.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spends $3 on something. So, he has $4 - $3 = $1 left. Now, he buys 10 pieces of candy each piece costs $1, so he pays a total of $1 x 10 = $10 for the candy. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after buying the candy.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he buys 2 pieces of candy with equal prices. So, we can write the equation as follows:

$3 = (x1 + x2) where x1 is the price of one piece of candy and x2 is the price of another piece of candy.

Since Dan bought two pieces of candy, their total cost is twice the cost of each piece:

Total Cost = 2(Price of one piece of candy)

Now, we are given that the price of each piece of candy is equal to each other, so we can substitute this information into our previous equation:

$3 = (x1 + x2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x1 + x2 = 3

Solving for x1, we get:

x1 = $1.50

So, the price of one piece of candy is $1.50. Since Dan bought two pieces of candy, the total cost of the candy is:

Total Cost = 2($1.50) = $3.00

Therefore, the answer is $3.00."
"Response: 
Dan spends $3 for the chocolate bar, so he has spent $3 + $2 = $5 left after buying the chocolate bar.
He then spends $7 on the candy, so he has spent $5 - $7 = $-2 left after buying the candy.
Therefore, Dan has spent $-2 to buy the candy compared to the $3 he spent to buy the chocolate bar."
"Response: 
Dan spent $7 for the chocolate bar and $2 for the candy. Therefore, he spent a total of $9 (=$7 + $2). So, he spent more money to buy the chocolate bar than the candy."
"Response:  We know that Paul has 115 books in total and he sold 78 of them during the sale. So, we have to find out how many books Paul still has left. To do this, we can divide the number of books he had initially (115) by the number of books he sold (78):

115 - 78 = 37

So, Paul still has 37 books left after the sale."
"Response:  We know that after Paul sold 137 books, he had 105 left. So initially, Paul must have had x cups of books where x is the number he has at the end minus the number he sold (105). Solving for x, we get:
x = 105 - 137 = -32
Therefore, Paul initially had -32 cups of books."
Response:  If Paul had 108 books initially and sold some of them during the sale, then he has fewer books left after the sale. We know that he gave away 35 books to his friend and sold some more during the sale. So, the number of books he has left is equal to the initial number minus the number given away plus the number sold. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of books remaining = Initial number - (Number given away + Number sold) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of books remaining = 108 - (35 + x) Where x is the number of books sold during the sale. Since Paul sold some books during the sale, we have x > 0. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the above equation. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Using substitution method, we get: 108 - (35 + x) = 62 Solving for x, we get: x = 46 So, Paul sold 46 books during the sale.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying from a market, he has 151 books now. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books Paul had = 50
Number of books Paul bought = x
Total number of books Paul has = Number of books Paul had + Number of books Paul bought
= 50 + x

Now, we are given that the total number of books Paul has is 151. So, we can solve for 'x' using substitution method:

151 = 50 + x
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives us:

x = 101
Therefore, Paul bought 101 books at the market."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 2 books and then he sold some of them to buy a new car. After buying the new car, he now has 58 books left. So, if he sold some of his initial 2 books, we can assume that he sold half of them (since he bought a new car). Therefore, he sold 2/2 = 1 book initially. Now, let's calculate how many books he sold after buying the new car:  Number of books sold = Total number of books - Initially sold books = 58 - 1 = 57 books.  So, Paul sold 57 books in total.
Response:  If Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them to buy 42 new ones, then he has 21 - X books left with him where X is the number of books he sold. Now if he has 15 books left with him, it means that he sold (21 - 15) = 6 books originally. So, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and then he sold some of them in a garage sale to raise money for charity. After the garage sale, he bought 38 new books, so now he has 71 + 38 = 109 books. Therefore, if he buys additional 116 books, he will have 109 + 116 = 225 books in total.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After he sold some of them in a car boot sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, the number of books he sold at the car boot sale is equal to 108 - 66 = 42 books. Similarly, the number of pens he sold is equal to 55 - 59 = -6 pens (since you can't sell something you don't have). Therefore, the answer to your question is 42 books and -6 pens.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 51 books and 106 pens. After he sold some of them in a car boot sale, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens. So, he sold how many pens during the car boot sale? To find out, we can use the following equation: Number of pens sold = Initial number of pens - Remaining number of pens After the sale Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pens sold = 106 - 14 = 92 pens Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens during the car boot sale.
Response:  If Paul had initially 136 books and sold 27 of them, then he has left with (136 - 27) = 109 books remaining.
Response:  If Paul has 134 books and gives away 39 to his friend, he will have 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, if he sells some of them in a car boot sale, he will be left with 68 books (95 -? = 68). So, the answer is 37 (68 - 95 = 37).
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 pens and 153 books. After he sold some of them in a book fair, he had 13 books left and 23 pens left. So, if he sold x books during the fair, then he had 13 - x books left initially. Similarly, if he sold y pens during the fair, then he had 23 - y pens left initially. Therefore, we can write the equation: 13 - x = 23 - y. Solving for x, we get: x = 40. So, Paul sold 40 books during the fair. Now, let's find out how many pens he sold. Since he had 23 pens left initially, and he sold y pens during the fair, we can write the equation: 23 + y = 95. Solving for y, we get: y = 72. So, Paul sold 72 pens during the fair.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 pens and 143 books. After he sold some of them in a book fair, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. So, if he sold x number of pens during the book fair, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pens = Initial number of pens - Number of pens sold During the book fair (x) Now, we are asked to find out how many pens Paul sold during the book fair. To do this, we need to solve for x in the above equation. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pens = 42 - x Number of books = 143 Therefore, the value of x is 79. So, Paul sold 79 pens during the book fair.
Response:  We know that Jessica has already cut 8 flowers from her garden and placed them in the vase. So, there are now 8 + 10 = 18 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  At first, there were 16 bougainvilleas in the vase (Jessica cut 16 from her own garden). Then, she added 16 more bougainvilleas to the vase (from the store). So, initially, there were 16 + 16 = 32 bougainvilleas in the vase. Therefore, the correct answer is 32.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 baskets of roses in the bowl (Jessica took 4 roses out and added some new ones from her garden). So, initially, there were 2 x 2 = 4 roses in the bowl. Then, Jessica cut additional roses to add to the bowl, so the total number of roses after she finished is 4 + however many roses she cut. Therefore, the answer is 4 + X, where X is the number of roses Jessica cut.
Response:  Firstly, Jessica picked 33 bougainvilleas from the bowl and added them to her new bouquet. So, initially there were 15 bougainvilleas in the bowl and then 33 + 15 = 48 bougainvilleas in total. Now, she cut some more bougainvilleas from her garden and added them to the bowl, making it have 17 bougainvilleas in total. Therefore, the correct answer is (17 - 15) = 2 more bougainvilleas than what Jessica originally had in the bowl.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 21 roses in her bowl initially. Then she took out 34 roses from the bowl and added some new ones from her garden to make it up to 15 roses left in the bowl. So, the number of roses Jessica took out is 34 - 21 = 13. Therefore, more roses were taken out than those cut from the garden.
Response:  We know that Jessica has 7 original roses in her garden and she cut some more from there, making it total 59 roses. Now we are told that there are 20 roses left in the jar. So, if we subtract the number of roses left in the jar (20) from the total number of roses Jessica had (59), we get the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden:  59 - 20 = 39   Therefore, Jessica cut 39 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that Jessica has cut some roses from her garden and added them to the jar, so there are now 12 roses in the jar instead of 13. This means that there were originally 13 - 12 = 1 rose left in the garden. Therefore, there are still 1 rose left in the garden.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 15 baskets of roses and 62 baskets of daisies in Jessica's garden. Then she cut some more roses and daisies from her garden. Now there are 17 baskets of roses and 96 baskets of daisies in the bowl. So, if we subtract the initial number of roses (15) from the total number of flowers in the bowl (96), we get the number of roses that Jessica cut:  
$ Number of roses = Total number of flowers - Initial number of roses $ $ = 96 - 15 $ $ = 81 $ Therefore, Jessica cut 81 baskets of roses from her garden."
Response:  We know that Jessica has cut some roses and orchids from her garden. Initially, there were 12 rose bushes and 2 orchid plants in the pot. After cutting, there are now 10 rose bushes and 21 orchid plants in the pot. So, Jessica must have cut 2 orchid plants. Therefore, the correct answer is (2).
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 roses and 3 lilies in the bowl. Then, Jessica cut more roses and lilies from her garden. So now we have 12 roses and 2 lilies in the bowl. To find out how many more roses than lilies are in the bowl now, we need to subtract the number of lilies from the number of roses. Therefore, the answer is:  There are 9 more roses than lilies in the bowl now (12 - 2 = 9).
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses and 12 sunflowers in the bowl. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and sunflowers from her garden. So now there are 11 roses and 20 sunflowers in the bowl. To find out how many more sunflowers than roses are in the bowl now, we can simply subtract the number of roses from the number of sunflowers:  Number of sunflowers - Number of roses = 20 - 11 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more sunflowers than roses in the bowl now.
Response:  At first, there were 3 bougainvilleas in the vase (Jessica cut some from the garden). Now, there are 19 bougainvilleas in the vase. So, if there were initially 3 bougainvilleas, Jessica must have cut 16 additional bougainvilleas (19 - 3 = 16).
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 baskets of roses and 84 baskets of chrysanthemums in Jessica's garden. Then, she cut some more flowers from her garden to add to the existing ones in the basket. So, after adding new flowers, there are now 91 baskets of chrysanthemums and 14 baskets of roses in the basket. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses (13) from the final number of roses (14). Therefore, Jessica cut 11 baskets of roses.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 bông hoa lanh in the bowl and after Jessica cut some flowers from her garden, there are now 7 bông lan in the bowl. So, Jessica must have cut 3 - 7 = 4 bông lan.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 sunflowers in the vase. Then Jessica added more flowers from her garden, including rose and sunflower. So now we have 21 sunflowers and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses than sunflowers are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of sunflowers from the number of roses:  Number of roses - Number of sunflowers = 22 - 21 = 1 Therefore, there is one more rose than sunflower in the vase now.
Response:  Initially, there were 9 roses and 6 lilies in the bowl.  Jessica added more roses from her garden, so now there are 13 lilies and 3 roses in the bowl. Therefore, there are 10 more lilies than roses in the bowl right now.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off 2 inches, then her new length would be 15 inches (17 - 2 = 15). Now, if she cut another 2 inches off, her new length would be 13 inches (15 - 2 = 13). So, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair (2 + 2 = 4).
Response:  If Robin cut her hair from 20 inches to 10 inches, then before she cut it, her hair was 30 inches long (20 - 10 = 30).
Response:  Firstly, Robin cut off 11 inches of her hair, so she had 5 inches left (16 - 11 = 5). Then, an additional 12 inches were added to her hair, making it a total of 17 inches long (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Robin's hair is now 17 inches long.
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and she grows an additional 18 inches, her new total length of hair would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.
Response:  At first, her hair was 14 inches long. Then, she cut it to 13 inches. So now, her hair is 13 - 14 = -1 inch shorter than before.
Response:  Firstly, Robin had 14 inches of hair, which increased by 8 inches to make it 22 inches. Then she cut off 20 inches, leaving her with 2 inches of hair. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 bottle caps in his collection and he found 53 bottle caps at the park. So, we can say that Danny now has 65 bottle caps (12 + 53).
Response:  We know that Danny already has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he found some more at the park. So, let's call the total number of bottle caps he found at the park as x. Since Danny now has 53 bottle caps in total, we can write the equation: 21 + x = 53. Solving for x, we get: x = 32. Therefore, Danny found 32 bottle caps at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 51 empty cans and he threw away 12 of them, so he has 51 - 12 = 49 empty cans left. Then, he found 63 new empty cans in the park, so he now has 49 + 63 = 112 empty cans in his collection. Therefore, Danny initially had 51 empty cans.
Response:  We know that Danny found 36 can lids at the park and he already threw away 35 of them. So, the number of can lids left is 22 (36 - 35).
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 can lids at the park and he already had 63 can lids in his collection before going to the park. So, the total number of can lids Danny has now is: 30 + 63 = 93 can lids. Therefore, Danny threw away more can lids than he found at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny found 22 can tops and 8 bottle caps at the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 items in his collection initially. Then, he found additional 28 can tops and 63 bottle caps later, bringing the total number of items in his collection to 30 + 28 = 58. Therefore, Danny initially had 30 can tops.
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 cans and 30 labels before he went to the park. After he collected some more at the park, he now has 17 cans and 57 labels in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 39 (22 + 17) cans and 87 (30 + 57) labels. Therefore, the number of labels Danny had first is 87.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 bottle caps and 14 labels at the park. So initially he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection. Then he found 7 more bottle caps and 86 more labels. Therefore, after finding these additional items, he now has 44 + 7 = 51 bottle caps and 86 + 86 = 172 labels in his collection. Since we are asked how many bottle caps Danny found more than labels, we can subtract the number of labels from the total number of bottle caps to get our answer: 51 - 172 = -121.So, Danny found fewer bottle caps than labels at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny found 11 bottle caps and 28 bagels at the park. Then he collected 68 bottle caps and 51 bagels from his collection. So, the total number of bagels he found at the park is 28 + 68 = 96. Therefore, Danny found more bagels than bottle caps at the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 71 caps and 24 labels at the park. Then he found 28 more caps and 16 more labels in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 71 + 28 = 99 caps and 24 + 16 = 40 labels. Therefore, Danny has more caps than labels. The difference between the number of caps and labels is 99 - 40 = 59.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 can lids and 62 bottle caps. Then he found more can lids (27) and bottle caps (43). So, the total number of can lids Danny has now is:  10 + 27 = 37 can lids. Similarly, the total number of bottle caps Danny has now is:  62 + 43 = 105 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny has 105 bottle caps more than can lids now.
"Response:  At first, Danny had 66 cans of beer at the park. Then he lost some of them and now he has 25 left in his collection. So, to find out how many cans of beer Danny had initially, we need to subtract the number of cans he currently has from the total number of cans he had at first:  
$$ \therefore NumberOfCansAtFirst = TotalNumberOfCans - CurrentNumberOfCans $$  
Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:  
$$ \therefore NumberOfCansAtFirst = 66 - 25 = 41 $$  Therefore, Danny had 41 cans of beer at the beginning."
Response:  If Danny had 25 cans of beer in his collection before he went to the park and found 17 more, then he had a total of 25 + 17 = 42 cans of beer in his collection after finding them at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 60 old bottle caps and he found 58 new ones in the park. So, initially, Danny had 60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps. Later, he added 6 more new bottle caps to his collection, making it 118 + 6 = 124 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny had 124 bottle caps at the end of the story.
Response:  We know that Danny found 50 new cans at the park and he already had 6 old ones in his collection before going to the park. So, the total number of cans Danny has now is:  50 + 6 = 56. Therefore, Danny found 6 more cans than he already had at the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 48 new cans and threw away 54 old ones at the park. So, he has 52 cans in his collection now. To find out how many more cans he threw away than he found, we need to subtract the number of cans he found from the total number of cans he threw away:  52 - 48 = 4 Therefore, Danny threw away 4 more cans than he found at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 82 bottle caps and 29 lid. Then he found 42 more bottle caps at the park. So, initially, Danny had 82 + 42 = 124 bottle caps. Now, he has 61 additional bottles in his collection. Therefore, the total number of bottle caps that Danny had initially is 124 + 61 = 185 bottle caps.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 caps and 39 bottles at first. Then he found 16 more caps and 68 more bottles. So, in total, Danny has 66 + 16 = 82 caps and 39 + 68 = 107 bottles now. Therefore, the number of bottles Danny had first is 68.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 21 bottle caps and 52 labels in his collection. Then he found more than 46 label at the park but not enough to cover all of the bottles he already had (since there were only 50 bottles). So, after finding those extra labels, Danny now has 21 + x bottle caps where x is the number of labels he found minus the number of labels he already had (52 - 46 = 6). Therefore, Danny found more bottle caps than labels at the park.
Response:  At first, Danny found 65 beer can holders and 5 beer caps at the park. Then he collected 31 beer caps and 9 beer bottles from his collection. So initially, he had more beer bottles than beer caps at the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of beer bottles found at the park and the number of beer caps found at the park is 65 - 31 = 34.
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 caps and 25 labels before he went to the park. After he collected some more at the park, he now has 11 labels and 12 caps in his collection. So, initially, Danny had more caps than labels (58 - 25 = 33). Now, after collecting more at the park, he has more labels than caps (11 - 12 = -1). Therefore, Danny has fewer labels than caps.
Response:  We know that Danny had 15 caps and 18 labels before he went to the park.  After he collected some more at the park, he now has 67 labels and 35 caps in his collection. So, how many more labels than caps does he have now?  To find out, we can subtract the number of caps from the number of labels: 67 - 35 = 32. Therefore, Danny has 32 more labels than caps in his collection right now.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 11 oranges than Steven. So if Jake has 17 oranges, then Steven must have more than 11 but less than 28 oranges. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) More than 11 but less than 28.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 14 quahogs than Jill and Jake together. So, if Jake has x quahogs, then Steven must have x + 14 quahogs. Now we are given that Jake has fewer than 7 quahogs than Steven. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x < 7 - (x + 14). Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Jake has 9 quahogs.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 18 apples and Steven has more than 13 apples. So, if we assume that Jake has x apples, then Steven must have y apples where y > x. Now, we are given that Steven has 19 apples in total, which means that y + x = 19 (since Jake has x apples). Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
So, Jill has 16 apples."
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 8 quails, and he also has 5 quails. So, if we subtract 5 from 8, we get 3. Therefore, Jake has 3 quails more than Jill.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 12 apples and Steven has more than 11 apples. So, we can say that Jake has x apples where x is less than or equal to 11. Now, we are given that Steven has 4 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 4 = 11... (1)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
x = 7... (2)
So, Jake has 7 apples. As for Jill, we are not given any information about her apple count in the question."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 apples and more than 9 apples compared to Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x apples, then we can write an inequality based on the information given in the problem:
x < 7... (1)
x > 9... (2)
Now, we are also told that Steven has 16 apples. Therefore, we can set up another inequality:
x + 16 = 100... (3)
From equation (1), we get x < 7, which means that x is less than or equal to 7. Substituting this value into equation (3), we get:
x + 16 ≤ 100
Subtracting 16 from both sides gives us:
x ≤ 84
Therefore, Jake has at most 84 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 apples than Steven and more than 8 apples than Jill. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 7 apples. Since Steven has 17 apples in total, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) = 17

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 7 = 17

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

2x = 10

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 5

So, Jill has 5 apples."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 9 apples and more than 18 apples compared to Jill. So, there must be some number between 9 and 18 that represents how many apples Jake has. Let's call this number x. Since Steven has 16 apples, we can say that Steven has x + 2 apples (since he has 2 more apples than Jake). Now, we need to find out how many apples Steven has relative to Jill. If Steven has x + 2 apples and Jill has 18 - 3 = 15 apples, then Steven has 3x + 5 apples more than Jill. Therefore, the difference in the number of apples between Steven and Jill is 3x + 5.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 6 apples and Jill has 5 apples. So, if Jake has x apples, he must have fewer than 6 + 5 = 11 apples. Therefore, Jake has 9 apples (x).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 5 apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples, then Jake has less than x - 5 apples.  We also know that Jill has more than 18 apples than Jake. So if Jake has y apples, then Jill has y + 18 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation based on these two statements:
x - 5 = y (Jake has fewer than 5 apples than Steven)
y + 18 = z (Jill has more than 18 apples than Jake)
Now we need to solve for y in terms of x and z. Using substitution or elimination method, we get:
y = x - 3
So Jake has 3 apples less than Steven. If Steven has x apples, then Jake has x - 3 apples.
Therefore, the answer is: Jake has 3 apples less than Steven."
"Response:  According to the question, we know that:
Jake has fewer than 16 apples (he is compared to Steven).
Steven has more than 15 apples (compared to Jill).
Jill has 12 apples.
So, let's compare how many apples each person has:
Jake - fewer than 16 = x
Steven - more than 15 = y
Jill - 12 = z
Now, we can set up an equation based on these comparisons:
x + y = 38 (total number of apples)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 - y
Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:
(16 - y) + y = 38
Combine like terms:
16 + y = 38
Subtract 16 from both sides:
y = 22
Therefore, Jill has 22 more apples than Jake."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 12 apples and more than 79 apples compared to Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from the total number of apples Jake has, we will get his remaining apple count. Therefore, Jake has 67 apples ( = 79 - 12).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 13 apples and more than 3 oranges. So, he must have at least 3 + 1 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Jake has 4 oranges.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 6 apples and more than 8 apples compared to Steven. So, let's assume that Jake has x apples. Since Steven has 17 apples and 16 oranges, we can write an equation as follows:

Jake's apples = x (less than 6) + 8 (more than)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

x = 6 - 8

Therefore, Steven has 2 more apples than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 3 apples and more than 10 oranges compared to Steven. So, let's assume that Jake has x apples and y oranges. Since Steven has 12 apples and 15 oranges, we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 3 (Jake has fewer than 3 apples)
y > 10 (Jake has more than 10 oranges)
Now, we need to find out how many oranges Steven has more than Jake. Let's substitute the values of x and y into the first equation:
x + y = 3... (1)
Substituting the values given in the question:
x + y = 3... (1)
x = 6 (since Jake has 6 apples)
y = 9 (since Jake has 9 oranges more than Steven)
Therefore, Steven has 9 more oranges than Jake."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 quả đào and Jill has more than 67 quả đào. So, we can say that Jill has x quả đào where x is greater than or equal to 67. Now, we are told that Jake has fewer quả đào than Steven. Therefore, Jake has y quả đào where y is less than 12. Finally, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:  x + y = 12... (1) Substituting y = 9 (the number of quả đào that Jake has), we get:  x + 9 = 12... (2) Solving for x, we get: x = 35. So, Jake has 9 quả đào.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 quả đào and Jake has fewer than 12 quả đào compared to Steven. So, Jake must have at least 6 quả đào (since he cannot have more than 12 - 6 = 6). Now we know that Jill has more quả đào than Jake, so she must have at least 7 quả đào (since she cannot have less than 7 - 6 = 1). Therefore, Jill has exactly 7 quả đào.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 apples and Jill has fewer than 12 apples compared to Steven. So, Jill must have at least 13, 14,..., 19 apples (since she cannot have more than 19). Therefore, Jake must have between 13 and 19 apples. Since Jake also has more than 72 apples than Jill, he must have exactly 81 apples.  So, the answer is 81.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 apples and Jake has fewer than 6 apples compared to Steven. So, if we subtract 6 from 14, we get 8. Therefore, Jake has 8 apples. Now, we are told that Jill has more than 3 apples than Jake. If Jill has x apples, then Jake has 8 - x apples. Since Jill has more than 3 apples than Jake, we can say that x > 3. Therefore, Jill has at least 11 apples (since 11 is greater than 3).
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 10 apples and fewer than 84 apples compared to Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then he must have less than 84 - 10 = 74 apples. Now we can find out how many apples Jake has by subtracting the number of apples he has from the total number of apples Steven has: 74 (Jake) < 13 + 52 = 65. Therefore, Jake has 65 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steve. So, Jake has at least 13 + 17 = 30 apples. Now we need to find out how many pears Jake has. According to the problem, Jake has fewer pears than Steve. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steve has x + 8 = 26 pears (since he has 8 more pears than Jake). Therefore, Jake has 30 - x = 20 pears. Since Jake cannot have a negative number of pears, we must have x = 10. Thus, Jake has 30 - 10 = 20 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 8 apples and more than 10 apples. So, there must be at least 8 - 10 = 2 apples in Jake's bag. Similarly, we know that Steven has 11 tangerines and 18 oranges. Since he has more tangerines than oranges, there must be at least 11 - 18 = -7 tangerines in his bag (a negative number indicates that he has fewer tangerines). Therefore, Steven has 7 more oranges than tangerines.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 3 apples and more than 4 oranges compared to Steven. So, let's assume that Jake has x apples and y oranges. Since Steven has 19 oranges and 15 apples, we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 4 (since Jake has more than 4 oranges)
x < 3 (since Jake has fewer than 3 apples)
Now, we need to solve for y. Using the first equation, we get:
x + y = 4... (1)
Substituting the value of x from the second equation, we get:
y = 16 - 3 = 13
So, Steven has 13 more oranges than apples. Therefore, Steven has 19 oranges and 15 apples."
Response:  We know that Olivia has $78 in her wallet and she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, now she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.
"Response:  We know that Olivia spent $78 at the store and has $33 left. So, if she had $100 initially (which is what we are trying to find out), then we can set up an equation as follows:

$100 - $78 = $33

Now, let's solve for $100:

$100 = $78 + $33

$100 = $111

So, Olivia had $111 initially."
Response:  Firstly, Olivia had $100 in her wallet. Then she withdrew an additional $148 from an ATM, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148). Finally, after shopping at the supermarket, she was left with $159. Therefore, Olivia spent a total of $71 ($248 - $159) during her shopping trip.
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her wallet and withdrew an additional $49 from an ATM. After she went to the store, she was left with $49. So, she spent more money at the store than she withdrew from the ATM. Therefore, the difference between what she spent at the store and what she withdrew from the ATM is $49 - $49 = $0."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her wallet and withdrew an additional $91 from an ATM. After she went to the store, she was left with $14. So, if she spent more money at the store than she withdrew from the ATM, then... $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her wallet and spent $49 at the store. So she has $57 left after shopping at the store. Now we are told that she went to a gallery where she spent $26. Therefore, Olivia now has $31 left ($57 - $26).
Response:  At first, there were $54 in Olive's purse. After she bought some things and paid with her credit card, she had $29 left. So, she spent $25 ($54 - $29).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia spent $38 at the store. So, her initial balance in her wallet was $128 - $38 = $90. Therefore, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after buying something at the store.
Response:  If Dave has 19 applications on his phone and he has deleted 5 of them, then the number of remaining apps is 19 - 5 = 14. So, there are 14 applications on Dave's phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 23 applications on his phone (20 - 3 = 23). After deleting 18 of them, he was left with 5 applications (23 - 18 = 5). Therefore, at first, Dave had 5 applications on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, his total number of applications is 10 + 11 = 21. Now, he has removed some applications, leaving him with 4 remaining apps. Therefore, the number of applications Dave has left after removing some is 4.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications on his phone initially and then he added 89 more. So, the total number of applications on his phone after adding the new ones is:

21 + 89 = 106

Now, we are asked how many applications Dave has left after removing some. The question states that he removed ""some"" applications, but it doesn't give us any information about the exact number of applications he removed. Therefore, we can assume that he removed all of them, which means he has no applications left on his phone.

So, the final answer is:

Dave has 0 applications left on his phone after adding 89 new ones and removing some."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially and then he added 71 more. So, the total number of applications on his phone after adding these new ones is:

15 + 71 = 86

Now, we are asked how many applications Dave xed more than he added. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of applications Dave deleted from the total number of applications he had after adding the new ones:

86 - 14 = 72

Therefore, Dave xed more than 72 applications than he added."
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files initially and after deleting some of them he was left with 3 apps and 7 files. So, to find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he has now (7) from the initial number of files (21). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of files deleted = 21 - 7 = 14 files.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, leaving him with 21 applications and 4 files remaining. So, in total, Dave has 21 + 4 = 25 applications left on his phone after deleting some of them. Therefore, the correct answer is 25.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. To find out how many files are left after deleting all the applications, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of files: Number of files = Total number of files - Number of applications So, in this case, the number of files left on Dave's phone is: Number of files = 18 - 6 = 12 Therefore, there are 12 files left on Dave's phone after he deleted all the applications.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications before adding more, and he added 3 more, then he has 20 applications now (17 + 3 = 20).
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 59 files and applications on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 47 applications (59 - 12 = 47).
"Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files initially and after deleting some of them he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. So, to find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the initial number of files. Therefore, the number of files Dave deleted is:

Number of files deleted = Initial number of files - Number of files after deletion
= 24 - 21
= 3
Therefore, Dave deleted 3 files."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of applications remaining on his phone is 12 - 9 = 3 more than the number of files remaining on his phone, which is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Dave has 8 more applications than files on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files remaining on his phone after deleting some of them is 24. Now, we need to find out how many applications were left on his phone after deleting some of them. According to the question, Dave was left with 2 applications after deleting some of them. Therefore, the number of applications left on his phone after deleting some of them is 2.
"Response:  We know that Nell has 242 cards and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we have:

Number of cards Nell has = 242
Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 136

Now, let's subtract the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff from the total number of cards she has:

Number of cards Nell still has = 242 - 136 = 106

Therefore, Nell still has 106 cards."
"Response:  If Nell had initially 301 cards and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has none left (since she said ""bây giờ cô ấy còn 154 thẻ""). So, her initial number of cards was 301."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she has 252 cards left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cards Nell had = 528  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = x  Now, we are given that Nell gave Jeff ""a few"" cards. This means that x is a small number, so we can assume that x is equal to 1 or 2. Therefore, we have:  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 1 or 2  Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:  Number of cards Nell had = 528 - 1 or 528 - 2 = 526 or 524  Since we are looking for a whole number, we will choose the smaller value, which is 524. So, Nell gave Jeff 1 card."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she has 535 cards left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cards Nell has = 535 (initial) - Number of cards given to Jeff. Now, we need to find out how many cards Jeff got from Nell. According to the question, Jeff received ""v"" number of cards from Nell. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows: Number of cards Jeff has = Number of cards given to him by Nell. Substituting the value of ""v"" from the first equation into the second equation, we get: Number of cards Jeff has = 535 ( initial ) - 566 ( total number of cards Nell had initially ) = 234 ( final answer ) So, the answer is 234 cards."
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 cards of hearts and 356 cards of 10s. She gave some to Jeff and now she has 415 hearts and 149 tens left. To find out how many more hearts than tens Nell has, we can subtract the number of tens from the total number of hearts:  Number of hearts = 415 - 149 = 266  Therefore, Nell has 266 more hearts than tens.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 cards of baseball and 214 cards of 10. She gave some to Jeff and now she has 404 cards of baseball and 495 cards of 10. So, we can calculate the number of cards of 10 that Nell has more than baseball as follows: Number of cards of 10 that Nell has more = Total number of cards of 10 - Number of cards of baseball that Nell has Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this formula: Number of cards of 10 that Nell has more = 495 - 404 = 91 Therefore, Nell has 91 more cards of 10 than baseball.
Response:  We know that Nell has 573 cards in total and she gave 195 cards to John. So, the number of cards left with her is: 573 - 195 = 378. Now, we are told that she gave more than 200 cards to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards given to Jeff is: 378 - 200 = 178. So, Nell gave Jeff 178 cards.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 438 cards of hearts and 18 cards of 10. She gave some to Jeff and now she has 55 cards of 10 and 178 cards of hearts left. To find out how many more cards of hearts Nell has than 10 cards, we can subtract the number of cards of 10 she has from the total number of cards of hearts she had:

Number of cards of hearts Nell has = 438 - 18 = 420

So, Nell has 420 more cards of hearts than 10 cards."
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 cards of hearts and 38 cards of 10. She gave some to Jeff and now she has 376 cards of 10 and 111 cards of hearts. So, we can calculate the number of cards of 10 that Nell has more than the number of cards of hearts as follows: Number of cards of 10 that Nell has more = Total number of cards of 10 - Number of cards of hearts that Nell has Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of cards of 10 that Nell has more = 376 - 111 = 265 Therefore, Nell has 265 more cards of 10 than she does of hearts.
Response:  Paco has already eaten 19 bananas and still has 35 left. So initially he had x bananas. Since he ate 19 bananas, we can write the equation: x - 19 = 35. Solving for x, we get: x = 54. Therefore, initially Paco had 54 bananas.
Response:  Paco has already eaten 28 bananas and he wants to eat only a little bit more. So, if he eats 7 more bananas, that means he will have eaten a total of 35 bananas (28 + 7). Therefore, Paco has eaten 35 bananas in total.
Response:  Paco eats 40 bananas. If he eats 2 bananas, then he has eaten 40 - 2 = 38 bananas. So, there are 38 bananas left for Paco.
Response:  Paco initially had 25 bánh quy and he ate 5 of them, so he has 20 left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more bánh quy, bringing his total to 23 (20 + 3 = 23). So, after eating 5 bánh quy, Paco has 18 bánh quy left (23 - 5 = 18).
Response:  Paco has already eaten 13 pieces of bread. Then he buys 36 more pieces of bread. So, in total, Paco has bought and eaten 36 + 13 = 49 pieces of bread.
Response:  Paco has eaten 5 bánh quy so far and given you 13 bánh quy. So, he still has 40 - 5 = 35 bánh quy left.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 pancakes and given 13 to his friend. So he has left with 4 pancakes (17 - 13 = 4). Now, if he eats 14 pancakes, then he will have eaten a total of 57 pancakes (4 + 14 = 57). Therefore, Paco has eaten more pancakes than he gave away (57 - 13 = 44).
Response:  Paco has eaten 12 bread rolls and given you 21 more than he ate. So, if he ate x bread rolls, then he gave you 21 + x bread rolls. We know that the total number of bread rolls Paco ate is equal to the number he gave you plus the number he ate himself (since he didn't give you any more than what he ate). Therefore, we can write the equation: 12 = x + y, where y is the number of bread rolls Paco ate. Solving for y, we get: y = 12 - x. Now we are given that Paco gave you 21 more than he ate, so the number of bread rolls Paco gave you is: 21 = y + x. Substituting the value of y from the previous equation into this one gives us: 21 = (12 - x) + x. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 9. So, Paco ate 3 bread rolls and gave you 15 more ( since 21 - 3 = 15).
Response:  Paco had initially 22 pieces of sweets and 75 pieces of salty snacks. If he ate 15 pieces of sweets, then he has 22 - 15 = 6 remaining sweet snacks. Similarly, if he ate 54 pieces of salty snacks, then he has 75 - 54 = 21 remaining salty snacks. Therefore, Paco still has 6 + 21 = 27 snacks left.
Response:  Paco has 9 pieces of sweet bread and eats 36 pieces. So he has 36 - 9 = 27 pieces left. Then, he also eats 3 pieces of savory bread, leaving him with 27 + 3 = 30 pieces of savory bread left. Therefore, there are 30 pieces of savory bread left for Paco.
Response:  Paco has 37 pieces of sweets and 11 pieces of savory food. He eats 5 pieces of sweet food and 2 pieces of savory food. So, he has left 37 - 5 = 32 pieces of sweets and 11 - 2 = 9 pieces of savory food. Now we know that Paco has more sweets than savory food. The difference between the number of sweets and savory food is 32 - 9 = 23. Therefore, Paco has 23 more pieces of sweets than savory food.
Response:  Paco has 8 pieces of sweet bread and eats 20 pieces. Therefore, he has 20 - 8 = 12 pieces left. Similarly, he has 6 pieces of savory bread and eats 34 pieces, leaving him with 6 - 34 = -28 pieces. So, Paco eats more sweet bread than savory bread.
Response:  At first, Paco had 37 bánh quy. Then he ate 36 of them, leaving him with 1 bánh quy remaining. So, Paco has 1 bánh quy left.
Response:  Paco had 36 bánh quy to start with and gave away 14 of them. That means he has 22 bánh quy left (36 - 14 = 22). Then, he ate 10 more bánh quy, leaving him with 12 bánh quy (22 - 10 = 12). So, Paco now has 12 bánh quy left.
Response:  Paco eats 41 bananas and gives you 9 bananas. After that, he eats 18 more bananas than what he gave you. So, if he gave you 9 bananas, then he ate 27 (18 + 9) more bananas than what he gave you. Therefore, the difference between the number of bananas Paco ate and the number of bananas he gave you is 27.
Response:  Paco eats 6 banh quys and then gives you 30 more. So, he has eaten 6 + 30 = 36 banh quys in total. Since he gave you 23 of them, he has 36 - 23 = 13 banh quys left. Therefore, he has more banh quys than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 97 pieces of sweets and 34 pieces of savory food. After eating some of them, he has 15 pieces of sweets left and 56 pieces of savory food left. So, to find out how many pieces of sweets Paco has left, we can subtract the number of sweets he ate from the initial amount:  Number of sweets Paco has left = Initial number of sweets - Number of sweets eaten = 97 - 15 = 82 pieces of sweets. Therefore, Paco has 82 pieces of sweets left.
Response:  Paco has 26 pieces of sweets and eats 14 of them. So he has 26 - 14 = 12 pieces of sweets left. Then, he eats 9 pieces of salty snacks. So, he has 12 + 9 = 21 pieces of snacks left. Therefore, there are 21 pieces of salted snacks remaining for Paco.
Response:  Paco has 39 pieces of candy and 6 pieces of salted snacks. He eats 23 pieces of candy and 32 pieces of candy. So he eats more candies than salted snacks by how many pieces?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of salted snacks he ate from the total number of candies he ate: 23 - 32 = -9. Therefore, Paco eats more candies than salted snacks by 9 pieces.
"Response:  Paco has 40 pieces of sweet bread and 25 pieces of savory bread. He eats 28 pieces of sweet bread and 15 pieces of savory bread. To find out how many more sweet bread he ate than savory bread, we can subtract the number of savory bread he ate from the total number of sweet bread he had:

Number of sweet bread Paco ate = Total number of sweet bread - Number of savory bread he ate
= 40 - 15
= 25
So, Paco ate 25 more pieces of sweet bread than savory bread."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $7 for her birthday. Then, she spent some money and now has $5 left. So, the amount of money Gwen spent is equal to the difference between the amount she received ($7) and the amount she has left ($5). Therefore, the answer is $2.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $10 for her birthday and she spent $8 of it. So, the amount left with Gwen is $2 ($10 - $8).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mother on her birthday. Then, her father gave her an additional $4. So far, Gwen has $6. Next, she spent $3, leaving her with $3 + $6 = $9. Therefore, Gwen has $9 left after spending $3.
"Response: 
Emily received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father for a total of $13. If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Emily's mother gave her more money than her father did."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father for a total of $9. Then she spent $4, so she had $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). Therefore, Gwen received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her dad and $7 from her mom on her birthday. So, in total, she received $12 ($5 + $7).  Now, if Gwen spends $4 of it, then she will have $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her dad. The difference between the amount given by her mom and dad is $8 - $5 = $3.
"Response: 
Em received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom on her birthday. If she spent $6 in total, then...

$5 + $2 = $7 (total amount given to Em)

So, Em received $7 from her dad and $2 from her mom."
Response:  We know that Josh had 9 marbles initially and lost some of them later. If he now has 4 marbles left, then he must have lost at least 5 marbles (since he started with 9). So, the number of marbles Josh lost is 5.
Response:  We know that Josh had x number of rocks in his collection initially and lost 21 rocks. So, he has fewer rocks now. Let's call the number of rocks he has now as y. Then we can write the equation: x - 21 = y. Now, we are asked to find out how many rocks Josh had initially if he has 12 rocks now. So, we can substitute y = 12 into the above equation: x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. Therefore, Josh had 33 rocks in his collection initially.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 balls in his collection. Then he lost 11 balls, so he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8). Finally, he found 5 new balls, so now he has a total of 13 balls (8 + 5 = 13). Therefore, Josh currently has 13 balls in his collection.
Response:  If Josh has 4 balls in his collection and he lost 16 balls, then he had 4 + 16 = 20 balls initially. Now, if he found 8 new balls, then he has 20 + 8 = 28 balls now. So, he lost more balls than he found. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls he lost and the number of balls he found is 16 - 8 = 8 balls.
Response:  Josh had 7 stones in his collection initially. He lost 8 stones and found 10 new ones. So, he gained 3 stones (10 - 8 = 3). Therefore, Josh has 4 stones more than what he initially had (7 + 3 = 10).
Response:  We know that Josh has 21 marbles in his collection and he finds 7 of them. So, we can say that Josh now has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 20 marbles in his collection. Then he gave 2 marbles to Jack. So, how many marbles does Josh have now?  We can write this as an equation:  Josh has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. Therefore, Josh has 18 marbles in his collection right now.
Response:  Josh had initially 22 pebbles in his collection. Then, Jack took away 20 of them, leaving Josh with 2 remaining pebbles. Therefore, Josh has 20 - 2 = 18 pebbles left in his collection now.
"Response:  If Josh had 19 marbles before and lost 11 of them, then he has fewer marbles now. So, his new number of marbles is less than 19. We can write this as:
Josh's current number of marbles = 19 - 11 = 8
Therefore, Josh currently has 8 marbles in his collection."
Response:  We know that Josh had 22 pebbles in his collection initially and lost 5 of them. So, he has 22 - 5 = 17 pebbles left now.
Response:  If Josh had 15 stones in his collection and he found 9 of them, then he must have lost 6 stones (15 - 9 = 6). So, Josh lost 6 more stones than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh has 3 balls in his collection initially and he lost 5 balls. So, the number of balls left with him is 3 - 5 = -2. Now, we find 6 additional balls while he was away, so the total number of balls found by him is 0 (since he didn't have any ball initially) + 6 = 6. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls Josh had at first and the number of balls he found is 6 - (-2) = 8.
Response:  The weight of each quail egg is about 0.5 oz or 14 grams (Marco's eggs are 9 kg / 28 eggs = 320 grams per egg). So, if we convert 4 pounds to grams, we get: 4 lb x 0.453592 g/lb = 1766.4 g. Now, let's compare the weights of Marco's and his father's quails eggs:  Weight of Marco's eggs = 320 g x 28 eggs = 8,960 g Weight of his father's eggs = 1766.4 g Therefore, Marco's eggs are heavier than his father's eggs by approximately 9,095.6 g (or 9.1 kg).
Response:  The weight of Marco's watermelons is given as 13 pounds ( lb). We are asked to find out how much heavier than his father's watermelons they are. To do this, we need to convert both weights from pounds to kilograms ( kg), since that is the unit used in the problem.  So, let's convert 13 lb to kg: 13 lb = 5.9 kg (using the conversion factor 1 lb = 0.4536 kg) Now, let's convert the weight of his father's watermelons: According to the problem, his father's watermelons weigh 10 kg. So, we can convert it to pounds using the same conversion factor: 10 kg = 22.04 lb (using the conversion factor 1 kg = 2.204 lb) Now, we can compare the two weights directly: 13 kg (Marco's watermelons) - 22.04 kg (his father's watermelons) = -9.04 kg (-12.04 lb) Therefore, Marco's watermelons are 9.04 kg or 12.04 lb heavier than his father's watermelons.
Response:  We know that the total weight of Marco and his father's watermelons is 20 pounds (or 9 kg). Since Marco's watermelon weighs 5 kg, his father's watermelon must weigh 14 kg (20 - 5 = 14).
Response:  We know that Marco's father has 32 pounds of watermelon and Marco has 8 pounds of watermelon. To find out how many watermelons they have in total, we can divide their weight by the weight of one watermelon. So, if we divide 32 pounds (Marco's father) by 8 pounds (Marco), we get 4 watermelons. Therefore, Marco and his father together have 4 watermelons.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to pick apples together and collected 7 kg of apples. On their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds (or 4 kg) of apples. So, the weight of the apples left with Marco is 7 kg - 4 kg = 3 kg. Therefore, the weight of the apples left with Marco's father is 7 kg + 3 kg = 10 kg.
Response:  At first, Marco and his father went to collect persimmons together. They collected 10 kg of persimmons. On their way back home, Marco's father reduced 2 kg of persimmons. Now, Marco has 5 kg of persimmons left. So, the weight of persimmons that Marco has is 5 kg.
"Response: 
Marco and his father collected 22 pounds of persimmons on their trip. When they returned home, Marco's father found additional 30 pounds of persimmons. Therefore, the total weight of persimmons collected is:

Total weight = 22 + 30 = 52 pounds

So, the weight of each persimmon is:

Weight per persimmon = Total weight / Number of persimmons = 52 pounds / 60 persimmons (since there are 60 persimmons in total) = 0.87 pounds per persimmon"
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 37 pounds of watermelon (since each of their watermelons weighs 5 kg). Therefore, if Marco has x kilograms of watermelon, then his father must have 37 - x kilograms of watermelon. Since the total weight of both watermelons is equal to 37 pounds, we can set up the equation:
x + (37 - x) = 37... (1)
Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting x from both sides gives us:
(37 - x) = 0... (2)
Dividing both sides by 37 gives us:
x = 10... (3)
Therefore, Marco has 10 kilograms of watermelon."
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's watermelons is 30 pounds. If together they weigh 17 pounds, then the weight of each watermelon must be equal to 30/2 = 15 pounds. So, the weight of Marco's watermelon is 15 pounds more than his father's watermelon. Therefore, the answer is (15 - x), where x is the weight of his father's watermelon.
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father's watermelons is given as 26 pounds ( lb). Since Marco has 5 kg watermelons, he contributes 5/10 of the total weight to be carried together with his father's watermelons. Therefore, the weight of Marco's watermelons is equal to 5/10 x 26 = 13 lb. Now we know that the combined weight of Marco and his father's watermelons is 26 lb + 13 lb = 39 lb. So, the difference between the weight of Marco's watermelons and his father's watermelons is 39 - 13 = 26 lb.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 30 pounds of watermelon (which is equal to 13.6 kg). Since Marco has more than half of the total weight of watermelon, he must have at least 13.6/2 = 6.8 kg of watermelon. So, the weight of each watermelon of Marco is approximately 6.8 kg / 2 = 3.4 kg.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 children on the bus. Then, more children got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus after they got off is 10 - 2 = 8 more than before they got off. Therefore, there are 8 more children on the bus after they got off than there were initially.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children on the bus. Then, 38 more children got on the bus at the stop. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 3 children on the bus (the initial number). Then, 2 more children got on the bus at the stop (the second number). So, the total number of children on the bus after they got on is:  Initial number + Second number = 3 + 2 = 5 children on the bus after they got on. Therefore, before they got off, there were 41 - 5 = 36 children on the bus.
Response:  We know that there are initially 43 children on the bus.  At the stop, some of them get off the bus. So, the number of children left on the bus is 21. To find out how many children got off the bus at the stop, we can divide the number of children left on the bus by the total number of children initially on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the stop is: Number of children who got off = Total number of children initially on the bus - Number of children left on the bus = 43 - 21 = 22
Response:  At first, there were 41 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the stop. After that, there were 18 children left on the bus. So, before they got off, there were more than 18 children on the bus (since we know that 18 is less than 41). Therefore, the answer is greater than 18.
Response:  We know that there are initially 21 children on the bus. Then, 10 of them get off at a stop, leaving 11 children still on the bus. Finally, some of these 11 children get off at another stop, leaving 16 children still on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off at the second stop is equal to 16 - 11 = 5.
Response:  There are 5 children getting off the bus and 63 children getting on the bus at the stop. So, there are 68 children (5 + 63) on the bus now. Since some of these children may have gotten off the bus again after passing another stop, let's assume that 14 children got off the bus at this stop. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus is equal to the number of children who got off the bus minus the number of children who got off at this stop, which is 68 - 14 = 54.
Response:  We know that there are 36 children on the bus initially and 68 children get off at the stop. So, the number of children left on the bus is: 36 - 68 = -32.  Therefore, there are more children getting off the bus than getting on it, i.e., 12 children.
Response:  We know that there are initially 22 children on the bus and then 40 more get on at the stop. So, in total, we have 62 children (22 + 40). Now, some of them get off the bus, leaving 2 children behind. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children left on the bus minus the initial number of children on the bus, which is 60 - 22 = 38.
Response:  There are initially 28 children on the bus. Then, 8 more children get on the bus at stop 82 (total = 36). However, some of these children got off the bus at stop 82, so there are actually fewer children left on the bus (total = 30). Therefore, there are 6 more children who got on the bus than got off the bus (36 - 30 = 6).
Response:  There are initially 23 children on the bus and then 8 more get on the bus. So, in total, there are 23 + 8 = 31 children on the bus at one time. Therefore, there are more children getting off the bus than getting on the bus.
Response:  If Baker has made 133 pieces of bread and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than 51 - 133 = 82 pieces of bread that he did not sell. Therefore, Baker has made 82 + 51 = 133 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  If Baker has made 54 bánh nướng and sold some of them, then he must have had 54 - x bánh left after selling some. Here, x is the number of bánh nướng that Baker sold. Since Baker sold 13 bánh nướng, we can write: 54 - 13 = 41. So, Baker had 41 bánh nướng left after selling some.
Response:  If the baker has sold 145 pieces of bread and he still has 72 pieces left, then he must have made a total of 217 pieces of bread (145 + 72 = 217).
Response:  If the friend of the baker buys 140 pieces from him, then the total number of pieces sold is 155 - 140 = 15. So, the baker still has 15 pieces left.
Response:  If he made 121 bánh nướng and sold 105 of them, then he has 16 (121 - 105) remaining.  He also bought 170 new bánh nướng, so now he has a total of 336 (16 + 170) bánh nướng left.
"Response: 
The baker made 13 bánh and sold them all. Then he bought 91 new bánh and sold 154 more. So, in total, the baker bought 91 + 154 = 245 new bánh. Since he already had 13 bánh, the total number of bánh that the baker has now is 13 + 245 = 258 bánh. Therefore, the baker buys more bánh than he sells."
Response:  If Banh has made 170 bánh and sold 78 of them, then he still has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92).  If he bought 31 new bánh, that means he now has 92 + 31 = 123 bánh in total. So, Banh sold more bánh than he bought.
Response:  The first batch of bread produced 110 pieces, and the baker sold 75 of them. So, there are remaining 35 pieces of bread left (110 - 75 = 35). When he made additional 76 pieces of bread, he now has a total of 35 + 76 = 111 pieces of bread in stock.
"Response: 
The first time, the baker made 144 bánh and sold 71 of them. So he had 73 remaining (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made another 111 bánh and sold none of them. Therefore, the total number of bánh that the baker has is equal to the original amount plus the additional ones he made but didn't sell: 73 + 111 = 184."
Response:  If Baker has already made 149 bánh and sold 91 bánh ngọt, then he still has 58 bánh left (149 - 91 = 58).  If he sells 10 more bánh, he will have 58 - 10 = 48 bánh left.
"Response:  If Baker has already made 7 bánh and sold 148 sweet dishes, then he still has x bánh left to sell. Since he wants to sell 15 more bánh, we can set up the equation:

x + 15 = 148... (1)

Now, let's solve for x using substitution method. We know that the total number of bánh Baker has is equal to the number of bánh he has left to sell plus the number of bánh he wants to sell in addition to what he has already sold:

Total bánh = x + 15

Substituting Equation (1) into this equation, we get:

x + 15 = 148

Simplifying, we have:

2x + 15 = 148

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

2x = 133

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 66

Therefore, Baker has 66 bánh left to sell after selling 7 bánh and 148 sweet dishes."
Response:  If Baker has made 126 bread rolls and 48 sweet pastries, then he has made a total of 174 items (126 + 48).  If he sells 115 bread rolls and 81 sweet pastries, then he has sold a total of 196 items (115 + 81).  Therefore, Baker has made more bread rolls than sweet pastries (196 - 174 = 22).
Response:  If Baker made 19 bánh and 131 món bánh ngọt in total, then he made 131 - 19 = 112 món bánh ngọt after making 19 bánh.  Now, if Anh makes 70 bánh and Baker makes 88 bánh ngọt, then Anh will make 70 - 19 = 51 bánh more than Baker. Therefore, Baker made 112 - 51 = 61 món bánh ngọt more than Anh.
Response:  If Baker has sold 158 pieces of bread and 147 sweet dishes, then he has sold a total of 158 + 147 = 305 items.  Since he started with 157 bread rolls and 169 sweet doughs, he must have sold at least 305 - 157 - 169 = 129 items. Therefore, Baker has sold more than 129 items.
Response:  If Baker has already made 54 pieces of bread and 143 sweet dishes, then he has a total of 54 + 143 = 197 items available for sale.  If he sells 68 pieces of bread and 92 sweet dishes, then his new total is 68 + 92 = 160 items sold.  Therefore, Baker sells more bread than before (68 - 54 = 14) and more sweet dishes as well (92 - 143 = -51).
Response:  At first, Mr. Tran made 48 bánh bán. Then he gave away 44 of them, leaving him with 4 remaining. So, the number of bánh bán left with Mr. Tran is 4.
Response:  If Mr. Baker initially made 40 pieces of bread and then sold 8 more, that means he has produced a total of 40 + 8 = 48 pieces of bread in total. So, if he sold all 48 pieces of bread, he would have made $48 / $1 = $48 in profit.
"Response:  If the friend of the baker bought 137 pieces from him initially and the baker made 169 pieces in total, then we can find out how many more pieces the baker made as follows:

Total number of pieces = Initial number of pieces + Number of pieces sold to friend
= 169 + 137
= 306

Therefore, the baker made 306 - 137 = 169 additional pieces beyond what the friend bought."
"Response: 
The baker made 173 bánh before and bought 103 new ones. So he has (173 - 103) = 70 remaining bánh from his previous batch. He sold 86 of them, leaving him with (70 - 86) = 4 bánh left over after selling. Therefore, the baker now has 4 bánh left."
Response:  If he made 99 bánh nướng and sold 89 of them, that means he has 99 - 89 = 10 remaining bánh nướng left over after selling.  Now, if he bought 167 new bánh mì, then he must have purchased more than the number of bánh nướng he had left over (10) because he needed to make up for the ones he sold. So the difference between the number of bánh mì he bought and the number of bánh nướng he had left over is equal to the number of bánh mì he bought minus the number of bánh nướng he had left over.  Therefore, the answer is:  He bought more than 10 bánh nướng.
Response:  If Banh has made 8 bánh nướng and bought 139 new ones, then he has sold 56 (8 - 139) bánh nướng.  If he sold 145 bánh nướng in total, then he must have sold 91 more than he bought (145 - 56 = 91). So, Banh sold 91 more bánh nướng than he bought.
"Response:  The baker made 62 bánh initially and then added another 149 bánh to make in total. He sold 144 of them. So, the number of remaining bánh is:

Remaining bánh = Total bánh - Sold bánh
= 62 + 149 - 144
= 7

Therefore, the baker has 7 more bánh left."
"Response: 
The first time, the baker made 81 bánh and sold 46 of them. So he has 35 left (81 - 46 = 35).  Then, he made another 92 bánh but only sold 46 of them again. So now he has 46 + 35 = 81 bánh left.  Therefore, the baker has more bánh than he originally had after making and selling both batches combined."
Response:  If Baker has already made 61 types of bread and 167 pieces of bread, then he must have used up all his ingredients to make those breads. Therefore, if he wants to make additional 108 pieces of bread, he will need more ingredients than before.  So, the number of new breads that Baker can make is equal to the difference between the total number of breads he can make (61 + 167 = 228) and the number of breads he has already made (61 + 44 = 105). Thus, Baker can make 123 new breads.
Response:  If Baker has already made 56 types of bread and 124 types of pastries, then he must have made at least 56 + 124 = 180 different types of baked goods in total.  Now, if he sells 104 pieces of bread and 29 types of pastries, we can calculate the number of remaining types of pastries as follows: Number of remaining pastries = Total number of pastries - Sold pastries = 124 - 29 = 95 So, there are 95 different types of pastries left that Baker has not sold yet.
Response:  If Baker has made 52 cakes and sold 84 of them, then he has left over 30 cakes (52 - 84 = 30).  If he sells another 102 cakes, he will have sold a total of 132 cakes (102 + 30 = 132).  Now, if he has also made 94 sweet breads, then he has a total of 226 items for sale (132 cakes + 94 sweet breads = 226). So, Baker has made more cakes than sweet breads.
Response:  If Baker has made 134 sweet bread rolls and 11 savory bread rolls, then he has made in total 145 bread rolls (134 + 11 = 145).  If he sells all of them, including both sweet and savory ones, then he will have sold 140 bread rolls (145 - 11 = 140). Therefore, Baker has made more bread rolls than he has sold.
Response:  If Baker has already made 14 cakes and sold 153 sweet dishes, then he must have sold at least 153 - 14 = 139 sweet dishes.  If he sells 8 more sweet dishes, then he will have sold a total of 139 + 8 = 147 sweet dishes.  Therefore, Baker sells more sweet dishes than cakes.
Response:  If Baker has already made 43 bánh and sold them all, then he has 43 - 15 = 28 remaining to sell.  Similarly, if he sells 114 more bánh ngọt, he will have 28 + 114 = 142 left to sell.  So, Baker sells more bánh ngọt than bánh ngọt.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games from Nintendo and she needs to buy 140 more games, then we can calculate it as follows:

Number of games Kelly has = 22
Total number of games needed = 140 - 22 = 118
So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games from Nintendo."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games from Nintendo and she plays 64 matches, then we have to subtract 64 from 106. So, Kelly will be left with 42 games.
Response:  If Kelly has played 91 games so far and still has 92 games to play, then she must have started playing the games with 0 games. So, the number of games she played initially is:  Number of games played initially = Total number of games - Games played so far = 92 - 91 = 1 Game Therefore, Kelly played one game initially.
"Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and wants to have 12 left after giving some away, we can start by finding out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away to reach her goal. We know that Kelly has 20 Nintendo games, so if she gives away x number of games, she will be left with 20 - x games. To find out how many games she needs to give away, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:

Let x = number of Nintendo games Kelly needs to give away

We want Kelly to have 12 Nintendo games left, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

20 - x = 12

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

-8 = x

So Kelly needs to give away 8 Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 12 left."
"Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to sell 31 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to sell, we can divide her total number of games (46) by the number of Sony games she wants to sell (31):

46 / 31 = 15

So, Kelly needs to sell 15 Sony games to have 31 remaining."
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she finds 31 more, then she now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. To find out how many games she needs to give away to have 6 remaining, we can divide the number of games she wants to keep (6) by the total number of games she has (111): 6 / 111 = 0.0545 or approximately 5 games. So, Kelly needs to give away approximately 5 games to have 6 remaining.
Response:  We know that Randy has 52 blocks and he uses them to build a tower. After building the tower, he has 38 blocks left. So, at first, Randy had 52 - 38 = 14 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks to build his tower. If he uses 72 of them, then we have 25 blocks left over (97 - 72 = 25). So, if Randy wants to use all of his blocks to build the tower, he will need 25 blocks more than he already has. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 houses and he uses 14 blocks to build one tower and 11 blocks to build another house. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of houses = Total number of blocks / Number of blocks used for each house. In this case, the total number of blocks is 79 (since there are 79 houses) plus 14 (the number of blocks used to build one tower) plus 11 (the number of blocks used to build another house). Therefore, we have: Number of houses = 79 + 14 + 11 = 104 houses. So, there are 104 houses in addition to the ones built with the given blocks.
"Response: 
Randy has 58 sets of houses (dãy). He uses 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build another house. So he used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks."
"Response: 
Randy has 37 rows of houses and he uses 33 blocks to build one tower and 13 blocks to build another house. So, if we divide the number of blocks used for building the tower (33) by the total number of rows of houses (37), we get:
$$ \frac{33}{37} = \boxed{0.9} $$
Therefore, Randy uses more than 9 blocks to build the tower compared to the number of blocks used to build the house."
Response:  For building a tower, Randy used 79 blocks. To build a house, he used 82 blocks more than for the tower. Therefore, to build a house, Randy used 79 + 82 = 161 blocks in total. So, Randy built more houses than towers.
"Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks to build a tower, and he wants to use 59 blocks in total, then we can calculate how many additional blocks he needs as follows:

Additional blocks needed = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used so far
= 59 - 36
= 23

Therefore, Randy needs 23 more blocks to complete his tower."
"Response: 
Randy has 95 blocks to build his house and he uses 20 blocks to build the house. So, he has 75 blocks left (95 - 20 = 75).
Now, he wants to use 50 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many blocks he will have left after building the tower, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks available: 75 - 50 = 25 blocks.
So, Randy has 25 blocks left after building both the house and the tower."
"Response: 
Randy has 90 houses to build and he uses 89 blocks to build one house. So, he needs 90 / 89 = 104 blocks to build all the houses.
Now, he uses 63 blocks to build a tower. Since he already used 104 blocks for building houses, he still has 63 - 104 = 41 blocks left to use for building the tower. Therefore, Randy uses more blocks to build houses than he does to build the tower."
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read 5 of them, then you have read __________ books. (Note: The blank represents the number of books that you have read.)
"Response:  We know that you have read 13 books from the series and there are 20 books in total. So, we can calculate the number of unread books as follows: Number of unread books = Total number of books - Number of books read = 20 - 13 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 books left to be read from the series ""Trường học điên rồ ngớ ngẩn""."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you have already read 12 books and watched 56 movies, then you still have how many books left to read?  So, the answer is 9 books (22 - 12 = 9)."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still have how many movies left to watch?  Therefore, the answer is 10 (19 - 7 = 12)."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 19 books and watch 13 movies, then we have:

Books: 16 + 19 = 35
Movies: 14 + 13 = 27
So, there are 35 books more than the number of movies in the series ""Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 19 books and watched 61 movies, then the number of movies more than books in the series is:

$$ \text {Number of movies more than books} = \text {Total number of movies - Total number of books} $$

We can substitute the values we have obtained from the question:

$$ \begin{align\*} \text {Number of movies more than books} &= \text {61 - 8} \\ &= \text {53} \end{align\*} $$

Therefore, there are 53 movies more than books in the series "" Crazy School"" if you read 19 books and watch 61 movies."
"Response:  If there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series "" Crazy School "", then reading 13 books means you have read more than half of them ( since 10 + 11 = 21, which is greater than 13 ). Therefore, if you watch 12 movies, you will have watched fewer movies than you have read books. So the difference between the number of books and movies you have watched is 1 ( since 13 - 12 = 1 )."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 7 books, then you have read more than half of the books (7/11 = 0.63). Similarly, if you watch 21 movies, then you have watched more than half of the movies (21/17 = 1.24). So, the answer is 1."
"Response:  We know that she has already read 8 books in the series "" Crazy School"". If there are a total of 14 books in the series, then we need to find out how many more books he needs to read. So, the answer is 6 (14 - 8 = 6)."
Response:  We know that there are 62 books in total and you have already read 4 of them. So, the number of books left to be read is:  62 - 4 = 58.  Now we know that you have watched 34 movies out of 19 (which means you have watched 19/3 = 6 movies remaining). Therefore, the number of movies left to watch is:  34 - 6 = 28.
Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies and 21 books in the series. If you read 7 books, then you have not seen any of the movies yet. So, if you want to see how many movies you can watch after reading 7 books, we need to subtract the number of movies you have already watched (0) from the total number of movies (8). Therefore, the answer is 8 - 0 = 8 movies.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 11 books and watch 40 movies, how many more books than movies are there in the series?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of books you read from the total number of books in the series. So, the answer is:  Books - Movies = Number of More Books Than Movies  In this case, the number of more books than movies is:  Books - Movies = 11 - 40 = 29  Therefore, there are 29 more books than movies in the series "" Crazy School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""School of Horrors"". If you read 13 books and watch 63 movies, then how many more movies are there than books in the series?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of books from the total number of movies. So, the answer is:  Movies - Books = 63 - 11 = 52 more movies than books in the series ""School of Horrors""."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 14 movies and watched 19 books, then you have watched more books than movies. So, the answer is 19 - 14 = 5 more books than movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series "" Crazy School"". If you read 19 movies and watched 16 books, then you have watched more movies than books. So, the answer is 19 - 16 = 3. Therefore, you have watched 3 more movies than books."
Response:  We know that Dave has already used some tickets to buy toys. So, he must have used at least 1 ticket for this purpose. Therefore, if he still has 2 tickets left, it means he has used a total of $ \text {at most} 1 + 2 = 3$ tickets to buy toys.
"Response:  We know that Dave has won some number of tickets (not specified in the problem). If he uses 12 tickets to buy toys, then he must have X tickets left over, where X is the difference between the total number of tickets he won and 12. So, we can write the equation:

X = Total tickets won - 12

We are also given that Dave has won more than 10 tickets. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation:

X > 10

Now, we need to find out what values of X satisfy this inequality. To do this, we can use algebraic manipulation or graphing techniques. For example, we could solve for X using the following inequality:

X > 10

X > 10

This gives us the solution:

X = 13

Therefore, if Dave has won more than 10 tickets and uses 12 tickets to buy toys, then he must have 1 ticket left over."
Response:  If Dave has already won 18 tickets and he uses 5 to buy stuff and 11 to buy clothes, then how many tickets does he have left? We can use subtraction to find out! So, if we subtract 5 from 18, we get 13. That means Dave has 13 tickets left after buying stuff and clothes.
Response:  If Dave uses 12 votes to buy toys and 7 votes to buy clothes, then he has used a total of 12 + 7 = 19 votes. So, Dave uses more votes to buy toys than to buy clothes. Therefore, the answer is (A) More than.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and uses 8 of them to buy toys, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5).  Now, if he uses 18 tickets to buy clothes, he will have used up all his remaining tickets (5 - 18 = -13). So, Dave has used more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys. Therefore, the answer is -13.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 times and lost 2 times, he must have $16 left after buying toys. So, if he spends $10 on toys, he will have $6 left ($16 - $10 = $6). Therefore, Dave still has 6 votes left.
Response:  If Haley planted 14 trees in her backyard and after the storm (which killed 9 trees), there are fewer than 14 trees left. So, we can say that 5 trees died during the storm (since 9 - 14 = 5).
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in her backyard before the storm hit and killed 6 of them. So, we have 7 surviving trees (13 - 6 = 7). Therefore, more than half of the original number of trees (7/13) survived the storm.
Response:  If Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and 4 of them were left behind after the storm, then we can say that 16 trees (20 - 4 = 16) were not affected by the storm. Therefore, 16/20 x 100 = 80% of the trees survived the storm.
"Response:  We know that after the storm (bão) passed away, there were only 12 trees left in Haley's backyard. So, if she planted x number of trees before the storm, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 12 = 12
Now, solve for x using basic arithmetic:
x = 12 - 12
x = 0
So, Haley did not plant any trees before the storm because there are no remaining trees in her backyard."
Response:  Initially, Haley had planted 9 trees in her backyard before the storm. After the storm, 4 of them died. So now she has 9 - 4 = 5 remaining trees. Then, she plants additional 5 trees, making the total number of trees she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees in her backyard.
Response:  Initially, Haley had planted 12 trees in her backyard. After two storms, one tree died, and another tree was uprooted. So, there were only 10 trees left in the backyard. Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
"Response:  If Haley had initially planted 3 trees in her backyard and 13 trees died during the storm, then the number of surviving trees is equal to the initial number minus the number that died. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Surviving Trees = Initial Number - Dead Trees
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Surviving Trees = 3 - 13
= -10
Therefore, there are -10 surviving trees in Haley's backyard after the storm."
Response:  Initially, Haley had planted 11 trees in her backyard. After the storm, two of them died. So, there are now 9 living trees left (11 - 2 = 9).
"Response:  If they harvest 66 baskets of rice per day and each basket contains 28 rice grains, then we can calculate the total number of rice grains harvested per day as follows:

Total number of rice grains = Number of baskets x Number of rice grains in each basket
= 66 x 28
= 1904

Therefore, they harvest 1904 rice grains per day."
Response:  If they harvest 8 baskets per day, it will take how many days to collect 24 baskets of rice?  Therefore, the answer is 3 days (24 / 8 = 3).
"Response:  If Mr. Nguyen knows that the harvest will continue for 4 days and they collect 56 bundles of cam per day in total, we can calculate the number of bundles collected each day as follows:

Day 1: 56 bundles / 4 days = 14 bundles per day

So, Mr. Nguyen collected 14 bundles of cam per day during the first day of the harvest."
Response:  If they harvest 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 apples, then in total they will have collected 38 x 42 = 1652 apples per day. Now, if they continue this process for 49 days, they will have collected a total of 1652 x 49 = 80,768 apples.
Response:  If they harvest 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 apples, then they will have collected 66 x 25 = 1650 apples in one day. Since there are 87 days left for them to collect apples, they will have collected a total of 1650 x 87 = 143,500 apples after 87 days.
"Response:  If they harvest 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 apples, then...

Answer: They harvest 8 x 35 = 280 apples per day."
Response:  If they harvest 16 baskets per day and each basket contains 57 apples, it means they will harvest 80 baskets in how many days?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of apples (80 baskets \* 57 apples/basket) by the number of days taken to harvest them. So, it will take 80 / 57 = 1.42 days to harvest 80 baskets of apples.
"Response:  If they harvest 67 baskets per day and each basket contains 12 apples, then the total number of apples harvested daily is:

67 baskets/day × 12 apples/basket = 804 apples/day

Now, if they harvest for 35 days in total, the total number of apples harvested is:

804 apples/day × 35 days = 28,200 apples

Therefore, there are 28,200 apples in total."
Response:  If they harvest 74 baskets per day and throw away 71 baskets per day, then after 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 3965 baskets (74 x 51 = 3965).
Response:  If they harvest 76 baskets per day and throw away 64 of them (which means they keep 12 baskets), then we can calculate how many quails they harvested per day as follows: Number of quails = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets kept per day So, in this case, the total number of baskets is 76 (the number they harvested) - 64 (the number they threw away). Therefore, the number of quails they harvested per day is: Number of quails = 76 / 12 = 6 quails per day
Response:  On day 1, they harvested 28 baskets of fully ripe cameras and 52 baskets that were not yet ripe. So, in total, they had 80 baskets (28 + 52) on the first day.  Now, let's assume that every day after that, they harvest the same number of baskets as they did on the first day. Therefore, on the second day, they will have 80 baskets again, and so on.  After 26 days, they will have collected 2040 baskets (80 x 26).
"Response:  If they harvest 82 baskets of ripe cam each day and there are 25 days left for harvesting, then the total number of baskets of ripe cam collected is:

82 x 25 = 2050 baskets
So after 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 2050 baskets of ripe cam."
Response:  If they harvest 31 baskets of fully ripe cameras per day and it takes 45 days to harvest all the cameras, then the total number of baskets of unripe cameras at any given time is equal to the total number of baskets of ripe cameras minus the number of baskets harvested each day. So, if they harvest 31 baskets of fully ripe cameras per day, then there will be 24 baskets of unripe cameras (31 - 31) left after one day. Therefore, after 45 days, there will be 24 x 45 = 1080 baskets of unripe cameras.
"Response:  If they harvest 44 baskets of ripe cam and 25 baskets of unripe cam each day, then the total number of baskets harvested per day is:

$$ Total = 44 + 25 = 69 $$
So, every day they harvest more than $ 69$ baskets of unripe cam."
"Response:  If there are 5 baskets of unripe persimmons and 74 baskets of ripe ones per day, then the number of unripe persimmons is equal to the total number of baskets per day minus the number of ripe ones per day. So we have:

Number of unripe persimmons = Total number of baskets - Number of ripe persimmons
= 5 + 74 = 89 baskets

Therefore, there are 89 baskets of unripe persimmons more than the number of ripe ones per day."
"Response:  If they have already harvested 54 baskets of rice in total, and they harvest 18 baskets per day, then we can calculate how many days it takes to harvest all 54 baskets as follows:

Number of days = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets per day
= 54 / 18
= 3 days

Therefore, if they start harvesting at this rate, it will take them 3 days to collect all 54 baskets of rice."
"Response:  If they harvested 56 baskets of cam in total and there are 14 days left for them to harvest, then we can calculate the number of baskets they will harvest per day as follows:

Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days left for harvesting
= 56 / 14
= 4 baskets per day
Therefore, they will harvest 4 baskets of cam per day."
"Response:  If they harvest 25 baskets of unripe cam each day and it takes 73 days for them to ripen completely, then the total number of baskets they will have after 73 days is:

$$ Total = \text {Number of baskets per day} \times \text{Days until ripe} $$

So, in this case, we can calculate the total number of baskets as follows:

Total = $ 25 \times 73 = 1825$ baskets
Therefore, after 73 days, they will have 1825 baskets of ripe cam."
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 65 = 390 unripe cam and 46 x 6 = 276 ripe cam. So in total, after 6 days of harvesting, they will have 390 + 276 = 666 cam left to be picked.
Response:  If there are 41 unripe cam and 86 ripe ones per day, then the total number of cam collected daily is:  Number of unripe cam = 41 Total number of cam collected daily = Number of ripe cam + Number of unripe cam = 86 + 41 = 127 cam Collected daily. So, for each day, more than 127 cam are collected than those that are not yet ripe.
"Response:  If there are 71 unripe cam and 60 ripe ones per day, then the number of unripe cam at the end of the day is:

$ Number of unripe cam = 71 $

Since there are already 60 ripe cam collected, the total number of cam collected that day is:

$ Total number of cam = 60 + 71 = 131 $

So, there are more than 30 unripe cam left over after collecting 60 ripe ones. The exact difference is:

$ Excess unripe cam = 131 - 60 = 71 $

Therefore, there are 71 excess unripe cam left over after collecting 60 ripe ones."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 12 feet and its width is given as 11 feet. To find out whether Jesse's room is longer or wider than her living room, we need to calculate their dimensions.  Length of Jesse's room = 12 feet Width of Jesse's room = 11 feet Now, let's compare these two values: Length of Jesse's room > Width of Jesse's room (since 12 > 11) Therefore, Jesse's room is longer than her living room.
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 meters long (or 6.6 feet). To find out how wide the room is, we need to divide its length by 3 (since there are 3 feet in a meter). So, the width of Jesse's room is:  
$$ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Length}}{3} $$
Substituting the value given in the problem, we get:  
$$ \text{Width} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.67\text{ meters} $$
Or, in feet:  
$$ \text{Width} = 0.67 \times 3 = 2.01\text{ feet} $$
So, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 2.01 feet."
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 meters wide and we want to find out how long it is. So, let's convert the width from meter to foot. There are 3.2808 feet in 1 meter, so Jesse's room is 6.5616 feet wide (2 x 3.2808). Now, we need to find out how many feet long Jesse's room is. To do this, we can multiply the width by the length of the room, which we were given as 14 feet. Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 90.72 feet (6.5616 x 14).
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 3 meters long and 5 meters wide. If she has already covered 16 square feet of floor space with her carpet, then we need to find out how much more area she needs to cover the entire house. To do this, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width In this case, the length of Jesse's room is 3 meters (m), and the width is 5 meters (m). So, the area of her room is: Area = 3 m x 5 m = 15 square meters (m^2) Now, we want to find out how many square meters of carpet Jesse needs to buy to cover the entire house. Since we know that the total area of the house is 30 square meters (m^2), which was given in the problem statement, we can set up the following equation: Area needed = Total area of the house - Area already covered By substituting the values we have found so far into this equation, we get: Area needed = 30 m^2 - 16 m^2 = 14 m^2 Therefore, Jesse needs 14 square meters of carpet to cover the entire house.
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. To cover the entire floor with tiles, we need to calculate how many tiles are needed based on the area of the room. The area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 2 feet x 12 feet = 24 square feet Now, let's convert this value into number of tiles. Since each tile has a size of 4 feet x 4 feet = 16 square feet, we can divide the total area of the room by the size of one tile to get the number of tiles needed: Number of Tiles = Total Area / Size of One Tile = 24 square feet / 16 square feet = 1.5 tiles Therefore, Jesse needs approximately 1.5 tiles to cover her entire room.
"Response:  We know that Jesse has 20 rooms and each room is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide. To cover all the floors of the house with carpets, we need to calculate how many square meters are needed for each floor.

For example, if we want to cover one floor with a carpet, we will need a rectangle with an area equal to the length times the width, which in this case would be 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we will need 20 x 36 = 720 square meters of carpet to cover all the floors of the house. Therefore, the answer is 720 square meters."
"Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 6 meters and its width is also given as 6 meters. To find out whether Jesse's room is longer or wider than 10 meters, we need to calculate their difference in length and width.

Length = 6 meters (given)
Width = 6 meters (given)

To find the difference between the length and width, we can use the following formula:
Difference = Length - Width
= 6 meters - 6 meters
= 0 meters

So, Jesse's room is neither longer nor wider than 10 meters."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 3 meters wide to cover her room. Since we are given that the length of the room is 5 feet, we can convert this value from feet to meters using the conversion factor of 0.3048 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). So, the length of the room in meters is:

Length = 5 feet x 0.3048 = 1.524 meters

Now, we need to find out how wide the room is. From the question, we know that the width of the room is equal to the length of the room times the width of the rug divided by 3. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:

Width = Length x Width of Rug / 3

Substituting the values we have obtained so far into this equation gives us:

Width = 1.524 meters x? / 3

We are asked to find out what value of? will give us the desired width of the rug. In other words, we want to solve for the unknown quantity?. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3, giving us:

Width = 1.524 meters / 3

Simplifying this expression gives us:

Width = 0.5076 meters

Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 0.5076 meters or 1.66 feet."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 3 meters wide to cover her room. Since we are given that one meter is equal to 1 foot, we can convert the width of the room from meters to feet as follows:

1 meter = 1 foot
So, the width of Jesse's room in feet is:

3 meters × 1 foot/meter = 3 feet
Now, we know that Jesse's room has a length of 2 feet, so its dimensions are:

Length = 2 feet
Width = 3 feet
Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is:

Length = 2 feet × 3 feet/meter = 6 feet
Answer: The length of Jesse's room is 6 feet."
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To cover the entire floor with carpet, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of each piece of carpet. So, we can calculate the number of pieces of carpet she needs as follows: Area of room = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sq ft Area of each piece of carpet = 18 sq ft / 80 sq ft = 2 pieces Therefore, Jesse needs two pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.
"Response:  We know that the store sold $23 per shirt and made $230 in total from selling the T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So we can write an equation as follows:

$ Sales = Number of Shirts x Price per Shirt

We are given that the number of shirts sold is equal to 230. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation above:

Sales = 230 x $23

Now we have our final answer:

Sales = $5190

Therefore, the store sold 230 T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, resulting in total sales of $5190."
"Response:  We know that Tiệm áo thun Razorback sold 3 shirts in total and made $51 from those sales. So, we can calculate the price of each shirt as follows:
Price of each shirt = Total amount earned / Number of shirts sold
= $51 / 3
= $17 per shirt
Therefore, the price of each shirt is $17."
Response:  We know that they sold $87 per shirt and they sold 95 shirts in total. So, if they sold 47 shirts in the Arkansas game, then their revenue from those shirts would be:  $87 x 47 = $4099.
Response:  We know that in the game against Arkansas, they sold $106 per shirt and sold a total of 242 shirts. So if they sold 115 shirts in the Arkansas game, then they sold $115 x 106 = $12,390 in revenue from those shirts alone. Now we need to find out how much they sold in the Texas Tech game. Since they sold 242 shirts in total, and they sold 115 shirts in the Arkansas game, then they must have sold $\frac{242}{2} = 121$ shirts in the Texas Tech game. Therefore, their revenue from selling shirts in the Texas Tech game is $12,390 + $121 = $12,511.
"Response:  We know that they sold $98 per shirt and they sold 163 shirts in total. So, if they sold 89 shirts in the Arkansas game, then their revenue from selling those shirts is:
$98 x 89 = $8,722
Therefore, they earned $8,722 from selling shirts during the Arkansas game."
"Response:  If they sold $78 per shirt in the Arkansas game and sold 186 shirts total, then their revenue from that game was:

$78 x 186 = $14,520

Now, if they sold $78 per shirt in the Texas Tech game as well, and sold 172 shirts, then their revenue from that game would be:

$78 x 172 = $13,096

So, the total amount of money they made from selling shirts at both games is:

$14,520 + $13,096 = $27,616"
"Response:  We know that the store sold 183 shirts and 31 shorts during the game.  The price of each shirt is $62, so the total revenue from shirts is:

$62 x 183 = $11,576

The price of each short is $99, so the total revenue from shorts is:

$99 x 31 = $3,049

Therefore, the total revenue from both shirts and shorts is:

$11,576 + $3,049 = $14,625"
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tiệm Razorback sold 74 shirts and 156 shorts in total during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.  Secondly, we are given that they earned $67 per shirt and $165 per short. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling these items can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Number of shirts x Price per shirt + Number of shorts x Price per shortTotal earnings = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165Total earnings = $49,820So, the answer is $49,820.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from shirts is $192 per shirt and $34 per sleeve. So, if we want to find out how much one shirt costs more than one sleeve, we can use the following formula: Revenue from one shirt - Revenue from one sleeve = Cost of one shirt relative to one sleeve. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: ($192 per shirt) - ($34 per sleeve) = $158 (per shirt). Therefore, one shirt costs $158 more than one sleeve.
Response:  We know that $86 is the price of one shirt and $232 is the price of one jacket. So if we want to find out how much more a jacket costs than a shirt, we can subtract $86 from $232: $$ 232 - 86 = 146$$ Therefore, one jacket costs $146 more than one shirt.
"Response:  The original price of each shirt is $51, and they sold 130 shirts during the game. So, the total revenue from selling shirts is:

$51 x 130 = $6,430

Now, after reducing the price by $8 per shirt, they sold additional 130 shirts, which means they earned an extra amount of money as follows:

$6,430 x (130/120) = $7,920

Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling shirts is:

$6,430 + $7,920 = $14,350"
"Response:  The price of each shirt is $201, and they sold 14 shirts in total. Therefore, the total revenue from selling shirts is:
$$ Total Revenue = Number of Shirts \times Price of Each Shirt $$
$Total Revenue = 14 \times 201 $
$Total Revenue = 2854 $
So, they earned $2854 from selling shirts."
Response:  If they earned $60 from selling each shirt and sold 10 shirts in total, then we can calculate their total earnings as follows:  Total earnings = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 10 x $60 = $600 So, they sold 600 shirts in total.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by the Arkansas store is $215. Since each shirt costs $30, we can calculate the number of shirts sold as follows:
$215 / $30 = 7 shirts
So, the Arkansas store sold 7 shirts in the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech."
"Response:  We know that each shirt costs $5 and each jacket costs $215. So if they sold 20 jackets and 64 shirts, their total revenue from selling these items would be:
Revenue = Number of jackets x Price per jacket + Number of shirts x Price per shirt
= 20 x $215 + 64 x $5
= $4300 + $320
= $4620
Therefore, the amount of money they earned from selling the shirts is $4620."
Response:  We know that each shirt costs $30 and each jacket costs $76. So, if they sold 158 shirts at $30 per shirt, they made $4,640 ($158 x $30). If they sold 2 jackets at $76 per jacket, they made $152 ($76 x 2). Therefore, in total, they made $4,792 ($4,640 + $152) from selling the clothes.
Response:  We know that one shirt costs $210 and one jacket costs $240. So, if we buy one shirt and one jacket together, their total cost is $210 + $240 = $450. Now, let's consider how much more expensive a jacket is than a shirt. If we divide the difference in price between a jacket and a shirt ($240 - $210) by the cost of a shirt ($210), we get the ratio of how much more expensive a jacket is compared to a shirt: $$ \frac {240-210} {210} = \boxed {16} $$ Therefore, one jacket costs 16 times more than one shirt.
Response:  We know that one shirt costs $25 and one jacket costs $115. So, if they sold 113 jackets and 78 shirts, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Jackets x Price of Jackets + Number of Shirts x Price of Shirts In this case, Total Revenue = 113 x $115 + 78 x $25 = $9,063 + $1,900 = $10,963 Therefore, one shirt costs less than one jacket.
Response:  If they have 5 tables and each table has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. So there are 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If there are total 12 seats in the backyard and each table has 4 chairs, then how many tables can they accommodate?  Therefore, each table has 3 seats (12 / 4 = 3).
Response:  If they have 3 chairs per table and want to accommodate 9 people in total, then they will need 9 / 3 = 3 tables. So, there are 3 beds of tables.
"Response:  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is:

11 x 13 = 143

So, there are 143 chairs in total."
Response:  If there are 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  If there are 11 people sitting at the tables, then some of the chairs will be empty. So, the number of empty chairs is equal to the total number of chairs minus the number of people sitting at the tables, which is 60 - 11 = 49. Therefore, there are 49 empty chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Since there are also 6 extra chairs for guests, the total number of chairs available for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs. Therefore, the family has 174 ghế (chairs) for their guests.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and each table has 3 seats, then we need to buy additional seats for 14 - 4 = 10 more guests. So, we need to buy 10 extra chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 tables and each table has 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. So, there are more than 9 chairs for every table.
Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in total over 5 weeks of harvesting, then he earned how much per week?  To find out, we can divide the total amount he earned ($460) by the number of weeks he worked (5):  $$ \frac {460} {5} = 92 $$ So, Lewis earned $92 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest season and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks the harvest season lasted as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 76 weeks
Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 76 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, his total income is:
$$ Total Income = 21 \times 216 = 4536 $$
Now, if he has to pay $702 in taxes, his net income will be:
$$ Net Income = Total Income - Taxes = 4536 - 702 = 3834 $$
So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $3834."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week for 223 weeks of harvest season, he will have earned a total of:
$$ Total = \text {Number of weeks} \times \text{Weekly income} $$
Total = 223 x $1357 = $294,611
So, if Lewis works for 73 harvest seasons, he will have earned a total of:
$$ Total = \text {Number of harvest seasons} \times \text{Total income from one harvest season} $$
Total = 73 x $294,611 = $20,833,733
Therefore, Lewis will have earned $20,833,733 if he works for 73 mùa thu hoạch."
Response:  If Lewis earns $28 per week for 109 weeks of harvesting and also makes $939 per week working extra hours, then his total weekly income can be calculated as follows: Total weekly income = Harvesting income + Extra hour income = $28 x 109 = $2,872 + $939 = $3,811 per week Now, if he works additional hours during the harvest season, his total weekly income will increase accordingly. Therefore, the answer is $3,811 per week.
Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting, then he has earned a total amount of: $$ Total = \times = $106,570$$ This is the total amount that Lewis has earned during his 233 weeks of harvesting.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks and has to pay $388 per week in rent, then he needs to calculate how much money he will have left after paying his rent each week. To do this, we can subtract the amount of rent he pays from his total earnings:
$368 - $388 = -$20
So, Lewis will have negative $20 each week after paying his rent."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks and has to pay $216 rent per week, then his total income is:
$491 x 1181 = $573,011
Now, let's calculate his total expenses:
$573,011 - ($216 x 1181) = $455,900
So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have:
$455,900 - $216 = $434,804
Therefore, Lewis will have $434,804 after paying $216 rent per week for 1181 weeks."
Response:  If Lewis earned $133 in total over 19 weeks, that means he earned an average of $7 per week. So, Lewis earned $7 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest season and he has earned a total of $178 so far, then we can calculate how many weeks have passed since the beginning of the harvest season as follows:

$2 x 4 weeks = $8 (Lewis has earned $8 in total)

So, if Lewis started working at the beginning of the harvest season, it means that he has worked for 4 weeks already. Therefore, the number of weeks that have passed since the beginning of the harvest season is:

4 weeks + 1 week = 5 weeks

Therefore, the vintage lasted for 5 weeks."
"Response:  If the depth of water is 10 times greater than Dean's height (which is 9 feet), then we can calculate the depth of water as follows:
Depth of water = 10 x Height of Dean = 10 x 9 feet = 90 feet
Therefore, the depth of water is 90 feet."
"Response:  We know that:
Dean is shorter than Ron by 8 feet (so Dean's height is less than 14 feet).
The water depth is twice the height of Dean (so the water depth is at least 2 x 7 = 14 feet).
Therefore, the water depth is at least 14 feet and less than or equal to 20 feet (since we assume that Ron stands at an elevation of 14 feet)."
"Response:  We know that:
Ron is 5 times taller than Dean. So if Dean is x meters tall, then Ron is 5x meters tall.
Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron. So Dean is (5x - 3) meters tall.
Ron stands at a depth of 12 feet. This means he is (12/0.91) = 13.47 meters deep in the water.
So we can set up the equation:
(5x - 3) + 13.47 = 0
Solving for x gives us:
x = 6.83 meters or approximately 22.4 feet."
Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron by 1 meter and 4 decimeters (or 1.4 meters). So if Ron stands at a depth of 13 feet (which is equal to 4.2 meters), then Dean will be at a depth of 17.6 meters (since he is 1.4 meters taller than Ron plus 4.2 meters for Ron's height). Therefore, the water depth where Dean is standing is 17.6 meters.
"Response:  We know that:
Ron is 9 feet (2.74 meters) shorter than Dean.
Dean is 16 times taller than Ron.
Ron stands at a depth of 13 feet (4 meters).
So we can write an equation based on these facts as follows:
Dean's height = 16 x (Ron's height - 9 feet)
Substituting Ron's height from the problem statement gives us:
Dean's height = 16 x (13 feet - 9 feet)
Simplifying and solving for Dean's height gives us:
Dean's height = 108 feet (33 meters)
Therefore, the water is 108 feet deep where Ron is standing."
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 9 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean's height is x feet, then the depth of the water is 9x feet.  Since Ron is taller than Dean by 6 feet, we can say that Ron's height is x + 6 feet. Now we need to find out how deep the water is relative to both Ron and Dean. For this, we will use the fact that the depth of the water is equal to the sum of the heights of both individuals. Therefore, the depth of the water is given by:  Depth = (Ron's height) + (Dean's height) = (x + 6) + x = 7x feet.  Finally, since the depth of the water is 9 times greater than Dean's height, we have:  Depth = 7x feet.  Substituting x = 15 (the height of Ron), we get:  Depth = 7(15) = 105 feet.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to divide them equally among two shelves, then each shelf will have how many books?  We can do this by dividing 34 by 2:  $34 \div 2 = 17$ So, each shelf will have 17 books.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each book costs $2, then...
"Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each shelf can hold 23 books, then the number of shelves needed to store all of Brian's books is:

27 / 23 = 3
So, Brian has 3 shelves full of books. Since each shelf can hold 23 books, the total number of books Brian has is:

3 x 23 = 69
Therefore, Brian has 69 books in total."
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book contains 10 shelves, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 shelves in total. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines per 10 shelves, then he has 90 / 10 = 9 magazines in total. Therefore, Brian has 9 magazines.
"Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

* Books: 23 x 29 = 657 books
* Magazines: 61 x 29 = 1749 magazines

So, Brian has a total of 657 books and 1749 magazines."
Response:  If Brian has 7 shelves with each shelf containing the same number of books, then he must have 7 x 7 = 49 books in total. Since there are 28 books in total, we can divide the total number of books by the number of shelves to find out how many books are in each shelf:  Number of books per shelf = Total number of books / Number of shelves = 49 / 7 = 6.7 (approximately) So, there are approximately 6.7 books in each shelf.
Response:  If Brian also looks at his bookshelf and each shelf contains 2 books, then there are 2 \* 2 = 4 shelves in total.  Since there are 38 books in total, we can divide it by 4 to find out how many shelves Brian has: 38 / 4 = 9 shelves. Therefore, Brian has 9 shelves of books.
Response:  If Carol sends out 10 invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each invitation requires 2 letters (one for the invitation itself and one for the RSVP), then she will need to send out a total of 2 x 10 = 20 letters. Therefore, Carol needs at least 4 packages of stationery (each containing 5 letters) in order not to leave any of her friends behind.
"Response:  Since Carol invited 12 friends to her birthday party and bought 3 gift boxes for each of them, the total number of invitation cards is:

12 x 3 = 36

So there are 36 invitation cards in total."
Response:  If Carol sends out 7 packages of invitations and each package contains 10 letters, then she has sent out a total of 7 x 10 = 70 letters in all.  Since she only wants to send birthday wishes to 2 friends, that means there are 70 - 2 = 68 unused letters left over after she sends them. Therefore, there are 68 unused letters left over.
Response:  If Carol buys 6 packages of invitations and each package contains 14 invitation cards, then she has bought a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitation cards.  After that, she buys an additional 11 invitation cards, so the total number of invitation cards she has is now 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, Carol can invite 95 people to her party.
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 9 people for her birthday party and each package of greeting cards contains 3 invitation cards, then she needs to buy additional 6 packages (or 18 invitation cards) to reach her target number of 9 guests. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Melissa scores 12 points in each match and she has played x matches, then her total score is 12x. To find out how many matches she has played, we can set up an equation using this information:  Total score = Score per match x Number of matches  So, if Melissa scored 36 points, we can substitute that value into the equation to solve for x: 36 = 12x  Divide both sides by 12 to isolate x: x = 30  Therefore, Melissa has played 30 matches.
"Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored an average of 81 points per game, then she must have scored:

Game 1: 81 points x 1 = 81 points
Game 2: 81 points x 2 = 162 points
Game 3: 81 points x 3 = 243 points

Therefore, Melissa scored a total of 81 + 162 + 243 = 586 points in her 3 games."
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each match and received 82 points as bonus for every match. So, her total score in one match is 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, we need to find out how many matches she played. According to the question, she played 79 matches. Therefore, her total score is 191 x 79 = 14,599 points.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game, then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 21 / 3 = 7 points per game Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  Since Melissa scored 91 points in total and got the same score (91) in each match, we can assume that she scored an average of 91/13 = 7 points per match. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in each match.
Response:  We know that there are 4 seats in each Ferris wheel car and 20 people can sit together at once. So, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many people can fit in one seat. Therefore, each seat can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5).
Response:  If there are 9 people per seat and 18 people can sit on the Ferris wheel at once, then we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats the Ferris wheel has. So, the number of seats on the Ferris wheel is:  18 / 9 = 2 seats. Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 2 seats.
Response:  We know that each Ferris wheel has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, we have: Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheels = Total number of seats / Number of people per seat = 19 seats / 15 people/seat = 135 people (since there are 20 Ferris wheels). So, 135 people can ride the Ferris wheels at the same time.
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is:

18 seats x 15 people/seat = 270 people
So, if 10 seats are broken, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is:

270 people - 10 seats = 260 people"
Response:  We know that there are 6 seats in total on the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park. Each seat can accommodate 14 people, so the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, then there are still 84 - 16 = 68 people who can join the ride.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, and each large seat can accommodate 54 people. So, if we want to know how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on the small seats, we need to multiply the number of small seats by the maximum capacity per seat:  Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel on the small seats = Number of small seats x Maximum capacity per seat = 2 x 14 = 28 people. Therefore, 28 people can ride the Ferris wheel on the small seats.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, and each large seat can accommodate 12 people. Therefore, we have:
Number of people who can ride bicycles on the large seats = Number of large seats \* Capacity per large seat
= 7 \* 12
= 84 people
So, there can be 84 people riding bicycles on the large seats."
Response:  If there are 16 people and each person can sit in one of the four seats on the Ferris wheel, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit in each seat. So, the answer is 16/4 = 4. Therefore, each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 4 people.
"Response:  If there are 4 people and each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold 2 people, then...

Answer: $ \boxed{8} $

Explanation:

The number of seats on the Ferris wheel is equal to the number of people who can ride it at once. Since there are 4 people riding the Ferris wheel, and each seat can hold 2 people, the total number of seats is:

$ 4 \times 2 = 8 $

Therefore, there are 8 seats on the Ferris wheel that can be occupied by riders."
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then the total number of slices is 7 x Number of slices per pizza = 7 x 8 = 56 slices. So, each slice of pizza has 56/7 = 8 mi...
Response:  If each pizza has 2 slices and there are total of 28 pieces, then we can calculate as follows: Number of pizzas = Total number of pieces / Number of slices per pizza So, in this case, Number of pizzas = 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas. Therefore, we have called 14 pizzas.
Response:  We have been called for 17 pieces of pizza. Each piece has 4 slices, so we have a total of 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. If there are 25 people, then each person will get how many slices of pizza? So, the number of slices of pizza per person is 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person.
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Now, if there are 2 people sharing them equally, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices. So, the answer is 45 slices per person.
"Response:  If Paige and her mother have planted 10 seeds in each of 45 flowerbeds, then they have planted a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of seeds} = \text{Number of seedlings per bed} \times \text{Number of flowerbeds} $$

So, the total number of seeds is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of seeds}} = \boxed{10} \times \boxed{45} = \boxed{450} $$

Therefore, there are 450 seeds in all."
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and there are 9 flowerbeds, then the number of seeds each bed contains is:  Number of seeds per flowerbed = Total number of seeds / Number of flowerbeds = 45 / 9 = 5.   So, each flowerbed has 5 seeds.
Response:  We know that Paige is helping her mother plant flowers and together they have planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower pot and only 58 flowers grew in each pot. So, how many flower pots do they have?  Therefore, the number of flower pots is 58 / 12 = 4.83 (round up to 5).
Response:  Since they planted 15 seeds in each petal and only 60 flowers grew in each petal, then the total number of flowers is: Total Number of Flowers = Number of Seeds x Number of Petals Total Number of Flowers = 15 x 3 = 45 flowers. Therefore, there are 45 flowers in total.
"Response:  If they planted 10 seeds in each flower bed and they have 60 seeds in total, then the number of flower beds is:

60 seeds / 10 seeds per bed = 6 flower beds
Therefore, there will be 6 flower beds with 60 seeds in total."
Response:  If Paige is helping her mother plant flowers in 8 flowerbeds and they have planted 32 seeds altogether, then we can assume that each flowerbed contains an equal number of seeds (since they are planting them together). Therefore, if there are x seeds in each flowerbed, then the total number of seeds in all 8 flowerbeds is 32 / 8 = 4x. So, the number of seeds in each flowerbed is 4x.
Response:  If Matthew gives each of his 11 friends 2 pieces of bread, then he will give a total of 2 x 11 = 22 pieces of bread. So, Matthew has 22 pieces of bread.
"Response:  If Matthew has 8 pieces of bread to give away and he wants to give each friend 2 pieces, then...

1. How many friends does Matthew have if he gives each one 2 pieces of bread?
2. How many pieces of bread will Matthew have left after giving them all 2 pieces each?
3. Therefore, how many people can Matthew give bread to in total?

So, the answer is:

1. Number of friends = 8 / 2 = 4 friends
2. Remaining bread = 8 - (4 x 2) = 8 - 8 = 0 pieces of bread
3. Total number of people Matthew can give bread to = 4 + 0 = 4 people

Therefore, Matthew can give bread to 4 people."
Response:  If Matthew has 15 pieces of bread and gives 5 friends an equal amount (since he still has 10 pieces left), then each friend will have eaten x/5 = 3 pieces of bread ( since there are 10 remaining). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Matthew has 24 cookies and he gives 3 of his friends an equal number of cookies each (let's call it x), then we know that Matthew still has x + 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 cookies left. So, Matthew gave his friends a total of 3x cookies.
Response:  If Matthew has 22 pieces of bread and he gives 11 friends an equal number of pieces, then the total number of pieces of bread given to the friends is 22 x 11 = 242 pieces of bread. Therefore, each friend will get 242/11 = 22 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Matthew has 29 pieces of bread and gives each of his two friends an equal number of pieces, then he will give them 14.5 pieces of bread each (since 29 / 2 = 14.5). So, each friend will have eaten 14.5 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Matthew has 14 pieces of bread and he gives 7 friends equal shares, then each friend will get how many pieces of bread?  To find out, we can divide 14 by 7: 14 / 7 = 2. Therefore, each friend gets 2 pieces of bread from Matthew. Now let's count how many pieces of bread are left after giving them to the friends. We have 14 - (2 x 7) = 14 - 14 = 0 pieces of bread left. So there are no leftover pieces of bread after giving them to the friends.
Response:  If Matthew has 36 pieces of bread and he gave equal shares to 18 friends, then each friend got how many pieces of bread?  We can solve this problem by dividing 36 by 18, which gives us the answer: Each friend got 2 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Matthew has 36 pieces of bread and he wants to share them equally among his friends, then each friend will get 36/x = 6 pieces of bread, where x is the number of friends. So, if Matthew has 36 pieces of bread and there are 5 friends, then each friend will get 36/5 = 7 pieces of bread (since we rounded down). Therefore, Matthew has shared 7 pieces of bread with each of his 5 friends.
Response:  We know that Matthew has 23 cookies and he gives some to his two friends. After giving them away, he is left with 11 cookies. So, we can say that before giving any cookies away, Matthew had x cookies (where x is the number of cookies Matthew initially had). Now, let's find out how many cookies each friend got. Since they divide the cookies equally among themselves, each friend gets x/2 cookies (since there are two friends and they share the cookies equally). Therefore, after Matthew gave the cookies away, he was left with 11 - (x/2) = 7 cookies. So, the value of x is 23.
Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 bánh quy initially and he gives away 5 to his friends. So, after giving them away, he has 31 - 5 = 26 bánh quy left. Now we are asked how many bánh quy Matthew gave to his friends. Therefore, the answer is 26 / 5 = 5 bánh quy.
"Response:  If Matthew has 32 bánh quy and he gives each of his four friends an equal amount (bánh quy), then the number of bánh quy given to each friend is:

$$ \frac{32}{4} = 8 $$
So each friend gets $8$ bánh quy from Matthew.
Now, let's calculate how many bánh quy Matthew gave in total:

$$ Total = 32 + 32 + 32 + 32 = 120 $$
Therefore, Matthew gave a total of $120$ bánh quy to all his friends together."
Response:  If Matthew has 10 pieces of bread and 8 pieces of bread, then he will have a total of 18 pieces of bread (10 + 8).  Since there are 4 friends in total, each friend will get 18 / 4 = 4.5 pieces of bread. So, each friend will eat 4.5 pieces of bread.
"Response:  If Matthew had 13 bread rolls and 15 bread sticks to share equally among his 28 friends, each friend would get:

Bread rolls: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 bread rolls per person)
Bread sticks: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 bread sticks per person)"
Response:  We know that Debbie drinks 109 cans of beer per day and each can contains 355 milliliters (mL). Therefore, she consumes a total volume of 38,265 mL (109 x 355) per day. If it takes 74 days to finish the beer, then the total volume consumed is equal to the number of days multiplied by the daily consumption volume: 38,265 mL x 74 = 2,826,550 mL. So, Debbie has bought approximately 2,826,550 mL of beer.
Response:  If Debbie drinks x chai of water per day when they are fresh and she consumes them for 17 days, then after 17 days, she will have consumed a total of x \* 17 = y liters of water. Since each can contains 500 ml, we can convert y to number of cans as follows: y = 500 ml / 500 ml/can = 2 cans per day. Therefore, Debbie drinks 2 cans of water per day.
"Response:  If Debbie drank 15 cans of soda per day for 11 days, she would have drunk a total of:

15 cans/day x 11 days = 165 cans

So, if there were originally 264 cans of soda and Debbie drank 165 cans, then there are:

264 - 165 = 99 cans left."
"Response:  We know that Debbie drank 301 cans of water in total and she consumed 144 cans per day for several days. To find out how many days she drank 157 cans, we need to subtract the number of days she drank 144 cans from the total number of days she drank water. So, the answer is:

Days = Total amount of water drunk - Amount of water drunk per day x Number of days she drank 144 cans
= 301 - (144 x Number of days she drank 144 cans)
= 301 - (144 x X)
where X is the number of days she drank 144 cans.
Solving for X, we get:
X = Days / 144
X = 301 / 144
X = 2
Therefore, Debbie drank 157 cans of water for 2 days."
Response:  If Debbie drank 88 cans of water and 13 cans of soda when they were first opened, then she has drunk a total of 88 + 13 = 101 cans of drinks so far.  If she continues to drink 4 cans of water and 87 cans of soda per day, how many days will her supply of water last?  We know that Debbie drinks 4 cans of water per day, which means she consumes 4 x 8 oz = 32 oz of water per day. Since there are 16 oz in a can of water, this means she has 32 / 16 = 2 cans of water left each day. Therefore, her supply of water will last for 2 days. Similarly, if she drinks 87 cans of soda per day, it means she consumes 87 x 12 oz = 1092 oz of soda per day. Since there are 16 oz in a can of soda, this means she has 1092 / 16 = 66 cans of soda left each day. So, her supply of soda will last for 66 days. In conclusion, Debbie's supply of water will last for 2 days, and her supply of soda will last for 66 days.
"Response:  If Debbie drank 312 cans of water and 4 cans of soda per day, then she would have drunk in total:

Water: 312 x 4 = 1256 cans
Soda: 4 x 312 = 1248 cans

Since there are initially 256 cans of soda available, we need to subtract the number of cans Debbie has consumed from the initial amount:

Available soda after Debbie drinks them = Initially available soda - Number of cans Debbie consumed
= 256 - (1248 - 1256)
= -96

Therefore, after Debbie drinks all the soda, there will be -96 cans of soda left."
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 cans of water per day and buys a total of 12 cans of water, then she will be able to use them for how many days?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of cans of water that Debbie has bought (12) by the number of cans of water that she drinks per day (6). This gives us a ratio of 12/6 = 2.  So, if Debbie buys 12 cans of water, she will be able to use them for 2 days.
"Response:  We know that Debbie drank 15 cans of water and 54 cans of soda per day. The total amount of drink she consumed is:

Water = 15 x 330 ml/can = 4,950 ml/day
Soda = 54 x 330 ml/can = 17,640 ml/day
Total = 4,950 + 17,640 = 22,590 ml/day
Now we need to find out how many days the bottles will last based on this consumption rate. To do this, we divide the total amount of drink consumed by the capacity of each bottle:

For water: 22,590 ml / 950 ml/bottle = 24 days
For soda: 22,590 ml / 180 ml/bottle = 125 days
Therefore, if Debbie continues to consume these amounts of water and soda every day, the bottles of soda will last for approximately 125 days, while the bottles of water will last for approximately 24 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie drank 122 cans of water and 9 cans of soda in total. If she drinks one can per day, then it will take her 122 days to finish the soda. Therefore, the number of days the soda will last is:
$$ \therefore Days = {122} $$
So, the answer is $122$ days."
"Response:  We know that Faye has 11 pens in each row and she places them horizontally, so the total number of pens is:

11 x 14 = 154

Therefore, Faye has 154 pens in total."
"Response:  Since there are 12 pens in total and Faye wants to arrange them into 3 rows, we can start by dividing the number of pens by 3. So, the number of pens in each row is:

12 / 3 = 4

So, Faye will have 4 pens in each row. Therefore, the answer is:

Faye has 4 pens in each row."
"Response:  If Faye has 16 bút chì in each row and she can make 28 rows of bút chì, then the total number of bút chì she can make is:

16 (bút chì per row) x 28 (rows made) = 432 (total number of bút chì)
Therefore, Faye can make 432 hangers of bút chì."
"Response:  We know that Faye has 22 bút chì in each row and 6 rows in total. Therefore, the number of bút chì Faye has is:

$$ Numberofbútchì = 22 \times 6 = 132 $$
So, Faye has 132 bút chì in total."
"Response:  If Faye has 35 pens and she wants to arrange them in rows of 5 pens each, then she can make:

$$ \text {Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total number of pens}}{\text{Number of pens per row}} $$

Given that there are 5 pens in each row, we have:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of rows} &= \frac{35}{5} \\ &= 7 \end{aligned} $$

So, Faye can make 7 rows of pens."
Response:  We know that Faye has 19 rows of pencils and each row contains 4 black pencils and 27 colored pencils. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of black pencils = Number of rows x Number of black pencils per row = 19 x 4 = 76Total number of colored pencils = Number of rows x Number of colored pencils per row = 19 x 27 = 503Therefore, Faye has 76 black pencils and 503 colored pencils in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 rows of pencils in total and each row has 36 black pencils and 30 colored pencils. Therefore, the total number of black pencils is 7 x 36 = 252, and the total number of colored pencils is 7 x 30 = 210. So, Faye has 252 black pencils and 210 colored pencils in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 31 pens and 27 colored pens in each row. Since there are 11 rows, we have:
Pens = 31 x 11 = 341
Colored Pens = 27 x 11 = 297
So, Faye has 341 pens and 297 colored pens in total."
Response:  If Faye has placed 30 pens in a row with 5 pens in each row, then she has placed 30 x 5 = 150 pens in total. So, Faye can make 150 rows of pens.
Response:  If Faye has 6 pens and she wants to place them in two rows of equal length, then we can assume that each row will have 3 pens (since there are 2 rows). So, if Faye places 3 pens in the first row and 3 pens in the second row, how many pens will be placed in each row?  Therefore, the answer is 3 pens per row or 6 pens total.
Response:  Since there are 35 gói bút chì in total and each gói has 4 bút chì, we have a total of 35 x 4 = 140 bút chì.  Now, since Faye wants to arrange them into rows with 2 bút chì in each row, she can make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 70 rows of bút chì.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 31 boxes of pencils and each box contains 6 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is:

31 boxes x 6 pencils/box = 186 pencils
So, Faye has 186 pencils in total."
Response:  We know that Faye has 71 pencils in total and she wants to arrange them into 30 rows. So, we need to divide 71 by 30 to find out how many pencils are in each row.  Therefore, there are 2.36 pencils in each row (71 / 30 = 2.36). Now, let's count the number of rows based on the information given in the question:  Number of rows = Total number of pencils / Number of pencils in each row  Number of rows = 71 / 2.36 = 30 rows  Therefore, Faye has 30 rows of pencils with 2.36 pencils in each row, for a total of 69.8 pencils (30 x 2.36 = 69.8).
"Response:  We know that Faye has 16 rows of pencils and each row contains 6 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:

16 x 6 = 96
So, Faye has 96 colored pencils in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and 98 students in total. Since each class has at least one teacher, we can assume that all 21 classes have at most 98 students (since some classes may have fewer than 30 students). Therefore, the maximum number of students any one bus can carry is:

$$ \text{Maximum capacity} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of buses}} $$

We are given that there are 7 buses, so we can plug in the values to find the maximum capacity per bus:

$$ \boxed{\text{Maximum capacity per bus}} = \frac{\text{98 students}}{\text{7 buses}} = 14 students } $$

Therefore, each bus can carry up to 14 students."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each bus can accommodate 118 students. So, we need to divide 84 by 118 to find out how many buses are needed for all the classes. Therefore, the number of buses required is:

$ \boxed{84 / 118 = 7} $
So, there are 7 buses needed for all the classes in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in total and each class has 66 students. Therefore, we have:
Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class
= 67 x 66
= 4302 students
Now, let's assume that they will use 6 seats per bus for transportation. To find out how many buses they need, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus:
Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus
= 4302 students / 6 seats/bus
= 717 buses
Therefore, based on the information provided, the school needs 717 buses to transport all 4302 students for their field trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in total and each class has 58 students. So, we have to divide the number of students among the buses. Since each bus can accommodate 2 students per seat, we need to divide 58 students by 2 seats per student to find out how many students each bus can carry. Therefore, the number of buses needed is:

Number of buses = Number of students / Number of students per bus
= 58 students / 2 students per bus
= 29 buses
Therefore, the answer is 29 buses."
"Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total and each class has the same number of students (120). Therefore, we can divide 120 by 24 to find out how many students are in each class:

$$ \boxed{\therefore 5} $$
So, each class has approximately 5 students."
Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in the school and 102 students in total. Since each bus can accommodate 8 students, we need to divide the number of students by 8 to find out how many buses are needed: Number of buses = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 102 students / 8 students per bus = 13 buses Therefore, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, we will need 13 - 22 = 9 more buses.
Response:  If there are 102 classes in the school and 11 students in total, then each bus can accommodate 99 students (since there are 99 seats per bus).  If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, that means they will stay behind at the school. So, the number of students who will go on the field trip is equal to 102 - 8 = 94 students. Therefore, 94 students will go on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each bus can accommodate 3 students. Therefore, we need to divide 72 by 3 to get the number of buses needed:

72 / 3 = 24

So, we need 24 buses to transport all 111 students for the field trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 classes in the school and each class has an average of 5 students per class (given). Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is:

$$ \text {Total number of students} = \frac{17}{5} \times 92 = 384 $$
Since there are 46 buses for the entire school, we can calculate the maximum capacity of each bus as follows:

$$ \text {Maximum capacity of each bus} = \frac{384}{46} = 8.33 \text {students} $$
So, each bus can carry approximately $8.33$ students at most."
Response:  If there are 11 students in Haley's class and they all like playing soccer, then the total number of students who want to play soccer is 11.  Now, if Haley gives each student 9 balls to play with, then the total number of balls she will give out is 11 x 9 = 99 balls. Therefore, Haley has 99 balls to distribute among the 11 students in her class.
"Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and she gives each of the boys 5 balls, then the total number of balls given to the boys is:

10 (balls) x 5 (balls per boy) = 50 balls
So, Haley gave 50 balls in total to the boys."
Response:  If there are 23 boys in total and Haley wants to keep 15 of them for herself, then we need to divide 23 by 15. So, each boy will receive how many?  Yes, that's right! Each boy will get 1.5 (23 / 15) spots.
Response:  If there are 13 children who like playing football and 50 children who like playing cards, then we can say that each child likes playing either football or cards (not both). So, in total, there are 13 + 50 = 63 children. Now, if Haley has 26 balls to distribute equally among all the children, then each child will get 26/63 = 0.403 balls. Therefore, each child will receive approximately 4 balls.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and wants to divide them equally among her classmates so that each boy gets an equal number of marbles, then we need to find out how many marbles each boy will get.

We know that there are 2 boys in total who like to play with marbles. So, if we divide 20 marbles equally between them, each boy will get 10 marbles (20 / 2 = 10)."
Response:  If Haley has 28 balls and she wants to give each of her students 2 balls, then how many students does she have?  We can deduce that from the information given in the problem statement. So, if Haley has 28 balls and wants to give each student 2 balls, then she must have 14 students (28 / 2 = 14).
"Response:  If Frank is reading his favorite book for 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish the book as follows:

Days = Total Pages / Daily Reading Pages
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank will need approximately 27 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads 14 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank reads 22 pages per day and it takes him 569 days to finish the book, then he has read a total of:

Pages read per day = 22
Days taken to finish the book = 569
Total number of pages read = Pages read per day x Days taken to finish the book
= 22 x 569
= 12,038 pages
Therefore, there are 12,038 pages in the book that Frank is reading."
"Response:  Since Frank took 6 days to finish reading his favorite book, which has 612 pages divided into 24 chapters, we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages in the book x Total time taken to finish the book
= 612 x 6
= 3672 pages

Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took Frank to finish reading the book:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish the book
= 3672 / 6
= 612 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 612 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to complete the book, and the book has 555 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages per chapter as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to complete the book Chapter length = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Number of chapters = 555 pages / 220 days = 2.53 chapters Chapter length = 555 pages / 2.53 chapters = 217 pages per chapter
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to complete his favorite book of 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read each day, we can use the following formula: Number of chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Time taken to complete the book In this case, the total number of chapters is 15, and the time taken to complete the book is 660 days. So, if we divide 15 by 660, we get the number of chapters Frank read each day: Number of chapters read per day = 15 / 660 = 0.023 or approximately 2 chapters per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately 2 chapters per day during the 660 days it took him to finish his favorite book.
Response:  If Frank takes 3 days to finish each book and each book has 249 pages, then he reads how many pages per day? We can calculate this as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in all books / Time taken to complete all books In this case, the total number of pages in all books is 249 x 3 = 747 pages. So, if it takes Frank 3 days to complete all the books, he will have read 747/3 = 249 pages per day. Therefore, the answer is 249 pages per day.
Response:  If it takes Frank 12 days to read one book, then he will take 66/12 = 5.5 days to read each of the remaining books. Therefore, if Frank reads all the books, it will take him 5.5 x 30 = 165 days to finish reading all the books. So, Frank has read 30 books in total.
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book, and the book has 112 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book each day for 16 days."
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then he will finish reading the book in:

Time = Number of pages / Number of days to read
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank will take 72 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads 8 pages per day."
Response:  Since Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book, we know that he read for x number of days.  We are also given that each chapter has 450 pages, so the total number of pages in the entire book is 450x.  Therefore, if Frank reads x pages per day, then he will take x/30 days to finish the entire book. So, the answer is x = 13750 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to complete his favorite book. Since each chapter has 3 chapters, we can calculate the number of chapters as follows: Number of chapters = Total pages / Number of days taken = 3 x 594 = 1782 chapters Now, since there are 3 chapters in each chapter, we have: Number of pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters = 594 / 1782 = 3.35 pages per chapter Therefore, each chapter in Frank's favorite book contains approximately 3.35 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish reading the book Time taken to finish reading the book = 664 days x 24 hours/day = 15,976 hours Therefore, if Frank reads one chapter per day, he will take 15,976 / 405 = approximately 38.8 years to finish reading his entire book. So, the answer is 38.8 years.
Response:  We know that there are 6 gói DVD in total and each gói costs $120. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of one gói as follows: Cost per gói = Total cost / Number of gói = $120 / 6 = $20 per gói. So, the answer is $20 per gói.
"Response:  If each package costs $81 dollars, then to buy 33 packages of DVDs, we need to multiply the cost of one package by 33:

$81 x 33 = $2693

Therefore, it will cost $2693 to buy 33 packages of DVDs if each package costs $81 dollars."
Response:  If each DVD costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 off each one, then we can calculate how many DVDs you can buy with $93 as follows: Number of DVDs = Total amount available for purchase - Cost of each DVD Total amount available for purchase = $93 x (Number of DVDs) Cost of each DVD = $107 So, to find out how many DVDs you can buy with $93, we need to divide the total amount available for purchase by the cost of each DVD: Number of DVDs = $93 / $107 = 85/2 = 42.5 DVDs Therefore, you can buy 42.5 DVDs with $93.
Response:  If each DVD costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 for each DVD, then we can calculate the price after the discount as follows: Price = Original price - Discount Price = $76 - $25 = $51 So, to buy one DVD, you would have to pay $51.
"Response:  If Anh has $104, then he can buy __________ gói DVD. 

$104 / $26 = _______ gói DVD"
Response:  We know that there are 28 dollars in total and we want to find out how much each DVD costs. So, let's divide the total amount of money by the number of DVDs: $28 / 2 = $14 per DVD. Therefore, with 28 dollars, you can buy 2 DVDs.
Response:  Since there are 18 coconuts in total and we want to group them into groups of size 2, we can start by dividing them equally among 9 groups (since 18 / 2 = 9). So, each group will contain 2 coconuts. Therefore, there will be 9 groups of coconuts.
"Response:  We know that Philip has 32 bunches of bananas in his collection and each bunch contains 187 bananas. So, we can write this as:

Philip has 32 bunches of bananas = 32 × 187 = 5964 bananas
Now, if we arrange these bananas into groups of 140, we get:

5964 bananas / 140 = 42.5 groups of bananas
So, Philip has 42.5 groups of bananas in his collection."
Response:  Since there are 203 chuoi and 63 cam in Philip's collection, we can assume that each group of chuoi has an equal number of members as each group of cam. Therefore, if we divide the total number of chuoi (203) by 7, we get the minimum number of chuoi in each group, which is 29. Similarly, if we divide the total number of cam (63) by 95, we get the minimum number of cam in each group, which is 0.66. So, the answer is 29 or 0.66.
Response:  We know that there are 142 coconuts and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If we arrange the coconuts into groups of 47, then each group of coconuts will have how many coconuts?  Therefore, if we arrange the oranges into groups of 178, each group of oranges will have how many oranges?
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of pineapples in Philip's collection. Since each group contains an unknown number of pineapples, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of pineapples = Total number of pineapples / Number of groups

We are given that the total number of pineapples is 392. So, if we divide it by the number of groups (196), we get:

Number of pineapples per group = 392 / 196 = 2

Therefore, each group of pineapples contains 2 pineapples."
Response:  If there are 180 quails in total and they are divided into groups of size 18, then we can have how many groups?  We know that the number of groups is equal to the total number of quails divided by the size of each group. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Groups = Total Quails / Size of Each Group  In this case, the size of each group is 18, so we can substitute it into the equation as follows: Number of Groups = 180 / 18  Number of Groups = 10 Therefore, if there are 180 quails in total and they are divided into groups of size 18, then there will be 10 groups.
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas and 87 oranges in Philip's collection. If we arrange the bananas into groups of 2, then each group will have how many bananas?  Therefore, if we arrange the oranges into groups of 93, each group will have how many oranges?
Response:  Since there are 384 cherries and 192 pineapples in Philip's collection, we can say that each group of cherries has an average size of 384/n (where n is the number of groups). Similarly, each group of pineapples has an average size of 192/m (where m is the number of groups).  Now, let's find out how many groups of each fruit Philip has. We know that if we divide the total number of cherries by the number of groups, we get the average size of each group as follows:  Number of cherry groups = Total number of cherries / Number of groups = 384 / n  Similarly, for pineapples, we have:  Number of pineapple groups = Total number of pineapples / Number of groups = 192 / m  Now, we want to find out what value of n or m will make each group of cameras have approximately the same size as each group of pineapples. To do this, we set up two equations using the values given in the problem statement:  For cherries: Number of cherry groups = 384 / n  For pineapples: Number of pineapple groups = 192 / m  Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:  Number of pineapple groups = 384 / n  Multiplying both sides by m, we get:  m = 384 / n  Solving for n, we get:  n = 384 / m  Therefore, Philip has approximately 384/m groups of cherries and 384/n groups of pineapples.  Finally, since each group of cherries has an average size of 384/n, and each group of pineapples has an average size of 384/m, we can calculate the approximate size of each group as follows:  Size of cherry group = 384/n  Size of pineapple group = 384/m  Therefore, the approximate sizes of the groups of cherries and pineapples are directly proportional to the number of groups they are divided into.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 38 pieces of bread and each piece has 19 slices, then...

Answer: 38 x 19 = 702
So Brenda's mother made 702 pieces of bread for the guests."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 people 30 pieces of bread each, then she has made a total of:

14 x 30 = 420 pieces of bread
Therefore, Brenda's mother has made 420 pieces of bread in total."
Response:  If Brenda made 22 pieces of bread and had to throw away 17 pieces, then she must have given each person how many pieces of bread?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pieces of bread (22) by the number of people who got some bread (not including those thrown away). So, if 5 people got some bread, then each person got how much bread?  $22 \div 5 = 4.4$ pieces of bread per person.
Response:  If Mrs. Brenda made 18 pieces of bread and each guest received an equal number of pieces, then the number of pieces each guest received is 18 / 9 = 2. So, each guest received 2 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 pies for 2 guests, then each guest received how many pies?  We can start by dividing the total number of pies (14) by the number of guests (2): 14 / 2 = 7 So, each guest received 7 pies.
"Response:  If Mrs. Brenda has prepared 10 pieces of bread for her guests, and each guest receives 2 pieces of bread, then...

Answer: $ $10 \div 2 = 5$ guests will receive bread from Mrs. Brenda."
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to put them equally into two bags, then each bag will contain how many candies?  We can start by dividing the total number of candies (42) by the number of bags (2). So, we have:  Number of candies in each bag = Total number of candies / Number of bags  Number of candies in each bag = 42 / 2 = 21 candies per bag
"Response:  If Frank has 10 pieces of candy and wants to put them in 26 boxes with 33 candies each, then he will have:

Number of boxes = Number of candies / Candies per box = 10 / 33 = 3
So Frank will have 3 x 33 = 99 pieces of candy in total."
"Response:  If Frank has 33 pieces of candy and he wants to put them in bags with 9 pieces each, then...

1. How many bags can Frank make if he has 33 pieces of candy?
Answer: 33 / 9 = 4 bags
2. How many pieces of candy will be left over after filling 4 bags?
Answer: 33 - (4 x 9) = 33 - 36 = -3 pieces of candy

Therefore, Frank will have -3 pieces of candy left over after filling 4 bags."
Response:  If Frank has 11 pieces of candy in each bag and he has 22 pieces of candy altogether, then we can calculate the number of bags as follows: Number of bags = Total amount of candy / Amount of candy per bag = 22 pieces of candy / 11 pieces of candy per bag = 2 bags So, Frank has 2 bags of candy.
"Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of candy and he puts some in each bag, then we can say that each bag contains x number of candies, where x is the total number of candies Frank has divided by the number of bags he wants to put some candy in. So, if Frank has 16 pieces of candy and he wants to put some in 2 bags, then we can write the equation as follows:
x = 16 / 2 = 8
So, each bag contains 8 pieces of candy."
"Response:  If Shirley has sold 25 thùng hoa trefoil and each thùng contains 14 hộp, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hộp hoa trefoil that Shirley has sold.
Total number of hộp = Number of thùng x Number of hộp per thùng
= 25 x 14
= 350 hộp

So, Shirley has sold 350 hộp hoa trefoil in total."
Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 boxes of flowers and each box contains 3 bouquets, then she has sold a total of 3 x 10 = 30 bouquets. Since she needs to deliver 5 bouquets per box, she will need to make 30 / 5 = 6 trips to deliver all the bouquets. Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response:  We know that there are 67 chais of regular soda and 9 chais of diet soda. To find out how many more regular sodas there are than diet sodas, we can subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas:

Total number of sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
= 67 + 9
= 76

So, there are 76 regular sodas more than diet sodas in the store."
Response:  We know that the total number of sodas is 33 (22 + 61). Now we need to find out how many more calories are in the diet sodas compared to regular sodas. According to the question, each can of diet soda contains 0 calories, while each can of regular soda contains 140 calories. So if we divide the number of diet sodas by the number of regular sodas, we get: Number of diet sodas = 61 / 22 = 2.73 times more than regular sodas. Therefore, the customer has 2.73 times more diet soda than regular soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 cans of regular soda and 8 cans of diet soda in total. Since each can of diet soda is equivalent to two cans of regular soda (as stated in the problem), we have:

Total number of cans = 30 + 8 x 2 = 64 cans

Now, let's find out how many bottles of beer are available based on the information provided:

There are 41 apples available. Each apple is equivalent to one bottle of beer (as stated in the problem). Therefore, the total number of bottles of beer available is:

Total number of bottles = 41 / 1 = 41 bottles

So, the answer is 41 bottles of beer."
"Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular water, 53 bottles of reduced-calorie water, and 42 apples in total. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than reduced-calorie soda, we need to subtract the number of reduced-calorie bottles from the total number of bottles:

Total number of bottles = 79 + 53 = 132
Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of reduced-calorie bottles
= 132 - 53
= 80
Therefore, there are 80 more bottles of regular soda than reduced-calorie soda."
Response:  We know that the total number of sodas is 54 + 83 + 12 = 149. Since we want to find out how many regular sodas there are more than diet sodas, let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of sodas: 149 - 83 = 66. Therefore, there are 66 regular sodas more than diet sodas.
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles in total and 9 of them are regular water (not diet). So, the number of diet drinks is 8 (17 - 9 = 8). Since each diet drink contains 30% less calories than regular water, we can calculate the number of calories saved as follows: Number of calories saved = Number of diet drinks x (30% less calories) per drink = 8 x (30/100) = 240 calories saved. Therefore, they have saved 240 calories from their drink choices.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 cans of diet soda and 60 cans of regular soda in total. So, we have:

Total number of cans = 19 + 60 = 79

Now, let's find out how many cans of regular soda there are:

Number of regular soda cans = Total number of cans - Number of diet soda cans
= 79 - 19
= 60

So, there are 60 cans of regular soda. To find out how many more cans of regular soda than diet soda, we subtract the number of diet soda cans from the number of regular soda cans:

More regular soda cans than diet soda cans = Number of regular soda cans - Number of diet soda cans
= 60 - 19
= 41

Therefore, there are 41 more cans of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that there are 72 cans of regular soda and 32 cans of diet soda. Therefore, the total number of cans is 72 + 32 = 104 cans. Now, we have to find out how many more cans than apples. Accordingly, if there are 78 apples, then the difference between the number of cans and apples is 104 - 78 = 26 cans. So, the store has 26 more cans than apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and 54 cans of water. So, we have:
Apples = 36
Cans of water = 54
Now, let's convert both quantities to the same unit (e.g., cups). To do this, we need to divide each quantity by its conversion factor. The conversion factor for apples is 1 apple = 0.27 cups (since there are 36 apples in 1 cup), and the conversion factor for cans of water is 1 can = 0.95 cups (since there are 54 cans in 1 cup). Using these factors, we get:
Apples = 36 x 0.27 = 9.6 cups
Cans of water = 54 x 0.95 = 51.6 cups
So, the store has more cans of water than apples. Specifically, they have 51.6 cups of water more than apples."
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles in total and 28 of them are regular sodas. So, we have 28 x $1 = $28 for the regular sodas. Now, let's calculate how much money is left for the diet sodas. Since there are only 2 diet sodas out of 30 bottles, we can multiply the remaining amount by 2 to get the total value of the diet sodas: $28 x 2 = $56. Therefore, the customer has drunk $28 worth of regular sodas and $56 worth of diet sodas, for a total of $84.
Response:  We know that if we have $x$ regular sodas and $y$ diet sodas, then the total number of sodas is given by $x + y$.  Since there are 4 diet sodas, we can write $y = 4$.  Now, we want to find out how many regular sodas there are.  We know that for every $2$ diet sodas, there is one regular soda. So, we can write $x = \frac{79}{2} = 39$. Therefore, there are $39$ regular sodas in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are 57 cans of regular soda and 26 cans of diet soda. So, in total, there are 83 cans of soda (57 + 26). Now, we need to find out how many bottles of beer are sold. According to the problem statement, ""Họ có bao nhiêu chai rượu?"" which means ""How many bottles of beer do they have?"" Therefore, we can conclude that the number of bottles of beer sold is equal to the number of cans of soda sold minus the number of cans of diet soda sold. In this case, the number of cans of soda sold is 83, and the number of cans of diet soda sold is 26. So, the number of bottles of beer sold is: 83 - 26 = 57 bottles of beer."
Response:  We know that the total number of sodas is 81 (thông thường + ăn kiêng + nhẹ). The number of regular sodas is 60. So, we can subtract the number of regular sodas from the total number of sodas to get the number of non-regular sodas: 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, there are 21 non-regular sodas (i.e., diet or light) in the store.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 cans of regular soda in total. Then, we have 40 cans of diet soda and 6 cans of light soda. Now, let's calculate how many cans each person has drunk based on their preferences:  Person A has drunk all 40 cans of diet soda, so they have not drunk any regular soda. Person B has drunk 25 cans of regular soda (since they drank 25/49 x 40 = 25 cans) and 15 cans of diet soda (since they drank 15/49 x 40 = 15 cans). Therefore, the total number of cans drunk is:  Regular soda: 25 + 15 = 40 Diet soda: 40 So, the answer to the question is 40 cans of regular soda and 40 cans of diet soda.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors to the palace yesterday and today there are 317 visitors, then the difference between the number of visitors today and yesterday is:

$$ \text {Difference} = \text {Today} - \text{Yesterday} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text {Difference} = 317 - 295 = 22 $$

Therefore, there are 22 more visitors to the palace today than there were yesterday."
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 246 of them visited today, then we can calculate the number of visitors in total as follows:  Number of visitors = Total visitors + Visitors from yesterday  So, if there are 246 visitors from yesterday, then the total number of visitors is:  Number of visitors = 703 + 246 = 949  Therefore, there have been 949 people visiting Buckingham Palace over the past 25 days.
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 666 visitors, then the difference between the number of visitors today and yesterday is 666 - 100 = 566 visitors. So, more people visited Buckingham Palace today than yesterday.
Response:  If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day and 406 people visited in total over 327 days, then we can calculate how many people visited on the previous day as follows:  Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days  = 406 / 327 = 1.25 visitors per day  Therefore, on the previous day, approximately 1.25 people visited Buckingham Palace.
Response:  We know that there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and we want to find out how many people visited in total over an 85-day period. So, if there are 829 visitors per day, then the total number of visitors over 85 days is:  Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days  Number of visitors = 829/85  Number of visitors = 10067  Therefore, there were 10,067 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the given time period.
Response:  We know that there are 71 paintings in the Buckingham Palace and Rachel knows that 557 people visited the palace on the day she went. So, we can assume that the number of visitors per day is equal to the total number of visitors divided by the number of days they visited.  Therefore, the number of visitors per day = 557 / 57 = 9.6 (approximately).  Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors over the past 57 days: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days = 9.6 x 57 = 543.2 (approximately).
Response:  We know that there are 39 paintings in the Buckingham Palace and 661 people visited it on the day of the test. If 600 people visited the palace the previous day, then we can calculate how many more people visited the palace on the day of the test as follows:  Number of visitors on the day of the test = Total number of visitors - Number of visitors the previous day  = 661 - 600  = 61 Therefore, there were 61 additional people who visited the Buckingham Palace on the day of the test compared to the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and we also know that there were 419 visitors the day before. Therefore, if we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the total number of visitors on the current day, we can find out how many more people visited the palace on the current day compared to the previous day. So, 419 - 92 = 327. Thus, 327 people had visited Buckingham Palace before the day in question.
Response:  If there were 471 visitors to the palace yesterday and 808 visitors today, then the total number of visitors over the past 89 days would be: 471 + (808 - 471) = 1379. So, in the last 89 days, approximately 1379 people have visited the Buckingham Palace.
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and we also know that there were 191 visitors the day before. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get: 705 + 191 = 896. Similarly, we know that there were 457 visitors the day after, so if we add this number to our total, we get: 896 + 457 = 1353. Therefore, there were 1353 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question compared to 245 visitors the day before.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of hair gel needed is 628 grams and the current amount in his possession is 469 grams. To find out how much more he needs to buy, we can subtract the current amount from the total amount required:

= -211 g

Therefore, the correct answer is (-211) grams."
Response:  We know that the man needs 57 grams of paint to color his beard and mustache. He also needs additional 22 grams of glue to stick them together. Therefore, the total amount of glue needed is 57 + 22 = 79 grams. If the beard requires a total of 353 grams of glue, then the man has how many grams of glue left over?  Answer: 79 - 353 = -264 grams
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of glue to stick his hair and now he has 20 grams less than that amount (166 - 20 = 146), then he needs additional 146 grams of glue to complete the task.
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the mixture is 557 grams and we need to find out how much of it is hair. So, if the weight of one strand of hair is 0.17 grams (as given in the question), then the number of strands of hair in the mixture can be calculated as follows:

Number of strands of hair = Total weight of mixture / Weight of one strand of hair
= 557 g / 0.17 g/strand
= 3296 strands
Therefore, there are approximately 3296 strands of hair in the mixture."
"Response:  If Anh has 11 grams of glue and needs to stick together 492 grams of hair, we can calculate it as follows:

Total amount of glue needed = Total weight of hair x Conversion factor (from grams to grams)
= 492 g x 0.011 g/g
= 5.36 g

Therefore, Anh needs 5.36 more grams of glue."
"Response:  If there are 94 people who have harvested 90 barrels of wine in 6 days, we can calculate the number of barrels each person has harvested per day as follows:

Number of barrels harvested per day = Total number of barrels harvested / Number of days taken to harvest
= 90 / 6
= 15 barrels per day
Therefore, each person has harvested approximately 15 barrels of wine per day."
"Response:  If there are 266 people who have harvested 90 barrels of wine in 5 days, we can calculate the number of barrels each person has harvested per day as follows:

Number of barrels harvested per day = Total number of barrels harvested / Number of people involved in harvesting
= 90 barrels / 266 people
= 34.71 barrels/person/day (round to nearest whole number)
Therefore, approximately 35 barrels of wine were harvested per person per day during the 5-day period."
Response:  If there are 294 people working for him and they harvest 244 baskets of grapes per day, then in one day, they will have collected 294 x 244 = 70,536 baskets of grapes.  Since it takes 146 days to fill all the barrels, the total number of baskets of grapes that will be filled is 70,536 x 146 = 10,18,672 baskets of grapes.
Response:  If there are 235 people working for him and they harvest 100 baskets of rice per day, then in one day, they will have harvested 235 x 100 = 23,500 baskets of rice.  Similarly, if they harvest 221 baskets of rice per day, then in one day, they will have harvested 221 x 235 = 52,695 baskets of rice. Therefore, it will take 77 days to fill 77 x 52,695 = 4,087,775 baskets of rice.
Response:  If 252 people are harvesting 108 baskets of grapes per day, then in one day, they will have collected 252 x 108 = 26,944 baskets of grapes.  To find out how many baskets of grapes will be collected in 58 days, we can multiply the number of days by the number of baskets collected per day: 26,944 x 58 = 1,533,096 baskets of grapes.
Response:  If there are 36 people working for him and they pick 8 barrels of grapes per day, how many days will it take to fill 240 barrels? We can calculate this as follows: Number of days = Total number of barrels / Daily output of workers x 36 workers = 240 barrels / 8 barrels/day x 36 workers = 15 days So, it will take 15 days to fill 240 barrels of grapes if there are 36 workers picking 8 barrels per day.
Response:  We know that there are 26 bể cá for fish in the ocean and each bể cá has the same number of species as the total number of species in all 52 thủy cungs combined. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of species in one bể cá = Total number of species in all 52 thủy cungs / Number of bể cá (26) So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of species in one bể cá = 52 / 26 = 2 Loops! Therefore, there are 2 different species of fish in each bể cá.
Response:  We know that there are 40 creatures in total and each tank has at least 2 creatures. So, we can start with the first tank: Tank 1 has 2 creatures, so it contains 2 + 0 = 2 creatures. Now, let's move to the second tank: Since this tank already has 2 creatures from the previous one, it can only hold 2 more creatures, for a total of 4 creatures in this tank. Therefore, the number of creatures in the second tank is 4. Similarly, we can continue counting the remaining tanks as follows: Tank 3 has 4 creatures, Tank 4 has 6 creatures, Tank 5 has 8 creatures, and Tank 6 has 10 creatures. Thus, the total number of creatures in all six tanks is: 2 (Tank 1) + 4 (Tank 2) + 6 (Tank 3) + 8 (Tank 4) + 10 (Tank 5) + 12 (Tank 6) = 40 creatures. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 baskets of fish for saltwater animals and 10 baskets of fish for freshwater animals. Each basket contains 39 fish in total. So, we can calculate the number of fish Tyler has as follows: Number of fish = Total number of baskets x Number of fish per basket Therefore, the answer is: Number of fish = 56 x 39 + 10 x 39 = 2,474 fish
Response:  We know that Tyler has 74 fish tanks for freshwater animals and 22 fish tanks for saltwater animals. Each tank contains 46 creatures in total. So, we can calculate the number of creatures Tyler has as follows: Number of creatures = Total number of fish tanks x Number of creatures per tank Therefore, the number of creatures Tyler has is: Number of creatures = 74 x 46 + 22 x 46 = 3180 + 952 = 4132 creatures Tyler has 4132 creatures in total, including both freshwater and saltwater animals.
Response:  For the marine animals, he has 15 tanks with 19 fish in each tank, so he has....................... fish in total = 15 x 19 =.......... fish. Similarly for freshwater animals, he has 62 tanks with 19 fish in each tank, so he has....................... fish in total = 62 x 19 =.......... fish. Therefore, the total number of fish is....................... fish.
Response:  If one package contains 13 pieces of white shirts, then buying 39 packages will give you how many pieces of shirts in total?

Response:  We know that there are 26 túis and we have 15 kẹo. So, each túi has 26/15 = 1.73 bánh quy. Now, we have 52 bánh quy in total, so each túi has 52 / 1.73 = 30.49 bánh quy. Therefore, there are 30 túis of bánh quy.
Response:  We know that there are 14 túis and each túi has an equal number of marshmallows. So, if we have 28 marshmallows in total, then each túi must contain 28/14 = 2 marshmallows. Now, let's find out how many túis we have. Since we have 86 candies in total, and each túi contains 2 marshmallows, then we have 86 / (2 marshmallows per túi) = 43 túis. Therefore, we have 43 túis with an equal number of marshmallows inside.
"Response:  If one person has to deliver 5 pieces of junk mail for each house in a row of houses and there are 25 houses in a row, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that one person needs to deliver is:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of junk mail} = \text {Number of houses in a row} \times \text{Number of pieces of junk mail per house} $$

So, if there are 25 houses in a row, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that one person needs to deliver is:

$$ \boxed{\text {Total number of pieces of junk mail}} = \boxed{25} \times \boxed{5} = 125 $$

Therefore, there are 125 houses in a row."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each row and 3 rows of houses, then the total number of houses is 60 (20 x 3). Now, if the person has to deliver 9 pieces of junk mail to each house, the total number of pieces of junk mail he needs to deliver is 540 (60 x 9).
Response:  If there are 6 houses in total and each house has to receive 24 pieces of mail, then we need to divide 24 by 6 to find out how many pieces of mail each house will get. So, the answer is 4 (24 / 6 = 4).
"Response:  If one person sends 14 pieces of junk mail to each house in a row of houses, and they have to send 2 pieces of junk mail for each group of houses (khối), then we can calculate the number of houses as follows:

Number of houses = Total number of pieces of junk mail / Number of pieces of junk mail per house
= 14 x 10 (since there are 10 houses in a row) / 2 (since there are 2 pieces of junk mail per group of houses)
= 70 houses
Therefore, there are 70 houses in a row."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each row and each house needs 32 pieces of waste paper per row, then the total number of pieces of waste paper needed for all rows is:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of waste paper} = \text {Number of rows} \times \text{Number of houses per row} \times \text{Number of pieces of waste paper per house} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of waste paper} = 20 \times 5 \times 32 = 4000 $$

Therefore, the person should bring $4000$ pieces of waste paper to each block."
Response:  We know that there are 30 pieces of junk mail per box and we have to deliver them to each house in a row of 19 houses. So, we need to divide 30 by 19 to find out how many pieces of junk mail we need to deliver to each house. Therefore, the answer is 1.6 (or approximately 1.57) pieces of junk mail per house.
"Response:  If one person has to send 8 letters to each of the 55 neighborhoods, then the total number of letters sent will be:

$$ \text {Total number of letters} = 55 \times 8 = 440 $$

Now, if this person sends 32 letters to each of the $16$ houses in a row (which is not specified whether these are different houses or the same houses), then the total number of letters sent to all $16$ houses will be:

$$ \text{Total number of letters to all $16$ houses} = 32 \times 16 = 512 $$

So, there are $512 - 440 = 72$ houses in a row."
"Response:  If there are 81 neighborhoods and each person has to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each neighborhood, then the total number of pieces of junk mail that need to be delivered is:

81 neighborhoods x 4 pieces per neighborhood = 324 pieces of junk mail
So, the answer is 324."
Response:  If there are 16 rows of houses and each row has 17 houses, then the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 252 houses.  Since the person needs to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, the total number of pieces of junk mail they need to deliver is 252 x 4 = 1008 pieces.
"Response:  We have 10 eggs and 20 pebbles to distribute among 4 groups. Since each group needs at least one egg and one pebble, we can start by giving each group an egg and a pebble. This means that after distributing these initial resources, there will be 9 eggs left over (since each group got 1) and 18 pebbles left over (since each group got 2). Now, let's assume that we want to divide the remaining eggs equally among the remaining groups. If we do this, then each new group will get 3 eggs (since there are now 7 groups in total). Similarly, if we want to divide the remaining pebbles equally among the remaining groups, then each new group will get 6 pebbles (since there are now 7 groups in total). Therefore, the final distribution of eggs and pebbles is as follows: Group 1: 3 eggs, 6 pebbles; Group 2: 3 eggs, 6 pebbles; Group 3: 3 eggs, 6 pebbles; Group 4: 3 eggs, 6 pebbles. In total, there are 10 eggs and 18 pebbles used up, leaving 0 eggs and 0 pebbles unused."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs to share equally among 5 groups. To find out how many marbles or eggs each group will get, we can divide the total number of marbles or eggs by 5.
For example, if we want to distribute 10 marbles equally among 5 groups, each group will get 2 marbles (10 / 5 = 2). Similarly, if we want to distribute 15 eggs equally among 5 groups, each group will get 3 eggs (15 / 5 = 3). Therefore, based on the information given in the question, Rebecca will be able to create 5 different groups with the following numbers of marbles or eggs: Group 1 - 2 marbles Group 2 - 2 marbles Group 3 - 3 eggs Group 4 - 3 eggs Group 5 - 3 eggs So there will be 5 different groups created by Rebecca."
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide 10 eggs into 11 groups of 2 eggs each, then she will have 10 / 11 = 9 eggs left over after dividing them equally among all the groups. So, Rebecca has 9 eggs in total.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 quả trứng and wants to divide them into 4 groups of equal size. Since each group must have at least 2 trứng, we can start by dividing the total number of trứng (8) by 4 to find out how many trứng each group will have:

8 / 4 = 2

So each group will have 2 trứng. Now let's consider the remaining 6 viên đá. Since they are not part of the division process, we can ignore them for now. Therefore, the final answer is: Each group will have 2 trứng."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  If she divides them equally among the three groups, then each group will get 5 eggs (since 15 / 3 = 5).  Therefore, each group will have 5 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 6. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups we can make.  When we divide 18 by 6, we get 3. This means that Rebecca can make 3 groups of 6 eggs each.  Now let's consider the other ingredients. We have 72 chickens and want to distribute them equally among the groups. Since there are 3 groups, we will give 24 chickens to each group (72 / 3 = 24).  Finally, we have 66 pebbles and want to distribute them equally among the groups as well. Since there are 3 groups, we will give 22 pebbles to each group (66 / 3 = 22). Therefore, Rebecca can create 3 groups of 6 eggs, 24 chickens, and 22 pebbles each.
Response:  We have 99 quails eggs and 9 large eggs. So we can make 10 groups of quail eggs (9 x 10 = 90). Now let's add the 27 pebbles to each group. Since there are 10 groups, we will divide 27 by 10 which gives us 2.7 pebbles per group. Therefore, we will get 3 groups of pebbles (2.7 x 10 = 27).  So in total, we will get 3 groups of quail eggs and 3 groups of pebbles.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 pebbles. If we divide the eggs equally among the groups of 5, then each group will have 4 eggs (20 / 5 = 4). Now let's count how many pebbles are in each group. Since there are 6 pebbles total, and each group has 4 eggs, then each group also has 1 pebble (6 / 4 = 1). So Rebecca has more eggs than pebbles. Therefore, the correct answer is: More eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 marbles. To divide them into groups of 20, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources.  Firstly, let's count the number of marbles Rebecca has: 5 marbles. Now, let's calculate the number of groups of 20 Rebecca can make using her marbles: 5 marbles / 4 (since each group needs 4 marbles) = 1.25 groups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, Rebecca can make 1 full group of 20. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles. The correct answer is: More eggs.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in total and needed to score 11 points per round, then he played how many rounds? We can set up the equation as follows: Total points = Number of rounds x Points per round So, we have: Total points = 154 points Number of rounds =? To solve for number of rounds, we can divide the total points by the points per round: Number of rounds = Total points / Points per round = 154 points / 11 points/round = 14 rounds Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds.
"Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds of trivia and scored 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

Luke has scored a total of 177 x 46 = 8,322 points in the game."
Response:  If Luke got 84 points after two rounds of playing the trivia game and he gets the same number of points each round, then we can write an equation as follows:  Points = x (where x is the number of rounds played). Since there are 3 rounds in total, we can substitute x with 3 to get the final answer:  Points = 84 x 3 = 252. Therefore, if Luke gets the same number of points each round, he will have 252 points after three rounds.
Response:  If Luke scores 146 points in each round of a game, then he will score a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in a game of 157 rounds.
Response:  If Luke scored 3 points in each round of the game and he played 10 rounds, then he scored a total of 3 x 10 = 30 points from playing the game. Since he also scored 42 points overall, that means he played more than 10 rounds. Therefore, the number of rounds Luke played is greater than or equal to 11. So, the answer is 11 or more rounds.
Response:  We know that Emily has 2 beads and she can make 32 necklaces. So, each necklace requires 32 / 2 = 16 beads. Therefore, the answer is 16 beads per necklace.
Response:  If Emily is making 11 necklaces and each necklace has 28 beads, then she will have made a total of 11 x 28 = 308 beads. So, Emily has 308 beads in total.
Response:  If Emily has 16 beads and she can make one vòng cổ with 8 beads, then she can make how many vòng cổ?  We know that to find out how many vòng cổ Emily can make, we need to divide the total number of beads (16) by the number of beads in each vòng cổ (8). So, if we divide 16 by 8, we get... 4! That means Emily can make 4 vòng cổ.
Response:  We know that Emily is making necklaces for her friends and she can make 18 necklaces in total. Since each necklace requires 6 beads, we can conclude that Emily needs 18 x 6 = 108 beads to complete all 18 necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 108.
"Response:  If Emily is making necklaces with 5 beads each and she makes 4 necklaces, then the total number of beads Emily uses is:

Number of beads = Number of beads in one necklace x Number of necklaces made
= 5 x 4
= 20

Therefore, Emily has 20 beads in total."
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 beads and she wants to make 72 necklaces for her friends. So, we need to divide 72 by 6 (the number of beads Emily has) to find out how many times Emily can make each necklace.  Therefore, Emily can make 12 necklaces (72 / 6 = 12).
Response:  We know that Emily has 5 beads and she can make 20 necklaces. So, each necklace requires 20/5 = 4 beads. Therefore, each necklace needs 4 beads.
Response:  We know that Emily is making necklaces for 44 friends and each necklace has 2 beads. So, we need to find out how many beads Emily needs in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of friends (44) by the number of beads per necklace (2). Therefore, the total number of beads needed by Emily is: 44 x 2 = 88 beads.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children have spent their summer vacation at the camp than those who stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the number of children who went to camp. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 819058 - 668278 = 150780. Therefore, there are 150780 more children who have spent their summer vacation at the camp than those who stayed at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 202958 children who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children staying at home:

More children stayed at home = Total number of children staying at home - Number of children who went to camp
= 777622 - 202958
= 574664
Therefore, there are 574664 more children who stayed at home than went to camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in Lawrence County. Of these, 629,424 went camping during the summer break. This means that 268,627 (898,051 - 629,424) children stayed at home. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home is 268,627.
"Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in total and 274,865 of them stay at home during summer vacation. So, we have to find out how many children go camping. To do this, we can divide the number of children who don't stay at home (274,865) by the time they spend at camp (in hours). Therefore, the number of children who go camping is equal to:

$$ \frac{274865}{X} $$
where $ X $ represents the time spent at camp in hours. Since we are given that the summer vacation lasts for 3 months, we can assume that each child spends an average of 1 month at camp. Therefore, the time spent at camp per child is:

$$ X = 3months \times 30days/month \times 24hrs/day = 360 days $$
Now, we can plug the value of $ X $ into our equation to get the number of children who go camping:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of children going to camp}} = \frac{274865}{360} = 7609 } $$
Therefore, approximately 7609 children go camping during the summer vacation."
"Response:  We know that 30% of children in Quadrant 1 go to camp (455682/13 = 35906). Therefore, the number of children who stay at home in Quadrant 1 is equal to 100 - 35906 = 9606. Similarly, we can calculate the number of children who stay at home in each of the other three quadrants as follows: Quadrant 2: 455682 / 4 = 113920; Quadrant 3: 455682 / 3 = 151927; and Quadrant 4: 455682 / 4 = 113920. So, there are 9606 + 113920 + 151927 + 113920 = 489005 children who stay at home in all four quadrants combined."
Response:  We know that there are 800059 children who went to camp and we want to find out how many children stayed at home in Lawrence County. So, we can start with the total number of children in Lawrence County which is given as 828521. Now, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home in Lawrence County is: 828521 - 800059 = 487662.
Response:  We know that there are 91676 children in Lawrence County and 61619 of them went to camp. So, the number of children who did not go to camp is: 91676 - 61619 = 30057.
Response:  We know that there are 34044 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 134867 children left at home. Additionally, 424944 children from outside the county attended the camp. Therefore, the total number of children attending the camp is:  Total = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside the county - Number of children left at home = 34044 + 424944 - 134867 = 509855 children.
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 590796 children left at home.  Therefore, the number of children left at home is: 590796 - (610769 x 0.4) = 385574. So, there are 385574 children left at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children from Lawrence County and 893835 other children attending camp. So, in total, there are (644997 + 893835) = 1538832 children attending camp or staying at home during summer vacation. Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home in Lawrence County is 644997.
Response:  If Adam has more than 3 apples and he gave 6 to Jackie, then Adam still has how many apples?  So, Adam has 9 - 6 = 3 apples left. Therefore, Jackie has 3 + 3 = 6 apples.
"Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has:
Adam has 10 - 2 = 8 more apples than Jackie. So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie."
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out who has more apples, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, if we subtract 9 (the number of apples Adam has) from 10 (the number of apples Jackie has), we get:  10 - 9 = 1  Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out who has more apples, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = Who has more apples?  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of apples Jackie has = 10  Number of apples Adam has = 8  Now, let's subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:  Who has more apples? = 10 - 8 = 2  Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples between them. If Adam has x apples, then Jackie has 6 - x apples. Since there are more than 4 apples combined, we can say that x + (6 - x) = 4. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x = 4. Therefore, Adam has 2 apples and Jackie has 4 apples. So, in total, they have 6 apples.
Response:  We know that there are more than 9 apples in total between Adam and Jackie. So, if we add their number of apples together, we get:  Adam has 7 apples + Jackie has x apples = Total number of apples > 9 apples Therefore, the number of apples is greater than 9.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie and together they have 12 apples. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has 12 - x apples. Since we want to find out how many apples Adam has, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Adam + Jackie = 12... (1)

Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, we can write:

Adam = Jackie + 8... (2)

Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1), we get:

Jackie + (Jackie + 8) = 12

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2Jackie + 8 = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation gives us:

2Jackie = 4

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

Jackie = 2

So, Adam has 10 apples (since he has 8 more than Jackie). Therefore, there are 10 apples in total."
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So together they have 4 + 10 = 14 apples. Now we are told that there are 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie combined. Therefore, the total number of apples is 14 + 6 = 20 apples. So Adam has 20 / 2 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie must have less than x apples.  Moreover, we know that Jackie has 89 cherries and 11 apples, so she has a total of 89 + 11 = 100 fruits. Therefore, Adam must have at least 5 - 100 = -95 apples. However, this is impossible since a negative number cannot be represented as an amount of fruit. Thus, the correct answer is 5 apples.
Response:  Yesterday (Tuesday), Helen made 270 bánh sáng. Today is Wednesday, so she has already made another 419 bánh. Therefore, in total, Helen has made 689 bánh yesterday and today.
Response:  We know that Helen has made 90 bánh quy sô cô la yesterday and 51 bánh quy nho khô today, so in total she has made 90 + 51 = 141 bánh quy sô cô la. Additionally, we know that there are 484 bánh quy sô cô la for today, so altogether Helen has made 141 + 484 = 625 bánh quy sô cô la.
Response:  According to the question, Helen has already made 86 bánh quế and 554 bánh sô cô la. So, she has made a total of 639 bánh (86 + 554).
Response:  We know that Helen has made 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 no-bake cookies in total.  If she has also made 85 no-bake cookie bars and 403 no-bake cookie sandwiches today, then we can calculate how many no-bake cookie bars Helen has made as follows:  No-bake cookie bars = Total number of no-bake cookies / Number of no-bake cookie sandwiches  In this case, the total number of no-bake cookies is 144 + 397 = 541. So, if Helen has made 85 no-bake cookie bars, then she must have made 85/541 = 0.16 or approximately 16 no-bake cookie bars. Therefore, the answer to the question is 16.
Response:  We know that Helen has made 19 pieces of steamed cake and 231 pieces of steamed rice dumplings.  To find out how many more steamed cakes Helen has made than steamed rice dumplings, we can subtract the number of steamed rice dumplings from the total number of steamed food items.  Therefore, the answer is:  More steamed cakes (19) than steamed rice dumplings (231).
Response:  Yesterday (hôm qua), Helen made 197 pieces of banana bread and 46 pieces of dried fruit cake. Today (hôm nay), she made 75 pieces of banana bread and 66 pieces of sweet bread. So, the difference between yesterday and today is:  Number of banana bread made yesterday - Number of banana bread made today = 197 - 75 = 122 pieces. Similarly, the difference in number of dried fruit cakes made yesterday and today is:  Number of dried fruit cakes made yesterday - Number of dried fruit cakes made today = 46 - 66 = -20 pieces. Therefore, Helen made more banana bread than dried fruit cakes both yesterday and today.
Response:  Yesterday (day before), Helen made 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 stale peanut butter cookies. Today, she made 280 chocolate chip cookies and 359 stale peanut butter cookies. So, yesterday, Helen made more chocolate chip cookies than today. The difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies made yesterday and today is:  519 - 280 = 239. Therefore, Helen made 239 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday than today.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friend has 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friend, we can subtract the number of games her friend has from the number of games Katie has:

81 - 59 = 22

So, Katie has 22 more games than her friend."
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games together. So, if we add their number of games to Katie's number of games, we get: 91 + 88 = 179. Therefore, Katie's friend has 179 games in total.
"Response: 
Katie has 78 new games and her friend has 48 new games. So together they have:
78 + 48 = 126 new games."
"Response: 
Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19).  Her friend has 8 new games and 69 old games, so her friend has a total of 77 games (8 + 69).  Therefore, Katie and her friend have together 180 games (103 + 77)."
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and 80 old games, for a total of 142 games. Her friend has 73 new games and 41 old games, for a total of 114 games. So together they have 142 + 114 = 256 games.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 57 games and her friend has 63 games. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friend, we need to subtract the number of games her friend has from the number of games Katie has:

Katie has 57 - 63 = -6 games fewer than her friend. Therefore, Katie has 63 - 6 = 57 games more than her friend."
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Now we need to find out how many games her friend has. According to the question, her friend has 34 new games, which means he/she has a total of 34 + 39 = 73 games. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friend - 96 vs 73. So, the correct answer is 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19 at the beginning of the week. Then, Jason earned $24 from washing cars (since he made $33 after washing cars). So, the total amount of money they had at the end of the week is:  $$60 + $19 = $79$$  Therefore, the answer is $79.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 at the beginning of the week and then he spent $10 to wash his car. So now he has $76 ($86 - $10). Then, Jason joined him with $5. Now they have together $81 ($76 + $5). At the end of the week, Fred didn't do any work so he still has $76. But Jason didn't do any work either, so he also doesn't have any money. Therefore, their total amount of money is $76 + $0 = $76."
"Response: 
Fred had $19 at the beginning of the week and spent $5 on snacks during the week. So he has $19 - $5 = $14 left.
Jason had $16 at the beginning of the week and spent $8 on games during the week. So he has $16 - $8 = $8 left.
At the end of the week, Fred earned $40 and Jason earned $69. So Fred's new balance is $14 + $40 = $54, and Jason's new balance is $8 + $69 = $77."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 at the beginning of the week and spent $30 on washing his car. So he has $84 left. Then, we know that Jason had $22 at the beginning of the week and also spent $30 on washing his car. So he has $52 left. Now, let's find out how much money Jason earned during the week. We know that Jason worked for 3 days and earned $10 per day. Therefore, he earned a total of $30 ($10 x 3) during the week. Since Jason spent $30 on washing his car, he now has $62 left ($52 + $10). Finally, we can see that Fred has $84 left after spending $30 on washing his car, so he earns $54 ($84 - $30). Therefore, Jason earned $18 more than Fred during the week ($62 - $44).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 and Jason had $40 at the beginning of the week. Then, after Fred washed his car at the end of the week, he gained an additional $3 ($115 - $112). Similarly, Jason also gained an additional $6 ($40 + $44) during the same period. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from washing cars is:  $3 (Fred) + $6 (Jason) = $9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 and Jason had $3 before they started distributing newspapers. Then, after Fred distributed newspapers for an hour, he earned $112, so his new amount of money is $112 + $49 = $161. Similarly, after Jason distributed newspapers for an hour, he earned $63, so his new amount of money is $3 + $63 = $66. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from distributing newspapers is $161 + $66 = $227.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $78 and Jason had $31 at the beginning of the week. Then, after they shared their money, Jason had $14 left. Finally, when Fred washed his car at the end of the week, he gained $90 more. So, the total amount of money they earned from selling newspapers is: $78 + $31 + ($14 \* 2) = $156.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 + $16 = $49 at the beginning of the week. Then he earned $74 from washing cars and added it to his initial amount, so now he has $49 + $74 = $123. Therefore, Fred earned $123 in the last week.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $47 + $99 = $146 at the beginning of the week. Then he gained $111 from trading and $34 from washing cars, so his new balance is: $146 + $111 + $34 = $281. Therefore, Fred has $281 now.
Response:  Initial weight = 71 kg (given) Time taken to lose 20 kg = x days ( unknown) Now, we know that after x days, Jessie's new weight is 51 kg (given). So, we can set up an equation as follows:  New weight = Old weight - Weight loss per day x Number of days = 51 kg - 20 kg/x days = x days Therefore, the number of days it took Jessie to lose 20 kg is x = 35 days.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. If she lost 101 kg after running for some time, then her initial weight must have been greater than 101 - 27 = 74 kg. Therefore, Jessie initially weighed 74 kg before starting to run every day.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 182 kg (according to the question). After running for some time, she lost weight and now weighs 66 kg. So, her original weight was: 182 - 66 = 116 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running for some time, her weight decreased by 35 kg. So, now she weighs _______________ kg.  Solution:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost 35 kg of weight. Therefore, her current weight is: 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg.
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 kg. After one week of running every day, she lost 50 kg, so her new weight is 114 - 50 = 64 kg. Then, after another week of running every day, she lost an additional 60 kg, so her new weight is 64 - 60 = 44 kg. Therefore, at this point in time, Jessie weighs 44 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is: 9 - 62 = 53 kg. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, bringing her total loss to 203 kg (53 + 140). Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 203 kg.
Response:  After one week of running, Jessie lost 56 kg. So her weight after one week is: 56 kg + 92 kg = 148 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed 148 kg before starting to run.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in total and 61 crocodiles in total. If 64 of them are hiding, then we have to subtract this number from the total number of snakes and crocodiles. So, the remaining number of snakes is:  $95 - 64 = 31$ And the remaining number of crocodiles is: $61 - 64 = -3$ Therefore, there are 31 snakes and -3 crocodiles left after 64 of them hide.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 crocodiles in total. If 40 of them are hiding, then we have to subtract those from the total number of crocodiles. So, the remaining number of crocodiles is : $97 - 40 = 57$ crocodiles are not hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 crabs in the garden initially. If 82 snakes and 19 crabs are hiding, then we have to subtract these numbers from the initial total number of snakes and crabs. So, the remaining number of snakes is: $ 3 - 82 = -79$ Snakes do not hide, so they remain at 3. The remaining number of crabs is: $ 75 - 19 = 56$ Crabs do not hide either, so they also stay at 75. Therefore, there are 56 crabs hidden in the garden.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the enclosure. If 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles are hiding, then we have to subtract their number from the total number of animals. So, the remaining animals = Total number of animals - Number of snakes - Number of crocodiles.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Remaining animals = 79 - 24 - 51 = 34 animals. Therefore, there are 34 animals left inside the enclosure after accounting for the hidden snakes and crocodiles.
Response:  If yesterday he had 171 watermelons and today he has 30 more, then the total number of watermelons he has now is:  171 + 30 = 201 watermelons. So, there are 201 watermelons in his garden after today.
Response:  If yesterday he picked 56 and today he picked 41, then there are 129 remaining (56 + 41 - 2 = 129). So, after harvesting both days, there are 129 left.
Response:  If yesterday he had chosen 154 strawberries and today he has 50 left, then we can calculate how many strawberries he had in total as follows: Total number of strawberries = Yesterday's strawberries + Today's strawberries - Chosen strawberries Total number of strawberries = 154 + 90 - 50 = 194 strawberries So, the farmer has gained 90 strawberries since yesterday.
Response:  If the farmer has taken 172 quails of potatoes and he had initially 77 quails of potatoes, then he has left with 95 quails of potatoes (77 - 172 = 95). Now, let's check how many cauliflowers he has left. According to the question, he has 175 quails of cauliflower initial ly, so he has left with 175 - 172 = 3 quails of cauliflower. Therefore, the farmer has 3 quails of cauliflower and 95 quails of potatoes left in his garden.
Response:  If the farmer has 177 cherries and takes 53 of them, then he has left with 124 cherries (177 - 53 = 124). Now, we need to find out how many potatoes he has left. According to the question, he had 12 potatoes initially, so after taking 53 cherries, he has 7 potatoes left (12 - 53 = -41). Therefore, the farmer has 124 cherries and 7 potatoes left in his garden.
"Response:  The farmer has 105 green peppers and 71 red peppers in his garden. If he takes 137 peppers, then the number of green peppers left is:

105 - 137 = 72

So there are 72 green peppers left in the garden. Similarly, if he takes 137 peppers, then the number of red peppers left is:

71 - 137 = -66

Therefore, there are no red peppers left in the garden."
Response:  If each large piece of wood needs 2 nails to secure it to the wall, then for how many pieces of wood will John need 4 nails in total?  Therefore, John will need 4 x 2 = 8 nails in total.
"Response:  If John needs 13 large pieces of wood for his house and each piece requires 17 nails to attach them, then he will need in total:

$$ Number \ of \ nails = 13 \times 17 = 201 $$

But wait! There is more! The problem states that John also needs 8 additional nails for smaller pieces of wood. So we add that to our total:

$$ Total \ number \ of \ nails = 201 + 8 = 209 $$

Therefore, John will need $209$ nails to build his house."
Response:  We know that there are 11 studs in each wall of Mr. Johnson's house and he needs to use all of them to hold the large wooden planks. If each plank requires 3 screws to be fixed, then we need (11 x 3) = 33 screws for each plank. Since there are 5 planks in total, we need (5 x 33) = 165 screws in total. Now, let's calculate how many planks Mr. Johnson needs to buy based on the number of screws required. Therefore, if he needs 165 screws in total, and each screw costs $0.25, then Mr. Johnson needs to spend ($165 / $0.25) = $660 to buy the necessary screws. So, Mr. Johnson needs 5 large wooden planks to build his house.
Response:  For each large panel (12 pieces), he needs 15 nails to attach them. Since there are 10 small panels, he needs 5 nails for each of those as well. Therefore, in total, John needs 12 x 15 = 180 nails and 10 x 5 = 50 nails, for a total of 230 nails.
Response:  Since each wall requires two pieces of wood and there are 16 walls in total, we can calculate the number of pieces of wood needed as follows: Number of pieces of wood = Total number of walls x Number of pieces per wall Number of pieces per wall = 2 (as stated in the problem) Total number of walls = 16 (as stated in the problem) Therefore, the number of pieces of wood needed is: Number of pieces of wood = 16 x 2 = 32 So, John needs 32 pieces of wood to build his house.
Response:  If each wall of Mr. Johnson's house will use 8 large pieces of wood, and each piece needs 74 nails to secure it, then we can calculate how many nails Mr. Johnson will need as follows: Number of walls = Total number of pieces of wood / Number of pieces per wall = 8 / 1 = 8 walls. Therefore, Mr. Johnson will need 8 x 74 = 592 nails in total to secure all eight walls of his house.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 large boards and 17 small boards needed for the walls of the house.  Secondly, each large board requires 14 nails to attach it to the wall, while each small board requires 25 nails. Finally, we multiply the number of large boards by the number of nails required per board (14) to get the total number of nails needed for all large boards, and then add this amount to the total number of nails needed for all small boards (25 x 17 = 425). Therefore, John needs 439 nails in total to build the walls of the house.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 42 pieces of caramel candies in total. Each piece is divided into 3 parts, so we can write an equation as follows:  
Robin has 42 pieces of caramel candies = 42 / 3 = x gói  
Now, we need to find out how many boxes (gói) Robin has. To do this, we divide the number of pieces of caramel candies by the number of pieces per box:  
x gói = 42 / 3 = 14 gói  
Therefore, Robin has 14 boxes (gói) of caramel candies."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of candy, and each package contains 23 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

43 packages x 23 pieces/package = 1005 pieces
Now, we are told that Robin added 8 more pieces of candy. Therefore, the final number of pieces of candy that Robin has is:

1005 + 8 = 1013 pieces
So, the answer to the question is 1013."
Response:  We know that each box of chocolate has 7 pieces and Robin has additional 6 pieces. So, total number of pieces is:  7 x 5 = 35 pieces. Since there are 41 pieces in total, we can conclude that Robin has 4 boxes of chocolate. Therefore, the answer is:  4 boxes.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 gói kẹo cao su and each gói contains 4 miếng. Therefore, the total number of miếng kẹo cao su is:  28 x 4 = 112 miếng. So, Robin has 112 miếng kẹo cao su.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packets of chocolate and each packet contains 9 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of pieces of chocolate that Robin has is:

$$ Number \ of \ pieces = Total \ number \ of \ packets \ times \ number \ of \ pieces \ in \ each \ packet $$

So, we can write:

$$ Number \ of \ pieces = 21 \times 9 = 189 $$
Therefore, Robin has 189 pieces of chocolate."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 gói kẹo cao su and 14 gói kẹo ngọt. Each gói contains 6 miếng, so we have:
Total number of pieces of kẹo cao su = Number of gói x Number of miếng per gói = 28 x 6 = 168
Total number of pieces of kẹo ngọt = Number of gói x Number of miếng per gói = 14 x 6 = 84
Therefore, Robin has 168 pieces of kẹo cao su and 84 pieces of kẹo ngọt in total."
"Response:  The machine can make 3 shirts per minute, so it has made 6 x 3 = 18 shirts in total. Since it has been operating for some time, let's say t minutes, then we have:

Number of minutes = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per minute
= 18 / 3
= 6 minutes
Therefore, the machine has operated for 6 minutes."
Response:  If the machine can produce 4 shirts in one minute and has been running for 5 minutes, then it has produced 4 x 5 = 20 shirts. So, the machine can make 20 shirts per 5 minutes.
"Response:  The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 today. So, it can make 3 shirts in one minute. Therefore, the number of minutes the machine worked yesterday is:

$$ \text {Number of minutes = Number of shirts produced / Time taken to produce one shirt} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text {Number of minutes = 9 / (1 minute/3 shirts)} $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ \text {Number of minutes = 9 / 1} $$

So, the machine worked for 9 minutes yesterday."
Response:  The machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 today, so in total it has made 16 shirts (13 + 3). If it can make 8 shirts per minute, then the time taken to make all these shirts is: Time = Number of shirts / Rate at which they are made Minutes = 16 / 8 minutes/shirt = 2 hours Therefore, the machine worked for 2 hours.
Response:  The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 today, so in total it has made 9 + 8 = 17 shirts. Since it can make 2 shirts per minute, the time taken to make these shirts is 17 / 2 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 8 minutes today.
Response:  If yesterday, the machine could make 3 shirts in one minute and today it can make 8 shirts in one minute, then we know that the rate of production has increased by 50% (from 3 to 8). So, if the time taken for making one shirt is x minutes, then the time taken for making 3 shirts would be 3x minutes. Similarly, the time taken for making 4 shirts would be 4x minutes. Now, let's find out how much time passed between yesterday and today: Yesterday, the machine made 4 shirts in x minutes = 4(3x) minutes Today, the machine made 8 shirts in x minutes = 8(3x) minutes Therefore, the total time taken for producing all these shirts is: Total Time = 4(3x) + 8(3x) = 12x minutes So, the machine worked for 12x minutes between yesterday and today.
"Response:  If the machine can produce 6 shirts in one minute today and yesterday it worked for 12 minutes, then the total number of shirts produced is:

6 x (minutes today) + 6 x (minutes yesterday) = 6 x 14 + 6 x 12 = 84 + 72 = 156 shirts
Therefore, the machine has made 156 shirts."
Response:  If yesterday it made 5 shirts in 5 minutes, then today it will make 12 shirts in 12 minutes (since it is now faster). So, today it will make 6 x 12 = 72 shirts.
"Response:  If they earned $165 in total over 5 days, and they earned the same amount every day, then we can find their daily earnings as follows:

$165 Total Earning / 5 Days = Daily Earning

Substituting this equation into our problem statement, we get:

Daily Earning = $165 Total Earning / 5 Days

Now, let's solve for ""Daily Earning"" :

Daily Earning = $165 / 5
= $33

Therefore, they earned $33 per day."
Response:  Firstly, we know that they played the game for 22 days and earned $144 per day. Therefore, their total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total earnings = Number of days x Earnings per day Total earnings = 22 x $144 Total earnings = $3,096 Now, let's check if our calculation is correct. According to the question, the total amount of money they earned during the festival was $3,096. So, our answer is correct!
Response:  We know that in total they earned $420 over 30 days and spent $22 per day playing the game. So, if we divide the total amount earned by the number of days played, we get: Total earnings = $420 Days played = 30 Therefore, the daily earnings are: Daily earnings = Total earnings / Days played = $420 / 30 = $14 per day Now, let's find out how much they earned from the game each day: Game earnings = Daily earnings x Number of days played (for the game) = $14 x 22 = $296 So, they earned $296 from the game each day.
Response:  The game earned $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the game is: $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  We know that in total, they earned $120 during the first 20 days and $66 during the remaining 16 days. So, we can calculate their daily earnings as follows:  Daily Earning = Total Earnings / Number of Days  For the first 20 days, the number of days is 20, so:  Daily Earning = $120 / 20 = $6 per day  For the remaining 16 days, the number of days is 16, so:  Daily Earning = $66 / 16 = $4.13 per day  Therefore, they earned $6 per day during the first 20 days and $4.13 per day during the remaining 16 days.
Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of the festival, they earned $325 and in the remaining 57 days, they earned $114 per day. So, to find out how much they earned each day during the remaining period, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left in the festival ($57). Therefore, they earned $2 (in dollars) per day during the remaining period of the festival.
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of chocolate and 4 packs of candy, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages. Since each package contains 5 pieces of chocolate or candy, Lucy bought a total of 14 x 5 = 70 pieces of chocolate or candy. So, Lucy bought more chocolate than candy.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 4 packages of rice crackers (22 pieces per package), and she also bought 16 packets of instant coffee. So, in total, Lucy bought 4 x 22 = 88 pieces of rice crackers and 16 x 500 grams = 800 grams of instant coffee. Therefore, the total weight of the items Lucy bought is 88 + 800 = 888 grams.
"Response: 
1/ Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some other items. So she has 23 + x packages of total goods where x is the number of other items. 
2/ Since there are 27 packages of miscellaneous goods, we can write an equation as follows: 23 + x = 27. 
Solving for x, we get: x = 4. Therefore, Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies plus 4 other items, which means she has 23 + 4 = 27 packages in total."
Response:  Firstly, Lucy bought 2 packs of chocolate which cost $ 3 each, so she spent $ 6 in total for these two packs. Then she bought 12 pieces of chocolate at $ 4 each, so she spent $ 48 for those 12 pieces. Finally, she had $ 56 left after buying all these things, so we can deduce that she spent a total of $ 60 ( $ 6 + $ 48). Therefore, Lucy bought 60 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  At first, there are 12 people on the bus. Then, 4 more people get on the bus, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people on the bus. Since each bus can hold at most 36 people, we know that there cannot be more than 36 / 16 = 2 people left on the bus after everyone gets on. Therefore, there are exactly 2 people left on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people on the bus. Then, 12 more people boarded the bus and 3 got off. So, at this stop, there are 8 + 12 = 20 people on the bus.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 people on the bus. When 9 more people boarded, the total number of people on the bus became 13. So, at this time, there are 9 + 4 = 13 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 8 more people got on board. So, the total number of people on the train now is: 11 + 8 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 people on the train right now.
Response:  We know that there are 22 parents participating in the program and their children make up 676 people in total. So, we can calculate the number of students as follows: Number of students = Total participants / Parents per student (assuming one parent per child) = 676 / 22 = 30.83 students per parent Therefore, there are approximately 31 students per parent who participated in the program.
Response:  We know that there are 73 parents and 724 students participating in the program. Therefore, the total number of people involved is:  Parents + Students = 73 + 724 = 801. So, there are 801 people participating in the program.
"Response:  We know that there are 174 parents participating in the program and 521 students. To find out how many students are attending the program for each parent, we can divide the number of students by the number of parents. So, the ratio of students to parents is:

Number of students / Number of parents = 521 / 174 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 students attending the program for every one parent who is participating."
"Response:  We know that there are 61 parents participating in the program and 177 students. The program can accommodate up to 44 people at a time. Therefore, the maximum number of people who have participated in the program is:

$$ \text {Maximum participants} = \text {Number of parents} + \text{Number of students} - \text{Number of people per group} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Maximum participants} = 61 + 177 - 44 = 182 $$
Therefore, the maximum number of people who have participated in the program is 182."
Response:  If they need to go 1307 feet away from the end of the cave, and the depth of the cave is 919 feet, then we can calculate it as follows: Distance = Depth + Desired distance = 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet So, the end of the cave is 2226 feet away from where they started.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and they have reached 849 feet so far. If they move at a speed of 17 feet per second, we can calculate how much time it will take them to reach the end of the cave as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 849 - 0 = 849 seconds (or 13 minutes and 29 seconds) Therefore, they still need to travel for another 849 seconds (or 13 minutes and 29 seconds) to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  If they were at an elevation of 659 feet and descended to a depth of 762 feet, then their current altitude is:  Altitude = Elevation - Depth = 659 - 762 = -86 feet So, from here, they have to climb up 86 feet to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that there are initially 8 fish in the pond and then 6 more fish are added later. So, the total number of fish in the pond at any given time is 8 + 6 = 14. Therefore, 3 fish have disappeared (biến mất).
Response:  We know that there are 7 goldfish and 12 guppies in the pond. The cats like to eat them. Now we have 15 minutes left. So, let's calculate how many fish will be eaten in this time frame.  Goldfish take about 30 seconds to eat one fish, so 7 x 30 = 210 seconds (or 3.4 minutes) of fish-eating time. Guppies take about 60 seconds to eat one fish, so 12 x 60 = 720 seconds (or 11.5 minutes) of fish-eating time. Therefore, in total, 210 + 720 = 930 seconds (or 15 minutes) of fish will be eaten. So, after 15 minutes, there will be no more fish left in the pond.
Response:  We know that there are initially 16 goldfish and 71 guppies in the pond. The cats like to eat them. Now, Paige has two more people helping her take care of the fish. How many goldfish have disappeared? To find out, we need to subtract the number of goldfish that the cats ate from the initial total. So, if the cats ate 3 goldfish, then 16 - 3 = 13 goldfish remain. Therefore, 13 goldfish have disappeared.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 goldfish in the pond and 5 people have been eaten by the cats. So, we have:

Number of goldfish left = 15 - 5 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond."
Response:  Anh ta started with 43 quả táo and used 2 quả táo after making some bánh. So, he has 41 quả táo left.
Response:  If the chef had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make pies, then we have 23 remaining apples.
Response:  We know that initially, there are 40 apples and 54 oranges in the kitchen. After making some bread, an equal number of apples and oranges remain (39). So, we can conclude that an equal number of apples were used as oranges. Therefore, the number of apples used is also 39.
Response:  Since there are 4 rooms and each room has 4 shelves (or kém), then the total number of shelves is 4 x 4 = 16.  Now, we know that Adam can place 11 animals per shelf, so the total number of animals he can keep is 16 x 11 = 176. Therefore, the maximum number of animal actions that can be stored in Adam's room is 176.
"Response:  Since there are 10 creatures that Adam can place in each cell of his room and he has 8 rooms, then we have:

10 x 8 = 80 creatures
So, Adam's room can hold 80 creatures in total."
Response:  Since there are 4 rooms and each room has 4 compartments, then in total, there are 4 x 4 = 16 compartments.  Each compartment can hold 8 objects, so the total number of objects that can be placed in all 16 compartments is 16 x 8 = 128 objects. Therefore, the answer is 128.
"Response:  We know that there are 544 pots in each garden and each pot contains 32 flowers. So, the total number of flowers in all gardens is:

Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot
= 544 x 32
= 17,608 flowers
Therefore, there are 17,608 flowers in total."
Response:  We know that there are 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. So, in total, we have: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,078 flowers Number of sticks = 466 x 181 = 85,966 sticks Therefore, there are 24,078 flowers and 85,966 sticks in all the pots combined.
"Response:  We have 141 pots and each pot contains 71 bunches of flowers and 91 sticks. So, in total we have:

Number of bunches = Number of pots x Number of bunches per pot
= 141 x 71
= 9631

Therefore, there are 9631 bunches of flowers here."
Response:  We know that each bowl has 40 flowers in it. So if we have 400 flowers altogether, then there must be 10 bowls (400 / 40 = 10). Therefore, there are 10 bowls.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 pieces of Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 pins. If we arrange these pins into groups of 154, then each group will have how many pins?  To find out, let's divide the total number of pins (4276) by 154, which gives us the number of pins in each group: 4276 / 154 = 27.  So, if we arrange the pins into groups of 154, each group will have 27 pins.
"Response:  We know that there are 3941 pieces of Skittles in Steven's collection and 4950 candies in total. If we arrange the candies into groups of 495 each, then the number of groups is:

$$ \frac {3941}{495} = 7 $$

So, there will be $ 7 $ groups of $ 495 $ candies each."
"Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into groups of 8. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these Skittles.

We have 896 Skittles and each group needs at least 8 Skittles. Therefore, we can make at most 112 groups (8 x 112 = 896). Since we cannot make more than 112 groups, the number of groups is 112."
"Response:  Since there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to get the total number of classes:

270 / 5 = 54 classes
Therefore, there are 54 classes in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class  Number of students = 304 x 75  Number of students = 22,500  So, there are approximately 22,500 students in this school.
