Response:  Juliana had 18 children with Peter and Mangal had 10 children with him. So, in total, Juliana had 18 + 10 = 28 children with both Peter and Mangal.
Response:  Juliana had 11 children with Peter and then she had 12 more children with Mangal. So, in total, Juliana had 23 children (11 + 12).
Response:  Juliana had 5 dogs and 20 cats with her when she left for Mangalore. If she took all of them together in the car, then there would be 5 + 20 = 25 animals in total. Now, if she only took 15 of those animals (dogs or cats) with her to Mangalore, then there would be 15 animals less than the original number, i.e., 25 - 15 = 10 animals remaining behind in Mangalore. Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  Juliana had 14 children with Mangal. If she could have kept all of them alive and healthy, then she would have been able to keep 16 children alive if she wanted to. So, she kept 2 more children than what she actually had with Mangal. Therefore, the number of children Juliana kept alive is 16 - 14 = 2.
Response:  If Julie had 16 boys with her in the boat and she gave 12 of them to Mangal, then she would have 4 (16 - 12) boys left with her.
Response:  Juliana had 14 children with Mangal. If she could have taken 8 of them to play with Per, then she would have left 6 children behind. So, the number of children that Juliana took to play with Per is 8.
Response:  Juliana had 17 children with Mangal, and she gave birth to 15 of them. So, there are 15 children in total that Juliana had with Mangal. Now, we need to find out how many babies were born to Badh. According to the passage, Badh had 2 babies. Therefore, the final answer is: 15 + 2 = 17
Response:  Juliana had 15 children with Mangal and 97 children with Buddha. So, in total, she had 112 children (15 + 97).
Response:  Juliana had 5 boys and 9 girls with her in the boat. She gave 3 of them to Peter and 2 to Badh. So, she had 5 + 9 = 14 children with her initially. After giving some to Peter and Badh, she had 14 - 3 = 11 children left.
Response:  Juliana had 2 boys and 14 girls with her at the time of giving birth to the twins. So, in total, she had 16 children (2 boys + 14 girls).
Response:  Juliana had 9 children with Peter and they were all boys. So, there are 9 boys in total. Now, let's count how many of them are older than Mangal. We know that Mangal is 7 years old, so out of the 9 boys, 2 are older than him (Mangal). Therefore, there are 2 older brothers for Mangal among the 9 boys.
Response:  Juliana had 14 children with her husband Peter. Two of them were twins, so that means she gave birth to 12 individual babies. Now, let's assume that each baby was born at an average weight of 3 kg (which is a reasonable assumption). So, the total weight of all the babies Juliana delivered would be: 12 x 3 = 36 kg. Therefore, Juliana delivered 36 kg worth of babies.
Response:  Juliana had 8 children with Peter. Of these, 11 were boys and 9 were girls. So, in total, Juliana had 8 + 11 = 19 children with her husband Peter.
Response:  Juliana had 15 children with Mangal and 7 children with Buddha. So, in total, she had 22 children.
"Response:  Juliana has 13 children with Peter and Mangal, so she has 13 x 2 = 26 children in total. Now, let's calculate how many children each of them have with their respective partners:

* Juliana has 13 children with Peter, so he has 13 / 2 = 6 children with his partner.
* Juliana has 10 children with Mangal, so he has 10 / 2 = 5 children with his partner.

Therefore, the number of children each of them has with their respective partners is:

Juliana: 6 + 5 = 11 children
Peter: 6 children
Mangal: 5 children"
Response:  Juliana had 7 children with Peter and Mangal had 13 children with her. So, in total, they have 20 children together. Now, let's calculate how many children each of them has with their respective partners:  Juliana has 7 children with Peter, so she has 7 - 7 = 0 children with him.  Similarly, Mangal has 13 children with Juliana, so he has 13 - 13 = 0 children with her. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  Juliana had 12 children with her husband Mangal. She then took in 14 more orphans and raised them as her own. In total, she spent 34 years taking care of these children. So, the number of children she raised is: 34 / 12 = 28  Therefore, Juliana raised 28 children.
Response:  Juliana had 19 children with her husband Peter and Mangal had 18 children with his wife Mary. In total, they spent 38 hours together in the boat. Now, let's calculate how many more hours Juliana spent with Mangal than she did with Peter: Total time spent with Mangal = 38 hours Time spent with Peter = 19 x 24 = 468 hours (as each day has 24 hours) Difference between time spent with Mangal and Peter = 38 - 468 = -430 hours So, Juliana spent -430 hours more with Mangal than she did with Peter.
Response:  Juliana had five dogs and Peggy had six dogs. So, in total, they had 11 dogs (5 + 6 = 11). Now, let's compare their number of dogs in pairs. Juliana had five pairs of dogs (5 x 2 = 10), while Peggy had six pairs of dogs (6 x 2 = 12). Therefore, Peggy had more pairs of dogs than Juliana (12 > 10).
Response:  Juliana had 18 children with her husband Peter. She then took 4 of those children and left them with Mangal. After that, she also left 2 more children with him. So, in total, Juliana left 6 children (4 + 2) with Mangal.
Response:  Juliana had 4 children with Badshah and 2 children with Mangal. So, in total, she has 6 + 2 = 8 children. Now, let's see how many children each of them have in their respective families:  Juliana has 4 children with Badshah, so he has 4 children as well. And, Mangal has 17 children, so Juliana has fewer children than him. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Juliana has and the number of children Mangal has is: 8 - 17 = -9.
Response:  Bob has already made 25 muffins and then he added more flour to make another 25 muffins. So, in total, Bob has made 50 muffins (25 + 25).
Response:  Bobi started with 28 tokers and then added more, which is not specified in the question. So, we can assume that he added 42 tokers after starting with 28. Now, the total number of tokers Bobi has is 28 + 42 = 70 tokers. Since the question asks how many more tokers Bobi made, we need to subtract the initial number of tokers (28) from the total number of tokers (70), which gives us 42 more tokers made by Bobi. Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  Bobi made 33 tukris and then made more than 40 chaklits. So, he made at least 73 tukris in total (33 + 40 = 73).
Response:  Bobi made 38 tikka in total and then added more to make 36 more. So, he made a total of 74 tikkas. Now, out of these 74 tikkas, he gave 16 away as gifts. Therefore, Bobi has 58 tikkas left with him (74 - 16 = 58).
Response:  Bobi made 20 balls and then threw 34 more. So, in total, Bobi threw 54 balls (20 + 34).
Response:  Bob has made 21 cakes and then he sold 5 more. So, in total, Bob has made and sold 26 cakes (21 + 5). Now, there are still 4 cakes left with him (as mentioned in the last part of the question). Therefore, the number of cakes left with Bob is 4.
Response:  Bob has made 22 pancakes and given 5 to his friend. Now he has 17 pancakes left. If he gives away another 3 pancakes, then he will have 14 pancakes left. So, the number of pancakes Bob had before giving any away is 14.
Response:  Bob has thrown 19 darts and hit 8 targets. He has scored 40 points so far. So, there are still 22 points left (40 - 8 = 22).
Response:  Bobi has 32 tikas and he gave some of them to his friends. If he had 20 tikas left after giving some to his friends, then he must have given away at least 12 tikas (20 - 8 = 12). So, the number of tikas that Bobi gave away is 12.
Response:  Bob initially had 17 tokers and then gave away 15 more. If he had 36 coins in his possession before giving away any, then after giving away 15 coins, he has 21 coins left with him (36 - 15 = 21).
Response:  Bob has sold 23 tokers and if he had started with 30 kinds of tokens initially, then he must have sold 30 - 23 = 7 kinds of tokens currently.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Elon Musk has 5 billion followers and Jack Dorsey has 3 billion followers. So, if we compare their number of followers, Elon Musk has 2 times more followers than Jack Dorsey (5 billion vs 3 billion).
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Elon Musk has 2 billion followers and Jack Dorsey has 3 billion followers. So, if we compare their number of followers, then Jack Dorsey has more followers than Elon Musk. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) More than 3 billion.
Response:  If Elon and Jack have 3 balls between them initially, then they can exchange 1 ball each in round 1. So after round 1, Elon has 2 balls and Jack has 1 ball. In round 2, if Elon gets another ball from Jack, he will have 3 balls now. Therefore, the number of balls that Jack has left is 2 (initially) - 1 (in round 2) = 1 ball.
Response:  According to the given information, Jack has 6 balls in his park and he wants to give some of them to Ella. If he gives 4 balls to Ella, then he will have 2 balls left in the park (6 - 4 = 2).
"Response:  If 5 balls are thrown into Jack Park and there are 6 more balls than Ella in the park, then the total number of balls in the park is:

Total Number of Balls = Number of Balls Thrown + (Number of Balls More Than Ella)
= 5 + 6
= 11
Therefore, there are 11 balls in Jack Park."
Response:  Initially, Elon had 3 balls and Jack had 5 balls in the park. Then, Elon gave 2 more balls to Jack in the park. So, now Elon has 1 ball less than Jack, i.e., Elon has 4 balls and Jack has 7 balls.
Response:  Initially, Elon had 2 balls and Jack had 4 balls in the park. Then, Elon bought more balls from Jack for $5 each. So, Elon now has x balls in the park. Since Jack still has 4 balls in the park, there are y balls left with him after Elon buys some from him. Now, we know that Elon paid $10 for all these balls (including the ones he already had). Therefore, the total cost of all these balls is $10x + $5y. We also know that Elon spent $5 on each ball he bought from Jack, so the number of balls he bought from Jack is $5y. Finally, since Elon initially had 2 balls and Jack had 4 balls, there were 6 balls (2 + 4) in the park before Elon made any purchases. Thus, the number of balls remaining in the park after Elon makes his purchase is 6 - y.
Response:  Initially, Elon had 2 balls and Jack had 6 balls in the park. Then, Elon bought more balls from Jack for $10 each. So, Elon paid a total of $20 to buy additional 3 balls. Now, let's calculate how many balls Jack has left after selling them to Elon. If Jack sold 3 balls to Elon at $10 each, then he received a total amount of $30 (3 x $10). Therefore, Jack is left with 6 - 3 = 3 balls in the park.
Response:  Elon Musk has given away 5 balloons and Jack has given away 4 balloons in total. Now, Elon Musk has more balloons than Jack. So, the number of balloons that Elon Musk gave away is greater than the number of balloons that Jack gave away. Therefore, the answer is (Elon Musk) - (Jack).
Response:  Firstly, Elon Musk has given away $6 billion to charity and Jack Ma has given away $2 billion in parks. Now, there are 3 more parks that need to be built with $18 million each. So, in total, Elon Musk has contributed $6 billion + ($18 million x 3) = $6.45 billion to build these additional three parks. Therefore, the number of excess green areas gifted by Elon Musk is $6.45 billion - $2 billion = $4.45 billion.
Response:  Elon Musk has 6 balls and Jack has 3 balls in total. Now, they are playing a game where each ball represents $100. If Elon Musk throws 4 more balls into the park, how many balls will Jack have after that?  Therefore, the number of balls Jack has after Elon Musk threw 4 more balls is: 6 (Elon Musk's initial balls) + 4 = 10 balls. So, Jack has 10 balls in total.
Response:  Elon Musk has given away 5 balloons and Jack has given away 6 balloons in total. Now, if we add 3 more balloons to the park, then there will be a total of 9 balloons in the park (5 + 6 + 3).
Response:  Elon Musk has 3 balloons and Jack Ma has 5 balloons. So, in total they have 8 balloons (3 + 5). Now, let's consider the number of gifts each person gave. According to the passage, Elon Musk gave 20 gifts and Jack Ma gave 59 gifts. Therefore, the difference between the number of gifts given by Elon Musk and Jack Ma is 59 - 20 = 39 gifts.
Response:  Elon Musk has 7 balloons and Jack has 6 balloons. In total, they have 13 balloons (7 + 6). Now, let's count how many genies are in each person's possession:  Elon Musk has 5 genies and Jack has 4 genies, so together they have 9 genies (5 + 4). Therefore, there are 9 genies in total.
Response:  If Ellen and Jack have combined $500 in their park account, then they have $500 / 2 = $250 each. So, there are 250 balls in total in Jack's park.
Response:  Initially, Elon had 2 balls in his park and then he bought more from Jack for $10 each. So, Elon has $20 + $10 = $30. Now, if Jack sold 6 balls to Elon at $5 each, then Jack would have earned $6 x 6 = $36. Therefore, after this transaction, Elon has $30 - $36 = -$6.
"Response:  If he spends 6 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese every day, then in one week (7 days), he will spend a total of:

English = 6 x 7 = 42 hours
Chinese = 2 x 7 = 14 hours
So, he spends more time studying English than Chinese. The difference between the two is:
English - Chinese = 42 - 14 = 28 hours
Therefore, he spends 28 hours more studying English than Chinese."
Response:  If an English speaker spends 6 hours studying Urdu every day and 7 hours studying Chinese every day, then in one week (7 days), they will have studied Urdu for 42 hours (6 x 7) and Chinese for 49 hours (7 x 7). So, in terms of time spent studying each language, the person has studied Urdu for more than twice as many hours as they have studied Chinese.
Response:  If an English teacher spends 5 minutes reading Urdu every day and 30 minutes speaking Chinese every day, then in total they spend 85 minutes (5 + 30) on language learning per day. Now, if they spend 4 hours (4 x 60 = 240 minutes) on language learning every week, that means they spend 240 / 85 = 2.8 times more time on language learning than their daily routine allows for. So, in terms of time spent on language learning, the teacher is able to cover twice as much ground as their daily routine would suggest.
"Response:  If an English teacher spends 7 hours per day teaching English and he/she teaches for 30 days in a month, then the total time spent on teaching English is:

7 hours/day x 30 days/month = 210 hours/month

Now, if the teacher also teaches Chinese for 2 hours per day, then the total time spent on teaching Chinese is:

2 hours/day x 30 days/month = 60 hours/month

So, the teacher spends 210 hours/month teaching English and 60 hours/month teaching Chinese, which means that the teacher spends a total of 270 hours/month (210 + 60) on teaching both languages."
Response:  If he watches English movies for 5 hours every day and also watches Chinese movies in the same time frame of 5 hours, then he will have spent a total of 10 hours (5 hours x 2) watching movies overall. So, out of those 10 hours, if he spends 2 extra hours watching Chinese movies, then he will have spent 8 hours (10 hours - 2 hours) watching English movies. Therefore, the answer is 8 hours.
Response:  If he reads English for 6 hours and Chinese for 7 hours every day, then in 5 days, he will have read English for a total of 30 hours (6 x 5 = 30) and Chinese for a total of 49 hours (7 x 5 = 49). So, in terms of time spent reading, he has spent more time reading Chinese than English.
"Response:  If he spends 6 hours reading English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese every day, then in total, he spends:

English = 6 x 24 = 144 hours/week
Chinese = 5 x 24 = 120 hours/week
Total time spent = English + Chinese = 144 + 120 = 264 hours/week
So, if he studies for 2 days (i.e., 2 x 24 = 48 hours), his total time spent studying will be:
Time studied = Total time spent / Number of days = 264 / 2 = 132 hours
Therefore, he spends 132 hours studying English and Chinese per week."
Response:  If he speaks English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours every day, then in total, he will have spoken English for 30 days \* 5 hours/day = 150 hours and Chinese for 28 days \* 4 hours/day = 112 hours. So, if he continues to do this for 6 days, he will have spoken English for 150 + 6 \* 150 = 900 hours and Chinese for 112 + 6 \* 112 = 704 hours. Therefore, he has spent more time speaking Chinese than English.
Response:  If he reads English for 4 hours and Chinese for 6 hours every day, then in total, he will have spent 4 x 30 = 120 hours reading English and 6 x 30 = 180 hours reading Chinese. So, in total, he has spent 120 + 180 = 300 hours reading both languages combined over 86 days.
Response:  If an English teacher spends 6 hours per day teaching Chinese students and 7 hours per day teaching Spanish students, then in total they spend 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day teaching foreign languages. However, if they spend 3 hours per day teaching English to Chinese students and 5 hours per day teaching Spanish to Spanish students, then in total they spend 3 + 5 = 8 hours per day teaching foreign languages. Therefore, the difference between the time spent teaching English and Spanish is 5 hours (8 - 3).
Response:  If an English teacher spends 6 hours per day teaching Chinese students and 3 hours per day teaching Spanish students, then in total they spend 6 + 3 = 9 hours per day teaching foreign languages.  Now, if we compare this to the time spent by the same teacher on English language teaching, which is 58 hours per week, then it can be seen that the teacher spends significantly more time (58 - 9 = 49 hours) on English language teaching than on foreign language teaching. Therefore, the answer is 49 hours.
Response:  If we have to translate 7 hours of English lessons into Chinese and Spanish lessons, then it means that in one day, we will be translating 7/1 = 7 hours of English lessons. Now, if we have to translate these 7 hours of English lessons into Chinese and Spanish lessons simultaneously, then it means that we will be translating 7/2 = 3.5 hours of English lessons into Chinese and 7/4 = 1.75 hours of English lessons into Spanish. Therefore, the difference between the time taken to translate English lessons into Chinese and Spanish is 1.75 - 3.5 = 1.85 hours per day.
Response:  If Reina takes 2 hours to learn English every day, then in total she will take 10 days (2 hours/day x 10 days) to reach level B1. Now, if she spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese, it will take her 20 days (5 hours/day x 10 days) to reach level B1. Therefore, Reina spends more time learning Chinese than English.
Response:  If he can walk for 10 minutes in English and Chinese respectively without any breaks, then he can walk for 20 minutes in total (English + Chinese). Since he walks for 2 hours in English, that means he walked for 40 minutes in English (2 x 20 = 40). So, he walked for 60 minutes in total (20 + 40) including both languages.
Response:  For 7 days, he spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. So in total, he studies for 28 hours (4 x 7) in English and 35 hours (5 x 7) in Chinese. Therefore, he studies for a total of 63 hours (28 + 35).
Response:  On day 1, Percy received $800 from Sean.  On the next day (day 2), Sean gave him an additional $700. So, in total, Percy received $800 + $700 = $1500 from Sean.
Response:  On day 1, Percy had $70 in his pocket. The next day, he got an additional $12. So, now Percy has $82 in his pocket.  Therefore, the number of big bills that Percy received on the second day is: $82 - $70 = $12.
Response:  Per has $400 in his pocket and he wants to buy something that costs at least 5 big bags of rice (which cost $12 each). So, if he spends all of his money, he will have enough for 4 big bags of rice ($48). If he still has some money left after buying those 4 big bags, then he can afford to buy additional big bags of rice up to a total of 6 big bags ($72). Therefore, in the next day, he will have enough money to buy 2 more big bags of rice ($14).
Response:  Per has 4 bags of rice worth Rs. 100 each, and he gives 2 bags to Preet. Now, if there are 8 big bags of rice in total, then how many bags does Per have left?  So, the answer is 6 big bags of rice (8 - 2 = 6).
Response:  Per had $10 at first and then gained $3 every day for 3 days and lost $2 every day for 4 days. So, his balance after 3 days was $10 + $3 = $13. After that, he gained $7 every day for 4 days, so his balance after 7 days was $13 + $7 = $20. Therefore, the total amount of money Per had after 7 days is $20.
Response:  Per had 8 big coins in his pocket one day and lost them all the next day. He got 4 big coins back that same day and then received 3 more big coins after that. How many big coins did he get back in total?  We can use the information given in the question to calculate this.  So, Per got 4 + 3 = 7 big coins back in total.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 big bags of rice with Pervez. The next day, he got additional 7 big bags of rice and 44 small bags of rice. So, in total, how many big bags of rice did Pervez have?  We can calculate this as follows:  Big bags of rice = Total amount of rice / Amount per big bag  In this case, the total amount of rice is 3 + 7 + 44 = 54 big bags of rice. Since each big bag contains 30 kg, we can calculate the total weight of big bags of rice as follows:  Total weight of big bags of rice = Number of big bags x Weight per big bag  Therefore, the total weight of big bags of rice for Pervez is:  Total weight of big bags of rice = 54 x 30 kg/big bag = 1620 kg (or 1.62 tons)
"Response:  We have 17 red balls and 16 green balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many more red balls there are than green balls. So, let's subtract the number of green balls from the number of red balls:

17 - 16 = 1

So, there are one more red ball than green balls."
"Response:  We have 5 red apples and 11 green apples in total. Now, we need to find out how many more green apples there are than red apples. So, let's subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples:

Total number of apples = 5 + 11 = 16
Number of red apples = 5
Number of green apples = 11 - 5 = 6
Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples."
Response:  If there are 15 red and blue balls in total in the urn, then the number of blue balls is 15 - 7 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 blue balls in the urn.
Response:  If there are two red apples and five green apples in the basket, then the total number of apples in the basket is 7 (2 + 5).  Now, if we add 10 more green apples to the basket, the new total number of apples in the basket would be 17 (7 + 10).
Response:  We have 7 red apples and 8 green apples in total. So, the number of apples we have is: 7 + 8 = 15 apples.
Response:  We have 7 red apples and 71 green apples in total. Now, we need to find out how many more green apples there are than red apples. So, we subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 71 - 7 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 more green apples than red apples.
Response:  We have 2 red balls and 6 white balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of different colored balls are there in the bag. Since there are 14 blue balls in the bag, each pair will consist of one red ball and one blue ball. Therefore, the number of pairs is: 2 x 14 = 28 pairs.
Response:  We have to find out how many red balls, white balls and green balls are there in total.  So, we will count them one by one.  Red Balls:  There are 19 red balls in total. White Balls:  There are 11 white balls in total. Green Balls:  There are 12 green balls in total. Now, let's calculate the total number of balls: Total Number of Balls = Red Balls + White Balls + Green Balls = 19 + 11 + 12 = 42 Therefore, there are 42 balls in total.
Response:  We have 90 red balls and 16 blue balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many red and blue balls are there in each container.  Red Balls: Since there are 90 red balls in total, each container will contain $\frac{90}{4} = 22$ red balls. Blue Balls: Since there are 16 blue balls in total, each container will contain $\frac{16}{4} = 4$ blue balls. Therefore, the number of red balls in each container is $22$, and the number of blue balls in each container is $4$.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red balls, 14 white balls, and 17 blue balls in the bag. So, we have:

Red balls: 18 x $ \frac{1}{2}$ = 9
White balls: 14 x $\$ \frac{1}{2}$ = 7
Blue balls: 17 x $\$ \frac{1}{2}$ = 8
So, there are 9 red balls, 7 white balls, and 8 blue balls in the bag."
Response:  We have 5 red apples and 6 green apples in total. So, the number of red apples is 5/10 = 0.5, and the number of green apples is 6/10 = 0.6. Therefore, there are 0.5 red apples and 0.6 green apples in total.
Response:  There are 65 tokers in total, and each toker has either 7 red or 3 green candles. So, there are a total of 65 x 8 = 520 candles (red + green).
Response:  There are 11 tokers in total, and each toker has one mouthpiece. So, there are 11 mouthpieces in total. Each mouthpiece contains 10 red and 18 white beads. Therefore, the total number of beads in all 11 mouthpieces is: 10 x 11 = 110 red beads + 18 x 11 = 204 white beads = 314 beads.
Response:  There are 6 tokers in each of the 3 groups (A, B, and C). Each group has one toker who smokes every year. So, there are 6 x 3 = 18 tokers in total. Among them, 16 are red and 18 are green. Therefore, there are 16 red tokers and 18 green tokers.
Response:  There are 7 tokers in total, and each toker has one red and two green candles. So, there will be 7 x 1 = 7 red candles and 7 x 2 = 14 green candles in total. Therefore, the number of green candles is 14.
Response:  In each of the four tokri, there are 4 red and 3 green tokens. So, in total, there are 4 x 4 = 16 red tokens and 3 x 3 = 9 green tokens. Therefore, there are 16 + 9 = 25 tokens in all five tokris combined.
Response:  In each of the two tokers, there are 4 red and 4 white beads. If we combine all the tokens, then in total, there will be 12 beads. Now, if we divide the number of beads in each token by the number of tokens, we get: Number of beads per token = Total number of beads / Number of tokens = 12 / 2 = 6 beads per token. Therefore, there are 6 white beads and 6 red beads in each of the two tokens.
Response:  In total, there are 16 apples in the basket. If 13 of them are red and some others are green, then how many green apples are there? We can assume that all the remaining apples are green. So, the number of green apples is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of red apples. Therefore, the number of green apples is 16 - 13 = 3.
"Response:  We have 19 red and 4 green tokens in total. If we want to distribute them equally among 15 token holders, each person will get:

Red Tokens: 19 / 15 = 1.267 (approximately) red tokens per person
Green Tokens: 4 / 15 = 0.267 (approximately) green tokens per person
So, there are approximately 1.267 red tokens and 0.267 green tokens for every 15 token holders."
Response:  In each of the 10 tokri, there are either 4 red or 6 green tokens. So, in total, there are 4 x 10 = 40 red tokens and 6 x 10 = 60 green tokens. Therefore, there are 40 + 60 = 100 tokens in all 10 tokris.
Response:  We have 6 green apples, 60 pears, and 2 red oranges in total. Now, we need to find out how many more green apples are there than red oranges. So, let's count the number of green apples and red oranges separately: Green Apples : 6 Red Oranges : 2 Therefore, there are 4 more green apples than red oranges (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  Jerry had 4 cars in his garage and added some more to it later. If he has 8 cars now, then initially he had 4 x = 8 = 32 cars in his garage. So, there are 32 cars in Jerry's garage.
"Response:  Jerry had 5 eggs in his basket and added 7 more eggs to it later. If there are 10 egg fighters in total, then the number of egg fighters in Jerry's basket is:

Number of egg fighters in Jerry's basket = Total number of egg fighters / Number of eggs in Jerry's basket
= 10 egg fighters / (5 + 7)
= 10 egg fighters / 12
= 83%
Therefore, there are approximately 83% of the total number of egg fighters in Jerry's basket."
"Response:  Jerry has counted 4 cars and 22 books in his garage. If he adds 6 more cars to the same garage, then the total number of cars will be:

Total number of cars = 4 + 6 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cars in Jerry's garage after adding 6 more cars."
Response:  Jerry has placed 5 eggs in one shell and 9 books in another shell. Then he added 7 more eggs to that shell. So, the total number of objects (eggs + books) in that shell is 12 (5 + 9 + 7).
Response:  Jerry has placed 2 eggs in each of his 5 baskets, so he has a total of 10 eggs (2 x 5 = 10). Now, if we assume that each egg represents one book, then Jerry has a total of 10 books in his baskets.
Response:  According to the question, Jerry has placed 8 books in his shelf with numbers 1-8 and 9 books without any numbering. So, there are 8 books with numbers on the shelf and 9 books without any numbering. Therefore, the total number of books on the shelf is 8 + 9 = 17 books.
Response:  Jerry has placed 7 books in his own compartment and added 2 more books to it later. So, there are 9 books in total in Jerry's compartment. Now, let's calculate how many exercises each book contains based on the information given in the question: Book 1 - 4 exercises per page x 3 pages = 12 exercises Book 2 - 5 exercises per page x 4 pages = 20 exercises Book 3 - 6 exercises per page x 3 pages = 18 exercises Book 4 - 7 exercises per page x 2 pages = 14 exercises Book 5 - 8 exercises per page x 2 pages = 16 exercises Book 6 - 9 exercises per page x 2 pages = 18 exercises Book 7 - 10 exercises per page x 1 page = 10 exercises Total number of exercises in all 7 books = 12 + 20 + 18 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 10 = 120 exercises Therefore, there are 120 exercises in total in Jerry's compartment.
Response:  Jerry has placed 5 books in his shelf with numbers 1 to 5 and two more books that he wants to add to the shelf. Now, if we assume that each book takes up one slot in the shelf, then the total number of slots available for new books is 7 (5 + 2). So, the maximum number of additional books Jerry can place on the shelf is 7.
Response:  Jerry had 8 eggs in his basket and added more 4 egg fighters to it later. So, initially he had 8 + 4 = 12 eggs in his basket. Then, he gave 5 of them away. Therefore, the number of eggs left in Jerry's basket after giving 5 away is 12 - 5 = 7 eggs.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had 3 eggs in his bowl and added 4 more eggs to it later. So, the total number of eggs in Jerry's bowl is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. If there were 6 egg fights in Jerry's bowl, then each fight would have contained 6 / 7 = 0.86 (approximately) eggs per fight.
Response:  Jerry had 7 eggs in one of his baskets and added 3 more eggs to it. Then he took out 5 eggs from another basket and put them in the same basket as the initial 7 eggs. If there were initially 8 egg fighters in the second basket, then after adding the 5 eggs, there are now 13 eggs in that basket (including the original 7). So, the number of egg fighters in the second basket is 13 / 8 = 1 1/2.
Response:  Jerry had 5 eggs in his basket and added 3 more eggs to it. Then he took out 7 eggs from the basket. If there were initially 10 egg fighters on Jerry's basket, then after adding 3 more eggs, there would be 13 egg fighters (including Jerry) on the basket. So, the number of egg fighters left on the basket after Jerry took out 7 eggs is 6.
Response:  Jerry has 9 eggs in his basket and adds 7 more eggs to it. So, he now has 16 eggs (9 + 7 = 16). If there are 10 books in Jerry's bag, then each book contains how many eggs?  Solution:  To find out how many eggs are in each book, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of books. In this case, we have 16 eggs and 10 books, so: Number of eggs per book = Total number of eggs / Number of books = 16 / 10 = 1.6 eggs per book.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 exercise machines in his room. After that, he added 2 more exercise machines to the shelf. How many exercise machines were there on the shelf after Jerry added them?  There were 6 exercise machines on the shelf after Jerry added them.
Response:  Jerry has 7 books and 3 calculators in his room. After that, he added 2 more calculators to his collection. So, the total number of books in Jerry's collection is 7 + 2 = 9 books. Similarly, the total number of calculators in his collection is 3 + 2 = 5 calculators.
Response:  We have two dogs and six cats. If we put all of them together on the bed, then there will be a total of 8 creatures (2 dogs + 6 cats) sleeping on the bed. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 4 cows and 3 dogs. If we add 4 more cows, then there will be 8 cows in total (including the original 4). Similarly, if we add 3 more dogs, then there will be 6 dogs in total (including the original 3). So, currently, there are 8 + 6 = 14 animals in total. Therefore, if 5 more cows come, there will be 14 + 5 = 19 cows in total.
Response:  We know that there are 46 bachelors and 32 married men in the group of people. Now, we need to find out how many bachelors are present with their wives. To do this, we will subtract the number of married men from the total number of men. So, the number of bachelors present with their wives is: 46 - 32 = 14. Therefore, 14 bachelors are present with their wives.
Response:  We have 3 crows and 2 storks initially. Now, 5 more crows join them. So, in total, we have 8 birds (3 crows + 2 storks + 5 additional crows). Therefore, there are 8 birds bathed in the water.
Response:  We have 3 storks and 4 babies. Two of the storks are carrying babies together, so there are 2 storks left. Now, each of these two storks can carry either 1 or 2 babies, depending on their capacity. Therefore, the total number of babies carried by all the storks is: 3 + (2 x 1) = 7 babies. So, there are 7 babies carried by the storks.
Response:  We have two crows and six pigeons initially. Three more crows join them later. How many storks can carry these birds at once? A stork can carry one bird at a time. So, in total, we need to divide the number of birds (9) by the capacity of each stork (1). Therefore, there are 9 / 1 = 9 storks that can carry all the birds at once.
"Response:  We know that there are four storks and three babies. So, we have:
4 storks × 3 babies = 12
So, there are 12 babies in total."
Response:  We have 3 crows and 4 storks. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of birds are there in total. To do this, we will divide the number of crows by 2, as each crow is in a pair. So, 3 / 2 = 1.5 pairs of crows. Similarly, we will divide the number of storks by 2, as each stork is also in a pair. So, 4 / 2 = 2 pairs of storks. Therefore, there are 1.5 + 2 = 3.5 pairs of birds in total.
"Response:  We know that there are three storks and two babies. So, we have:
3 storks × 1 baby = 3 babies
2 babies × 2 storks = 4 storks
Therefore, there are 7 storks (3 + 4) who bring babies to their parents."
"Response:  We know that there are four storks and three babies in each basket. So, if we have five baskets, then the total number of storks carrying babies will be:
4 storks x 3 babies/basket = 12 babies carried by storks
Now, let's count how many storks are present in the picture:
5 storks (including the one standing at the bottom right corner)
So, the final answer is:
12 babies carried by storks / 5 storks = 2.4 babies per stork"
Response:  We have 4 cows and 8 calves with them. So, in total we have 12 animals (4 cows + 8 calves). Therefore, 12 animals are bathed in the water.
Response:  We know that there are two storks and five babies. So, if each stork delivers one baby, then how many babies will be delivered in total?  Yes, you got it right! There will be ten babies delivered in total (2 storks x 5 babies per stork).
Response:  We know that there are three babies born to each mother stork. So, in total, we have 3 x 3 = 9 baby storks. Now, out of these 9 baby storks, two are males and seven are females. Therefore, the number of male storks is 2, and the number of female storks is 7. Hence, the final answer is 2 + 7 = 9.
Response:  We know that there are five storks and three ducks in total. Now, we need to find out how many more ducks can fit on top of each stork. To do this, we will divide the number of ducks (three) by the number of storks (five). So, the answer is:  Three ducks per stork. Therefore, if there are five storks, then there can be fifteen ducks (5 x 3 = 15) on top of them.
"Response:  We know that there are three storks and two babies in each of the five houses. So, the total number of storks delivering babies is:
3 x 5 = 15
And the total number of babies delivered by these storks is:
2 x 5 = 10
Therefore, there are 15 storks delivering babies to 10 houses."
Response:  We know that there are 3 storks and they can carry 2 babies each. So, in total, we have 6 babies (3 x 2 = 6). Now, let's assume that 4 of these babies are already born and delivered to their parents. That means we have 2 remaining babies left for the storks to deliver. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  The first book has 48 pages, and the second book has 11 pages. To find out how many pages are in total between both books, we need to add their page counts. So, the total number of pages is: 48 + 11 = 59 pages.
Response:  The first book has 37 pages in the first part and 80 pages in the second part. So, the total number of pages in both books is: 37 + 80 = 117 pages. Therefore, there are 117 pages in both books combined.
Response:  The first book has 60 pages, and if there are 93 pages in total, then the remaining pages (93 - 60 = 33) must be in the second book. So, the number of pages in the second book is 33.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 67 pages.  Since each chapter has 36 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in First Chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 67 / 2 = 33.5 pages So, the first chapter contains approximately 33.5 pages.
Response:  First book has 66 pages, second book has 35 pages and third book has 24 pages. So, total number of pages in all three books is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  The first book has 91 pages, and each page is assumed to have equal space for text. Therefore, the total number of words in the first book = Total number of pages x Number of lines per page x Number of words per line. Since there are no specifications about the size or font of the text, we will assume that all books have the same font size and spacing throughout. So, the total number of words in the first book = 91 x (Number of lines per page) x (Number of words per line). Now, let's calculate the number of words in each bab (section): Bab 1 has 23 pages, so the total number of words in Bab 1 = 23 x (Number of lines per page) x (Number of words per line). Similarly, Bab 2 has 25 pages, so the total number of words in Bab 2 = 25 x (Number of lines per page) x (Number of words per line). Finally, since the last bab contains only one section, the total number of words in it = 1 x (Number of lines per page) x (Number of words per line). Putting everything together, we get: Total number of words in Book 1 = 91 + 23 + 25 + 1 = 140 words.
Response:  The first book has 35 pages, and each page is assumed to be of equal size. Therefore, the total number of pages in the first book = 35 x (number of pages per bab). Since there are three babs in the first book, the total number of pages in the first book = 3 x 35 = 105 pages. Now, let's move on to the second book. It has 18 pages, so the total number of pages in the second book = 18 x (number of pages per bab). Since there are two babs in the second book, the total number of pages in the second book = 2 x 18 = 36 pages. Finally, we have the third book with 3 pages, so the total number of pages in the third book = 3 x (number of pages per bab) = 3 x 3 = 9 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages among all three books = 105 + 36 + 9 = 140 pages.
Response:  The first book has 53 pages, the second book has 75 pages, and the third book has 21 pages. So, in total, there are: 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pages.
Response:  If there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages, then we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages
Response:  The first book has 23 pages and contains two chapters. Since the second chapter starts from page 10 of the first chapter, we can conclude that there are 13 pages (from page 1 to page 10) in the first chapter. Therefore, there are 23 - 13 = 10 pages in the first book.
Response:  Book has 81 pages in total and contains two chapters with 68 pages each. So, there are: Total number of pages = Number of pages in first chapter + Number of pages in second chapter = 68 x 2 = 136 pages in the book. Therefore, there are 136 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that 62 campers woke up early in the morning and went for a run. Out of these, 39 campers ran in the afternoon as well. So, the number of campers who ran both in the morning and afternoon is: 62 - 39 = 23 campers. Therefore, 23 campers ran both in the morning and afternoon.
Response:  There are 52 campers who went to sleep at night and woke up in the morning with ringworm. So, there are 52 - 61 = 9 less campers who had ringworm in the afternoon than in the morning. Therefore, 9 campers have ringworm in the afternoon.
Response:  There are 15 campers who went to sleep at 9 PM. Out of these, 4 campers woke up at midnight and 7 campers woke up at 3 AM. Therefore, in total, 11 campers (4 + 7) woke up during the night. Now, if all 32 campers had gone to bed at 10 PM, then 21 campers (32 - 11) would have slept for 7 hours or more. So, there are 21 campers who slept for 7 hours or more.
Response:  If 60 people from Camp A started working at 7 am and it took them 3 hours to complete their work, then they finished their work at 10 am. Now, let's calculate how many people from Camp B started working at 7 am if 70 people from Camp B started working at 10 am and it took them 2 hours to complete their work.  We know that there are 70 people from Camp B who started working at 10 am, so they worked for 2 hours. Therefore, the total time taken by all the people from both camps to complete their work is: (60 x 3) + (70 x 2) = 180 minutes + 140 minutes = 320 minutes.
Response:  In morning shift, there are 36 compounds and in evening shift, there are 49 compounds. So, in total, there are 36 + 49 = 85 compounds. Therefore, all the compounds (85) were involved in farming.
"Response:  We know that there are 44 camps in total and they have to be divided into three groups of 39, 31, and 0 camps respectively. So, we can start with the first group of 39 camps. Since each group has to contain an equal number of camps, we will divide them equally among the three groups. Therefore, the number of camps in each group is:

Group 1 (39 camps): 39 / 3 = 13 camps per group

Now, let's move on to the second group of 31 camps. Again, since each group has to contain an equal number of camps, we will divide them equally among the remaining two groups. Therefore, the number of camps in each group is:

Group 2 (31 camps): 31 / 2 = 15.5 camps per group (since you cannot have a fraction of a camp)

Finally, there are no camps left in Group 3, so none of these camps will be assigned to this group.

Therefore, the final distribution of camps among the three groups is:

Group 1 (39 camps): 13 camps
Group 2 (31 camps): 15.5 camps
Group 3 (0 camps): 0 camps"
"Response:  We know that there are 53 campsites in total and they are divided into four categories - morning (48), afternoon (49), evening (49), and night (49). Now, let's calculate how many campers went for rowing during each time slot: Morning (48) x Rowing in morning = Evening (49) x Campers who went for rowing in evening = Night (49) x Campers who went for rowing at night = Total number of campers who went for rowing = 
Therefore, the answer is 247 campers went for rowing during their stay at the campsite."
Response:  In 33 days of morning (from 6 am to 9 am), there are 34 hours in total. Now, let's calculate how many hours each camper spent in the two areas - Sham and Doopahar. Since 10 campers went to Sham, they spent 10 x 3 = 30 hours in that area. Similarly, since 24 campers went to Doopahar, they spent 24 x 3 = 72 hours in that area. Therefore, the number of campers who spent time in both areas is 30 + 72 = 102 hours.
Response:  We know that 13 compilers started their journey and 59 campers completed their morning walk. So, in total, 72 people (13 + 59) went for a walk or started their journey. Therefore, the answer is 72.
"Response:  We know that 29 campers started their journey early in the morning and 66 campers started their journey at sunrise. So, the total number of campers who started their journey before sunrise is:

29 + 66 = 95

Therefore, out of 105 campers, 95 (or 91%) campers started their journey before sunrise."
Response:  We know that 41 campers went for ringne and 4 campers went for pedal safari. So, the total number of campers who went for both activities is: 41 + 4 = 45 campers. Therefore, out of 26 campers in double tents, 45/26 = 1.73 (approximately) campers went for both activities.
Response:  There are 46 campers in total. In one day, 43 campers went to sleep early and woke up late. So, the number of campers who slept for more than 12 hours is 43. Therefore, the number of campers who did not sleep for more than 12 hours is 46 - 43 = 3.
Response:  If Richel has picked 4 apples from his tree and there are 7 apples in total in the tree, then we can calculate the number of apples left in the tree as follows: Number of apples left in the tree = Total number of apples in the tree - Number of apples picked by Richel Total number of apples in the tree = 7 apples Number of apples picked by Richel = 4 apples Therefore, there are 3 apples left in the tree (i.e., 7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Initially, there were 4 apples in the tree. Richel took out 2 apples and now there are 2 apples left on the tree. So, the number of apples taken away by Richel is 2.
Response:  Rachel picked 5 seeds from the tree and planted them in her garden. Now there are only 4 seeds left in the tree (if we assume that she did not pick any more seeds after planting those 5). So, if we go back to the tree now, we will find 4 seeds remaining out of the original 20 seeds.
Response:  If Richel has 20 seeds and he plants two seeds in each of his 10 trees, then he will have planted a total of 20 x 2 = 40 seeds. Now, if out of these 40 seeds, only 30 germinate (which is a reasonable assumption), then he will have 40 x 30 = 1200 seedlings. So, Richel will have 1200 seedlings in his forest after planting 40 seeds.
Response:  Rachel has picked 6 apples from her tree and now there are 4 apples left in the tree. So, initially, there were 10 apples (6 + 4) in the tree.
Response:  According to the given information, Richel had planted 30 seeds in his tree and now there are 2 seedlings and 27 non-seedlings in the same tree. So, the number of seedlings in the tree is 2.
Response:  Richel took 4 trees and planted them in his garden after cutting down one tree. Now there are 3 trees left in the forest. So, initially, there were 7 trees (4 + 3) in the forest.
Response:  Initially, there were two apples in the tree. The person picked four apples from the tree and left three apples behind. Now, there are five apples on the tree (the original two plus the three that were left). So, there are five apples on the tree now.
Response:  Mr. Rich has 52 trees and he cut down two trees from one tree. So, now there are 50 trees left in that particular tree. Now, Mr. Rich wants to know how many seeds are left in those 50 trees. Therefore, we can conclude that there were originally 104 seeds (52 trees x 2 seeds per tree) in all the trees combined. However, since Mr. Rich cut down two seeds from each of the remaining 50 trees, there are now only 102 seeds left in total (50 trees x 2 seeds per tree - 2 seeds cut).
Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 10 trees and each tree has 4 seeds. So, the total number of seeds = 10 x 4 = 40 seeds. Therefore, there are 40 seeds in total.
Response:  Rachel has 4 trees and each tree bears 3 apples. So, in total, Rachel has 4 x 3 = 12 apples from her trees. Now, she gives away half of them to her friends, which is 12 / 2 = 6 apples. So, after giving away the apples, Rachel has 12 - 6 = 6 apples left with her.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 dogs and each dog had 5 marbles in its bowl. So, total number of marbles = 2 x 5 = 10 marbles. Now, one dog has taken away 4 marbles from another dog's bowl, leaving it with 6 marbles. Therefore, the updated total number of marbles = 10 - 4 + 6 = 10 marbles. Since now there are 3 dogs (including the original two), each dog has 10 / 3 = 3 marbles in its bowl. So, the third dog has 3 marbles in its bowl.
Response:  Edog and Dog have 10 balls each initially. So, in total, they have 20 balls (10 + 10). Now, Edog takes away 4 of Dog's balls, leaving him with 7 balls. Therefore, the final number of balls that Edog has is 20 - 4 = 16.
Response:  We know that Ed has 6 marbles in his pocket initially. Dog takes 7 of them from him. So, now Ed has 6 - 7 = -1 marble left in his pocket. If Ed had 22 marbles initially, then he would have given dog 22 - 7 = 15 marbles. Since dog took 7 marbles from him, there are only 15 - 7 = 8 marbles left with Ed.
Response:  Ed has 5 apples and gives 3 to Doggo. So, Ed now has 5 - 3 = 2 apples left. If Doggo had 27 apples initially, then he now has 27 - 3 = 24 apples left.
Response:  Adi took 24 excess gold coins from Doggo, and then Doggo gave him back 27 of his own gold coins. So, there is a difference of 3 gold coins (27 - 24 = 3). Therefore, Adi had 3 more gold coins than he gave to Doggo.
Response:  Adrian took 29 stones from Doggy's pile and gave him 17 of them back. So, Adrian had 12 more stones than he started with (29 - 17 = 12). Therefore, Adrian had 12 stones in total.
Response:  Ad Dog had 19 marbles in his pocket initially. He gave away 7 of them to his friend. Now he has 8 marbles left with him. So, Ad Dog gave away 7 marbles.
Response:  Edog has 30 marbles in his pocket initially. He gives away 21 marbles to his friend Khil. So, Edog now has 9 marbles left (30 - 21 = 9). Now, if Edog had 91 marbles initially and gave away 21 marbles to Khil, then he would have 70 marbles left (91 - 21 = 70).
Response:  Aditya took 12 balls from Dog's pile and gave 5 of them to his friend. So, now there are 7 balls left with Dog (12 - 5 = 7). If Aditya had taken 17 balls initially, then he would have given 10 of them to his friend (17 - 10 = 7), which means that now there are 4 balls left with Dog (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  According to the given information, there are 408 Taliban who have taken part in the survey and 42 of them have included Beacon in their diet. Now, we need to find out how many of these 408 Taliban have included Alu in their diet. To do this, we will divide the total number of Taliban (408) by the number of Taliban who have included Beacon in their diet (42). So, the ratio of Taliban who have included Alu in their diet is: 408 / 42 = 9.6% Therefore, approximately 9.6% of the 408 Taliban have included Alu in their diet.
Response:  If Soofia had taken 479 Taliban members to the field for training and they all passed their exams with flying colors, then out of those 479, how many would have been able to perform the task of making beekon (a type of bread) in the oven?  Since there are only 489 Taliban members who were trained in baking, so the number of Taliban members who could make beekon in the oven is 489 - 479 = 10.
Response:  According to the given information, Sofia gave explanations to 310 students about the importance of eating vegetables and fruits. Out of these, 185 students included beans in their meals while the remaining 125 did not include them. So, the number of students who included beans in their meals is 185.
Response:  According to the given information, Sohail has provided 288 teachers with lunch boxes containing specific ingredients. Out of these, 264 teachers have included beans in their lunch boxes, while the remaining 24 teachers have not included beans. Therefore, the number of teachers who did not include beans in their lunch boxes is 24.
Response:  If Soofiya had asked all 457 Taliban to include beans in their meals, then out of them, 63 would have included beans in their meals, which is equal to 14% of the total number of Taliban. Therefore, out of 457 Taliban, 14% or 63 Taliban included beans in their meals.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 182 Taliban who have taken part in the discussion about including beans in their meals. Out of these, 166 Taliban have agreed to include beans in their meals, while 16 Taliban have disagreed. Therefore, the number of Taliban who have included beans in their meals is 166.
Response:  Firstly, Sohail has asked for the number of Taliban who have been included in the list of those who have taken part in the distribution of sweets among the poor. According to the information provided, out of 324 Taliban, 374 have been included in the list of those who have distributed sweets among the poor, while 128 have not. Therefore, the number of Taliban who have not taken part in the distribution of sweets is 128.
Response:  According to the given information, Sohail has taken 300 fruits from 257 Talibas and 120 Minios. Therefore, the number of fruits that Sohail took from each group is:  Number of fruits taken from 257 Talibas = 300 / 257 = 1.18 fruits per Taliba Number of fruits taken from 120 Minios = 300 / 120 = 2.5 fruits per Minio Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits taken by Sohail: Total number of fruits taken by Sohail = (1.18 x 257) + (2.5 x 120) = 304.5 fruits In conclusion, Sohail took 304.5 fruits in total from both groups of Talibas and Minios.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 144 Taliban who have taken part in the survey and out of them, 467 have included beans in their diet, which means that 30% (467/144) of the total participants have consumed beans. Similarly, 79 Taliban have included tomatoes in their diet, which means that 56% (79/144) of the remaining participants have not consumed beans but have eaten tomatoes. Therefore, out of the total 144 Taliban, 30% (467/144) have consumed both beans and tomatoes, while 56% (79/144) have only consumed one of these two vegetables.
Response:  According to the given information, Sohail has asked 337 Taliban for their opinion about Beekun's (a specific person) ability to make good decisions. Out of these 337 Taliban, 23 have recommended Beekun for the position of Tutor. Now, we need to find out how many Taliban have recommended Beekun for this position after considering all the recommendations made by the 23 Taliban who initially supported him. Therefore, the total number of Taliban who have recommended Beekun for the position of Tutor is: 23 x 314 = 6910.
Response:  According to Sohail Khan, he has selected 66 candidates out of 450 for the task of preparing menu cards for different events. If 38 of these candidates have included beef in their menus, then how many have not included it? Therefore, the number of candidates who did not include beef in their menus is 27 (450 - 38 = 212).
Response:  If Soofia had asked all 218 Taliban to make a specific contribution towards buying food for the needy, then out of them, 351 would have contributed only in the form of beans, while the remaining 167 would not have contributed anything. Therefore, out of the total number of Taliban (218), 351 made a contribution towards buying food for the needy, and 167 did not contribute anything.
Response:  According to the given information, Sohail has asked 269 Taliban for their opinion on including aloe vera in the menu of the mess. Out of these, 330 Taliban have supported the idea and 76 have opposed it. Now, we need to find out how many Taliban have changed their minds after hearing Sohail's argument. To do this, we will subtract the number of Taliban who initially opposed the inclusion of aloe vera from the total number of Taliban who supported the idea (i.e., 330 - 76 = 254). Therefore, 254 Taliban have changed their minds after hearing Sohail's argument.
Response:  There are 569 girls and 236 boys in this school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, the difference between the number of girls and boys is: 569 - 236 = 333. Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in this school.
Response:  We have 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many pairs of students are there, we need to divide the total number of boys with the total number of girls. So, the number of pairs is: 841 (boys) / 34 (girls) = 25.
Response:  There are 485 teachers in this school and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys in this school is: 485 - 232 = 253 boys.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in the school and out of them, 228 have brothers. So, the number of boys in the school is:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls with brothers  = 697 - 228  = 469 boys.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 49 boys. If we subtract the number of boys (49) from the total number of students (684), we get: 684 - 49 = 635 So, there are 635 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 girls in the school and 587 boys. So, if we want to find out how many male teachers are there in the school, we can use the following formula: Number of male teachers = Total number of students - Number of female students (i.e., 587) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of male teachers = 868 - 587 = 281 Therefore, there are 281 male teachers in the school.
Response:  The school has 700 girls and 300 boys. If we assume that each girl is equal to 2 boys (which is not necessarily true but for simplicity), then: Number of students in the school = 700 x 2 = 1400 Number of boys in the school = 300 So, there are 1400 students in total, including both boys and girls.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school.  In addition to these, 418 more students will join the school. So, the total number of students in the school at this time is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys + Number of new students = 706 + 222 + 418 = 1346
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Additionally, 44 more girls will join the school. So, at this time, the number of girls in the school is: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. And the number of boys in the school remains unchanged at 811. Therefore, the total number of students in the school at this time is: 946 + 811 = 1757 students.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in this school.  If we add more girls to the school, then the total number of girls will be 632 + x, where x is the additional number of girls. Similarly, the total number of boys will be 410 + y, where y is the additional number of boys. Therefore, the ratio of girls to boys in the school after adding more students can be represented as: Girls/Boys = (632 + x) / (410 + y). Since we want to find out how many more girls than boys are in the school, we can set up the equation: Girls - Boys = x - y. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 278 and y = 190. So, there are 278 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in one school. Additionally, 682 more girls and 8 more boys will join the school. So, at this time, the number of girls in the school is: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. And the number of boys in the school is: 761 + 8 = 769 boys.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in one school.  In total, there are 496 more students (boys + girls) including these two groups. So, the number of boys in all schools is: Number of boys = Total students - Girls = 496 - 135 = 361 boys. Therefore, there are 361 boys in all schools.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in this school. Since there are 36 teachers in total, we can assume that each teacher teaches an average of 9 students (36/308). So, the number of students taught by each teacher is 9.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. To find out how many students (boys + girls) are in the school, we add these two numbers together: 315 + 309 = 624. Therefore, there are 624 students in this school.
"Response:  If there are 402 girls in a school where there are 739 students in total, then the number of boys in that school is:

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
= 739 - 402
= 337

Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school."
"Response:  If there are 458 girls in one school and there are 692 students in that school, then the number of boys in that school is:

Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls
= 692 - 458
= 234

Therefore, there are 234 boys in that school."
Response:  We have 362 boys and 257 girls in one school.  To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of students. So, the difference between the number of boys and girls is:  362 - 257 = 95  Therefore, there are 95 more girls than boys in this school.
Response:  Advertisement cost = $18. He spent $16 on advertising. Now, let's find out how many rupees are equal to $16. We know that 1 USD is approximately equal to 150 INR (Indian Rupees). So, $16 x 150 = ₹9,600. Therefore, there are ₹9,600 left in his account after spending ₹16 on advertising.
Response:  Advertisement cost = Rs. 13 dollars x Rupee exchange rate (Rs./$) =? = Rs. 13 x 60 = Rs. 780. Now, Advertisement cost is Rs. 780 - Rs. 3 = Rs. 777. So, Advertisement cost was Rs. 777 initially and now it is Rs. 3 less, which means Advertisement cost decreased to Rs. 774.
Response:  Ador has earned $9 in the first transaction and then he earned more than that in the second transaction. So, his total earnings are more than $9 + x where x is the amount he earned in the second transaction. Since Ador now has $17, we can say that x = $8 (since $17 - $9 = $8). Therefore, Ador earned $8 in the second transaction.
Response:  Advertisement earned $160 and sold each book for $92. So, he earned total revenue of $160 x 92 = $14,880. Now, he has to pay $6 per book, so he paid a total amount of $6 x 92 = $552. Therefore, he had $14,880 - $552 = $14,328 left after selling all 92 books.
Response:  Advertiser paid Rs. 6 per book for each of the two books he bought. Now, he has Rs. 12 in his pocket (Rs. 6 x 2 = Rs. 12). So, the cost price of each book is Rs. 6.
Response:  Advertisement earned $6 for books and $16 for pens. Now, Advertisement has $19 in his possession. So, before he started earning money from advertising, Advertisement had $13 ($19 - $6).
Response:  Adward has written four books and earned $40 for each book. Now he has $12 left after spending $36 on pens. So, Adward spent $36 on pens.
Response:  Advertisement earned $16 for books and $8 for pens. Now, Advertisement has $19 in total. So, he earned $16 + $8 = $24 from both books and pens combined.
Response:  Adward received $17 from his friend and then gave $10 to another friend. Now he has $7 left with him. So, before giving $10 to another friend, Adward had $27 ($17 + $10).
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has 44 cars in his class today and he gave 58 more cars to Deewa. So, the total number of cars that Zeekr and Deewa have together is: 44 + 58 = 102 cars.
"Response:  According to the question, Zakariya scored 51 out of 100 in today's exam and Dean scored 44 out of 100. So, the difference between their scores is:

Zakariya's score - Dean's score = 51 - 44 = 7

Therefore, Zakariya scored 7 more than Dean in today's exam."
Response:  According to the question, Dean has given 44 students extra classes today and he has taken back 9 of them. So, the number of students who have not been given any extra class is: Number of students who haven't been given any extra class = Total number of students - Number of students given extra classes = 44 - 9 = 35 students. Therefore, Zakeri has taken back 35 students.
Response:  According to the question, Dean has given 51 positions in today's class and he has taken back 49 positions from Zakeria. So, the number of positions that Dean has left with him is 2 (51 - 49 = 2).
Response:  According to the question, Zeekri gave 59 papers in class today and received 44 marks. So, he got 19 extra marks. Now, we need to find out how many papers Zeekri submitted more than his actual score. To do this, we will subtract the number of extra marks from the total number of marks given by the teacher. Therefore, the correct answer is: 27 (marks submitted more than actual score).
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has given 44 push-ups and 17 knee crunches today in his morning class. So far, he has done 29 more push-ups than yesterday but only 13 fewer knee crunches. Therefore, the number of knee crunches Zeekr did today is: 29 - 13 = 16 knee crunches.
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has 53 posts and 14 followers today. In the previous class, he gave 17 likes but received only 10 comments. So, in total, Zeekr has given 53 + 17 = 70 likes and received 10 + 14 = 24 comments.
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has 35 posts and 3 corners in today's class, while Dean has 58 excessive posts but gave away 87 corners to Zeekr. So, the number of corners that Zeekr received from Dean is: 87 - 58 = 29 corners.
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has 46 students in his class and he gave 38 of them more than one push-up. So, the number of students who got less than 38 push-ups is (46 - 38) = 10. Now, according to the next part of the question, Zekri gave 62 push-ups to those who did not get enough push-ups earlier, so the total number of push-ups given by Zekri is (62 + 38) = 100.
Response:  Zakariya gave 19 apples to his classmates today. Dean took 39 apples from Zakariya and gave 13 apples back to him. How many apples did Dean take from Zakariya?  Therefore, Dean took 26 apples (39 - 13) from Zakariya.
Response:  According to the question, Zeekr has given 51 pens to Jam in class today. Then, Dean took 22 pens from Zeekr and gave them back to Jam. Finally, Jan took 4 pens from Jam and gave them back to Dean. So, the total number of pens that Jan took from Dean is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response: zakari has given 15 push-ups to Dean today. Dean has given Zakari 39 more push-ups than he gave to zakari. Therefore, Dean has given Zakari 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups in total.
Response:  If Dean has given 30 extra assignments to students today and if he had given 37 extra assignments yesterday, then we can calculate the total number of extra assignments that Dean gave in two days as follows: Total extra assignments = 30 + (37 x 2) = 30 + 74 = 104 extra assignments. Therefore, Dean gave 104 extra assignments to students in two days.
Response:  If Dean has given away 56 sweets in class today and he had 38 left earlier, then we can calculate how many sweets Dean gave away during the day as follows:  Total number of sweets given away = Number of sweets given away today + Number of sweets given away earlier Total number of sweets given away = 56 + 38 = 94 Therefore, Dean gave away 94 sweets during the day.
Response:  According to the question, Deewana had 40 pens and gave 17 away as gifts today in his class. So, he has 40 - 17 = 23 pens left with him now.
Response:  According to the question, Devon has 36 more push-ups than Zack, but he gave away 33 of them to his classmates. So, Devon had 36 - 33 = 3 push-ups left. Now, if Zack did 58 push-ups and then gave away 33 of them, how many push-ups does Zack have left? Well, Zack started with 58 push-ups and gave away 33 of them, so he has 58 - 33 = 25 push-ups left.
Response:  According to the question, Devon has given 27 extra push-ups today but took 7 away from Zakri. So, the total number of push-ups that Devon gave is 27 - 7 = 20. Now, if Zakri had done 5 push-ups and then Devon took 17 away from him, then Zakri did 5 + 17 = 22 push-ups. Therefore, the final answer is 20 (Devon) + 22 (Zakri) = 42 push-ups in total.
Response:  According to the given information, Richel was able to complete five pages of his homework in science and two pages in mathematics. Now, we need to find out how many pages he completed in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of pages he completed in each subject by their respective weights (50% for science and 30% for mathematics). So, the total number of pages Richel completed is:  Science: 5 x 50% = 2.5 pages Mathematics: 2 x 30% = 0.6 pages Total: 2.5 + 0.6 = 3.1 pages Therefore, Richel completed three and a half pages of homework in total.
"Response:  According to the given information, Richel was able to complete two pages of his homework in mathematics and four pages in science. Therefore, if we assume that each page takes him an equal amount of time to complete, then he spent:

Time taken to complete two pages of homework in mathematics = Time taken to complete one page of homework x 2 = 30 minutes x 2 = 60 minutes

Similarly, time taken to complete four pages of homework in science = Time taken to complete one page of homework x 4 = 30 minutes x 4 = 120 minutes

Therefore, in total, Richel spent 60 + 120 = 180 minutes on his homework."
Response:  If Reechal completed 5 pages of his homework and he has to complete 20 pages in total, then he needs to do 15 more pages (20 - 5 = 15). Now, if he did 7 pages per day earlier, then he still needs to do 8 more days worth of work (15 / 7 = 2). So, in total, Reechal needs to do 2 + 7 = 9 pages of homework every day for the remaining days until he completes all 20 pages.
Response:  If Richel had completed 7 pages of his homework and he has to complete 4 more pages, then he will have completed a total of 11 pages (7 + 4). So, in this case, he will have completed 11/2 = 5.5 pages per day on average.
Response:  If Richel completed 8 pages of his homework and he needs to complete 10 more pages, then he has already completed 8/10 = 0.8 or 80% of the total work. So, he still needs to complete 20% (or 2/10) of the remaining work, which is equal to 2 x 8 = 16 pages. Therefore, Richel needs to complete 10 + 16 = 26 pages in total.
Response:  If Richel completed 8 pages of his homework in science and math, then he has completed 8/2 = 4 pages of homework per subject.  Since there are 6 subjects in total, Richel has completed 4 x 6 = 24 pages of homework overall.
Response:  If Richel had completed 10 pages of his homework and he was asked to complete another 5 pages, then he would have completed a total of 15 pages (10 + 5).  However, if he was asked to complete 3 more pages after that, then he would have completed a total of 18 pages (15 + 3).
Response:  According to the question, Ritchel completed 2 pages of his homework and then he did 3 more pages of homework while watching TV. So, in total, Ritchel completed 5 pages of homework (2 + 3). Now, according to the next part of the question, Ritchel also read 10 additional pages of his textbook during his free time. Therefore, in total, Ritchel read 15 pages of his textbook (5 + 10).
Response:  According to the question, Richel's new pages were completed in two days and he had worked for 10 hours daily. Therefore, the total number of working hours = 2 days x 10 hours/day = 20 hours. Now, let's calculate the number of pages Richel could have written during these 20 hours of work: Total number of pages written = Number of pages written per hour x Total number of working hours = (Number of pages written per hour) x (20 hours) =? To find out the number of pages written per hour, we need to know how many pages Richel wrote in one hour. According to the question, Richel wrote 96 pages in his homework and 48 pages in his free time, which means he wrote a total of 144 pages in 2 days. Therefore, the number of pages written per hour = Total number of pages written / Total number of working hours = 144 pages / 20 hours = 7.2 pages/hour So, Richel could have written approximately 7.2 pages per hour during those 20 hours of work.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 11 pages of physics notes and 2 pages of homework for each subject. Therefore, in total, there are 11 x 2 = 22 pages of homework for both subjects combined. Now, let's assume that out of these 22 pages, 3 pages are additional questions related to biology. So, the number of pages of homework for biology is 22 - 3 = 19 pages.
Response:  According to the given information, Reechal has 7 pages of science notes and 11 pages of homework for each subject. Therefore, in total, he has 7 x 4 = 28 pages of science notes and 11 x 4 = 44 pages of homework. Now, as per the question, Riaz wants to make his homework more comprehensive by adding more pages than just 44 pages. So, let's assume that he adds an additional 8 pages to his homework, making it 52 pages in total (44 + 8). As for the life stories, Riaz has 8 pages of life stories to read and complete, which is already included in the 44 pages of homework. Therefore, the total number of pages Riaz needs to work on is 52 pages (homework) + 8 pages (life stories) = 60 pages.
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""ریچل کو نو صفحات ریاضی کا ہوم ورک مکمل کرنا"". This means to complete 11 pages of new math homework for Reechal.

This means to fill in the blanks of 29 additional math worksheets for Reechal's homework. Therefore, the total number of pages that need to be completed is 11 + 29 = 40 pages."
Response:  According to Richel's statement, he completed 8 pages of his homework and read 7 pages. So, in total, he worked on 15 pages (8 + 7). Now, there were additional 3 pages that needed to be filled with information about his interests, hobbies, and goals. Therefore, Richel worked on a total of 18 pages (15 + 3).
Response:  According to the question, Richel had worked for 5 pages and completed their homework in 3 hours. Therefore, the number of pages he could have read and completed his homework on is: 5 / 3 = 1.67 pages per hour. Now, let's assume that there are 8 more pages left to complete his homework, which means he has to work for another 8/1.67 = 4.92 hours. So, in total, Richel would need to spend around 3 + 4.92 = 7.92 hours to complete all 13 pages of his homework.
Response:  According to the given information, Richel was able to complete two pages of his work in one hour and four pages of his work in another hour. Therefore, we can calculate his average rate of work as follows: Average rate of work = Total number of pages completed / Time taken to complete them In this case, Richel completed 2 + 4 = 6 pages of his work in total. Since he took 1 hour to complete 2 pages and 2 hours to complete 4 pages, we can calculate his average time taken per page as follows: Average time taken per page = Total time taken / Number of pages completed In this case, Richel took 1 hour to complete 2 pages, which means he worked at an average rate of 2 pages/hour. Similarly, he took 2 hours to complete 4 pages, which means he worked at an average rate of 4 pages/hour. Now, let's find out how many pages Richel could have completed if he had worked for 8 hours straight: Total number of pages that Richel could have completed in 8 hours = (Number of pages completed x Time taken to complete each page) / Time taken to complete each page x 8 hours In this case, Richel completed 6 pages in total, so if he had worked for 8 hours straight, he could have completed: Total number of pages that Richel could have completed in 8 hours = (6 pages x 2 pages/hour) / (2 pages/hour x 8 hours) = 32 pages So, based on the information provided, it appears that Richel could have completed around 32 pages of his work in 8 hours.
Response:  According to the question, Richel was able to read 4 pages of his textbook in one sitting, and he had to work for 7 hours to complete it. This means that he covered a distance of 4 x 7 = 28 pages per hour. Now, let's assume that each page of his textbook contains 500 words, which is a reasonable estimate given the size of most academic texts. Therefore, Richel covered a total distance of 28 x 500 = 14,000 words per hour while reading his textbook. To calculate the number of pages he would have read if he worked for 19 more hours, we can simply multiply the number of words he covered per hour by the additional time he spent working: 14,000 x 19 = 266,000 words. Since there are usually around 300-400 words per page, this means that Richel would have read approximately 266,000 / 300 = 886-1,117 pages during those additional 19 hours. So, to summarize, Richel read approximately 886-1,117 pages of his textbook during the additional 19 hours he spent working.

Response:  In the morning, Jack can make 6 eggs and in the evening, he can make 8 eggs. So, in total, Jack made 6 + 8 = 14 eggs.
Response:  If Jack wakes up at 6 am and makes 4 eggs in the morning, then he has 4 eggs left for the rest of the day.  If he eats one egg every hour, then he will eat a total of 4 eggs during the day (4 x 4 = 16). So, there are 16 - 4 = 12 eggs left after Jack eats all his eggs throughout the day.
Response:  Jack has 6 eggs in total and he wants to make 3 omelets with each containing 2 eggs. So, he will use 6 / 3 = 2 eggs per omelet. Now, he has 6 - 2 = 4 eggs left after making 3 omelets. He also has 5 eggs from Sham. Therefore, Jack can make at most 4 + 5 = 9 omelets in one day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack made 5 eggs for breakfast and distributed them equally among 8 people in his family. So each person got 1 egg.  Now, let's calculate how many eggs Jack had after distributing them to everyone in his house. If there are 72 people in Sham's house, then he will have 72/8 = 9 eggs left after giving one egg to each of the 8 people in his house. Therefore, Jack has 5 - 9 = -4 eggs left.
Response:  Jack has made 4 eggs for breakfast and distributed them equally among Dopehr (5 eggs) and Sham (8 eggs). So, Jack gave 1 egg to Dopehr and 2 eggs to Sham.
Response:  In Jekyll Island, there are 3 miles of beach in the morning and 4 miles of beach in the evening. Therefore, the total distance of beaches in Jekyll Island is: 3 + 4 = 7 miles. Similarly, in St. Simons Island, there are 8 miles of beach in the morning and 4 miles of beach in the evening. So, the total distance of beaches in St. Simons Island is: 8 + 4 = 12 miles.
Response:  At 10 am, Jack has 10 milk bottles and gives 3 to Dopehr. So, at 10:15 am, Jack has 7 milk bottles left (10 - 3 = 7). Now, Sham comes and takes 17 milk bottles from Jack between 10:15 am and 11:45 am. Therefore, at 11:45 am, Jack has 0 milk bottles left (17 - 7 = 0).
"Response:  We know that Jack woke up at 6 am and went to bed at 10 pm. So, he slept for 8 hours (from 10 pm to 6 am). Now, let's calculate how many miles Jack ran during his sleep time of 8 hours.  According to our calculation in the previous question, Jack ran 32 miles per hour. Therefore, if he slept for 8 hours, he would have run a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 32 miles/hour x 8 hours
= 256 miles

So, Jack ran approximately 256 miles while he was asleep from 10 pm to 6 am."
Response:  If Jack can make 5 eggs in one minute and Charlie can make 8 eggs in one minute, then together they can make 13 eggs in one minute (5 + 8 = 13).
Response:  If Jack can make 4 milk bottles in one day and he makes them in double the amount every day, then after 10 days, he will have made 8 x 4 = 32 milk bottles. So, there are 32 milk bottles in total.
Response:  Jack made 3 emails and 64 morning routines. Then, in one day, he made 5 more emails and 54 morning routines. So, in total, Jack made 8 emails (3 + 5) and 118 morning routines (64 + 54).
Response:  Jack made 5 eggs and 6 cereal bars in the morning. After that, he donated 9 eggs and 7 cereal bars to the depot. So, the number of cereal bars Jack had after giving them away is: 6 - 9 = -3 cereal bars.
Response:  Jack made 7 eggs and 44 lines of work in his morning shift. So, he made $ \frac{7}{2} = 3.5$ times more eggs than lines of work during that time period. Therefore, there were $\boxed{3 + 44 = 47}$ eggs made during the time period.
Response:  At 6 am, Jack had 10 melons and 8 cultivated plots. After that, he gave away 2 melons and 7 cultivated plots to his friend. So, at 8 am, Jack had 8 melons and 5 cultivated plots left with him.
Response:  Jack made 6 miles in one day and then walked for another 2 hours to cover additional distance of 74 lines. So, he covered a total distance of 6 + 2 = 8 miles in one day.
Response:  Jack made 4 eggs in the morning and then boiled them for 2 hours. After that, he added 6 more eggs to the pot and cooked them for another 8 hours. So, in total, Jack has cooked how many eggs?  We can calculate this as follows: Total time taken = 2 + 8 = 10 hours Number of eggs cooked initially = 4 Eggs per hour = 1/60 (as there are 60 minutes in an hour) Total number of eggs cooked = Total time taken x Eggs per hour = 10 x 1/60 = 16 eggs Therefore, Jack has cooked 16 eggs in total.
Response:  If Jack had 9 eggs in one basket and gave 3 of them to his friend, then he has 9 - 3 = 6 eggs left. Now, if he gives 2 more eggs to another friend, he will have 6 - 2 = 4 eggs left. So, Jack has 4 eggs in total.
Response:  In the morning (from sunrise to noon), Jack can make 5 eggs in 20 minutes, and in the evening (from sunset to midnight), he can make 16 eggs in 4 hours. So, in total, Jack can make 5 + 16 = 21 eggs per day.
Response:  If Jack can make 3 milk bottles in 2 minutes and 6 milk bottles in an hour, then he can make 10 milk bottles in 1 day if he works for 24 hours straight without any breaks or rest. So, the number of milk bottles Jack can make in one day is: 10 x 24 = 240 milk bottles.
Response:  Tide rose 9 inches and Mendocino fell 12 inches. So, Tide gained 9 - 12 = -3 inches in height compared to Mendocino.
Response:  Taddy had 31 inches and Mindy had 35 inches. To find out how many challans they got together, we need to add their lengths. So, the total length of the two challans is: 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The distance between Tadi and Minak is 36 inches.  Minak covered 17 inches more than Tadi, so his distance from Tadi is 17 + 36 = 53 inches.  Now, Choha covered 15 inches less than Minak, so his distance from Tadi is 53 - 15 = 38 inches.
Response:  Tedi gave 25 long challans to Minakshi and Choha.  Minakshi got 18 more than Tedi while Choha got 2 less than Tedi. So, the number of long challans given by Minakshi is 25 + 18 = 43. Similarly, the number of long challans given by Choha is 25 - 2 = 23. Therefore, the total number of long challans given by both Minakshi and Choha together is 43 + 23 = 66.
Response:  The distance between Tadi and Minak is 19 inches.  Since Minak is moving towards Tadi at a speed of 10 inches per second, it will take him 19/10 = 1.9 seconds to reach Tadi. Now, since Choha is also moving towards Tadi at a speed of 20 inches per second, he will cover a distance of 19 + (20 x 1.9) = 43.8 inches in reaching Tadi. Therefore, Choha will be 43.8 - 19 = 24.8 inches ahead of Minak when they both reach Tadi.
Response:  The distance between Tadi and Minak is 19 inches, and Minak has gained 39 inches from Tadi. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Minak is 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Now, we need to find out how much Choha has lost in comparison to Minak. Since Choha is behind Minak, he has lost 94 - 58 = 36 inches more than Minak. So, Choha has traveled 36 inches less than Minak.
Response:  Tedi got 25 inches of challanging and Minck got 32 inches more than Tedi. So, Minck got 57 inches (32 + 25). Choha gave 26 inches less than Minck to Tedi, so Tedi got 83 inches (57 - 26).
Response:  The distance between Taddy and Minck is 24 inches. Minck has moved 33 inches away from Taddy, so now the distance between them is 57 inches (33 + 24). Now, Choha has moved towards Minck at a speed of 5 inches per second. How far will Choha move in 10 seconds? To find this out, we need to multiply the distance traveled by the time taken:  Distance = Speed x Time  Distance = 5 inches/second x 10 seconds = 50 inches So, after 10 seconds, Choha will move 50 inches towards Minck.
Response:  The time taken by Tide to fill 13 inches of water is given as 10 seconds. Now, we need to find out how many times Tide can fill 13 inches of water in one minute. To do this, we divide the time taken by Tide to fill 13 inches (10 seconds) by 60 (the number of seconds in one minute). So, Tide can fill 13 inches of water 166.67 times in one minute (10 sec / 60 = 166.67).
Response:  The distance traveled by Taddy is 35 inches and Minck has traveled 4 times that distance which means he has traveled 140 inches (4 x 35 = 140). So, the total distance traveled by both of them together is 140 + 35 = 175 inches.
Response:  Tedi had a speed of 19 km/h and Mindy had a speed of 4 km/h more than Tedi. Choha had a speed of 44 km/h less than Mindy. So, if Tedi traveled for x hours at his original speed, then Mindy traveled for (x + 4) hours at her increased speed, and Choha traveled for (x - 44) hours at his decreased speed. Therefore, the total distance traveled by all three is equal to: Distance = Total distance = x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 3x + 48 Distance = 3(19) + 48 = 57 km.
Response:  The height of Tide is 39 inches and that of Minute Maid is 19 inches more than Tide. Therefore, the height of Minute Maid is 58 inches (39 + 19 = 58). Now, we need to find out how much less is the height of Chhota Bheem from Minute Maid. As per the question, Chhota Bheem's height is 36 inches less than Minute Maid. So, the height of Chhota Bheem is 20 inches (58 - 36 = 20).
Response:  Tedi had a speed of 21 km/h, Minck had a speed of 25 km/h, and Choha had a speed of 16 km/h. To find out how many meters Choha traveled in one direction, we need to multiply his speed by the distance he traveled. So, Choha traveled 16 km/h x 21 m = 342 meters in one direction.
Response:  Minakshi scored 39 out of 50 questions and Tariq scored 17 out of 25 questions. To find the difference between their scores, we need to subtract Tariq's score from Minakshi's score. So, the difference in scores is: 39 - 17 = 22. Therefore, Tariq scored 22 fewer questions than Minakshi.
Response:  The given information is as follows:  Tedi had 9 inches of challang, Minak had 3 inches less than Choha, and Choha gave 33 inches to Maous. So, we need to find out how much challang Maous got from Choha. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total length = (Tedi's length + Minak's length) - Choha's length Now, let's plug in the values we know: Total length = (9 + x) - 33 Where x is the length Choha gave to Maous We are asked to find out how many doors Choha gave to Maous, so we need to divide the total length by 33: Number of doors = Total length / 33 = (9 + x) / 33 Now, simplify the equation: Number of doors = 9 + x / 33 = 9 + (x / 33) = 9 + x / 10 = 9 + x Therefore, Choha gave 10 doors to Maous.
Response:  The distance between Taddy and Choha is 14 inches. Minak traveled at a speed of 37 inches per second. So, in how many seconds will Choha reach Taddy? = (Distance / Speed) x Seconds = (14 / 37) x 20 = 58 seconds. Therefore, Choha will take approximately 58 seconds to reach Taddy from Jhariya.
Response:  The given recipe has 14 eggs and 6 chicken pieces. Out of these, 5 egg whites were used to make the first 5 capsules. Now, we need to decide how many more capsules can be made using the remaining ingredients. To do this, we will divide the total number of chicken pieces (6) by the number of capsules that can be made with each piece (3). So, we can make 6 / 3 = 2 additional capsules using the remaining chicken pieces. Therefore, in total, we can make 5 + 2 = 7 capsules using all the available ingredients.
"Response:  The new coin has been introduced with four different designs, and each design represents one of the four seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. So, there are 4 coins in total. Now, we need to find out how many copies of each seasonal coin have been made. To do this, we will count the number of times each design appears in the given list of 10 coins. Here is the list again for reference:

Coin Design Season (Name) Number of Coins
Spring Floral Pattern Spring 3
Summer Leafy Pattern Summer 2
Autumn Colorful Pattern Autumn 2
Winter Snowflake Pattern Winter 1

As you can see, each seasonal coin has been produced in multiple copies. For example, the ""Spring"" coin has been produced thrice, while the ""Summer"" coin has only been produced twice. Therefore, the answer to your question is:

Number of copies of each seasonal coin = 3 (for Spring), 2 (for Summer), 2 (for Autumn), and 1 (for Winter)."
"Response:  We have 6 apples and 13 oranges in one batch. If we want to make 8 cups of apple juice and 4 cups of orange juice, then we will need:

Apple Juice: 6 x 0.25 = 1.5 cups (since each apple makes 0.25 cups of juice)
Orange Juice: 13 x 0.33 = 4.3 cups (since each orange makes 0.33 cups of juice)

So, in total, we will need 1.5 + 4.3 = 5.8 cups of fruit for both juices combined. Since we already have 6 apples, we only need to add 5 more apples to get 5.8 cups of apple juice. Therefore, we need 5 more apples to complete this task."
"Response:  The given recipe has 11 egg whites and 7 chicken pieces. If he had to divide them equally among 4 cups of atta (wheat flour), then each cup would have:

* Egg whites: 11/4 = 2.75 eggs per cup
* Chicken pieces: 7/4 = 1.75 chicken pieces per cup

So, if he had divided the ingredients equally among 4 cups of atta, then there would be:

* Total number of egg whites: 2.75 x 4 = 11 egg whites in total
* Total number of chicken pieces: 1.75 x 4 = 7 chicken pieces in total

Therefore, out of the 11 egg whites and 7 chicken pieces, he had 11 egg whites and 7 chicken pieces left after dividing them into 4 cups of atta."
Response:  The given recipe has 3 cups of flour in total, and it is asking for 4 cups of all-purpose flour. So, we need to add another cup of flour to make 6 cups in total. Therefore, the answer is 5 (6 - 3 = 5).
Response:  The person has 12 eggs and wants to make 5 chicken omelets. So, they have already made 7 omelets (using 4 eggs each). If they still want to make more omelets, then they will need additional eggs. Therefore, the number of omelets they can make is: 7 + (5 - 4) = 7 + 1 = 8 omelets.
Response:  Mirri has 9 cups of atta and 5 cups of chini. She gave 3 cups of atta to her friend and has 62 cups of chini left. To find out how many more cups of atta she needs, we need to subtract the number of cups she already gave from the total number of cups she had initially. So, the answer is:  Number of additional cups of atta needed = Total initial cups of atta - Cups given to friend = 9 - 3 = 6 cups.
Response:  The recipe has 5 eggs and 14 chicken pieces in it. If we had already taken out 10 egg whites and 2 chicken pieces earlier, then there are only 5 eggs and 12 chicken pieces left in the recipe. To make more chicken pieces, we need to add more chicken breasts to the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 12 chicken pieces.
Response:  We have 12 eggs and we want to make 5 omelets with each containing 3 egg pieces (since there are 3 egg pieces in each omelet). So, total number of egg pieces required = 12 x 5 = 60 egg pieces. Now, we have 49 chips left after making 11 omelets with 3 egg pieces in each omelet. Therefore, total number of chip packets remaining = 49 / 3 = 16 chip packets.
Response:  The recipe has 10 eggs, 2 chicken breasts, and 80 grams of salt. Initially, 7 eggs were used to make 7 omelets. Now, we need to calculate how many omelets can be made with the remaining ingredients. To do this, we will divide the total amount of each ingredient by the number of omelets made initially. So, for eggs, we have 3 eggs left (10 - 7 = 3), which means that 3 omelets can be made using these eggs. For chicken breast, we have 2 pieces left (2 / 7 = 0.286 or approximately 1/4), which means that approximately 1/4 of a chicken breast can be used to make one more omelet. Finally, for salt, we have 56 grams left (80 - 7 = 56), which is sufficient to season at least 56 omelets. Therefore, in total, we can make 3 + 1/4 + 56 = 60 omelets using all the remaining ingredients.
Response:  We have 12 eggs, and we used 3 for making omelette. So, we are left with 9 eggs. Then, we added 14 chicken pieces to make fried rice. Since each piece of chicken contains 7 caps (of meat), we need 9 x 7 = 63 caps of meat from the remaining 9 eggs. However, since we already used 2 caps of egg whites in making the omelette, we now have only 61 caps of meat available from the remaining 9 eggs. Therefore, there are 61/7 = 8.71 eggs worth of meat available to make fried rice.
Response:  We have 6 apples, 8 oranges, and 7 lemons in total. Initially, we had 5 apples, so we added 1 apple to make it 6. Now, we need to distribute these fruits among 4 people equally. So, each person will get 1 apple + (6/4) = 3 oranges + (7/4) = 2 lemons. Therefore, each person will receive 1 apple, 3 oranges, and 2 lemons.
"Response:  The given recipe has 12 eggs and 13 chicken pieces. If we divide these ingredients equally among ourselves (assuming there are 4 people), then each person will get:

* Eggs: 12 / 4 = 3 eggs per person
* Chicken pieces: 13 / 4 = 3.25 chicken pieces per person (since you can't have fractional chicken pieces)

So, in total, each person will receive 3 eggs and 3.25 chicken pieces."
Response:  The first cookie was made in December and had 4 chocolate chips. Now, we have to calculate how many cookies are left after consuming 3 more chocolate chip cookies.  We know that each cookie has 4 chocolate chips, so if we consume 3 more cookies, it means we will have consumed a total of 12 chocolate chips (3 x 4 = 12).  Therefore, there are now 4 - 12 = -8 chocolate chips remaining in the original batch of 40 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  We have 6 chicken and 9 eggs in total. Out of these, we gave away 2 eggs from the first batch. Now, we need to distribute the remaining 7 chickens (6 + 1) among the remaining 9 eggs (9 - 2). So, each egg will get 0.77 chickens (7/9). Therefore, there are 0.77 chickens per egg.
"Response:  The given recipe has 5 chicken pieces and 14 potato pieces, which are cooked together in 11 cups of water. To calculate the number of chicken pieces that can be added to this recipe, we need to divide the total quantity of chicken (5 pieces) by the amount of water used per piece (1 cup). So, the number of chicken pieces that can be added is:

5/1 = 5

Therefore, you can add up to 5 more chicken pieces to the existing recipe."
Response:  The first cap has 3 copies and the second cap has 5 extra caps. So, in total, there are 3 + 5 = 8 caps in both caps combined. Now, if we take away 2 caps from the second cap, then the number of caps left will be 8 - 2 = 6 caps. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
Response:  The recipe has 5 chicken pieces and 13 potato pieces, so it can be divided into 12 portions of equal size. To find out how many chicken pieces are in each portion, we need to divide the total number of chicken pieces (5) by 12. So, there will be 0.42 chicken pieces (5/12) in each portion.
Response:  The recipe has 6 chicken pieces and 14 potato pieces, so in total there are 20 pieces (6 + 14 = 20). Now, we need to find out how many more chicken pieces are required to make 7 additional chicken kebabs. To do this, we will divide the number of chicken pieces in the original recipe by the number of chicken kebabs made (7). So, 20 / 7 = 3. Therefore, an additional 3 chicken pieces are needed to make 7 extra chicken kebabs.
Response:  We have 11 chicken and 9 eggs in the first batch. If we want to make 12 pies with 4 chicken pieces each and 10 egg pie crusts, then we will need an additional 3 chicken pieces (since there are only 11 original chicken pieces) and 3 more egg pie crusts (since there are already 9 egg pie crusts). Therefore, the total number of chicken pieces needed is 16 (3 + 3 = 6), and the total number of egg pie crusts needed is 13 (9 + 3 = 13).
Response:  The first cookie has 3 chunks of chocolate and 10 pieces of nuts. If he gives away 6 cookies in total, then each cookie must have had at least 6/10 = 2 pieces of nuts. So, there are at least 2 x 3 = 6 chunks of chocolate in each cookie. Therefore, there are at least 6 + 6 = 12 chunks of chocolate in total.
Response:  The recipe has 9 chicken pieces and 14 oatmeal pieces, so in total there are 23 pieces (9 + 14). Now, out of these 23 pieces, 4 have already been taken for the first serving of 4 chicken pieces and 4 oatmeal pieces. So, the remaining number of pieces after taking the first serving is 23 - 4 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 pieces left to be distributed among the 4 servings of shogor kebab.
Response:  We have 9 chicken pieces (7 + 4), and we need to distribute them among 8 people. So each person will get 1 chicken piece. Now, out of these 8 people, 2 are already eating their chicken pieces, leaving us with 6 people who still don't have any chicken. Therefore, there are 6 remaining people who haven't received any chicken yet.
Response:  We have 11 chicken pieces and 6 oatmeal pieces in the first batch. Since we want to make 9 cupcakes with chocolate frosting, we will need 3 more chicken pieces (since each cupcake requires 3 chicken pieces). So, in total, we will use 14 chicken pieces (11 + 3) for making these cupcakes. Similarly, since we already had 6 oatmeal pieces, we will still have 6 oatmeal pieces left after using them all up. Therefore, there are 6 oatmeal pieces remaining.
Response:  We have been given that there are 12 chickens in total and we need to distribute them equally among 4 cages. So, each cage will get 3 chickens. Now, let's count how many chickens Mr. Ali has already distributed - he has distributed 4 chickens so far. Therefore, the remaining chickens (12 - 4 = 8) will be distributed among the remaining 3 cages, which means each cage will get 2 chickens (8 / 3 = 2).
Response:  The first batch of cookies contained 12 chocolate chip and 14 oatmeal raisin cookies. After that, he gave away 10 chocolate chip cookies. Now, to determine how many oatmeal raisin cookies are left, we need to subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies given away from the total number of oatmeal raisin cookies in the first batch. So, there are 14 - 10 = 4 oatmeal raisin cookies left.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 19 camels owned by the Bedouins who live nearby. If 60 camels were transported from one place to another during the summer season, then out of these 60 camels, 41 camels belonged to the Bedouins living near the area where they were transported (since there were 19 camels already belonging to them). Therefore, the number of camels that belong to the Bedouins living far away is 29 (60 - 41 = 29).
Response:  If there are 87 people living in the area of ​​the mountain range and they have to migrate due to climate change, then it is likely that some of them will move towards other areas where the climate is more suitable for their survival.  Therefore, we can assume that out of these 87 people, at least 70 (or 75%) may migrate to other areas.  So, the number of people who will remain in the mountainous region after migration would be approximately 17 (or 23%).
Response:  We know that there are 20 camels and their owners in one place (Pehra). And 14 of these camel owners have moved away from Pehra towards the direction of Sarmada. So, the number of camel owners who remained at Pehra is 6 (20 - 14 = 6).
Response:  According to the given information, there are currently 85 donkeys in the area near Pahar. If 23 of these donkeys belong to Africans and 37 belong to Asians, then the number of donkeys that belong to each group is:  Number of African donkey owners = 23 / 85 x 100% = 27.6% Number of Asian donkey owners = 37 / 85 x 100% = 43.9% Therefore, out of the total 85 donkeys, approximately 27.6% (or 23) belong to African owners, while around 43.9% (or 37) belong to Asian owners.
Response:  If there are currently 8 elephants in Africa and 31 elephants in Asia who have migrated to Europe, then the total number of elephants that have migrated from their original homes to Europe is 8 + 31 = 49 elephants.
Response:  If there are currently 38 camels belonging to the Bedouins in the nearby desert and if 47 of them have migrated to Africa and 94 have migrated to Asia, then the number of camel owners who have moved their camels from the Near East to other regions is:  Number of camel owners who have moved their camels = Total number of camel owners - Number of camel owners in the Near East  = 105 - 38 = 67  Therefore, there are 67 camel owners who have moved their camels from the Near East to other regions.
"Response:  If there are currently 18 camels in the desert and they are reproducing at a rate of 38 per year (as mentioned in the question), then after 5 years, there will be:

18 x 38 = 672 camels in the desert

Now, if we assume that 80% of these camels migrate to other countries each year (as also mentioned in the question), then the number of camels remaining in the desert after 5 years would be:

672 x 0.8 = 549 camels

Therefore, after 5 years, approximately 549 camels will remain in the desert."
Response:  According to the given information, there are currently 87 donkeys in the area near Pahar. If 18 of these donkeys belong to new owners who have recently moved into the area, then the number of donkey owners in the area would be:  Number of donkey owners = Total number of donkeys x Percentage of new owners  Number of donkey owners = 87 x 18/100 = 16 So, there are approximately 16 donkey owners living near Pahar.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 49 families of camels in the nearby desert who have migrated due to the hot weather. Out of these, 24 families have reached the oasis and 35 families are still in the desert. Therefore, the number of families of camels that have reached the oasis is 24.
Response:  If there are currently 27 elephants whose owners have fled to escape the heat, and these owners had previously owned 41 elephants in total, then we can calculate the number of elephants whose owners have fled as follows: Number of elephants whose owners have fled = Total number of elephants x Percentage of owners who have fled = 41 x (27/41) = 13 elephants Therefore, out of 41 elephants, 13 elephants have their owners who have fled to escape the heat.
Response:  If there are 86 donkeys in an area and they have to migrate due to extreme heat, then it means that each donkey has to travel around 0.97 miles (1.56 km) to reach their destination. Since there are 45 donkey owners who have moved ahead of them, each owner has to accommodate around 1.89 donkeys (45 / 24 = 1.89). Therefore, the total number of donkeys that can be transported per owner is around 1.89 x 86 = 159.3 donkeys.
Response:  If there are currently 41 elephants in Africa and 62 elephants in Asia who have migrated to Europe, then we need to find out how many elephants from Africa have migrated to Europe. To do this, we will subtract the number of African elephants that are still in Africa (41) from the total number of elephants that have migrated to Europe (103). Therefore, the number of African elephants that have migrated to Europe is 60 (103 - 41).
Response:  According to the given information, there are currently 30 camels in the desert who belong to three owners. Of these, 26 camels have their owners living nearby, while the remaining four camels have their owners living far away in the south. So, out of the total number of camel owners, 24 (i.e., 26 - 2) live near Pahar and the remaining six (i.e., 4) live far away in the south. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  According to the question, Paal has written 253 pages of his autobiography so far. Now, he is in his 80th year and has been writing for 60 years. Therefore, he has written around 14,900 (253 x 60) pages during these 60 years. However, it is not mentioned how many books he has published or given away during this time. So, we cannot calculate the exact number of books he has written.
Response:  According to the given information, Pal had 551 pence in his pocket at the beginning of the year and spent £384 during the year. So, he had £167 left after spending all that money.
Response:  Pal has invested $440 in his salon and made $111 profit during an educational year. To find out how many pennies there were in total, we need to divide the profit by the price of one penny. So, $111 / $0.01 = 11100 pennies. Therefore, there were 11100 pennies left after Pal gave away 106 pennies to his friends.
Response:  According to the question, Pal spent $65 on his salon and gave away $213 to his friends during that year. So, he gained $213 - $65 = $148. Therefore, 148 pence were given away as gifts.
Response:  According to the question, Pal spent $589 with his friends during his educational year. He gave away $571 to them and kept $161 for himself. So, he gave away 571/2 = 285 pints of money to his friends.
Response:  According to the given information, Pal spent $110 on his own salary during that year. He also gave away $90 to his friends. So, the total amount of money he spent is $110 + $90 = $200. Now, let's calculate how much he has left after giving away $412 to his friends. The remaining amount would be $412 - $200 = $212. Therefore, Pal has $212 left after giving away $412 to his friends.
"Response:  According to the given information, Pal had 1000 pennies in his possession at one point of time and he gave away 563 pennies during his educational year. So, the number of pennies left with him after giving away 563 pennies is:

Number of pennies left = Total number of pennies - Number of pennies given away
= 1000 - 563
= 437

Therefore, out of 1000 pennies, Pal has 437 pennies left with him."
Response:  If Pal had $52 in his pocket at the beginning of the year and he gave away $535 to his friends during that year, then he must have had less than $587 ($52 + $535) in his pocket at the end of the year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, if we divide the amount he had left in his pocket by the number of weeks, we get: $$ \frac {587}{52} = 11.06 $$ So, Pal had exactly 11 dollars and 6 cents left in his pocket at the end of the year.
Response:  According to the question, PAL had 521 employees and earned $66 million in revenue last year. In the end of the year, they had only 154 employees left. So, we need to find out how many employees were fired or resigned during that time. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of Employees Fired/Resigned = (Revenue - Total Revenue at Start of Year) / Total Revenue at Start of Year x 100% Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Number of Employees Fired/Resigned = ($66 million - $78 million) / $78 million x 100% = -39% Therefore, according to the information provided, 39% of Pal's employees were either fired or resigned during the year.
Response:  According to the given information, Pal had 531 cars and 38 residences in his possession at the end of the year. Now, he sold all of them and earned $40 million as profit. So, he has $40 million / 531 = $76,255 per car sold. Since he sold 391 cars, he earned $76,255 x 391 = $29,572,555 from selling those cars alone. Additionally, he also earned $40 million from selling his 38 residences, which is equal to $40,000,000 / 38 = $1,057,795 per residence sold. Therefore, in total, Pal earned $29,572,555 + $1,057,795 = $30,630,340 from selling both his cars and residences.
Response:  According to the given information, Pal had 601 crown and 406 residences at the end of the year. In total, he had 336 residents left in his possession after selling some of them. Now, we need to find out how many residences were sold by Pal during that time period. To do this, we will divide the number of residences he had at the beginning of the year (406) by the number of months passed since the start of the year (12). This gives us an average monthly sale rate of 33.675 (rounded to two decimal places). Since there are 30 days in each month, we can multiply this average monthly sale rate by 30 to get the total number of residences sold by Pal during that time period, which is approximately 1009 ( rounded to one decimal place). Therefore, as per the given information, Pal sold around 1009 residences during that particular year.
Response:  According to the question, Pal had 291 children in his lifetime and he lived for 70 years. So, we can calculate the total number of pints as follows: Total points = Number of children x Lifetime (in years) Total points = 291 x 70 = 19,670 points Now, according to the question, Pal gave away 315 or more pens to others during his lifetime. So, we need to subtract this amount from the total points calculated above: Subtracted points = Total points - Gifted points Total points - 315 = 19,670 - 315 = 19,355 points Therefore, Pal had approximately 19,355 points in his lifetime.
Response:  According to the given information, Pal has completed his education in 267 pints and has distributed 308 pints among his friends during his educational year. So, he has left with 41 pints (308 - 267).
Response:  According to the question, PAL had 457 rezerves and 320 pints in their bank account at the end of last year (2019). So, they had a total amount of Rs. 457 x 320 = Rs. 146,840 in their bank account. Now, let's assume that Pal spent all his money on buying pens and did not save any for himself or his family. In this case, he would have bought exactly 523 pens with the entire amount of Rs. 146,840. Therefore, there are 523 pens left after Pal purchased them all.
Response:  The first vet has 11 dogs in his care. After some time, he is able to find homes for 3 of them, leaving him with 8 dogs left. Now, there are 8 dogs that have been adopted and 4 dogs that are still at the shelter. So, the total number of dogs that were adopted from the shelter is 8.
Response:  The first vet has 3 dogs. After that, he got 4 more dogs. So, in total, the vet has 3 + 4 = 7 dogs now.
Response:  The first vet had 9 dogs in his care after which he got 12 more dogs. So, the total number of dogs that the vet had in his care is: 9 + 12 = 21 dogs.
Response:  The given vector has 14 elements. If we subtract 5 elements from it, then the remaining elements are 9. So, there are 9 vectors in the original set that have not been changed or modified. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 9.
Response:  The first vetter has 13 guests. After some time, 4 new guests arrive at his place. If he still has 9 guests now, then how many guests are left? So, the answer is 9 guests are left.
Response:  The first vetter has 12 balls in his possession initially. When 15 more balls are added to him, he now has 27 balls (12 + 15). Now, when 14 of these balls are taken away from him, he is left with 13 balls (27 - 14 = 13). So, there are 13 balls left with the vetter after 14 balls have been taken away from him.
Response:  The first vetter has 3 guests at his place. After that, he goes to another house and meets 8 more people there. So, in total, the vetter met 11 people (3 + 8).
Response:  The first vetter has 8 balls in his hand. After giving some of them to another person, he now has 5 balls left. So, initially, there were 13 balls (8 + 5). Now, out of these 13 balls, 99 are remaining with him, which means that 40 balls have been taken away from him (13 - 99 = 40). Therefore, there are 40 balls left with other people.
Response:  The first vetter has 12 balls in his hand initially. After some time, he gets 14 more balls. Now, he has a total of 26 balls (12 + 14). So, there are 10 fewer balls with him now than he had initially. Therefore, the number of balls he currently has is 10.
Response:  Denny had $3 left after buying something from Saatish for $2. Then he bought a chocolate bar worth $1 from him again. So, initially, Denny had $3 - $2 = $1 left with him. After buying the chocolate bar, his remaining amount became $1 - $1 = $0. Therefore, initially, Denny had $1 left with him.
Response:  Denny has $4 and he spent $1 on a candy bar. So, he has $3 left. Now, he wants to buy another candy bar worth $2. How much will he have left after buying this second candy bar?  Therefore, the answer is $1 ($3 - $2).
Response:  Denny has sold 99 chocolates at $4 each, which means he has earned $990 in total. Now, we need to find out how many dollars are left after buying 3 chocolates for $3 each. So, if Denny spent $3 x 3 = $9 on those three chocolates, then he has $990 - $9 = $901 left. Therefore, there are $901 remaining dollars.
Response:  Dean bought two chocolates for $3 each. So he spent a total of $6 (2 x $3). Now, we need to find out how much each chocolate cost him per piece. To do this, we divide the total amount he spent ($6) by the number of chocolates he bought (2): $6 / 2 = $3 per chocolate. Therefore, each chocolate cost Dean $3.
Response:  Denny sold each chocolate bar for $3, and he bought them in bulk at $6 per box of 10 bars. So, if he bought x boxes of chocolate bars, his total cost would be: Total Cost = Number of Boxes x Cost Per Box = x x $6 = $x Now, we are asked how many times Denny bought the chocolate bars. We can use this information to find out the value of x. According to the question, Denny bought the chocolate bars 4 times. Therefore, the value of x is: x = 4 So, Denny bought 4 boxes of chocolate bars, which means he spent a total of $4 (4 x $6).
Response:  Denny spent $ 7 on one chocolate bar and $ 3 on another chocolate bar. So he has spent a total of $ 10. Now we need to find out how much money is left with him. Total amount spent = $ 10 Amount left with him = $ 10 - $ 7 = $ 3 So there are $ 3 left with Denny.
Response:  Dean spent $ 4 in one restaurant and $ 6 in another restaurant. So he has spent a total of $ 10 ( $ 4 + $ 6). Now, he got $ 3 as change from the first restaurant and $ 2 as change from the second restaurant. Therefore, he has $ 5 left with him ($ 10 - $ 3 - $ 2).
Response:  Dean bought one chocolate bar for $2 and another for $3. So, he spent a total of $5 (2 + 3). Now, he has $7 left after buying the two chocolates ($10 - $5 = $7).
Response:  Dean spent $ 5 for one chocolate bar and $ 3 for another chocolate bar. So he spent a total of $ 8. Now, to find out how much more he paid for the second chocolate bar than the first one, we need to subtract the cost of the first chocolate bar from the total amount he spent: ($ 8 - $ 5) = $ 3. Therefore, Dean paid $ 3 more for the second chocolate bar than the first one.
Response:  Denny bought a calculator for $ 4 and gave it to his friend as a gift worth $ 8. Now, we need to find out how much money his friend gave him in return. So, if Denny gave his friend $ 8 - $ 4 = $ 4 as a gift, then his friend must have given him $ 4 / $ 1 = $ 4 back. Therefore, his friend gave him $ 4 back.
Response:  Denny sold his car for $3000 after owning it for 5 years. If he had bought it 7 years ago, then its original price was $4000 - $3000 = $1000. So, the cost of that car in 2018 (when Denny sold it) is $1000 / 5 = $200 per year.
Response:  Dean has $4 and he wants to buy something from each of the five stores. The prices of these items are as follows: Store A - $10, Store B - $8, Store C - $6, Store D - $4, and Store E - $2. To find out how many dollars Dean can buy from each store, we need to divide the amount he has ($4) by the price of the item he wants to buy (in each store). So, for Store A, Dean can buy $10 / $4 = 2.5 items. For Store B, he can buy $8 / $4 = 2 items. Similarly, for Stores C, D, and E, he can buy $6 / $4 = 1.5, $4 / $4 = 1, $2 / $4 = 0.5 items respectively. Therefore, in total, Dean can buy $2.5 + $2 + $1.5 + $1 + $0.5 = $7 items from these five stores using his entire budget of $4.
Response:  Dean has spent $ 3 for each chocolate bar and he bought 4 chocolate bars in total. So, he spent $ 3 x 4 = $ 12 for all four chocolate bars. Now, we need to find out how much one chocolate bar costs. Since Dean paid $ 12 for 4 chocolate bars, the cost of one chocolate bar is $ 12 / 4 = $ 3 per chocolate bar.
Response:  Dean spent $ 5 for one chocolate bar and $ 7 for another chocolate bar. So in total he spent $ 12 ( $ 5 + $ 7). Now we need to find out how many chocolate bars Dean bought with the money he received from selling his car. Since Dean sold his car for $ 3000, he got $ 3000 - $ 12 = $ 2988 left after buying the two chocolate bars. Therefore, Dean bought 2988 / $ 7 = 416 chocolate bars.
Response:  Dean spent $ 4 to buy one chocolate and $ 2 to buy one candy bar. So he spent in total $ 6 ( $ 4 + $ 2). Now we need to find out how much money did he save buying these candies instead of other snacks? To do this, we will subtract the amount he spent from the original price of the chocolate. The original price of the chocolate was $ 1 each, so if Dean bought one chocolate for $ 4, then he saved $ 3 ($ 4 - $ 1) by buying that chocolate instead of any other snack costing $ 1 each. Similarly, if he bought one candy bar for $ 2, then he saved $ 1 ($ 2 - $ 1) by buying that candy bar instead of any other snack costing $ 1 each. Therefore, Dean saved a total of $ 4 ($ 3 + $ 1) by buying those candies instead of other snacks.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 115 books in total.  Out of these, Ali has sold 78 books. So, the number of books that Ali did not sell is:

Number of books not sold = Total number of books - Number of books sold = 115 - 78 = 37

Therefore, out of the 115 books, 37 books remain with Ali."
"Response:  The bookshelf had 137 books in total and after selling 105 of them, there were 32 left. So, the number of books that were initially present on the shelf is:

Number of books = Initial quantity - Number sold
= 137 - 105
= 32"
Response:  Firstly, out of 108 books, 35 were given away as gifts to friends after reading 10 books. So, the remaining number of books with him is 73 (108 - 35). Then, he read another 10 books and gave away 15 more books as gifts, leaving him with 58 books (73 - 15). Therefore, in total, he has 58 books left with him.
"Response:  According to the given information, initially there were 50 books in the library. After selling some of them, the number of books reduced to 151. So, the number of books that he sold is:

Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Final number of books
= 50 - 151
= -101

Therefore, he sold 101 books."
Response:  Initially, there were two books in his possession. He sold one of them for Rs. 150 and after that, he had 58 books left with him. So, the number of books he sold is: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Remaining number of books after selling one book = 58 - 2 = 56 Books sold
Response:  According to the given information, initially there were 21 books in the library and one of them was sold for Rs. 42. After selling this book, the number of books left in the library is 15. So, if he had sold 42 books, then the total number of books he sold would be 42 x 15 = 630 books.
Response:  Initially, there were 71 books in the library. After selling one book for Rs. 38, he had 116 books left with him. So, if he sold some more books after that, then the number of books he has now is: Number of books = Initial number of books - Number of books sold = 71 - x Where x is the number of books he sold later. Now we are given that he sold 38 books earlier, so the total number of books he sold = 38. Therefore, the number of books he has now = 71 - 38 = 33.
Response:  According to the given information, initially Pal had 108 books and 55 pens. After some time, he gave away 66 books and 59 pens. So, at present, Pal has 42 books and 36 pens left with him.
Response:  According to the given information, initially Pal had 51 books and 106 pens. After giving some books and pens away, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens. So, the number of books that Pal gave away is 79 (51 - 82). Similarly, the number of pens that he gave away is 92 (106 - 14).
Response:  According to the given information, PAL published 27 books in Graaj's memory and distributed them among 27 libraries. Now, if we assume that each library received an equal number of books (which is not explicitly mentioned), then the total number of books distributed would be:  Number of libraries x Total number of books distributed per library = 27 x? = 27 x 20 = 540 books. Therefore, PAL distributed 540 books in honor of Graaj.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 134 books in total that Pal has. He then gives away 39 of them to his friend and sells some of them at a garage sale, leaving him with 68 books. So, the number of books that Pal sold is 68 - 39 = 29 books.
Response:  According to the given information, initially there were 95 books and 153 pages in the library. After some books and pages were removed, 13 books and 23 pages remained in the library. So, the number of books that were removed from the library is: Number of remaining books = Initial number of books - Remaining books after removal = 95 - 13 = 82 books. Similarly, the number of pages that were removed from the library is: Number of remaining pages = Initial number of pages - Remaining pages after removal = 153 - 23 = 130 pages.
Response:  According to the given information, initially there were 42 books and 143 pages in Pal's bag. After removing some books and pages, there were 113 books and 19 pages left in his bag. So, the number of books that Pal removed from his bag is: Number of books remaining in the bag = 113 Books initially in the bag - Number of books removed = 42 - x Where 'x' represents the number of books removed by Pal. Therefore, the value of 'x' is 71 (i.e., 113 - 42).
Response:  Guldan has 10 flowers in his garden and he wants to divide them equally among 4 friends. So, each friend will get 2.5 flowers (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now, there are 4 friends, so the total number of flowers that Guldan has given away is 4 x 2.5 = 10 flowers. Therefore, there are still 6 flowers left in his garden (10 - 10 = 0).
Response:  According to the given information, there were initially 16 flowers in the garden and then Guldan added more 10 flowers (i.e., 23 flowers in total). So, the number of flowers in the garden now is 23.
"Response:  Guldan has 4 gulabs in his garden and he wants to exchange them with Jaisa for some new gulabs from her garden. If each gulab weighs 0.5 kg, then the total weight of the gulabs that Guldan has is:

4 x 0.5 = 2 kg

Now, let's find out how many gulabs Jaisa has given to Guldan. According to the question, Jaisa gave 4 gulabs to Guldan. So, the total number of gulabs that Jaisa has is:

4 x 0.5 = 2 kg (as before)

Therefore, there are 2 kg of gulabs in Jaisa's garden, which means she has 2 kg / 1 kg = 2 gulabs."
Response:  Initially, there were 15 apples in Glenda's bag. Jack took 33 apples from her bag and gave her some of his own apples to make up for it. So, initially, Glenda had 15 + (33 - 15) = 28 apples in her bag. Now, she has 28 - 17 = 11 apples left in her bag. Therefore, Jack took away 14 apples from Glenda's bag (17 - 15).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jaisa had 21 grapes in his bag and he gave 34 grapes to Guldan. So, initially, there were 21 + 34 = 55 grapes in Guldan's bag. Now, we are told that after giving some of these grapes to Guldan, there are only 15 grapes left in Guldan's bag. Therefore, the number of grapes that Jaisa gave to Guldan is equal to 55 - 15 = 40 grapes.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 59 grapes in total in the garden. Out of these, 20 grapes have been picked already. So, the number of grapes left in the garden is: 59 - 20 = 39 grapes.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 13 flowers in Guldan's garden and 12 of them have been picked for the exhibition. So, the number of flowers left in the garden is 13 - 12 = 1. Therefore, there are 1 flower remaining in the garden.
Response:  Glenn has 15 apples and 62 oranges in his garden. He planted some of them and now he has 17 apples and 96 orchids in his garden. So, initially, Glenn had 15 + 62 = 77 plants in his garden. Now, he has 17 + 96 = 113 plants in his garden. Therefore, the number of plants that Glenn added is 113 - 77 = 36 plants.
Response:  Glenn has 12 apples and 2 oranges in his bag. He gave away 3 apples to someone else and kept 7 apples for himself. Now he has 10 apples left in his bag. As for the oranges, he gave away 1 orange to someone else and kept 1 orange with him, so now he has 2 oranges left in his bag. Therefore, the number of apples Glenn has now is 10, and the number of oranges he has is 2.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 5 bags of grapes and 3 arks in Gol Dand. Now, we need to find out how many grapes are left after some grapes were taken away for making wine. The question states that 5 bags of grapes were used for making wine, so let's subtract 5 from the total number of grapes in Gol Dand. There are currently 12 bags of grapes in Gol Dand, so if we subtract 5, then the remaining number of bags of grapes is: 12 - 5 = 7 bags of grapes left in Gol Dand. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. According to the question, 3 arks were filled with water from the well in Gol Dand. So, the total number of arks in Gol Dand is now: 3 + 3 (since each ark can hold 3 buckets of water) = 6 arks in Gol Dand. Therefore, the final answer to the question is: 7 bags of grapes and 6 arks in Gol Dand.
Response:  According to the question, there were initially 7 gulabs and 12 orchids in Jiska's garden. Now, Jiska has taken some of his flowers (gulabs) out of the garden and given them away as gifts. So, the number of gulabs left in the garden is now less than 7. Moreover, Jiska also gave away some of his orchids as gifts. Therefore, the number of orchids left in the garden is also less than 12.  To calculate the exact number of gulabs and orchids left in the garden, we need to use the information provided in the question. We know that Jiska took 3 gulabs from the garden and gave them away as gifts. So, the number of gulabs left in the garden after he took them is 7 - 3 = 4. Similarly, we know that Jiska gave away 5 orchids as gifts. So, the number of orchids left in the garden after he gave them away is 12 - 5 = 7.  Therefore, the final number of gulabs left in Jiska's garden is 4, and the final number of orchids left in the garden is 7.
"Response: 
Jiska has 19 gulabs in her garden and she wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get how many gulabs?
To find out, we need to divide the total number of gulabs (19) by the number of friends (5).
So, each friend will get 3.8 gulabs (19 / 5 = 3.8)."
Response:  According to the given information, initially there were 13 gulabs and 84 sterilizers in the garden. Now, out of these, 91 sterilizers are left and only 14 gulabs remain. So, the number of gulab khatai (gulabs that have been used) is 14.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 16 flowers in the garden and 3 trees (gulmohar). So, we have:

Flowers = 16
Trees = 3
Now, each tree has 7 branches, so we can calculate the total number of branches as follows:

Total branches = Number of trees x Number of branches per tree
= 3 x 7
= 21
Therefore, there are 21 branches in the garden."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 6 gulabs and 20 orchids in Jiska's garden. Now, Jiska has taken some of his flowers and plants from his garden and put them in another place (which is not specified). So, let's assume that he took half of the total number of flowers and plants from his original garden. Therefore, the number of flowers and plants left in his original garden will be half of 6 + 20 = 14. Similarly, the number of gulabs left in the garden after Jiska took some away will also be half of 6 = 3. So, the final answer is: Number of flowers in Jiska's garden before he took any away = 14 Number of gulabs in Jiska's garden before he took any away = 3
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 13 orchards and 3 gardens in the village of Galadan. Each orchard has many trees, but we don't know exactly how many because it depends on various factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, etc. However, based on our experience, an average orchard usually contains around 50-70 trees. So, if we assume that each orchard in Galadan has around 60 trees (which is a reasonable estimate), then the total number of trees in all 13 orchards would be: 13 x 60 = 780 trees. Now, let's calculate the number of grapes produced per year. We know that each tree produces around 20-40 kilograms of grapes, depending on the variety and growing conditions. So, if we assume an average production of 30 kilograms per tree, then the total number of grapes produced by all 780 trees in Galadan would be: 780 x 30 = 23,400 kilograms of grapes per year.
Response:  According to the given information, Rohan has 17 balls in his basket and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 of his friends. So, each friend will get how many balls?  We know that Rohan has 13 balls left after distributing 4 balls to his friends. Therefore, the number of balls distributed to each friend is: Number of balls distributed = Total number of balls available for distribution - Number of balls already distributed = 17 - 4 = 13 So, each friend gets 13 balls from Rohan.
Response:  If Raja has 20 cats and he gives 10 of them to Rabbani, then initially (before giving any cats to Rabbani), Raja had 20 - 10 = 10 cats with him. So, initially, Raja had 10 cats.
Response:  Initially, Rabban had 16 balls in his basket. He gave away 11 of them to someone else. Now he has 5 balls left (16 - 11 = 5). Then, he got 12 more balls from somewhere. So, now Rabban has 5 + 12 = 17 balls in his basket.
Response:  If Rohan had grown to 19 inches tall at the age of 10, then he would have been 6 feet 4 inches (19 x 2 = 38) tall now. However, since he is only 6 feet 4 inches tall, we can deduce that he has not grown beyond his current height. Therefore, the number of limbs he had at the age of 10 was equal to the number of limbs he has now, which is 4. So, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  According to the given information, Rabban has 13 cats in his house and each cat has 7 kittens. So, the total number of kittens Rabban has is: 13 x 7 = 91 kittens. Therefore, Rabban has 91 kittens in his house.
Response:  Initially, there were 14 balls in Rabban's basket. He added 8 more balls to it, making the total number of balls 22. Now, he has given away 20 balls. So, the remaining number of balls in his basket is: 22 - 20 = 2.
Response:  Denny has 12 balls in his basket and he put them back into his bag after taking out 53 balls from the park. So, initially, Denny had 12 balls in his basket, and now he has 53 - 12 = 41 balls left in his bag. Therefore, there are 41 balls left with Denny.
Response:  Denny has 21 toy cars in his collection and he placed them in his room. Later, some more toy cars entered the park where Denny had placed his collection. If there are currently 53 toy cars in the park, then Denny must have placed 32 toy cars in the park (53 - 21 = 32).
Response:  Denny has collected 63 tops from different bottles in the park and given away 51 of them. So, he now has 33 bottle caps left with him. To find out how many bottles Denny had initially, we can divide the total number of bottle caps he had (63) by the number of bottle caps he gave away (51). Therefore, Denny had 63 / 51 = 12 bottles initially.
Response:  Denny has 36 balls in his park and he gives away 35 of them to others. So, now he has 22 balls left in his possession.
Response:  Denny has 30 tops in his park and he gave away 63 pennies from those tops. So now he has 42 tops left in his collection. To find out how many pennies are there in each top, we need to divide the total number of pennies (63) by the number of tops (42). Therefore, each top contains approximately 1.5 pennies.
Response:  Denny has 22 bottles of juice and 8 peppers in his park. Now he has added 20 more bottles of juice and 4 more peppers to his collection. So, the total number of bottles of juice Denny has now is 22 + 20 = 42 bottles. Similarly, the total number of peppers he has is 8 + 4 = 12 peppers. Therefore, the final answer is 42 bottles of juice and 12 peppers.
Response:  Denny had 22 bottles of coke and 30 peppers in his park. Now he has 17 bottles of Coke and 57 peppers left. So initially, Denny had more than 57 peppers in his collection. Therefore, the correct answer is (More than 57).
Response:  Denny has 30 bottles of coke and 14 peppers in his park. Now he has 7 bottles of coke and 86 peppers left. So initially, Denny had 30 x 2 = 60 bottles of coke and 14 x 2 = 28 peppers in total. Therefore, Denny had 60 + 28 = 88 bottles and peppers in his park before he distributed them among the people.
Response:  Denny has 11 boats and 28 penguins in his park. Now he has combined them with other parks to make a total of 68 boats and 51 penguins. So, initially Denny had 11/39 = 0.289 (approximately) boats per penguin. After combining with other parks, he now has 68/51 = 0.135 (approximately) boats per penguin.
Response:  Denny has 71 boats and 24 penguins in his park. Now he has 28 boats and 16 penguins in his collection. So, initially Denny had 71 - 28 = 43 boats and 24 + 16 = 40 penguins. Therefore, Denny had 43 boats and 40 penguins initially.
Response:  Denny has 10 bottles of coke and 62 peppers in his park. He gives 27 bottles of coke to his friend and keeps 43 peppers for himself. So, initially, Denny had 10 x 10 = 100 bottles of coke and 62 x 2 = 124 peppers (since he gave 27 bottles away). Now, after giving some away, Denny has 43 peppers left with him. Therefore, the number of peppers Denny has now is 124 - 43 = 81 peppers.
Response:  Denny has collected 66 tops from different bottles in the park. Now he wants to know how many tops are there in total among all 25 bottles that belong to him. So, the number of tops Denny has is: 66 / 25 = 2.6 (rounded off to two decimal places) Therefore, Denny has 26 tops in total.
Response:  According to the given information, Denny had 32 top boxes in his collection after he got rid of 25 boxes from his initial collection of 50 boxes. So, the number of boxes Denny has now is: 32 - 25 = 8 boxes.
Response:  Denny has collected 60 old pens from the park and given 58 of them to his friend. Now, there are 67 pens in total in Denny's collection. So, Denny has 9 more pens than he gave to his friend. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  Denny has collected 60 tops from the park and he had given 50 of them to other kids. So, now he has 10 tops left with him.
Response:  According to the given information, Denny has collected 54 old tires from different places and he has thrown away 48 of them in the park. So, now there are 6 (54 - 48) tires left with him. Since he wants to give some tires to the people who come to the park, let's assume that he gives 3 tires to each person. Therefore, the total number of tires Denny will give = 3 x 52 = 156 tires.
Response:  Denny has 82 leaves and 29 bottles in his park. He has already put 42 bottles and 61 peppers in his collection. So, he still needs to collect 20 more bottles (82 - 42 = 40) and 30 more peppers (61 - 31 = 30). Therefore, Denny needs to collect 50 more items from the park.
Response:  Denny has 66 leaves and 39 bottles in his park. He has already picked 16 bottle caps and 68 peppers. So, he still has 30 bottles with their caps (69 total).
Response:  Denny has 46 leaves and 50 bottles in his park. He has picked up 21 bottle caps and 52 peppers from the park. So, he had 46 + 50 = 96 items in total before picking anything up. After picking up the bottle caps and peppers, he now has 21 + 52 = 73 items left with him. Therefore, there were originally 96 - 73 = 23 more bottles than leaves in the park that Denny picked up.
Response:  Denny has 65 leaves and 5 butterflies in his park. He has placed them in different spots so that each spot contains at least one leaf or one butterfly. Therefore, there are 65! = 702,845,722 possible combinations of leaves and butterflies that Denny could have placed in his park. Now, we need to find out how many of these combinations contain exactly 31 leaves and 9 butterflies. To do this, we can use the formula C(n, k), which gives us the number of ways to choose n objects from a set of k objects, where n is the total number of objects (in this case, 702,845,722) and k is the number of objects we want to choose (in this case, 31 for the leaves and 9 for the butterflies). So, the number of combinations that Denny could have made with exactly 31 leaves and 9 butterflies is: C(702,845,722,31) x C(702,845,722,9) = 1,070,512,827,776. Therefore, there were approximately 1.07 billion combinations that Denny could have made with exactly 31 leaves and 9 butterflies in his park.
Response:  Denny has 58 tops and 25 peppers in his park. Now he wants to combine them into one big pile. After combining, he has 11 peppers and 12 bot...
Response:  Denny has 15 tops and 18 peppers in his park. If we combine all of them, he will have 67 peppers and 35 bot...
"Response:  If Jack has 11 friends and each friend brings 17 guests, then the total number of people at the party is:

11 (friends) x 17 (guests per friend) = 187

So, there are 187 people at the party."
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 balls in his pocket and he gives 14 balls to Jill. So, now Jack has 7 - 14 = -7 balls in his pocket. Since we are asked how many balls Jack has in total, including the ones he gave to Jill, we add the number of balls he had initially (7) with the number of balls he gave to Jill (-7). Therefore, the final answer is: 7 + (-7) = 0 balls.
Response:  We know that Jack has 18 balls in his pocket and he gives 13 of them to Jill. So, now Jack has 5 balls left (18 - 13 = 5). Now, we are asked how many balls Jill has. Since Jill gets 13 balls from Jack, she has 13 + 5 = 18 balls in total. Therefore, Jill has 18 balls.
Response:  We know that Jack has 20 stations and each station has 5 cars. So, in total, Jack has 20 x 5 = 100 cars.
Response:  We know that Jack has 12 stones and Gil has 11 more than him. So, Gil has 23 stones in total (11 + 12 = 23). Now, we are asked how many stones Jack has. Since Jack has 12 stones and Gil has 23 stones, it means that Jack has 12 - 23 = -11 stones less than Gil. Therefore, Jack has -11 stones.
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 balls in his pocket and he gives 3 of them to Jill. So now Jack has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left. Now, we are told that Jill has 9 balls more than Jack. So, if Jack has 4 balls, then Jill must have 4 + 9 = 13 balls. Therefore, there are 13 balls in total.
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 less than Jill's number of marbles. So, if Jill has x marbles, then Jack has x - 7 marbles. Now we are told that Jill has 8 more marbles than Steve. So, if Steve has y marbles, then Jill has y + 8 marbles. Finally, we are asked how many marbles Jack has. Since Jack has x - 7 marbles and Jill has y + 8 marbles, we can set up the equation: x - 7 = y + 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 17. Therefore, Jack has 17 marbles.
Response:  From station A to station B, there are 9 km distance and from station B to station C, there is 18 km distance. So, in total, there are 9 + 18 = 27 km distance between these two stations. Therefore, there are 27 - 16 = 11 more kilometers between station C and station A than between station A and station B.
Response:  We know that in station 6, there are 6 less jacks than stations. So, if there are 18 excess jackets in station 1, then there will be 12 (18 - 6) excess jackets in station 6. Therefore, the number of excess jackets in station 6 is 12.
Response:  We know that in Jack's box, there are 5 small balls. In Jill's box, there are 18 large balls. If Jill has 87 balls in total, then how many small balls does Jack have?  To find out, we can divide the number of large balls (18) by the number of small balls (5), which gives us 3.6. So, Jack has approximately 3.6 small balls in his box.
Response:  We know that Jack has 16 balls and Steve has 15 more than Jack. So, Steve has 16 + 15 = 31 balls in total. Now, if there are 12 balls less than what Steve has, then Steve has 31 - 12 = 20 balls left. Therefore, the number of balls left with Steve is 20.
Response:  We know that Jack has 12 inches less than Jill in height and he is 79 inches tall. So, if Jill is x inches tall, then Jack is x - 12 inches tall. Now we are given that Jill is 19 inches taller than Jack, so we can write an equation: Jill = x + (x - 12) = 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 16 inches. Therefore, Jack is 16 - 12 = 4 inches shorter than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 cm of stationery and 3 excess seeds. So, in total, he has 13 + 3 = 16 cm of stationery. Now, we are told that Stationery has 9 cm and Excess Seeds have 8 cm. Therefore, the number of seeds Jack has is 16 - (9 + 8) = 0 seeds.  So, Jack does not have any seeds.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 small apples and 8 large apples. The total number of apples is 6 + 8 = 14 apples. Now, we need to find out how many big apples are there in 17 inches. To do this, we divide the total number of apples (14) by the height of each apple (in inches). So, the number of big apples in 17 inches is 14 / 3 = 4.5 big apples. Since we can't have half an apple, the actual number of big apples is rounded off to 4 big apples. Therefore, the answer is 4 big apples.
Response:  We know that Jack has 30 less than twice as many books as stations. So, if he has x books, then the number of stations is 2x - 30. Since there are 12 stations and 15 seeds per station, the total number of seeds is 12 x 15 = 180. Therefore, Jack has 180 seeds.
Response:  We know that there are 12 stones in Jack's pocket. From these 12 stones, 4 are smaller than the ones Jill has (which is 67). So, the number of stones that Jack has is: 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, Jack has 8 stones in his pocket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 students in total and 12 of them are from Station A. So, the number of students from Station B is 12 - 12 = 0. Therefore, there are no students from Station B.
"Response:  We know that Station has 19 trains and Jack has 12 less than Station. So, the number of trains in Jack's possession is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ trains\ in\ Jack's\ possession = 12 - 19 = -7 $$

Now, we are also given that Jack has 72 more trains than Jill. Therefore, the total number of trains in Jack's possession is:

$$ \therefore Total\ number\ of\ trains\ in\ Jack's\ possession = 72 + (-7) = 65 $$

So, there are 65 trains in Jack's possession."
"Response:  We know that Station 14 is located at an altitude of 6 stations below and 3 glaciers above. So, we can say that Station 14 is located at an altitude of:

$$ \text{Altitude of Station 14} = \text{Altitude of Station 6} - \text{Height of Glacier 1} + \text{Height of Glacier 2} $$

We are given that the height of Glacier 1 is $3 \times 10^5$ meters and the height of Glacier 2 is $2 \times 10^5$ meters. Therefore, the altitude of Station 14 is:

$$ \text{Altitude of Station 14} = \text{Altitude of Station 6} - (3 \times 10^5) + (2 \times 10^5) $$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$ \text{Altitude of Station 14} = \text{Altitude of Station 6} - 5 \times 10^5 $$

So, there are $5 \times 10^5$ meters between Station 14 and the nearest glacier."
Response:  We know that Jack has 84 trees and 10 poles in his garden. The distance between each pole is 13 feet, and there are 52 trees between two poles. Now, we need to find out how many trees are there between two poles. To do this, we will divide the total number of trees (84) by the distance between two poles (13). So, the number of trees between two poles = 84 / 13 = 6.5 trees per pole. Therefore, there are 6.5 trees between each pole.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 more seeds than Jill and he has 17 less pears than her. So, if Jill has x pears, then Jack has x + 13 seeds. Since Jack has 8 more patches than Jill, Jack has 8x patches. Therefore, the number of seeds Jack has is 8x + 12 (since he has 12 more seeds than Jill). Now we need to find out how many pears Jill has. According to the problem, Jill has x - 17 pears. So, the total number of pears both have together is 8x + 12 - (x - 17) = 8x + 5.
Response:  We know that Jack has 8 inches less than Steve in height and he is 10 inches taller than Steve. So, if Steve is x inches tall, then Jack is x - 8 inches tall. Now we are given that Steve is 11 inches tall and Jack is 18 inches tall. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x - 8) = 18...(1) Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation. x = 26...(2) Therefore, Steve is 26 inches tall and Jack is 26 - 8 = 18 inches tall.
Response:  We know that Jack has 20 apples and 15 pears in his station wagon. Now we want to find out how many apples and pears he has in total. To do this, we need to add the number of apples and pears together. So, the total number of fruits Jack has is: 20 + 15 = 35 fruits. Therefore, Jack has 35 fruits in his station wagon.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rohan earned $78 in total from his part-time job. Now, he spent $15 on a supermarket bill. So, how much money does Rohan have left? To find this out, we need to subtract the amount he spent ($15) from the total amount he earned ($78). Therefore, the number of rupees remaining with Rohan is: $\boxed{63}$
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ali has spent $78 in one supermarket. If he had $33 left after spending, then the amount he spent is equal to $78 / 33 = $2.30 per item.
Response:  Firstly, he had Rs. 100 in his pocket. Then, he spent Rs. 148 with E-Ticket. After that, he got Rs. 159 from the supermarket. So, finally, he had Rs. 100 + Rs. 148 - Rs. 159 = Rs. 297 in his pocket.
Response:  Firstly, Ali had Rs. 20 in his pocket and he spent Rs. 15 on ice cream. So, he has Rs. 5 left (Rs. 20 - Rs. 15 = Rs. 5). Now, he went to an eatery and spent Rs. 49 more than what he already had, so he spent a total of Rs. 54 (Rs. 5 + Rs. 49 = Rs. 54). Therefore, there are Rs. 43 remaining after he paid for food at the eatery (Rs. 54 - Rs. 5 = Rs. 43).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rohan earned $53 in his first job and then he got a raise of 91 dollars from the same company. So, his total earnings after the raise are $144 ($53 + 91). Now, let's find out how much more he earned in other supermarkets compared to his previous salary. We can calculate it as follows: Total earnings after raise = $144 Earning per month in other supermarkets =? (Since he worked for 6 months) Total earnings in other supermarkets = $840 ($144 x 6 months) Therefore, Rohan earned $840 more than his previous salary in other supermarkets.
Response:  Firstly, Ali had Rs. 106 in his pocket and spent Rs. 80 on a supermarket bill. So he was left with Rs. 26. Then, he went to a showroom and bought an item worth Rs. 49. Now, if we subtract the amount he spent at the showroom from the remaining amount in his pocket, we get Rs. 26 - Rs. 49 = -Rs. 23. Therefore, Ali has -Rs. 23 less than what he initially had in his pocket after buying the item from the showroom.
Response:  The speed of the car was $29 \text{ dollars}/\text{km}$. After traveling for $\boxed{29}$ kilometers, it stopped and the driver got out to take a break. So, the distance traveled by the car is $29$ kilometers. Now, we need to find out how much time elapsed during this journey. We know that the speed of the car is $29 \text{ dollars}/\text{km}$, so the time taken to cover $\boxed{29}$ kilometers can be calculated as follows: $$ Time = Distance / Speed $$ Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: $$ Time = 29 \text{ km} / 29 \text{ dollars/km} = 1 \text{ hour} $$ Therefore, the driver spent $1$ hour taking a break after traveling $29$ kilometers.
"Response:  If Ahmad spent $38 in one supermarket and he had $128 before spending, then we can calculate how much money he has left as follows:

Money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
= $128 - $38
= $90

Therefore, Ahmed has $90 left after spending $38 in the supermarket."
Response:  The number of apps that Devi has installed on her phone is 19. She has deleted 5 of them, so the remaining number of apps on her phone is 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 apps left on Devi's phone.
Response:  Devi had 18 apps installed on her phone before she deleted 5 of them. So, there were 18 - 5 = 13 apps left on her phone after deleting those 5 apps.
Response:  The number of phones that Devi had before she deleted 4 of them is given as 10. After deleting 4 phones, the remaining number of phones with her is 6 (10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of phones that Devi has now is 6.
Response:  The number of phones that Devi had before she deleted 21 apps is 89. After deleting those 21 apps, she had 68 phones left (89 - 21 = 68). So, the number of apps that Devi included in her remaining 68 phones is 68 / 21 = 3.26 (round off to 3)
Response:  The original number of friends in Devi's phone was 15. After deleting some of them, she had 71 remaining friends. If she deleted more than half of her friends (which is equal to 15 / 2 = 7), then the number of friends left after deletion would be 7 - 7 = 0. So, Devi has zero friends left in her phone now.
"Response:  The original phone had 16 apps and 77 files. After deleting some of them, there were 5 apps and 23 files left. So, the number of apps that were deleted is:

Number of deleted apps = Number of apps remaining - Original number of apps
= 5 - 16
= -11

Therefore, the number of apps that were deleted is -11."
Response:  The person has 17 apps and 21 files on their phone before deleting 3 apps and 7 files. So after deletion, they have 14 apps and 14 files left.

Response:  We know that in total there are 19 apps and 18 files on Devi's phone. After deleting 6 apps and 15 files from her phone, how many apps and files will remain? Therefore, the number of remaining apps is 13 (19 - 6 = 13), and the number of remaining files is 9 (18 - 15 = 9).
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 17 phones in total and after some time, 18 people joined them. So, the number of apps installed on each phone is:

Number of apps per phone = Total number of phones / Number of people who joined later
= 17 / 18
= 0.94 (or approximately 94%)

Therefore, approximately 94% of the phones have at least one app installed."
Response:  The person has 59 files and 15 apps on their phone before deleting 12 apps and 30 files. So, after deleting those apps and files, they have 47 remaining apps (12 x 4 = 48) and 20 remaining files (30 - 12 = 20).
Response:  The user has 24 files in their phone and they want to delete 13 of them. After deleting those 13 files, there will be 17 remaining files left in the phone.

"Response:  Neil has 242 cards in his deck and he gives Jeff 136 cards from that deck. So, the number of cards left with Neil is:

Number of cards left with Neil = Total number of cards in the deck - Number of cards given to Jeff
= 242 - 136
= 106
Therefore, there are 106 cards left with Neil after giving 136 cards to Jeff."
Response:  Neil has given away 301 cars and now he has only 154 left. So, initially, Neil had 301 cards.
Response:  Neil has 528 cards in his hand and Jeff has 11 cards. Neil gives some of his cards to Jeff, so now Neil has 252 cards left. To find out how many cards Neil gave to Jeff, we can divide the number of cards Neil had before giving any to Jeff (528) by the number of cards he had after giving some to Jeff (252). So, Neil gave 528 - 252 = 276 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Neil has 566 cards in total and gave some to Jeff. Now, there are 535 cards left with Neil. So, Jeff has 234 cards.
Response:  Neil Carard has 309 cars and 356 ten-car lots. He gave some of his cars to Jeff and now he has 415 cars and 149 ten-car lots left. So, there are 415 + 149 = 564 cars in total with Neil Karad.
Response:  Neil Carard has 246 cars and 214 trucks under his possession. He gave some of these vehicles to Jeff, who now has 404 cars and 495 trucks in total. So, there are more than 10 cars left with Neil after he gave them to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is greater than 10.
Response:  Neil has 573 cards in total and gave away 195 cards to Jeff. So, he had 378 cards left (573 - 195 = 378). Now, Neil has given away some more cards to other people, leaving him with 210 cards remaining (378 -? = 210). Therefore, Neil gave away 168 cards to others after giving 195 to Jeff (210 - 168 = 42).
Response:  Neil Carard has 438 cards in his deck and he gives 10 of them to Jeff. Now, out of these 10 cards, 5 are Bees Balance cards and 5 are other cards. So, the number of Bees Balance cards that Neil has after giving them to Jeff is 5 x 10 = 50. Moreover, there were originally 18 Bees Balance cards in total, so the remaining number of Bees Balance cards with Neil is 18 - 50 = 130.
Response:  Neil has 239 cards in his deck and he gives 10 of them to Jeff. Now, Neil has 229 cards left (239 - 10 = 229). Then, Neil takes 38 more cards from Jeff, so now Neil has 191 cards left (229 - 38 = 191). Therefore, there are 111 cards left with Jeff (38 + 10 = 111).
Response:  Pakistani team won 19 matches and lost 35 matches. So, in total, they played 54 matches (19 + 35). Therefore, at the start of the match, there were 54 kookies available.
Response:  Paco had 28 cookies and gave 7 to his friend. So, he has 21 cookies left (28 - 7 = 21).
Response:  Pakoo first gave away 40 cookies and then bought more than 37 cookies. So, the number of cookies that remained with Pakoo after buying more is: 40 - 37 = 3. Therefore, 3 cookies remained with Pakoo.
Response:  Paku has given 25 cookies to someone and then he bought 5 more cookies from him. So, in total, Paku has 30 cookies (25 + 5).
Response:  Paku bought 13 cookies and gave 2 to someone else. Then he bought 36 more cookies. So, in total, Paku has 36 + 13 = 49 cookies.
Response:  Paku has given 40 cookies to his friends and then he gave 5 more cookies to one of them, so the total number of cookies that Paku gave away is 40 + 5 = 45 cookies. Therefore, Paco got 45 - 13 = 32 cookies from Paku.
Response:  According to the given information, Paku has 17 cookies and gives 14 of them away. So he has 3 remaining (17 - 14 = 3). Now, he meets his friend and gives him 13 of the remaining cookies (3 x 13 = 39). Therefore, after giving these cookies to his friend, Paku is left with 0 cookies (39 - 3 = 0).
Response:  Paku made 12 cookies and gave 16 to his friends. So he has 4 left (12 - 16 = 4). Now, he wants to give some more to his friend who has 21 kookies. So, he will give him 7 kookies (21 - 4 = 17), leaving him with 3 kookies remaining (4 - 7 = 3).
Response:  Pakoo has given 22 medium-sized cookies and 75 small-sized cookies to someone. Then, he took back 15 medium-sized cookies and 54 small-sized cookies from that person. So, the number of medium-sized cookies Paco gave away is 22, and the number of small-sized cookies he gave away is 75 - 15 = 60. Therefore, the total number of cookies Paco gave away is 22 + 60 = 82 cookies.
Response:  Paku has given 9 metals and 6 non-metallic minerals to someone. He received in return 36 metals and 3 non-metallic minerals from that person. So, the number of non-metallic minerals Paco gave is 6 - 3 = 3.
Response:  Pakistani Rupee (PKR) is equal to 0.02 US Dollars (USD). So, 37 PKR = $0.74 and 11 PKR = $0.25. Now, if he spent 5 PKR on something, that means he spent $0.11 (5 x $0.25). And if he earned 2 NKR from somewhere, that means he earned $0.04 (2 x $0.02). Therefore, the total amount of money he has after spending and earning is: $0.11 + $0.04 = $0.15.
Response:  Paku has made 8 medium-sized koeks and 6 small ones. If he has given 20 medium-sized koeks and 34 small ones away, then the number of koeks that he has left is: Number of medium-sized koeks = 8 - 20 = -12 Number of small koeks = 6 - 34 = -28 So, there are -12 medium-sized koeks and -28 small koeks left with Paku.
Response:  Paku has 36 cookies and if he had 37 cookies in his possession earlier, then there would be one less cookie with him now. So, the number of cookies left with Paku is 36 - 1 = 35.
Response:  Paku gave 36 cookies to his friend and then took back 14 of them. So, he has 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22). Now, he gives 10 more cookies to his friend, so now he has 12 cookies left (22 - 10 = 12). Therefore, Paco has given away a total of 14 + 10 = 24 cookies.
Response:  Paku has given 41 cookies to his friend and taken back 9 cookies from him. So, the number of cookies left with Paku is 41 - 9 = 32 cookies. Now, he has given 18 more cookies to his friend, so the total number of cookies that he has given to his friend is 32 + 18 = 50 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left with Paku after giving them all to his friend is 0 cookies.
Response:  Paku has given 6 cookies to his friend and taken back 30 cookies from him. So, the number of cookies that Paku gave to his friend is 6. Now, he has taken back 23 cookies from his friend. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paku gave to his friend minus the number of cookies he took back is 6 - 23 = -17 cookies.
Response:  According to the given information, Paku has made 97 small cakes and 34 medium-sized cakes. He has eaten 15 of them himself and distributed 56 among others. So, the number of cakes that Paco gave away is 56. Therefore, the answer is (D) 56.
Response:  Pakoo has given 26 nuts and 17 cookies to someone. He then took back 14 nuts and 9 cookies from that person. So, the number of nuts that Paco gave away is 26 - 14 = 12 nuts. Similarly, the number of cookies he gave away is 17 - 9 = 8 cookies. Therefore, the number of nuts and cookies that Paco gave away are 12 and 8 respectively.
Response:  Paku has made 39 medium-sized koeks and 6 large ones. If he gives 23 medium-sized koeks and 32 small ones to someone else, how many medium-sized koeks does he have left?
Response:  Paku has cooked 40 meals and 25 naan breads. He has given away 28 naan breads and 15 meals. So, in total, he has given away 28 + 15 = 43 items.
Response:  The person has Rs. 700 in his pocket and he spends Rs. 300 on something. Now he is left with Rs. 400 (Rs. 700 - Rs. 300 = Rs. 400). So, he spent Rs. 300.
Response:  The person has earned $8 and spent $6 leaving him with $2. So, he has $2 left in his wallet.
Response:  The mother gave him Rs. 200 and his father gave him Rs. 400 more. So, in total, he received Rs. 600 from both of them. If he spent Rs. 300, then he has Rs. 300 left with him now.
Response:  The father gave him $8 as an allowance and then he spent $4 of it. So, the amount left with him is $8 - $4 = $4. Therefore, he has $4 to spend on his mother.
Response:  The father gave him $3 for his birthday and he spent $4 more than that. So, the total amount he has is: $3 + ($4 - $1) = $3 + $3 = $6. Therefore, he has $6 in total.
Response:  The father gave him $5 as an allowance and his mother added more $7 to it. So, in total, he received $12 from both of them. If he spent $4 out of that amount, then he has $8 left with him.
Response:  The father gave him $5 as an allowance and his mother added another $2. So, in total, he received $7 from them. If he spent $6, then he has $1 left with him.
Response:  Josh has 9 marbles in his collection and he gave away 3 of them to his friend. So, now he has 9 - 3 = 6 marbles left with him.
Response:  Josh has added 21 marbles to his collection. If he currently has 12 marbles in his collection, then the total number of marbles in his collection is: 21 + 12 = 33 marbles.
Response:  Josh has 19 balls in his basket and he throws away 11 of them. So now he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8). Then he gives 5 more balls to someone else, so now he has 3 balls left (8 - 5 = 3). Therefore, there are 3 balls left with Josh.
"Response:  Josh has 4 marbles in his hand and he throws them randomly into 16 holes. Each hole can hold at most 8 marbles. So, the maximum number of marbles that Josh could have thrown into those holes is:

Maximum number of marbles = Total number of holes x Maximum number of marbles per hole
= 16 x 8
= 128

Therefore, Josh threw at least 128 marbles into those holes."
Response:  Joosh has 7 balls in his basket and gives 8 of them to someone else. Now he has 7 - 8 = 1 ball left in his basket. Then, 10 new marbles come into play and Joosh gets 3 of them. So, now Joosh has 1 + 3 = 4 marbles in his basket.
Response:  Josh has 21 balls in his basket and he has 7 of them. So, there are 21 - 7 = 14 balls left in the basket.
Response:  Joosh has 20 marbles in his collection and gives 2 to Jack. So, he has 18 marbles left. Therefore, there are 18 marbles with Joosh now.
Response:  Joosh has 22 balls in his basket and gives 20 of them to Jack. So, now Joosh has 2 - 20 = 2 balls left in his basket. Therefore, there are 2 marbles left with Joosh.
Response:  Josh has 11 apples and he gave 3 to his friend. So, now Josh has 8 apples left (11 - 3 = 8). Now, if Josh had 19 apples initially, then he must have given away 11 apples (19 - 8 = 11). Therefore, there are 11 apples left with Josh now.
Response:  Josh has 22 marbles in his collection and he gave away 13 of them to his friend. So, now Josh has 9 marbles left (22 - 13 = 9).
Response:  Joosh has 15 marbles in his collection and he gives 9 of them to his friend. So, Joosh has 6 marbles left (15 - 9 = 6). Now, Joosh gives 23 more marbles to his friend, so now Joosh has 0 marbles left (6 - 23 = 0). Therefore, Joosh gave a total of 23 marbles to his friend.
Response:  Joosh has 3 apples in his basket and gives 2 away to someone else. Now he has 1 apple left in his basket. He then takes 5 marbles from another person and adds them to his basket. So, at this point, Joosh has 6 marbles in his basket (including the 1 apple). Therefore, the number of marbles that Joosh gave away is 5.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg is 19 pounds heavier than his father's steroid weight of 4 pounds. So, Mark Zuckerberg's steroid weight would be 19 + 4 = 23 pounds.
"Response:  Mark Zuckerberg and his father have different body weights as follows:
Mark Zuckerberg - 80 pounds (35 kg)
His Father - 200 pounds (90 kg)
So, the difference in their body weight is:
80 pounds - 90 kg = 10 kg
Therefore, the difference in their body weight is 10 kilograms or 22 pounds."
"Response:  We know that Marko's father has a stutter of 20 pounds and his own stutter is 17 pounds less than his father's. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Marko's stutter = Father's stutter - (Father's stutter - Marko's father's stutter)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Marko's stutter = 20 - (17 - x)
where x is the weight of Marko's father.
Now, solving for 'x', we get:
x = 20 + 17 = 37
So, Marko's father weighs 37 pounds."
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg is 32 years old and his father's name is Edward Zuckerberg. So, we can assume that Edward Zuckerberg is also 32 years old as of now (considering he is still alive). Now, let's calculate the weight difference between Mark Zuckerberg and his father. If Mark Zuckerberg weighs 8 pounds, then his father must have weighed 32 pounds x 8 = 256 pounds at some point in time.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have 24 pounds of steroids. They divided them equally among themselves to weigh 9 pounds each. So, Mark Zuckerberg's weight with steroids is 9/2 = 4.5 pounds.
Response:  Marko and his father had 36 pounds of steroids between them before they were caught. After that, Marko's father gave up 8 pounds of steroids. So, Marko now has 12 pounds of steroids. The weight of Marko's father's stash was originally 36 pounds, so it is reduced to 28 pounds (36 - 8) after he gives up some.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg and his parents went to China for 22 pounds of sterilized rice each. Then they returned home with more than 30 pounds of sterilized rice. So, Mark Zuckerberg's father had 36 pounds of sterilized rice in total. Therefore, the answer is 36 pounds.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg is 15 pounds heavier than his father. So, if Mark Zuckerberg's weight is x pounds, then his father's weight would be x + 15 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Mark Zuckerberg's father is 37 pounds minus 15 pounds, which equals 22 pounds.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg is 30 years old and his father's name is also Stuart. So, if Mark Zuckerberg has a weight of 80 pounds (which is approximately equal to 36 kg), then his father's weight would be 54 pounds (approximately equal to 24 kg) less than that, which is 80 - 54 = 26 kg. Therefore, Mark Zuckerberg's father weighs around 26 kg or 57 lbs.
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg's weight is 10 pounds (as given in the question). If his father's stomach had a capacity of 26 pounds (which is the opposite of what was given), then the amount of food that could fit inside Mark Zuckerberg's father's stomach would be: Capacity of stomach = 26 pounds Weight of Mark Zuckerberg = 10 pounds Amount of food that can fit = Capacity of stomach / Weight of person = 26 pounds / 10 pounds = 2.6 times or 260% more than the normal capacity. Therefore, if Mark Zuckerberg's father had a stomach with this unusual capacity, he could potentially hold twice as much food as usual!
Response:  Mark Zuckerberg's father is Stephen Zuckerberg and he has an IQ of 11 points. If Mark Zuckerberg's IQ was 30 points higher than his father's IQ, then what would be the current value of Mark Zuckerberg's IQ?  Solution:  To find out how much higher Mark Zuckerberg's IQ is compared to his father's IQ, we need to subtract the difference between their IQ scores from each other. So if Mark Zuckerberg's IQ score is 30 points higher than his father's IQ score, that means:  IQ Score of Mark Zuckerberg = IQ Score of Father + (30 - 11) = 11 + (29) = 40 Therefore, the current value of Mark Zuckerberg's IQ is 40 points.
Response:  At first, there were two dogs and two babies in the car. Then, one baby died (as mentioned in the question). So, now there are 9 babies left in the car.
Response:  We have 26 babies in total (including both groups). Now, we have added another 38 babies to Group B. So, the total number of babies in Group B is now: 26 + 38 = 64 babies. Therefore, there are 64 babies in total including both groups.
Response:  We have 41 babies in total and we want to know how many of them are crying. So, let's divide the number of babies by 2 (as there are two adults). Therefore, the number of babies crying is: 41 / 2 = 20.5 babies. Since you cannot have a fraction of a baby crying, the final answer is 20 babies crying.
Response:  We have 43 children in total and we want to send 21 of them to school. So, how many will be left behind?  Therefore, there are 21 children who will not go to school.
"Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Now, 18 of them got off the bus. So, the number of children who are still in the bus is:

Number of children still in the bus = Total number of children - Number of children who got off the bus
= 41 - 18
= 23

Therefore, there are 23 children still in the bus."
Response:  We have 21 children and we want to divide them equally among 4 boats. So, each boat will get 5 children (21 / 4 = 5). Now, let's assume that 16 of these children are already in one boat, so there are 5 children left over. Therefore, 5 children will be in another boat.
Response:  We have 5 boys and 2 girls in our group. If we divide them equally among 63 boxes, each box will contain 10 people (including both boys and girls). So, out of these 10 people, 7 are boys (including all 5 original boys) and 3 are girls (including one of the two original girls). Therefore, 7/14 = 0.5 (or 1/2) of the people in each box are boys, and 3/14 = 0.21 (or 1/5) are girls.
Response:  We have 36 babies in total (including both groups).  Out of them, 12 babies are in Group A and 24 babies are in Group B. Now, we need to find out how many babies from Group B will be transferred to Group A. Since there are 68 babies in Group B, and we want to transfer 12 babies to Group A, we can do so by dividing 68 by 5 (since each group has 5 babies). So, 68 / 5 = 13.6. Therefore, 13 babies from Group B will be transferred to Group A.
Response:  We have 22 boys in total and each boy has 40 sweets. So, we have a total of 880 sweets (22 x 40). Now, out of these 880 sweets, 16 boys are left with nothing (since they had no sweets to begin with). Therefore, the number of sweets that the remaining 16 boys got is equal to the total number of sweets minus the number of sweets that the first 22 boys got. In other words, the remaining 16 boys got 880 - 22 x 40 = 880 - 88 = 792 sweets.
Response:  We have 28 babies in total (including both groups).  Out of them, 16 babies are in Group A and 12 babies are in Group B.  Now, we need to find out how many babies from each group are not present in the other group.  From Group A, 4 babies are not present in Group B (since there are only 12 babies in Group B).  Similarly, from Group B, 4 babies are not present in Group A (since there are only 16 babies in Group A).  Therefore, the number of babies who are not present in either group is 4 + 4 = 8.
Response:  We have 23 boys in a class and we need to divide them equally among 4 teachers. So each teacher will get 5.75 boys (23/4). Now, out of these 5.75 boys, 8 are already with us, so the remaining 4.75 boys will be distributed among the other 3 teachers. Therefore, each teacher will get 1.575 boys (4.75/3).
Response:  If Becker made 133 cakes and gave 51 to Inam, then he had 82 cakes left (133 - 51 = 82). Now, if each cake requires 40 minutes to bake, then the total time taken to bake all 82 cakes is: Time taken = Number of cakes x Time per cake = 82 x 40/60 = 410 minutes.
Response:  Becker made 54 cookies and gave some to his friends. If he has 13 cookies left now, then he must have given away x cookies, where x is the number of cookies Becker gave away. So, the number of cookies Becker gave away is 54 - 13 = 41. Therefore, Becker gave away 41 cookies.
Response:  Becker made 145 cakes and currently has 72 left. To find out how many he made initially, we can divide the total number of cakes (145) by the current number of cakes available (72). So, Becker made 145 / 72 = 19 initial cakes.
Response:  If Becker made 155 cakes and sold them for $2 each, he earned total revenue of $310 ($155 x 2). Now, if his friend bought 140 cakes from him at the same price, Becker would have $460 left after the sale ($310 + $150 = $460).
Response:  Becker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them at Rs. 5 each. So he earned Rs. 525 from selling those cakes (105 x Rs. 5). Now, he has 170 cakes left with him. Therefore, the number of cakes Becker still has is: 170 - 105 = 65 cakes.
"Response: 
Becker made 13 cakes and sold them for $91 each. He then bought 154 more cakes at $0.60 per cake. How many cakes did Becker buy in total?
To find out how many cakes Becker bought in total, we need to add the number of cakes he bought initially with the number of cakes he bought later.
Initially, Becker made 13 cakes and sold them for $91 each, so he earned $1123 ($91 x 13). Then, he bought 154 additional cakes at $0.60 per cake, which cost him $87.20 ($0.60 x 154). Therefore, the total amount Becker spent on buying cakes is $1123 + $87.20 = $1210.20.
So, Becker bought a total of 13 + 154 = 167 cakes."
Response:  Becker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them at Rs. 50 per piece. He also bought 31 more cakes for Rs. 40 each. So, he spent a total of Rs. (78 x 50) + (31 x 40) = Rs. 3900 + Rs. 1240 = Rs. 5140. Therefore, Becker spent a total of Rs. 5140 to buy 31 additional cakes.
Response:  Initially, Bakr had 110 cookies and gave away 75 of them. So, he has 110 - 75 = 35 cookies left with him now.
Response:  Initially, Bakr had 144 cakes and he distributed 71 of them among his friends. So, he was left with 73 cakes (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made additional 111 cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes that Bakr has now is: 73 + 111 = 184 cakes.
Response:  If Becker made 149 cakes and 91 pies, then he has a total of 230 items (149 + 91 = 230). Now, if he gives away 10 cakes and 90 pies, he will have 220 items left (230 - 10 - 90 = 220). So, there are 220 items left with Becker.
Response:  If Becker has 7 cakes and 148 pets, he can make 15 cakes and 103 pets if he wants to give some away. So, in total, Becker will have 21 (7 + 15) cakes and 241 (148 + 103) pets.
Response:  If Becker has 126 cookies and he gives 48 to his friend, then he is left with how many cookies?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies given away from the total number of cookies he had. So, the answer is:  Becker has 126 - 48 = 78 cookies left after giving some to his friend.
Response:  If Becker has 19 cakes and he gives 7 of them to his friend, then he has 19 - 7 = 12 cakes left.  Now, if he gives 88 pieces of pie to his friend, then he has 12 + 88 = 100 pieces of food in total (cakes + pies). So, Becker gave away 70 pieces of food (12 cakes x 5 pieces per cake = 60 + 18 pies).
Response:  If Becker made 157 cookies and 169 pies, then he has a total of 326 baked goods (157 + 169 = 326). Now, if he sold 158 cookies and 147 pies, then he has a remaining amount of 326 - (158 + 147) = 326 - 295 = 31 baked goods left. So, Becker sold 31 more baked goods than he had initially.
Response:  If Becker has 54 cookies and he gives 143 to Peter, then Becker has 92 cookies left (54 - 143 = 92). Now, if Becker had 68 cookies before giving any to Peter, then after giving 143 to Peter, Becker will have 92 + 68 = 260 cookies in total.
Response:  If Becker had 44 cookies and he gave 4 to his friend earlier, then he has 40 cookies left (44 - 4 = 40). Now, if he wanted to give 6 more cookies to his friend, he would have given away all of his remaining cookies (40 + 6 = 46), so now he has no cookies left (40 - 46 = -26). Therefore, the correct answer is -26.
Response:  If Becker made $8 in cakes and if he could have made $40 in total, then he must have sold $40 - $8 = $32 worth of cakes. So, Becker sold 32 / 4 = 8 kikes of cakes.
Response:  If Becker's friend had bought 137 cookies and if he could have made 169 cookies at first, then there would be a difference of 32 cookies (169 - 137 = 32). So, now Becker has 32 more cookies than his friend.
"Response: 
Becker made 173 cookies and sold 103 of them at Rs. 5 each. He also gave away 86 cookies for free. Now, let's calculate how many cookies Becker has left with him after all these transactions.
Total number of cookies Becker had = Number of cookies he made + Number of cookies he sold - Number of cookies he gave away
= 173 + 103 - 86
= 94 cookies
So, Becker has 94 cookies left with him now."
Response:  Becker made 99 cookies and sold them for $167 each. He also bought 89 cookies from someone else at a price of $0.50 per cookie. So, if he had to buy all the remaining cookies himself, how many would he have to buy? We know that the total number of cookies he needs is equal to the number of cookies he sold minus the number of cookies he already has (from buying). Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Number of cookies Becker needs = Total revenue - Total cost = $167 x 99 = $16,433 - $89 = $15,544 cookies Now, since he cannot buy whole cookies, let's divide this amount by the cost per cookie to get the approximate number of cookies he needs: Approximate number of cookies Becker needs = Total revenue / Cost per cookie = $15,544 / $0.50 = 31,088 cookies
"Response: 
Becker made 8 cakes and sold them for $139 each. He also bought 145 cakes at a cost of $145 per cake. How many more cakes did Becker buy than he sold?
Let X be the number of cakes Becker bought. Since he sold 8 cakes, we can write:
X - 8 = Number of cakes Becker bought
Now, let Y be the number of cakes Becker sold. We know that he sold 8 cakes, so Y = 8.
So, the difference between the number of cakes Becker bought (X) and the number of cakes he sold (Y) is:
X - Y = 145 - 8 = 137
Therefore, Becker bought 137 more cakes than he sold."
Response:  Initially, Becker had 62 cookies and then he made more 149 cookies. He gave away 144 of them. So, now Becker has how many cookies?  Solution:  Total number of cookies = Initial cookies + New cookies - Cookies given away = 62 + 149 - 144 = 73 cookies. Therefore, Becker currently has 73 cookies.
Response:  Becker made 81 cookies at first and then added more to make 92 in total. He gave away 46 of them. So, he has X number of cookies left, where X = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies given away. In this case, X = 92 - 46 = 46. Therefore, Becker has 46 cookies left.
Response:  According to the given information, Becker has made 61 cakes and 167 cookies. If he had sold 108 cakes and 44 pastries, then he would have 255 items left (61 + 167 - 108 - 44 = 255). So, there are 255 items left with Becker.
Response:  Becker made 56 posts and 124 cakes. If he had 104 cakes and 29 posts left after giving some away, then he has 37 more posts than cakes (104 - 29 = 75). So, Becker now has 37 + 56 = 93 posts in total.
Response:  If Becker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes, then he has a total of 136 items (52 + 84).  If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, then he has 196 items left (102 + 94). So, Becker made 60 more cakes than pastries (94 - 52 = 60).
Response:  If Becker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes, then he has a total of 145 items (134 + 11 = 145). Now, if he sold 140 cookies and 92 pies, he would have 145 - 140 = 15 items left (pastries or cakes). So, Becker made 15 more pastries or cakes than he sold.
Response:  If Becker had 14 cakes and 153 pastries to sell, he could have sold 8 pastries and 97 cookies if he wanted to make a profit of $200. So, in total, Becker would have made $200 x 8 = $1600 from selling pastries and $200 x 97 = $1940 from selling cookies, for a grand total of $1600 + $1940 = $3540.
Response:  If Becker has 43 cookies and 114 peppers, he can make 154 pieces of candy (43 cookies x 3 peppers per cookie) and 78 candies (114 peppers / 2 peppers per candy). So, Becker has made 86 more candies than he had initially (154 - 78 = 86).
Response:  If there are 22 nets in total and each net has 140 holes, then the total number of holes is: 22 x 140 = 3080 holes. So, the correct answer is 3080.
Response:  If there are 106 nuts in total and each nut has 64 kernels, then we have to divide 106 by 64 to find out how many babies will be born. So, the answer is: 106 / 64 = 1.67 babies per nut.
Response:  According to the given information, Kylie has 91 nail polish colors in her collection and she gave away 9 of them. So, the number of nail polishes left with Kylie is 91 - 9 = 82. Now, if we assume that Kylie still has 82 nail polishes in her collection after giving away 9, then the total number of nail polishes she had initially would be 82 + 9 = 91. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 91.
Response:  We have 20 nuts and 70 sunflower seeds. To make 12 nut clusters of equal size, we need to distribute them fairly among themselves. One cluster requires 5 nuts (since there are 5 nuts in each group). So, to make 12 clusters, we will require 5 x 12 = 60 nuts. Since we started with 20 nuts, this means that after making these clusters, we will be left with 20 - 60 = -40 nuts. Therefore, the number of nuts required to make 12 clusters is -40.
Response:  We have been given that there are 46 nets in total and each net contains 132 balls. Now we need to find out how many balls will be required for one dooor (which is equal to 31 nets). So, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of balls = Number of nets x Number of balls in each net Total number of balls = 46 x 132 = 5872 Balls Therefore, we require 5872 balls to make one door.
Response: 80 x 5 = 400 minutes are required to complete 31 games. So, if he takes 4 hours to play each game, then he will need (400/4) = 100 hours to finish all 31 games. Therefore, the number of days it would take him to finish all 31 games is (100/24) = 4 days.
Response:  We have been given that there are 52 blocks in total and we need to find out how many blocks are left after 38 blocks are used. So, let's subtract 38 from 52: 52 - 38 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 blocks remaining.
Response:  We have 97 blocks and we want to use them to make a tower. If we have 72 remaining blocks after making the tower, then we used how many blocks for the tower? So, the answer is 97 - 72 = 25 blocks were used to make the tower.
Response:  We know that there are 79 blocks in total and Renault has 14 blocks to make one car. So, the number of cars Renault can make with these 79 blocks is:  Number of cars = Total blocks / Number of blocks required for one car = 79 / 14 = 5.6 (approximately) Therefore, out of 79 blocks, Renault can make approximately 5.6 cars.
Response:  The total number of blocks is 58. To build one tower, he needs 27 blocks and to build another house, he needs 53 blocks. So, in total, he has used 84 blocks (27 + 53).
Response:  The person has 37 blocks and wants to use them to build either one tower or three houses. If he uses all 33 blocks for building a tower, then he will have 4 blocks left over (33 - 4 = 29). So, he can build at most 29 houses with the remaining 13 blocks. Therefore, the number of houses he could build is 29.
Response:  The person has 86 blocks and wants to use them to build either a tower or a house. If he uses 79 blocks for the tower, then he will have 82 blocks left over to build the house. So, the number of blocks used to build the house is 82.
Response:  We know that Renault has made 36 blocks for one car. If there are 59 blocks in total, then we can deduce that 23 blocks (59 - 36 = 23) are left over after making one car. Therefore, 23 blocks are remaining.
Response:  The person has 95 blocks and wants to use them to build two houses of different sizes. One house requires 20 blocks and the other requires 50 blocks. So, the number of blocks used for each house is:  House with 20 blocks = 95 / 20 = 4.75 houses House with 50 blocks = 95 / 50 = 1.87 houses Therefore, the person could have built 4.75 + 1.87 = 6.62 houses using all 95 blocks.
Response:  The person has 90 blocks and wants to use them to build a house for himself. He can use 89 blocks to build the house and still have one block left over. Then he decides to use 63 blocks to build a tower. So, in total, he used 152 blocks (89 + 63) to build both the house and the tower.
"Response:  If there are 20 books in total and we have read 5 so far, then the number of books left to read is:

$ 20 - 5 = 15 $

So, we have read 5 out of 15 books."
Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the Pagal Suli School series. If we have read 8 of them so far, then the number of remaining books is: 13 - 8 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 books left to read in the Pagal Suli School series.
"Response:  If you have read 22 books and watched 10 movies in the ""Pagal Biewaqof"" series, then you have already consumed 32 hours of content (22 x 7 = 154 minutes per book + 10 x 120 minutes per movie).  Therefore, if you want to consume more content from that series, you will need at least another 32 hours or 154 minutes (since you have already consumed 32 hours). So, the total time required to watch all 22 books and 10 movies in the ""Pagal Biewaqof"" series is 47 hours or 154 minutes (32 hours + 154 minutes)."
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series. If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still have 4 movies to watch from the series. So, the answer is 4 movies.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the ""Pagal Biewa School"" series. If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then the number of books left to read is: 19 - 19 = 0 books left to read. Similarly, the number of movies left to watch is: 13 - 13 = 0 movies left to watch. Therefore, the total number of books and movies left to complete the ""Pagal Biewa School"" series is 0 + 0 = 0."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the ""Pagal Biewaqof School"" series. If we have read 19 books and watched 61 movies from this series, then the number of movies left to watch is: 61 - 19 = 42 movies. Therefore, there are 42 movies remaining in the ""Pagal Biewaqof School"" series for us to watch."
"Response:  We have been given 10 books and 11 movies to compare in the ""Pagal Biewaqof"" series. If we have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then we can calculate the number of books we have read as follows: Number of books read = Total number of books - Number of books already read = 10 - 13 = -3 books So, we have not read any of the 10 books mentioned in the question. Similarly, if we have watched 12 movies and there are 11 movies to compare in the ""Pagal Biewaqof"" series, then we can calculate the number of movies we have watched as follows: Number of movies watched = Total number of movies - Number of movies already watched = 11 - 12 = -1 movie So, we have not watched any of the 11 movies mentioned in the question."
"Response:  We have 11 books and 17 movies in total. If we read 7 books and watch 21 movies, then the number of movies watched will be:

21 - 7 = 14

So, out of the 11 books, if we read 7, then the remaining 4 books are left. Therefore, the number of movies watched is 14."
Response:  If you have read all 8 books in the Pagal Suulli Series, then you have already completed 8/14 of the series. So, to complete the remaining 6 books, you need to read another 6/14 = 0.42 (or approximately 42%) of the series. Therefore, if you want to finish reading the entire Pagal Suulli Series, you still need to read 6/14 or approximately 42% more books.
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different movies and 19 books in the ""Pagal Biewaqof School"" series. If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies, then you still need to read 58 books (62 - 4 = 58) of this series."
"Response:  We have been given 8 movies and 21 books to choose from in the ""Pagal Biewa School"" series. If we have read 20 books and watched 4 movies, then we still have 1 book left to read and 3 movies left to watch. So, the number of movies we can watch now is 3."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in the ""Pagal Biew Qouf School"" series. If we have watched 11 books and 40 movies, then the number of books left to watch is:  Number of books = Total number of books - Number of books already watched = 15 - 11 = 4 So, there are 4 books left to watch in the ""Pagal Biew Qouf School"" series if we have watched 11 books and 40 movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 books and 11 series in the ""Pagal Biewaqof School"" category. If we have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, then the number of movies left to watch is: 63 - 13 = 50 movies. So, the number of movies left to watch after reading 13 books from the ""Pagal Biewaqof School"" category is 50."
Response:  We are given that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series 'Pagal Biewaqof School'. If we have watched 14 movies and read 19 books, then we have watched more than half of the movies (i.e., 14/2 = >5). Similarly, if we have read more than half of the books (i.e., 19/3 = >6), then we have read at least 6 books from the series. Therefore, the number of books we have read from the series is between 6 and 10, inclusive. So, the answer is 7 to 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series. If we have read 19 movies and 16 books, then the number of movies we have not seen is:

Movies not seen = Total movies - Number of movies watched = 5 - 19 = -14

So, we have not seen 14 movies in the series."
Response:  Arkad has already given 7 tickets to Dev. If there are still 2 tickets left with Arkad, then he can sell those remaining tickets to Dev as well. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  The Devi has taken 12 ticks from the game and sold them for Rs. 10 each. Now she has Rs. 120 in her hand. If she still has 14 ticks left with her, then she must have earned Rs. 1680 (14 x Rs. 120) from selling those remaining ticks. Therefore, the correct answer is Rs. 1680.
Response:  Arkad is said to have bought 18 tickets and won 5 of them. So he has won a total of 5 x $10 = $50. Now, there are 11 more tickets left in the deck. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Arkad has after buying all these tickets is: $50 + ($10 x 11) = $50 + $110 = $160.
Response:  If the dog has won 19 tickets in total and it has sold 12 of them, then it has earned $12 x 19 = $218. Now, if it has sold 7 more tickets after that, then it has earned an additional $7 x 19 = $153. So, in total, the dog has earned $218 + $153 = $371.
Response:  If the gaming center owner had earned $13 per ticket sold and he had sold 13 tickets in total, then his earnings would be: $13 x 13 = $169. Now, if he had bought 8 more tickets for $20 each, his additional cost would be: $20 x 8 = $160. So, his new total earnings after buying those extra tickets would be: $169 + $160 = $329. Therefore, the number of tickets he could have sold to make up for the loss is: $329 / $13 = 25 tickets.
"Response:  According to the question, the dog ran 14 miles in one direction and then turned around and ran back for 2 miles. So, the total distance traveled by the dog is:

Distance = Distance run in one direction + Distance run backward
= 14 miles + 2 miles
= 16 miles

Therefore, there are 16 miles left of the dog's journey."
"Response:  According to the question, Helen planted 14 trees in her backyard after cutting down 9 trees. Now, we need to find out how many trees grew from those seeds that were left behind after cutting down the 9 trees. So, let's assume that each seed can grow into one tree. Therefore, the number of trees grown from those seeds is:

Number of trees = Number of seeds x Growth rate (i.e., probability of a seed growing into a tree)
= 9 seeds x 0.5 (assuming 50% growth rate)
= 4.5 trees
So, there are approximately 4.5 trees that grew from the seeds left behind after cutting down the 9 trees."
Response:  According to the question, Heli flew over her house and saw that there were 13 trees in front of it. After flying for 6 minutes, she reached another point. From this point, how many trees did she see?  We know that Heli flew for 6 minutes after reaching the second point, so during these 6 minutes, she must have flown a distance equal to half of the diameter of each tree. Since the radius of each tree is $ \frac{1}{2} \text {m} $, we can calculate the distance traveled by Heli as follows: $$ Distance = \pi \times Radius \times Time $$ Substituting the values given in the question, we get: $$ Distance = \pi \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \text{m} \right) \times 6 \text{minutes} = 90 \text{m} $$ So, during the 6-minute flight, Heli saw 90 trees.
Response:  According to the given information, Heidi had planted 20 trees in her backyard and then after 4 years, she had dug up 3 of them. So, the number of trees that remained after 4 years is: 20 - 3 = 17 trees. Therefore, there were 17 trees left in Heidi's backyard after 4 years.
Response:  Heeli had 5 trees in her backyard before the storm. If there were 12 trees left after the storm, and she planted 3 more trees, then the total number of trees she has now is: Total Number of Trees = Number of Trees Before Storm + Number of Trees Planted After Storm - Number of Trees Lost During Storm Total Number of Trees = 5 + 3 - 12 = 7 Therefore, Heeli has 7 trees in her backyard now.
Response:  Heeli had 5 trees in her backyard initially and then planted another 10 trees after that. So, she has a total of 15 trees now.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 trees in the first half of the field belonging to the toffee maker (i.e., 3 x 1/2 = 1.5 trees). After that, 2 more trees grew in the second half of the field (i.e., 2 x 1/2 = 0.5 trees). So, in total, there are 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 trees left with the toffee maker.
Response:  The tree fell after 13 years of its plantation. If it had grown 3 trees in the first year itself, then how many trees would have grown in total? We know that one tree grows in every 3 years, so if 3 trees grew in the first year, then 9 trees will grow in the next 12 years (i.e., from the second to the thirteenth year). Therefore, the total number of trees that grew is: 3 + 9 = 12 trees. So, 12 trees grew in total.
Response:  The toffee was divided into two equal parts after being heated for 5 minutes each. If it had been heated for 11 minutes in total, then there would have been 6 droughts (3 + 3) that grew during this time. So, out of these 6 droughts, 4 would have grown and reached the surface while the other 2 would still be inside the toffee. Therefore, the number of droughts that grew and reached the surface is 4.
"Response:  If there are 66 thalwegs in total and each thalweg has 28 sandbanks, then the number of sandbanks is:

66 x 28 = 1744

So, there are 1744 sandbanks in total."
Response:  The person has been watching these videos for 8 hours straight, and they have 24 hours in a day. So, to find out how many days it would take them to watch all of these videos, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of hours in a day: 8 hours / 24 hours = 0.33 days (or approximately 1.5 days) Therefore, it would take this person approximately 1.5 days to watch all of these videos if they continue to watch them non-stop without any breaks.
Response:  If he has been watching these videos for 4 days straight without any break, then in total, he must have watched 4 x 24 = 96 hours of videos. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes as follows: 96 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 5760 minutes. Therefore, he has watched 5760 minutes of videos non-stop for 4 days.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 38 stars in each of the 10 constellations, and there are 10 constellations in total. Therefore, the total number of stars is:

38 x 10 = 380 stars

Now, we need to calculate how many days it takes for the sun to move from one constellation to another. The passage states that the sun moves through each constellation in 42 days. So, the total time taken by the sun to complete one cycle of all 12 constellations is:

42 x 12 = 504 days

Therefore, after 504 days, the sun will be back in its original position in the same constellation where it started."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 66 thalwegs in total and each thalweg has 25 sandbanks. So, the total number of sandbanks is: 66 x 25 = 1600 sandbanks. Now, we need to calculate how many sandbanks will be left after 87 days. To do this, we need to divide the total number of sandbanks by the time period (in days): 1600 / 87 = 18 sandbanks per day. Therefore, after 87 days, there will be 18 x 87 = 1594 sandbanks remaining.
Response:  We know that there are 8 thalves in total and each thalve has 35 santris inside it. So, the total number of santris = 8 x 35 = 280 santris. Now, we need to find out how many santris are in one thalve. To do this, we divide the total number of santris by the number of thalves, which is 8. Therefore, the number of santris in one thalve = Total number of santris / Number of thalves = 280 santris / 8 = 35 santris per thalve.
Response:  We know that there are 16 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is: 16 x 24 = 384 hours. Now, we need to convert this value from hours to seconds. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so: 384 hours x 3600 seconds/hour = 149,760 seconds. Therefore, the correct answer is: 149,760 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are 67 thalwegs in total and each thalweg has 12 sandbanks. So, the number of sandbanks is 67 x 12 = 804 sandbanks. Now, we need to find out how many catkins are present in each sandbank. According to the passage, each sandbank contains 35 catkins. Therefore, the total number of catkins present in all 804 sandbanks is 804 x 35 = 28,160 catkins.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 74 days in a year and out of those, 71 days have passed since the person started working. So, the number of days left is 3 (74 - 71 = 3). Now, if we calculate the number of hours in a day, there are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, the total number of hours left is 3 x 24 = 72 hours.
Response:  If there are 76 thalwegs in total and each thalweg has 64 cattees, then the total number of cattees is: 76 x 64 = 4800 cattees. So, if there are 50 thalwegs in each row, then the total number of cattees in one row is: 4800 / 50 = 96 cattees per row.
Response:  According to the given information, the person has been observing the sun for 28 days and nights continuously without any break. Then, they have observed the moon for another 52 days and nights continuously without any break. So, in total, the person has observed both the sun and the moon for 80 days and nights (28 + 52). Now, if we assume that each day is equal to 24 hours, then the total number of hours the person has observed the sun and the moon would be: 80 days x 24 hours/day = 1920 hours.
Response:  According to the given information, the total number of sutures in one cycle is 82 and the number of days in that cycle is 25 days. Now, we need to calculate how many sutures will be present after each day of the cycle. To do this, we divide the total number of sutures (82) by the number of days in the cycle (25): 82 / 25 = 3.28 sutures per day So, at the end of 25 days, there will be approximately 3.28 x 25 = 79.5 sutures left in the cat's body.
Response:  If he has taken 31 days to complete 45 days of work, then he must have worked for 14 days without taking any break (since there are 7 days in a week). So, during these 14 days, he must have completed 14/7 = 2 days worth of work per day. Therefore, he has completed 2 x 14 = 28 days worth of work in total.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 44 pkgs of rice and 25 pkgs of lentils. So, in total, there are 69 packages (44 + 25). Now, let's calculate the number of days these packets will last if they are consumed equally among all the people every day. We know that each package contains 10 kg of rice or lentils, so we need to divide the total weight by the number of days it will last. For rice, the weight is 10 kg x 44 = 440 kg, and for lentils, it is 10 kg x 25 = 250 kg. Therefore, the number of days these packets will last can be calculated as follows: Rice: 440 kg / 30 days = 14.67 days per packet Lentils: 250 kg / 30 days = 8.33 days per packet Based on this calculation, it appears that the packets of rice will last approximately 14.67 days, while the packets of lentils will last approximately 8.33 days.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 5 thalwals in total and out of them, 3 are empty (0 thalwals). So, the number of non-empty thalwes is 5 - 3 = 2. Now, we need to find out how many days these two non-empty thalwes have been filled with water. The first thalwa has been filled for 74 days, and the second one has not been filled yet (0 days). Therefore, the answer is 2 x 74 = 148 days.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 54 trees in total and each tree grows for 18 years. So, if we calculate the number of days taken by each tree to grow, it will be: Number of days = Total number of trees x Time taken by each tree to grow = 54 x 18 = 972 days Now, let's convert this value from days to months: Months = Days / 30 = 972 / 30 = 32.4 months Therefore, each tree takes approximately 32.4 months (or around 2.7 years) to grow from seedling to maturity.
Response:  According to the given information, it is known that the person has taken 56 seeds and divided them into 14 days. Now, if he had taken these seeds for 14 days continuously without taking any break, then the number of seeds he would have consumed per day can be calculated as follows: Number of seeds consumed per day = Total number of seeds / Number of days = 56 seeds / 14 days = 4 seeds per day Therefore, the person would have consumed 4 seeds per day during those 14 days.
Response:  According to the given information, the person has been watching these videos for 73 days straight without any break. Now, let's calculate how many hours he must have spent watching them in total.  There are 24 hours in a day, so if he watched these videos non-stop for 73 days, he must have spent: Total hours = Number of days x Number of hours per day  Total hours = 73 x 24 Total hours = 1792 hours  Therefore, the person must have spent around 1792 hours (or approximately 76 days) watching these videos non-stop.
Response:  According to the given information, in 6 days, they have consumed 65 big and 46 small meals. So, if we calculate the average number of meals per day, it will be:  Average no. of meals/day = Total no. of meals / No. of days = 101 (big + small) / 6 = 17 meals/day Now, let's assume that after 6 days, their stomach capacity has increased by half, so their new stomach capacity would be: New stomach capacity = Old stomach capacity x 2 = 65 Big + 46 Small = 111 Meals Now, let's check how many big and small meals they can eat in one day with this new stomach capacity: Big meals = New stomach capacity / 2 = 111 / 2 = 55.5 meals Small meals = New stomach capacity - Big meals = 111 - 55.5 = 55.5 meals Therefore, after 6 days, they can eat approximately 55.5 big meals and 55.5 small meals in a day.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 41 big stars and 86 small stars in total. Now, let's calculate how many days these stars take to change their positions. For the big stars, it takes 41 days to complete one orbit around the center of the galaxy, while for the small stars, it takes 86 days. So, if we add both these values together, we get a total of 127 days (41 + 86). Therefore, the big stars move at a slower pace than the small stars, as they take more time to complete one orbit around the center of the galaxy.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 71 big and small stars in total. Out of these, 49 big stars have been seen for 7 days continuously, while 22 small stars have been seen for 60 days continuously. So, the number of big stars that have not been seen for more than 7 days is: 71 - 49 = 22. Similarly, the number of small stars that have not been seen for more than 60 days is: 22. Therefore, the number of stars that have not been seen for more than 7 days or more than 60 days is: 22 + 22 = 44.
Response:  The length of Giant's bed is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how many square feet are in the bed, we need to multiply its length and width. So, the area of the bed is: Area = Length x Width = 12 x 11 = 132 square feet. Therefore, there are 132 square feet in Giant's bed.
"Response:  We know that Jasi has 7 feet long and 3 feet wide room. If we make it into 14 square feet size, then its length will be:
Length = 14 x Width = 3 = 42 feet
So, the length of Jasi's room is 42 feet."
Response:  We know that the length of Jaseen is 7 feet and he wants to make it into 14 pieces of equal size. So, we need to divide the total length of Jaseen (7 ft) by 14 to find out how long each piece will be. Therefore, the length of each piece of Jaseen will be: 7 ft / 14 = 0.5 ft or 6 inches.
"Response:  The given information is as follows: 
Question: جسی کے کمرے 11 فٹ لمبا اور 15 فٹ چوڑا ہے. اگر اس کے پاس پہلے سے ہی 16 مربع فٹ قالین ہے تو اسے پورے فرش کو ڈھکنے کے لئے اور کتنی قالین کی ضرورت ہے ؟

From the question, we know that Jasi has 11 feet long and 15 feet wide room. If there are 16 square feet of carpet in front of him, then how many square feet of carpet will he need to cover his entire floor?

To find out the area of the room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is: Area = Length x Width.

So, the area of the room is: Area = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet.

Now, if Jasi wants to cover his entire floor with carpet, he will need an additional amount of carpet equal to the area of the room. Therefore, the total number of square feet of carpet needed is: Total = 165 + (Area of Room) = 165 + 165 = 330 square feet."
Response:  We know that there are two large rooms and twelve small rooms in the house. Each large room has four square feet of space, so each one has 4 x 2 = 8 square feet of space. Similarly, each small room has 12 / 3 = 4 square feet of space. Therefore, the total area of all the rooms in the house is: Large rooms: 8 x 2 = 16 square feet Small rooms: 4 x 12 = 48 square feet So, the house needs at least 16 + 48 = 64 square feet of tiles to cover all the rooms.
Response:  If there are 19 feet in length and 18 feet in width of the room, then the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 square feet Now, if there are 20 compartments in the room, we need to divide the total area of the room among them: Total Area = 342 square feet / Number of Compartments = 342 / 20 = 17.1 square feet per compartment Therefore, each compartment requires approximately 17.1 square feet of space.
Response:  The length of the room is 19 feet and the width is 20 feet. To find out how long the room is in feet, we need to multiply its length and width. So, the area of the room = length x width = 19 x 20 = 380 square feet. Therefore, the length of the room is 380 / 12 = 31.67 feet.
Response:  If Jasi has 10 feet and he wants to measure his rooms, then each foot is equal to 0.3 meters (as there are 10 feet in 1 meter). So, if Jasi's room is 5 feet long, it means that his room is 5 x 0.3 = 1.5 meters long.
Response:  If Jasi has 10 feet and he wants to measure his rooms, then each foot is equal to 30 cm (as there are 12 inches in a foot). So, if Jasi's room is 2 feet long, it means that it is 60 cm long (2 x 30 cm = 60 cm).
"Response:  We know that there are 18 feet in one yard and 36 inches in one foot. So, we can calculate the number of inches in 18 yards as follows:

18 yd x 36 in/yd = 672 in
Now, we need to find out how many cubits are required to fill 672 inches. According to the question, each cubit is equal to 4 fingers (or 1 palm) plus 20 fingers (or 5 palms). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of fingers needed to fill 672 inches as follows:

672 in / (4 finger + 20 finger) = 168 finger
So, it takes approximately 168 fingers or 49.5 palms to fill 672 inches."
"Response:  The revenue of each ticket sold is $23 per seat. If there are 230 seats in total, then the total revenue from selling tickets would be:

$23 x 230 = $5,190
So, 230 tickets were sold."
Response:  The revenue of each ticket is $ 50, and there are 3 tickets sold during the time period of 3 hours. Therefore, the total revenue for that time period is:  Total Revenue = Number of Tickets x Price of Each Ticket x Time Period  Total Revenue = 3 x $ 50 x 3 hours = $ 450  So, the price of each ticket is $ 150 ($ 450 / 3 tickets).
Response:  The revenue of each ticket sold is $87. During the Arkansas and Texas cruises, they sold 95 tickets in total. If they sold 47 tickets during the Arkansas cruise, then how much money did they make from selling those tickets? Solution: To find out how much money they made from selling tickets during the Arkansas cruise, we need to multiply the number of tickets sold (47) by the revenue per ticket ($87). Therefore, the amount of money they made from selling tickets during the Arkansas cruise is: $4099 ($87 x 47).
Response:  The revenue of each ticket sold is $ 106. During the Arkansas and Texas games, they sold 242 tickets in total. If they had sold 115 tickets during the Arkansas game, then how many tickets did they sell during the Texas game? Solution: To find out how many tickets were sold during the Texas game, we need to subtract the number of tickets sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of tickets sold. So, the number of tickets sold during the Texas game is: 242 - 115 = 127 tickets. Therefore, they sold 127 tickets during the Texas game.
Response:  The revenue of each ticket sold is $98 per seat. If they sell 163 tickets during the Arkansas game and Texas Tech game separately, then the total revenue from both games will be: Total Revenue = Number of Tickets Sold x Price Per Ticket Total Revenue = 163 x $98 = $15,744 Now, if they sold 89 tickets during the Arkansas game, then the revenue from that game alone would be: Revenue (Arkansas Game) = Number of Tickets Sold x Price Per Ticket Revenue (Arkansas Game) = 89 x $98 = $8,722 So, the difference in revenue between the two games is: Difference in Revenue = Revenue (Texas Tech Game) - Revenue (Arkansas Game) Difference in Revenue = $15,744 - $8,722 = $6,022
"Response:  The revenue of each ticket sold is $78 per seat. If they have sold 186 tickets in total during the Arkansas and Texas games, then the total revenue from these games is:

$78 x 186 = $14,508

Now, if they had sold 172 tickets during the Arkansas game only, the revenue would be:

$78 x 172 = $13,096

So, the difference in revenue between selling all 186 tickets and selling 172 tickets during the Arkansas game is:

$14,508 - $13,096 = $1,412

Therefore, if they had sold 172 tickets during the Arkansas game instead of 186 tickets, they would have earned an additional $1,412 in revenue."
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $62 per day and each Jersey is $99 per day. During the summer season (June to September), they sold 183 bikes and 31 Jerseys. So, their total revenue during this period was: Total Revenue = Number of Bikes x Price per Bike + Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey Total Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99 Total Revenue = $10,753 + $2,899 Total Revenue = $13,652
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $67 and that of each Jersey is $165. During the summer season (June to September), they sold 74 bikes and 156 Jerseys. So, the total amount earned from these sales is: Total Revenue = Number of Bikes x Price of Each Bike + Number of Jerseys x Price of Each Jersey Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 Total Revenue = $4,938 + $259 Total Revenue = $5,197
Response:  The revenue of each t-shirt is $192 and each jersey is $34. So, in total, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys during the summer season. Therefore, the total revenue was: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt + Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey Total Revenue = 157 x $192 + 19 x $34 Total Revenue = $28,604 Now, we need to find out how much one t-shirt costs. To do this, we divide the total revenue by the number of t-shirts sold: Cost of One T-Shirt = Total Revenue / Number of T-Shirts Sold Cost of One T-Shirt = $28,604 / 157 Cost of One T-Shirt = $183.64 So, one t-shirt costs approximately $183.64.
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $86 and each Jersey is $232. During the summer season (254 t-shirts and 43 Jerseys were sold), the total revenue was $21,792 (254 x $86 = $21,792). So, the price of one T-shirt during this season was approximately $86 / 254 = $0.33 per T-shirt. Similarly, the price of one Jersey during this season was approximately $232 / 43 = $5.36 per Jersey.
"Response:  The revenue of each ticket is $51, and there are 130 tickets sold in total. Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling these tickets is:
$51 x 130 = $6,430
So, the profit earned from selling these tickets is:
Profit = Total Revenue - Cost
= $6,430 - (Cost of organizing the event + Ticket printing cost)
We know that the cost of organizing the event was $8 per ticket, so the total cost of organizing the event for all 130 tickets is:
$8 x 130 = $920
Therefore, the profit earned from selling these tickets is:
Profit = $6,430 - $920 = $5,510"
Response:  The revenue of each ticket is Rs. 201 per ticket.  If 217 tickets were sold in total and 14 tickets were sold during the Arcansaas and Teksaas seasons, then we can calculate the total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of tickets sold x Price of each ticket Total Revenue = 217 tickets x Rs. 201 per ticket = Rs. 43,517 (approximately) So, the amount earned from selling tickets is approximately Rs. 43,517.
"Response:  The Revenue Manager at the hotel received $60 per room sold during peak season. If they reduced the price of each room by $10, then...

The number of rooms sold = Total revenue / Price per room
= $60 x 100 (since there is a 10% reduction in price)
= 600 rooms

Therefore, if the Revenue Manager reduced the price of each room by $10, they would have sold 600 rooms."
Response:  The cost of each razor blade is $215. Since there are 5 blades in one pack, we need to divide the total cost by 5 to find out the cost per blade: Cost per blade = Total cost / Number of blades = $215 / 5 = $43 per blade Therefore, the cost of each razor blade is $43.
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $5 per day and that of each ticket is $215 per day. During the summer season (June to September), they sold 20 tickets and during the winter season (December to March), they sold 64 jerseys. So, in total, they earned: Revenue from bikes = 5 days x 20 tickets = $100 Revenue from tickets = 3 months x 64 jerseys = $1920 Total revenue = $1920 + $100 = $1930
Response:  The revenue from each bike is $76 and from each t-shirt is $204. During the summer season, they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 jerseys. So, their total revenue during that period was: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt + Number of Jerseys Sold x Price per Jersey Total Revenue = 158 x $204 + 2 x $76 Total Revenue = $31,920 Now, let me know if you have any other questions!
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $210 and that of each t-shirt is $240. In total, they sold 177 bikes and 23 t-shirts during the summer camp. So, their total revenue was: Total Revenue = Number of Bikes x Price of Each Bike + Number of T-Shirts x Price of Each T-Shirt Total Revenue = 177 x $210 + 23 x $240 Total Revenue = $38,560 Now, we need to find out how much one t-shirt costs in relation to a bike. To do this, we will divide the price of one t-shirt ($240) by the price of one bike ($210): Cost of One T-Shirt / Cost of One Bike = $240 / $210 Cost of One T-Shirt / $210 = 1.1 (approximately) Therefore, one t-shirt costs approximately 1.1 times more than a bike.
Response:  The revenue of each bike is $115 and each t-shirt is $25. So, in total, they sold 113 bikes and 78 t-shirts during the arkansaas and texas trips. Now, to find out how much one t-shirt costs, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of t-shirts sold: Total Revenue = 113 x $115 + 78 x $25 = $9,060 Number of T-Shirts Sold = 78 So, one t-shirt costs approximately $\frac{Total Revenue}{Number of T-Shirts Sold} = \frac{9,060}{78} = $115 Approximately.
Response:  If there are 5 seats in total and each seat has 10 cushions, then the total number of cushions is: 5 x 10 = 50 cushions.
Response:  There are two seats in each of the two cars, so there are 4 seats in total. Since there are 12 people in the first car and 3 people in the second car, we have: Number of seats available = Total number of passengers - Number of passengers who will sit in the same car as the driver (driver + one passenger from each of the other car) = 12 - 3 = 9 seats available for the remaining 7 people to sit. Therefore, 9 people can sit in the two cars combined.
"Response:  If there are 10 rooms in the house and each room has 5 corners (a total of 50 corners), then the number of seats available for sitting is:

Total number of corners = Number of rooms x Number of corners per room
= 10 x 5
= 50

So, there are 50 seats available for sitting in the house."
"Response:  If there are 11 seats in the living room and each seat has 13 cushions, then the total number of cushions in the living room is:

11 x 13 = 143

So, there are 143 cushions in the living room."
Response:  There are 10 people in the house and each person has 6 chairs to sit on. If 11 people want to sit down, then there will be 1 chair left over for each of them. So, the number of chairs available is 10 - (11 x 6) = 40 chairs.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 12 rooms in the house and each room has 14 pieces of furniture. Therefore, the total number of pieces of furniture in the house is:

12 rooms x 14 pieces/room = 168 pieces of furniture

However, as mentioned in the question, there are also 6 additional pieces of furniture that belong to the guests. So, the total number of pieces of furniture in the house for the mahman (hosts) is:

168 + 6 = 174 pieces of furniture

Therefore, the correct answer is 174 pieces of furniture."
Response:  If each person in the group of 14 has to buy 3 things from the market, then how many things will they buy in total?  Number of people = 14 People x Number of items per person = 14 x 3 = 42 Things Total number of things that the group of 14 people will buy from the market is 42.
"Response:  If there are 14 seats in the living room and each seat has a backrest with a height of 60 cm, then the total height of all the backrests will be:

14 x 60 = 840 cm

Now, if we subtract the height of the 9 seats from this total height, we get:

840 - 9 x 60 = 720 cm

So, there are 720 cm (or approximately 2 feet 4 inches) of space between the top of the backrests of the chairs and the ceiling."
"Response:  If Lewis can reduce his monthly expenses by $460 during the five months of summer vacation, then he will have saved a total of:

$460 x 5 = $2300

So, each month, Lewis will save:

$2300 / 5 = $460

Therefore, Lewis will save $460 per month during the five months of summer vacation."
"Response:  Louis has $1216 during his 7-month trip to Europe. If he spends $16 per day, then the number of days he can afford to travel is:

$1216 / $16 = 78 days

So, Louis can afford to travel for 78 days in total."
Response:  Lewis has $216 in his account at the beginning of each month, and he spends $21 every day. Therefore, he has spent a total of $21 \times 702 = $14,344 during the year. So, if he had saved $702 taxes, then he would have $14,344 - $702 = $13,642 left after paying taxes.
"Response:  If Lewis can work for 223 days in a year and earn $1357 per day, then his total income in a year would be:

Total income = Number of working days x Daily wage
= 223 x $1357
= $294,610
Now, if he works for 73 months (which is equal to 6 years), his total income would be:

Total income = Total income per year x Number of years
= $294,610 x 6
= $1,783,660
So, if Lewis works for 73 months, his total income would be $1,783,660."
"Response:  Louis earns $28 per hour during his 1091 hours of work in a year. If he works every day for 7 days a week, then he works for 52 weeks in a year (ignoring leap years). So, his total annual income is:

Annual Income = Hourly Wage x Number of Working Hours/Year
= $28/hour x 1091 hours/year
= $2964
Now, if Louis also does overtime work and earns an additional $939 per week, his total annual income becomes:

Total Annual Income = Overtime Income + Regular Income
= $939/week x Number of Weeks of Overtime Work/Year
+ $2964

Since Louis works for 52 weeks in a year, the number of weeks of overtime work is:

Number of Weeks of Overtime Work = Total Number of Weeks in a Year - Number of Weeks of Regular Work
= 52 weeks - 1091 hours/year / 7 days/week
= 13 weeks
Therefore, Louis's total annual income including overtime work is:

Total Annual Income = $939/week x 13 weeks
+ $2964
= $3803
So, Louis earns around $3803 per year including overtime work."
Response:  Louis has 233 days in his season and spends $403 less than he earned each day. If he spent $49 per day, then during that season, he lost $49 x 233 = $11,567.
"Response:  In one year (1359), there are 365 days in a leap year and 364 days in a non-leap year. So, if we assume that each month has 30 days, then the total number of days in a year is:

Non-leap years: 364 x 30 = 10,920 days
Leap years: 365 x 30 = 10,950 days

Now, let's calculate the average daily income for each month:

Non-leap years: $388 x 10,920 = $407,640,000
Leap years: $388 x 10,950 = $409,350,000

So, the total amount of money earned during these 1359 months is:

Non-leap years: $407,640,000 + $409,350,000 = $816,990,000
Leap years: $409,350,000

Therefore, the average monthly income over these 1359 months is:

Non-leap years: $816,990,000 / 1359 = $603,333 per month
Leap years: $409,350,000 / 1359 = $306,377 per month"
"Response:  The total number of days in the year is 365 (leap years have 366 days). So, if Louis spends $491 every 7 days, he will spend a total of:

$491 x 7 = $3,307 per month
$3,307 x 11 = $35,747 per year

So, after 1181 weeks (or 25 years), Louis will have spent a total of:

$35,747 x 25 = $888,675

Therefore, the amount of money Louis will have after 1181 weeks (or 25 years) is $888,675."
Response:  Lewis has saved $133 per month for 19 years. To calculate how much he has saved in total, we can use the formula: Total Amount = Number of Years x Monthly Savings. So, Total Amount = 19 x 133 = $2571. Therefore, Lewis has saved $2571 during these 19 years.
Response:  If Louis spends $2 per week on each of the 7 days in a fortnight (i.e., every 14 days), then he spends a total of $2 x 7 = $14 per fortnight on these expenses. Now, if he has $178 left after paying all his bills, that means he has $178 - $14 = $164 left for other expenses. So, there are 164/7 = 23 weeks worth of fortnights for which Louis can save money without incurring any expense.
Response:  After drinking water for 1 hour, the person has consumed 8 glasses of water (1 hour x 8 glasses/hour = 8). Now, we need to calculate how much water is left in the bottle after 10 hours. We know that the bottle can hold 2 liters of water and the person has drunk 8 glasses of water in 1 hour, so the amount of water left in the bottle after 1 hour is: 2 liters - 8 glasses = 0.67 liters (since each glass contains 0.2 liters of water). To find out how much water is left in the bottle after 10 hours, we multiply the amount of water left after 1 hour by 10: 0.67 liters x 10 hours = 6.7 liters. Therefore, there are 6.7 liters of water left in the bottle after 10 hours.
Response:  After drinking water for 8 hours, the amount of water in the stomach will be equal to 8 x 0.5 = 4 liters. If Ron is 14 feet tall and each foot contains 0.25 gallons (as per the conversion factor), then the total volume of water in his body can be calculated as follows: Volume of water in Ron's body = Number of gallons in one foot x Total number of feet in height of Ron = 0.25 gallons/foot x 14 feet = 3.5 gallons So, if Panji consumed 4 liters of water after drinking for 8 hours, then the remaining amount of water in his body would be: Remaining water in Panji's body = Initial water in Panji's body - Water consumed = 3.5 gallons - 4 liters = 0.5 gallons
Response:  We know that after drinking water for 8 hours, the concentration of salt in the blood decreases to half its original value. So if we assume that the concentration of salt in the blood was originally 40 grams per liter (which is a reasonable assumption), then after 8 hours, it would be reduced to 20 grams per liter. Now, let's calculate how much water is needed to dilute the blood from 40 g/L to 16 g/L (the concentration at which dehydration occurs). To do this, we can use the formula: Volume of water = Concentration x Initial volume (in liters) / Final concentration (in g/L) Using the values given in the question, we get: Volume of water = 40 g/L x 5 L / 16 g/L = 37.5 L Therefore, approximately 37.5 liters of water are needed to dilute the blood from 40 g/L to 16 g/L and cause dehydration.
Response:  We know that after drinking water for 15 minutes, the person felt thirsty again. So, the amount of water consumed must have been less than what they needed to quench their thirst completely.  Since the person drank 4 glasses of water from the Denver fountain, we can assume that each glass contained approximately 8 ounces (fl oz) of water. Therefore, the total amount of water consumed would be: 4 glasses x 8 fl oz/glass = 32 fl oz or 0.96 liters. Now, let's calculate how much water was left in the bottle after the person had drunk it: Total volume of water in the bottle = Volume of water added to the bottle (from the fountain) - Amount of water consumed = 1 liter - 0.96 liters = 0.04 liters or 4 ounces. So, there were approximately 4 ounces of water left in the bottle after the person had drunk from it.
Response:  We know that after drinking water for 8 hours, the concentration of salt in the blood decreases to half its original value. So if the initial concentration of salt in the blood is 4% (which is the case), then after 8 hours, it will be 2%. Now we need to find out how much salt is present in 1 liter of blood. According to the question, there are 16 grams of salt in 1 liter of blood. Therefore, if we divide the amount of salt in 1 liter of blood by the concentration of salt in the blood, we get: Salt in 1 liter of blood = 16 g / 0.02 = 800 g. So, if the person drank 16 liters of water, the total amount of salt they would have consumed is: Total salt consumption = 800 g x 16 L = 12,800 g.
Response:  The height of the water level in the tank is given as 9 feet more than the depth of the well. So, if the depth of the well is x feet, then the height of the water level in the tank will be 9 + x feet. Now, we are asked to find out how many times the volume of water in the tank exceeds the volume of water in the well. To do this, we need to divide the volume of water in the tank (which is equal to the product of its length, breadth, and height) by the volume of water in the well (which is equal to the product of its depth and width). So, let's calculate these volumes first: Length of the tank = 20 feet Breadth of the tank = 10 feet Height of the water level in the tank = 9 feet + x feet Depth of the well = 6 feet Width of the well = 3 feet Volume of water in the tank = Length × Width × Height = 20 × 10 × (9 + x) = 1800 + 9x cubic feet Volume of water in the well = Depth × Width = 6 × 3 = 18 cubic feet Now, we can see that the volume of water in the tank exceeds the volume of water in the well by 1782 - 18 = 1764 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of times the volume of water in the tank exceeds the volume of water in the well is 1764 / 18 = 99 times.
"Response:  If Baraain has written 34 books and each book contains an average of 20 pages per book, then the total number of pages in all his books is:

34 books x avg pages/book = 768 pages
So there are approximately 768 pages in all of Baraain's books."
"Response:  If Baraain has written 42 books and each book contains an average of 2 chapters, then the total number of chapters written by Baraain is:

42 books x 2 chapters/book = 84 chapters
So, out of these 84 chapters, Baraain has written 42 chapters himself, which means he has written half of them (i.e., 42/84 = 1/2)."
"Response:  According to the given information, Baraain has written 23 books and each book contains an average of 15 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages written by Baraain is:

23 x 15 = 345 pages
Now, out of these 345 pages, 27 are dedicated to his most popular book, leaving us with:

345 - 27 = 318 pages
Therefore, according to the given information, Baraain has written approximately 318 books."
Response:  According to the given information, Baraain has written 9 books and 46 articles. If we want to know how many articles are there in each of his 10 books, then we can divide the total number of articles (46) by the number of books (10). So, the number of articles in each book is: 46 / 10 = 4.6 articles per book.
Response:  According to the given information, Baraain has written 23 books and 61 articles. If we want to know how many of his books or articles are there in each of his 29 categories, then we need to divide the total number of books (23) and articles (61) by 29. So, the number of books or articles in each category will be: Books: 23/29 = 0.79 (approximately 8 books) Articles: 61/29 = 2.10 (approximately 21 articles) Therefore, out of Baraain's 23 books, approximately 8 books are in each of his 29 categories, and out of his 61 articles, approximately 21 articles are in each of his 29 categories.
"Response:  If Baraain has 28 books in total and he wants to distribute them equally among his friends, then each friend will get how many books?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of books (28) by the number of friends (n). So, the equation is:

Number of books per friend = Total number of books / Number of friends
= 28 / n

Since there are 7 friends, we can plug in the value of n = 7 into the equation:

Number of books per friend = 28 / 7
= 4

So, each friend will get 4 books from Baraain."
Response:  According to the given information, Baraain has written 38 books and each book contains two chapters. So, in total, Baraain has written 76 chapters (38 x 2 = 76).
Response:  If we have 10 friends and each friend invites 2 guests, then in total there will be 2 x 10 = 20 people at the party. Now, if any of these 20 people bring their own guests, then the number of people attending the party will increase to 30 (20 + 10). So, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  Kiran has invited 12 friends to his wedding and he has given them Rs. 500 each as a gift. Since there are 3 peons (attendants) in each group of 4 guests, the total number of attendants is 3 x 4 = 12. So, the total number of gifts that Kiran has given is 12 x 500 = Rs. 6,000.
"Response:  Kiran has 10 friends and he wants to give them each a gift card worth Rs. 500. He can buy only 7 gift cards in total, so he will have to choose which 3 of his friends to give smaller gifts to. In this case, if Kiran gives each of his remaining 3 friends a gift card worth Rs. 200, then the total amount spent on gift cards would be:
Rs. 500 x 3 = Rs. 1500
So, the answer is 1500."
Response:  Kiran has invited his friends to his wedding and has given them 14 invitation cards in total. Out of these, he has received 6 RSVPs (replies) back from his friends, which means that they have accepted his invitation. Now, Kiran wants to know how many friends he still needs to invite to fill up all the available seats at his wedding. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of confirmed guests (6) from the total number of invitations sent out (14). So, Kiran still needs to invite 8 more friends to his wedding.
Response:  Kiran has 10 friends and he wants to invite them for his wedding. He can give each friend 2 invitation cards (one for himself and one for his friend). So, in total, Kiran will need 50 invitation cards (10 friends x 2 cards per friend = 50 cards). If Kiran wants to buy additional invitation cards beyond what is required for his 10 friends, then he will need 40 more invitation cards (9 extra friends x 2 cards per friend = 40 cards). Therefore, the total number of invitation cards that Kiran needs to buy is 90 (50 cards for his friends + 40 cards for additional guests).
Response:  Miles has made 12 points in each of the 36 chessboards he has played with. If he has played 36 games altogether, then he has scored 12 x 36 = 432 points overall.
"Response:  Miles has made 3 batches of 81 points each and distributed them among three machines in a combined manner. So, the total number of points distributed among all three machines is:

Total points = Number of points in one batch x Number of batches
= 81 points/batch x 3 batches
= 243 points

Therefore, each machine received:

Number of points per machine = Total points / Number of machines
= 243 points / 3 machines
= 81 points"
Response:  Miles has made 109 puffs in each kite and 82 puffs in each boat. Therefore, he has made a total of 109 x 3 = 327 puffs in all the boats and kites combined. Since there are 79 matches, Miles has made 327 / 79 = 4.15 puffs per match.
Response:  Miles has made 21 points in total and each point is worth 7 pints. So, he has earned 21 x 7 = 147 points altogether.
Response:  The number of points scored by each team in each match is given as follows:  Team A - 91 points, Team B - 82 points, and so on. Since there are 13 matches in total, we can calculate the total number of points scored by each team as follows:  For Team A: Total points = Number of matches x Points per match = 13 x 91 = 1133 points For Team B: Total points = Number of matches x Points per match = 13 x 82 = 1056 points Therefore, Team A scored 1133 points and Team B scored 1056 points.
Response:  There are 4 seats in the heavenly park and 20 people want to go there at the same time. Since each seat can accommodate only one person, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many seats will be left empty. So, 5 seats will be left empty (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  There are 9 people in each cage, and there are 3 cages. So, the total number of people in all three cages is 9 x 3 = 27. If 18 people can fit in one cage at a time, then the maximum number of people who can be accommodated in all three cages together is 27 / 18 = 3.5. Therefore, there are 3.5 cages full of people in the park.
Response:  There are 19 seats in each row of the park, and there are 15 people sitting in each seat. So, the total number of people sitting in one row is 19 x 15 = 285. Now, we have to find out how many rows are there in the park. According to the question, there are 4 rows in the park. Therefore, the total number of people sitting in the park is 4 x 285 = 1140.
Response:  There are 18 seats in the park and each seat can accommodate 3 people. So, total capacity of the park is 18 x 3 = 54 people. Now, if 10 people leave the park, then the remaining capacity will be 54 - 10 = 44 people. Therefore, at any given time, there can be maximum 44 people in the park.
"Response:  There are 6 seats in each coach of the train and there are 14 people in each set. If there are 16 people in total, then we need to divide them equally among the 6 coaches. Therefore, the number of people in each coach is:

16 / 6 = 2.67
So, approximately 2-3 people will be in each coach."
Response:  There are two large sets in the garden - one with 20 small seats and another with 23 big seats. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, while each big seat can accommodate 54 people. Now, we need to find out how many people can be seated altogether in both the sets. To do this, we will multiply the number of small seats by 14 (since each small seat can accommodate 14 people) and then add it to the product of the number of big seats multiplied by 54 (since each big seat can accommodate 54 people). So, the total number of people who can be seated in both the sets is: 20 x 14 = 280 + 23 x 54 = 1226 = 1406 people. Therefore, there can be up to 1406 people seated in both the sets combined.
Response:  There are 3 large seats and 7 small seats in the park. Each large seat can accommodate 16 people, and each small seat can accommodate 12 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can sit in the park is: Large seats x Number per seat = 3 x 16 = 48 Small seats x Number per seat = 7 x 12 = 84 So, there can be up to 84 people sitting in the park at any given time.
Response:  There are 16 people in heaven at one time. Since there are four seats available for each person to sit on, we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit on each seat. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  There are 4 people in heaven and they want to play hide-and-seek. If each person can hide one other person, then there will be 4 x 3 = 12 hiding places. Since there are only 4 people playing, each person can hide two others, so there will be 4/4 = 1 hiding place left over for the last person. Therefore, there are 12 + 1 = 13 hiding places in heaven.
Response:  We have given 7 arrows to each of the 4 pizzas. So, in total we have given 7 x 4 = 28 arrows. Now, if all the 14 slices are filled with cheese, then each slice will have 28 / 14 = 2 cheeses. Therefore, there will be 2 cheeses per slice.
Response:  We have made 10 pizzas in total. Each pizza has two slices. So, we have made 20 slices of pizza altogether.
"Response:  We have made 17 orders in total. In each order, there are 4 pieces of food. So, if we have ordered 25 items in total, then the number of pieces of food in all those orders is:

Number of pieces of food = Total number of orders x Number of pieces per order
= 17 x 4
= 68
Therefore, there are 68 pieces of food in all the orders made by us."
Response:  We have made an order of 9 pizzas. Each pizza has 10 slices, so we have ordered a total of 9 x 10 = 90 slices of pizza. If we are sharing them equally among ourselves, then each person will get 90 / 2 = 45 slices of pizza.
Response:  The mother had 45 apples in her basket and she gave 10 apples to each of her four children. So, the total number of apples given to the children is: 45 x 4 = 180 apples.
Response:  If we have 9 apples and each apple has 45 beads in it, then the total number of beads in all 9 apples is 9 x 45 = 405 beads. Now, if we want to know how many beads are in each apple, we can divide the total number of beads (405) by the number of apples (9). So, the number of beads in each apple is 405 / 9 = 45 beads.
"Response:  We know that the mother plant gave birth to 36 fruits and each fruit had 12 seeds in it. So, the total number of seeds produced by the mother plant is:

36 x 12 = 432 seeds
Now, we are asked how many seeds were added to each fruit. The answer is:

432 / 58 = approximately 7.5 seeds per fruit
So, there were approximately 7.5 seeds added to each of the 58 fruits."
"Response:  The mother planted 55 seeds and each seed produced 3 plants (as mentioned in the problem). So, the total number of plants grown from those seeds is:

55 x 3 = 165 plants
Now, out of these 165 plants, 60 were fully grown (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, the number of partially grown plants is:

165 - 60 = 105 plants
So, 105 plants grew completely or partially from the 55 seeds that the mother planted."
Response:  If Maa is planting flowers in each pot and adding 10 beans to each pot, then she has 30 pots (since there are 30 beans in total). Now, if she wants to distribute them equally among 60 pots, she will have to divide them into groups of 20 pots each. So, each group of 20 pots will contain 5 beans ( since there are 30 beans in total and 60 pots in total). Therefore, the number of beans in each pot will be 5/60 = 0.083 beans per pot.
Response:  If Maa has 8 apples in her basket and she gives 32 beans to each of her 4 children, then the total number of beans given to all the children is:  Number of beans given to each child = Total number of beans / Number of children = 32 beans / 4 children = 8 beans per child. So, each apple contains 8 beans.
Response:  If Meethio has given one of his 11 friends 2 crackers each, then he has given a total of 22 crackers (11 friends x 2 crackers per friend). So, Meethio now has 98 crackers left (100 - 22 = 98).
Response:  If Meethio has 8 friends and he wants to give each friend 2 crackers, then how many crackers will Meethio give in total?  Total number of crackers given by Meethio = Number of friends x Number of crackers per friend = 8 x 2 = 16 crackers.
Response:  If Meethio had 15 crackers and he gave one to each of his five friends, then he would have given away 15/5 = 3 crackers. Since 10 crackers remained with him after giving them away, he must have given away 3 crackers. Therefore, each friend got 3 crackers from Meethio.
Response:  Meethio had 24 cookies and gave 3 to each of his 5 friends. So he gave in total 15 cookies (3 x 5 = 15). Now, if Meethio had 17 remaining cookies after giving some to his friends, then he must have given 17 - 15 = 2 cookies to his friends. Therefore, Meethio gave 2 cookies to his friends.
"Response:  If Meethio has 22 crickets and 34 cakes to share among his 11 friends, each friend will get:

Cricket distribution: 22 / 11 = 2 crickets per friend
Cake distribution: 34 / 11 = 3 cakes per friend
So, each person will receive 2 crickets and 3 cakes."
Response:  If Meethio has 29 creeks and 30 kicks, he can give one creek to each of his two friends. So, he will have 29 - 2 = 27 creeks left after giving them away. Similarly, if he gives 1 kick to each friend, he will be left with 30 - 2 = 28 kicks. Therefore, the final number of creeks Meethio has is 27, and the final number of kicks he has is 28.
"Response:  If Meethiou has 14 creamers and 21 cookies to share among his friends, he will have to distribute them equally among all of them. So, each friend will get:

Number of creamers = Total number of creamers / Number of friends
= 14 / 5 (friends)
= 2.8 creamers per friend

Similarly, for cookies:

Number of cookies = Total number of cookies / Number of friends
= 21 / 5 (friends)
= 4.2 cookies per friend

Therefore, each person will receive approximately 2.8 creamers and 4.2 cookies from Meethiou."
Response:  Mitthu has given 18 friends cream cookies. If each friend gets one cookie, then the total number of cookies distributed is 18 x 1 = 18. Now, if there are 36 people in total, and each person got k cream cookies (where k is the number of cookies Mitthu gave to his 18 friends), then we can write the equation as follows: 36 / k = 18. Solving for k, we get: k = 36 / 18 = 2. Therefore, each person got 2 cream cookies from Mitthu.
Response:  Miathiou has given 6 creamers to each of his friends. If he had 36 creamers in total, then he gave away 36 / 6 = 6 creamers to each friend. Therefore, he gave away 6 x 5 = 30 creamers in total.
Response:  Mitthu had 23 cookies and gave 11 to his two friends. So, he has 12 cookies left (23 - 11 = 12). Now, each of his two friends got how many cookies? To find this out, we need to divide the number of cookies Mitthu gave them by the number of friends he gave them to. In this case, Mitthu gave 11 cookies to 2 friends, so each friend got 5 cookies (11 / 2 = 5).
"Response:  Meethio has 31 creeks and he gave away 23 of them to his 5 friends. So, the number of creeks Meethio has left is:

31 - 23 = 8

Therefore, Meethio has 8 creeks left."
Response:  Muhammad has given each of his four friends 16 cream cookies and 48 chocolate candies. If there are 32 cream cookies in total and 98 chocolate candies in total, then each friend got: Number of cream cookies = Total number of cream cookies / Number of friends = 32 / 4 = 8 per friend Number of chocolate candies = Total number of chocolate candies / Number of friends = 98 / 4 = 24 per friend Therefore, each person received 8 cream cookies and 24 chocolate candies.
Response:  Muhammad has given each of his four friends one cake and 5 creamers. If there are 10 creamers in total, then each friend got 5/10 = 0.5 creamers. Similarly, if there were 8 kicks in total, then each friend got 8/10 = 0.8 kicks. So, to find out how many kicks each person got, we can multiply the number of creamers they received by 0.8 (since each creamer represents 0.8 kicks). Therefore, Person A got 0.8 x 0.5 = 0.4 kicks, Person B got 0.8 x 0.6 = 0.48 kicks, Person C got 0.8 x 0.7 = 0.56 kicks, and Person D got 0.8 x 0.9 = 0.72 kicks.
"Response:  There are 28 friends and each friend has to share either cakes or creamers equally among themselves. If there are 13 creamers and 15 cakes, then each friend will get:

Creamers: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 1/2) creamer per friend
Cakes: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 1/2) cake per friend"
"Response:  The water tank can hold 109 bottles if it is full. If the water level decreases to 74% of its capacity, then the number of bottles that can be filled is:

Number of bottles = Capacity of water tank / Percentage of water level
= 109 / 0.74
= 146

So, Devi filled 146 bottles with water from the tank."
Response:  If Deba bought 153 bottles of water and he drank one bottle every day for 17 days, then he would have drunk 153 x 17 = 2491 bottles of water in total. So, the answer is 2491.
Response:  According to the given information, Debi bought 264 bottles of water at Rs. 50 per bottle and then sold them for Rs. 75 each. If he had 11 days to sell these bottles, how many bottles does he have left? To find out, we need to calculate the total number of bottles Debi has after selling all his stock in 11 days. We know that Debi sold 264 bottles initially, so if he sells them at Rs. 75 per bottle, he will earn a total revenue of: Total Revenue = Number of Bottles x Selling Price = 264 x Rs. 75 = Rs. 19,350 Now, let's see how much profit Debi made from selling these bottles: Profit = Total Revenue - Cost = Rs. 19,350 - (Initial Investment / Number of Bottles) = Rs. 19,350 - (Rs. 264 / 264) = Rs. 19,350 - Rs. 1 = Rs. 19,350 So, Debi earned a profit of Rs. 19,350 from selling all his 264 bottles in 11 days. Now, let's find out how many bottles Debi has left after selling all his stock: Number of Bottles Left = Remaining Stock / Initial Stock = (Number of Bottles Sold - Total Revenue) / Initial Stock = (264 - 19,350) / 264 = 248 / 264 = 0.93 or approximately 93 bottles Now, since Debi has 93 bottles left after selling all his stock, he has 93 - 11 = 82 bottles left with him currently. Therefore, Debi has 82 bottles left with him currently.
Response:  Debi bought 301 bottles of water at Rs. 2 each and sold them for Rs. 144 per bottle after some time. If he had 157 bottles left after selling them for how many days?  Days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles sold per day = 157 bottles / 144 bottles per day = 11 days
Response:  If Deba bought 88 pots of water and 13 sundries in one day, then he had $40 left after buying those items. Now, if he wants to buy 4 pots of water and 87 sundries in the next day, how many days will it take him to spend his entire $40? Solution: To find out how many days it will take Deba to spend his entire $40, we need to divide the total amount he has ($40) by the cost of each pot of water (which is $1). So, the number of days it will take Deba to spend his entire $40 is: $\frac{40}{1} = 40$ days. Therefore, Deba can spend his entire $40 in 40 days.
Response:  Firstly, Debi bought 200 bottles of water and 256 sodas in one day. If she sold each bottle of water for Rs. 5 and each soda for Rs. 7, then her total revenue from these items would be: Water bottles x Price = Rs. (200 x Rs. 5) = Rs. 1000 Sodas x Price = Rs. (256 x Rs. 7) = Rs. 1800 Total Revenue = Rs. 1000 + Rs. 1800 = Rs. 2800 Now, if she wants to know how many days it will take to sell all these items, we need to divide the total revenue by the amount she earns per day: Total Revenue / Daily Earnings = Rs. 2800 /? = X Days Where X is the number of days it will take to sell all the items. Since Debi earned Rs. 1000 per day from selling water bottles and Rs. 1800 per day from selling sodas, her daily earnings are: Daily Earnings = Rs. 1000 (from water bottles) + Rs. 1800 (from sodas) = Rs. 2800 So, to find out how many days it will take to sell all the items, we can simply divide the total revenue by the daily earnings: Number of Days = Total Revenue / Daily Earnings = Rs. 2800 / Rs. 2800 = 1 Day Therefore, it will take Debi exactly one day to sell all the items she purchased.
Response:  We have 6 bottles of water in total, and each bottle contains 12 pints. So, we have a total of 6 x 12 = 72 pints of water. Now, if we want to know how many days it will last, we need to divide the total amount of water by the number of people who will consume it per day. In this case, there are 4 people who will consume water per day, so we can calculate the duration as follows: Number of days = Total amount of water / Number of people consuming water per day = 72 pints / 4 people per day = 18 days Therefore, the water will last for 18 days.
Response:  Firstly, Debi bought 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of juice. If they were sold at Rs. 20 per bottle of water and Rs. 30 per bottle of juice, then the total amount earned from selling these bottles is: Water bottles x Price = Rs. 95 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 1900 Juice bottles x Price = Rs. 180 x Rs. 30 = Rs. 5400 Total earnings = Rs. 1900 + Rs. 5400 = Rs. 7300 Now, if they want to sell 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of juice in one day, their daily earnings will be: Water bottles x Price = Rs. 15 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 300 Juice bottles x Price = Rs. 54 x Rs. 30 = Rs. 1620 Total daily earnings = Rs. 300 + Rs. 1620 = Rs. 1920 So, after one day, Debi will have earned Rs. 1920.
Response:  Firstly, Debi bought 360 socks and 162 pants in one day. If she had spent Rs. 122 on pants and Rs. 9 on socks, then she must have spent a total of Rs. 131 on these items. Now, if we assume that Debi buys 9 pairs of socks every day for 10 days, then she will buy a total of 9 x 10 = 90 pairs of socks during this period. Similarly, if she buys 122 pants every day for 10 days, then she will buy a total of 122 x 10 = 1220 pants during this period. Therefore, the number of socks and pants that Debi will buy over 10 days is: Socks - 90 Pants - 1220
Response:  We have 14 boxes in total and each box contains 11 pens. So, the total number of pens is: 14 x 11 = 154 pens.
Response:  If Faisal has 12 pens in total and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends, then each friend will get 2 pens (12 / 5 = 2).  Now, if Faisal wants to give one pen to each of these 5 friends again, then he will have 4 pens left (12 - 5 x 2 = 4).
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 16 pens in total and each pen has 24 balls inside it. So, the total number of balls is:

16 pens x 24 balls/pen = 384 balls

Therefore, the correct answer is 384."
Response:  There are 50 pens in total and each pen has 22 parts. So, there are 50 x 22 = 1100 parts in total. Now, out of these 1100 parts, 6 pieces are from each of the 6 pens that have been broken into pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces from each pen is 6/6 = 1. So, there are 1100 / 1 = 1100 pieces in total.
Response:  We have 50 pans in total and we want to divide them equally among 7 containers. So, each container will get 7 pans (50/7 = 7). Now, let's assume that there are 35 pans left after dividing them into 7 containers. Therefore, the remaining pans (35) can be divided equally among 2 containers (35/2 = 17-1=16).
Response:  We have 19 cars in total and each car has 4 passengers, so we have 19 x 4 = 76 passengers in total. Now, let's consider how many coronavirus cases there are among these passengers. Since each passenger can potentially infect 2-3 people on average (this is just an estimate based on current data), we can assume that there are approximately 76 / 2 = 38 coronavirus cases among the passengers. Therefore, out of 19 cars, 38 coronavirus cases are present.
"Response:  We have 36 pens and 30 pencils in each box. So, if we divide the total number of pens (36) by the number of boxes (4), we get:

Number of pens per box = 36 / 4 = 9

Similarly, if we divide the total number of pencils (30) by the number of boxes (4), we get:

Number of pencils per box = 30 / 4 = 7.5

So, there are 9 pens and 7.5 pencils in each box."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 11 compartments in total and each compartment has 31 pulses and 27 corn kernels. So, the total number of pulses is: 31 x 11 = 341 pulses And the total number of corn kernels is: 27 x 11 = 297 corn kernels Therefore, there are 341 pulses and 297 corn kernels in the box.
Response:  If Fayyaz has 30 pens in total and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends, then each friend will get 6 pens (30 / 5 = 6).
Response:  If Fei has 5 balls in one basket and 3 balls in another basket, then he has a total of 8 balls (5 + 3 = 8).  Now, if there are 6 baskets in total, then each basket contains how many balls?  To find out, we divide the total number of balls (8) by the number of baskets (6): 8 / 6 = 1.33... balls per basket. So, Fei has approximately 1 ball in each of the 6 baskets.
Response:  There are 35 pencils in total and each pencil has 4 parts (lead, wood, eraser, and paint). So, there are 35 x 4 = 140 parts in total. Now, we need to find out how many of these parts can be made into two complete pencils. To do this, we divide the total number of parts by 2, which gives us 140 / 2 = 70 parts that can be used to make two complete pencils. Therefore, each pencil requires 70/4 = 17.5 parts.
Response:  We have 31 pencils in total and each pencil has 6 leads inside it. So, we have 31 x 6 = 186 leads in total.
Response:  We have 30 boxes of apples and each box contains 71 apples. So, in total we have 30 x 71 = 2130 apples. Now, out of these 2130 apples, 24 are spoiled. Therefore, the remaining number of good apples is 2130 - 24 = 2106 apples.
Response:  According to the question, Farhan has 16 pens and he wants to distribute them equally among his 4 friends. Since each friend will get an equal number of pens, we can divide 16 by 4 to find out how many pens each friend will get. So, each friend will get 4/16 = 0.25 pens. Now, since there are 6 pens in one pack, we need to calculate how many packs Farhan can buy with 0.25 pens. Therefore, we divide 0.25 by 6 to find out that Farhan can buy 0.04 packs of pens. Finally, since there are 21 pens in one box, we need to calculate how many boxes Farhan can buy with 0.04 packs of pens. Therefore, we divide 0.04 by 21 to find out that Farhan can buy 0.0019 boxes of pens.
Response:  There are 21 classes in total and each class has 30 students on average, so there are 660 students in total (21 x 30 = 660). Now, out of these 660 students, 98 are teachers, which means that the remaining 562 students are students (660 - 98 = 562).
Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and 95 students enrolled in these classes. Since each class has 118 students, we can calculate the total number of students in the school as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 84 x 118 Total Number of Students = 9,632 students. Therefore, there are approximately 9,632 students in this school.
Response:  There are 67 classes in total and each class has 65 students, so there are 67 x 65 = 4215 students in the school. If we assume that every student needs at least 6 books for each subject, then the total number of books required is 4215 x 6 = 25930 books. Therefore, the answer is 25930 books.
"Response:  There are 87 classes in total, and each class has an average of 5 students per room. If there are two rooms in each school, then the number of rooms required is:

Number of schools = Total number of classes / Number of classes per room
= 87 / 5
= 17.4 rooms (round off to 18 rooms)

So, approximately 18 rooms are needed for all the classes in this scenario."
"Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in this school and each class has an average of 35 students. So, the total number of students in all classes is:

24 classes x 35 students/class = 840 students

Therefore, there are 840 students in this school."
"Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in the school and 102 teachers. Each class has 8 students, so the total number of students in the school is:

66 classes x 8 students/class = 504 students

Now, we need to find out how many students have not gone for any trip. If 22 students have not gone for any trip, then the remaining students who have gone for at least one trip are:

504 students - 22 students = 482 students

Therefore, the required number of buses needed to take all the students for their trips is:

482 students / 8 students/bus = 60 buses"
Response:  There are 102 classes in the school and 11 teachers. Each teacher teaches 99 students, so there are 99 x 11 = 1099 students in total. If 8 of them do not attend school, then the number of absent students is 1099 - 8 = 1091.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in each school and each class has 3 sections. So, the total number of sections in all schools is:

72 x 3 = 216

Now, if there are 111 teachers in all schools, then the number of teachers per section would be:

216 / 111 = 1.91

So, approximately 1.91 teachers are required for each section."
Response:  There are 17 classes in the school and each class has 46 students, making a total of 92 students in the school.
Response:  There are 11 boys in Helen's class who like to play cricket. If each boy gets 9 balls, then how many balls will be required for all the boys?  Solution: Total number of boys = 11 Number of balls required per boy = 9 Therefore, total number of balls required = Total number of boys x Number of balls required per boy = 11 x 9 = 99 balls.
Response:  If Heli has 10 marbles and gives each of her 5 friends 2 marbles, then she will have 3 marbles left (10 - 5 x 2 = 3). So, Heli gave 3 marbles to 5 friends.
Response:  If there are 23 girls in Haley's class and each girl has 15 marbles, then the total number of marbles that all the girls in the class have is: 23 x 15 = 345 marbles. So, each girl has 345 / 23 = 14.6 marbles on average.
Response:  There are 13 boys in the class who like to play cricket and each of them can contribute $50 towards buying new equipment for the game. Therefore, the total amount contributed by these 13 boys is $50 x 13 = $650. Now, there are 50 students in the class altogether, including both boys and girls. If 26 of them (including all 13 boys) want to buy new equipment for the game, then the remaining 24 students (i.e., 50 - 26) do not want to contribute anything. So, the total amount contributed by those 24 students is zero.
Response:  There are 20 girls in the class and each girl has 10 balls. So, there are total 20 x 10 = 200 balls in the class. Now, out of these 200 balls, 2 boys share equally among themselves. Since there are 2 boys, they will get 200 / 2 = 100 balls each. Therefore, each boy will have 100 balls.
Response:  If there are 10 students in Helen's class and each student has two marbles, then the total number of marbles is 20 (10 students x 2 marbles per student). Now, if Helen gives away 5 marbles to other kids outside her class, then she will have 15 marbles left (20 - 5 = 15). So, the number of marbles that Helen has after giving them away is 15.
Response:  According to the given information, Franek read his favorite book for 14 days continuously without taking any break. Since there are 392 pages in the book, he would have read approximately 25 pages per day (392/14 = 27). So, Franek took around 14 x 27 = 368 days to complete reading his favorite book.
Response:  According to the given information, Franek's favorite book had 22 pages and he read it for 569 days. Now, we need to find out how many pages Franek read per day. To do this, we divide the number of pages (22) by the number of days (569):  Number of pages read per day = Number of pages / Number of days = 22 / 569 = 0.038 pages/day So, Franek read approximately 0.038 pages per day.
Response:  The book had 612 pages and Frank read it for 6 days, which means he read approximately 102 pages per day (612 / 6 = 102).
Response:  According to Frank's statement, he read his favorite book for 220 days straight without taking any breaks. Since there are 555 pages in the book, and each page takes approximately 1 minute to read, we can calculate how many minutes Frank spent reading the book as follows: Minutes = Pages x Time per Page = 555 x 60 = 33,700 minutes Now, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert these minutes into hours as follows: Hours = Minutes / 60 = 33,700 / 60 = 561 hours Therefore, Frank spent 561 hours reading his favorite book.
Response:  According to the question, Frank read his favorite book for 193 pages and spent 660 days reading it. Now, we need to find out how many hours he spent reading that book. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of hours = Total time spent / Time per page So, in this case, the total time spent reading the book is 660 days, which is equal to 193 pages x 660 days/page = 124,800 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert these minutes into hours as follows: Number of hours = 124,800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2076 hours Therefore, Frank spent 2076 hours reading his favorite book.
"Response:  According to the given information, Frank read 249 pages in each book and took 3 days to complete reading one book. So, if he reads 5 books, it will take him:

Total pages = Number of books x Total pages per book
= 5 x 249
= 1245 pages

Time taken to read all 5 books = Time taken to read one book x Number of books
= 3 days x 5
= 15 days

Therefore, Frank would have read 1245 pages in total and taken 15 days to finish reading all 5 books."
Response:  According to the given information:  Number of books = 66  Number of pages in each book = 10 (average)  Time taken to read one book = 12 days  Total time taken to read all books = 66 x 10 = 660 hours  If Frank had read all 492 books in total, then he would have spent: 660 hours / 492 books = 1.35 years  So, Frank read approximately 1.35 years worth of books.
Response:  According to the given information, Frank loved reading books and had read his favorite book for 16 days straight. If there were 112 pages in that book, he would have read approximately 112/16 = 7 pages per day.
Response:  The book has 576 pages and the person reads 8 pages per day. To find out how many days it will take to read the complete book, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages So, in this case, the total number of pages is 576, and the daily reading pages are 8. Therefore, the number of days required to read the complete book is: Number of days = 576 / 8 = 72 days Now, rounding off the result to the nearest whole number, we get 70 days. Hence, if the person continues to read at a rate of 8 pages per day, it will take them approximately 70 days to finish reading the entire book.
Response:  According to Frank's statement, he read his favorite book for 30 days straight and completed it in 41 chapters with each chapter containing approximately 450 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Frank read during those 30 days is:  Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 41 x 450 = 18,650 pages Now, we need to convert this value from pages to hours. As there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the time spent reading by dividing the total pages by the number of hours in a day: Time spent reading = Total pages / 24 hours = 18,650 pages / 24 hours = 779 hours So, Frank spent approximately 779 hours reading his favorite book over 30 days.
Response:  According to the passage, Frank loved reading his favorite book and had read it for 607 days straight. The book contained 594 pages, and each page took him approximately 2 minutes to read. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read as follows: Total pages = Number of pages in the book x Time taken to read each page Total time = Number of pages x Time taken to read each page Now, let's substitute the values given in the passage: Total pages = 594 x 2 Total time = 1188 hours Now, converting hours to minutes gives us the total number of minutes Frank spent reading his favorite book: Total minutes = Total time in hours x 60 Total minutes = 1188 x 60 = 71,432 minutes So, Frank read approximately 71,432 minutes of his favorite book over the course of 607 days.
Response:  According to the question, Frank read his favorite book for 664 days without taking a break. If each page had 405 lines per page (as mentioned in the question), then the total number of pages he read would be: Total Number of Pages = Total Lines / Lines Per Page = 664 Days x 405 Lines/Page = 266,100 Pages Now, we need to find out how many days Frank spent reading each page. To do this, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading: Total Days Spent Reading = Total Number of Pages / Number of Days Read = 266,100 Pages / 664 Days = approximately 397 days So, Frank spent approximately 397 days reading his favorite book.
Response:  The price of each Devi Devi Delivery Pack is Rs. 120. Since there are 6 packs in total, the cost of all 6 packs would be: 6 x Rs. 120 = Rs. 720. So, the price of one pack is Rs. 720 / 6 = Rs. 120 per pack.
Response:  If each pack of cigarettes costs $81, and there are 33 days in a month, then we can calculate how many packs of cigarettes one person can buy in a month as follows: Number of packs = Total cost / Daily cost per pack = $8100 / $243 = 330 packs So, if someone smokes 330 packs of cigarettes in a month, it would cost them $8100.
Response:  If each Devi Payal is worth Rs. 107, then there are 93 Devi Payals in total (Rs. 107 x 93 = Rs. 9510). So, if you want to buy all the Devi Payals, you will have to pay Rs. 9510.
Response:  If each DVD costs $76 and you want to buy one for $25 less than its original price, then the discounted price of that particular DVD is: $76 - $25 = $51 So, if you can get 4 such DVDs at this discounted price, it would cost you: $51 x 4 = $204 Now, since you have mentioned that there are 7 DVDs in total, let's calculate how many sets of 4 DVDs you can make with the given amount: $204 / $51 = 3.98 sets Of course, you cannot make fractional sets, so round up to the nearest whole number: 4 sets Therefore, you can buy 4 sets of 4 DVDs each at the discounted price of $51 per set, making a total cost of $204.
Response:  If each pick costs $26, and you have $104 in total, then you can buy how many picks? To find out, divide your total amount of money ($104) by the cost of one pick ($26): $104 / $26 = 4 So, you can buy 4 picks with your $104.
Response: 1 DVD costs around $20 in Pakistan, so one set of two DVDs would cost twice that amount, which is approximately $40. Therefore, the price of each DVD in this case would be $40 / 2 = $20 per DVD.
Response:  We have 18 balls in total and we want to divide them into 2 groups of equal size. So, if we divide them equally among 2 groups, each group will get 9 balls (18 / 2 = 9).
"Response:  We have to find out how many moons are in each of the 140 groups and then sum them up.  If there are 187 shapes in total, that means we have to divide 187 by 140 to get the number of moons per group. So, the number of moons in each group is:

187 / 140 = 1.329 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 1.329 moons in each of the 140 groups."
Response:  We have 203 kids in total and they are divided into 7 groups of 28 each. Now, if we divide these 7 groups into 95 subgroups of 2 people each, then each subgroup will consist of one kid from Group A and one kid from Group B. So, the distribution of kids among different subgroups would be as follows: Group A - 14 kids (since there are 14 kids in Group A), Group B - 14 kids (since there are 14 kids in Group B). Therefore, the number of kids in each subgroup is 14.
Response:  We have 142 groups in total and each group has 356 students. If we divide them into 47 groups of equal size, then each group will have 356/47 = 7 students per group. So, there are 7 students in each group.
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in the set of all possible combinations of 4 elements from a set of 8 elements. Now, we need to find out how many elements each group can have. If we consider the combination of 4 elements as one ""group"", then each group can have up to 392 elements (since there are 392 ways to choose 4 elements from 8). So, the number of elements in each group is: Number of elements in each group = 392 Therefore, if there are n groups, the total number of elements is: Total number of elements = Number of elements in each group x Number of groups = 392 x n"
"Response:  We know that there are 18 groups in the set of 18 shapes. Each group consists of 6 shapes, so the total number of shapes is:

18 x 6 = 108

Therefore, there are 108 shapes in the set of 18 shapes."
Response:  There are 87 seniors and 290 kids in total. If we divide them into two groups of equal size, each group will have 43.5 people (87 / 2 = 43.5). Now, if we further divide these 43.5 people into 93 groups of equal size, each group will have approximately 0.46 people (43.5 / 93 = 0.046). So, one kid's group will have approximately 0.46 people.
Response:  We have 384 satellites in total and we want to divide them into 345 groups of 10 each or fewer. So, we will have 345 groups. Now, let's assume that we divided these groups equally among the 16 satellite bands. The number of satellites in each band would be: Number of groups = 345 Total satellites = 384 Satellites per group = Total satellites / Number of groups = 384 / 345 = 10.71 satellites per group Therefore, there will be approximately 10.71 satellites in each of the 16 satellite bands.
Response:  The mother has made 38 cookies and wants to distribute them equally among 19 people. So, each person will get 2 cookies (38 / 19 = 2).
Response:  The mother has made 14 kokis and each koki contains 30 pieces. So, in total, she has made 14 x 30 = 420 pieces of kokis.
Response:  The mother made 5 cookies and gave them to each of her 5 children. So, she had given away 5 x 5 = 25 cookies in total. But then, she baked 22 more cookies, which means she has 22 + 25 = 47 cookies left with her. Therefore, there are 47 cookies left with the mother.
Response:  The mother has 10 cookies and wants to distribute them equally among 10 people. However, only 9 people show up. If she had given each of the absent person 2 cookies (as there were 18 cookies in total), then each of the present people would have received 3 cookies (since there are 10 people). So, the number of cookies each person got is:  Number of cookies each person got = Total number of cookies / Number of people who showed up = 18 cookies / 9 people = 2 cookies per person.
"Response:  The mother has given each of two men 14 cookies in total. If we assume that each man gets an equal number of cookies (i.e., no one got more than the other), then the number of cookies each man received is:

Cookies per person = Total number of cookies / Number of people
= 14 / 2
= 7

So, each man received 7 cookies from the mother."
Response:  The mother has given each of her 5 children 2 cookies each. So, in total, she has given 5 x 2 = 10 cookies to her children.
Response:  If Frank has 42 tanks and he wants to divide them equally among two big bags, then each bag will get 42/2 = 21 tanks.
Response:  If Frank has 26 beads in total and he wants to divide them equally among 33 bags of 10 beads each, then we need to calculate how many beads will be left over after dividing them into 33 equal parts. So, let's do that calculation: Number of beads = Total number of beads / Number of equal parts = 26 / 33 = 0.8  Since there are 0.8 beads left over after dividing them into 33 equal parts, therefore, the number of beads in each bag is: Number of beads in each bag = Remaining beads / Number of bags = 0.8 / 33 = 0.025 beads per bag Now, if we multiply this value with 33 bags, we get: Number of beads in all bags = Number of beads in each bag x Number of bags = 0.025 x 33 = 0.825 beads Therefore, there are approximately 0.825 beads in each bag.
Response:  Frink has 33 ticks and he wants to distribute them equally among 24 bags. So, each bag will get 1.36 tick (33/24). Now, if he wants to divide these remaining 9 ticks equally among 9 bags, then each bag will get 0.99 tick (9/9). Therefore, the total number of ticks that Frank has is 1.36 + 0.99 = 2.35 ticks.
Response:  Frink has given 11 tokes in each big bag. If he had 22 tokens in total, then he would have given 22 / 11 = 2 times as many tokes in each big bag. So, there will be 2 x 11 = 22 tokes in each big bag.
Response:  If Frank has 16 tokers in his pocket and each token is worth $10, then he has a total of $160 in his pocket. Now, if we divide this amount equally among the two bags, each bag will have $80.
Response:  If Sherly has 25 boxes of fruits and each box contains 14 apples, then she has a total of 25 x 14 = 350 apples in all.
Response:  Shalli has given 10 tricks to Farooq. If he wants to give each of the 5 khans 2 tricks each, then how many tricks will be left?  There are 5 khans in total, so they will get 5 x 2 = 10 tricks in total. Therefore, there will be 10 - 10 = 0 tricks left with Shalli.
Response:  We have 67 balls in one box and 9 balls in another box. To find out how many more balls are there in the second box than in the first box, we need to subtract the number of balls in the second box from the number of balls in the first box. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 67 - 9 = 58. Therefore, there are 58 more balls in the second box than in the first box.
"Response:  We have 22 boots in one store and 61 boots in another store. To find out how many more boots are there in the second store than in the first store, we need to subtract the number of boots in the first store from the number of boots in the second store:

Number of boots in second store - Number of boots in first store = 61 - 22 = 39

So, there are 39 more boots in the second store than in the first store."
Response:  We have 30 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 8 players. So, each player will get 3/8 of the total number of balls which is 37.5 ( rounded off to nearest integer = 38). Now, out of these 38 balls, 41 are seeds and remaining 7 are dice. Therefore, the number of balls each player gets is 38 - 41 = -3 or 0 balls.
Response:  We have 79 balls in total (including both types). Out of these, 53 are white and 42 are red. So, if we want to know how many more white balls there are than red balls, we can subtract the number of red balls from the total number of balls:  Number of white balls = Total balls - Number of red balls = 79 - 42 = 37 White balls. Therefore, there are 37 more white balls than red balls.
"Response:  We have 54 buttons in one group and 83 buttons in another group. To find out how many more buttons are there in the second group than in the first group, we need to subtract the number of buttons in the first group from the number of buttons in the second group:

Number of buttons in second group - Number of buttons in first group = 83 - 54 = 29

So, there are 29 more buttons in the second group than in the first group."
Response:  We have 17 balls in total and we want to know how many of them are dirty. So, if 9 out of 17 (or 53%) are dirty, then there are 9 dirty balls. Now, let's calculate the number of clean balls. Since there are 29 seeds in total, and 9 are dirty, that means there are 20 clean seeds (29 - 9 = 20). Therefore, there are 9 dirty balls and 20 clean balls.
Response:  We have 19 desks in one room and 60 beds in another room. To find out how many more beds there are than desks, we need to subtract the number of desks from the number of beds. So, the difference between 60 and 19 is 41. Therefore, there are 41 more beds than desks.
Response:  We have 72 balls in total (including the ones that are already inside the box).  Out of these, 32 balls are already inside the box, so we have 40 balls left outside. Now, out of these 40 balls, 78 are seeds and 12 are not seeds (as mentioned in the question). So, the number of seeds is 78.
Response:  We have 36 seeds in one packet and we want to distribute them equally among 80 pots. So, each pot will get 0.45 seeds (36/80). Now, we have 54 pots that need soil, so each pot will get 0.67 seeds (54/80). Therefore, there are 29.17 seeds left over after distributing them equally among all pots (0.67 x 80 = 52.26, which is greater than 36).
Response:  We have 30 balls in total and we want to divide them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 6 balls (30/5 = 6). Now, let's say that out of these 6 balls, 2 are defective, so we take away those 2 balls from each person. Therefore, each person now has 4 balls left (6 - 2 = 4). Finally, there are 20 balls remaining, which means that 4 people got 5 balls each (20 / 5 = 4), and the last person got 1 ball (20 / 4 = 5). So, the number of balls that were not defective is 4 x 5 = 20.
"Response:  We have 4 balls in one container and we want to know how many more balls are needed to fill 79 containers with the same size as the ones used for the 4 balls.

So, let x be the number of additional balls required to fill 79 containers. Since each container can hold 4 balls, we need x/4 balls per container. Therefore, the total number of additional balls required is x \* (79 / 4) = 1965 balls."
Response:  We have 57 balls in total and we need to distribute them equally among 4 groups of people. So, each group will get 14 balls (57 / 4 = 14). Now, out of these 14 balls, 26 are white and 27 are light blue. Therefore, each person in Group A will get 3 white balls and 2 light blue balls (26 / 4 = 6 + 6), while each person in Group B will get 4 white balls and 3 light blue balls (27 / 4 = 6 + 5). Similarly, each person in Group C will get 5 white balls and 4 light blue balls (26 / 4 = 5 + 5), and each person in Group D will get 6 white balls and 5 light blue balls (27 / 4 = 6 + 5).
Response:  We have 81 balls in total (60 white and 21 red). To find out how many white balls are left after 60 white balls are drawn, we need to subtract 60 from 81. So, there are 21 white balls remaining. Similarly, to find out how many red balls are left after 60 red balls are drawn, we need to subtract 60 from 21. So, there is only one red ball remaining. Therefore, the final answer is: White balls = 21 Red balls = 1
Response:  We have 49 balls in total (40 white and 9 red).  To find out how many pairs of equal-valued balls we can make, we need to divide the total number of balls by 2. So, we have 49 / 2 = 24 pairs of equal-valued balls. Now, let's count the number of lit balls. There are 6 lit balls in total. Therefore, the final answer is 24 pairs + 6 lit balls = 30 balls.
Response:  On day 1, there were 317 people at the conference hall. If we subtract the number of people who attended the previous day (295), then the difference is 22. So, 22 people attended the conference on that particular day.
Response:  On day 1, there were 703 visitors who came to see the exhibition after seeing the advertisement in the newspaper. If 246 of them visited the exhibition on that day, then the number of visitors on other days can be calculated as follows: Number of visitors on other days = Total number of visitors x Percentage of visitors who visited on other days Total number of visitors = 703 Visitors on day 1 x (1 - 0.34) = 703 x 0.66 = 459 visitors on other days Therefore, 459 people visited the exhibition on other days.
Response:  On day 1, there were 100 visitors to Bangham Market. If each visitor spent an average of $50 per person (which is a rough estimate), then the total amount spent at Bangham Market on that day was $5,000 ($100 x 50). Now, if 666 people visited Bangham Market on that day (which is the maximum number of visitors allowed according to the question), then the total amount spent at Bangham Market on that day would be $33,000 ($5,000 x 666).
"Response:  On day 1, there were 132 visitors to the Bangham Market. If 406 people visited in total over the last 327 days (including the current day), then the average number of visitors per day is:

Average number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 406 / 327
= 1.25
So, approximately 1.25 visitors came to the Bangham Market every day during the last 327 days."
"Response:  According to the given information, after one delicacy shop was closed down, 45 people had visited it in the last few days. If 829 people had visited the place during the last 85 days, then the number of visitors per day is:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 10
So, 10 people visited the place every day during the last 85 days."
Response:  On day 1, there were 71 people in Bangham Market. If 188 people came to Bangham Market in total, then on day 557, there would be 557 - 188 = 369 people at Bangham Market. So, during those 57 days, 369 x 57 / 71 = 2045 people visited Bangham Market.
Response:  On day 1, there were 39 people in Bangham Market. If we assume that each person can accommodate 2 guests (as per the given information), then the total number of guests who visited Bangham Market on day 1 would be: 39 x 2 = 78 guests. Therefore, 78 guests visited Bangham Market on day 1.
Response:  On that day (the day after the earthquake), there were 92 people at the meeting place. If we subtract the number of visitors who came before the earthquake (419) from the total number of visitors (512), then the number of visitors who came after the earthquake is 103. So, the correct answer is 103.
Response:  On day 512, there were 512 people who went to Bangham Market. If we subtract the number of people who visited Bangham Market in the previous days (471), then the remaining number of visitors is 41 (i.e., 512 - 471 = 41). Now, if we divide this number by the number of days between day 512 and the first day (89 days), we get the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days = 41 / 89 = 0.46 or approximately 46 visitors per day. Therefore, the answer is 46 visitors per day.
Response:  On day 705, there were 705 visitors to Bangham Palace if we assume that the number of visitors remains constant over time.  In contrast, on day 191, there were only 191 visitors to Bangham Palace. Therefore, during the remaining 414 days (i.e., from day 191 to day 705), the number of visitors increased by 314 people (i.e., 705 - 191 = 314).
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required for 628 grams of meat. To do this, we need to divide the weight of meat (628 grams) by the weight of one pice of rice (159 grams). So, we get: Number of pieces of rice = 628 g / 159 g = 4.03 pieces Now, since there is only one pice in each pack, we can round off the number of pieces to the nearest whole number, which gives us: Number of pieces of rice in a pack = 4 pieces Therefore, if you want to know how many grams of rice are in a pack, you can multiply the number of pieces with the weight of one piece: Number of grams of rice in a pack = 4 x 159 g = 636 grams
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required for each pancake and then calculate the total amount of rice needed.  If we assume that one pancake requires 1/4th cup of rice (which is equivalent to 60 grams), then we need 49 x 60 = 2940 grams of rice to make 49 pancakes. However, if we already have 260 grams of rice available, then we can use only 260 / 49 = 5.3 grams of rice per pancake. So, the remaining amount of rice left over after making 49 pancakes would be 2940 - 5.3 = 2934.7 grams.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required for 57 pans of rice and how much moisture is needed in each pan.  So, we need to divide 57 by 10 (since there are 10 pans in one batch). This gives us 5.7 grams of rice per pan. Now, we know that 22 grams of moisture are required for each pan, so we can calculate the total amount of moisture needed as follows: Total moisture = Number of pans x Amount of moisture per pan Total moisture = 57 x 22 = 1244 grams Therefore, if 353 grams of moisture are required for every 10 pans, then the number of pans that can be made with 1244 grams of moisture is: Number of pans = 1244 / 353 = 3.56 pans So, approximately 3.56 pans can be made with 1244 grams of moisture.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required for 4 people to eat equally.  Since there are 166 grams of rice in one pound, and we need 20 grams more than that, we can calculate it as follows: Number of grams of rice needed = Total amount of rice / Number of people to eat equally So, the number of grams of rice needed for 4 people is: Number of grams of rice needed = 166 grams / 4 people = 41.5 grams per person (round off to nearest whole number) Therefore, the total number of grams of rice required for 4 people is: Total number of grams of rice = 41.5 grams x 4 people = 166 grams
Response:  We are given that there are 557 grams of sugar in total and we need to find out how many grams of sugar are required for each pinky. So, if we divide the total amount of sugar (557 grams) by the number of pinkies (17), we get the required amount of sugar per pinky = 32.8 grams. Therefore, the answer is 32.8 grams.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required for 11 people to eat together. Since each person needs 492 grams of rice, we need to divide 492 by 11 to get the total amount of rice needed. Therefore, the answer is: Total amount of rice needed = 492 / 11 = 44.63 grams (approximately)
Response:  According to the given information, there are 94 people who have eaten 6 days of 100 grams of rice each day. So, in total, they have consumed 94 x 6 = 572 grams of rice per person for 6 days. Now, we need to calculate how many kilograms (kg) of rice this is equivalent to. There are 1000 grams in 1 kg, so: 572 grams / 1000 grams = 0.572 kg. Therefore, each person has consumed approximately 0.572 kg of rice for 6 days.
"Response:  If there are 266 people who have told him that he has eaten 90 drums of mangoes in 5 days, then the number of mangoes he has eaten per day is:

Number of mangoes = Total number of mangoes / Number of days
= 90 drums x 10 drums/drum = 900 mangoes/day

So, every day, he eats 900 mangoes."
Response:  The tree has grown for 146 days and produced 244 apples and 47 nectarines in total. To find out how many apples it produces per day, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of days the tree took to grow them: Number of apples produced per day = Total number of apples / Number of days taken to produce them = 244 apples / 146 days = 1.68 apples per day Now, let's calculate the same for nectarines: Number of nectarines produced per day = Total number of nectarines / Number of days taken to produce them = 47 nectarines / 146 days = 0.31 nectarines per day Therefore, the tree produces approximately 1.68 apples and 0.31 nectarines per day.
Response:  Asghar has 235 cats and he wants to give them away to his neighbors. He has already given away 100 dogs to his neighbors. So, now he has 135 cats left. If each cat eats 221 grams of rice per day, then in how many days will all the cats eat all the rice?  We know that there are 77 days left for Asghar to give away all the cats. Therefore, the number of days it will take for all the cats to eat all the rice is:  Number of days = Total amount of rice / Amount of rice consumed by each cat per day = 221 grams/cat x 135 cats = 29,635 days  So, it will take approximately 29,635 days or around 83 years for all the cats to eat all the rice if they consume 221 grams of rice per day.
Response:  According to the given information, Asif has collected 57 rupees from 252 people in exchange for 108 dam (or 0.416 kg) of rice. To find out how many grams of rice he sold per person, we can divide the total weight of rice he sold (108 dam) by the number of people who contributed (252). So, each person contributed approximately 0.416 kg / 252 = 0.001639 kg or 163.9 milligrams of rice. Now, since there are 1000 milligrams in one gram, we can convert this value to grams as follows: 0.001639 kg x 1000 mg/kg = 0.1639 g. Therefore, Asif sold approximately 0.1639 grams of rice per person.
"Response:  If it takes 8 days to collect 8 drums of water (which is equal to 240 drums), then it will take:

Time taken to fill 1 drum = Time taken to fill 8 drums / Number of drums filled per day
= 8 days / 8 drums/day
= 1 day per drum

Therefore, it will take 240 days to fill 240 drums of water."
Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each letter has its own unique shape. Therefore, we can assume that each letter of the alphabet represents one type of droplet or water molecule.  Now, let's count how many types of droplets or water molecules are present in each of the 26 alphabets:  A - 1 droplet B - 1 droplet C - 1 droplet D - 1 droplet E - 1 droplet F - 1 droplet G - 1 droplet H - 1 droplet I - 1 droplet J - 1 droplet K - 1 droplet L - 1 droplet M - 1 droplet N - 1 droplet O - 1 droplet P - 1 droplet Q - 1 droplet R - 1 droplet S - 1 droplet T - 1 droplet U - 1 droplet V - 1 droplet W - 1 droplet X - 1 droplet Y - 1 droplet Z - 1 droplet Total number of types of droplets or water molecules = 26 x 1 = 26 So, there is only one type of droplet or water molecule in each of the 26 alphabets.
Response:  We have 40 eyebrows in total, and each eyebrow has 2 hairs. So, there are 80 hairs in total.
Response:  We know that there are 56 eyelids in one eye and 10 eyelids in each of the other two eyes, making it a total of 168 eyelids. Now, let's calculate how many eyelashes are present in all three eyes combined. The number of eyelashes in one eyelid is 39, so we can multiply this number by the total number of eyelids to get the overall count of eyelashes. Therefore, there are approximately 6,272 eyelashes (168 x 39) in our entire body.
Response:  We know that there are 74 eyelids in total (including both eyes). Now, let's calculate how many eyelashes each eye has. Since each eye has two eyelids, we can assume that each eyelid has half of the number of eyelashes as there are eyelids in total. Therefore, each eye has 37 eyelashes (74 / 2 = 37). So, there are 37 eyelashes per eye.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 eyelids in one eye and 62 eyelashes in one eyebrow. Now, we need to find out how many eyelashes are present in each eyelid. To do this, we can divide the total number of eyelashes (62) by the number of eyebrows (1). So, the number of eyelashes in each eyelid is: 62 / 1 = 62 eyelashes per eyelid. Therefore, there are 62 eyelashes in each eyelid.
Response:  If there are 13 pickets in total and each picket has 39 seeds, then the total number of seeds is: 13 x 39 = 507 seeds. Therefore, there will be 507 seeds in all 13 pickets combined.
Response:  If there are 66 white t-shirts in total and each pack contains 3 white t-shirts, then we have: Total number of packs = Total number of white t-shirts / Number of t-shirts in each pack = 66 / 3 = 22 packs So, there are 22 packs of white t-shirts available for purchase.
Response:  If there are 28 packets of tea and each packet contains 56 tea leaves, then we can calculate the total number of tea leaves in one packet as follows: Number of tea leaves = Total number of packets x Number of tea leaves per packet = 28 x 56 = 1536 tea leaves So, if there are 28 packets of tea, then there are 1536 tea leaves in total.
Response:  We know that there are 53 pieces of Safiya T-shirts in total and we have to find out how many will be left after selling 34 pieces. To do this, we need to divide the total number of T-shirts by the number of T-shirts being sold. So, Number of Safiya T-shirts left = Total number of T-shirts - Number of T-shirts being sold = 53 - 34 = 19 Therefore, there will be 19 Safiya T-shirts left after selling 34 pieces.
Response:  If there are 51 white t-shirts in total and you want to buy 3 of them, then how many will be left after your purchase?  There will be 48 t-shirts left (51 - 3 = 48).
Response:  We know that there are 70 white t-shirts in total and we want to find out how many white t-shirts are in each package of 14 pieces. So, we can divide 70 by 14 to get the number of white t-shirts in each package: 70 / 14 = 5 So, there are 5 white t-shirts in each package of 14 pieces.
Response:  If there are 4 big boxes and each box contains 12 cookies, then the total number of cookies in all 4 big boxes is 4 x 12 = 48 cookies. Now, if we have 36 small boxes, and each small box contains as many cookies as the big boxes contain, then each small box will contain 48 / 36 = 1.33 cookies. So, there will be 1.33 cookies in each of the 36 small boxes.
Response:  If you have 33 cookies and each bag contains 11 cookies, then: Total number of bags = Number of cookies / Number of cookies in each bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags So, there are 3 bags.
Response:  If there are 41 cookies in each big box and you have 53 big boxes, then the total number of cookies you have is: 41 x 53 = 2193 cookies.
Response:  If there are 14 cookies in total and each big contains 7 cookies, then we can calculate the number of cookies in each big as follows: Number of cookies in each big = Total number of cookies / Number of big = 14 / 7 = 2 Therefore, each big contains 2 cookies.
Response:  If there are 3 cookies in each big bag and you have 21 bags of big bags, then the total number of cookies = Total number of big bags x Number of cookies in each big bag. So, the total number of cookies = 21 x 3 = 63 cookies.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.  If we assume that each letter represents one big, then we have:

Number of big = Number of letters x Size of each big (which is assumed to be 1)
= 26 x 1
= 26

So, there are 26 big in total."
Response:  We know that there are 14 big coins in total and we have 28 coins including 86 paisa coins. So, to find out how many big coins we have, we need to subtract the number of paisa coins from the total number of coins. Therefore, the number of big coins we have is: 28 - 14 = 14 big coins.
"Response:  If one daako can carry 5 tikas in each block and there are 10 blocks in total, then the number of tikas that one daako can carry is:

5 x 10 = 50 tikas

Now, if we assume that each house has 25 miles to deliver, then the number of houses that one daako can serve is:

50 tikas / 25 miles per tika = 2 houses per daako

Therefore, there are 2 houses per daako."
Response:  If there are 9 ticks in each block and there are 20 houses in one block, then the total number of ticks in all blocks will be: Total Number of Ticks = Number of Blocks x Number of Ticks per Block Total Number of Ticks = 20 x 9 = 180 ticks So, there are 180 ticks in all the blocks combined.
Response:  We have to find out how many ticks are in one block and then multiply it with the number of blocks to get the total number of ticks.  So, let's start by finding out how many ticks are in one block.  If there are 6 houses in each block, and each house has 24 tick marks, then we can say that there are 24 x 6 = 144 ticks in one block.  Now, if we want to know the total number of ticks in all the blocks, we just need to multiply the number of ticks in one block by the number of blocks. Therefore, the total number of ticks is 144 x 6 = 864 ticks.
Response:  We have a deck of 52 cards and each card has 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Each suit has 13 ranks (Ace to King). So, in total, we have 52 x 4 = 208 ranks. Now, let's assume that every rank is equally likely to be drawn from the deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing any particular rank is 1/208. To find out how many houses are needed to cover all possible combinations of 14 values, we can use the formula for counting combinatorial objects: n! / (k! \* (n-k)!) where n is the number of houses and k is the number of values per house. In this case, n = 14 and k = 2, so we get: n! / (2! \* (n-2)! ) = 14! / (2! \* 12!) = 262144. Therefore, there are approximately 262144 houses needed to cover all possible combinations of 14 values.
Response:  We have to find out how many tiles are required for each block and then sum them up.  Each block has 20 houses, so we need to calculate the number of tiles required for one house first.  One tile covers an area of 32 square meters, so we need 32 tiles per house.  Since there are 20 houses in each block, we need a total of 640 tiles (20 x 32 = 640) for each block.  Therefore, the total number of tiles required for all blocks is 20 x 640 = 12800 tiles.
Response:  We have to divide 78 blocks into 30 trays of size 3x4 = 12 square units each. Since there are 19 houses in one block, we need to divide 78 blocks among 19 houses. Therefore, each house will get 4 blocks (78/19 = 4).
Response:  We have to divide 55 blocks into 8 ticks each. So, we will need 7 ticks for one block (55 / 8 = 7). Now, if there are 32 houses in one block, then there will be 32 x 7 = 224 houses in total across all 8 blocks (since each block has 32 houses and we have 8 blocks). Therefore, there are 224 houses in total.
Response:  There are 81 blocks in total and each block has 4 houses. So, the total number of houses is 81 x 4 = 324 houses.
Response:  We have 16 blocks and each block has 4 tiles. So, in total we have 16 x 4 = 64 tiles. If there are 17 houses in each block, then we need to arrange these tiles in a way that each house gets exactly 4 tiles. Since there are 17 houses in each block, we can give 4 tiles to each of them, leaving no tiles left over. Therefore, the number of tiles needed to cover all 16 blocks is 64.
Response:  Rabia has 10 in-laws and 20 cousins. She wants to divide them into four groups of 5 people each. How many groups can she make? Solution: To determine how many groups Rabia can make, we need to divide the total number of people (10 + 20 = 30) by 5, which gives us 6 groups. So, Rabia can make 6 groups of 5 people each.
Response:  Rabia has 10 balls and 15 indents. We need to divide them into 5 groups of equal size. To do this, we can use division. Division is a way of dividing something into equal parts or groups. In this case, we will divide Rabia's balls and indents equally among 5 groups. So, each group will get 2 balls and 3 indents. Therefore, the answer is 5 groups with 2 balls and 3 indents in each group.
Response:  There are 11 members in Rabia's group. If each member of the group has at least 2 friends, then there will be a total of 2 x 11 = 22 people in Rabia's circle of friends. Therefore, Rabia is surrounded by 22 people.
Response:  Rabia has 8 inces and 6 gallons. If we divide these into four groups of equal size, each group will have how many inches and gallons?  To find out, let's use division.  We can divide 8 inches among 4 groups, giving each group 2 inches. Similarly, we can divide 6 gallons among 4 groups, giving each group 1.5 gallons. So, each group will have 2 inches and 1.5 gallons.
Response:  Rabia has 4 balls and 15 indents in each of three groups. To divide these into two groups of equal size, we need to find out how many indents each group should have.  Since there are 3 groups, let's call them Group A, Group B, and Group C.  We can distribute the 15 indents among these groups as follows:  Group A: 5 indents Group B: 5 indents Group C: 5 indents Therefore, each group will have an equal number of indents (5).
Response:  Rabia has 18 inches in length and 72 cm in height, while her weight is 66 kg. To categorize these measurements into groups of 4 people each, we can do as follows: Group 1 (Rabia): Length = 18 inches, Height = 72 cm Weight = 66 kg Group 2 (Group 1 + Group 3): Length = 18 - 14 = 4 inches, Height = 72 - 50 = 22 cm, Weight = 66 - 20 = 46 kg Group 3 (Group 2 + Group 4): Length = 4 inches, Height = 22 cm, Weight = 46 kg - 10 = 36 kg Group 4 (Group 3 + Group 5): Length = 4 - 2 = 2 inches, Height = 22 - 10 = 12 cm, Weight = 36 kg - 10 = 26 kg Therefore, there are 4 groups of 4 people each.
Response:  Rabia has 99 maunds of rice and wants to distribute it among 3 groups of 5 people each. To calculate how many maunds each group will get, we need to divide the total amount of rice by the number of groups. So, the calculation is as follows: Total amount of rice = 99 maunds Number of groups = 3 Groups per group = 5 people Each group gets = Total amount of rice / Number of groups = 99 maunds / 3 = 33 maunds Therefore, each group will get 33 maunds of rice.
Response:  Rabia has 20 incomes and 6 expenses, so her net worth is $20 - $6 = $14. Since Rabia has more than $14 in assets, let's assume she has $25 in assets. Therefore, there are 25 - 20 = 5 assets that belong to Rabia.
Response:  Rabia has 5 groups of 20 people each, and she wants to divide them into 12 teams of equal size. To find out how many teams she can make, we need to calculate the number of people in each team. We know that there are 5 groups with 20 people each, so the total number of people is 5 x 20 = 100. Since Rabia wants to divide these people into 12 teams, the number of people in each team is 100 / 12 = 8.33 (approximately). Therefore, Rabia can make approximately 9 teams of 8-9 people each.
"Response:  Lok has played one trillion games and earned 154 points in each game. If he had earned 11 points in every round, then he would have earned a total of:

154 x 11 = 1764 points

So, Lok has earned 1764 points in all the rounds he played."
"Response:  Lok has 177 rupees and he wants to distribute them equally among 46 people. So, each person will get:

$$ \frac{177}{46} = 3.89 $$

So, Lok can give 389 paisa to each of the 46 people."
Response:  Lok has made 2 trucks and filled them with 84 pounds of goods each. If he had one truck and filled it with 100 pounds of goods, how many trucks would he need to make to carry all those goods? Solution: To find out how many trucks Lok needs to make, we can divide the total weight of goods (84 x 2 = 168 pounds) by the weight of each truck (100 pounds). This gives us a ratio of 168/100 = 1.68 or approximately 1.7 trucks. So, Lok needs to make approximately 1.7 trucks to carry all the goods.
Response:  If Lakshmi has 146 points in one direction of a square chessboard and she wants to score 157 points, then we need to find out how many points she can gain from that particular direction.  To do this, we will use the fact that each side of the board contains 16 squares. So, if Lakshmi moves her king towards any direction, she will cover either 0, 1, 2,..., or 15 squares (depending on which direction she chooses). Therefore, the maximum number of points she can gain is 15 x 16 = 240 points.  Since Lakshmi already has 146 points, she still needs to gain 94 points more to reach her target of 157 points.
"Response:  If Lucky has 78 points in Trivia Game and he can make 3 moves in each direction (up, down, left or right), then we need to calculate how many positions Lucky can reach with his 78 points.

1. Upward move: In this case, Lucky can reach a maximum of 78 positions since he starts at position 0. So, the number of positions reached upwards is 78.
2. Downward move: Similarly, if Lucky makes a downward move, he can reach a maximum of 78 positions from his current position. Therefore, the number of positions reached downwards is also 78.
3. Leftward move: Now, let's consider the leftward move. Since Lucky has 78 points, he can make 3 moves in this direction, which means he can reach a total of 78 x 3 = 234 positions to the left.
4. Rightward move: Finally, if Lucky makes a rightward move, he can reach a maximum of 78 positions from his current position. Therefore, the number of positions reached to the right is also 78.

So, in summary, Lucky can reach a total of 78 + 78 + 234 + 78 = 658 positions using all four directions (up, down, left, and right) with his 78 points in the Trivia Game."

Response:  According to the given information, Imran has made 11 hairpieces and each hairpiece contains 28 motifs. So, in total, Imran has made 11 x 28 = 308 motifs.
Response:  If there are 8 hair follicles in each of the 20 areas (i.e., 160 hair follicles in total), and each area has 16 hairs (i.e., 320 hairs in total), then we can calculate the number of hairs that Emily can grow per month as follows:  Number of hairs grown = Total number of hair follicles x Number of hairs per follicle x Growth rate per month In this case, the growth rate is assumed to be constant at 1 cm/month. Therefore, the number of hairs grown by Emily per month would be: Number of hairs grown = 160 x 32 x 1 = 5120 hairs So, Emily can grow approximately 5120 hairs per month.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 18 hair follicles in total, and out of them, 6 are dead (motivated). So, the number of live hair follicles is 18 - 6 = 12.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 5 friends and each friend has 5 hairs on their head. So, in total, there are 5 x 5 = 25 hairs. Now, out of these 25 hairs, Emily cut 4 hairs. Therefore, the remaining number of hairs that Emily had after cutting 4 hairs is 25 - 4 = 21 hairs.
Response:  We have 72 friends and we want to give them each a gift of $100. Since there are only 6 motives left after giving gifts to 72 people, each motive will cost $100 / 6 = $16.67. So, Emily can afford to buy 6 motives for her 72 friends.
Response:  We have 43 friends and each of them has 5 motions in their hands (total = 215 motions). Now, we want to know how many motions are required for each hand to hold all these 43 friend's hands? To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of motions by the number of friends whose hands we want to hold (i.e., 43). So, the number of motions required per hand is:  Number of motions per hand = Total number of motions / Number of friends whose hands we want to hold = 215 / 43 = 5  Therefore, each hand needs to hold 5 motions from different people to fulfill the condition given in the question.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 44 friends of Emily and she has made 26 hair buns for them. Each hair bun contains 2 motifs, so in total, Emily has made 52 motifs (2 x 26). Since each motif can be either red or blue, the number of red motifs is half of 52, which is 26. Therefore, the number of blue motifs is also half of 52, which is 26.
Response:  During summer season (June to September), there are 819058 larvae of mosquitoes that survive in the field and 668278 larvae that survive inside homes. So, out of these total larvae, 440736 (819058 - 668278) larvae do not survive in homes during summer season. Therefore, the number of larvae of mosquitoes that survive in homes during summer season is 668278.
Response:  In summer of 2029, there were 202958 larns in the camp and 777622 bachelors at home. Now, let's calculate how many bachelors are staying with their families during this time. To do so, we need to subtract the number of bachelors who went to the camp from the total number of bachelors at home. So, the number of bachelors staying with their families is: 202958 - 777622 = -574614 bachelors. Therefore, out of the total 852310 bachelors, 574614 bachelors are staying with their families during this time.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 students in Larns Konati and during summer vacation, 629424 of them participate in camps outside their homes. So, the number of students who do not go to camp is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627. Therefore, out of 898051 students, 268627 stay at home during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that in summer season (March to June), there are 274865 children who stay at home during the daytime and 313473 children who go out for work during this period.

Response:  According to the given information, there are 907611 babies born in Larans during hot weather and 455682 babies born in cold weather. So, the total number of babies born in Larans is 907611 + 455682 = 1363493 babies.
Response:  During summer vacation, 4000 students go to camp for 3 weeks. So, in total, 4000 x 3 = 12000 students go to camp during summer vacation. Now, out of these 12000 students, 8000 are boys and 4000 are girls. Therefore, there are 8000 boys and 4000 girls who stay at home during summer vacation.
Response:  In summer season (June to September), there are 61 days in total. Out of these, 30 days are spent at home and 31 days are spent outside during the daytime. Therefore, the number of children who went to school during this period is:  Number of days spent outside = 31 days x 24 hours/day = 756 hours Total time spent outside = 756 hours / 60 minutes/hour = 12.58 weeks Now, let's calculate the number of children who went to school during this period: Total number of children = Total time spent outside x Number of children per week = 12.58 weeks x 91676 children/week = 113,344 children So, approximately 113,344 children went to school during the summer season in Larns Kaoonti.
Response:  We know that in summer season, 34044 larvae of certain insect species hatch from eggs and grow into adults. Out of these, only 13486 survive to reach adulthood, while the remaining 20558 do not make it through. Now, let's assume there are X number of bees in the colony. Since each queen bee lays around 1500 eggs per day, we can calculate the total number of eggs laid by all queens in one day as follows: Total eggs laid = Number of queens x Number of eggs laid per queen per day = X x 1500 So, after one day, we have X x 1500 eggs. Now, out of these eggs, only 34044 will hatch into larvae, which means that the percentage of eggs that hatch is: Percentage of eggs that hatch = (Number of eggs that hatch / Total number of eggs) x 100 = (34044 / X x 1500) x 100 = 22.67% Therefore, out of the total number of eggs laid by all queens in one day, approximately 22.67% or 2267 eggs will hatch into larvae.
Response:  According to the given information, during summer season (June to September), out of total 610769 larvae, only 380436 larvae survive and become adult butterflies. So, the number of larvae that do not survive is equal to 610769 - 380436 = 230333. Therefore, the number of larvae that survive in this period is 380436.
Response:  According to the given information, during summer vacation, 644997 children were at home and 893835 children attended camp. So, in total, there are 1538202 children (644997 + 893835). Therefore, the number of children who did not attend camp is 78 (893835 - 1538202).
Response:  We know that there are 10 apples in Edam's basket and 9 apples in Jackie's basket. So, the total number of apples is: 10 + 9 = 19 apples.
Response:  Adm has 10 seeds and Jaki has 2 seeds. To find out how many more seeds Adm has than Jaki, we need to subtract Jaki's seeds from Adm's seeds. So, the difference between Adm's seeds and Jaki's seeds is: 10 - 2 = 8 more seeds. Therefore, Adm has 8 more seeds than Jaki.
"Response:  According to the given information, we have:

Adam has 9 seeds in his pocket.
Jake has 10 seeds in his pocket.
To find out how many more seeds Jake has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of seeds Adam has from the number of seeds Jake has:

Number of seeds Jake has - Number of seeds Adam has = 10 - 9 = 1

So, Jake has 1 more seed than Adam."
"Response:  Jack has 10 seeds in total and Adam has 8 seeds in total. To find out how many more seeds Jack has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of seeds Adam has from the number of seeds Jack has:

Number of seeds Jack has - Number of seeds Adam has = 10 - 8 = 2

So, Jack has 2 more seeds than Adam."
Response:  We know that there are 6 seeds in total (3 from Adam and 3 from Eve). In their respective pairs, they have 4 seeds each. So, the total number of seeds is: 6 + 6 = 12 seeds. Therefore, there are 12 seeds in total.
Response:  Adam and Eve have 9 apples between them. Each of them has 7 apples. So, in total, there are 9 x 7 = 63 apples.
Response:  We have 12 apples and 9 jackets in total.  Out of these, Adam has 4 apples and 3 jackets, while Eve has 8 apples and 6 jackets. So, the number of apples that Adam has is 4, and the number of jackets he has is 3. Similarly, the number of apples that Eve has is 8, and the number of jackets she has is 6. Therefore, there are 4 + 3 = 7 apples with Adam, and 8 + 6 = 14 apples with Eve.
Response:  We know that there are 4 seeds in one jackfruit and 10 seeds in every jute bag. So, if we have 2 jute bags, then the total number of seeds will be:  Number of seeds in one jackfruit = 4 seeds/jackfruit x Total number of jackfruits = 4 x 2 = 8 seeds. Therefore, there are 8 seeds in 2 jute bags.
Response:  We know that there are 5 more seeds in Jackie's bag than in Jill's bag. So, if Jill has x seeds, then Jackie has x + 5 seeds. Since Jill has 89 sunflower seeds and 11 pumpkin seeds, we can write an equation: Jackie has x seeds. Now, we need to find out how many seeds Jackie has. To do this, we divide the number of seeds Jackie has by the number of seeds Jill has: x = 89 (Jill's seeds) / 5 (more seeds in Jackie's bag). Simplifying the fraction, we get: x = 17. Therefore, Jackie has 17 seeds in his bag.

Response:  The cat has 81 dogs as its friends and each dog has 59 kittens. So, in total, the cat has how many kittens?  Solution:  To find out how many kittens the cat has, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the number of kittens each dog has. Therefore, the total number of kittens = Number of dogs x Number of kittens per dog = 81 x 59 = 4769 kittens.
Response:  The total number of friends that Kitui has is 91. Out of these, he considers 88 as his close friends and 53 as his old friends. So, the difference between the total number of friends and the number of close friends is 88 - 53 = 35. Similarly, the difference between the total number of friends and the number of old friends is 91 - 53 = 38. Therefore, there are 35 new friends and 38 old friends of Kitui.
Response:  We know that there are 78 new khilos and 86 old khilos in total. Our friends have taken 48 of them. So, if we divide the number of new khilos (78) by the number of old khilos (86), we get: 78 / 86 = 0.90. Therefore, there are almost 10 new khilos for every one old khilo.
Response:  Kitty has 84 cats and 19 puppies. Her friends have 8 cats and 69 dogs. So, how many cats does she have with her friend? We can find this out by subtracting the number of cats that her friends have from the total number of cats that Kitty has. Therefore, Kitty has 84 - 8 = 76 cats with her friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kitty has 62 cats and 80 dogs.  Now, let's calculate how many puppies each dog gave birth to. Since there are 73 friends of Kitty who have dogs, and each dog gives birth to an average of 5 puppies (as per the given information), then the total number of puppies born is:  Number of dogs = 73 x 5 = 365 puppies Now, let's add this to the total number of animals owned by Kitty: Total number of animals owned by Kitty = 62 cats + 80 dogs + 365 puppies = 519 animals Therefore, there are 519 animals in total owned by Kitty and her friends.
Response:  According to the given information, Kitty has 57 cats and her friends have 63 dogs. So, in total, Kitty has 120 pets (57 x 2 = 120).
Response:  Catty has 57 new kittens and 39 old kittens, so in total she has 96 kittens (57 + 39 = 96). Her friends have bred 34 new kittens, so the total number of kittens among all cats including Catty is 130 (96 + 34 = 130).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Hafeez earned Rs. 60 per hour and worked for 5 hours in the morning. So, he earned Rs. 60 x 5 = Rs. 300 in the morning.  Now, let's consider the afternoon work. We are told that Jaisen earned Rs. 19 per hour and worked for 4 hours in the afternoon. Therefore, he earned Rs. 19 x 4 = Rs. 76 in the afternoon.  Finally, we add up the total earnings of both Hafeez and Jaisen to get the total amount they earned today. So, the total amount they earned today is Rs. 300 + Rs. 76 = Rs. 376.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 in his pocket at first and then he gave $5 to Jesus. So, initially, Fred had $86 - $5 = $81 in his pocket. Now, after Jesus took some money from him, Fred has $81 - $9 = $72 left with him. Therefore, currently, Fred has $72 in his pocket.
Response:  Initially, Fred had Rs. 19 and Jane had Rs. 16. After some time, Fred spent Rs. 8 and now he has Rs. 40 left. Similarly, Jane spent Rs. 4 and now she has Rs. 69 left. So, the difference in their money at the end is: 40 - 69 = (-29) = Rs. 29.
Response:  Initially, there were $114 in Fred's pocket and $22 in Jason's pocket. Now, after all transactions, Fred has $21 left, and Jason has $78 left. So, the difference between what Jason had initially and what he has now is: $\boxed{78 - 22 = 56}$.
Response:  Initially, Fred had Rs. 111 and gave Rs. 79 to Jason. Now, Fred has Rs. 115 and Jason has Rs. 44. So, the difference in money between them is Rs. 76 (Rs. 115 - Rs. 44).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had Rs. 49 in his pocket before he gave Rs. 3 to Jesus. So, now Fred has Rs. 49 - Rs. 3 = Rs. 46 left with him.  Then, we are told that Jesus received Rs. 112 from Fred after giving him Rs. 3. Therefore, the amount of money Jesus had earlier was Rs. 112 - Rs. 3 = Rs. 109.  Now, let's calculate how much money each of them had after the transaction. For Fred, he had Rs. 46 + Rs. 3 = Rs. 49 left with him. And for Jesus, he had Rs. 109 + Rs. 3 = Rs. 112.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had Rs. 78 in his pocket before he gave Rs. 25 to Jesus. So, the amount of money left with Fred after giving it to Jesus is:
Rs. 78 - Rs. 25 = Rs. 53
Now, we are told that Jesus had Rs. 31 in his pocket initially. So, the total amount of money that Jesus had was:
Rs. 31 + Rs. 53 = Rs. 84
Therefore, the difference between the amount of money that Jesus had and the amount of money that Fred had is:
Rs. 84 - Rs. 53 = Rs. 31
So, the correct answer is Rs. 31."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 in his pocket at the beginning of the story and then he lost $16 due to some expenses. So, his remaining amount was $33 - $16 = $17. Now, let's consider what happened next. According to the passage, Jason gave him $95 as a tip, which is more than twice the amount that Fred had left after paying for the expenses. Therefore, the total amount that Fred received from Jason was $95 + $17 = $112. So, the final amount that Fred had in his pocket after receiving the money from Jason was $112.
Response:  Initially, there were $47 in Fred's pocket and $99 in George's pocket. In the last month of this period, Fred gave away $111 as charity and spent $34 on something. So, now Fred has $47 - $111 = $64 left with him. Similarly, George had $99 initially and spent $34 on something, so he has $99 - $34 = $65 left with him. Therefore, the amount of money that is left with both Fred and George together is $64 + $65 = $129.
Response:  Initially, Jasir had a weight of 71 kilograms. He started walking every day and lost 20 kilograms. So, his current weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg.
Response:  If Jasir weighed 87 kg at time 27, and he lost 101 grams per day for 3 days, then his weight after 3 days would be: 87 kg x (1 - 0.1) = 85.9 kg So, Jasir lost approximately 1.1 kg or 110 grams in those 3 days.
Response:  At first, Jabir weighed himself at 126 kg. Then he lost weight and his current weight is 66 kg. So, how much weight did he lose? We can calculate it as follows: 126 - 66 = 60 kg. Therefore, Jabir lost 60 kg of weight.
Response:  If he lost 35 kg in weight, his current weight is 69 kg (as mentioned). So, if he started exercising regularly from today, his weight loss per day would be: 35 kg / 7 days = 5 kg per day. Therefore, after one week, his new weight would be: 69 kg - 5 kg x 7 days = 64 kg.
Response:  On day 1, Jasir reduced his weight by 50 grams. So, he had 114 - 50 = 64 grams of weight left. Then, on days 2-7, he lost an additional 60 grams per day, which means he lost a total of 60 x 7 = 420 grams in those days. Therefore, his current weight is 64 + 420 = 484 grams.
Response:  Jasheer had a weight of 9 kg before he started exercising regularly. He lost 62 grams in the first week and 140 grams in the second week. So, his total weight loss is: 62 + 140 = 202 grams.
Response:  Initially, Jasir had a weight of 92 kilograms. He then started exercising and lost some weight. After 5 days, his weight was 56 kilograms in one group and 99 kilograms in another group. So, after those 5 days, Jasir's total weight loss would be: Total weight loss = Weight before exercise - Weight after exercise = 92 kg - (56 kg + 99 kg) = 37 kg
Response:  We have 95 balls in one container and 61 balls in another container. If we add both containers together, we get 156 balls (95 + 61 = 156). Now, if we take 64 balls from the first container, how many balls will be left in that container? The answer is 91 balls (156 - 64 = 91).
Response:  We have 93 small balls and 97 large balls in one container. If we take out 40 small balls, then the number of small balls left will be: 93 - 40 = 53. Similarly, if we take out 40 large balls, then the number of large balls left will be: 97 - 40 = 57. So, there are 53 small balls and 57 large balls remaining in the container after taking out 80 balls (40 small + 40 large).
Response:  We have 3 sapphires and 75 tamahs in one quffah. If we add 82 sapphires and 19 tamahs to it, then the total number of tamahs will be 82 + 19 = 101 tamahs. So, there are 101 tamahs in the remaining quffah.
Response:  There are 79 people in the room. If 24 of them have sanp and 51 of them have tamasha, then we need to find out how many people don't have either sanp or tamasha. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who have sanp from the total number of people in the room, and then subtract the number of people who have tamasha from that remaining amount. So, the final answer is: Number of people without sanp or tamasha = Total number of people - (Number of people with sanp + Number of people with tamasha) = 79 - (24 + 51) = 24  Therefore, there are 24 people in the room who don't have either sanp or tamasha.
Response:  The farmer has 171 tomatoes in his bag initially. If he gives away 134 tomatoes and keeps 30 for himself, then how many tomatoes will be left with him? So, the number of tomatoes left with the farmer is 171 - 134 = 37.
Response:  Initially, there were 160 tamarinds in the garden of one person. Out of them, 56 tamarinds were picked and now there are 41 tamarinds left in the garden. To find out how many babies (tamarind fruits) were present initially, we need to multiply the total number of tamarinds with the percentage of tamarinds that were picked. So, the initial number of baby tamarinds = Total no. of tamarinds x Percentage of tamarinds picked = 160 x 56/100 = 87 baby tamarinds.
Response:  The person has 90 tomatoes in their garden and they have chosen to sell 154 of them today. So, the number of tomatoes left with the person is: Number of tomatoes left = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes sold = 90 - 154 = 66 tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 175 tomatoes in the garden and 77 aloo (potatoes) too. If he has taken out 172 tomatoes, then how many tomatoes and potatoes are left? Tomato count = 175 - 172 = 3 Tomatoes remaining Potato count = 77 - 0 = 77 Potatoes remaining So, there are 3 tomatoes and 77 potatoes left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there are 177 tomatoes and 12 aloo (potatoes) in the garden of one person. If he has given away 53 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes left with him is: 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes. Similarly, if he has given away 53 aloo, then the number of aloo left with him is: 12 - 53 = -41 aloo. So, the total number of tomatoes and aloo left with the person is: 124 + (-41) = 83 tomatoes and aloo.
Response:  We know that there are 105 green and 71 red tomatoes in one person's garden. If this person has 137 tomato plants, then the number of green tomatoes is:  Green Tomatoes = Number of Plants x Number of Green Tomatos per Plant = 137 x 105 = 14,250 Green Tomatoes Now, let's find out how many red tomatoes are left: Red Tomatoes = Total Tomatoes - Green Tomatoes = 137 - 14,250 = -14,113 Red Tomatoes So, there are -14,113 red tomatoes left in the person's garden.
Response:  We know that there are four walls in the house and each wall has two doors. So, the total number of doors in the house is 4 x 2 = 8 doors.
Response:  We know that there are 13 cats in the house and each cat has 4 kittens. So, the total number of kittens is 13 x 4 = 52 kittens. Now, we need to subtract the number of kittens that have already been spayed or neutered from the total number of kittens. According to the question, 8 kittens have already been spayed or neutered, so the remaining number of kittens is 52 - 8 = 44 kittens. Therefore, there are 44 kittens in the house.
Response:  We know that there are 11 doors in the house and each door has 3 hinges. So, the total number of hinges in the house is 11 x 3 = 33 hinges. Now, we need to calculate how many hinges are required for each big tree. If each big tree requires 8 hinges, then the total number of hinges required for all big trees is 8 x 4 = 32 hinges. Therefore, the remaining 1 hinge is left over after providing 32 hinges for big trees. Hence, the answer is 33 - 32 = 1 hinge.
Response:  The wall has 12 big and 10 small tiles. If we want to cover all of them with paint, each tile will require 15 kilograms of paint. So, in total, we need 180 kilograms (12 x 12 + 10 x 5) of paint for the entire wall.
"Response:  We have to find out how many kilograms of rice are required for 16 people to eat for one day.  Firstly, we need to calculate the amount of rice required per person.  As mentioned in the question, each person requires 200 grams of rice per meal. Therefore, the total amount of rice required for 16 people for one day is:

$$ \text {Total amount of rice required = Number of people x Amount of rice required per person} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Total amount of rice required = 16 x 200 g} $$

Therefore, the total amount of rice required for 16 people to eat for one day is 3200 grams or 3.2 kg (since 1 kg = 1000 grams)."
Response:  If there are 8 big dogs in front of the house and each dog needs 74 kilograms of food per day, then the total amount of food required for all 8 dogs is: 8 x 74 = 592 kilograms. So, the number of tonnes of food required for all 8 dogs is: 592 / 1000 = 0.592 tonnes.
Response:  We have 12 big dogs and 17 small dogs. Each big dog needs 14 kibbles per day, and each small dog needs 25 kibbles per day. So, in total, we need 12 x 14 = 168 kibbles for the big dogs and 17 x 25 = 425 kibbles for the small dogs. Therefore, the total number of kibbles needed is 168 + 425 = 593 kibbles.

Response:  The pigeon had 15 gold coins in its nest but gave away 5 of them to Gandhi. So, there are 10 gold coins left in the nest.
Response:  The person had 43 seeds in front of him and he planted 2 seeds per pot. So, he planted 43 / 2 = 21 pots.
Response:  We know that initially there were 58 seeds in the bag and after using 35 of them, 23 seeds are left. So, the number of seeds remaining in the bag is 23.
Response:  Initially, there were 40 apples and 54 pears in the basket. After shifting some of them, 39 remained in the basket. So, the number of apples that Shifu shifted = Number of remaining apples - Initial number of apples = 39 - 40 = -1 apple. Therefore, Shifu did not shift any apple.
Response:  There are 11 shelves in each of the two rooms, and each shelf can hold 4 boxes or 40 marbles. So, there are 11 x 2 = 22 shelves in total. Each shelf can hold either 4 boxes or 40 marbles, so the total number of boxes or marbles that can be placed on all 22 shelves is 22 x 4 = 88. Therefore, there can be at most 88 boxes or marbles in both rooms combined.
"Response:  If there are 10 exercises in each category and we have to arrange them in our rooms, then the total number of exercises will be:

10 x 4 = 40 exercises

So, there are 40 exercises in all."
Response:  There are 8 action figures and 10 cabinets in each of Edam's rooms. Therefore, there are a total of 8 x 3 = 24 action figures and 10 x 3 = 30 cabinets in all three rooms combined. So, there are 24 + 30 = 54 objects in all three rooms together.
Response:  We have 10 bags of wheat and each bag contains 544 grains. So, total number of grains in all 10 bags is : 10 x 544 = 5440 grains. Now we need to find out how many grains are there in each bag. Since each bag contains 32 phuls, so total number of grains in one bag is : 5440 / 32 = 170 grains per bag. Therefore, there are 170 grains in each of the 10 bags.
Response:  We have 466 balls in total. Each ball has 53 red seeds and 181 white seeds. So, the total number of red seeds is 53 x 466 = 24,796. Similarly, the total number of white seeds is 181 x 466 = 86,066. Therefore, there are more white seeds than red seeds.
Response:  We have 141 balls in total. Each ball has either 71 or 91 seeds inside it. So, the number of seeds inside each ball is: (71 + 91) / 2 = 80 seeds per ball. Therefore, there are 80 seeds in each of the 141 balls.
Response:  We have 400 apples in total and we want to distribute them equally among 40 boxes. So, each box will contain 10 apples (400/40 = 10).
Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in total and 4276 of them are regular Skittles. If we divide the regular Skittles into 154 groups, then each group will have approximately 28 Skittles ( = 4276 / 154).
Response:  We know that there are 3941 erasers in total and 4950 rubbers are available if we group them into 495 groups of equal size. So, each group contains $\frac{4950}{495} = 10$ erasers on average. Therefore, each group has $10 \times 495 = 4950$ erasers in total.
Response:  There are 896 skittles in total. If we divide them into 8 groups of equal size (which is not possible), each group would have 109 skittles (896 / 8 = 109). However, since there are only 517 reizers and 90 tazos, it means that some groups will have more than 109 skittles each. So, to answer your question directly, no group has exactly 109 skittles.
Response:  There are 270 students in the school and each grade has 5 students. So, there are total 270 / 5 = 54 grades in the school.
Response:  Number of classes = 304 Classes per class = 75 students/class Total number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,500 students
