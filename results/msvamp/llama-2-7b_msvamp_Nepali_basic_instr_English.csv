Explanation:
If there are 365 days in a year and each day has 8 hours, then there are 365 x 8 = 2970 hours in a year. If we subtract the number of hours spent sleeping (which is assumed to be 6 hours per day), then we have 2970 - 6 = 2964 hours available for work or other activities.
Since there are 365 days in a year, we can calculate the average number of working hours per day as follows:
Average daily working hours = Total working hours / Number of days
= 2964 / 365
= 8.1 hours/day
Therefore, if Jeremy works for 120 days straight without any breaks, he will have worked for an total of 8.1 x 120 = 972 hours during that period."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented in the following table:

| Number of balls | Weight (in kg) |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | 0.45 |
| 20 | 0.9 |
| 30 | 1.35 |
| 40 | 1.8 |
| 50 | 2.25 |
| 60 | 2.7 |
| 70 | 3.15 |
| 80 | 3.6 |
| 90 | 4.05 |
| 100 | 4.5 |

From the table, we can see that if 10 balls weighing 0.45 kg each are placed in a bag, then the weight of the bag will be 4.5 kg. Similarly, if 20 balls weighing 0.9 kg each are placed in a bag, then the weight of the bag will be 1.8 kg. Therefore, if 45 balls weighing 0.45 kg each are placed in a bag, then the weight of the bag will be 21 kg (45 x 0.45 = 21).

Similarly, if 11 balls weighing 0.45 kg each are placed in a bag, then the weight of the bag will be 4.55 kg (11 x 0.45 = 4.55). So, the difference between the weight of the bag with 45 balls and the weight of the bag with 11 balls is 16.45 kg (21 - 4.55 = 16.45)."

Explanation:
The distance between two points in a straight line is calculated using the formula: Distance = √(Sum of squares of differences between corresponding coordinates).
In this case, we have two sets of coordinates:
Coordinate set 1: (0, 0), (3, 4)
Coordinate set 2: (17, 0), (29, 4)
To find the distance between these two coordinate sets, we need to calculate the difference between each pair of corresponding coordinates and then square them. Finally, we take the square root of the sum of these squared differences to get the total distance.
So, the distance between the two coordinate sets is:
Distance = √((0 - 17)^2 + (3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 0)^2) = √(56 + 9 + 16) = √71 = 8.57
Therefore, the distance between the two points is approximately 8.57 meters."

Total value = Books + Notes = Rs 1900 + Rs 1530 = Rs 3430
Now, let's find out how many books and notes each person got:
Number of people = Total value / (Price of one book + Price of one note)
= Rs 3430 / (Rs 20 + Rs 10)
= 135

Now, let's find out how many sets of 113 books and 19 notebooks are possible with the total number of items:
Number of sets = Total number of items / (Number of books per set + Number of notebooks per set)
= 731 / (113 + 19) = 60
Therefore, the number of sets that can be made is 60."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 20 vats of water stored in Helie's house. If one vat is equal to 40 liters, then the total amount of water stored in the house is 20 x 40 = 800 liters. Since there are 36 vats of water in the backyard, and each vat contains 40 liters of water, the total amount of water in the backyard is 36 x 40 = 1440 liters. Therefore, the difference between the total amount of water in the house and the total amount of water in the backyard is 800 - 1440 = -640 liters. As there is no negative quantity of water, the answer must be 0 liters."

Response: 44/25 = 1.76
"Response:  The number of days it would take to cut down 50 trees with a diameter of 3 feet each and 74 trees with a diameter of 2 feet each is:

For 50 trees with a diameter of 3 feet each:
Total volume of wood = π x (3 ft)² x 50 trees = 150 cubic feet
Time taken to cut one tree = 150 / (60 min/hr) = 2.5 hours per tree
Number of hours required to cut all 50 trees = 50 x 2.5 = 125 hours

For 74 trees with a diameter of 2 feet each:
Total volume of wood = π x (2 ft)² x 74 trees = 148 cubic feet
Time taken to cut one tree = 148 / (60 min/hr) = 2.4 hours per tree
Number of hours required to cut all 74 trees = 74 x 2.4 = 179 hours"

Response:  If they sold 47 t-shirts during Arkansas game and made $87 per t-shirt, then they made a total of $4091 in revenue from selling t-shirts during that game.
"Response: 243
Explanation:
The total number of t-shirts sold by each player in Arkansas and Texas games is given as 242 for Arkansas and 115 for Texas. Since there are two players playing, we need to double the number of t-shirts sold by each player to get the total number of t-shirts sold overall. Therefore, the total number of t-shirts sold overall is 2 x (242 + 115) = 486 t-shirts."
Response:  If each player in Arkansas and Texas played for an average of 89 minutes per game, and they sold 163 T-shirts during their games, then they would have earned $980 in total.
Response: 1720
"Response: 183 T-shirts and 31 jeans were sold at an average price of $62 for each T-shirt and $99 for each pair of jeans. Therefore, the total revenue generated from these sales is:

Total Revenue = Number of items sold x Average selling price
= 183 T-shirts x $62
+ 31 jeans x $99
= $11,573 + $3049
= $14,622

So, the total revenue generated from these sales was $14,622."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Arkansas and Texas sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jeans respectively during a certain time period. Therefore, the total amount of money made by both states combined is $74 x 74 = $5,396 and $156 x 156 = $24,800. So, Arkansas made $5,396 and Texas made $24,800.
Response:  The price of each T-shirt increased by $19 and the price of each jeans decreased by $34. So, if you bought 157 T-shirts and 19 jeans before, now you can buy 128 T-shirts and 13 jeans with the same amount of money. Therefore, the price of one T-shirt increased by $69 ($19 x 3) and the price of one jeans decreased by $20 ($34 x 2).
Response:  The price of each T-shirt increased by $86 and the price of each jeans decreased by $232. So, if one buys 254 T-shirts and 43 jeans, they will have to pay $2,097,200 in total. If one buys only one T-shirt, its price will be $86 more than the original price, which is $86 + $23 = $109.
Response: 13000

Response: 60
Response: 215 dollars
"Response:  $215

Explanation:
The cost of one T-shirt is $20 and that of one pair of jeans is $30. If Arkansas sells 20 T-shirts and Texas sells 64 pairs of jeans, then the total revenue generated by both states will be:

Arkansas's revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt = 20 x $20 = $400
Texas's revenue = Number of pairs of jeans sold x Price per pair = 64 x $30 = $1920
Total revenue = Arkansas's revenue + Texas's revenue = $400 + $1920 = $2150
Therefore, the amount of money made by both states combined is $2150."
Response:  $1580 (seventy-six T-shirts x $204 per T-shirt + two Jerseys x $204 per Jersey)
Response:  The price of one T-shirt increased by $210 and that of each pair of jeans by $40 due to Arkansas and Texas taxes. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling 177 T-shirts and 33 pairs of jeans is $35,980. If we consider the price of one T-shirt before taxes was $21, then after taxes it became $42 ($21 x 1.8 = $42).
Response:  The price of each T-shirt increased by $15 and the price of each pair of jeans increased by $25. So, the new prices are: T-shirts - $38 (instead of $23), Jeans - $63 (instead of $38).
