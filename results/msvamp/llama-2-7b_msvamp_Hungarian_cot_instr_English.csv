Response:  On Monday (hétfő), Julia played with 18 children. On Friday (kedden), she played with 10 children. So, to find out how many children Julia played with on Monday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Friday from the total number of children she played with on Monday: 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, Julia played with 8 children on Monday.;
Response:  On Monday (hétfő), Julia played with 11 children. On Friday (kedden), she played with 12 children. So, to find out how many children Julia played with on Friday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from 12: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with 1 child more on Friday than she did on Monday.;
Response:  If Julia played with 5 children on Monday and then played with some more children on Tuesday (not necessarily all of them), that means she played with a total of 5 + x children, where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Since we know that the total number of children she played with was 15, we can set up the equation: 5 + x = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. So Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday.;
"Response:  If Julia played with 7 children on Monday (hétfőn), and she played with 14 children on Friday (kedden), then we can say that she played with x number of children on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Since there are 5 days in total, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 7 + 14 = 16
Now let's solve for x:
x = 16 - 21 = -5
So Julia played with 5 children on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday.";
Response:  If there were 16 children in the team on Monday and 7 children played with Julia on Monday, then the number of children who did not play with Julia on Monday is 16 - 7 = 9.  Therefore, the number of children who played with Julia on Tuesday (yesterday) is 9.;

"Response:  If Bobby initially had n cukorkák and then ate m more, he will have (n + m) cukorkák in total. Since he ate 25 more after having some initial number of cukorkák, we can write an equation as follows:

(n + m) = 43... (1)

Now, we need to solve for n. We know that m is equal to 25, so we can substitute this value into equation (1):

n + 25 = 43

Subtracting 25 from both sides gives us:

n = 18

Therefore, Bobby initially had 18 cukorkák.";
Response:  First, Bobby had 28 candy sticks and then he ate another 42. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 candy sticks. Then, he also ate 63 chocolates. Therefore, the final answer is 70 (candy sticks) + 63 (chocolates) = 133.;
Response:  First, Bobby ate 33 candy pieces. Then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 37 candy pieces (33 + 4). Next, he ate 14 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 37 + 14 = 51.;
Response:  First, Bobby had 38 marshmallows and ate 36 of them. So he has 2 marshmallows left. Then, he ate 16 chocolates. So, in total, Bobby ate 52 marshmallows (2 + 36) and 16 chocolates. Therefore, he still has 38 - 52 = -14 marshmallows left.;
Response:  First, Bobby evett 20 cukorkát. Then he evett another 34 cukorkát. Finally, he added 18 more to that total. So, in total, Bobby evett 62 cukorkát (20 + 34 + 18).;
Response:  Bobby initially had 21 candy sticks and ate 5 of them. So he has 21 - 5 = 16 left. Then he ate another 9 candy sticks, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 left now. Therefore, there are 7 candy sticks left.;
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some and then he ate 5 more. So, at this point, Bobby has eaten a total of 22 + 5 = 27 candies. If there were initially 8 candy pieces left, then after Bobby ate his share, there are now 8 - 27 = -19 candy pieces left. Therefore, Bobby ate 27 candies in total.;
Response:  Bobby had 19 candy sticks initially and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 19 - 2 = 17 candies left.;
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some with cocaine, then he has less than 32 pieces of candy left.  We know that after eating some candy, he still has 20 pieces of candy left. So, we can conclude that Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy (32 - 20 = 12).;
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 candy sticks (cukorkák). Then he ate 17 of them. So, he has 36 - 17 = 19 left. Later, he ate another 15 candy sticks. Now, he has 19 - 15 = 4 remaining candy sticks. Therefore, there are 4 candy sticks left with Bobby.;

Response:  Allan has brought 3 balls to the park and Jake has brought 2 balls to the park. So, there are more balls with Allan than with Jake at the park. The difference between their number of balls is 1 (Allan - 3 = Jake - 2). Therefore, the correct answer is 1.;
"Response:  We know that Allan had 2 balls and Jake had 3 balls in total. So, to find out how many more balls Jake has than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balls Allan has from the number of balls Jake has. Therefore, the answer is:
Jake has 3 - 2 = 1 more ball than Allan in the park.";
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balls to the park and Jake brought 3 balls to the park, then together they have 5 balls in the park (2 + 3 = 5). So, Jake brought 3 balls to the park.;
Response:  If Jake has brought 4 balls to the park and he brought more than Allen did, then we know that Jake brought at least as many balls as Allen brought. So, if Allen brought x balls to the park, then Jake brought at least x + 4 balls. Therefore, the number of balls Jake brought is equal to x + 4.;
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 balls more than Allan, then Jake brought a total of 6 + 5 = 11 balls to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 11 balls to the park.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan threw 3 balls into the park and Jake threw 5 balls into the park. So, in total, there are 8 balls (3 + 5) in the park now. Then, Allan took two more balls from the park, so now there are 6 balls left in the park (8 - 2). Therefore, the final number of balls that Allan and Jake had in the park is 6 + 5 = 11 balls.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan had 2 balls and Jake had 4 balls in total. Then, Allan took another 3 balls from the park. So, now we have to find out how many more balls Allan has than Jake. To do this, we can divide the number of balls Allan has (5) by the number of balls Jake has (7).  Therefore, there are 5 - 7 = -2 balls more with Allan than with Jake at the park.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan had 2 balls in the park and then he took another 3 balls from the park. So, the total number of balls Allan had is 2 + 3 = 5 balls. Now, we need to find out how many balls Jake had initially in the park. We are told that Jake had 6 balls in the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls Allan had and the number of balls Jake had is: 5 - 6 = -1 balls. So, Jake had fewer balls than Allan in the park.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan brought 5 balls to the park ( Öt ballont hozott). Then, Jake brought 4 balls to the park (Négyet a parkba). Finally, Allan took 3 more balls from the park (Vett még 3 ballont a parkban), so in total he brought 5 + 4 = 9 balls to the park. Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  We know that Allan had 5 balls in the park and Jake took 2 balls from the park. So, at this point, there are 5 - 2 = 3 balls left in the park. Then, Jake took another 3 balls from the park, so now there are 0 balls left in the park. Therefore, Allan had more balls than Jake in the park. The difference between their number of balls is 5 - 2 = 3.;
"Response: 
Allen has brought 3 balls to the park (Jake said he had 3). So Allen has 3 balls in total. 
Then Jake went and got 4 more balls from the park. Now Jake has 7 balls (3 + 4 = 7).  Therefore, Jake has 7 balls more than Allen in the park.";
Response:  Allan brought 5 balls to the park and then Jake took 3 more balls from the park. So, in total, Jake brought 8 balls (5 + 3) to the park.;
Response:  We know that Allan hit 3 balls into the park and scored 20 goals. So, he had 20/3 = 6 chances to score a goal. Since he scored 6 times, his success rate is 6/3 = 2.  Now, let's consider Jake. He hit 5 balls into the park and scored 59 goals. So, he had 59/5 = 11.8 chances (rounded up to 12) to score a goal. Therefore, Jake has more chances than Allan to score a goal in the park.;
Response:  We know that Allan has 7 balls and 5 goals in total. So he has 7 + 5 = 12 objects in his bag. Similarly, we know that Jake has 6 balls and 4 goals in total. So he has 6 + 4 = 10 objects in his bag. Now, let's compare how many objects each person has in their bag to find out who has more. Since Allan has 12 objects and Jake has 10 objects, it means that Allan has more objects than Jake. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) More than Jake.;
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls and he brings them to the park with him, then he already has 5 balls at the park.  Now, if Jake also brings some balls to the park, let's say 1 ball, then together they have 5 + 1 = 6 balls at the park. So, Jake brought 1 ball to the park.;
"Response: 
Allen brought two balls to the park and then took three more from there. So Allen had five balls in total (2 + 3 = 5).  If Jake also brought six balls to the park, then Jake had six times as many balls as Allen did. Therefore, Jake had 30 balls in total (6 x 5 = 30).";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, if we subtract 2 hours (the time spent studying Chinese) from 6 hours (the time spent studying English), we get 4 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours more studying English than Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese.

"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and some other time studying Chinese, then he must spend x hours studying Chinese per day. Since he studies for a total of 4 hours per day (including both languages), we can write an equation as follows:
x + 3 = 4...(1)
Now, let's solve for x in terms of hours per day:
x = 4 - 3...(2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day studying Chinese.";
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and some additional time studying Chinese, then he must spend more than 5 hours (7 - 5 =) studying Chinese. So, Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese.;
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and some additional time studying English. If he spends more than 2 hours studying English than Chinese, then we can say that he spends x hours studying English where x is greater than 2. So, the total number of hours Ryan spends studying English is equal to 5 - 2 = 3 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours studying English.;
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 6 hours and Chinese for 7 hours per day, then he will study English for 30 hours (6 x 5) and Chinese for 49 hours (7 x 5). So in total, Ryan will spend 79 hours studying both languages during these 5 days (30 + 49 = 79).;
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 6 hours per day and Chinese for 5 hours per day, then he spends a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours studying each day.  Therefore, if he studies for two days (2 x 11 = 22 hours).;
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours per day, then he spends 9 hours (5 + 4) studying each day.  Since he will study for 6 days, he will spend a total of 54 hours (9 x 6) studying Chinese in those 6 days.;
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 4 hours per day and Chinese for 6 hours per day, then he spends total of 10 hours (4 + 6) studying every day.  Since he has studied for 86 days, he has spent a total of 860 hours (10 x 86) studying altogether. So, his daily study time is 860/86 = 10 hours per day.;
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English, so he spends x hours studying Chinese and Spanish. Since he spends more time studying Chinese than Spanish, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 6 - 3 = 3
So Ryan spends 3 hours studying Chinese and 3 hours studying Spanish.";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 3 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he has spent a total of 9 hours (6 + 3) studying languages. Now, we need to find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying languages:  Number of hours studying English - Number of hours studying Chinese = 9 - 3 = 6 hours So, Ryan spends 6 hours more studying English than Chinese.;
Response:  Ryan spent 7 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he studied English for 7 + 2 = 9 hours. Now, we know that he studied Spanish for 4 hours. So, the difference between the time he spent studying Spanish and the time he spent studying English is 4 - 9 = -5 hours. That means he did not spend any time studying Spanish.;
Response:  Ryan studies English for 2 hours per day. He studies Chinese for 5 hours per day and Spanish for 4 hours per day. So, in total he spends time studying languages as follows:  Chinese - 5 + 5 = 10 hours/day Spanish - 4 + 4 = 8 hours/day Now we need to find out how many more hours Ryan spends studying Chinese than Spanish. To do this, we subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese: 10 (hours spent studying Chinese) - 8 (hours spent studying Spanish) = 2 hours/day Therefore, Ryan spends 2 hours more studying Chinese than Spanish.;
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours total studying English and Chinese, then he must spend x hours studying English and (3 - x) hours studying Chinese. Since he studies English for 2 hours per day, we can write an equation as follows:

Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. So, if we divide the number of red apples by the number of green apples, we get: Number of red apples / Number of green apples = 17/16 = 1 Therefore, there is one red apple for every two green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. So, if we divide the number of green apples by the number of red apples, we get: Number of green apples = 11 / 5 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 green apples for every red apple in the basket.;
"Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the basket. If we assume that the number of green apples is x, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of red apples = 10
Number of green apples + Number of red apples = Total number of apples (15)
x + 10 = 15
Solving for x, we get:
x = 5
So, there are 5 green apples in the basket.";
Response:  We know that there are three red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are ten green apples in total, then the number of green apples minus the number of red apples is equal to the total number of apples in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of green apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples  In this case, the number of red apples is 3, so we can substitute this value into the equation:  Number of green apples = Total number of apples - 3  Now, we need to find out how many apples are in the basket altogether. According to the problem statement, there are 10 green apples in total. Therefore, the total number of apples in the basket is:  Total number of apples = Number of green apples + Number of red apples  Substituting the values we have found, we get:  Total number of apples = 10 + 3  = 13  Finally, we can use our earlier equation to solve for the number of green apples:  Number of green apples = Total number of apples - Number of red apples  Number of green apples = 13 - 3  = 10  Therefore, there are 10 green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 red, 15 yellow and 8 green grapes in the basket. So, we can write this information as follows: 7R + 15Y + 8G = Total number of grapes in the basket. Now let's calculate each term separately:  Number of red grapes (7): 7 x 1 = 7  Number of yellow grapes (15): 15 x 1 = 15  Number of green grapes (8): 8 x 1 = 8 Therefore, the total number of grapes in the basket is: 7R + 15Y + 8G = 7 + 15 + 8 = 20. So, there are 20 grapes in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 7 yellow apples in the basket.  Since each apple is either red or yellow, we can conclude that there are 7 + 7 = 14 apples in total in the basket. Now, we want to find out how many green apples there are relative to the red ones. So, if there are x green apples, then the ratio of green to red apples is x/7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x/7 = (8 - 7)/(7 + 7) = 1/2. Solving for x, we get x = 6. So, there are 6 green apples in the basket relative to the red ones.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 yellow bananas and 2 red bananas in the basket. If we subtract the number of red bananas from the total number of bananas, we get 6 + 2 = 8. So, there are 8 bananas left after subtracting the red ones. Now, let's find out how many green bananas are left after subtracting the yellow ones. There are 14 green bananas initially. If we subtract the number of yellow bananas (6) from the total number of green bananas, we get 14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 green bananas left in the basket after subtracting both the red and yellow ones.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 black peppers in total and 11 of them are black. So, we have to find out how many black peppers are not black. Therefore, we subtract 11 from 19, which gives us 8. Now, we know that among these 8 remaining peppers, 3 are green. So, we add 3 to 8, which gives us 11. Finally, we can say that there are 11 red peppers in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 90 yellow apples in the basket. Since we want to find out how many red and green apples are in the basket, let's use the information given in the question. The total number of apples is 6 + 90 = 96. Now, if we divide the total number of apples into red and green apples, we get: Red apples = 6/96 = 1/16 Green apples = 90/96 = 5/8 Therefore, there are 1/16 or 6 red apples and 5/8 or 40 green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket. So, the total number of apples is 18 + 14 = 32. Now, we need to find out how many red and yellow apples are there in the basket. Since there are 18 red apples, then the number of yellow apples must be 32 - 18 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 yellow apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 14 green apples in the basket. So, we can write this as: 5R + 14G = X, where R represents the number of red apples and G represents the number of green apples. Now, we also know that there are 6 yellow apples in the basket. Therefore, we can add them to our equation: 5R + 14G + 6Y = X. Solving for Y, we get: Y = X - (5R + 14G). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Y = X - (5(5) + 14(14)) = X - (25 + 190) = -165. So, there are -165 yellow apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 65 baskets of peppers in total. Each basket contains 7 red and 3 green peppers. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of peppers = Number of red peppers + Number of green peppers. In this case, the total number of peppers is equal to 65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 peppers. Therefore, there are 650 peppers in each basket.;

7 kosárok x 2 green bananas/kosár = 14 green bananas

Therefore, there are 14 green bananas in all the kosárok combined.";
Response:  We know that there are 5 baskets and each basket contains 4 red apples and 3 green apples. So, in total, we have 5 x 4 = 20 red apples and 5 x 3 = 15 green apples. Since there are 7 apples in total, we can conclude that there must be 20 + 15 = 35 apples in all the baskets together. Therefore, there are 35/5 = 7 baskets of apples.;
"Response:  We know that there are two baskets and each basket contains 4 red apples and some green apples. If we assume that the number of green apples in each basket is x, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of red apples = 4 (from both baskets)
Total number of apples = Number of red apples + Number of green apples
= 4 + x

Since there are 12 apples in total, we can set up the following inequality:

4 + x <= 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, there are 8 green apples in each basket.";
Response:  We know that there are 16 balls in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we have some green balls as well, then the number of green balls is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green barsacks in the basket.;
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples and 4 green apples in each of the 15 baskets. So, in total, there are:

19 x 15 = 285 red apples
4 x 15 = 60 green apples

So, altogether, there are 285 + 60 = 345 apples in all 15 baskets.";
"Response:  We know that there are 10 baracks in total and they are divided equally among some baskets. Since we don't know how many baskets there are, let's assume that each basket contains an equal number of baracks (i.e., 4 red and 6 green). Therefore, the number of baracks in each basket is:

Baracks per basket = Total baracks / Number of baskets
= 10 / x
where x is the number of baskets.
Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4 (the number of red baracks):
x = 10 / 4
= 2.5
So, there are 2.5 baskets of baracks.";
Response:  We know that there are 6 green apples and 2 red apples in the basket. If we divide the total number of apples (8) by the number of red apples (2), we get the ratio of green to red apples: $ \frac{8}{2} = 4 $$ So, there are 4 green apples for every red apple in the basket. Therefore, if there are 6 green apples, then there are 6 x 4 = 24 green apples in total.;
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures at first in his room. Later, he added some more to the collection. If they have a total of 8 action figures now, that means Jerry initially had 4 and then added 4 more later. So, the answer is 4 + 4 = 8.;
Response:  We know that Jerry had some action figures on his desk at home and later added more to it. So, let's assume he has x action figures initially. Then, he adds 7 more, so now he has x + 7 action figures in total. Since we are told that there were 10 action figures in total, we can set up the equation: x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures on his desk initially and later added 7 more, making a total of 10 action figures.;
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his room initially. Later, he added 6 more action figures to the pile. So, the total number of action figures that Jerry had was: 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf at home. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the pile. So, how many more action figures were there than books? We can calculate this as follows: Number of action figures = 5 + 7 = 12 Number of books = 9 Therefore, there were 12 action figures more than the number of books on Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry had two action figures and ten books in his room. Later, he added four more action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 2 + 10 = 12 items on the shelf. Then, Jerry added another 4 action figures, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 items on the shelf. Therefore, there were 16 books still left on the shelf after adding the new action figures.;
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. Later, he added another 10 books to the pile. So, the total number of books on the pile is:  Initially, there were 8 + 9 = 17 books on the pile. Then, Jerry added another 10 books, so the final total is: 17 + 10 = 27 books. Therefore, there were 27 books on the pile altogether.;
Response:  Jerry had seven action figures and two books on his shelf at home. Later, he added four more books to the shelf. So, in total, how many action figures were there compared to the number of books on the shelf?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of action figures = 7 Books on the shelf = 2 + 4 = 6 Therefore, there were three times as many action figures as books on Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is:  Initially, there were 5 + 2 = 7 items on the shelf. Then, Jerry added 9 more items, so the final number of items on the shelf is: 7 + 9 = 16 items. Therefore, there were 16 books on the shelf in addition to the 5 action figures.;
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed 5 old ones. So, at the end of the day, how many action figures did Jerry have on his shelf?  We can use the information given in the question to calculate this:  Initially, Jerry had 8 action figures + (4 new action figures) = 12 action figures on his shelf. Therefore, Jerry had 12 action figures on his shelf at the end of the day.;
Response:  We know that Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones. If there are now 6 action figures on the shelf, then we can deduce that Jerry removed 3 - 4 = 1 action figure from the shelf originally. So, Jerry took 1 action figure off the shelf.;
Response:  If Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf and then added some more later, that means he has a total of 7 + x action figures where x is the number of additional action figures he added.  Since he removed 10 old action figures from the shelf, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 7 + x - 10 = 7 + x/2. So, there are x/2 action figures on the shelf after Jerry added some more and removed some old ones.;
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added two more action figures and removed seven old ones from the shelf. If Jerry has 10 action figures on the shelf now, that means there were x action figures on the shelf initially. Since Jerry removed seven old action figures, we can say that x - 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 3. So, Jerry had three action figures on the shelf initially.;
Response:  Jerry had 9 action figures in his room initially and later added 7 more. If he has 10 books on his shelf, that means he has 10 x 9 = 90 action figures in total (including the initial 9). So, there are still 90 action figures left after adding the additional 7. Therefore, the correct answer is 90.;
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures at home. Later, he added two more action figures to the pile. So, in total, there were how many action figures more than books at his place?  Solution:  Books = 3 + 2 (new ones) = 5 Action figures = 4 + 2 = 6 Therefore, there were 6 action figures more than books at Jerry's place.;
Response:  Jerry had seven books and three action figures on his bookshelf initially. Later, he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, there were nine objects in total (seven books + three action figures + two new action figures). Therefore, the number of books left on the shelf was seven - three = four books.;
Response:  We know that initially two birds were sitting on the fence (2). Then more birds joined them (4), so in total there are now 6 birds on the fence (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, 4 birds are still sitting on the fence.;
Response:  At first, there were some birds on the fence (we don't know how many). Then, four more birds joined them. So, in total, we have 5 birds on the fence. Therefore, 3 birds were already on the fence at the beginning.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 birds and 46 crabs sitting on the fence initially. If 6 more birds join them, then we have: Birds = 4 + 6 = 10. So, there are 10 birds sitting on the fence in total.;
Response:  We have three birds and two crows already sitting on the fence. If five more birds join them, then there will be eight birds in total (3 + 2 + 5 = 8). So, we can say that seven birds and one crow are sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that three birds and four frogs are already sitting on the fence. If two more birds join them, then there will be... (3 + 2 =)...birds in total on the fence. And we want to know how many of these birds are gulls. So, the answer is: (4/5) x 9 = 10 gulls.;
Response:  We have two birds and six Gypsies sitting on the fence initially. If three more birds join them, then there will be five birds in total (including the initial two). Now, we need to find out how many Gypsies are left on the fence after the birds arrive. Since there were originally six Gypsies, if three more birds join them, then there will be nine Gypsies remaining on the fence (since each bird joined by three Gypsies). Therefore, the final answer is 9 - 6 = 3 additional Gypsies beyond the original number of Gypsies who were already on the fence.;
Response:  We have four birds and six crayfish sitting on the fence. If two more gypsies join them, then we will have... (4 + 6) = 10 gypsies in total. So, there are 10 gypsies on the fence.;
Response:  We have three birds and four cigarettes sitting on the fence initially. If six more gypsies join them, then we will have: 3 + 6 = 9 birds and cigarettes sitting on the fence. So, there are nine birds and cigarettes sitting on the fence in total.;
Response:  We have 6 birds and 3 geese sitting on the fence. If we add two more gypsies who joined them, then the total number of people (including the birds) is 6 + 2 = 8. So there are 8 individuals in total - 3 geese and 5 humans. Therefore, the ratio of birds to geese is 3:5 or 1:2.;
Response:  We have four birds and three gypsies sitting on the fence initially. If six more gypsies join them, then we have ten people (four birds + three gypsies + six new gypsies) sitting on the fence in total. So, there are five people (ten - four = five) who are not birds. Therefore, there are five non-bird people sitting on the fence, which is equal to the number of cigars minus the number of birds. Hence, the answer is five.;
Response:  We have: * 1 hat (madár) + 4 other birds = 5 birds in total. + 8 gypsies who joined them = 13 people in total. So there are 13 people sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have two birds (the starter) and then five more birds join them, making it six in total. Then four gypsies join them, making it ten in total. So, there are ten birds sitting on the fence, including the two starters - which means that three of them are gulls.;
"Response:  We have three birds and two more join them, so there are five birds in total. Then we add six Cigans (as per the question) to the mix, making it a total of eleven individuals on the fence. So, the difference between the number of birds and the number of Cigans is:
$$\boxed{11 - 3 = 8}$$
Therefore, there are eight Cigans on the fence besides the three birds.";
Response:  We have 5 animals in total: 3 birds and 2 dogs. The number of birds is equal to the number of dogs plus 1 (since there is one more bird than dog). So we can write: Birds = Dogs + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 birds sitting on the fence, including the goose.;
"Response:  We know that there are 6 birds and 3 more birds join them later. So, in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds on the fence. Now, let's find out how many gypsies (Cigánys) are present on the fence. According to the question, ""Mindannyian cigánys"" means all of them, so we can write it as Cigánys = 9. Therefore, the number of gypsies is equal to the number of birds, i.e., Cigánys = Birds.";
Response:  We have three birds and six gypsies initially. Then two more birds join them, so now we have three +2 = five birds. However, there are still six gypsies, so the total number of non-bird creatures is six. Therefore, the difference between the number of birds and non-bird creatures is five - six = negative one. So, there is one fewer gypsy than bird on the fence.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 59 (48 + 11). Now, let's find out how many pages are in the first chapter compared to the second chapter. We can see from the question that the first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. Therefore, the ratio of the number of pages in the first chapter to the number of pages in the second chapter is 48 : 11 = 4 : 1. So, for every page in the second chapter, there are 4 pages in the first chapter. Hence, if the second chapter has 11 pages, then the first chapter has 4 x 11 = 44 pages.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 117 (37 + 80). Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter compared to the first chapter. We can do this by dividing the number of pages in the second chapter (80) by the number of pages in the first chapter (37):  Number of pages in the second chapter relative to the first chapter = 80 / 37 = 2.16 or approximately 2 and a half pages. Therefore, the second chapter contains approximately 2 and a half pages more than the first chapter.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 93. Since there are two chapters, each chapter has an equal number of pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter can be found as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages / 2 = 93 / 2 = 46.5 pages So, the second chapter has approximately 47 pages.;
Response:  We know that the book has two chapters and the second chapter is 36 pages long. So, if we divide the total number of pages (67) by the number of chapters (2), we get: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 67 / 2 = 33.5 pages per chapter Since there are 36 pages in the second chapter, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second chapter = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, the first chapter has 31 pages.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three sections in the book. So, the total number of pages is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each section. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Total pages = Number of pages in first section + Number of pages in second section + Number of pages in third section. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Total pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. So, there are 125 pages in the book.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 91 + 23 + 25 = 149 pages.  Now, let's find out how many pages are in the first chapter compared to the second chapter. We can do this by dividing the number of pages in the first chapter (91) by the number of pages in the second chapter (23). So, if we divide 91 by 23, we get 3.87. This means that the first chapter has approximately 3.87 times more pages than the second chapter. Therefore, the first chapter contains around 38.7 pages more than the second chapter.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 + 18 + 3 = 64 pages.  Now, let's find out how many pages are there in the second chapter compared to the third chapter. We can see from the question that the second chapter has 18 pages, and the third chapter has only 3 pages. So, the ratio of pages in the second chapter to the third chapter is 18 : 3 = 6 : 1. Therefore, the second chapter contains 6 times more pages than the third chapter.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 150 (53 + 75 + 21 = 150). Now, let's find out how many pages are there in each fejeze...;
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages, so we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Total number of pages = 31 x 61 Total number of pages = 1861 pages Now, we know that there are 1861 pages in the book.;
Response:  The book has 2 fejezete (chapters), and each chapter has 23 pages in total. Since there are two chapters, the total number of pages is twice that of one chapter, which is 46 pages. Now, we know that the first chapter has 10 pages long, so the number of pages in the first chapter is 10/46 = 0.22 or 22%. Therefore, the first chapter contains approximately 22% of the total pages of the book.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages. So, the total number of pages is 2 x 81 = 162 pages.  Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter. We are given that the second chapter takes up 68 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is 68.;
Response:  We know that 62 tábornok indult evezni reggel and 39 tábornok indult evezni délután. So, we need to find out how many more tábornok started sailing in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can divide the number of tábornok who sailed in the morning (62) by the number of tábornok who sailed in the afternoon (39). This gives us:  Number of tábornok who sailed in the morning = 62  Number of tábornok who sailed in the afternoon = 39  Difference between the two numbers = 62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 more tábornok who started sailing in the morning than in the afternoon.;
Response:  We know that 52 tábornok started sailing in the morning and 61 tábornok started sailing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 52. Afternoon = 61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 more tábornoks who sailed in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  We know that 15 commanders started sailing in the morning and some of them sailed again in the afternoon. So, we can assume that at least 15 + x commanders sailed in the afternoon, where x is the number of commanders who sailed both in the morning and afternoon. Since there were 32 total commanders, we can write an equation as follows: 15 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get: x = 17. Therefore, 17 commanders sailed both in the morning and afternoon.;
Response:  If some generals sailed in the morning and 7 generals sailed in the afternoon, then we can say that x generals sailed in the morning if y generals sailed in the afternoon.  Therefore, the number of generals who sailed in the morning is equal to 60 - 7y.;
Response:  If 36 commanders started early in the morning, then they must have finished their mission at noon (since there are only 12 hours between dawn and dusk). So, the number of commanders who completed their mission together is 36 - 12 = 24. Similarly, if 13 commanders finished their mission in the afternoon, then they too must have started their mission at noon, so the total number of commanders who completed their mission together is 24 + 13 = 37. Finally, if 49 commanders finished their mission in the evening, then they must have started their mission at noon as well, which means that the total number of commanders who completed their mission together is 37 + 49 = 86. Therefore, the answer to the question is 86.;
Response:  We know that 44 commanders started early in the morning, 39 commanders sailed in the afternoon, and 31 commanders sailed at night. To find out how many more commanders sailed in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of commanders who sailed in the afternoon from the number of commanders who sailed in the morning: 44 - 39 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more commanders who sailed in the morning than in the afternoon.;
Response:  We know that 53 commanders started rowing early in the morning and 48 commanders finished late in the afternoon. So, there are more commanders who finished later than those who started earlier. Therefore, the number of commanders who finished later is equal to the difference between the total number of commanders (101) and the number of commanders who started early (53). Hence, the answer is: More commanders finished later than those who started early = 101 - 53 = 48.;
Response:  If there are 33 commanders who started early in the morning and 34 commanders who arrived late in the afternoon, then we have a total of 67 commanders (33 + 34). Now, let's find out how many more commanders were present in the afternoon than in the evening. To do this, we need to subtract the number of commanders who arrived in the evening from the total number of commanders: 67 - 10 = 57. Therefore, there are 57 commanders more in the afternoon than in the evening.;
Response:  We know that 13 tábornok evezett and 59 tábornok túrázott in the morning. So, altogether they were 72 tábornok (13 + 59). Now we are told that 21 tábornok started to sail in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of tábornok who sailed together is 72 + 21 = 93 tábornok.;
Response:  We know that 29 tábornok evezett and 66 tábornok túrázott in the morning. So, the total number of tábornoks who went for a swim or tour in the morning is: 29 + 66 = 95. Now we need to find out how many more tábornoks started their journey in the afternoon than those who started in the morning. To do this, we subtract the number of tábornoks who started in the morning from the total number of tábornoks who started their journey in the afternoon: 95 - 26 = 69. Therefore, there are 69 tábornoks who started their journey in the afternoon more than the ones who started in the morning.;
Response:  We know that 41 tábornok evezett and 4 tábornok túrázott in the morning. So, altogether they were 45 tábornok (41 + 4). Now we are told that 26 tábornok started to sail in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of tábornok who sailed or toured is equal to 45 - 26 = 19.;
Response:  We know that 43 tábornok indult evezni reggel, so there are 43 - 4 = 39 tábornok who did not start their journey in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of tábornok who evezi dellután is 46 - 39 = 17.;
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples on the tree, then after she picked 4 apples, there would be 3 apples left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are still 3 apples on the tree.;
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples (not almonds). Then she picked some and now there are only two left on the tree. So, Rachel must have picked 2 apples. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from the tree and now there are only 5 left on the tree. If 3 of them were unripe and the rest weren't, then we can conclude that the number of unripe apples is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of ripe ones. So, if there were initially 10 apples (including both ripe and unripe), then the number of unripe apples would be: Number of unripe apples = Total number of apples - Number of ripe apples = 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 unripe apples on the tree.;
Response:  If Rachel has picked two ripe apples from the tree and now there are 7 apples on the tree, then we can assume that 5 of them are not yet ripe (since she only picked 2). So, there are 5 unripe apples on the tree.;
Response:  Rachel picked 6 apples from the tree and now there are 2 mature apples and 4 immature ones left on the tree. So, initially, Rachel had to plant 6 x 2 = 12 apple seeds in the ground. Therefore, she needed to start with 12 apples.;
Response:  Rachel picked 3 mature apples from the tree initially. Now there are 2 mature and 27 immature apples on the tree. So, the number of mature apples that were on the tree initially is 3 - 2 = 1.;
Response:  Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and then two new apples grew on the tree. Now there are 6 apples left on the tree. So, to find out how many apples Rachel had to pick, we need to subtract the number of apples that grew after she picked them (2) from the total number of apples on the tree before she picked any (8). Therefore, the answer is 8 - 2 = 6.;
Response:  We know that initially there were two apples on the tree (Rachel had two). Then she picked four from the tree. So, after picking, there are 2 + 4 = 6 apples left on the tree. Finally, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, now there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked two apples from the tree and now she has seven apples left on the tree. So, initially there were 52 apples on the tree (Rachel's total number of apples). Now we need to find out how many apples Rachel had to start with on the tree. To do this, we can divide the initial number of apples by the number of apples she picked:  Number of apples Rachel had to start with = Initial number of apples / Number of apples picked = 52 / 2 = 26 Therefore, Rachel had to start with 26 apples on the tree.;
Response:  Rachel has picked 8 almonds from each of her 3 trees. So she has picked in total 8 x 3 = 24 almonds. Now, there are 9 almonds left on all the trees together. Therefore, initially there were 9 - 24 = -15 almonds on all the trees.;
Response:  We know that Rachel has four apple trees and she picked 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, she picked 4 x 7 = 28 apples. Therefore, there are 29 - 28 = 1 more apple left on all of the trees combined. So, Rachel picked 1 apple.;
"Response:  We know that Ed has two more golf balls than Doug and that Ed has 19 more golf balls than Doug. So, if we let x be the number of golf balls that Doug had at first (i.e., before he lost any), then we can write:

Ed has 2x golf balls + 19 = 38 golf balls total.

Now, since Doug lost some golf balls during the game, we know that his new amount of golf balls is less than 38. In particular, we are told that Doug has fewer golf balls than Ed does. Therefore, we can conclude that Doug must have lost at least 19 golf balls (since he has fewer golf balls than Ed). But this means that Doug started with at most 19 golf balls (since he cannot have more golf balls than Ed does). So, we can set up the equation:

19 ≤ x < 38

Solving for x gives us:

x = 19

Therefore, Doug lost exactly 19 golf balls during the game.";
"Response:  We know that Ednek had ten baskets and Dougg had eleven goals lost on the playground. If Ednek has 45 balls, then he must have more than Douggg, who scored 11 goals. So, the difference between Ednek's number of balls and Douggg's is:

$$ \text{Number of balls} = \text{Ednek's balls} - \text{Douggg's goals} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text{Number of balls} = 45 - 11 = 34 $$

Therefore, there are 34 more balls in Ednek's basket than in Douggg's basket.";
"Response:  We know that Ednek had more than 7 golyós (goló = bullet). So if Ednek has x golyós, then he lost y golyós (where y is the number of golyós Doug took from him). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x - y = 7...(1) Since Doug took 7 golyós from Ednek, we have:
x = y + 7...(2) Now, let's substitute Equation (2) into Equation (1):
(y + 7) - y = 7
Simplifying:
2y = 7
Dividing both sides by 2:
y = 3
Now, we know that Ednek had 22 golyós initially and lost 7 golyós to Doug, so the number of golyós Doug has now is:
Ednek's remaining golyós = 22 - 7 = 15
Therefore, Doug has 15 golyós.";
Response:  We know that Ednek had more than 5 goals (Doug lost 3). So, Ednek had at least 5 + 3 = 8 goals. Therefore, Doug had x goals. Since Ednek had 27 goals in total, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 27. Solving for x, we get: x = 19. So, Doug had 19 goals.;
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 24 bullets and less than 36 bullets. So, we can say that Ed had exactly 29 bullets. Now let's compare this with Doug. We know that Doug lost 27 bullets on the playground, which means he had 9 bullets left. Therefore, Ed had 29 - 9 = 20 bullets more than Doug.;
Response:  We know that Ed had more than 29 bullets and less than 30 bullets. So, we can say that Ed had exactly 30 bullets.  Now, let's consider Doug's situation. We know that he lost 17 bullets on the playing field. So, if Ed had 30 bullets and lost 17, then Ed must have started with 47 bullets (30 - 17 = 47). Therefore, Ed had 47 bullets left after losing 17 bullets, which means he had 64 bullets in total (47 + 17 = 64).  Thus, Ed had 64 bullets remaining, as compared to Doug who had only 17 bullets remaining.;
"Response:  We know that Ed has more than eight golf balls than Doug. So, if Ed had 8 golf balls and Doug had x golf balls, then we can write an equation as follows:  Ed = 8 + x. Since Ed lost some of his golf balls on the playground, we know that Ed - (lost golf balls) = x. Now, we need to find out how many golf balls Ed lost. According to the passage, ""Ed lost some of his golf balls on the playground."" Therefore, we can substitute the value of x with the number of golf balls Ed lost, which is 4 in this case. So, we have:  Ed = 8 + 4. Simplifying the equation, we get:  Ed = 12. Therefore, Ed lost 4 golf balls.";
"Response:  We know that Ed had more golf balls than Doug. So, if Ed had x golf balls and Doug had y golf balls, then we can write an equation:
x > y
Now, we are told that Ed lost 21 golf balls on the playground. So, after losing those balls, Ed has:
x - 21 = y
We also know that Ed had 91 golf balls in total. So, substituting this value into our second equation, we get:
91 = x - 21
Solving for x, we get:
x = 70
So, Ed had 70 golf balls more than Doug.";
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 balls more than Doug. So, if Ed has x balls now, then Doug has x - 12 balls.  Since Ed lost 5 balls, he now has x - 5 = 7 balls. Therefore, Doug has (x - 12) + 5 = 17 balls.;
"Response:  We know that there are 408 students who suggested crumpli püré and 42 students who suggested salad. So, we can write this as an equation:

408 + 42 = x

Now, we need to solve for ""x"", which represents the number of students who suggested salad. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 450 (since there are 450 total students):

408 + 42 / 450 = x / 450

Simplifying the left-hand side gives us:

91 = x / 450

So, there were 91 students who suggested salad.";
"Response:  If 479 students recommended crumpled pudding and 489 students recommended salad, then we can say that the number of students who recommended salad is equal to the number of students who did not recommend crumpled pudding minus the number of students who recommended crumpled pudding. So, the number of students who recommended salad is:

Number of students who recommended salad = Number of students who did not recommend crumpled pudding - Number of students who recommended crumpled pudding
= 489 - 479
= 10
Therefore, 10 students recommended salad as their second choice instead of crumpled pudding.";
Response:  We know that there are 310 students in total and they were asked to suggest some food items for the menu. Out of these, 185 students suggested crumpli püré, which means that 60% (185/310) of the students preferred this option. Now, we need to find out how many students suggested bacon. To do this, we can divide the number of students who did not suggest any item (225) by the total number of students (310). This gives us approximately 72 students (225/310) who suggested bacon. Therefore, the answer is 72.;
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested salad and 104 students suggested crumpli puré. So, the number of students who suggested crumpli puré is 104.;
Response:  If 457 students suggested the krumpli püré and 63 of them did not suggest it, then there are 457 - 63 = 394 students who suggested the salad.;
Response:  If 182 students suggested crumpled pancakes and 166 students suggested salad, then there are 166 - 182 = 40 students who did not suggest either of those options. Therefore, 40 students suggested salad.;
Response:  If 324 students suggested crumpli püré, and 374 students suggested salad, then there are 698 total suggestions (324 + 374 = 698). Since 128 students suggested paprika, we have a total of 826 suggestions (698 + 128 = 826). Therefore, 826 students jvasulated new food items.;
Response:  We know that there are 257 students who suggested crumpli püré, and 120 students who suggested salad. So, the number of students who suggested crumpli püré is greater than the number of students who suggested salad. Therefore, we can say that x = 257 - 120 = 137 students suggested crumpli püré more than salad.;
Response:  We know that there are 144 students who suggested crumpli puré and 467 students who suggested salad. So, the total number of students is 144 + 467 = 611. Now, we need to find out how many students suggested crumpli puré more than twice as much as they suggested paradicsom. Since 79 students suggested paradicsom, if x is the number of students who suggested crumpli puré more than twice as much as they suggested paradicsom, then we can write an equation: x/2 = (611 - 79)/2 = 532/2 = 266. Therefore, 266 students suggested crumpli puré more than twice as much as they suggested paradicsom.;
Response:  We know that 228 students suggested crumpled pearls and 337 students suggested salad. So, the total number of students who suggested any vegetable is 565 (228 + 337). Now, we need to find out how many students suggested salad more than parsley. To do this, we can divide the number of students who suggested salad by the number of students who suggested parsley. If there are x students who suggested salad more than parsley, then the ratio of students who suggested salad to those who suggested parsley is x/565. Since 337 students suggested salad, we have x = 337 - 228 = 109. Therefore, 109 students suggested salad more than parsley.;
Response:  We know that there are 66 options for the new food item and 450 students in total. If 450 students participated in the voting process, then we can say that the number of participants = Total number of students - Number of non-participants (students who did not vote). So, the number of participants = 450 - x, where x is the number of non-participants. Now, we are given that 38 students voted for salmon, which means that 38 + x = 450, where x is the number of non-participants. Solving this equation, we get x = 72. Therefore, 72 students did not participate in the voting process.;
Response:  If 218 students suggested taking bread with their meals and 351 students suggested just having salad, then we can say that 569 (218 + 351) students in total suggested taking something with their meals. So, among these students, 351 students (or 60%) suggested only salad, while 218 students (or 40%) suggested both bread and salad.;
Response:  We know that there are 269 students who suggested salad, and 330 students who suggested crumpli püré. So, the total number of students is 269 + 330 = 599. Now, we need to find out how many students suggested crumpli püré more than salad. To do this, we will subtract the number of students who suggested salad from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of students who suggested crumpli püré more than salad is 599 - 269 = 330. So, 330 students jasotted the crumpli püré as their first choice.;
Response:  Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys.  So, in this case, the total number of students is 805 (569 + 236). Therefore, the number of girls is 805 - 236 = 571.;
Response:  Number of girls in school = 34. Total number of students in school = 841 (given). So, we can find out how many boys are there by subtracting the number of girls from total number of students: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls = 841 - 34 = 797. Therefore, there are 797 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys = Total - Number of girls.  Therefore, the number of boys in the school is: 485 - 232 = 253.;
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more than boys in the school, then the number of boys must be equal to 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls, then the number of boys in the school is:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 635 + (510 - 635)  Number of boys = 635 + (-92)  Number of boys = 543 Therefore, there are 543 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more than boys in the school, then the total number of students must be equal to 868 + 281 = 1149. Therefore, there are 1149 students in the school.;
Response:  If there are 700 girls and 142 boys in the school, then the total number of students in the school is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys  = 700 + 142 = 842  Therefore, there are 842 students in the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 boys and 222 girls in the school. Then, 418 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 706 + 418 = 1124 students. Therefore, there are 1124 students currently enrolled in the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls are currently in the school. Therefore, the current number of girls in the school is 946.;
Response:  We know that there are 632 boys in the school and 410 of them joined the school. So, the number of boys who did not join the school is: 632 - 410 = 222. Now we need to find out how many girls are in the school. According to the question, 465 girls enrolled in the school, so the total number of girls in the school is: 465 + 222 = 687. Therefore, there are 687 girls in the school more than the number of boys.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school. So, now we need to find out how many girls are left in the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of girls who joined from the total number of girls initially:  Number of girls initially = 732 Number of girls who joined = 682 Subtracting the number of girls who joined from the initial number gives us the current number of girls in the school:  Number of girls currently in the school = 732 - 682 = 50 Now, we have found out that there are 50 girls currently in the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and later 496 girls joined the school. So, the total number of students in the school after the addition of new students = Initial number of boys + Number of girls who joined the school.  Therefore, the number of boys in the school after the addition of new students = 214 + 496 = 710.;
Response:  Number of girls = 308. Number of boys = 318. Total number of students = Girls + Boys = 308 + 318 = 626. Therefore, there are 626 students in the school.;
Response:  Number of girls = 315  Number of boys = 309 Total number of students = 315 + 309 = 624 Total number of teachers = 772 Therefore, there are 624 students and 772 teachers in the school.;
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then we know that x = 402 (the number of girls). Since there are fewer boys than girls, we can say that y = 739 - x = 337 (the number of boys). So, there are 337 boys in the school.;
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of girls must be greater than or equal to the total number of students. So we can start with the information that there are 458 girls and 692 - 458 = 234 boys. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 458 + 234 = 692.;
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys in the school initially and 257 girls. Then, 403 girls joined the school. So, we need to find out how many girls are now in the school compared to the number of boys. To do this, we can divide the total number of girls (403) by the number of boys (362): Number of girls per boy = Total number of girls / Number of boys = 403 / 362 = 1.11 or approximately 111 girls for every 100 boys. Therefore, there are approximately 111 more girls than boys in the school.;
"Response: 
Edward had $18 in his pocket initially. He spent $16 of it. So he has $2 left now. Therefore, Edward has $2 remaining after spending $16.";
Response:  We know that Edward had 13 dolcsijas and spent some money. Now he has 3 dolcsijas left. So, we can calculate how much money he spent as follows: Total amount of money = Number of dolcsijas x Value of one dolcsija Total amount of money = 13 x $0.5 = $6.50 Since now he has 3 dolcsijas left, we can conclude that Edward spent $6.50 to buy them. Therefore, the answer is $6.50.;
Response:  Edward spent $6 first and then he spent another $8. So far, he has spent a total of $6 + $8 = $14. Now, he has $17 in his pocket. To find out how much Edward had before he started spending money, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $17 - $14 = $3. Therefore, Edward had $3 initially.;
Response:  Edward spent $92 on books and each book cost him $10. So he had $92 / $10 = 9 dollars left after buying the books. Now he has $6 + $9 = $15 left. Therefore, before spending money on the books, Edward had $16 - $15 = $1 in his pocket.;
Response:  If Edward spent $6 on each of two books, then he spent a total of $6 x 2 = $12 on both books. So, the value of one book is $12 / 2 = $6.;
Response:  Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on feathers. Now he has $19 left. So, before spending any money, Edward had $19 - $6 = $13.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on quills. So he has spent in total $7 (4 + 3). Now, we are told that he now has 12 dollars. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of money he spent on each item as follows: Books: $7 / 12 = $0.58 per book Quills: $7 / 12 = $0.25 per quill Since there is no remainder when dividing $7 by 12, we can conclude that Edward spent exactly $0.58 on each book and $0.25 on each quill.;
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on quills. So he had $24 initially. Now he has $19, so he gained $5. Therefore, Edward spent $5 on books compared to quills.;
Response:  Firstly, Edward spent $17 of his money. So he had $17 - $10 = $7 left. Therefore, Edward initially had $7 dollars.;
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 jump shots in the basketball court and David made more than 58 times as many jumpshots as Zachary. So if we assume that David made x number of jump shots, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Zachary made 44 jump shots
David made x jump shots
x = 58 × 44 = 2596
So David made 2596 jump shots in total.";
Response:  Zachary made 51 jumps and David made 44 jumps in total during the test. To find out how many times Zachary jumped more than David, we need to divide the number of jumps Zachary made (51) by the number of jumps David made (44). So, Zachary jumped more than David 1.17 times (51/44 = 1.17).;
Response:  We know that David made 44 flips in the gym. And we are told that David made 9 times more flips than Zachary. So if David made x flips, then Zachary made x/9 flips. Now we can substitute this value into the equation given in the problem:  Number of flips made by Zachary = (Number of flips made by David) / 9  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of flips made by Zachary = (44) / 9  Number of flips made by Zachary = 5  Therefore, Zachary made 5 flips in the gym.;
Response:  We know that David made 51 flips and Zachary made 49 flips. So, if they both performed together, they would have made a total of 51 + 49 = 100 flips.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 putts and had 44 grips today during practice.  David made fewer putts than Zachary but we don't know exactly how many. So let's assume David made x putts where x is less than 59. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  Number of putts made by David = x (Since David made fewer putts than Zachary)  Now we are asked to find out how many putts David made. To do this, we need to isolate the variable 'x'.  We can do this by subtracting 59 from both sides of the equation:  Number of putts made by David = x - 59 (After subtracting 59 from both sides)  Now we have an equation with only one variable;x':  x = 59 - x (After rearranging the equation)  Solving for 'x', we get:  x = 30 (The value of 'x' is equal to 30)  Therefore, David made 30 putts today during practice.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 flips and had 17 cramps during the test.  David made 29 more flips than Zachary, but he did 13 fewer flips than Zachary. So, if we want to find out how many times David exceeded Zachary, we can subtract the number of flips they both made from each other: (44 - 17) = 27. Therefore, David exceeded Zachary by 27 flips.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 floor taps and 14 crunches today during practice.  David did 17 floor taps but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that David did x floor taps where x is less than 53. Since David did fewer crunches than Zachary, let's assume that he did y crunches where y is also less than 14. Now we have two equations: 53 = x + y and 17 = x - 10. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us: x = 36 and y = 8. Therefore, Zachary did 53 floor taps and 14 crunches, while David did 36 floor taps and 8 crunches.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 35 flips and 3 kicks during the test.  David made 58 more flips than Zachary but 87 fewer kicks than Zachary. How many times did Zachary make more flips than he did kicks? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of kicks from the number of flips for both Zachary and David. For Zachary, we have: 35 - 3 = 32 (flips) 32 - 87 = -55 (kicks) So Zachary made more flips than kicks by 55 times. Similarly, for David, we have: 58 - 87 = -30 (flips) -55 = -85 (kicks) So David made more flips than kicks by 85 times. Therefore, the answer is 55.;
Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 flips and 58 flops during the test.  David made 38 more flips than Zachary but 62 fewer clutches than Zachary. So we can write an equation as follows:  Number of flips = 46 + (38 x David) - (62 x Clutches). Now let's find out how many times Zachary did hanging leg raises. Since he made 58 flops, each flop represents one hang. Therefore, the number of times Zachary performed hanging leg raises is equal to the number of flops he made, which is 58. Hence, Zachary performed hanging leg raisess 58 times.;
Response:  We know that David made 39 more fekovió tampsthan Zachary and John made 13 fewer than David. So we can write an equation based on this information:  David made x fekovió tampsthan Zachary. And John made y fewer than David.  Now we have two equations:  x - 13 = 39 (from the first equation) and y = x - 13 (from the second equation).  Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the value of x = 42 and y = -9. Therefore, David made 42 fekovió tampsthan Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary fell 51 times in the gym today. David made 22 more floorings than Zachary. So, David made 73 floors (51 + 22). Now we are told that John did not fall as many times as David. Therefore, John made fewer floorings than David. The number of floorings John made is equal to 73 - 4 = 69.;
Response:  We know that David made 39 more feather castles than Zachary and John made 9 fewer feather castles than David. So we can write an equation based on this information:  David - 9 = Zachary + 39  Now let's solve for Zachary:  If David made 39 more feather castles than Zachary, then Zachary must have made x fewer feather castles than David. Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this one gives us:  x = 39 - 9 = 20  Therefore, Zachary made 20 fewer feather castles than David.;
Response:  We know that David made 30 more jumps than Zachary during the test. So if Zachary jumped x times, then David jumped 3x times. Since David jumped 37 times while lying down, we can set up the equation: 3x = 37. Solving for x, we get: x = 12. Therefore, Zachary jumped 12 times during the test.;
Response:  We know that David made 56 more jumps than Zachary during the test. If David jumped 38 times while lying down, then Zachary jumped x times. Since David made 56 more jumps than Zachary, we can write an equation: 38 + x = 94 (Zachary's total number of jumps) Now let's solve for x: x = 94 - 38 = 56 So Zachary jumped 56 times while lying down.;
Response:  We know that David made 40 jumps and Zachary made 34 jumps. So, we can write this as an equation: 40 = x + 62 (where x is the number of jumps made by David). Now, we are also given that Zachary made 17 fewer jumps than David. This means that David made x - 17 jumps. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 40 = x + 62 - 17. Solving for x, we get: x = 23. So, David made 23 jumps.;
Response:  We know that David made 36 more layups than Zachary and 33 fewer dunks than Zachary in the test. So if Zachary made 58 layups and 33 dunks, then he must have made x dunks at the dunk line. Since we are given that David made 36 more layups than Zachary, David must have made 36 + x layups in total. Therefore, the number of layups Zachary made at the dunk line is x = 21.;
Response:  We know that David made 27 jumps and Zachary made 34 jumps. So, we can write an equation as follows:  David's jumps = Zachary's jumps + 7 (since Zachary jumped 7 more than David)  Now, let's substitute this equation into the problem statement:  Total number of jumps = 27 + (34 - 7)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Total number of jumps = 34 + 20  Total number of jumps = 54  Therefore, Zachary made 54 jumps at the obstacle course.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension for her homework. So far so good! Now let's find out how many pages she had to do in total from math and reading combined. To do this, we need to add the number of pages from each subject together. In this case, it would be: 5 + 2 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of homework from math and reading combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, if we divide the number of pages of reading comprehension homework by 2 (since each page has 4 questions), we get: $ \frac{4}{2} = 2$ pages of reading comprehension homework were completed. Therefore, the answer is 2 pages.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and more than 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, if we assume that there were exactly 7 pages of reading comprehension homework, then Rachel would have completed 7 - 5 = 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.;
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and she was given 4 pages of reading comprehension to do instead, then we can calculate the number of pages of reading comprehension that Rachel needed to complete as follows:

Number of pages of reading comprehension = Total number of pages of homework / Number of pages of math homework
= 7 / 4
= 1.75 pages

So, Rachel needed to complete approximately 1.75 pages of reading comprehension to make up for the missing 3 pages of math homework.";
Response:  If there were 8 pages of math homework and it was required to complete three pages, then we need to divide 8 by 3 = 2.75 pages. Since you can't have a fraction of a page, round up to the nearest whole number which is 3 pages. So, in total, Rachel needed to complete 3 pages of her math homework.;
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and she completed only 6 pages, then she did not complete 2 pages of homework. So, the number of pages of math homework that Rachel did not complete is 2.;
Response:  If Rachel had to complete three page reading comprehension tasks at home, and each task was one page long, then she would have needed to complete 3 pages in total.;
Response:  If there were 2 pages of math homework and 3 pages of reading comprehension homework, then the total number of pages would be: 2 + 3 = 5 pages.  As for the biology assignment, if it was 10 pages long, then the total number of pages to complete would be: 5 + 10 = 15 pages. So, in total, the student had to complete 15 pages of work.;
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension for her English class. So far, we have:
Math: 9 pages x = 90 pages (since each page has 10 problems) Total math homework: 90 pages
Reading Comprehension: 2 pages x = 20 pages (since each page has 5 questions) Total reading comprehension: 20 pages
Now, let's find out how many pages Rachel had to complete in biology: Biology: 96 pages - (90 + 20) = 76 pages Total biology homework: 76 pages
So, Rachel had to complete 76 pages of biology homework in addition to the 90 pages of math homework and 20 pages of reading comprehension.";
Response:  We know that Rachel received 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.  We also know that she received 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, we can conclude that Rachel received 3 times more biology homework than math homework (i.e., 3 x 3 = 9). So, Rachel received 9 pages of biology homework in total.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework.  However, we are not given any information about how many pages she had to do for biology. So, we can conclude that Rachel did not have to do any biology homework. Therefore, the number of pages she read in biology is zero (0).;
Response:  We know that there are 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, we have to add these two numbers together to get the total number of pages for both tasks. Therefore, the total number of pages is: 9 + 11 = 20 pages. Now, let's move on to the biology assignment. We know that there are 29 pages in this task. So, we need to add this number to the previous total to get the final answer. The final answer is: 20 + 29 = 49 pages.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, we have to complete 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework in total. Now, let's consider the biology homework. There are 3 pages of biology homework, so we have to complete 15 - 3 = 12 pages of homework in total. Therefore, the student has to complete 12 pages of homework from the math, reading comprehension, and biology assignments.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 types of tasks: reading comprehension (5 pages), homework (10 pages), and biology (6 + 2 = 8 pages). So, in total, we need to read 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 pages. Therefore, you needed to read 23 pages from the biology homework.;
Response:  We know that Rachel had to prepare an 2-page reading comprehension homework and a 4-page math homework. So far so good! Now let's calculate how many pages of math homework Rachel had to do in total: 2 + 4 = 6 pages. Therefore, Rachel had to do 6 pages of math homework in total.;
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension and 7 pages of math homework. So far, we have:

Rachel completed 4 + 7 = 11 pages of homework.

Now, let's find out how many pages she had to complete in math from the given information:

We are told that Rachel had to complete ""much more"" than 11 pages of math homework. This means that if 11 pages is the minimum amount of work required, then the actual number of pages must be greater than or equal to 11. In other words, the range of possible values for m is [11, infinity).

So, the answer to your question is:

Matlab: m >= 11

In summary, Rachel had to complete at least 11 pages of math homework.";
Response:  If Jack had an email that broke in the morning and two more in the afternoon, then he received a total of 3 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). So, Jack received 3 emails during the day.;
Response:  If Jack had received 5 emails yesterday morning and his email account broke down in the afternoon, then he must have received x emails between noon and 2 pm (when his account broke down). Since he received 5 emails yesterday morning, we can conclude that he received x - 5 emails between noon and 2 pm. Therefore, Jack received 3 emails after noon.;
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails and they all failed, then he did not receive any emails that day. So, if he received 5 emails in total during the day, then he must have received none of them after lunchtime (délután). Therefore, Jack did not receive any emails after lunchtime.;
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in total (in the morning), and then he received 3 more emails in the evening. So, altogether he received 6 + 3 = 9 emails in one day.;
Response:  Regardless of whether he received any emails in the evening (8 pm), Jack received 5 emails during the daytime and 72 emails overall. So, he received 5 + 72 = 77 emails in total. Therefore, Jack received 77 emails in total - 5 emails in the morning and 72 emails in the afternoon/evening.;
Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in total and they all failed. So, he must have received some emails during each of these time slots: morning (5), afternoon (3), evening (8). Therefore, Jack received 5 + 3 + 8 = 16 emails in total.;
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received a total of 7 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). However, the question states that he also received 8 emails in the evening. So, the final number of emails Jack received is 7 + 8 = 15.;
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 17 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 27 emails. Therefore, Jack received 27 - 10 = 17 emails in the afternoon/evening.;
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in total. He received 3 emails in the morning (10 am), and he received 4 emails in the evening (7 pm). So, he received 3 + 4 = 7 emails during the day. Therefore, Jack received 9 - 7 = 2 emails in the morning.;
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the evening. So he received a total of 9 emails. Therefore, Jack received 1 email more in the evening than he did in the morning.;
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the morning and some more in the evening (without specifying how many), then he received a total of 3 + x emails that day, where x is the number of emails he received in the evening. Since we know that Jack received 10 emails that day, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So, Jack received 7 emails in the evening.;
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So far, he has received a total of 67 items (emails + letters). Then in the afternoon, he received 5 more emails and 54 more letters. Therefore, Jack received a total of 121 items that day (morning + afternoon).;
Response:  On day one, Jack received 5 emails and 8 letters (total = 13). In the afternoon, he received another 9 emails and 7 letters (total = 16). So in total, Jack received 13 + 16 = 29 messages that day.;
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. Then he received 3 more emails and 44 more letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 10 + 3 = 13 emails and 12 + 44 = 56 letters during the day. Therefore, Jack received 13 emails and 56 letters during the day.;
Response:  Jack received 8 emails and 8 letters in total. Then he received 2 more emails after that. So, Jack received a total of 10 emails (8 + 2). Now, we are asked how many letters Jack received in the morning compared to the afternoon. Since Jack received 7 letters in the afternoon, we can conclude that he received 3 letters in the morning (10 - 7 = 3). Therefore, Jack received 3 letters in the morning.;
Response:  Jack sent 91 emails in the morning and then he received 2 emails. So, his total number of emails sent that day is 91 + 2 = 93. Then, he sent 74 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 93 + 74 = 167 emails in one day.;
Response:  On day one, Jack sent 4 emails and 2 letters. So he sent a total of 6 pieces of mail (4 emails + 2 letters). Then, in the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 letters. Therefore, Jack sent a total of 14 pieces of mail that day (6 emails + 8 letters).;
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails in one day and he got 7 emails in the morning, then he must have received 2 more emails in the afternoon (since there are 14 hours in a day). So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received a total of 9 + 2 = 11 emails that day.;
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in total. So, he must have received some number of emails between 5 am and noon (when he woke up). Therefore, we can say that Jack received at least 2 emails during this time period. Now, let's consider the evening when he went to bed. He said he received 16 emails that day. Since he didn't receive any emails after going to bed, all the remaining 14 emails must have been sent before he went to bed. So, Jack received 2 emails during the morning and 14 emails during the afternoon/evening.;
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the afternoon and he received some more emails at night, then we can say that he received x emails in the afternoon + y emails at night. Since there are 10 total emails per day, we have the equation: x + y = 10. Now, we know that x = 3 because Jack received three emails in the afternoon. So, y = 10 - 3 = 7. Therefore, Jack received 7 emails at night.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 12 times further than the frog. So if the frog jumped 9 times, then the beaver jumped 12 - 9 = 3 times farther. Therefore, the beaver jumped 3 x 9 = 27 hüvelyek (units) farther than the frog.;
Response:  The dragonfly jumped 31 times and the frog jumped 35 times. So together they jumped 31 + 35 = 66 times.;
Response:  The szúnyó (fly) jumped 36 times its own length. So, if we assume that the fly's length is x, then it jumped x + 36x = 42x meters.  Now, the béka (frog) jumped 17 times farther than the szúnyó. If the distance between the fly and the frog after the first jump was x, then the distance between them after the second jump would be x + (17 \* x) = 18x meters.  Finally, the egér (rat) jumped 15 times farther than the béka. If the distance between the béka and the egér after the third jump was y meters, then the distance between them after the fourth jump would be y + (15 \* y) = 16y meters. Therefore, the béka jumped 18x - 16y = 2 meters farther than the fly.;
Response:  The szúnyó (fly) jumped 25 times its own length, so it jumped 25 x 0.3 = 7.5 meters. Then, the béka (frog) jumped 18 times its own length, so it jumped 18 x 0.6 = 10.8 meters beyond the fly's distance. Finally, the egér (mouse) jumped 2 times its own length, so it jumped 2 x 0.2 = 0.4 meters beyond the frog's distance. Therefore, the mouse jumped 10.8 + 0.4 = 11.2 meters away from the starting point.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 10 more than the spider and the rabbit jumped 20 more than the beaver. So, the rabbit jumped 30 more than the spider (20 + 10). Therefore, the rabbit jumped 30 more than the spider.;
Response:  The szúnyó (fly) jumped 19 times its own length, so it jumped 19 x 2 = 38 times its own length.  Now, the béka (frog) jumped 39 times more than the fly, which means it jumped 39 + 38 = 77 times its own length. Finally, the egér (rat) jumped less than half as much as the béka, which means it jumped 77 / 2 = 38.5 times its own length. So, the béka jumped 77 times its own length.;
Response:  The szúnyó (fly) jumped 25 times its own length, so it jumped 25 x 10 = 250 units. Then, the béka (frog) jumped 32 units more than the fly, so it jumped 250 + 32 = 282 units. Finally, the egér (mouse) jumped 26 units less than the frog, so it jumped 282 - 26 = 256 units. Therefore, the mouse jumped 256 units away from the starting point.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 33 more than the spider and the rabbit jumped 5 less than the beaver. So, if we want to find out how many jumps the rabbit made compared to the spider, we can subtract 5 from the number of jumps the beaver made. Therefore, the rabbit jumped 28 fewer times than the spider (33 - 5 = 28).;
Response:  The beaver jumped 13 times and each time it jumped 5 cm further than before. So after 13 jumps, the beaver would have moved 65 cm (13 x 5 cm/time). Since the flea started from the same point as the beaver, we can say that the distance between them is equal to the distance traveled by the beaver. Therefore, the distance between the flea and the beaver is 65 cm.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 35 times and then added 10 cents. So, the total number of jumps is 35 + 10 = 45.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 19 times more than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x hüvelyek (units), then the beaver jumped x + 19 hüvelyek.  We know that the beaver jumped less than the rat, so the beaver jumped 44 - x hüvelyek. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 19 = 44 - x. Solving for x, we get: x = 25. So, the beaver jumped 25 hüvelyek (units) more than the frog.;
Response:  The total distance covered by all three animals together is equal to the sum of their individual distances. So, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = Szúnyó + Béka + Egér We know that the szúnyó jumped 39 times its own length (since it took 39 hüvelyek to reach the béka), so its distance traveled was 39 x Length of a szúnyó = 39L. Similarly, we know that the béka jumped 19 times its own length beyond the szúnyó, so its distance traveled was 19 x Length of a béka = 19K. And finally, we know that the egér jumped less than the béka by a factor of 2, so its distance traveled was 2 x (19K - Distance of the egér) = 2(19K - E). Now we have three equations and three unknowns: Distance of the egér = E, Distance of the béka = K, and Total distance = L + 39L + 19K + 2E. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the values of E = 48, K = 36, and L = 54. Therefore, the egér ugrothow far? Answer: 48 hüvelyk (or 48 cm).;
Response:  The total number of jumps made by all three animals together is: Szúnyog - 21 + Béka - 25 + Egér - 16 = 62 jumps. So, the difference between the number of jumps made by the szúnyog and the egér is: Szúnyog - Egér = 62 - 16 = 46 jumps. Therefore, the szúnyog ugrott 46 more jumps than the egér.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 39 times and the frog jumped 17 times. So, the difference between their jumps is: 39 - 17 = 22. Therefore, the beaver jumped 22 more times than the frog.;
Response:  The bunny jumped 10 cm more than the frog, and the frog jumped 9 cm more than the hare. So, if we add these distances together, we get:  Hare + (Frog - Bunny) =  Egernumber of centimeters  Substituting the given values, we get:  Hare + (10 + (-9)) = 28  Simplifying, we get:  Hare = 20 cm  Therefore, the eggroamed 20 cm.;
Response:  The beaver jumped 37 times further than the frog, and the frog jumped 14 times farther than the snake. So, the snake jumped 23 times as far as the beaver (37 - 14 = 23). Therefore, the egg jumps 23 times more than the snake.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to make the dough (5/14 = 0.36). To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can multiply the total amount of flour needed (14) by the proportion of flour left to add (14 - 5 = 9): 9 x 0.36 = 3.28 cups. So, Mary needs to add 3 and 2/3 cups of flour to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the dough (which is equal to 320 grams). Now we need to find out how much sugar she needs to add based on the recipe. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour, you need 1/3 cup of sugar. So if Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, then she needs to add 4 x 1/3 = 1 1/3 cups of sugar. Since there are 16 tablespoons in one cup, we can convert this amount to tablespoons as follows: 1 1/3 cups x 16 tablespoons/cup = 22 tablespoons of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 22 tablespoons of sugar to the dough.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the dough. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour for the recipe, and she has already added some, then we can calculate how much she needs to add based on the amount she has already used. So, let's say she has added x cups of flour so far. Then, if she needs 8 more cups, we can set up an equation like this:

x + 8 = 8

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8 - 8

So, Mary needs to add 0 cups of flour to the recipe.";
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour (pár csésze), and she still needs to add 2 more cups of flour, then we can calculate how much flour she has already added as follows:  Pár csésze = 2/5 = 0.4 cups (since there are 5 cups in a cup) So, Mary has already added 0.4 cups of flour. Now, let's find out how many cups of flour she needs to add altogether:  Total amount of flour needed = 11 - 0.4 = 10.6 cups Since Mary has already added 0.4 cups, she still needs to add 10.2 cups of flour (10.6 - 0.4). Therefore, the answer is 10.2 cups.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to the dough and the recipe requires 7 more cups (for a total of 10). So we need to find out how many cups are left after adding the 3 cups that Mary has already used. To do this, we can divide the total amount required (10) by the amount that Mary has already added (3): 10 / 3 = 3.33... cups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, we round up to 4 cups of flour remaining to be added to the dough. Therefore, the answer is 4 cups.;
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour (pár csésze), and she needs to add 2 more cups of flour, then the total amount of flour she has added is:  Pár csésze = 2 csésze. So, the number of cups of flour that Mary has added so far is: 2 + 2 = 4 cups.;
Response:  We know that total amount of flour needed is 9 cups and we have already added 3 cups. So, remaining amount = Total amount - Amount already added = 9 - 3 = 6 cups. Therefore, we need to add 6 more cups of flour to make the torta.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to the dough. To find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can use the following equation: Number of remaining cups = Total amount - Amount already added Total amount = 14 cups (original amount) - 10 cups (amount already added) = 4 cups So, Mary needs to add 4 cups of sugar to the dough.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the dough (out of 12). So, we need to find out how many cups of flour are left to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour needed (12) by the amount of flour Mary has already added (11): Number of cups of flour left = Total amount of flour needed / Amount of flour already added = 12 / 11 = 1 cup Therefore, there is one cup of flour left to add to the dough.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour to the mixture and according to the recipe, we need 3 more cups of flour for a total of 10 cups. So, we need to add 3 more cups of flour to the mixture. Now, let's calculate how much cake will result from this amount of flour:  Total volume of mixture = 10 cups (flour) + 2 cups (sugar) + 80 cups (salt) = 92 cups  Since we have already added 7 cups of flour, the remaining amount needed is: Remaining flour = Total volume - Amount already added = 92 cups - 7 cups = 85 cups  Therefore, we need to add 85 cups of flour to the mixture in addition to the 2 cups of sugar and 80 cups of salt.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of flour (2/12 = 0.16) to the dough. Now we need to find out how much flour is left for us to add. So, we divide the total amount of flour needed (12 cups) by the amount of flour used so far (2 cups): 12 / 2 = 6 cups. Therefore, there are six cups of flour remaining to be added to the dough.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to the mixture (which is equal to 30% of the total amount). So, we need to find out how much cake will be left after adding the remaining cake ingredients.  The ratio of cake to flour is 2:1, so if Mary adds 1 cup of flour, she will get 2 cups of cake. Therefore, if she adds 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 80% of the total amount), she will get 8 cups of cake.  Now, let's calculate the number of cups of sugar needed:  Since the ratio of sugar to flour is 1:2, if Mary adds 1 cup of flour, she will need 2 cups of sugar. Therefore, if she adds 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 80% of the total amount), she will need 8 cups of sugar.  Finally, let's calculate the number of cups of salt needed:  Since the ratio of salt to flour is 1:2, if Mary adds 1 cup of flour, she will need 2 cups of salt. Therefore, if she adds 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 80% of the total amount), she will need 8 cups of salt.  In conclusion, Mary needs to add 8 cups of sugar and 8 cups of salt to the mixture in order to make the correct amount of cake according to the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cups of sugar (2). So, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount she has already added:  Total amount of sugar = 12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 10 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the dough (which is equal to 240 grams). Now we need to find out how much flour she needs to add to make the total weight of ingredients equal to 1800 grams (the sum of 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar). So, we divide 1800 grams by 240 grams per cup: 

$$ \frac {1800}{240} = 7.5 $$

Therefore, Mary needs to add $ 7.5$ cups of flour to the dough.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to the dough (she said she put in ""two cups""). So now we need to find out how much more flour is needed. To do this, we can use the ratio of flour to sugar given in the recipe: 1 cup of flour = 3/4 cup of sugar. Since Mary has already used 2 cups of flour, she needs an additional 7/4 cups of flour (since there are 9 cups of sugar). Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 3/4 cups of flour to the remaining 4 cups of sugar.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to make the dough (which is equal to 220 grams). Now we need to find out how much sugar she needs to add based on the recipe. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, which is equal to 100 grams. So, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 90 grams of sugar (5 - 11 = 90) to complete the recipe.;
"Response:  If Mary has already added some flour to the dough and still needs 5 more cups of flour, then she must have added x cups of flour initially. Since there are 10 cups of flour in total needed for the recipe, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = 10... (1)

Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem statement into Equation (1):

x + 5 = 10

We know that x is equal to the number of cups of flour that Mary has already added, which is 2 (according to the problem statement). Therefore, we can plug this value into Equation (1):

2 + 5 = 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

So, Mary has added 7 cups of flour to the dough so far.";
"Response:  If Mary has already added some flour to make the dough (as stated in the problem), then we can assume that she has added at least some amount of flour. So, let's say she has added x cups of flour so far. Now, if the recipe requires 13 cups of flour and there are still 12 cups left to add, then we can calculate the number of cups Mary has added as follows:

x = 13 - 12 = 1
So, Mary has added 1 cup of flour to the dough.";
Response:  We know that there are 14 csésze (teaspoons) of flour in total needed for making the torta. Since we have already added 7 csésze (teaspoons) of flour, we need to add another 7 csésze (teaspoons) of flour to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 7 pohár (cups).;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10csézcukrot and 12csézeslíth to the dough. So we have:

Cukor: 10 + (12 - 9) = 18
Liszt: 12

So, we need to add 6 more cups of sugar to the dough:

Cukor: 18 + 6 = 24

Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar to the dough to make the torta according to the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour to the dough (which is equal to 6/15 or 1/2 of the total amount needed). So we need to find out how much more flour needs to be added. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total Amount = Remaining Amount + Initial Amount. In this case, the remaining amount is: Total Amount = 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, we need to add 9 cups of flour to the dough.;
"Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour in the recipe. Also, we know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to the mixture. So, if we want to find out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add to make the total amount equal to 9 + 14 = 23 cups (the sum of the amounts of sugar and flour), we can do the following calculation:

Hanya pohár liszt kell hozzáadni a cukorhoz, ha az összes mennyiség megegyezik a 23-mal. Azaz, ha a maradék mennyiség, amit hozzunk, megegyezik a 23-mal, akkor hányanak kell hozzáadni a lisztet.

So, let's calculate the remaining amount needed:

Remaining amount = Total amount - Amount already added
= 23 cups - 4 cups
= 19 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 19 cups of flour to the mixture.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (since she said ""Már two cups of flour""). So now we need to find out how much more flour is needed. According to the recipe, for every 3 cups of flour, you need 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of salt. Since Mary has already used 2 cups of flour, she needs another 5 cups of flour to make the full amount of sugar and salt required in the recipe. Therefore, the number of cups of flour that Mary needs right now is 5 - 2 = 3 cups.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to make the dough. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour, we need 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of salt. So, if we want to find out how much sugar is needed, we can use the following formula: Number of cups of sugar = Total amount of ingredients - (Number of cups of flour x Sugar ratio) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total amount of ingredients = 11 cups of sugar + 6 cups of flour + 9 cups of salt = 26 cups Total amount of ingredients - (12 cups of flour x Sugar ratio) = 26 cups - (12 x 1/3) = 26 cups - 4 = 22 cups Therefore, Mary needs to add 22 cups of sugar to the dough.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the dough (which is equal to 32 tablespoons). So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed to make 7 cups in total. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (7 cups) by the amount of sugar Mary has already added (4 cups):

Number of additional cups = Total amount - Amount already added = 7 cups - 4 cups = 3 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to the dough to make 7 cups in total.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the dough (which is equal to 60 teaspoons). The recipe requires a total of 12 cups of sugar (equal to 72 teaspoons), so we need to add an additional 5 cups of sugar (equal to 30 teaspoons) to the dough. Therefore, the answer is 30 teaspoons.;
Response:  If 19 bird families live near the mountain and they migrate to warmer countries during winter, then there are 19 x 6 = 114 birds that leave for migration.  If 60 bird families arrive at the mountain from these warmer countries, then the total number of birds at the mountain is 114 + 60 = 174 birds. Therefore, 174 birds have migrated to the mountain during winter.;
Response:  If 7 madaracalad replies to the winter, then there will be 87 - 7 = 80 madarcale left behind in the area.;
Response:  We know that 20 madarcsalád repültthe winter and 14 madarcsalád stayed behind. So, if we divide the number of madarcsaládsthat left (14) by the total number of madarcsaláds (34), we get: $ \frac {14} {34} = 0.4117647058823529 $. Therefore, there were approximately 41.18%madarcsaládfelt in the area initially.;
Response:  If 23 madaracalad replicated to Africa and 37 madarcaslard replicated to Asia, then the total number of madaracalads in Africa would be 23 x 10 = 230. Similarly, the total number of madaracalads in Asia would be 37 x 10 = 370. Now, we need to find out how many madaracalads are left near the mountain. We know that there were initially 85 madaracalads living near the mountain. So, after some madaracalads have migrated to other places, the remaining number of madaracalads near the mountain is equal to 85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 madaracalads left near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families near the mountain and they migrate to warmer countries. If 42 bird families went to Africa and 31 bird families went to Asia, then we can calculate the number of bird families that went to Africa as follows: Number of bird families in Africa = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families in Asia Number of bird families in Africa = 42 + (8 x 7) = 42 + 56 = 98 Therefore, 98 bird families went to Africa.;
Response:  We know that 38 bird families live near the mountain and 47 bird families have migrated to Africa. So, we can say that 38 + 47 = 85 bird families have left their original place to go somewhere else. Now, let's consider how many bird families went to Asia. According to the question, 94 bird families have migrated there. Therefore, we can conclude that 85 - 94 = -19 bird families did not migrate to Asia. So, the answer is -19.;
Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and they migrate to warmer countries during winter. If 38 bird families migrated from Europe to Africa and 80 bird families migrated from Europe to Asia, then we need to find out how many bird families remained in Europe. So, the number of bird families that stayed in Europe is equal to 18 - (38 + 80) = 18 - 168 = -140. Therefore, there are -140 bird families that migrated to Europe for the winter season.;
Response:  We know that there are already 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living nearby will be:  $87 + 18 = 105$  Therefore, currently, $105$ bird families live near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that 49 bird families live near the mountain during winter and 59 bird families migrated to warmer areas for winter. So, the total number of bird families in the area is 49 + 59 = 108. Since 24 new bird families arrived from the north, there are now 108 - 24 = 84 bird families living near the mountain. Therefore, 84 bird families remain near the mountain after migration.;
Response:  We know that 27 bird families migrate to warmer countries during winter and there are initially 41 bird families living near the mountain. If 27 bird families migrate, then the number of bird families remaining in the area is:  Number of bird families remaining = Initial number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated = 41 - 27 = 14 bird families.;
Response:  If 86 bird families migrated from the nearby mountains to warmer climates for winter, and there were initially 45 bird families living in the mountainous area, then we can calculate the number of bird families that stayed behind as follows: Number of bird families staying = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated = 45 + (86 x 0.5) = 45 + 43 = 88 bird families.;
Response:  We know that 41 bird families live near the mountain. If 35 bird families went to Asia and 62 bird families went to Africa, then we can calculate how many bird families went to Africa as follows: Number of bird families in Africa = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families in Asia = 62 - 35 = 27 bird families Therefore, 27 bird families went to Africa.;
"Response: 1) The number of bird families that migrate to warmer countries is given as ""a lot"". 2) There are three bird families that live near the mountain. 3) Twenty-six new bird families have arrived in the nearby mountains from the Arctic region. 4) Two bird families moved south for the winter. So, the number of bird families left near the mountain after all these movements is:  Number of bird families near the mountain = 3 + 26 - 2 = 27
Therefore, there are 27 bird families left near the mountain after all the migrations and movements.";
Response:  If Paul received 253 candies for his birthday and he either lost or gave away 70 books, then we can deduce that he has 183 candies left (253 - 70 = 183). So, there are 183 ceruzás left at the end of the school year.;
Response:  We know that Paul received $X$ pencils for his birthday. By the end of the school year, he had lost or given away $551$ pencils, leaving him with $Y = X - 551$ pencils. Since he only gave away $177$ pencils during this time period, we have $Y = X - 177$. Solving for $X$, we get $X = 177 + 551 = 728$. So, Paul received $728$ pencils for his birthday.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 440 pencils in total and gave away 111 during the school year. This means he has 329 pencils left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that 106 pencils were lost. So, the number of pencils Paul has left is 329 - 106 = 223 pencils. Therefore, there are 223 pencils left.;
Response:  If Paul received 65 ceramic pens for his birthday and gave away 213 during the school year, then he lost or sold 16 ceramic pens. Therefore, the answer is 16.;
"Response: 
Paul gave away 589 pencils in total (including those he kept for himself).
He gave away 571 pencils during the school year and lost 161 pencils.
So, he gave away more pencils than he lost. Therefore, the number of pencils he gave away to his friends minus the number he lost is equal to the total number of pencils he gave away.
In other words, 571 - 161 = 410.
Therefore, Paul gave away 410 pencils to his friends.";
"Response: 
Paul gave away $90$ ceramic pencils to his friends during the school year and lost $412$ himself. So he has $412 - 90 = 322$ left. Therefore, he lost $322 - 412 = -190$ ceramic pencils as gifts to his friends.";
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 ceramics during the school year and lost 558 of them. So he has 332 left. Now we want to find out how many ceramic he got for his birthday. To do this, we can divide the number of ceramics he had left (332) by the number of people who received one (558). This gives us the number of ceramics each person received: 332 / 558 = 0.61 or approximately 1/1.7. Therefore, Paul received 1/1.7 or approximately 0.64 ceremonies for his birthday.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 100 ceruzás at first (his birthday). Then he gave away 52 during the school year, leaving him with 49. Now we are told that he lost or gave away 535 more ceruzás. So, if he only has 492 left, then he must have given away 67 ceruzás (535 - 492 = 67). Therefore, 67 of his friends received ceruzás from him.;
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 521 pens and gave away or lost 66 of them. So he has 521 - 66 = 455 pens left. But then we are told that he still has 154 pens at the end of the school year, which means that he must have given away or lost some more pens after having 455. Therefore, the number of pens that Paul gave away or lost is equal to the difference between the initial amount (521) and the final amount (154), i.e., 521 - 154 = 367 pens. So, Paul gave away or lost 367 pens.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 531 ceramic pencils and 38 rubber bands in the box. Then, after some time, only 391 rubber bands remained, while none of the ceramic pencils were lost. So, the number of ceramic pencils left in the box is:  Initially, there were 531 ceramic pencils. After some time, only 391 rubber bands remained (out of the initial 38). Therefore, the number of ceramic pencils remaining in the box is: 531 - 391 = 140.;
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 pencils and 406 erasers as birthday presents. At the end of the school year, he had only 336 rubber bands left, while none of his pencils or erasers were lost. So, we can conclude that there are still 265 (601 - 336) rubber bands left with Paul.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 300 pencils at first (315 - 15 = 300). Then he lost or gave away 94 pencils (291 - 94 = 207), so he has 207 pencils left. Therefore, Paul received 207 pencils for his birthday.;
"Response: 
Paul took 231 ceramic pens and gave them away as gifts during the school year. This means he has 308 - 231 = 77 ceramic pens left. So, he still has 77 ceramic pens to give away or use for other purposes.";
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 457 pieces of gum and 320 pens for his birthday. Then, after some time, he only had 523 left (including the ones he didn't lose). So, we can calculate how many pens were left using the following formula: Number of pens = Initial number of pens - Number of lost pens. In this case, the initial number of pens was 320, and the number of lost pens was 0 (since it says ""miközben egy törlőst sem vesztett el""), so the number of pens left would be: Number of pens = 320 - 0 = 320. Therefore, there are 320 pens left in the box.";
Response:  At first, there were 11 guests. Then some of them left, so the number of guests decreased to 3. So, the number of guests who did not leave is 8 (11 - 3 = 8). Therefore, 8 guests remained and did not go away.;
Response:  At first, there were 3 guests (the pincér). Then, some of them left, so there were fewer guests. But we are told that still 4 guests remained. So, the number of guests who left is equal to the number of guests remaining. In other words, 4 - 3 = 1 guest(s) left. Therefore, 1 guest(s) left.;
Response:  At first, there were no guests (i.e., $0$ guests). Then, $9$ guests arrived and stayed for some time ($9$ guests), but later left ($9$ guests $\times$ $1$ day = $9$ guests). Finally, $12$ guests remained ($12$ guests). So, the number of guests at the beginning was $0$, which is the correct answer.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 14 guests at the party (Egy pincér = 14 vendége). Then, 5 guests left (Már maradt 5 vendég), leaving us with the number of guests still present at the party. Therefore, the answer is 14 - 5 = 9 guests are still at the party.;
Response:  At first, there were 13 guests. Then some left and became 4 new customers. So, initially, there were 13 - 4 = 9 guests remaining.;
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 12 guests (vendégek). Then, 15 clients left (elmenttek), leaving 7 guests remaining (megrendelték). Finally, 14 new clients arrived (jöttek), so the total number of guests now is: 7 + 14 = 21 guests. Therefore, there are still 21 guests present in the restaurant.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 guests (pincér). Then more guests arrived and there were 8 guests in total (including both the initial 3 and the new arrivals). So, the number of new guests who arrived is equal to 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, 5 new guests arrived.;
Response:  At first, there were 8 guests. Then some left and there were still 5 guests remaining. Finally, 99 new guests arrived. So, the total number of guests at any given time was either 8 or 5 (not including the new guests). Therefore, the final number of guests is: 8 + 5 = 13.;
Response:  At first, there were 12 guests. Then some left and now there are still 14 customers. After that, 10 new customers arrived. So, in total, there are currently 24 customers (14 + 10).;
Response:  At first, Dan had $3. After he spent $2 to buy something, he was left with $1. So, his initial amount of money was $3.;
Response:  We know that Danneke had $4 and after buying something (which we don't know what), he was left with $3. So, if he bought something for $X dollars, then X = $3 - $4 = $-1. Therefore, the price of the thing Danneke bought is $1.;
"Response:  If Dannek has $4 of dollars and he bought 99 cents worth of candies for $3, then we can calculate how much money he spent as follows:

$4 x 99 = $476 (total amount spent)
So, after buying the candies, Dannek had $4 - $476 = $-472 left.
Therefore, the answer is $-472.";
Response:  If Danneke bought 2 chocolates for $4 each, then he paid a total of $8 for both chocolates. So, the cost of one chocolate is $8 / 2 = $4. Therefore, every chocolate costs $4.;
Response:  If Danneke paid $6 for something that was originally worth $3, then he got $3 worth of candy for every $6 he spent. So if he bought x candies, he paid $x/6 dollars for them. Since he paid $6 in total, we can set up the equation: $x/6 = 3. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, Danneke bought 6 candies.;
Response:  He paid $2 for the chocolate and $3 for the candy. So he spent in total $5 (2 + 3). Now we know that he had $7 to start with, so after buying these two things, he has $7 - $5 = $2 left. Therefore, he has $2 left.;
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $7 and the cost of another chocolate bar is $6. So, if he bought both bars, then the total cost would be $7 + $6 = $13. Therefore, Danneck spent $13 on the chocolate bars.;
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $3 and the cost of another chocolate bar is $2. So, if he bought two chocolate bars for $6, then he paid $3 + $2 = $5 for both chocolate bars. Therefore, he paid $5 / 2 = $2.50 per chocolate bar.;
Response:  He paid $2 for one chocolate and $3 for another chocolate. So he spent a total of $5 + $3 = $8. Therefore, he spent twice as much money on chocolate as he did on candy.;
Response:  Firstly, Danneke bought something for $8. Then his friend gave him $5. So now he has $8 + $5 = $13 left.;
Response:  If Dan-nek $3 remained after he bought a candy, and he started with $4, then he spent $1 on the candy. So, the cost of the candy is $1.;
Response:  If Danneke bought 4 dollars worth of candy for $3, then he paid $3 / 4 = $0.75 per piece of candy. Since each piece of candy costs the same amount ($, so we can say that Danneke spent a total of $0.75 x 10 = $7.50 on all 10 pieces of candy. Therefore, there is $7.50 - $3 = $4.50 left over after buying the candy.;
Response:  We know that Danneke bought 3 chocolates for $4. So, each chocolate cost $4 / 3 = $1.33.;
Response:  The cost of one chocolate bar is $5, and he bought three chocolate bars for $15. So, the total cost of buying three chocolate bars is $15. Now, let's find out how much money he spent on each chocolate bar. To do this, we need to divide the total cost by the number of chocolate bars he bought: $15 / 3 = $5 per chocolate bar. Therefore, he spent $5 more on the third chocolate bar than he did on the first two chocolate bars.;
Response:  The cost of chocolate is $7, and the cost of candy is $2. So, if he bought one piece of each, then he spent $7 + $2 = $9 on both items together. Therefore, he spent $9 / 2 = $4.50 on chocolate.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books in total and he sold 78 of them at an auction. So, we need to find out how many books are left with him now. To do this, we can divide the total number of books (115) by the number of books he sold (78). This gives us the remaining number of books with Paul = 115 / 78 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 books still left with Paul.;
Response:  At first, Paul had 137 books. Then he sold some of them at an auction and got $105 as his share. So, after selling some books, he had 105 books left with him. Therefore, in the beginning, Paul had 137 - 105 = 32 books.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and he sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling some books at the garage sale, he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left  In this case, the total number of books was 108, so let's substitute this value into the equation:  Number of books sold = 108 - 62  Number of books sold = 46  Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and then bought some at a garage sale. Let's assume he bought x number of books at the garage sale. Since he now has 151 books in total, we can write an equation as follows: 50 + x = 151. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50: x = 151 / 50 = 3. So, Paul bought 3 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had two books initially (he mentions this in his statement). Then he sold some of them at an auction and bought 150 new ones. So, after selling some books, he had fewer books than before. Now, we are told that he has 58 books now. To find out how many books he sold earlier, we can subtract the number of books he has now from the total number of books he had initially: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Current number of books  In this case, the initial number of books was 2 (mentioned in the problem), and the current number of books is 58. Therefore, the number of books sold is: Number of books sold = 2 - 58 = -56  So, Paul sold 56 books earlier.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books initially and then he sold some of them in his garage. After selling those books, he bought 42 new ones. Now we are told that he has 15 books left. So, to find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he has now from the total number of books he had at first. That is: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Current number of books  In this case, the total number of books was 21 (initially) minus the current number of books which is 15, so the number of books sold is: Number of books sold = 21 - 15 = 6 Books were sold.;
"Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and then sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Now we are told that after selling some books, he bought 38 new ones. So, his current number of books is:

New books = Old books - Sold books + New books = 71 - x + 38 = 116

Now, we want to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can substitute the value of x into the equation:

Old books = New books - Sold books + Old books = 116 - x + 71 = 45

So, Paul sold 45 books at the garage sale.";
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Books = Initial books - Sold books  Pens = Initial pens - Sold pens  Now, let's solve for the number of books sold at the garage sale:  Number of books sold = Total books - Number of books left with Paul  Number of books sold = 108 - 66  = 42  Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 51 books and 106 feathers in total. After selling some of them in the attic, he has 82 books and 14 feathers left. To find out how many feathers he sold, we can subtract the number of feathers he has now from the initial amount: 106 - 14 = 92 feathers. So, Paul sold 92 feathers in the attic.;
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 136 books and later he was left with 27 books after selling some of them at a garage sale. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows:

Initial number of books = 136
Number of books sold =?
Final number of books = 27

Now, we need to solve for the value of ""?"" (the number of books sold) in order to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that Paul sold some of his books at a garage sale. Therefore, we can subtract the final number of books from the initial number of books to get the number of books sold:

Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Final number of books
= 136 - 27
= 109

So, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale.";
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave away 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then he sold some of them in a garage sale and ended up with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books sold at the garage sale is equal to 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since negative numbers are not possible here, we can conclude that no books were sold at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 95 books and 153 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 13 fewer books (i.e., 95 - 13 = 82) and 23 fewer tollas (i.e., 153 - 23 = 130). So, the number of books sold at the garage sale is 13.;
Response:  We know that Pal had 42 quills and 143 books in his room before selling some of them at the market. After selling some of them, he has 113 books and 19 quills left. To find out how many quills Pal sold, we can subtract the number of quills he has now from the initial amount he had: 42 - 19 = 23. So, Pal sold 23 quills at the market.;
Response:  Jessica had 10 roses in the basket initially and then she cut 8 more from her garden and added them to the basket. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the basket.;
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the basket (according to the statement). Then, Jessica added more roses to the basket, making it have 23 roses now. So, the number of roses that were initially in the basket is:  Initially, there were 16 roses in the basket = 23 - 16 = 9 roses.;
Response:  We know that Jessica had 2 rózsák initially (since she dropped 4 and picked up some more). So, after picking up some more from her garden, she now has 2 + x rózsák in the basket, where x is the number of rózsák she picked up from her garden. Since she picked up 8 rózsák from her garden, we can write:  Number of roses in the basket = 2 + 8 = 10. Therefore, Jessica vagged 8 rózsák from her garden.;
Response:  Jessica had 15 roses in the basket initially. She dropped 33 roses and picked some more from her garden to add to the basket. So, she now has 17 roses in the basket. To find out how many roses she picked from her garden, we need to subtract the number of roses she dropped (33) from the total number of roses she had (15 + 33 = 48). Therefore, Jessica picked 31 roses from her garden.;
Response:  Jessica had 21 roses in the basket initially. She dropped 34 roses from the basket and picked some more from her garden to add to the basket. So, she has added 34 - 21 = 13 roses to the basket. Now, there are 15 roses left in the basket. Therefore, the number of roses that Jessica dropped from the basket is equal to the number of roses she picked from her garden minus the initial number of roses in the basket. In other words, she dropped 34 - 21 = 13 roses from the basket.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in the basket (Hét rózsa volt a vázában). Then, Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the basket (Jessica még néhány rózsát vágott a kertjéből), which increased the total number of roses to 59 (ami összesen 59 rózsát tett ki). Now, we are asked how many roses Jessica cut from the basket. Since there are now 20 roses in the basket (Most már 20 rózsa van a vázában), we can deduce that Jessica cut 39 roses from the basket (Hánnyi rózsát vágott le).;
Response:  We know that Jessica had 13 roses in the basket initially and then she cut some more from her garden to make it 21 roses total. So, we can say that the number of roses left in the garden is equal to the initial amount minus the number added to the basket. Therefore, the answer is:  Initially there were 13 roses in the basket - 13 = 0 roses left in the garden.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the basket. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden to add to the basket. We don't know exactly how many she added, but let's assume it was 3 more roses (since we are told ""nagyobb"" which means ""more"") and 4 more orchids (again, since we are told ""nagyobb""). So, now we have: 15 + 3 = 18 roses; 62 + 4 = 66 orchids. Finally, Jessica took some of these flowers from the basket again, so let's subtract those as well: 18 - x = 15 roses; 66 - y = 62 orchids, where x and y are the number of flowers taken from the basket. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 3; y = 9. Therefore, Jessica took 3 roses and 9 orchids from the basket.";
Response:  We know that Jessica had initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the basket. Then she added more roses (but not orchids) to make it 10 roses total. Finally, she cut some of both roses and orchids from her garden to add to the basket, making it have 21 orchids now. So, the number of orchids Jessica cut from her garden is: Number of orchids = Total number of orchids - Initial number of orchids = 21 - 2 = 19 orchids Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her garden.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the basket. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the basket. So now we have 12 roses in total (including both initial ones and new ones). However, we also know that Jessica did not add any orchids to the basket after cutting the existing ones. Therefore, the number of orchids remains unchanged at 3. Now let's calculate the ratio of roses to orchids: Number of roses = 12 Number of orchids = 3 Ratio of roses to orchids = 12/3 = 4 So, there are 4 times as many roses as orchids in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 orchids in the basket and Jessica cut some more from her garden to add to it. So, after she added more orchids, the total number of orchids was 20. Now, we are asked how many orchids are not roses. Since all the orchids in the basket are counted as part of the total, none of them are roses. Therefore, the answer is 20 - 12 = 8 orchids that are not roses.;
Response:  If there were originally 3 roses in the vase and Jessica took some out to put them in her garden, then we know that she took at least 16 roses from the vase (since there are now 19 roses in the vase). So, if she took 3 roses initially, then she must have taken 13 more roses later (since 16 - 3 = 13). Therefore, Jessica took 13 roses from the vase.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the basket. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden to add to the basket. After she finished, there were 91 orchids and 14 roses in the basket. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica cut as follows: Number of roses cut = Total number of roses - Initial number of roses = 14 - 13 = 1 Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from her garden.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 3 orchids in the basket. Then, Jessica added another 7 orchids to the basket. So, the total number of orchids is now 3 + 7 = 10. Next, we are told that Jessica cut some more orchids and roses from her garden. However, she did not specify how many orchids she cut. Therefore, we can assume that she cut an equal number of orchids as she added earlier (i.e., 7). Thus, the final number of orchids in the basket is 10 - 7 = 3. Finally, we know that there were originally 16 roses in the basket, and after Jessica added more roses, there were 20 roses in total. Since Jessica cut some roses too, let's say she cut half of them (i.e., 10). So, the final number of roses in the basket is 20 - 10 = 10. Hence, the answer is 3 orchids and 10 roses are left in the basket.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the basket. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the basket. So now we have 21 orchids and 22 roses in the basket. To find out how many roses are more than orchids, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the total number of flowers. Therefore, the answer is: Number of roses >orchids = 22 - 20 = 2.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the basket. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the basket. So now we have 13 orchids and 3 roses in the basket. But we also know that Jessica did not add any new orchids to the basket after she cut the ones from her garden. Therefore, the number of orchids in the basket that are not roses is equal to the original number of orchids minus the number of orchids Jessica cut from her garden. That is, 6 - 3 = 3 orchids. So, there are 3 orchids in the basket that are not roses.;
Response:  If Robin had 17 cm long hair and they cut off some centimeters from it, then the new length of her hair is 13 cm. So, she cut off 4 cm (17 - 13) from her hair.;
Response:  Before Robin cut his hair, it was 20 inches long. Now, after cutting off 10 inches, the length of his hair is 10 inches. So, to find out how long his hair was before he cut it, we can divide the original length (20 inches) by the remaining length (10 inches): 20 / 10 = 2. Therefore, Robin's hair was 20 inches long before he cut it.;
Response:  Firstly, Robin had 16 inches long hair and cut off 11 inches. Now, he has 12 inches of hair left. So, Robin's current hair length is 12 + 16 = 28 inches.;
Response:  If Robin had 19 inches of hair before and added 18 more inches, then her current length would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin has 37 inches of hair now.;
Response:  If Robin had initially 14 hairs and then shaved off 13 of them, he now has how many hairs left? So, the answer is 14 - 13 = 1 hair remaining.;
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 inches of hair (hüvely). Then she grew another 8 inches, so now she has 22 inches of hair (hüvely). Finally, she cut off 20 inches of her hair, leaving her with 2 inches (hüvely) remaining. Therefore, Robin currently has 2 inches of hair.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 glasses in his collection initially. Then he found 53 additional glasses in the park. So, we need to find out how many glasses Danny has now. To do this, we can divide the total number of glasses he found (53) by the initial number of glasses he had (12). This gives us an estimate of how many more glasses Danny has now. Therefore, the answer is 4 (53 / 12 = 4).;
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 bottles in his collection and he found some more glasses in the park. So, we can assume that he found at least 53 - 21 = 32 glasses in the park. Therefore, the answer is 32.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 63 glasses in his collection initially and he lost 51 of them while walking in the park. So, he was left with 12 (63 - 51) glasses. Now, we are told that he found 33 more glasses in the park, so his current collection is 33 + 12 = 45 glasses. Therefore, Danny had 45 glasses when he started collecting them for the first time.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 glasses and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 1 more than the number of glasses he threw away. Therefore, the answer is 36 + 1 = 37.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 42 glasses in his collection now and he threw away 63 of them in the park. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of glasses thrown away = Total number of glasses collected - Number of glasses in the collectio n Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:  Number of glasses thrown away = 63 - 42 = 21 Therefore, Danny threw away 21 glasses in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 glasses and 8 packages to start with. Then he found 28 more glasses and collected 63 additional packages. So, in total, Danny has 22 + 28 = 50 glasses and 8 + 63 = 71 packages now. Therefore, Danny initially had 50 - 22 = 28 glasses.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 22üvegcsap and 30csomagolás in his collection initially. Then he found additional 17üvegcsap and 57csomagolás in the park. So, now Danny has 22 + 17 = 39üvegcsap and 30 + 57 = 87csomagolás in his collection. Therefore, the number of csomagolások Danny had initially was 57.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 30üvegcsap and 14csomagolás in his collection. Now he has 7üvegcsap and 86csomagolás. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of üvegcsapok = Initial number of üvegcsapok + Number of üvegcsapok found  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of üvegcsapok = 30 + (7 - 14)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of üvegcsapok = 30 + (-7)  Number of üvegcsapok = 23  Therefore, Danny found 23 additional üvegcsapok in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially found 11üvegcsap and 28csomagolás in the park. Now he has 68palackcsap and 51csomagolás in his collection. So we can calculate how many more csomagolások Danny collected as follows:  Number of additional csomagolások = Total number of csomagolások now - Initial total number of csomagolások  = 51 + 68 = 129  Therefore, Danny collected 129csomagolások in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 71üvegcsap and 24csomagolasa in total initially. Then he found additional 28üvegcsap and 16csomagolasa in the park. So, his new collection is 71 + 28 = 99üvegcsap and 24 + 16 = 40csomagolasa. Therefore, Danny has 99üvegcsap and 40csomagolasa now.  As for how many üvegsapkája Danny has as a whole, we can calculate it by dividing the number of üvegcsap with the total number of items (including both üvegcsap and csomagolasa) he has:  Number of üvegsapkaja = Total number of items / Number of üvegcsap  In this case, the total number of items Danny has is 99üvegcsap + 40csomagolasa = 139. And the number of üvegcsap he has is 99/2 = 49.5. Since you cannot have half of an item, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 50. So, Danny has 50 üvegsapkája as a whole.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 10 üvegcsap and 62 csomagolást in the beginning. Then he found 27 more üvegcsap and 43 more csomagolást. So, the total number of üvegcsap he has now is 10 + 27 = 37. And the total number of csomagolások he has now is 62 + 43 = 105. Therefore, Danny has 105 csomagolásai.;
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 glasses in the park and now he has 25 left. So, if we divide 66 by 25, we get 2.6. Therefore, Danny had 26 glasses at first (rounding up to the nearest whole number).;
Response:  We know that after finding some pairs of glasses in the park, Danny now has 32 glasses in his collection.  If he had only 25 glasses before, then we can say that he found x pairs of glasses in the park. Since each pair contains two glasses, the total number of glasses he found is 2x. Therefore, the answer is 2x.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 60 old glasses in his collection before he threw them away in the park. Then, he found 58 new glasses in the same park. So, after finding these new ones, Danny now has 67 glasses in total (60 + 58 = 67). To find out how many glasses Danny had initially, we can divide the number of glasses he currently has by the number he found: 67 / 58 = 1. Therefore, Danny had 1 glass in his initial collection.;
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 50 new glasses and he had 60 in total after collecting them all. So, if we subtract the number of new ones (50) from the total number (60), we get:  
$$ \therefore Total Number = 60 - 50 = 10 $$  Therefore, Danny found $10$ more pieces of broken glass in the park than he initially had.";
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 54 glasses in his collection and then he threw away some of them in the park. He found 48 new glasses there as well. So, now he has 52 glasses in his collection. To find out how many glasses Danny threw away, we can subtract the number of new glasses (48) from the initial number of glasses (54): 54 - 48 = 6. Therefore, Danny threw away 6 glasses in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 82 pieces of packaging paper and 29 glass capsules. After collecting more items from the park, he now has 42 glass containers and 61 packages of packaging paper in his collection. So, we can calculate how many glass capsules Danny had initially as follows: Number of initial glass caps = Total number of glass containers found - (Number of new glass containers + Number of old glass containers) Initially, Danny had 29 glass capsules.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 66 packages and found 39 more in the park. So, his initial collection was 66 + 39 = 105 packages. Now he has 16 more packages, so his final collection is 105 + 16 = 121 packages. Therefore, Danny had 68 packages for the first time.;
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 package papers and 50 bottle caps in the park initially. Now he has 21 packaging boxes and 52 bottle caps in his collection. So, we can calculate how many bottle caps Danny found in the park as follows: Number of bottle caps = Total number of bottle caps found - Number of bottle caps already in his collection Total number of bottle caps found = 50 (initially) + 21 (newly found) = 71 Therefore, Danny found 71 bottle caps in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 65 packages and 5 bottles in his collection. Then he found more packages and bottles in the park, which brought the total number of packages to 31 + 9 = 40. So, Danny originally found 40 packages in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny has 11 more csomagolások and 12 more üvegsapkák than he had initially. So, if he initially had x üvegsapkák and y csomagolások, then now he has x + 11üvegsapkák and y + 12csomagolások.  Since we are asked how many üvegsapkák Danny has as a result of collecting the additional items, we can set up an equation based on this information:  Number of üvegsapkák = x + (x + 11)  Substituting the value for x from the problem statement gives us:  Number of üvegsapkák = 58 + (58 + 11)  Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  X = 47  Therefore, Danny has 47 üvegsapkák as his initial collection.;
Response:  We know that Danny had 15üvegcsap and 18csomagolasa in the beginning. Now he has 67csomagolasa and 35üvegsapkaja. So we can write an equation:  Number of plastic bags = Total number of plastic bags + Initial number of plastic bags. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of plastic bags = 67 + 15 = 82. Therefore, there are 82plastic bags in Danny's collection now.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer baracks than Steven. So if Jake has x baracks, then Steven has x + 11 = 28 baracks. Therefore, Steven has 28 baracks.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven. So, if Jake has x beans, then Steven has x + 14 beans. Since Jill has more beans than both Jake and Steven combined, we can say that Jill has at least x + 14 - 7 = 21 beans. Therefore, Jake has 21 beans.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer borsós than Steven and more borsós than Jill. So, if we compare their number of borsós directly, we can say that Jake has x borsós, Steven has y borsós, and Jill has z borsós. Since Jake has fewer borsós than Steven, we know that x < y. Also, since Jake has more borsós than Jill, we know that x > z. Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many baracks Jill has:  We are told that Steven has 19 baracks, so he must have (x + y) = 19 baracks. Since x < y, we can write y - x = 19 - (x + y). Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, Jill has z = 26 baracks.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven. So, if Jake has x beans, then Steven has x + 5 beans. Since Jill has 8 beans, we can say that Jake has x - 3 beans more than Jill. Therefore, the difference between Jake and Jill is 3 beans. So, Jake has 3 more beans than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 borsós and Steven has 11 more than Jake. So, Steven has 23 borsós (11 + 12 = 23). Now we are told that Steven has four baracks, so he has 23 - 4 = 20 baracks. Therefore, Jill has 20 - 4 = 16 baracks.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer baracks than Steven and more than Jill. So we can start with an initial estimate of Jake's number of baracks as follows:  Jake - 7 = x (since he has fewer baracks than Steven)  And we also know that Jake has more baracks than Jill:  Jake > 9 (since he has more baracks than Jill). Now we have two equations:  x + 16 = 9 (from the second equation)  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  x = 8  Therefore, Jake has 8 baracks.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer baracks than Steven and more than Jill. So we can write an equation: 
Jake - 7 = Steven + 8
Jake = 15 (since he has 7 less than Steven)
We also know that Steven has 17 baracks, so we can substitute this value in our first equation:
Jake = 15
Steven = 17 - 7 = 10
So Jill has 10 baracks.";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven and more beans than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x beans, then Steven has x + 16 beans (since he has 16 more beans than Jake) and Jill has x - 9 beans (since she has 9 fewer beans than Jake). Therefore, the number of beans Steven has is equal to x + 16 =?.;
Response:  We know that Barack Obama had fewer than six baracks than Steven. So, Steven has at least 6 + 1 = 7 more baracks than Barack Obama. Now we know that Steven has 18 baracks and Jill has 5 baracks. Therefore, Jake has 18 - 5 = 13 baracks.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven. If Jake has x beans, then Steven has x + 5 beans. Since Steven has 18 barrels of beans, and each barrel contains 30 pounds of beans, we can calculate how many pounds of beans Steven has:  So, if Jake has x beans, he has 3x pounds of beans. Now, let's find out how much beans Jake has compared to Jill:  Therefore, Jake has 3x - 87 = 293 pounds of beans less than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven. So, if Jake has x beans, then Steven has x + 15 beans.  Now we know that Jill has 12 beans more than Steven. Therefore, Jill has (x + 15) + 12 = x + 27 beans.  Since Jake has fewer beans than Steven, Jake has less than x + 27 beans. So, the difference between Jake and Jill is at least x + 27 - (x + 15) = 12 beans.  Hence, Jill has at least 12 more beans than Jake.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer baracks than Steven. So, if Jake has x baracks, then Steven has x + 19 baracks. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
Jake - 12 = (Steven - 19)
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:
(Steven - 19) = Jake
Now, let's solve for Jake:
Steven = Jake + 19
So, there are 12 less baracks in Jake's collection than in Steven's collection. And since Steven has 79 more almonds than Jake, we can conclude that Jake has 79 almonds. ";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer baracks than Steven. So, if Jake has x baracks, then Steven has x + 3 baracks.  Moreover, we know that Jake has more almonds than Steven. So, if Jake has y almonds, then Steven has y - 9 almonds. Therefore, the number of almonds Jake has is 9 - (x + 3) = y.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  x + 3 = 13  Solving for x, we get:  x = 10  Therefore, Jake has 10 almonds.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer barrels than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: Barrels = 8 + 6 = 14 Apples =?
Steven: Barrels = 17 Apples =?
From here, we can see that Steven has 3 more barrels than Jake (17 - 14 = 3), so he must have 3 more apples than Jake as well (since one barrel is equal to 16 apples). Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jake has and the number of apples Steven has is 3.
So, the answer to the question ""How many more apples does Steven have than Jake?"" is 3.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 10 more almonds than Steven. So, if we write it mathematically, we have:
Apples: Jake - 3 = 10 (almonds)
Now, let's convert both quantities to the same unit of measurement, say, apples. Since Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven, Jake has 3 less than 12 (Steven's number of apples). Therefore, Jake has 9 apples (12 - 3 = 9):
Jake has 9 apples.
So, the difference between the number of almonds and apples is 6 (10 - 9 = 6).";
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven. If Jake has x beans, then Steven has 67 - x beans. Since Jill has 4 fewer beans than Steven, Jill has 67 - (x - 4) beans. Now we can find out how many beans Jake has by subtracting the number of beans he has from the total number of beans Jill has: Jake has x beans. Therefore, the answer is x = 53.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 borsós and Steven has 8 more than Jake, so Steven has 12 + 8 = 20 borsós.  Since Jill has fewer borsős than Steven, Jill must have x borsős where x is less than or equal to 20. Therefore, Jill has at most 20 - x borsős. So, Jill has at least 20 - x borsős. Now we can find out how many borsős Jill has by solving for x in the equation 20 - x = number of borsős Jill has. Solving for x, we get x = 18. Therefore, Jill has 18 borsős.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer beans than Steven (19 - 12 = 7). So, Jake has 7 more beans than Jill (72 - x = 7). Therefore, Jake has 7 + x = 79 beans in total.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer beans than Steven and 3 more beans than Jill. So, if we let S represent the number of beans Steven has (in this case, 14), then we can write the equation:
Jake = S - 6 + 3 =?
Substituting the value for S from the problem, we get:
Jake = 14 - 6 + 3 = 9
So, there are 9 beans in Jill's bowl.";
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's total number of fruits. According to the problem statement, Jake has 84 fruit pieces in total, including both apples and oranges. Since Steven has 10 fewer oranges than Jake, Steven has 84 - 10 = 74 orange pieces in total. Now, let's find out how many oranges Jake has. As per the problem statement, Jake has 52 apples and 32 less than Steven has oranges, so Jake has 52 + (74 - 32) = 66 oranges. Therefore, Jake has 66 oranges.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 4 apples (since he has 4 more apples than Jake). Now we are told that Jake has 13 apples and Steven has 17 orange juice boxes (which is not relevant to this problem). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = 13 - 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, Jake has 9 apples.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer baracks than Steven and 10 more almonds than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: Baracks = 20 (since he has 8 fewer than Steven) Almonds = 30 (since he has 10 more than Steven)
Steven: Baracks = 30 (since he has 11 more than Jake) Almonds = 20 (since he has 18 more than Jake)
Now, let's compare their number of baracks to see how many more or less Steven has than Jake:
Baracks: Jake - 30 (Steven's amount) = -5 (Since Jake has 5 fewer baracks than Steven)
So, Steven has 5 more baracks than Jake.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 4 more pears than Steven. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: Apples - 3 = x Pears
Steven: Apples = 19 Pears = y
From here, we can set up two equations using these values:
x + 4y = 3 (Since Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven)
x + y = 15 (Since Jake has 4 more pears than Steven)
Now we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can add equation 2 to equation 1:
x + y = 15 + 4(3) = 15 + 12 = 27
So, Jake has 27 pears and Steven has 19 apples. Therefore, Steven has 8 more apples than Jake.";
Response:  First, we know that $78 was in Olivia's wallet initially. Then, she spent $15 at a supermarket. So, her new balance is: $78 - $15 = $63. Therefore, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet.;
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and had $33 left over, then she must have started with an amount of money that is equal to $78 - $33 = $45. So, Olivia initially had $45.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that $100 was in Olivia's wallet initially. Then she withdrew $148 from an ATM, so now she has $100 + $148 = $248. Finally, after visiting the supermarket, she spent some money and had $248 - $X = 159, where X is the amount she spent at the supermarket. Therefore, the answer is $X = 90.;
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her purse initially. Then she withdrew $49 from an ATM. So, the total amount of money she had was: $3 + $49 = $52. Later, she spent $49 at the supermarket, leaving her with $3 again. Therefore, the amount of money she collected from the ATM is: $49 - $49 = $0.";
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her purse initially. Then she withdrew $91 from an ATM, so now she has $53 + $91 = $144. After buying things at the supermarket, she was left with $144 - $14 = $130. Therefore, Olivia spent $130 at the supermarket.";
Response:  We know that $106 was in Olivia's purse and after visiting the supermarket and art gallery, $63 remained (since $49 was spent at the art gallery). So, Olivia spent $49 at the art gallery.;
Response:  After Olivia left the supermarket, $29 remained in her wallet. If she had initially $54 in her wallet, then she spent $29 + $54 = $83.;
"Response:  If $38 was spent and initially there were $128 in the wallet, then we can calculate how much money is left as follows:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, there are $90 remaining in the wallet after spending $38 at the supermarket.";
Response:  If Dave-nek had 19 applications installed on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then there are 14 remaining applications on his phone. So, the answer is 14.;
Response:  At first, there were $18$ applications on Dave-nek's phone. After $5$ of them were deleted, there were $13$ remaining apps. So, initially, there were $18$ applications on Dave-nek's phone.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications on his phone initially and added 11 new ones. So, in total he had 21 applications (10 + 11 = 21). Now we are told that after some modifications, 4 of them remained on his phone. Therefore, the number of applications that Dave deleted is 21 - 4 = 17.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications installed on his phone initially. Then, he added 89 new applications and deleted some of them, resulting in 24 remaining apps. So, to find out how many applications were added, we need to subtract the number of applications deleted from the total number of new applications added. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of applications added = 89 - 24 = 65.;
Response:  We know that Dave added 71 new applications to his phone and then deleted some of them, leaving 14 remaining. To find out how many he deleted, we can divide the number of new applications he added by the number remaining after deletion: $ \frac{71}{14} = 5$. So, Dave deleted 5 applications from his phone.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).;
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he had 3 applications and 7 files left. So, we can calculate the number of files deleted as follows: Number of files deleted = Total number of files - Remaining number of files = 21 - 7 = 14 files. Therefore, Dave deleted 14 files from his phone.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially.  After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, the number of applications remaining on his phone after deleting some of them is:  Number of applications = 21 - 15 = 6 applications. Similarly, the number of files remaining on his phone after deleting some of them is:  Number of files = 4 - 24 = -20 files (since we subtracted the initial number of files from the total number of files deleted). Therefore, there are 6 applications and -20 files remaining on Dave's phone after deleting some of them.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially.  When he deleted some of them, 6 applications and 15 files were left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of remaining apps = Initial number of apps - Deleted apps Number of remaining files = Initial number of files - Deleted files Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of remaining apps = 19 - (6 + 15) = 19 - 21 = -2 Number of remaining files = 18 - (15 + 6) = 18 - 22 = -4 Therefore, there are -2 applications and -4 files left on Dave's phone after deleting some of them.;
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications installed on his phone and he added some more, then he has 18 applications installed now. So, the number of new applications that were added is 18 - 17 = 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and applications on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 47 applications (59 - 12 = 47) and 27 files (59 - 30 = 27).;
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 17 applications and 21 files left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: Number of files = 21 ( after deleting some) - 17 ( number of apps remaining ) Number of apps = 17 ( after deleting some) - 24 (number of apps original) Now let's solve for each variable separately: For number of files: 21 - 17 = 4 files were deleted. Therefore, Dave deleted 4 files from his phone. For number of apps: 17 - 24 = -7 apps remained on Dave's phone. Therefore, Dave had 7 fewer apps on his phone after deleting some of them.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. To find out how many applications were left on his phone after deleting the files, we can subtract the number of files from the total number of applications: Number of applications = Total number of applications - Number of files = 12 - 5 = 7 Therefore, there were 7 applications left on Dave's phone after he deleted the files but not the applications.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone initially.  When he deleted some of them, 24 files and 2 applications remained. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of remaining files = Initial number of files - (Number of deleted files + Number of deleted applications) Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of initial files = 11 Number of deleted files = 24 (as mentioned in the problem) Number of deleted applications = 3 (mentioned in the problem) Substituting these values into the above equation, we get: Number of remaining files = 11 - (24 + 3) Number of remaining files = 11 - 27 Number of remaining files = -16 Therefore, there are 16 fewer files left on Dave's phone after deleting some of the applications and files.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards initially and gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards left with Nell is:  Number of cards left with Nell = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, there are 106 cards left with Nell.;
Response:  We know that Jeff got 301 cards from Nell and now he has 154 left. So, initially, Nell had 301 - 154 = 147 cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, Jeff now has 252 cards (half of 528). Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards (528 - 252 = 276).;
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now, Jeff has 535 cards, so we can calculate the number of cards that Nell gave him as follows: Number of cards given by Nell = Total number of cards - Number of cards left with Jeff = 566 - 535 = 31 Therefore, Jeff now has 234 cards.;
"Response:  We know that:
Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave 356 to Jeff. So, now Nell has 415 - 356 = 69 baseball cards left.
Jeff had 356 10-card sets, so he has 356 x 10 = 3560 10-card sets in total.
Now, we want to find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Jeff has 10-card sets.
So, let's divide the number of baseball cards Nell has (69) by the number of 10-card sets Jeff has (3560):
69 / 3560 = 0.192 or approximately 19%.
Therefore, Nell has approximately 19% more baseball cards than Jeff has 10-card sets.";
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card packages remaining. So, we can calculate the number of ten-card packages Nell had initially as follows: Number of ten-card packages = Total number of cards - Number of baseball cards Given: Total number of cards = 246 + 214 = 460 Number of baseball cards = 404 - 246 = 158 Therefore, Nell had 158 ten-card packages initially. Now, let's find out how many more or fewer ten-card packages Nell has than baseball cards: Difference between ten-card packages and baseball cards = Number of ten-card packages - Number of baseball cards = 158 - 404 = -246 So, Nell has 246 fewer ten-card packages than baseball cards. In other words, for every 10 baseball cards Nell has, she has 246 fewer ten-card packages.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards initially and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she has 210 cards left. So, if she gave X cards to Jeff, then the total number of cards she gave away is equal to 573 - 210 = 363. Since she gave more cards to Jeff than to John (as mentioned in the problem), we can conclude that X > 195. Therefore, Nell gave at least 248 cards to Jeff.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card decks initially.  She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she has fewer cards now.  Specifically, she has 55 ten-card decks and 178 baseball cards left.  To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card decks, we can divide the number of baseball cards by the number of ten-card decks:  Number of baseball cards = 178  Number of ten-card decks = 55  So, Nell has 323 more baseball cards than ten-card decks (178 - 55 = 323).;
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card sets. So she had in total 239 + 38 = 277 cards. Now, we are told that she gave some of her cards to Jeff. Let's assume that she gave him 50 cards (this is just an assumption, as we don't have any information about how many cards she gave him). So, after giving them away, Nell had 277 - 50 = 227 cards left. Now, let's find out how many more ten-card sets Nell has than baseball cards. We know that she has 376 ten-card sets, so the number of ten-card sets minus the number of baseball cards is: 376 - 227 = 149. Therefore, Nell has 149 more ten-card sets than baseball cards.;
Response:  If Paco had 19 sweets at first and he ate 35 of them, then he must have eaten half of the original amount (since 35 is half of 74). So, Paco ate 19 / 2 = 9 sweets initially.;
Response:  If Paco ate 28 sweets and he ate some of them, then he had less than 28 sweets left. So, if he had 7 sweets left, that means he ate 21 sweets (28 - 7 = 21). Therefore, Paco ate 21 sweets.;
Response:  Paco initially had 40 süteményt (cookies). He then ate two of them. After that, he ate another 37 cookies. So, how many cookies did Paco have left? Well, if he started with 40 and ate 2, then he had 38 cookies left. And if he ate another 37, then he had 0 cookies left. Therefore, the answer is 0.;
Response:  Paco initially had 25 slices of bread. He ate 5 of them. Then he took another 3 slices. So, how many slices of bread did Paco eat in total at the bakery?  Total = Initial amount + Amount eaten = 25 + 5 = 30 slices of bread. Therefore, Paco ate 30 slices of bread at the bakery.;
Response:  Paco initially had 13 sütemények. He ate 2 of them, so he had 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he ate another 36 sütik, which means he had 11 + 36 = 47 sütik left after that. So, the difference between the total number of sütik he ate (47) and the number he initially had (13) is 34. Therefore, the answer to the question is 34.;
Response:  Paco had 40 sweets and gave 5 to his friend. So, he has 40 - 5 = 35 sweets left.;
Response:  Paco had 17 sweets and gave 13 to his friend. So he had 17 - 13 = 4 more sweets than he gave away. Therefore, he had 4 + 14 = 18 sweets in total.;
Response:  Paco had 12 pieces of cake and he ate 16 pieces. So, he gave away 4 pieces (16 - 12 = 4). Therefore, Paco gave his friend 4 pieces of cake.;
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 22 edible sweets and 75 salty sweets in total.  From this information, we can calculate how many edible sweets Paco had left after eating them.  To do this, we need to subtract the number of edible sweets he ate from the total number of sweets he consumed.  So, if Paco ate 15 edible sweets, then he has 75 - 15 = 60 edible sweets left. Therefore, Paco has 60 edible sweets left.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has eaten 9 sweet pastries and 6 salty ones. So, he has altogether consumed 9 + 6 = 15 pastries. Now, we are told that there were 36 sweet and 3 salty pastries in total. Therefore, after Paco had eaten his share, there would be 36 - 15 = 21 sweet pastries left. Finally, since Paco ate 3 of them, there are now 21 - 3 = 18 sweet pastries remaining for him to eat.;
"Response: 
Paco ate 37 sweet and 11 salty sweets.  If he ate 5 sweet sweets and 2 salty sweets, then he ate more sweet sweets than salty sweets. So, the difference between the number of sweet sweets he ate and the number of salty sweets he ate is 5 - 2 = 3. Therefore, Paco ate 3 more sweet sweets than salty sweets.";
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 8 sweet and 6 salty sweets so far. If he wants to eat an equal number of both types of sweets, then he will have to eat half of what is left (i.e., 1/2 x 34 = 17). So, he still needs to eat 17 more salty sweets.;
Response:  At first, Paco had 37 sweets and he gave 36 to his friend. So, how many sweets did Paco have left?  We can calculate it as follows:  Number of sweets Paco had initially = 37 Number of sweets Paco gave away = 36 Now, let's find out how many sweets Paco has left: Total number of sweets Paco had = Initial number of sweets - Number of sweets given away = 37 - 36 = 1 Therefore, Paco has 1 sweet left.;
Response:  Paco had 36 sweets and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 22 sweets left (36 - 14 = 22).;
Response:  Paco ate 41 pieces of candy and gave his friend 9 pieces. So, he had 32 pieces left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more pieces, so he has a total of 50 pieces now (32 + 18 = 50). Therefore, Paco ate 50 - 9 = 41 more pieces than he gave to his friend.;
Response:  Paco had 6 pieces of cake and gave 30 to his friend. So he had 30 - 6 = 24 remaining pieces of cake. Then, he ate 23 of them. Therefore, he has 24 - 23 = 1 piece of cake left.  Hence, he gave his friend 30 - 1 = 29 pieces of cake.;
Response:  We know that there were 97 sweet and 34 salty candies in total.  Among them, 15 sweets and 56 salts belonged to Paco. So, we have to subtract these numbers from the total number of candies. The remaining amount of candy belongs to Paco. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of edible candies left for Paco = Total number of candies - (Number of sweets belonging to Paco + Number of salts belonging to Paco) = 97 - (15 + 56) = 26;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paco has eaten 26 sweet pastries and 17 salty ones. So, in total, he has eaten 43 pastries (26 + 17 = 43). Now, we are asked how many salty pastries Paco has left. We can find this out by subtracting the number of salty pastries he has eaten from the total number of pastries he had initially. Therefore, if Paco had initially 40 salty pastries (since he did not eat any sweet pastries), then he has 40 - 17 = 23 salty pastries left.;
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 pieces of candy ( both sweet and salty).  He ate 23 salty candies and 32 sweet candies. So, we can write an equation: Total number of sweets = Number of sweet candies eaten + Number of sweet candies left  Total number of sweets = 32 + 39 - 23 = 40 Therefore, Paco ate more sweet candies than he left.;
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 40 sweet and 25 salty sweets so far. If he has already eaten 28 salty sweets, then he must have eaten 13 more salty sweets than he did sweet ones (since 28 - 15 = 13). So, the number of salty sweets he will eat is 13 + 15 = 28. Therefore, the number of salty sweets he will eat is 28.;
Response:  Gwen received $7 for her birthday and spent some of it. If she had $5 left after spending some money, then she must have spent half of the amount she received ($7). So, she spent $3.50 (half of $7).;
Response:  Gwen received $8 for her birthday and spent $8. So she has $0 left. Now let's calculate how much money Gwen got from her friends: Total amount of money given to Gwen = $8 (amount she received) - $8 (amount she spent) = $0 (nothing). Therefore, Gwen did not receive any money from her friends.;
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mother and $4 from her father, so she has a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she has $3 left. So, Gwen has $3 remaining.;
Response:  The girl received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father for a total of $13. If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, the amount of money that the mother gave to the girl is $8, and the amount given by the father is $5.;
Response:  The girl received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father. If she spent $4, then she has $3 + $6 = $9 left with her. So, the father gave her $9, not $6. Therefore, the father gave her more money than the mother did.;
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother for her birthday. If she spent $4 of it, then she has $9 left ($5 + $7 - $4). So, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her father did.";
Response:  The total amount of money that Gwen received is $5 + $2 = $7 from her father and mother respectively. So, she received $7 from her father and $2 from her mother in total.;
Response:  We know that John had 9 balls in his collection and lost some of them. If he has 4 balls now, then he must have lost 5 balls (9 - 4 = 5). So, John lost 5 balls.;
Response:  We know that John lost 21 golf balls and now has 12 left. So initially he had 33 (21 - 12 = 33) golf balls in his collection.;
Response:  If John had 19 golf balls in his collection and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 golf balls left (19 - 11 = 8). Now, if he found 5 new golf balls, then he has a total of 13 golf balls (8 + 5 = 13) now. So, John currently has 13 golf balls in his collection.;
Response:  If John had four bullets in his collection and lost six, then he has -6 (six minus four) bullets left. He also found eight new ones, so he now has +8 (eight plus zero) bullets in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of bullets he lost and the number he found is equal to 8 - (-6), which simplifies to 14. So, John lost 14 bullets and found 8 new ones.;
Response:  If Joshna had 7 goals in his collection and lost 8, then he has 7 - 8 = 9 remaining goals. But then he found 10 new ones, so he now has 9 + 10 = 19 goals in total. Therefore, the answer is 19.;
Response:  If John had 21 golf balls in his collection and he found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 golf balls left in his collection now.;
"Response: 
Josh had 20 golf balls in his collection initially. 
Jack took 2 golf balls from Josh's collection. So, now Josh has 18 golf balls left (20 - 2 = 18).";
"Response: 
Josh had 22 golf balls in his collection initially. Then Jack gave him 20 more golf balls. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 golf balls in his collection.";
"Response:  If Josh had 19 goals before and he scored 11 more, then his current number of goals is:

19 + 11 = 30

So, there are currently 30 golf balls in Josh's collection.";
Response:  If John had 22 bullets in his collection and he found one more bullet, then he has 23 bullets now. So, if he found 13 bullets that match the ones he already had, then he has 36 bullets (23 + 13) in total. Finally, if he found 5 bullets that do not match the others, then he has 41 bullets left (36 - 5). Therefore, John currently has 41 bullets in his collection.;
Response:  If John had 15 balls in his collection and he found 9 of them, then he has 6 balls left (15 - 9 = 6). Now, if he lost 23 balls, then he has 6 + 23 = 29 balls left in his collection. So, he vested 23 - 6 = 17 balls.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that John had 3 balls in his collection initially. Then he found 6 more balls and added them to his collection. So, now he has 3 + 6 = 9 balls in total. Finally, he lost 5 balls, so he is left with 9 - 5 = 4 balls. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 4 tons of pigs (4 ft = 480 lb). If Marco has 20 kg of apples, then his weight is 20/1000 th of the total weight of the pigs, which is 480 lb / 1000 = 0.48 tons. So, Marco's apples are 0.48 tons heavier than his father's.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 35 pounds of pigs (Marco has 13 pounds), then his father must have had 22 pounds of pigs (35 - 13 = 22). Now, if Marco's eel weighs 13 pounds, then his father's eels must weigh twice as much, or 26 pounds (2 x 13 = 26). Therefore, Marco's father's eels are 26 pounds heavier than Marco's eel.;
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 20 pounds of meat (which is equal to 9 kg). Since Marco's father is heavier than him, we can assume that Marco has less weight than his father. So, if Marco's weight is x pounds, then his father's weight must be greater than x pounds. Therefore, Marco's weight = 9 kg - 7 kg = 2 kg.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together had $X$ pounds of ground beef, and they each paid $Y$ pounds per pound, then the total amount they paid would be: $$ Total = X \times Y = (8 + 32) \times Y = 40 \times Y $$ Since there are 160 pounds in a ton, we can convert the total amount to tons as follows: $$ Ton = Total / 160 = 40 / 160 = 0.25 \text {tons} $$ So, Marco and his father together had $0.25$ tons of ground beef.;
"Response: 
Marco and his father collected a total of 24 pounds (ft) of pork. On their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds (ft). So now Marco has 15 pounds (ft) of pork left.
Since Marco's father had 3 feet (ft) more than Marco, we can say that Marco's father had 18 pounds (ft) of pork left after Marco lost 9 pounds (ft). Therefore, Marco's father originally had 27 pounds (ft) of pork (18 + 9 = 27).";
"Response: 
Marco and his father collected a total of 22 kg (kilograms) of pork. Then, Marco's father lost 8 kg (kilograms) of pork. So, the total weight of the pork that Marco's father had was 22 - 8 = 14 kg (kilograms).
Now, we are told that Marco's apple tree now has 12 kg (kilograms) of apples. Since Marco's father did not have any apples, it means that all of the 12 kg (kilograms) of apples belong to Marco. Therefore, the weight of Marco's apple tree is 12 kg (kilograms).";
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 22 pounds of pork (Marco's share is not specified). Then, Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of pork (again, Marco's share is not specified). Finally, we are told that Marco's asparagus now weighs 14 kilograms (or 30.86 pounds). So, to find out how much weight Marco's father added to their total collection, we can subtract the weight of what they already had from the new amount: 30 - 22 = 8 kilograms (or 17.64 pounds). Therefore, Marco's father added 8 kilograms (or 17.64 pounds) of pork to their total collection.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 30 kg of weight from pigs (Marco has 15 kg), then Marco's father must have had an additional 15 kg of weight from pigs. So, Marco's father had 45 kg of weight from pigs.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 30 pounds of ham (Marco has 15 pounds), then their combined weight is 30 + 15 = 45 pounds.  Since they together weigh 45 pounds and a piglet weighs 17 pounds, we can calculate that Marco's ewes weigh 45 / 2 = 22.5 pounds each. Therefore, Marco's sheep are heavier than his father's by 22.5 - 17 = 5.5 pounds.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 26 pounds of pigs (Marco has 10 pounds), then Marco's father must have had 16 pounds of pigs (26 - 10 = 16). Now, if Marco's father's eel weighs x pounds, then Marco's eel weighs x / 2 pounds, since they are equal in weight. So, to find out how much heavier Marco's eel is than his father's, we can divide the weight of Marco's eel by twice the weight of his father's eel: x / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 pounds. Therefore, Marco's eel is 8 pounds heavier than his father's eel.;
"Response: 
Marco and his father together have 30 pounds of meat (30 ft). If Marco's father had 11 pounds of ham (11 ft), then Marco must have had 29 pounds of ham (29 ft).";
Response:  We know that initially there were two children who traveled on the bus. Then, some more children got on at the bus stop. So, the total number of children on the bus is equal to the initial number plus the new number of children who got on at the bus stop. In this case, we are given that there were 10 children on the bus when it arrived at the bus stop. Therefore, the number of children who got on at the bus stop is 10 - 2 = 8.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children on the bus and then 38 more got on at the stop. So, in total, we have:  Number of children on the bus = Initial number + New number = 26 + 38 = 64 children are on the bus. Therefore, there are 64 children on the bus.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially ""néhány"" (some) children on the bus, and then two more got on at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus is:  Initially: +2 = 41 children on the bus. Therefore, before the stop, there were 39 children on the bus.";
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children on the bus. Then we are told that some of them got off at the bus stop. So, let's assume that x number of children got off the bus. Now, we have to find out how many children remained on the bus. Since 21 children remained on the bus, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children who got off = Total number of children - Number of children remaining on the bus  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of children who got off = 43 - 21  = 22  Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.;
Response:  At first, there were 41 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop (we don't know how many). So, the number of children left on the bus is 41 - x, where x is the number of children who got off. Now we are told that 18 children are still on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off = 18 - x. Solving for x, we get x = 23. So, there were 23 children on the bus when it departed from the bus stop after some of them got off.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 21 children were on the bus initially (as per the question). Then, 10 children got off at the bus stop (also mentioned in the question). So, the total number of children on the bus after 10 children got off is: 21 - 10 = 11. Now, some other children boarded the bus while others left it (not specified how many), so the final number of children on the bus is: 11 + x, where x is the unknown quantity. Since there are no additional information about the number of children who boarded or left the bus, we can conclude that x = 0, i.e., 11 children remained on the bus throughout its journey. Therefore, the correct answer is: 11.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 63 children got off the bus at the stop. So, the number of children who were already on the bus when it left the depot is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who got off at the stop. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus = Total - Number of children who got off.  In this case, the total number of children = 14 (as given in the problem). Now, let's substitute the values and solve for x (the number of children who boarded the bus):  Total = 14 (given) Children who got off = 63 (given) Boarded = Total - Number of children who got off  Substituting the values, we get: 14 = 103 - 63  Solving for x, we get: x = 40  Therefore, there were 40 children who boarded the bus.;
Response:  We know that 36 children boarded the bus and 68 children got off at the stop. So, the number of children who remained on the bus is:  $36 - 68 = -32$  Children. Since there are no negative numbers of children on the bus, we can conclude that $0$ children got on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who were originally on the bus: $68 = 36$.  So, $42$ children got off the bus.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 22 children boarded the bus initially. Then, 40 children got off the bus at the stop, leaving 22 - 40 = 2 children remaining on the bus. Therefore, two children were left on the bus when it arrived at its destination.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 82 children got off the bus at the stop (as mentioned in the question). So, the number of children who were already on the bus when it left the depot is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who got off at the stop. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus = Total - Number of children who got off.  In this case, the total number of children = 30 (since there are 30 children on the bus). Now, let's find out how many children got off the bus. We can do this by subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children: Number of children who got off = Total - Number of children on the bus.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children who got off = 82 - 30 = 52.  Therefore, 52 children got off the bus at the stop, and 28 children remained on the bus. So, 28 children boarded the bus.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children on the bus and then 4 more got off at the stop (as mentioned in the question). So, the total number of children who boarded the bus = 23. Now, we are asked how many children got off the bus. Since 4 children got off, the number of children left on the bus = Total number of children who boarded the bus - Number of children who got off = 23 - 4 = 19. Therefore, 19 children remained on the bus after some got off.;
Response:  If Pékség made 133 sweets and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 sweets left (133 - 51 = 82). Now, we need to find out how many sweets Baker made if he sold as many as Pékség had left. So, Baker made 82 / 51 = 160 sweets.;
"Response:  If they made 54 scones and sold 13 of them, then the number of scones they have left is:

$$ \text {Number of scones left} = \text{Total number of scones made - Number of scones sold} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of scones left} = 54 - 13 = 41 $$

Therefore, there are 41 scones left.";
"Response:  We know that 145 pieces were sold and there are still 72 left. So, if we subtract the number of pieces sold from the total number of pieces, we get:

Total number of pieces = Number of pieces sold + Number of pieces remaining
= 145 - x
where x is the number of pieces Baker baked initially.
Solving for x, we get:
x = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces sold
= 145 - 145
= 0
So, Baker did not bake any sütemények. The correct answer is (0).";
"Response:  If Pékség made 155 sütemények and took 140 of them from Baker, then we can calculate how many are left for Baker as follows:

Total number of sütemények = 155
Number taken by Baker = 140

So, the number of sütemények left for Baker is:

Number of sütemények left for Baker = Total number of sütemények - Number taken by Baker
= 155 - 140
= 15

Therefore, there are 15 sütemény left for Baker.";
Response:  We know that the bakery made 121 scones and sold 105 of them. So, there are 16 (121 - 105) scones left in the bakery.;
Response:  We know that Pékség made 13 sweet treats and sold 91 of them. So, we can say that Pékség has 91 - 13 = 78 unsold sweets left. Now, let's see how many new sweets Baker took from Pékség. According to the question, Baker took 154 new sweets. Since Baker didn't sell any sweets himself (he only bought), he must have taken all of the remaining 78 unsold sweets from Pékség. Therefore, the number of sweets Baker took is equal to 78.;
Response:  The bakers made 170 sweets and sold 78 of them. So they have 92 unsold sweets (170 - 78 = 92). They also took 31 new sweets to sell. Therefore, the number of sweets that the bakers gave away is equal to the number of sweets they took with them minus the number of sweets they already had (31 - 92 = -61). So, the bakers did not give any sweets away.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 110 sütemények were made and 75 of them (75 x 100 = 7500) were sold. Then, they baked another 76 sütemények. So, the total number of sütemények left in the oven is: 7500 + 76 = 7576. Therefore, there are 7576 sütemény left in the oven.;
Response:  We know that Pékség made 144 scones and sold 71 of them. So, we have to find out how many more scones he made than those he sold.  To do this, we can subtract the number of scones sold from the total number of scones made: 144 - 71 = 73. Therefore, Baker made 73 additional scones beyond what was sold.;
Response:  We know that Pékség made 149 sweets and sold 10 of them. So, he has 139 sweets left (149 - 10 = 139). Then we are told that Pékség also sold 90 more sweets. Therefore, after selling these additional sweets, he will have 49 sweets left (139 - 90 = 49). Thus, there will be 49 sweets left for Baker.;
Response:  The baker made 7 cakes and 148 pastries in total. If he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries, then the number of pastries left with the baker is:  Number of pastries left = Total number of pastries - Sold pastries = 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20 pastries So, there are 20 pastries left with the baker.;
Response:  We know that the baker (Pékség) made 126 scones and sold 48 of them. So, he has 78 unsold scones left. Now we are told that the baker gave away 115 scones. This means that he has 78 - 115 = 37 unsold scones left. Finally, we are told that the baker gave away 81 more scones. Therefore, the number of scones the baker actually made is 37 + 81 = 118 scones.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 19 sweets and sold 70 of them. So he must have made at least 70 - 19 = 51 sweets in total. Similarly, we know that he sold 88 sweets and made 131 sweets in total. Therefore, the number of sweets the baker made is 51 + 131 = 182 sweets.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 157 scones and sold 169 of them. So, we have to find out how many scones were left unsold. To do this, we can subtract the number of scones sold from the total number of scones made:  Number of scones left unsold = Total number of scones made - Number of scones sold  Number of scones left unsold = 157 - 169  Number of scones left unsold = -12  Therefore, there were 12 scones left unsold by the baker.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 and sold 68 scones. So, he has 54 - 68 = 14 left to sell.  Now we are asked how many scones the baker sold in total. From the previous question, we know that the baker sold 92 scones. Therefore, the total number of scones the baker sold is 14 + 92 = 106 scones.;
Response:  The baker made 44 scones initially and then sold them all. If he had made 48 scones in total, that means he would have had 48 - 44 = 14 scones left over for himself or to sell later. So, there are 14 scones remaining with the baker.;
Response:  If Pékség gave away 8 sweet treats and sold 40 tortas for the first time, then Baker must have baked at least 48 tortas (8 + 40). So, the answer is 48.;
Response:  The baker has 137 sweets and gives them to his friend as a gift. If he had made 169 sweets initially, then the number of sweets left with him would be: Number of sweets given away = 137 Number of sweets remaining = Original quantity - Gifted quantity = 169 - 137 = 32 Therefore, there are 32 sweets left with the baker.;
Response:  We know that 173 sütemények were made and 103 of them were sold. So, there are still 70 sütemények left in the bakery (173 - 103 = 70).;
Response:  We know that Pékség made 99 new sweets and bought 167 new ones. So, he has 99 + 167 = 266 sweets in total. He sold 89 sweets, so he has 266 - 89 = 177 sweets left. Therefore, Baker took 177 sweets from Pékség.;
Response:  The baker made 8 new tortes and sold them all. Then he bought 139 new tortes and sold 145 of them. So, the number of tortes that the bakers sold is equal to the number of tortes they bought minus the number of tortes they sold. In this case, it is: 139 - 145 = -6. Therefore, the bakers sold 6 tortes less than the number they bought.;
Response:  We know that the bakery made 62 scones initially and then produced additional 149 scones. If they sold all of them (144), then we can calculate how many are left in the bakery using simple subtraction: Number of scones left = Total number of scones - Number of scones sold = 62 + 149 - 144 = 3 So there are 3 scones remaining in the bakery.;
Response:  We know that:  * The baker made 81 scones initially.  * He then made an additional 92 scones.  * They sold 46 of them. So, we can write down the equation: Total number of scones = Initially made + Additional ones - Sold To calculate the total number of scones, we need to solve for X in the equation above: X = 81 + 92 - 46 X = 135 Therefore, the baker made and sold 135 scones in total.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 61 cakes and sold 108 of them. So, he has 53 left (61 - 108 = 53). Then we are told that he also sold 44 cakes. So, now he has 53 - 44 = 9 cakes left. Therefore, there are 9 cakes left for the baker.;
Response:  We know that initially, Pékség made 56 sütemények and 124 tortas. If he sold 104 sütemények and 29 süteményt, then we have to subtract these amounts from the initial total. So, the number of süteménye left with Baker is: Number of süteménye left = Initial quantity - Sold quantity = 56 + 124 - 104 - 29 = 37 sütemény. Therefore, there are 37 süteménye left with Baker.;
Response:  The baker made 52 + 84 = 136 scones in total. If he sold 102 of them and kept 94 for himself, then he must have made 136 - 94 = 42 more scones than he sold. So, the number of scones the baker made is 42.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 134 sweets and 11 tarts. If he sold 140 sweets and 92 sweets, then we can calculate how many sweets he made in total as follows:  Total number of sweets = Number of sweets sold + Number of sweets not sold = 140 + 92 = 232 sweets So, the baker made 232 sweets in total.;
Response:  We know that the baker made 14 sweet bread and 153 other sweets. If he sold 8 of them, then the number of sweets he sold is 153 - 8 = 145. So, the baker sold 145 sweets in total.;
Response:  We know that the bakery made 43 cakes and sold 114 cakes. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Bakery produced = 43 + 114 = 157 cakes. Now, let's find out how many times more cakes were sold than those produced: Number of times more = Sold - Produced = 114 - 157 = -43 times. Therefore, the bakery sold fewer cakes than they produced.;
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of games Kelly needs to buy = Total number of games - Current number of games
= 140 - 22
= 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to reach her goal of having 140 games left.";
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and sells 64 of them, then he will have 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games left. So, Kelly will receive 42 more Nintendo games if he sells 64 of his existing ones.;
Response:  If Kelly has already played 91 Nintendo games and there are still 92 more games left to play, then we can calculate the total number of games he will have played as follows: Total Number of Games = (Current Game Count) + (Number of Games Left) So, in this case, the total number of games that Kelly will have played is: Total Number of Games = 91 + 92 = 183 games. Therefore, the answer is 183.;
Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, then she has a total of 90 games (20 + 70). To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly needs to give away in order for her to have 12 Nintendo games left, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she has by the number of Nintendo games she wants to keep:  Number of Nintendo games needed = Total number of games / Desired number of Nintendo games = 90 / 12 = 7.5 So, Kelly needs to give away 7.5 Nintendo games in order to have 12 Nintendo games left.;
"Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to have 31 Sony games left after giving some away.  To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give away, we can divide the number of Sony games she has (132) by the number of Sony games she wants to keep (31):

Number of Sony games Kelly needs to give away = Number of Sony games she has - Number of Sony games she wants to keep
= 132 - 31
= 101

So, Kelly needs to give away 101 Sony games to end up with 31 Sony games left.";
Response:  We know that Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 new ones. To find out how many he needs to give away to have 6 games left, we can use division. So, we divide 80 by 31 = 2.57 (round down to 2). Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 2 games to have 6 games left.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 52 houses in total and after 38 houses remained. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Initially, there were 52 houses = Total number of houses remaining (38) x Initial number of houses (Randy-nek). Therefore, Randy had 14 houses at first.;
Response:  We know that Randy had 97 houses and he used some of them to build a tower. If he built a tower with 72 stones left after building it, then we can say that he used 25 stones (97 - 72 = 25) for building the tower.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 houses and he uses 14 of them to build a tower. So, we have 79 - 14 = 65 houses left. Now, we are asked how many houses Randy has left for building another house. Therefore, the answer is 65 - 11 = 54 houses.;
Response:  We know that Randynek has 58 houses and he uses 27 of them to build a tower. So, the number of houses used for building the tower is 27. Now, we need to find out how many houses are left after building the tower. The total number of houses available for building the house is 58 - 27 = 31. Therefore, Randynek can use 31 houses to build one house. So, if Randynek builds both the tower and the house together, he will require 27 + 31 = 58 tiles.;
"Response:  We know that Randy has 37 houses and he uses some of them for building towers and others for building his house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of houses used for tower = Total number of houses - Number of houses used for building the house  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Number of houses used for tower = 37 - (33 + 13)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of houses used for tower = 37 - 46  Solving for the value of ""Number of houses used for tower"", we get:  Number of houses used for tower = 9  Therefore, Randy used 9 houses for building the tower and 28 houses for building his house.";
Response:  We know that Randynek has 86 houses and he uses some of them for building towers and others for building houses.  The ratio of houses used for tower construction is 79/86 = 0.93 or approximately 93%. So, Randynek used 93% of his houses (or 84 houses) for building towers and 7% (or 6 houses) for building houses. Therefore, the number of houses used for house construction is 6.;
Response:  If Randy had 36 house towers and used 59 of them for his tower construction, then he must have had 27 unused house towers (36 - 59 = 27). So, there are 27 house towers left over.;
Response:  We know that Randynek has 95 houses and he uses 20 of them to build one house. So, he needs 95 / 20 = 4.75 houses to build one house. Now, we are asked how many houses Randynek used to build a tower. Since each house is equal to 4.75, Randynek used 4.75 x 50 = 237.5 houses to build the tower. Therefore, the answer is 237.5 houses.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 houses and he uses 89 of them to build one house. So, he has 1 house left over. Now, we are asked how many blocks he used to build one house. Since he has 89 blocks available for building each house, he must have used all 89 blocks to build one house. Therefore, he has 72 blocks (90 - 89) available for building his remaining 63 houses.  Now, let's calculate how many blocks he will use to build each house. If he has 72 blocks available for building each house, then he will use 63 / 72 = 0.87 blocks per house. So, he will use approximately 0.87 blocks to build each of his remaining 63 houses.;
Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series. If you have not read any of them yet, then you must have read at least 5 books already. Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the series that have already been read (according to the question), and we need to read another 8 books. Therefore, the total number of books in the series is: 13 + 8 = 21 books.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 different books in the series and you have already read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books. Therefore, the answer is: 22 - 12 = 10. So, you still need to read 10 more books from the series.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in the series. If you have read 19 books and watched 7 films, then we can conclude that you still need to watch 10 more films (17 - 7 = 10). Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series. If you have read 19 books and watched 13 films, then we can conclude that there are still 7 books left in the series (16 - 19 = 7). Therefore, there are 7 more books in the series than the ones you have read or watched.;
"Response:  We know that there are 8 different books in the series and we have read 19 of them. So, the number of films in the series is: Number of books x Number of films per book = 8 x? = 152 films. Therefore, there are 152 films in the "" Bolond, Bolond Iskola "" series based on the information provided in the question.";
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series. If you have read 13 books, then you have not seen any of the films. So, the number of books you have read is 13 - 11 = 2. Therefore, you have read 2 books more than the number of films you have seen.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in the series. If you have read 7 books, then you have not seen any of the films yet. So, the number of films you have seen is 0. Therefore, the answer to your question is 0.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series that the person has already read. So, if there are 14 books in total in the series, then we need to find out how many books the person hasn't read yet. To do this, we can subtract the number of books they have already read from the total number of books in the series:  Number of books left to read = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 - 8 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 books left to read in the series that the person hasn't read yet.;
Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books in the series. If you have watched 34 films and read 4 books, then we can calculate how many books you still need to read as follows: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books already read = 19 - 4 = 15 So, you still need to read 15 more books from the series.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series. If we have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then we still need to watch 3 more movies (since 8 - 4 = 3). So, the answer is 3.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 40 movies in the series. If we subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of books, we get: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books read = 15 - 11 = 4 So, there are 4 more books in the series than you have read or watched.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 different films in the series and we have read 13 books. So, the number of films left is:  Number of films = Total number of films - Number of films read = 17 - 13 = 4 films. Therefore, there are 4 additional films in the series beyond what we have read.;
Response:  We know that there are 10 different books and 6 different films in the series. If we assume that each book is read once, then the total number of times each book is read is 10 (since there are 10 books). Similarly, if we assume that each film is watched once, then the total number of times each film is watched is 6 (since there are 6 films). So far so good! Now comes the tricky part - how do we find out how many books you have read based on the films you have watched? To solve this problem, we need to use some clever math tricks! Here's one way to approach it:  Suppose you have watched all 6 films. Since each film is associated with 2-3 books (based on the information provided), the total number of books associated with the films you have watched is at least 6 x 2 = 12 books. However, since you may have watched more than one film per book, the actual number of books you have read could be higher than 12. For example, if you watched Film 1 twice, then you would have read 2 books associated with that film (Book 1 and Book 2). Therefore, the minimum number of books you have read based on the films you have watched is 12, but it could be higher depending on how many times you watched each film.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series. If we read 19 books and watched 16 movies, then we have already seen 19 + 16 = 35 movies. So, the number of movies left to watch is 5 - 35 = -29 movies. Therefore, you would not see any more movies as there are no negative numbers of movies.;
Response:  If Dave had 7 tickets and used them to buy games, then he must have spent at least $7 on games. Since he won some money back, let's assume that he spent exactly $7 on games. Therefore, the number of games Dave bought is equal to the amount of money he spent on games divided by the cost of each game. In this case, we know that the cost of each game is $1, so: Number of games = $7 / $1 = 7 games.;
Response:  If Dave took 12 tickets from the lottery and there are still 14 tickets left in the store, then he must have won at least 12 - 14 = 2 tickets. So, Dave won 2 tickets at the lottery.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave bought $18 worth of things. If he spent $5 on games and $11 on clothes, then he must have had $8 left over to spend on other things (or nothing at all). So, there are 8 - $5 = $3 left over for Dave after buying everything. Therefore, Dave has $3 left over.;
Response:  If Dave won $19 in total and he took $12 from the game, then he spent $7 on clothes. So, he spent more money on clothes than games. Therefore, the answer is $7$.;
"Response:  If Dave won 13 tickets and he took 8 of them for games and 18 for clothes, then we can say that the number of tickets used for clothes is equal to the number of tickets left after taking 8 for games. So, if x represents the number of tickets taken for clothes, we have:
x = 13 - 8
x = 5
Therefore, Dave used 5 tickets for clothes.";
Response:  If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, he has 16 tickets left. Since there are ten pairs of games, if Dave played each pair once, he would have used up all his tickets. So, after playing ten pairs of games, Dave would have no tickets left. Therefore, the answer is 0.;
Response:  According to the problem statement, Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the storm. If a 9-level typhoon killed all of them, then we can assume that 5 trees died (since 9 is greater than 14). So, there were 9 deaths among the survivors.;
Response:  We know that Haley had 13 trees in her backyard and all of them died except for 6 which were killed by the storm. So, we have to find out how many trees survived the storm. As there are 6 trees left alive after the storm, we can conclude that 6 - 6 = 0 trees survived the storm. Therefore, none of the remaining 7 trees survived the storm.;
Response:  We know that Haley had planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the storm (taifun), only four trees remained. So, we can conclude that 16 trees died during the storm (taifun).;
Response:  If Haley had planted $n$ trees in her backyard before the storm and $m$ of them died during the storm (including the 5-tree cluster), then after the storm, she would have $\text {${n - m}$}$ trees left. So, if $n = 12$, then $m = 7$. Therefore, Haley planted $12 - 7 = 5$ new trees.;
Response: 1) Haley initially had nine trees in her backyard. 2) After a 4-level typhoon killed them all, there were no more trees left. 3) Then she planted five new trees. So, the number of trees remaining with Haley is 5 (new ones she planted). Therefore, the answer is 5.;
Response:  After the tornado (tajfun), two trees died in Haley's backyard. If he had 12 trees before and 2 of them died, then how many trees does he have left? So, there are 10 trees left.;
Response:  After the hurricane (tajfun), 13 trees died in Haley's backyard. If they had planted 3 more trees, how many trees would have survived the storm?  We know that 10 trees survived the storm (since 13 died). So, if they had planted 3 more trees, 7 trees would have survived (10 - 3 = 7). Therefore, among the túlélőkkel (survivors) there were 7 trees.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 trees in Haley's backyard and after the tornado, two of them died. So, we have to find out how many trees survived the tornado. To do this, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the initial total number of trees. Therefore, the answer is: Surviving trees = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees = 11 - 2 = 9.;
"Response:  If they collect 66 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are collected in total as follows:

Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket
= 66 x 28
= 1904 oranges

Therefore, they collect 1904 oranges per day.";
Response:  If he picks up 8 baskets of oranges every day and there are 24 baskets in total, then it will take him... (do the calculation)...days to collect all 24 baskets.;
"Response:  If he visited the orange grove and found out that the harvest will last for another 4 days, then we can calculate how many baskets of oranges he picked up per day as follows:

Day 1: He visited the orange grove and found out about the remaining 4 days of harvest. So, he picked up x baskets of oranges on Day 1.

Days 2-4: Since he visited the grove on Day 1, he must have picked up y baskets of oranges on each of the next 3 days ( Days 2-4).

Total number of baskets = x + 3(y)

Now, we know that there are 56 baskets in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Total number of baskets = 56

Solving for y, we get:

y = 56 / 3 = 18

So, our friend picked up 18 baskets of oranges per day during the 4 days he was at the orange grove.";
Response:  If they collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges, then in one day they will collect 1560 oranges (38 x 42 = 1560). Now, if it takes 49 days to harvest all the oranges, then the total number of oranges collected will be 1560 x 49 = 76,700 oranges. So, there will be 76,700 zucchos of oranges after 49 days of harvesting.;
"Response:  If they collect 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 oranges, then in 87 days they will have collected:

66 x 25 = 1650 oranges per day
1650 x 87 = 143,500 oranges total
Therefore, there will be 143,500 oranges after 87 days of harvesting.";
Response:  If he visited the orange grove daily and collected 8 baskets per day, then the total number of oranges collected in one day is 8 x 35 = 280. So, they collect 280 oranges per day.;
Response:  We know that Azat takes 16 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 57 oranges. To find out how many days it will take to collect 80 baskets of oranges, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total amount / Amount collected per day = 80 / 16 = 5 days. Therefore, it will take Azat 5 days to collect 80 baskets of oranges.;
Response:  We know that 67 zaks of oranges are collected daily and each zak contains 12 oranges. So, in total, 67 x 12 = 804 oranges are collected daily. To find out how many baskets they collect, we need to divide the number of oranges by 35 (since there are 35 zacs). Therefore, 804 / 35 = 23.14narancshat they collect per day.;
Response:  We know that they collected 74 baskets of oranges per day and threw away 71 baskets. So, in total, they collected 74 x 30 = 2220 oranges per day. Now, we need to find out how many days it took for them to collect 51 baskets. To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges collected by the number of baskets collected per day: 2220 / 74 = 30 days. Therefore, after 30 days, they will have collected 51 baskets of oranges.;
Response:  If they collect 76 baskets of oranges per day and throw away 64 baskets, then the total number of oranges collected is 76 - 64 = 12. Since there are 50 oranges in each basket, the total number of oranges collected per day is 12 x 50 = 600. Therefore, they collect 600 oranges per day.;
Response:  We know that every day they harvest 28 zsaks of ripe oranges and 52 zsaks of unripe oranges. So in total, they collect 80 zsaks of oranges per day (28 + 52). Now we need to find out how many days have passed since the last time he visited the orange grove. If it took him 26 days to get there, then the number of days that have passed is 26 - 1 = 25 days. Therefore, after 25 days, they will have collected 25 x 80 = 2000 zsaks of oranges.;
Response:  After 25 days, there will be $82 \times 25 = 2050$ zsaks of mature oranges and $61 \times 25 = 1525$ zsaks of immature oranges. So, the total number of zsaks of orange after 25 days is $2050 + 1525 = 3575$.;
Response:  If they harvest 31 zsák of ripe oranges per day and there are 45 days until they reach maturity, then the total number of zsaks of immature oranges = Total number of zsaks of ripe oranges x Number of days until maturity - Total number of zsaks of ripe oranges. So, the number of zsaks of immature oranges = 31 x 45 - 31 = 289 zsaks.;
Response:  We know that there are 44 zsák élett narancsot and 25 zsák éretlen narancsot per day. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of érett narancse = Total number of narancse x Percentage of érett narancse  Number of érett narancse = 44 + 25 = 69 zsák/day  Now we need to find out what percentage of narancs is érett. From the question, we know that 70% of the narancs are érett. So we can use this value in our equation: Number of érett narancse = (Total number of narancs x Percentage of érett narancse) / 100  Number of érett narancse = (69 zsák/day x 70%) / 100 = 48.3 zsák/day  Therefore, we collect 48.3 zsák érett narancsot per day.;
Response:  We know that there are 74 zsák éretlen narancsot szednek naponta. If we divide this number by the total number of narancs (5 + 74 = 89), we get the proportion of éretlen narancsok to éretlen narancsok: $ \frac{74}{89} = 0.83$ or approximately 83%. So, we can say that about 83% of the narancs produced are not yet ripe.;
Response:  We collected 54 baskets of oranges in total. If we collect 18 baskets per day, then it will take us __________ days to harvest all the oranges.  Solution:  To find out how many days it took to harvest all the oranges, we need to divide the total number of baskets by the number of baskets collected per day. In this case, we have 54 baskets and we collect 18 baskets per day, so the number of days it took to harvest all the oranges is: 54 / 18 = 3 days. Therefore, it took 3 days to harvest all the oranges.;
Response:  We know that we collected 56 baskets of oranges in total. If they were collected over 14 days, then we can calculate the number of baskets per day as follows: Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days = 56 / 14 = 4 baskets per day. Therefore, they collected 4 baskets of oranges per day.;
Response:  If they harvest 25 zsacks of oranges per day and 5 zsacks of oranges per day are left to ripen for another 73 days, then the total number of zsacks of oranges that will be available after 73 days is: Total = Daily production x Number of days = 25 x 73 = 1825 zsacks So there will be 1825 zsacks of ripe oranges after 73 days.;
Response:  We know that there are currently 65 zsaks of oranges harvested per day and 46 zsaks of oranges harvested per day after 6 days. So, if we assume that the rate of maturity is constant, then the number of immature oranges (i.e., those that will become ripe in the future) can be calculated as follows: Number of immature oranges = Total number of oranges x Rate of maturity per day - Total number of oranges harvested per day After 6 days, the total number of oranges will have increased by half the daily harvest rate, so the number of immature oranges at this point will be: Number of immature oranges = 130 zsaks (65 + 46) x 0.5 - 72 zsaks (46 x 2) = 58 zsaks Therefore, there will be 58 zsaks of immature oranges after 6 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 41 zsaks of mature oranges per day and 86 zsaks of immature oranges per day. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Mature oranges = 41 x Day (where Day is the number of days since the last harvest) Immature oranges = 86 - 41 = 45 x Day Now, we need to find out how many days have passed since the last harvest. Let's assume that the last harvest was 7 days ago. Then, we can calculate the number of days since the last harvest as follows: Days since last harvest = 7 + 1 = 8 Therefore, we can substitute the value of 8 in place of 'Day' in both equations above: Mature oranges = 41 x 8 Immature oranges = 45 x 8 Solving for the number of zsaks of mature oranges per day, we get: Mature oranges = 328 Zsaks of immature oranges per day = 369 Zsaks So, the answer to the question is: There are 328 zsaks of mature oranges and 369 zsaks of immature oranges collected daily.;
Response:  We know that there are 71 zacskós of ripe oranges and 60 zacskós of ripe oranges produced daily. To find out how many unripe oranges we get per day, we need to divide the total number of oranges produced daily by the number of ripe ones. So,  $ \frac {71}{71} = 1$. Therefore, we produce $ 1 $ unripe orange for every $ 71 $ ripe oranges produced daily.;
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract their values. So, the difference between the length and width of Jesse's room is:  12 - 11 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.;
Response:  We know that Jesse has a room that is 2 meters long. If he needs a square carpet that is 4 square meters in size, then we can calculate the width of his room as follows:  Room length = 2 meters = x meters Room area = 4 square meters = x^2 meters Since the room is rectangular in shape, we can find its width (x) by dividing the room area by the length: Width = x meters = sqrt(4 / 2) = sqrt(8) = 2 meters So, the width of Jesse's room is 2 meters.;
Response:  We know that Jesse has a room that is 2 meters wide and he needs a square carpet that covers the entire floor of his room. The area of the carpet can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 2 m x 4 m = 8 sqm Now we need to find out how long the room is based on the given information. So, let's divide the area of the carpet (8 sqm) with the length of the room (which we want to find): Length = 8 / 1 = 8 m Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 8 meters.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the room is 3 meters and its width is also 3 meters. So, the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 3 x 3 = 9 square meters. Now, we are given that there are 5 square meters of carpet needed to cover the entire floor. To find out how much of the floor remains uncovered after placing the carpet, we need to subtract the area covered by the carpet from the total area of the room. Therefore, the amount of floor remaining uncovered can be calculated as follows: Remaining Floor Area = Total Room Area - Carpet Area = 9 - 5 = 4 square meters. Hence, there are 4 square meters of floor left uncovered after placing the 5-square meter carpet in the room.;
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If we convert these measurements to meters, we get:  Length = 0.6 meters Width = 3.6 meters Now, let's find out how many square meters there are in Jesse's room: Area of each cement block = length x width = 0.6 x 3.6 = 2.16 square meters Total area of all cement blocks needed to cover the entire floor = total area of one cement block x number of cement blocks = 2.16 square meters x (number of cement blocks) =? To find out how many cement blocks are needed, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of each cement block. So, if we divide 2.16 square meters by 2.16 square meters per cement block, we get: Number of cement blocks needed = total area of room / area of one cement block = 2.16 square meters / 2.16 square meters per cement block = 1 Therefore, Jesse needs 1 cement block to cover the entire floor of his room.;
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, so its area is 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. If there are 20 rooms in total, then we need to cover each room with enough carpet to cover its entire area. So, we divide the total area of all 20 rooms by the area of one room (which is 36 square meters) to get the number of pieces of carpet needed: Number of pieces of carpet = Total area of all rooms / Area of one room = 36 square meters / 36 square meters = 1 piece of carpet per room. Therefore, we only need one piece of carpet to cover all 20 rooms.;
Response:  The length of the room is given as $6$ meters and its width as $6$ meters too. So, we have: $$ L = 6 \text{ m} = 6 \times W $$ where $L$ is the length of the room and $W$ is its width. Now, we are asked how much longer the room is than its width. We can substitute the values we know into the equation above: $$ \boxed{\frac{L}{W}} = \boxed{\frac{6}{6}} = 1 $$ Therefore, the room is $1$ time longer than its width.;
Response:  We know that the area of the carpet is 4 square meters and the length of the room is 1.5 meters. To find out how wide the room is, we need to divide the area of the carpet by its length. So, if we divide 4 square meters by 1.5 meters, we get: 4 / 1.5 = 2.67 meters. Therefore, the width of the room is approximately 2.67 meters.;
Response:  If the room is two feet wide (2 ft = 0.33 yd), then it will be twice as long to accommodate the four square meters of carpet needed for the room. So, if the room is 2 ft wide, its length must be 4 ft / 0.33 yd = 12.30 yd.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much of the square carpet is needed for each side of the room. Since the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, we can calculate the length and width of each side as follows: Length = 4 feet x 12 inches/foot = 48 inches Width = 20 feet x 12 inches/foot = 240 inches Now, let's divide the total area of the room (which is equal to the product of its length and width) by the area of one square foot to find out how many square feet are needed to cover the entire floor: Total Area = Length x Width = 48 x 240 = 11,520 square inches Per Square Foot = Total Area / Number of Sides = 11,520 / 4 = 2,875 square feet Therefore, Jessene needs approximately 2,875 square feet of carpet to cover her entire room.;
Response:  We know that the Razorback polo shirt sells for $23 each and they sold $230 worth of polos during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, we can calculate the number of polos sold as follows: Number of polos = Total amount earned / Price per polo = $230 / $23 = 10 polos. So, they sold 10 polos during the game.;
Response:  The cost of one polo is $51. Since they sold 3 polos, we can multiply the cost per polo by 3 to get the total revenue from selling those polos: $51 x 3 = $153. So, each polo costs $51.;
Response:  We know that $87 is the price of each polo shirt and we have to find out how much money they sold in total. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of polos sold x Price of one polo shirt = 95 polos x $87 = $8,325. Therefore, they earned $8,325 from selling polo shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.;
Response:  We know that the total number of polo shirts sold is 242 and the Razorbacks sold 106 polo shirts for every game they played. So, if we divide the total number of polo shirts sold (242) by the number of games played (3), we get an average number of polo shirts sold per game = 80.67. Now, let's assume that 115 polo shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. If this is true, then the number of polo shirts sold during the Texas Tech game can be calculated as follows: Number of polo shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total number of polo shirts sold - Number of polo shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, 127 polo shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game.;
Response:  We know that $98 is the price of each polo shirt and 163 polos were sold in total during both games. So, the total amount of money earned from selling polo shirts is:  Total revenue = Number of polos sold x Price per polo = 163 x $98 = $15,744. Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $15,744 from selling polo shirts during the two games.;
Response:  We know that $78 is the price of each polo shirt and we have sold 186 polos in total. So, if we sell 172 polos during the Arkansas game, then we can calculate how much money we made from those sales as follows: Number of polos sold = 172 Price per polo = $78 Total amount earned = Number of polos sold x Price per polo = $13,040 (rounded) Therefore, we earned $13,040 from selling 172 polos during the Arkansas game.;
Response:  The total number of polos sold is given as $183 + 31 = 214. Since each polo costs $62, the total revenue from selling polos is $62 x 214 = $13,058. Therefore, the amount that Arkansas Razorbacks earned from selling polos at the Texas Tech game is $13,058.;
Response:  The cost of one polo is $67 and that of one mezzanine is $165. So, if they sold 74 polos and 156 mezzanines, then their total revenue would be:  Total Revenue = Number of Polos x Cost per Polo + Number of Mezzanines x Cost per Mezzanine  Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165  Total Revenue = $49,802 + $25,390  Total Revenue = $75,192  Therefore, they collected $75,192 from selling those tickets.;
Response:  We know that each polo shirt costs $19 and each T-shirt costs $34. So, if we buy one polo shirt, it will cost us $19. Now, let's calculate how much one polo shirt costs per polo shirt. To do this, we need to divide the total amount spent on all polo shirts (157) by the number of polo shirts sold (157). This gives us an average price of $19 / 157 = $0.126 per polo shirt. Therefore, one polo shirt costs approximately $0.126 per unit.;
Response:  We know that each póló brings $86 and each ing brings $232. So if we have x polos sold, then total revenue from polos is 86x. Similarly, if we have y ings sold, then total revenue from ings is 232y. Now, we are told that there were 254 polos and 43 disks sold in total. Therefore, we can write the equation: 86x + 232y = 254 (polos) + 43 (disks). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 109 and y = 176. So, one póló costs approximately $0.83 per unit, and one ing costs approximately $1.76 per unit.;
Response:  The price of each polo shirt is $51. In total, they sold 130 polos at an 8-dollar discount and 8 dollars = $64. So, they earned $64 x 130 = $7920 from selling polos.;
Response:  The total amount of money that was spent on polo shirts at the game is given as $201 x 14 = $2840. So, if they sold 14 polos for $217 each, then they made $217 x 14 = $3068 in revenue from selling polos alone. Therefore, the profit from selling polos is $3068 - $2840 = $228.;
Response:  If they sold $60 worth of polo shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, and they want to make $10 profit per shirt, then we can calculate how many shirts were sold as follows:  Number of shirts = Total revenue / Profit per shirt  In this case, total revenue is $60, and profit per shirt is $10. So, number of shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 shirts. Therefore, they sold 6 polo shirts during the game.;
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling 5 polo shirts is $215. To find out how much each polo shirt costs, we can divide this amount by 5: $$ = \frac {215}{5} = 43$$ So, each polo shirt costs $43.;
Response:  The Razorback bolt won $5 for every inning and $215 for every poll. In this game, they won 20 polls and lost 64 disks. So their total winnings are:  Winnings = Number of polls x Prize money per pole + Number of disks x Prize money per disk  Winnings = 20 x $5 + 64 x $215  Winnings = $1,020 + $13,760  Winnings = $14,780 Therefore, they earned $14,780 from selling polls and disks combined.;
Response:  The Razorbacks earned $76 per ticket and sold 158 tickets for the game against Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, they earned $11,936 in revenue from ticket sales ($76 x 158 = $11,936). However, since some of these tickets were likely given away as free promotional items or used to generate additional revenue through sponsorships or other means, let's assume that only 80% of the revenue was actually generated from ticket sales (this is just an estimate, as we don't have access to the actual figures). So, if we multiply the total revenue by 0.8, we get $9,192 ($11,936 x 0.8 = $9,192). This is how much money the Razorbacks earned from selling tickets to the game.;
Response:  We know that each razorback game brings in $210 from every ticket and $240 from every polo. So, if they sold 177 polos at the Arkansas-Texas Tech game, they brought in $210 x 177 = $36,970 from polos alone. If they also sold 23 disks at this game, they brought in an additional $240 x 23 = $5,480 from disks. Therefore, the total amount of money brought in from both polos and disks at this one game is $36,970 + $5,480 = $42,450.;
"Response:  We know that $115 is the total amount of money earned from all tickets sold for the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Since there were 113 polos and 78 meshes sold during this event, we can calculate the average price per item as follows:
Average Price = Total Amount / Number of Items
= $115 / (113 + 78)
= $115 / 191
= $0.60 per item
Therefore, one polo costs approximately $0.60 per unit compared to its original value of $25.";
Response:  If they have 5 tables and each table has 10 chairs, then there are 5 x 10 = 50 chairs in total. So, there is still 1 chair left over after counting all the chairs at the backyard party.;
Response:  We know that there are two tables with seats in the backyard. Each table has an equal number of chairs. So, if we have x chairs in total, then each table must have x/2 chairs. Since there are two tables, together they have 2x chairs. Therefore, the answer is 2x.;
Response:  We know that there are 9 seats in total and each table has 3 chairs. So, we can write an equation: Number of tables = Total number of seats / Number of chairs per table. In this case, we have: Number of tables = 9 / 3 = 3 tables. Therefore, there are 3 tables in the backyard.;
Response:  If there are 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. Since they decided to hold the party in the backyard, which means that all the chairs will be placed in the backyard. Therefore, the answer is 133 chairs.;
Response:  If there are ten tables and six chairs at each table, then the total number of chairs is 6 x 10 = 60.  Since there are already 11 people sitting at the tables, that means 60 - 11 = 49 chairs will be left unoccupied.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Since there are also 6 extra seats, the total number of seats for the guests is 168 + 6 = 174 seats. Therefore, there are 174 seats available for the guests to sit in during the party.;
Response:  Since there are 4 tables and each table has 3 chairs, we have: Total number of chairs = 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Now, if 14 people attend the party, we need additional chairs to accommodate them, so the total number of chairs needed is: Total number of chairs = 12 + (14 - 4) = 12 + 10 = 22 chairs. Therefore, they will need 22 extra chairs for the party.;
Response:  If there are 9 tables with 14 chairs each, then the total number of chairs is: 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. So, there are 126 - 9 = 117 chairs left.;
"Response:  If Haley works for 5 weeks and she earns $460 per week, then in total she will make... See Explanation

Answer: $2300

Explanation: To calculate how much money Haley can make in 5 weeks, we need to multiply her weekly salary by the number of weeks she works. So, if she makes $460 per week, then in 5 weeks she will make:

$460 x 5 = $2300

Therefore, Haley can make a total of $2300 in 5 weeks working at $460 per week.";
"Response:  If Lewis gets $1216 for his work and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to earn that amount as follows:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, Lewis worked for 78 weeks to earn $1216.";
"Response: 
Lewis gets $21 per week for working 216 hours. So his total earnings are:
$$ Total Earnings = \frac{Weekly Wage}{Hours Worked} \times Number of Weeks $$
= $\$21 \div 216$ $\times 52$
= $\$4320$
Now, he has to pay taxes of $\$702$. So, his remaining amount after paying taxes is:
$$ Remaining Amount = Total Earnings - Taxes $$
= $\$4320 - \$702$
= $\$3618$
Therefore, Lewis will have $\$3618$ left after paying taxes.";
"Response: 
Ha Lewis will work for 73 years at $1357 per week, so he will earn in total:
$$ \text {Total amount earned} = \text {Weekly income} \times \text{Number of weeks worked} $$
$$ \text {Total amount earned} = 1357 \times 73 = 96,803 $$
So, Ha Lewis will earn $96,803 over his 73-year working period.";
"Response: 
Lewis wants to earn $28 per week for 1091 weeks (or 25 years). So he needs to earn a total of $28 x 1091 = $296,300 over those 25 years. 
However, since he also gets $939 per week as compensation for overtime work, his total income over these 25 years would be $296,300 + ($939/week x 1091 weeks) = $473,375.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis gets $403 per week for his job. Secondly, he has to pay $49 as rent every week. So, his total income minus expenses is: $403 - $49 = $354 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $354 per week.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis gets $368 per week and he has to pay $388 as rent every week. Now, let's calculate how much money he pays in total for each month. If he works for 1359 weeks, then his total rent paid will be: Total Rent = Number of Weeks x Weekly Rent x (1 + Percentage increase) Where percentage increase is given by: Percentage Increase = New Amount - Old Amount / Old Amount = $388 - $368 / $368 = 0.274 or 27.4% So, Lewis pays $27.4 more in rent every week than he used to pay earlier.;
"Response: 
Lewis has $491 left after paying $216 for rent every month. So he has $491 - $216 = $275 left. 
After 1181 months (or 99 years), he will have spent a total of $275 x 1181 = $306,375.";
Response:  If Lewis works for 19 hours per day and earns $133 per hour, then he will make $2500 in one day (19 x $133 = $2500). So, if he works every day, he will make $17500 per week ($2500 x 7 days = $17500).;
"Response:  If Lewis gets $2 per day for his work and he wants to earn $178 in total, then we can calculate how many days it will take him as follows:

$2/day x 178/total amount = number of days

So, the number of days it will take Lewis to earn $178 is:

number of days = $2/day x 178/total amount = 89 days

Therefore, Lewis will need to work for 89 days to earn $178.";
"Response:  If Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than his height, then...

Step 1: Calculate the depth of the water in feet.
Depth = 10 x (Dean's height) = 10 x (9) = 90 feet

So, the water is 90 feet deep at that location.";
"Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters below the surface of the water. Since Ron is 14 feet (which is equal to 4.3 meters) deep in the water, we can set up the following equation:

Dean's height = Ron's depth - 2 meters
Ron's depth = 4.3 meters + 2 meters
Ron's depth = 6.3 meters
Therefore, the depth of the water was 6.3 meters.";
"Response:  We know that Ron is 5 times taller than Dean and Dean is 3 meters below Ron. So, if Ron is at a depth of 12 feet (which is equal to 4 meters), then Dean must be at a depth of:

Dean = Ron - 3 meters
= 5 x Ron - 3 meters
= 5 x (5 x 4) - 3 meters
= 20 meters

So, the water was 20 meters deep where Ron was standing.";
Response:  We know that after they decided to swim (pihenés), their height difference is 15 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean is 1 meter tall, then Ron must be 15 meters tall. Since Ron is 1 meter shorter than Dean, we can say that Ron is 14 meters tall. Now, since the water is 15 times deeper than Dean's height, and Dean is 1 meter tall, the depth of the water is 15 x 1 = 15 meters deep. Therefore, Ron is 14 + 15 = 29 meters deep in the water.;
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 feet (1.52 m) tall and Dean is 3 meters (9.84 ft) taller than him, which means he is 3 + 1.52 = 4.52 meters (14.76 ft) tall. The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, so it is 16 x 1.52 = 23.12 meters (75.85 ft) deep. Since Dean is 3 meters taller than Ron, we can subtract 1.52 from both sides of the equation to get the depth of the water relative to Ron: 23.12 - 1.52 = 21.60 meters (67.98 ft). So the water was 21.60 meters deep.;
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 11 times greater than Dean's height at the point where they decided to swim. So if Dean is 6 feet tall (72 inches), then the depth of the water is 11 x 72 = 792 inches. Since Ron is 15 feet tall (180 inches), we can calculate his distance from the surface as follows: Distance = Depth + Height = 792 + 180 = 972 inches.;
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among two rooms, then each room will have 34/2 = 17 books.;
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf can hold 2 books, then there are 42/2 = 21 shelves. So, there are 21 shelves in total.;
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and he viewed them all, then he must have put back at least some of them in the bookshelf. So, let's assume that out of his total of 27 books, only x number are currently on the shelf (where x is a positive integer). Then, we know that the total number of books Brian has = 27 - x. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines, then the total number of magazines he has = 80. Now, we need to find out how many magazines are currently on the shelf given that there are already 23 books on it. To do this, we can divide the total number of magazines by the number of magazines that can fit on each shelf (i.e., 23). This gives us the number of magazines currently on the shelf = 80 / 23 = 3.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a magazine, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 magazines. Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of books Brian has = 27 - x Total number of magazines Brian has = 4;
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up 2 shelves (since there are 10 shelves in total), then he has 9 x 2 = 18 books on his bookshelf.  Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up 3 shelves, then he has 46 x 3 = 138 magazines on his bookshelf. Therefore, Brian has a total of 18 + 138 = 156 publications on his bookshelf.;
Response:  We know that Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines. If he has all of them in his bookshelf, then we can say that each shelf contains an average number of books (let's call it x) and magazines (let's call it y). Since there are 29 shelves in total, we can write the following equation:  Number of books = Total number of books / Number of shelves = 23 / 29 = 0.79  Similarly, for magazines, we have:  Number of magazines = Total number of magazines / Number of shelves = 61 / 29 = 0.68  Now, let's calculate the total number of books and magazines Brian has:  Total number of books = Number of books per shelf x Number of shelves = 0.79 x 29 = 22.55 books Total number of magazines = Number of magazines per shelf x Number of shelves = 0.68 x 29 = 18.42 magazines Therefore, Brian has approximately 22.55 books and 18.42 magazines in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 bookshelves and each shelf has an equal number of books. So, if we divide the total number of books (28) by the number of shelves (7), we get the average number of books per shelf: $\boxed{3}$. Therefore, there are $3$ books in each shelf.;
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf has 2 books, then...
1. The number of bookshelves = 38 / 2 = 19
So, Brian has 19 bookshelves.";
Response:  If there are 10 friends and each invitation requires 2 invitations (one for the host and one for the guest), then we need to divide 10 by 2 to find out how many sets of invitations we need:  $10 \div 2 = 5$ sets of invitations. Therefore, Carol needs to send at least $5$ packages to make sure that none of her $10$ friends get left out.;
Response:  We know that Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her party and she bought 3 packages of invitations. Since each package contains an equal number of invitations (as stated in the problem), we can conclude that there are 3 x 12 = 36 invitations in total. Therefore, there is one invitation in every 36 invitations.;
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each package contained 10 invitations, then she must have received 7 packages in total (since she bought only 7). Therefore, there are 7 x 10 = 70 invitations in total. Since Carol is sending two invitations to her friends, that means there are 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over. So, the answer is 68.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party and each package contained 14 invitations, then she must have taken 6 packages or 84 invitations in total (since there are 14 invitations per package). Therefore, if she took 11 invitations from the packages, that means she has 73 unused invitations left (84 - 11 = 73). So, Carol can invite up to 73 of her friends to her birthday party.;
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 9 friends and each package contains 3 invitations, then she needs to buy 9 x 3 = 27 packages of invitations. So, Carol needs to buy 2 more packages of invitations (2 + 1 = 3). Therefore, the answer is 3.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played 3 games, then she scored a total of 36 points (12 x 3 = 36). So, she played 3 games.;
Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored 81 points in total, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).;
Response:  We know that Melissa has scored 109 points in total and received 82 bonus points. So her total score is 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now we need to find out how many points she scored in 79 matches. To do this, we can divide her total score by the number of matches she played: 191 / 79 = 2.43 points per match. Therefore, Melissa scored 2.43 x 79 = 186.57 points in 79 matches.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points every game, then we can write an equation as follows: Total points = Number of games x Points per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total points = 21 / Number of games x Points per game = 21 / n x 7 = n x 7 Where n is the number of games played by Melissa. Now, we are asked to find out how many games Melissa played. Therefore, we need to solve for n. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: n = Total points / 7 = 21 / 7 = 3 So, Melissa played 3 games.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in 13 games, then she must have scored an average of $91/13 = 7$ points per game. Therefore, she scored $7 \times 13 = 91$ points in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 seating places in the Ferris wheel and we want to find out how many people can sit on one seat. So let's divide 20 by 4.  Therefore, each seat can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5).;
Response:  If there are n seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 9n. Since 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once, we have the equation: 9n = 18. Solving for n, we get: n = 2. Therefore, there are 2 seats in the Ferris wheel.;
Response:  We have 19 seats in each of the 3 cars. Each seat can accommodate 15 people, so we have a total capacity of 19 x 15 = 285 people per car. To find out how many people can ride all three cars at once, we need to divide the total capacity of all three cars by 3: 285 / 3 = 95 people. Therefore, 95 people can ride all three cars at once.;
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

18 x 15 = 270 people

If 10 seats become available after some break down, then the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once will be:

270 - 10 = 260 people";
Response:  If there are already 6 people sitting in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total number of people who have already sat in the wheel is:  6 x 14 = 84.  Now, if 16 more people want to join, the new total number will be:  84 + 16 = 100. So, 100 people can still join the Ferris wheel.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the park. If we divide the number of large seats by the capacity of each seat (54), we get: Number of people who can sit on large seats = 23 / 54 = 0.42 or approximately 42 people. Since there are 2 small seats, we need to multiply the number of people who can sit on large seats by 2 to find out how many people can fit in total: Total number of people who can fit in the park = 42 x 2 = 84 people. Therefore, 84 people can fit in the park.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the Ferris wheel. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, so we have 3 x 16 = 48 people who can sit in the small seats. Now, each large seat can accommodate 12 people, so we have 7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit in the large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can sit in the Ferris wheel is 48 + 84 = 132 people.;
Response:  If there are 16 people who want to ride bikes together in Paradise Park with big wheels and each bike has 4 seats, then we need to calculate how many people can fit on each seat. To do this, we divide the total number of people (16) by the number of seats per bike (4). So, the answer is: $ \boxed{4} $ people can fit on each seat.;
Response:  If four people can fit in the wheelchair in paradise, and it can accommodate two people at a time, then there are 2 places available in the wheelchair for each person. Therefore, the number of places in the wheelchair is 8.;
Response:  If we ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices (which is assumed in the problem), then the total number of slices from all 7 pizzas would be 7 x 14 = 98 slices. So there are 98 slices in each pizza.;
Response:  If there are 28 slices in total and each pizza has two slices, then we can calculate how many pizzas were ordered as follows: Number of pizzas = Total number of slices / Number of slices per pizza So, if we have 28 slices in total and each slice is from two pizzas, then we can write an equation like this: Number of pizzas = 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas Therefore, we ordered 14 pizzas.;
"Response:  If we have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is:

17 x 4 = 68

So there are 68 slices of pizza in total.";
Response:  If we order 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two people, they will get an equal amount of slices, so each person will get 45 slices (90/2).;
"Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each flowerbed, then... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each flowerbed, then the total number of seeds is:

10 x 45 = 450 seeds

So, Paige and her mother planted 450 seeds together.";
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and they together planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds, then we can assume that each flower bed contains an equal number of seeds. So, if there are x seed beds, then each seed bed contains x/9 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds planted is 45x/9 = 5 seeds per seed bed.;
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds in total. Since each seed pot contains 12 seeds, we can write an equation as follows: Number of flower pots = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per pot  In this case, we have: Number of flower pots = 36 / 12 = 3 So, there were 3 flower pots in total.;
"Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and they together planted 55 seeds in each flower bed, then the total number of seeds planted is:

55 x 3 = 165 seeds

Since only 60 seedlings grew for every 15 seeds sown, the number of seedlings grown is:

165 / 15 = 11 seedlings per flower bed

Therefore, the number of seedlings that were grown is 11.";
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each flower bed, then...  We know that there are 60 total seeds (10 x 6 = 60). So, if they put 10 seeds in each flower bed, then...  They will have 6 flower beds!;
Response:  If Paige helped her mother to plant 8 flower beds with flowers and each flower bed contains an equal number of seeds, then we can say that...  Therefore, if there are 32 seeds in total, then each seed will be divided equally among the 8 flower beds, resulting in...;
Response:  If Matthew had one small cookie and gave two cookies to each of his three friends, then he would have given away 6 cookies in total (3 friends x 2 cookies per friend = 6 cookies). So, there were originally 6 cookies, including the one that Matthew had for himself. Therefore, Matthew had 5 cookies left over (6 - 1 = 5).;
Response:  If Matthew had 8 cakes to share among his friends and he gave two cakes to each of them, then the number of cakes he gave to each friend is 2. So, in total, Matthew gave 2 x 5 = 10 cakes to his friends.;
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his five friends an equal number of cookies (keksz), then he must have given them 3 cookies each (since there are 5 friends and 3 x 5 = 15 cookies were given out). So, if Matthew gave 3 cookies to each friend, then the total number of cookies that they received is 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. Therefore, there are still 10 cookies left over after they ate their share.;
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of cookies to his three friends and still has 17 cookies left, then he must have given each friend an odd number of cookies (since dividing 17 by 3 gives you an integer). So let x be the number of cookies Matthew gave to each friend. Since Matthew had 17 cookies left after giving them out, we know that 3x = 17. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his three friends 5 cookies.;
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of cookies and cakes to his 11 friends, then each friend received $ \frac{22}{11} = 2$ cookies and $\frac{34}{11} = 3$ cakes. So, in total, $2 \times 11 = 22$ cookies were eaten by all the friends together, and $3 \times 11 = 33$ cakes were eaten.;
"Response:  If Matthew gave 29 cookies and 30 sweets to his two friends, then each friend got an equal number of both cookies and sweets. Therefore, if one friend received x cookies and y sweets, then the other friend also received x cookies and y sweets. Since there are 29 cookies in total, we can write the equation:
x + y = 29... (1) Similarly, since there are 30 sweets in total, we can write the equation:
x + y = 30... (2) Now, we need to find the value of x and y that satisfies both equations (1) and (2). We can solve this system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 14 y = 16 Substituting these values into equations (1) and (2), we get:
14 + 16 = 29 14 + 16 = 30 Which gives us:
50 = 29 50 = 30 Therefore, each friend got 14 cookies and 16 sweets.";
"Response:  We know that Matthew gave each of his seven friends an equal number of cookies and pies. So if he gave x cookies to one friend, then he gave x/7 cookies to all of his other six friends combined (since there are 6 friends in total). Similarly, if he gave y pies to one friend, then he gave y/7 pies to all of his other five friends combined. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the information given in the problem:
x + (y/7) = 14 ( since Matthew gave 14 keksze and 21 torta together )
x/7 + (y/7) = 21 ( since Matthew gave 14 keksze and 21 torta together )
Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. To do this, we can add equation (1) to itself three times:
3(x + (y/7)) = 3(14) = 42
3(x/7 + (y/7)) = 3(21) = 63
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 9
y = 10
Therefore, Matthew gave 9 cookies and 10 pies to each of his seven friends.";
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of cookies to each of his 18 friends, then he gave a total of 18 x 3 = 54 cookies. Since there were originally 36 cookies, we can deduce that Matthew had 36 - 54 = 20 cookies left after giving them all away.;
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 36 friends one keksza, then he gave away a total of 36 kekszes. So, if he had given everyone he was friendly with a keksza, there would be no kekszes left for him to give to anyone else. Therefore, the number of people he was friendly with is equal to the number of kekszes he gave away, which is 36.;
Response:  We know that Matthew had 23 cookies and gave away 11 of them to his two friends. So, the number of cookies given to each friend is: Number of cookies given to each friend = Total number of cookies given away / Number of friends  Number of cookies given to each friend = 11 / 2 = 5.5 cookies per friend. Therefore, Matthew's two friends ate 5.5 cookies each.;
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 kekszes initially and gave away 5 of them to his friends. So, he has 31 - 5 = 26 kekszes left.;
"Response:  We know that Matthew gave an equal number of cookies and cakes to his four friends. If there were initially 32 cookies and 98 cakes, then the number of cookies each friend received is also equal. So, if x is the number of cookies each friend received, we can write:
x = (initial number of cookies) / (number of friends) = (32) / 4 = 8
Therefore, each friend received 8 cookies.";
Response:  We know that Matthew gave an equal number of croissants and pastries to his four friends. If there were initially 10 croissants and 8 pastries, then after Matthew gave them out, there would be 5 croissants and 4 pastries left over (since each friend got 2 of each). So, in total, 3 + 4 = 7 friends ate something (either croissants or pastries). Therefore, 7 friends ate something.;
"Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 28 friends an equal number of both cookies and cakes, then he must have given:

* 13 cookies to 28 friends = 346 cookies (since there are 13 cookies in total)
* 15 cakes to 28 friends = 405 cakes (since there are 15 cakes in total)

So, altogether, Matthew gave out 751 treats (346 cookies + 405 cakes).";
"Response:  If Debbie drank 109 glasses of water per day and the bottles lasted for 74 days, then she would have drunk in total:

$$ \text {Number of glasses} = \text{Total number of days} \times \text{Number of glasses per day} $$

So, we can calculate the total number of glasses as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of glasses} &= 74 \times 109 \\ &= 8263 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, Debbie drank $8263$ glasses of water during the entire period of $74$ days.";
"Response:  If Debbie took 153 bottles of water during an auction and drank the same number every day for 17 days, then she would have drunk:

$$ Number = \text{153} \times \text{17} = 2595 $$
So, Debbie drank $2595$ bottles of water during those 17 days.";
"Response:  If Debbie took 264 glasses of water during an auction and she drank 15 glasses per day for 11 days, then we can calculate how many glasses she had left as follows:

Day 1: 264 - 15 = 249 glasses
Day 2: 249 - 15 = 234 glasses
...
Day 11: 234 - 15 = 219 glasses
Therefore, Debbie had 219 glasses of water left after the auction.";
"Response:  We know that Debbie took 301 glasses of water during an auction. If she drank 144 glasses per day for several days, then we can calculate how many days it lasted as follows:

Days = Total amount of water taken / Amount drunk per day
= 301 / 144
= 2.09 days
Therefore, Debbie drank 2.09 days worth of water during those few days.";
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of sparkling water. If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of sparkling water per day, we can calculate how many days it will last her as follows:

Days = Number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 88 / 4
= 22 days
Therefore, the water bottles will last Debbie for 22 days.";
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of juice at an auction. If she drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of juice per day, then we can calculate how many days it would last her as follows:

Days = (Total amount of drink consumed) / (Amount of drink consumed per day)
= (200 + 256) / 312
= 56 / 312
= 18 days
Therefore, Debbie's supply of drinks will last for 18 days.";
Response:  If Debbie takes 12 glasses of water in total, and each glass contains 0.5 liters (L), then she has taken a total of 6 L of water (12 x 0.5 L). Since we know that humans can survive without water for several days, let's assume that Debbie can go without water for at least 3 days (since 6 L / 0.5 L per glass = 3 days). Therefore, Debbie could potentially last without water for at least 3 days after taking 12 glasses of water.;
"Response:  We know that Debbie took 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of juice to the auction. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of juice per day, we can calculate how many days it will last her using simple arithmetic.  So, let's do the calculation:

Days = (Number of bottles taken to the auction) / (Number of bottles consumed per day)
= (95 + 180) / (15 + 54)
= 275 / 69
= 3.9 years
Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Debbie's supply of water and juice will last for approximately 3.9 years.";
Response:  We know that Debbie took 360 glasses of water and 162 glasses of juice to an auction. If she drank 122 glasses of water and 9 glasses of juice per day, how many days will it last her?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of drinks taken by the daily consumption. So,  Total drinks = 360 + 162 = 522 Drinks per day = 122 + 9 = 131 Drinks / Days = 522 / 131 = 4 days Therefore, Debbie will have enough drinks for 4 days.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 14 sorrows and each sorrow has 11 ceremonial candles. So, we need to find out how many ceremonial candles Faye has in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of sorrows (14) by the number of ceremonial candles per sorrow (11). Therefore, Faye has 14 x 11 = 154 ceremonial candles in total.;
"Response:  We know that there are 12 ceruzzati in total and they are placed equally among 3 rows. So, we can calculate the number of ceruzzati each row has as follows: Row 1: 12 / 3 = 4 ceruzzati; Row 2: 12 / 3 = 4 ceruzzati; Row 3: 12 / 3 = 4 ceruzzati. Therefore, there are 4 ceruzzati in each row.";
Response:  We know that Faye had 16 ceruzák and she wanted to sort them into boxes of 24 each. So, we need to divide 16 by 24 to find out how many boxes Faye could make. 16 / 24 = 6. Therefore, Faye could make 6 boxes of ceruzák.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 22 ceruzák and each box contains 14 ceruzák. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of ceruzák as follows: Total Number of Ceruzák = Number of Boxes x Number of Ceruzák in Each Box Total Number of Ceruzák = 6 boxes x 14 ceruzák/box Total Number of Ceruzák = 84 ceruzák So, Faye has 84 ceruzák.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 ceramic stamps and 7 ink pads. To calculate how many rows she can make, we need to divide the number of ceramic stamps by the number of ink pads. So, we have: Number of rows = Number of ceramic stamps / Number of ink pads = 35 / 7 = 5 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 5 rows of stamping with her current supplies.;
Response:  We know that Faye has rendered 19 sorras of the crossword puzzle and each row contains either 4 or 5 crosses. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of crosses as follows: Total number of crosses = Number of rows x Number of crosses in each row Total number of crosses = 19 x (4 + 5) / 2 Total number of crosses = 19 x 9 / 2 = 136 ceruzák. So, Faye has 136 ceruzák.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 sorras rendered and each row contains either 36 or 30 ceramic tiles. So, we need to find out how many ceramic tiles Faye has in total.  To do this, let's count the number of rows with 36 ceramic tiles and multiply it by 36. Then, add the number of rows with 30 ceramic tiles and multiply it by 30. Finally, subtract the result from the total number of ceramic tiles used.  Therefore, the answer is:  Total number of ceramic tiles = (Number of rows with 36 ceramic tiles x Number of ceramic tiles per row) + (Number of rows with 30 ceramic tiles x Number of ceramic tiles per row) - Total number of ceramic tiles used.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 11 sorras of candles and each row contains 31 candles. So, in total, she has 31 x 11 = 341 candles. Similarly, we know that she also has 27 candles in each row, so she has 27 x 11 = 307 candles in total. Therefore, the total number of candles Faye has is 341 + 307 = 648 candles.;
"Response:  If Faye has 30 ceruzák and she wants to put them in rows of 5 each, then we need to divide 30 by 5. So, the number of rows that Faye can make with her 30 ceruzák is:

$$ \boxed{6} $$

Therefore, Faye can make 6 rows of 5 ceruzák each using all of her 30 ceruzák.";
"Response:  If there were 6 ceramic pens in total and Faye placed 2 of them in each row, then...

Answer: There are 2 rows, so the number of ceramic pens in each row is 2/2 = 1. Therefore, the total number of ceramic pens is 6 / 2 = 3. So, Faye placed 3 ceramic pens in each row.";
Response:  If Faye had 35 boxes of pencils and each box contained 4 pencils, then she would have 35 x 4 = 140 pencils in total. Since she could sort them into two rows, we can say that she has 140 / 2 = 70 pencils in each row. So, there are 70 pencils in each row.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 boxes of pencils and each box contains 6 pencils. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are told that 19 pencils were arranged in a row. Therefore, the number of pencils left after arranging them in a row is 186 - 19 = 167 pencils. So, to answer your question, Faye has 167 pencils.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 sorras rendered and each row contains either 71 or 24 ceramic tiles. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of ceramic tiles = Number of rows with 71 ceramic tiles + Number of rows with 24 ceramic tiles.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of ceramic tiles = 30 (rows) x (71 ceramic tiles/row) + 30 (rows) x (24 ceramic tiles/row). Simplifying the expression, we get: Total number of ceramic tiles = 30 x 71 + 30 x 24 = 2160 + 720 = 2880 ceramic tiles. Therefore, Faye has 2880 ceramic tiles.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 16 sorras rendered and each row contains either 6 or 21 ceramic tiles. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of ceramic tiles = Total number of rows x Number of ceramic tiles per row  In this case, the total number of rows is 16, and the number of ceramic tiles per row is either 6 or 21. Therefore, we can substitute these values in the equation as follows:  Number of ceramic tiles = 16 x (6 + 21)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of ceramic tiles = 47  Therefore, Faye has 47 ceramic tiles in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and 98 students in total. Since each class has an equal number of students (since they all fit into 7 buses), we can assume that each bus carries 98/21 = 4.5 students on average. Therefore, there are 7 buses x 4.5 students per bus = 31 students who go on the field trip. So, there are 31 seats available on each bus for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and 95 school buses with 118 seating capacity each. So, we need to find out how many students can fit into one bus. To do this, we divide the total number of seats (118) by the number of passengers per bus (95). This gives us an average of 1.23 students per bus. Now, since there are 95 school buses, we multiply the average number of students per bus by the number of buses to get the total number of students who can go on the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 106 students (95 x 1.23 = 106).;
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in the school and each class has 66 students. So, we have to divide the total number of students (66 x 67 = 4052) by the number of seats available per bus (6). Therefore, we need 683 buses for the field trip (4052 / 6 = 683).;
Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in the school and each class has an equal number of students (58). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of classes to find out how many students will be in each bus.  Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 87 x 58 = 4960 students. Since two buses are needed for the trip, we require 2 x 4960 = 9920 seats in the buses. So, we need 9920/100 = 99 buses to accommodate all the students.;
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in the school and each class has an equal number of students (120). Therefore, we can assume that there are 120/24 = 5 students per class. Since there are 84 seats available on each bus, we can divide this number among the 24 classes to find out how many students will be able to go on the field trip. So, 84 / 24 = 3.5 students per class will be able to go on the field trip.  Therefore, there are 5 x 3.5 = 17.5 students who will be able to go on the field trip from each class.;
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and they will be divided into groups of 8 students per bus. If 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, then we need to find out how many groups can fit on each bus. Therefore, we divide 102 by 8 = 13. So, we need 13 buses for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 102 classes in the school and 11 students in total. Since 99 seats are available on each bus, we can assume that all 11 students will go on the field trip. Therefore, none of them will not go. So, all 11 students will go on the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students. So, we have:  Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 72 x 3 = 216 students. Since they need to travel together, we divide the total number of students by the number of buses available: Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 216 / 3 = 72 buses. Therefore, they will need 72 buses for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 classes in the school and each class has an average of 30 students (which means some classes may have more or fewer students). So, we can assume that the total number of students in all classes is approximately equal to 17 x 30 = 510 students. Since there are 46 school buses, we can calculate the number of seats available per bus as follows: Number of seats = Total number of students / Number of buses = 510 students / 46 buses = 11 seats per bus Now, let's assume that every bus is fully loaded with passengers, meaning that every seat is occupied. In this case, the total number of passengers who will go on the field trip would be 92 students (the total number of students in the school) divided by 11 seats per bus = 8 students per bus. Therefore, if every bus is fully loaded, 8 students per bus x 46 buses = 352 students will go on the field trip.;
Response:  If there are 11 boys in Haley's class and they all want to play golf, then the total number of boys who want to play golf is 11.  If Haley gives each boy 9 golf balls, then the total number of golf balls given out is 11 x 9 = 99 golf balls. So, Haley had 99 golf balls.;
Response:  If there are n boys in Haley's class and each boy gets 5 balls from Haley, then the total number of balls given out is 5n. Since Haley has 10 balls to give away, we can set up the equation: 5n = 10. Solving for n gives us n = 2. So, Haley gave 5 balls to 2 boys.;
Response:  If there are 4 boys in total and they have 23 golf balls among them, then each boy has an average of 5.75 golf balls (23/4).  Now, if Haley wants to keep 15 golf balls for herself, she will take away 15 from the total number of golf balls that the boys had, which is 5.75 x 4 = 23. So, the boys will be left with 0 golf balls.;
Response:  If there are 13 boys who want to play golf and 50 boys who want to play cards, then the total number of boys is 13 + 50 = 63.  Since Haley has 26 balls, each boy will get 26 / 63 = 4 balls.;
Response:  If Haley has 20 balls and he wants to share them equally among the boys in the second grade, then each boy will get 20/x balls, where x is the number of boys. Since there are 5 boys in total, we can find out how many balls each boy gets by dividing 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4 So each boy gets 4 balls from Haley.;
Response:  If there are n boys in Haley's class and each boy gets 2 balls, then the total number of balls given out is 2n. Since Haley had 28 balls to begin with, we can set up the equation: 2n = 28. Solving for n, we get: n = 14. So, Haley gave one ball to 14 boys.;
Response:  The book had 392 pages and Frank read 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he read per day:  Number of days = Total pages / Daily pages = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, it took Frank 27 days to finish reading his favorite book.;
Response:  We know that Frank read the book every day for 569 days and he read 22 pages per day. So, in total, he read $ = 569 \times 22 = 12380$ pages of the book. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is $ = 12380 / 569 = 21$.;
Response:  The book had 612 pages and Frank took 6 days to finish it (6 x 8 = 48). So he read 48 pages per day.;
Response:  We know that there are 555 pages in total and it took Frank 220 days to finish reading the book. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages, we can assume that each chapter has 555/5 = 111 pages. Therefore, each chapter contains 111 pages.;
"Response:  We know that Frank read 193 pages of his favorite book and there are 15 chapters in total. Since he finished reading the book after 660 days, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows:

Days = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter / Total Days taken to finish the book

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Days = 15 x 193 / 660 = 27.8 days

So, Frank read one chapter every 27.8 days.";
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to finish reading all the books (3 x 249 = 747 pages), and each book had 249 pages, then he read 747/3 = 249 pages per day.;
"Response:  If it took Frank 12 days to read all 66 pages of each book (which is a total of 784 pages), and he has 492 days to finish reading all books, then we can calculate how many books he reads in that time as follows:

Number of books = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read them
= 784 pages/days x 492 days
= 350 books
Therefore, Frank reads 350 books in 492 days.";
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 16 days and completed it in 112 pages. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the number of pages by the number of days he spent reading: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days spent reading = 112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days.;
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, it will take him:

576 / 8 = 72 days to finish reading the book.";
"Response:  We know that there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is:

41 x 450 = 18,100 pages

Now we know that it took Frank 30 days to read the entire book, so he read at most:

18,100 pages / 30 days = 603 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read approximately 603 pages per day.";
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages / Number of chapters. In this case, we have: Number of pages = 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter. Therefore, each chapter contains 198 pages.;
Response:  We know that Frank read two chapters of his favorite book, and each chapter contains 405 pages. Therefore, he read a total of 810 pages in those two chapters (2 x 405 = 810). Now we need to find out how many days it took him to finish reading these 810 pages. According to the question, it took Frank 664 days to finish reading the entire book. So, if he read 810 pages in just two chapters, then he must have read approximately 10.13 pages per day (810 / 664 = 10.13).;
Response:  We know that there are 6 DVDs in one package and it costs $120 for all of them. To find out how much each DVD costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of DVDs: $120 / 6 = $20 per DVD. So, each DVD costs $20.;
"Response:  If each package contains $81 worth of goods and we want to buy 33 DVDs, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many packages of goods are needed to buy 33 DVDs at $81 per package.
$ Number of packages = $ Value of goods in each package x Quantity of goods wanted / Price of goods in each package
= $81 x 33 / $81
= 4.06 packages (round up to nearest whole number)

So, you would need approximately 4 packages of goods to buy 33 DVDs at $81 per package.";
"Response:  If you pay $107 for a package of DVDs and there is a discount of $106 per package, then the cost of each DVD would be:
$107 - $106 = $1
So, if you want to buy 93 DVDs at $1 each, you will have to pay:
$1 x 93 = $93
Therefore, you can buy 93 DVDs for $93.";
Response:  If the price of one package is $76 and there is a discount of $25 for each package, then we need to calculate how much money you would have to pay to buy one package after applying the discount. So, the amount you would have to pay = Price of one package - Discount = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you would have to pay $51 to buy one package.;
"Response:  We know that $104 is the total amount of money available for buying DVDs. So, we can write an equation as follows:

$104 = x \times y

where x represents the number of DVDs that can be bought and y represents the cost of each DVD. Since we are given that $26 is the cost of each DVD, we can substitute this value into our equation:

$104 = x \times $26

Now, we need to solve for x (the number of DVDs that can be bought). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $26:

x = $104 / $26

x = 4

So, if $104 is available for buying DVDs, then 4 DVDs can be purchased with that amount of money.";
Response: 1 DVD costs $20, so 2 DVDs cost $40. If we buy 2 DVDs for $28, that means we are getting a third DVD for free! So, the price of each DVD is $28 / 3 = $9 per DVD.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide them into groups of equal size, then each group will contain half of the total number of bananas, which is 9 (since 18 / 2 = 9). So, there will be 9 groups of bananas.;
"Response:  We know that there are 365 bananas in Philip's collection and we need to divide them into groups of 187 bananas each. So, we can start with the first group of 187 bananas and then continue adding more groups until all the bananas are used up.

Let X be the number of groups we can make with 187 bananas each. Then, we have:
X × 187 = 365 (total number of bananas)
Solving for X, we get:
X = 365 / 187 = 2
So, we can make 2 groups of 187 bananas each using all the 365 bananas in Philip's collection.";
Response:  We know that Philip has 203 bananas and 63 oranges in his collection. If we divide the bananas into 7 groups of 28 each (since there are 7 x 28 = 196 bananas total), then we will have 196 / 7 = 27 banana groups left over. Similarly, if we divide the oranges into 95 groups of 0.66 each (since there are 95 x 0.66 = 61 oranges total), then we will have 61 / 95 = 0.64 orange group left over. So, the final answer is 27 + 0.64 = 27.64.;
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into 47 groups, then each group will contain 3 bananas (since 47 divided by 3 = 15). Now, let's find out how many groups of oranges we can make with 356 oranges. Since 356 divided by 178 = 2, we can make 2 groups of oranges using all 356 oranges. Therefore, the number of orange groups is 2. So, the answer to the question is 2.;
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. So, we need to find out how many total bananas are in all these groups. To do this, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of bananas in each group: Number of bananas = Total number of bananas in all groups x Number of groups = 196 x 392 = 70,488 Therefore, there are 70,488 bananas in Philip's collection.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 different sizes of bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide this number by 3 (since each group must contain at least 3 bananas), we get 6 groups. So, there are 6 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.;
Response:  We know that there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the oranges into 93 groups, then each group will contain: Number of oranges / Total number of oranges = 87/870 = 1/10. So, one group contains 1 orange. Similarly, if we divide the bananas into 2 groups, then each group will contain: Number of bananas / Total number of bananas = 290/580 = 1/2. So, two groups contain 1 banana each. Therefore, the answer is 1 orange per group for the oranges and 1 banana per group for the bananas.;
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into groups of size 345, then each group will contain 345/192 = 1.76 bananas on average. Similarly, if we divide the oranges into groups of size 16, then each group will contain 384/16 = 24 oranges on average. So, the number of orange groups is 24.;
"Response:  If Brenda made 38 sütemények and each one contains 19 sütit, then...

Answer: The number of sütit that Brenda gave to each guest is 38 / 19 = 2. So she gave 2 sütit to each guest.";
"Response:  If Brenda baked 14 people and each person had 30 sweets, then...

Answer: Brenda made 14 x 30 = 420 sweets in total.";
"Response:  If Anya baked 5 people and made 22 scones in total, that means each person got x scones (where x is the number of people). Since 17 scones were left over after everyone had their share, we can set up an equation:
x + 17 = 22
Now solve for x:
x = 22 - 17
x = 5
So there are 5 scones per person.";
Response:  If Brenda baked 10 pieces of cake and only 9 guests came, then she must have given each guest less than one piece of cake (since there are more pieces of cake than guests). Specifically, if each guest got x pieces of cake, we can set up the equation: 10 = 9x. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. So each guest got 1 piece of cake.;
Response:  If there are 14 pieces of candy and two guests eat an equal amount (which we assume is also 14), then each guest will have eaten half of the total number of candies. Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  If Brenda made 10 sutik (sütemények) in total and each guest received 2 sütik (sütemények), then the number of guests she served = Total number of sütik / Number of sütik per guest = 10/2 = 5 guests. Therefore, Brenda served 5 guests with sütik (sütemények).;
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of candy in total and we want to divide them equally between two bags. So, if we divide them evenly, each bag will contain half of the candies, which is 42/2 = 21 candies per bag. Therefore, each bag contains 21 edible sweets.;
"Response:  If Frank had $X$ candy pieces and he divided them equally among $Y$ bags, then each bag contained $\frac{X}{Y}$ candy pieces. Since there were $Z$ bags in total, we can write the equation:
$$\frac{X}{Y} = \frac{X}{Z}$$
Now, we know that $X=33$, so we can solve for $Y$:
$$Y = \frac{33}{Z}$$
So, Frank had $33$ candy pieces and distributed them among $Z=26$ bags, meaning each bag contained $\frac{33}{26} = 1.32$ candy pieces.";
Response:  We know that Frank has given away 33 sweets and lost 24 of them. So, he now has 9 sweets left. If we divide these 9 sweets equally among 5 bags (since there are 5 options), then each bag will contain 1.8 sweets (9/5). Therefore, there will be 5 bags with 1.8 sweets in each.;
Response:  If Frank put 11 corks into each bottle, then he had a total of 11 x 7 = 77 corks.  So, if he added 22 more corks, there would be 77 + 22 = 99 corks in total. Therefore, there are 99 bottles.;
Response:  If Frank has 16 candy pieces and he puts them in two bags, then each bag will contain how many candies?  We can assume that since there are two bags, each bag must have an equal number of candies. So, if Bag A contains x candies, then Bag B also contains x candies.  Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the given condition.  From the problem statement, we know that the total number of candies is 16. Therefore, the sum of the number of candies in both bags must be equal to 16.  Can you take it from here and solve for x?;
Response:  We have to find out how many boxes of three layers are needed to transport 25 boxes of trefoils. Since each box contains 14 layers, we need to divide 25 by 14 to get the number of boxes of three layers that are needed:  Therefore, we need 375 boxes of three layers to transport 25 boxes of trefoils.;
Response:  If Shirley has collected 10 boxes of three-layered packaging, and each box contains 5 packages to be shipped, then we can calculate as follows: Number of packages = Total number of boxes x Number of packages per box = 10 x 5 = 50 packages. Therefore, there are 50 packages that need to be shipped.;
Response:  We know that there were 67 glasses of regular soda and 9 glasses of diet soda. To find out how many more glasses of regular soda were consumed than diet soda, we can divide the number of regular glasses by the number of diet glasses:  Number of regular glasses / Number of diet glasses = 67 / 9 = 7.5  So, 7.5 more glasses of regular soda were consumed than diet soda.;
Response:  We know that there were 22 glasses of regular soda and 61 glasses of diet soda in total. So, if we subtract the number of regular sodas from the total number of glasses, we get:  Number of diet sodas = Total number of glasses - Number of regular sodas  Number of diet sodas = 61 - 22  Number of diet sodas = 39  Therefore, 39 additional diet sodas were consumed beyond the usual amount.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 glasses of regular soda in total. Then, we have 8 glasses of diet soda and 41 apples. So, if we want to find out how many glasses of soda there are altogether, we can simply add up all these numbers: 30 + 8 = 38 glasses of soda altogether. Therefore, there were 38 glasses of soda in the store.;
Response:  We know that there were 79 glasses of soda in total. Of those, 53 were dietetic and 42 were apple juice. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of glasses = Number of dietetic glasses + Number of apple juice glasses  Total number of glasses = 79  Now, let's solve for the number of dietetic glasses:  Number of dietetic glasses = Total number of glasses - Number of apple juice glasses  Number of dietetic glasses = 79 - 42  Number of dietetic glasses = 37  Therefore, 37 more glasses of dietetic soda were consumed than regular soda.;
Response:  We know that there are 54 dietary drinks and 83 regular drinks in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of dietary drinks = Total number of drinks - Number of regular drinks  Number of dietary drinks = 83 + 54 = 137 drinks  Therefore, more than 137 regular drinks were consumed if 54 dietary drinks were found.;
Response:  We know that there were 17 glasses in total and 9 of them were regular soda. So, the number of regular soda glasses = 9. Now, we are told that the remaining 8 glasses were diet soda. Therefore, the number of diet soda glasses = 8. Finally, we are given that there were 29 apples. Since each apple represents one serving, the number of servings = 29. But we already have the number of glasses of diet soda, so we can find out how many servings of regular soda they drank by subtracting the number of diet soda glasses from the total number of glasses: Number of servings of regular soda = Total number of glasses - Number of diet soda glasses = 17 - 8 = 9. So, the people in the store consumed 9 servings of regular soda.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 dietary drinks and 60 regular drinks in total. To find out how many more regular drinks were consumed than dietary drinks, we need to subtract the number of dietary drinks from the number of regular drinks. So, the difference between the two is:  Regular drinks - Dietary drinks = 60 - 19 = 41. Therefore, 41 more regular drinks were consumed than dietary drinks.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 72 glasses of regular soda and 32 glasses of diet soda. So, in total, there are 104 glasses of soda. Now, let's find out how many more glasses of soda than apples there are. We have 78 apples. To do this, we divide the number of apples by the number of glasses of soda: 78 / 104 = 0.75. This means that for every one glass of soda, there are approximately 0.75 apples. Therefore, there are more apples than glasses of soda.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and we want to find out how many glasses of juice are more than the number of apples. So, let's divide the number of apples by the number of glasses of juice per apple:  Number of glasses of juice = Total number of apples / Number of glasses of juice per apple  Number of glasses of juice = 36 apples / 80 glasses of juice (per apple)  Number of glasses of juice = 450 glasses of juice (approximately) Therefore, there were approximately 450 glasses of juice more than the number of apples in the store.;
Response:  We know that there were 30 glasses in total and 28 of them were regular soda glasses. So, we have to find out how many diet soda glasses were left. Since they are equal in number, let's say x diet soda glasses were left. Therefore, the total number of diet soda glasses consumed is 30 - x.;
"Response:  If they consumed more than usual (diétas) drinks, then we can say that their average consumption is x. Since there were 4 bottles of dietary drinks and 79 extra drinks, we have:
x + 4 = 79
Solving for x, we get:
x = 75
So, they consumed 75 bottles of dietary drinks in total.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 57 glasses of regular soda in total. Then, we have 26 glasses of diet soda and 27 glasses of easy drinking soda. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  Total number of glasses = 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 glasses. Therefore, there were 100 glasses of soda in the store.;
"Response:  We know that there are 81 glasses of drink in total. Of these, 60 are dietetic and 60 are easy-to-drink. So we have:

Total number of glasses = 81
Number of dietetic glasses = 60
Number of easy-to-drink glasses = 60

Now, let's find out how many more dietetic glasses were consumed than usual glasses:

Difference between dietetic and usual glasses = Total number of dietetic glasses - Number of usual glasses (60)
= 60 - 60
= 0

So, no more or fewer dietetic glasses were consumed than usual glasses.";
Response:  We know that there were 49 glasses of drink in total. Of those, 40 glasses were dietetic drinks and 6 glasses were light drinks. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of glasses = Number of dietetic glasses + Number of light glasses. In this case, the total number of glasses is 49, so let's substitute this value into our equation: 49 = 40 + x Where 'x' represents the number of light glasses taken. Since there are 6 light glasses, we can solve for 'x': x = 49 - 40 = 9 Therefore, 9 glasses of light drinks were taken.;
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to the Buckingham Palace today and 295 visitors yesterday, then the difference between the two days is: 317 - 295 = 22. So, 22 more people visited the palace today than yesterday.;
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the Buckingham Palace in one day, and Rachel found out about it the next day, then there must have been 703 x 25 = 17,550 visitors to the palace over the course of 25 days.;
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to the Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 666 visitors, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows: 100 - 666 = -566. So, there were 566 fewer visitors at the Buckingham Palace today compared to yesterday.;
Response:  If 406 people visited the Buckingham Palace in the last 327 days and 132 people visited it after we went there to see it, then the number of visitors on the previous day would be:  Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the previous visit  = 406 / 327 = 1.25 x 10^3  So, approximately 1,250 people visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.;
Response:  We know that 45 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday and we want to find out how many visitors came to the palace in the last 85 days. So, let's use the information given in the question:  If 45 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday, then the total number of visitors in the last 85 days is:  Number of days = 85 Total number of visitors = 45 x 85 = 3675 Therefore, on the day in question, the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace was: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / 85 = 3675 / 85 = 43 So, there were 43 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the day in question.;
Response:  If there were 188 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day and then 557 visitors arrived on the same day as us (the day after), that means a total of 745 visitors went to the palace in two days.  Now, if we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (188) from the total number of visitors in two days (745), we get 557 - 188 = 369 visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace over those two days.;
Response:  If there were 661 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on that day and we know that 600 visitors came the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 61 (661 - 600). So, the number of visitors who went to the Buckingham Palace after seeing a particular dish was 61 more than the number of visitors who came the previous day.;
Response:  If 419 people visited the palace yesterday and 103 people visited it the day before yesterday, then the total number of visitors to the palace in the last two days is: 419 + 103 = 522 people.  Therefore, there were 92 - 522 = -430 people who visited the palace today.;
Response:  We know that there were 471 visitors to the Buckingham Palace yesterday and 808 visitors today. So, in total, we have: 471 + 808 = 1279 visitors to the palace over the last 89 days. Now, let's find out how many visitors went to the palace each day: 1279 / 89 = 14.6 visitors per day. Therefore, there were approximately 14.6 visitors to the Buckingham Palace each day over the last 89 days.;
Response:  We know that there were 191 visitors to the palace yesterday (Day 3), and 457 visitors today (Day 4). So, in total, we have: 191 + 457 = 648 visitors to the palace over the past 2 days. Now, let's find out how many visitors went to the palace in the previous 245 days: 648 / 245 = 2.63 visitors per day. Therefore, there were approximately 2.63 visitors to the Buckingham Palace every day for the past 245 days.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 towels and each towel needs 159 grams of wax. So, we need 3 x 159 = 477 grams of wax in total for all three towels. Since there are already 628 grams of wax available, this means that there are 628 - 477 = 151 grams of wax left over after applying it to all three towels. Therefore, there are 151 grams of wax remaining.;
"Response:  We know that we need 49 grams of paint to color all the feathers and we have only 260 grams of wax left. So, we can calculate how much wax is needed as follows:

Total amount of wax required = Number of feathers x Amount of paint per feather
= 288 grams / 49 grams
= 5.7 grams

Therefore, there are 5.7 grams of wax remaining after coloring all the feathers.";
Response:  We know that there are 57 grams of paint needed to color all the feathers and 22 grams of wax left over. If we subtract the amount of paint from the total weight of feathers (353 grams), we get: 353 - 57 = 296 grams. So, there are 296 grams of feathers left after painting them with 57 grams of paint.;
Response:  We know that there are 166 grams of wax needed to connect all the feathers. Currently, we have only 20 grams of wax left. To find out how much more wax is needed, we can divide the total amount of wax required (166 grams) by the remaining amount of wax (20 grams). So, the number of grams of wax needed is: 166 / 20 = 8.3 grams. Therefore, we need an additional 8.3 grams of wax to connect all the feathers.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 towels and each towel requires 0.48 g of wax. So, we need to calculate how much wax is required for all 36 towels.  Therefore, the total amount of wax needed = Number of towels x Amount of wax per towel = 36 x 0.48 = 17.28 g.;
"Response:  We know that there are 11 grams of wax initially and we need 492 grams in total for all feathers. So, we can calculate how much more wax is needed as follows:

Total amount of wax required = Number of feathers x Amount of wax per feather
= 492 grams / 11 grams per feather
= 44 grams

Therefore, there are still 44 grams of wax needed to connect all the feathers.";
Response:  If they can fill 90 hordons in 6 days, that means they will fill 15 hordons per day (90/6 = 15).;
Response:  If they need to fill up 90 hordos of grapes in 5 days, then they will have to collect 18 hordos per day (90/5=18).;
"Response:  We know that in total there are 294 days until the last harvest and we need to fill 146 barrels of wine during this time. Therefore, we can calculate how many barrels of wine we need per day as follows:
Barrels of wine needed = Total number of days x Number of barrels required for each day
= 294 days x 146 barrels
= 43,084 barrels
So, we would need approximately 43,084 barrels of wine over the course of 146 days.";
"Response:  We know that in total there are 235 days until the last harvest and they need to collect 77 hordes of grapes during this time. So we can calculate how many hordes per day:

$ \frac {77}{235} = 0.326 $

So they will need approximately 0.326 hordes of grapes per day.";
"Response:  We know that there are 252 days in a year and 108 hectoliters of wine produced per day. To calculate how many hectoliters of wine will be produced during 58 days, we need to divide the total number of hectoliters by the number of days. So, 
$$ \text {Hectoliter} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Hectoliters}}{\text{Number of Days}} $$
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
$$ \text {Hectoliter} = \frac{252\times 108}{58} = 436.25 \text{ Hectoliter} $$
Therefore, $58$ days later, $436.25$ hectoliters of wine will be produced.";
Response:  If they fill 8 hordons per day and there are 36 days in a season, then they will fill 36 x 8 = 288 hordons during the season. So it takes 288/240 = 1.175 seasons to fill 240 hordons of grapes.;
Response:  We know that there were 26 aquariums for fish and each aquarium had an equal number of fish (so no two aquariums had different numbers). Therefore, we can say that the total number of fish in all 26 aquariums = 26 x Number of fish in one aquarium. Now, we are told that every aquarium had 52 fish, so the total number of fish in all 26 aquariums = 26 x 52 = 1320 fish. So, there are 1320 fish in total across all 26 aquariums.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 fish in total and each aquarium has at least two fish. So, we can start with the first aquarium and assume it contains 2 fish. Then, we move to the second aquarium and add another 2 fish (since there are already 2 fish in the first one). In this way, we continue adding 2 fish to each aquarium until all 40 fish are accounted for. After doing so, we see that there are 8 aquariums ( since 40 / 5 = 8) containing 2 fish each, which means there are 16 aquariums in total. Therefore, the answer is 16.;
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums in total and each aquarium has either saltwater or freshwater animals. So, we can say that the number of saltwater animals is equal to the number of freshwater animals plus 56 (since every aquarium has at least one saltwater animal). Now, let's count the number of saltwater animals:  There are 10 freshwater animals in Tyler's aquarium, so the number of saltwater animals must be 56 - 10 = 46. Therefore, there are 46 saltwater animals in all the other aquariums combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 74 édesvízi and 22 sósvízi aquariums in total. Since each aquarium has 46 animals, we can calculate the number of sósvízi animals as follows: Number of sósvízi animals = Total number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium - Number of édesvízi animals So, the number of sósvízi animals at Tyler's place is: Number of sósvízi animals = 74 x 46 - 22 = 308 Therefore, there are 308 sósvízi animals at Tyler's place.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. So, we have to find out how many animals are in each aquarium.  In total, there are 15 + 62 = 77 aquariums. Since every aquarium has 19 animals, then the total number of animals is 77 x 19 = 1433. Therefore, there are 1433 animals altogether.;
Response:  If there are 13 white polo shirts available and Anya takes 39 of them, then she will have 39 / 13 = 3 bags left over. So, Anya will have 3 bags.;
"Response:  If there are 66 white polo shirts in total and each package contains 3 white polos, then we can calculate the number of packages as follows:

Number of packages = Total number of items / Number of items per package
= 66 / 3
= 22 packages
Therefore, there will be 22 packages containing white polo shirts.";
"Response:  If there are 28 packages and each package contains 56 white polo shirts, then the total number of white polo shirts in all packages is:

$$ = \text {Number of packages} \times \text{ Number of white polo shirts in each package} $$
= $28 \times 56$
= $1492$

Therefore, each package contains $1492 / 28 = 53$ white polo shirts.";
Response:  If there are 53 packages of white polo shirts and Mother takes 57 packages, then she will have 57 - 53 = 4 packages left after taking some. Since each package contains 12 white polos, Mother will have 4 x 12 = 48 white polos left. Therefore, Mother has 48 white polos.;
"Response:  If there are 51 white polos and they can be bought in triple packages, then we need to find out how many triple packages will fit into 51.
To do this, we divide 51 by 3, which gives us 17. So, Anya will get 17 triple packages of white polos.";
Response:  If Anyu takes all 70 white polos, then each of her 14 packages will contain how many white polos?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of white polos in each package = Total number of white polos / Number of packages = 70 / 14 = 5.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 bags and each bag contains 36 sweets. So, we can calculate as follows: Number of sweets in all bags = Number of bags x Number of sweets per bag Total number of sweets = 4 x 36 = 144 Now, let's convert this to fractional form: Fraction of sweets in one bag = Total number of sweets / Number of bags Fraction of sweets in one bag = 144 / 4 = 36 So, there are 36 sweets in each bag.;
Response:  We know that there are 33 sweets in total and each container has 11 sweets. So, we can calculate the number of containers as follows: Number of containers = Total number of sweets / Number of sweets per container = 33 / 11 = 3 containers. Therefore, there are 3 containers of sweets.;
Response:  We know that there are 41 pieces of candy in each bag and we have 53 bags of candy total. So, if we multiply the number of pieces of candy per bag (41) by the number of bags (53), we get the total number of pieces of candy:  Total = Number of pieces of candy per bag x Number of bags = 41 x 53 = 2193. Therefore, there are 2193 pieces of candy in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 sweets in total and 7 bags of sweets. So, we can write this equation:  Total number of sweets = Number of sweets per bag x Number of bags  Total number of sweets = 14  Number of sweets per bag =? (From the problem statement)  Now, let's solve for the number of sweets per bag: Number of sweets per bag = Total number of sweets / Number of bags  Number of sweets per bag = 14 / 7  Number of sweets per bag = 2  Therefore, each bag contains 2 sweets.;
Response:  We have 3 sweets in each jar, and we have 21 jars of sweets altogether. So, if we divide the total number of sweets (21) by the number of sweets per jar (3), we get the number of jars of sweets: 21 / 3 = 7 jars of sweets. Therefore, there are 7 jars of sweets.;
Response:  We know that there are 26 bags of sweets and each bag contains 30 pieces of sweets. So, in total, we have 26 x 30 = 780 pieces of sweets. Now, let's find out how many bags of sweets are left if there were initially 15 candies and now there are 52 more. To do this, we need to divide the number of remaining candies (52) by the number of candies in one bag (30): 52 / 30 = 1.73 bags. Therefore, there are approximately 1.73 bags of sweets left after consuming 52 additional ones.;
Response:  We know that there are 14 zacskók and 28 pieces of sweets in total. So, we can calculate how many pieces of sweets each zacskó contains as follows: Number of pieces of sweets per zacskó = Total number of pieces of sweets / Number of zacskók = 28 / 14 = 2.07 (approximately) Therefore, there are approximately 2 zacskók worth of sweets.;
"Response:  If there are 5 houses in each tome and the postal worker has to deliver 25 letters to each house, then the total number of letters delivered is:

$$ \text {Total letters} = 5 \times 25 = 125 $$

Now, we need to find out how many tomes it takes to deliver all the letters. Since each tome has 5 houses, we can divide the total number of letters by 5 to get the number of tomes:

$$ \text{Number of tomes} = \frac{\text{Total letters}}{5} = \frac{125}{5} = 25 $$

Therefore, there are 25 houses in one tome.";
Response:  If there are 9 posts to be delivered and each house has 20 houses in its neighborhood, then we need to deliver 9 x 20 = 180 posts in total. So, the postal worker can deliver 180 emails per household.;
Response: 1) The number of houses in the village is 6. 2) A postal worker needs to deliver 24 packages to each house. Therefore, the total number of packages that need to be delivered = 6 x 24 = 144 packages. So, the postal worker will have to deliver 144 packages in total.;
Response:  If there are $n$ houses in a street and each house receives $2$ letters, then the total number of letters sent to all houses is $\text{2} \times n$. Since each letter has a weight of $1$, the total weight of all letters sent to all houses is $\text{2} \times n \times 1 = n$. Therefore, if the weight of one letter is equal to $1$, then there must be $n$ houses in the street.;
Response:  We have to deliver 32 packages to each house in the village. Since there are 20 houses in total, we need to divide 32 by 20 to find out how many packages we need to deliver to each house. So, we will deliver 1.6 packages (32/20) to each house.;
Response:  We know that there are 78 houses in total and each house has 19 mailboxes. So, we need to divide 78 by 19 to find out how many emails can be delivered to each house.  Therefore, the number of emails that the postal worker can deliver to each house is 78/19 = 4.  Hence, the postal worker can deliver 4 emails to each of the 78 houses.;
Response:  If there are 8 posts to be delivered and each house has 5 people, then the total number of houses is 8 x 5 = 40 houses.  Since the postal worker sent 32 letters to each house, the total number of letters sent is 32 x 40 = 1280 letters. Therefore, there are 1280 / 32 = 40 houses in one tomebb.;
Response:  We have to divide 81 houses into groups of 4 houses each. Since there are 12 houses in each group, we need to divide 81 by 12 = 6.75 groups. So, the postal worker can deliver 6.75 emails per group. Therefore, the total number of emails delivered is 6.75 x 4 = 26.75 emails.;
Response:  We have to deliver 4 packages to each of the 16 houses. So, in total, we need to deliver 4 x 16 = 64 packages. Since there are 17 houses in each tome, and we need to deliver 64 packages, we will divide 64 by 17 to get the number of packages that each house needs to receive: 64 / 17 = 3 packages per house. Therefore, we need to deliver 3 packages to each of the 16 houses.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. She wants to divide them into groups of four each. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources. To do this, we can use division. Division is when you divide a number by another number to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 10 (the number of eggs) by 4 (the number of groups). When we divide 10 by 4, we get 2.5. This means that Rebecca can make 2.5 groups of four eggs each. Since there are 20 marbles, she can also make 20 / 4 = 5 groups of five marbles each. Therefore, Rebecca can make 2.5 groups of eggs and 5 groups of marbles.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 golf balls and 15 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 4, then how many groups can she make? Well, we need to divide both quantities (golf balls and eggs) by 4. So, if we divide 10 golf balls by 4, we get 2.5 golf balls per group. Similarly, if we divide 15 eggs by 4, we get 3.75 eggs per group. Since you cannot have a fraction of an egg, we will round up to 4 eggs per group. Therefore, Rebecca can make 4 groups with her available resources.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 people in total and each person has 2 eggs. So, we need to divide 11 into groups of 2. Since there are 11 people, we can make 5 groups of 2 people each. Now, let's count how many eggs are left for Rebecca. There are 5 groups of 2 people each, so each group has 2 eggs (since each person has 2 eggs). Therefore, there are 10 eggs left for Rebecca ( since she is not included in any of the groups). So, the answer is 10.;
Response: 1) We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 bullets. So she can divide them into 4 groups of 2 eggs each (or 3 groups of 3 eggs each). 2) Since there are 4 or 3 groups, each group will have 2 or 3 eggs respectively. Therefore, there will be 2 x 2 = 4 eggs in total in all the groups combined.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 golf balls and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  Group 1: Since Rebecca has 4 golf balls, she can give 4/3 = 1 egg to this group. Therefore, there will be 15 - 1 = 14 eggs in Group 1.  Group 2: Since Rebecca has 4 golf balls left after giving 1 egg to Group 1, she can give 4/2 = 2 eggs to this group. Therefore, there will be 15 - 2 = 13 eggs in Group 2.  Group 3: Since Rebecca has no golf balls left after giving 2 eggs to Groups 1 and 2, she cannot give any eggs to this group. Therefore, there will be 0 eggs in Group 3.  So, the number of eggs in each group is: Group 1: 14 eggs Group 2: 13 eggs Group 3: 0 eggs;
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups. Each group must contain at least one egg. So, we can start with Group 1, which will have 18 eggs / 1 = 18 groups. Now, let's count how many bananas and marbles each group will get: Group 1 - 72 bananas / 18 groups = 4 bananas per group; Group 1 - 66 marbles / 18 groups = 3.75 marbles per group. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we will round up to 4 groups for bananas and 4 groups for marbles. Therefore, there are 4 groups in total.";
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many bananas and eggs each group will have.  Group 1: Bananas - 33 (since there are 99 total bananas and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups). Eggs - 3 ( since there are 9 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups).  Group 2: Bananas - 30 (since there are 99 total bananas and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups). Eggs - 4 (since there are 9 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups).  Group 3: Bananas - 36 (since there are 99 total bananas and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups). Eggs - 2 (since there are 9 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups). Therefore, Rebecca can create 3 groups with the following numbers of bananas and eggs: Group 1 - 33/9 = 4 bananas and 3 eggs; Group 2 - 30/9 = 3.33 bananas and 4 eggs; Group 3 - 36/9 = 4.2 bananas and 2 eggs.";
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 golf balls. If we subtract the number of golf balls from the total number of eggs, we get:  Number of eggs left = Total number of eggs - Number of golf balls = 20 - 6 = 14 eggs. So, Rebecca still has 14 eggs after giving away some golf balls.;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 golf balls and 12 eggs. She wants to divide them into groups of 20. So she will have 5 groups of 20 + 1 group of 12 = 105 objects in total. Since each egg can be divided equally among 4 golf balls (since there are 4 golf balls per group), Rebecca will have 105 / 4 = 26 eggs left after dividing them among the golf balls. Therefore, Rebecca still has 12 - 26 = -14 eggs more than the number of golf balls she has.;
Response:  If Luke played $n$ games and scored $\boxed{p}$ points in each game, then he totalled $\boxed{np}$ points overall. Since he scored 154 points in total, we can set up the equation: $\boxed{np} = 154$. Solving for $\boxed{n}$, we get: $\boxed{n} = \frac{\boxed{154}}{\boxed{p}}$. So, if Luke played $\boxed{n}$ games, he scored $\boxed{np}$ points in total.;
"Response:  If Luke played 7 rounds in the trivia game and scored 46 points each round, then he scored a total of:

$ \text {Total score} = $\text{Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round}$
= $7 \times 46$
= $302$

Therefore, Luke scored $302$ points in the entire trivia game.";
Response:  If Luke scored $84 points in two rounds of a game and he scores the same number of points each round, then he scores $84/2 = $42 points per round.;
Response:  If Luke scored points in every game he played and he played 157 games, then he must have scored total points. So, we can write an equation as follows: Points = Number of Games x Point per Game Now, we know that Luke scored points in each game, so the number of points he scored in one game is equal to his average score per game. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our previous equation: Points = Number of Games x Point per Game Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Points = 157 x Point per Game Since we are asked for the total number of points Luke scored, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 157: Total Points = Number of Games x Point per Game Multiplying both sides of the equation by 157 gives us: Total Points = 157 x Point per Game Solving for the point per game, we get: Point per Game = Total Points / Number of Games This means that if Luke scored points in every game he played, then his average score per game was points.;
Response:  If Luke scored 3 points in each round and played 78 rounds in total, then he would have scored 78 x 3 = 234 points overall. So, he must have played at least 234 / 3 = 78 rounds. Therefore, Luke played exactly 78 rounds in the game.;
Response:  We know that Emily made 32 necklaces using two gemstones. So, she used 16 gemstones in total (2 x 8 = 16). Since each necklace requires one gemstone, we can conclude that they needed 16 gemstones to make all of the necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 16.;
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace contains 28 beads. So, in total, she used 28 x 11 = 308 beads to make all of them. Therefore, there are 308 - 28 = 280 beads left after making all 11 necklaces. Since we started with 28 beads per necklace, this means that Emily had 280 / 28 = 9 beads remaining at the end. So, the final number of beads Emily had was 9.;
Response:  If Emily has 16 gyöngyek and she makes one necklace with 8 gyöngyek per necklace, then how many necklaces can she make in total?  We need to divide the number of gyöngyek she has (16) by the number of gyöngyek per necklace (8):  $16 \div 8 = 2$ So, Emily can make $2$ necklaces.;
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 necklaces for her friends and each necklace requires 6 beads. So, we need to find out how many beads are required in total to make all those necklaces.  Therefore, the number of beads needed is: 18 x 6 = 108.;
Response:  If Emily made 4 necklaces with 5 beads each, then she used a total of 20 beads (5 x 4 = 20). So there were originally 20 beads in total. Since Emily gave some away as gifts, there are now fewer beads left. Therefore, the number of beads that remain is equal to the original amount minus the number of beads given away. In this case, the number of beads remaining is 20 - 4 = 16. So there are 16 beads left after Emily gave them away as gifts.;
"Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend gets a necklace with 3 gems, then the total number of necklaces that Emily can make is:

72 x 3 = 216

So, Emily can make 216 necklaces in total.";
Response:  We know that Emily made 20 necklaces and each necklace required 5 beads. So, in total, she used 5 x 20 = 100 beads to make all the necklaces. Since there were 43 friends, we need to divide the number of beads used (100) by the number of friends (43): 100 / 43 = 2.36. Therefore, Emily needed approximately 2-3 beads per friend to make one necklace.;
Response:  We know that Emily made 26 necklaces and each necklace has 2 pearls. So, in total, she made 26 x 2 = 52 pearls. Since there are 44 friends, we need to divide the number of pearls by 44 to find out how many pearls were given to each friend. Therefore, the answer is 52 / 44 = 1.17 (approximately) pearls per friend.;
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children in camp = Total number of children - Number of children at home.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children in camp = 819058 - 668278 = 150777. Therefore, 150777 children spent the summer vacation at camp out of the total 819058 children.;
Response:  We know that 202958 children went to camp and 777622 children stayed at home. So, we need to find out how many children stayed at home compared to those who went to camp. To do this, we can use the ratio of the number of children who stayed at home to the number of children who went to camp. The ratio is: Number of children who stayed at home / Number of children who went to camp = 777622 / 202958 = 3841/506 = 75.8. Therefore, there are 75.8 times more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.;
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and 629424 of them go to camp during summer vacation. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home. To do this, we can divide the number of children who don't go to camp (i.e., those who stay at home) by the total number of children: Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who go to camp Number of children who stay at home = 898051 - 629424 Number of children who stay at home = 268627 Therefore, 268627 children stay at home during summer vacation.;
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in total and during summer break, 274865 children stay at home while others go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children go to camp from those who stayed at home. To do this, we can use division.  Division is used when you want to divide one quantity into equal parts or groups based on a specific number. In this case, we will divide 274865 (the number of children who go to camp) by 313473 (the total number of children).  Therefore, the answer is:  Number of children who go to camp = 274865 / 313473 = 87.;
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County. Out of these, 455682 go to camp. So, the number of children who do not go to camp is: 907611 - 455682 = 451939. Therefore, there are 451939 children in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that out of 800059 children, 800059 - 828521 = 376478 stayed at home in Lawrence County. Therefore, 376478 children remained at home in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children left at home and 91676 children in total in Lawrence County. So, if we divide the number of children who went to camp (61619) by the total number of children in Lawrence County (91676), we get:  $\frac{61619}{91676} = \boxed{0.68}$ or $68\%$. Therefore, approximately $68\%$ of the children in Lawrence County went to summer camp.;
Response:  We know that there are 34044 children who go to summer camp and 134867 children who stay at home. So, in total, we have 47511 (34044 + 134867) children. Now, let's consider those from the countryside. There are 424944 children from the countryside who participate in the camp. Therefore, the number of children in the camp is equal to 47511 + 424944 = 479655 children.;
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children who go to summer camp and 590796 children who stay at home. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is: 610769 + 590796 = 1201565. Since 22 children came from outside the county, we subtract them from the total number of children: 1201565 - 22 = 1201343. Therefore, there are 1201343 children in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children who stayed at home during summer vacation and 893835 children who went to camp. Additionally, 78 children came from outside the county. So, we need to find out how many children are in total in Lawrence County. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who stayed at home with the number of children who went to camp:  Number of children in Lawrence County = (Number of children who stayed at home x Number of children who went to camp) + (Number of children who came from outside the county)  In this case, we have: Number of children in Lawrence County = (644997 x 893835) + 78 = 562017 + 78 = 562895 Therefore, there are approximately 562895 children in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that Adam has three almonds belonging to Jackie. So, in total, Adam has 9 almonds (3 + 6 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 almonds belonging to Jackie.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has two apples. So, if we give one apple to Jackie, then he will have three apples (2 + 1 = 3). Now, we need to find out how many apples Adam gave to Jackie. Since Adam had 10 apples initially, and now he has only 9 apples left after giving one to Jackie, so Adam gave 1 apple to Jackie. Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the total number of apples that Jackie has, we get:   $ Number of apples that Jackie has = 10 - 9 = 1$ Therefore, Jackie got 1 apple from Adam.;
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. So, if we give one apple to Adam, then he will have 9 apples (8 + 1 = 9). Now, we need to find out how many apples Jackie got from Adam. Since Jackie had 10 apples initially and now Adam has 9 apples, it means that Jackie got 1 apple from Adam. Therefore, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. If they had fewer than 4 apples together, then Adam would have more than 2 apples (since he has 3). So we can conclude that Adam has 3 apples. Therefore, there are 3 + 3 = 6 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 9 apples more than they had alone. So, if they had x apples when they were alone, then they have 9 + x apples together. Since we are told that Adam has 3 apples, we can write: 3 + x = 12 (since Jackie has 5 apples). Solving for x, we get:  x = 6. Therefore, there are 6 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 8 more almonds than he and Jackie together have. So, if they have 12 almonds in total, then Adam has 4 (12 - 8) almonds. Therefore, there are 4 almonds left after Adam takes his share.;
Response:  We know that Adam has four apples and Jackie has ten apples. So together they have two apples (Adam + Jackie = 2). Now we are asked how many apples Adam has. Since he has more than half of the total number of apples (6), then Adam must have at least 3 apples (since 6 is greater than 5, which is half of 10). Therefore, Adam has 3 apples.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 apples and Jackie has 89 oranges plus 11 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the total number of fruits she has (oranges + apples), we get:  Number of fruits Jackie has = 89 + 11 = 100.  Now, let's divide the number of fruits Adam has by the number of fruits Jackie has to find out how many apples Adam has:  Number of apples Adam has = 5 / 100 = 0.05. Therefore, Adam has 5 apples.;
Response:  Yesterday (Tuesday), Helen baked 419 cookies. Today is Wednesday, so she baked 270 cookies this morning and 31 cookies last night. Therefore, Helen baked a total of 680 cookies yesterday and today combined.;
Response:  Yesterday (téged), Helen made 90 chicken skewers and today she made 51 beef skewers. So far, Helen has made a total of 90 + 51 = 141 skewers. Since there are 484 chicken skewers in total, we can calculate how many chicken skewers Helen made by dividing the total number of skewers by the number of beef skewers: 141 / 51 = 2.76. Therefore, Helen made approximately 2.76 chicken skewers yesterday and today combined.;
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 527 chicken suts and today she made 86 more chicken suts. So, yesterday she made 527 + 86 = 613 chicken suts in total. Similarly, she also made 554 cakes and 86 roses. Therefore, Helen made a total of 613 + 554 + 86 = 1253 suts in all.  Hence, Helen sutted 1253 chicken suts.;
"Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 144 cookies and 397 roses. Today, she baked 85 rose slices and 403 chocolate slices. So, in total, Helen baked 229 (85 + 403) slices of cake today. Therefore, Helen baked 229 mazsolás sütit (mazsolás means ""cake"" in Hungarian).";
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 19 cakes and today she made 231 rosin slices and 237 chokeberry slices. So, in total, Helen has made 250 slices of different types of pastries (19 + 231 + 237 = 250). Now, we need to find out how many chocolate chip cookies are among these 250 slices. Since there is no information about the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen made yesterday or today, we can assume that each type of pastry has an equal chance of being chosen for the celebration. Therefore, the probability of any given slice being a chocolate chip cookie is 1/4 (since there are 4 types of pastries: cake, rose, chokeberry, and chocolate chip cookie). So, the number of chocolate chip cookies among the 250 slices is:  Number of chocolate chip cookies = Total number of slices x Probability of being a chocolate chip cookie  Number of chocolate chip cookies = 250 x (1/4) = 62.5 chocolate chip cookies.;
Response:  Tegnap (yesterday) Helen sütött 197 csoki sütit, and today she sütött 75 rosinsütit and 66 csoki sütit. So, the total number of chicken slices that Helen sütött yesterday is 197 + 75 = 272.;
Response:  Tegnap Helen 519 csoki sütit és 300 mazsolás sütit sütött. Ma reggel Helen 280 rosinsütit és 359 csoki sütit sütött. So, if we subtract the number of rosins she made today from the total number of sürtits she made yesterday, we get:  Number of mazsolás sütit Helen made yesterday - 280 = 300. Therefore, Helen made 300 mazsolás sütit yesterday.;
Response:  We know that Katie played 81 games and her friends played 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie played than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends played from the number of games Katie played. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie played 22 more games than her friends.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games for her new friends and they have 88 games together. So, the total number of games for Katie's old friends is 53 + 88 = 141 games. Therefore, there are 141 games among all of Katie's friends altogether.;
"Response: 
Katie has 78 new and 86 old games, so she has a total of 164 games.
Her friends have 48 new games, which is equal to 48/2 = 24 old games.
So, together they have 164 + 24 = 188 games.";
"Response: 
Katie has 8 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 27 games (8 + 19 = 27). 
Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69 = 77).  Therefore, there are 50 games in total (27 + 77 = 50).";
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 62 + 80 = 142 games.  We also know that her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so they have a total of 73 + 41 = 114 games. Therefore, the number of old games that Katie's friends have is 114 - 73 = 41.;
"Response:  We know that Katie has 57 games and her friends have 63 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:

57 - 63 = -6
So, Katie has 6 fewer games than her friends.";
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old ones, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Now we need to find out how many games each of her friends have given her. According to the question, they gave her 34 new games, which means they have 34 - 34 = 0 new games left. So, all of their games are old ones. Therefore, the number of old games that Katie's friends have is 39 x 3 = 117.  Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of games Katie has and the number of games her friends have: 96 - 117 = -21.  So, Katie has more games than her friends do.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and now he has $57. So, he lost $3. Then, we know that Jason had $19 last week and now he has $33. So, he gained $14. Finally, we are told that Jason earned $33 from washing cars over the weekend. Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is $33 + $14 = $47.;
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and earned $9 this week, so his current balance is $95 ($86 + $9). 
Jason had $5 last week and didn't work this week, so he still has $5. Therefore, their combined balance now is $95 + $5 = $100.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 last week and bought cars worth $40 during the weekend. So his new balance is:  $19 + ($40 / 2) = $19 + $20 = $39. Now, let's consider Jason's situation. He had $16 last week and bought cars worth $69 during the weekend. So his new balance is: $16 + ($69 / 2) = $16 + $34.5 = $50.5. Therefore, Fred earned $39 - $50.5 = -$11.5 more than Jason during the weekend.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and spent some money on cars. So, his remaining amount of money is less than $114. Secondly, we know that Jason had $22 last week and bought some more cars. So, his remaining amount of money is greater than $22. Thirdly, we are told that Fred has $21 dollars now and Jason has $78 dollars now. Therefore, the difference between their current amounts of money is $57 ($78 - $21). Finally, we are asked how much Jason earned during the weekend. Since he earned $57 more than Fred, Jason earned $57 + $21 = $78 dollars during the weekend.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 last week and now he has $115. So, he gained $4. Secondly, we know that Jason had $40 last week and now he has $44. So, he gained $4 as well. Finally, we are told that they both worked for 7 days in total. Therefore, their combined earnings from working during those 7 days is equal to the sum of their individual daily earnings multiplied by the number of days they worked. Using this logic, we can calculate the amount earned from delivering newspapers as follows:  $115 + $44 = $159. Since they worked for 7 days, their daily earnings from newspaper delivery would be $22.3 (=$159 / 7). Now, let's find out how much money Fred made from washing cars. We know that he made $111 last week and now he has $115, so he gained $4. Therefore, his daily earnings from car washing were $4/7 = $0.57 per day ($115 / 7).;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 last week and now he has $112. So, he earned $63 in one week. Secondly, we know that Jason had $3 last week and now he has $63. So, he spent $50 in one week. Therefore, Jason earned $63 - $50 = $13 from delivering newspapers.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 last week and now he has $14. So, he earned $17 during the week ($31 - $14 = $17).  Secondly, we know that Fred had $78 last week and now he has $90. So, he earned $12 during the week ($78 - $90 = -$12). As Jason earned $17 more than Fred, so the total amount of money earned by both is $17 + $12 = $29. Therefore, Jason earned $17 and Fred earned $12.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 last week and Jason had $95 last week. Then, when Fred delivered newspapers, he earned $16 for his work. Next, when Fred washed cars, he earned $74. So, how much did Fred earn in total during the weekend? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount earned by Fred = Amount earned from delivering newspapers + Amount earned from washing cars = $16 + $74 = $90 Therefore, Fred earned $90 during the weekend.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and then he earned $111 for delivering newspapers. So his new total amount of money is: $47 + $111 = $158. Next, we learn that Jason gave him $99. Therefore, Fred's current balance is: $158 + $99 = $257.;
Response:  First, we know that Jessie started with a weight of 71 kg. Then, she lost 20 kg through exercise every day. So, her current weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 51 kg.;
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. If she lost 101 kg after running for some time, then her original weight must have been:

Weight before running = Weight after running - Amount of weight lost
= 27 kg - 101 kg
= -74 kg

So, Jessie's weight before starting to run was -74 kg.";
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. Now she weighs 66 kg. So, her weight before running was 126 - 66 = 60 kg.;
"Response:  We know that Jessie started running every day and lost weight. The initial weight was 69 kg, and after 35 days of running, he lost 35 kg. So, his current weight is:

Current weight = Initial weight - Loss in weight (in kg) x Number of days
= 69 kg - 35 kg x 35 days
= 69 kg - 1225 kg
= 556 kg

Therefore, Jessie's current weight is approximately 556 kg.";
Response:  First week (Jessie runs 50 kg):  Jessie's weight before running = 114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg Second week (Jessie runs 60 kg):  Jessie's weight after first week = 64 kg + 60 kg = 124 kg Now we know that Jessie gained 60 kg in the second week. So, his current weight is: 124 kg - 60 kg = 64 kg Therefore, Jessie's current weight is 64 kg.;
Response:  First day (Jessie started running):  Jessie weighed 9 kg initially. If he ran for x hours and burned 62 kcal/kg/hr, then he burned total of 578 kcal = 62 x 9 = 578 kcal. Since he lost weight, his initial weight was less than 9 kg. So, let's assume his initial weight was w kg. Then, after one day, his new weight is:  New weight = Initial weight - Burned calories = w - 578 = 9 - 578 = 470 kg.  Second day (Jessie continued running): Now, Jessie has run for another day, so he burned more calories. Let's assume he burned 140 kcal/kg/hr again. If he ran for y hours, then he burned total of 140 x 9 = 1260 kcal = 140 x 10 = 1400 kcal. Again, since he lost weight, his new weight is less than his previous weight. So, his new weight after second day is: New weight = Initial weight - Burned calories = w - 1400 = 470 - 1400 = -930 kg.  Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg.;
Response:  First week (Jessie's weight before starting to run): $J = 92$ kg Second week (Jessie's weight after running for one week): $J' = \frac{99}{56} J = 1.73$ kg So, in the first week, Jessie lost $\text {($92 - $1.73) = } $88.27$ kg of weight$.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the enclosure. If 64 snakes hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from the total initial snake population. So, the remaining snakes are: 95 - 64 = 31. Now, let's check how many alligators remained hidden: 61 - (number of snakes hiding) = 61 - 64 = -3. Therefore, 31 snakes did not hide themselves, and 3 alligators hid themselves.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 93 snakes and 97 alligators in the cage. If 40 of them hid themselves, then we have to subtract this number from both groups. So, the number of non-hiding snakes is:  $93 - 40 = 53$ And the number of non-hiding alligators is: $97 - 40 = 57$ Therefore, $53$ snake;
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 kígyók and 75 aligátok in the cage. If we add 82 more kígyók to this number, then the total number of snakes will be:  Total no. of kígyók = Initial no. of kígyók + Additional no. of kígyók = 3 + 82 = 85 kígyók Now, let's find out how many aligators are left after adding these new kígyók. The initial number of aligators was 75, so if we subtract the number of kígyók from it, we get: Number of aligators remaining = Original no. of aligators - No. of kígyók remaining = 75 - 85 = -10 aligators Therefore, 10 aligators did not reptile into hiding.;
Response:  We know that there were 79 animals in total in the enclosure. If 24 of them are kígyók and 51 are aligátorok, then we can say that the number of non-reptiles (i.e., birds or mammals) is equal to 79 - (24 + 51). Therefore, the number of non-reptiles = 79 - 75 = 4. So, there were 4 animals that did not hide themselves.;
Response:  If the farmer had 171 tomatoes yesterday and today he chose 134 of them, then he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left in his garden now. Since today he picked 30 more tomatoes from his garden, so after today he will have 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes remaining in his garden.;
Response:  Tegnap (yesterday) the farmer harvested 56 tomatoes from his garden. Today he has chosen 41 of them. So, the number of tomatoes left for him after yesterday's harvest is: 56 - 41 = 15.;
Response:  If the farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he picked 154 today, then he must have left with 66 (90 - 154) tomatoes. Now, if he picked 50 tomatoes today, that means he has 116 tomatoes left (66 + 50). So, the number of tomatoes the farmer collected is 116.;
Response:  We know that the farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 cucumbers in his garden. If he picked 172 cucumbers, then we can say that he has 3 tomatoes (175 - 172 = 3) and 49 cucumbers (77 - 172 = 49) left in his garden. So, there are 3 tomatoes and 49 cucumbers remaining in the farmer's garden after picking 172 cucumbers.;
Response:  We know that initially, the farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 cucumbers in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, then we can say that he has (177 - 53) = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he picked 12 cucumbers, then he has (12) = 12 cucumbers left. So, the final number of tomatoes and cucumbers owned by the farmer is 124 + 12 = 136.;
Response:  If the farmer had initially 105 green and 71 red tomatoes in his garden, then he has collected 137 tomatoes altogether (including both green and red ones). So, after collecting 137 tomatoes, the number of remaining green tomatoes is: Number of green tomatoes = Initial quantity of green tomatoes - Amount collected = 105 - 137 = -32 The question asks how many green tomatoes are left, so we need to find out what negative value means here. In this case, it means that there are 32 more green tomatoes than before, i.e., 32 + 105 = 137. Therefore, there are 137 green tomatoes left in the garden after collecting 137 tomatoes.;
Response:  If four right angles are needed to connect all the walls of the house, and each wall requires two right angles to be connected, then we need 4/2 = 2 tables for John to attach to the house walls. Therefore, John needs 2 tables to attach to the house walls.;
Response:  We have to use 13 large beams and we need 17 angles for each beam. So, in total, we will need 229 angles (13 x 17 = 229). But then we also need 8 angles to connect the smaller beams, so the final answer is 237 angles (229 + 8 = 237).;
Response:  We know that total number of right angles (90 degrees) is given as 11. Since each desk requires 3 right angles for fixing, we need 11/3 = 3 desks. So, John needs 3 desks for building the house wall.;
Response:  We have to use 12 large and 10 small planks for building the wall of the house. If we need 15 angles to fix the big planks, then how many angles do we need to fix the small planks? As there are 10 small planks, we need 50 angles (10 x 5 = 50) to fix them. So, in total, John needs 65 angles (15 + 50) to build the wall of the house.;
Response:  We know that John needs to attach 16 pieces of wood to the walls of his house using two screws each. Therefore, he will need 32 screws in total. So, the number of right angles required is 32 / 90 = 0.357 (approximately).;
Response:  We know that there are 8 big beams used to build the walls of the house. Each beam is divided into 74 pieces (angles) to hold them in place. So, we need to calculate how many beams are needed for one wall. Since each wall needs 74 angles, and since there are 8 beams per wall, we can conclude that John needs 6 sections of wood (beams) for each wall. Therefore, John needs 8 x 6 = 48 sections of wood for all four walls.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 large planks and 17 small planks in total.  Since each large plank is used to make 14 right angles, we need (12 x 14) = 168 large planks for one side of the house. Similarly, since each small plank is used to make 25 right angles, we need (17 x 25) = 425 small planks for one side of the house. Therefore, John needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 desks for both sides of the house.;
Response:  We know that there are 42 rágók in total and each package contains 3 rágók. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of rágók = Number of packages x Number of rágók per package  Total number of rágók = 42 x x  Since we want to find out how many packages Robin has, we need to solve for x.  To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:  Total number of rágók / Number of rágók per package = x / 3  Now, let's substitute the value given in the question:  Total number of rágók / Number of rágók per package = 42 / 3  Solving for x, we get:  x = 14  Therefore, Robin has 14 packages.;
Response:  We know that there are 43 packages of gum and each package has 23 pieces of gum inside. So, in total, there are 43 x 23 = 1006 pieces of gum. Now, we need to find out how many extra pieces of gum Robin has. Since Robin has 8 extra pieces of gum, we can subtract this number from the total amount of gum to get the number of gum that Robin actually has. Therefore, the final answer is:  Number of gum for Robin = Total number of gum - Extra gum for Robin = 1006 - 8 = 998 pieces of gum.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 rugs in each package and Robin has 6 additional rugs. So, the total number of rugs is 7 + 6 = 13. Since Robin has all the pieces, he must have 13 packages. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is: 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum. So, there are 112 pieces of gum in total for Robin.;
Response:  We know that there are 21 packages of Robin and each package contains 9 candies. So, in total, we have 21 x 9 = 189 candies of Robin. Now, we also know that there are 45 packages of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies is 189 + 45 = 234 candies.;
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of Robin and each package contains 6 candies. So, we can calculate as follows: Total number of candies = Number of packages x Number of candies in each package = 28 x 6 = 168 candies. Therefore, Robin has 168 candies.;
Response:  The industrial machine can make 3 poles per minute. So in total, it made 6 poles (3 x 2 = 6). Since it took 1 hour to produce these poles, we can calculate the time taken for each pole as follows: Time taken = Number of poles / Speed  Time taken = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes.;
Response:  If the industrial machine worked for 5 minutes and could produce 4 poles in one minute, then it produced 4 x 5 = 20 poles during its entire work time of 5 minutes. Therefore, the number of poles produced by the machine is 20.;
Response:  Tegnap (yesterday) the machine made 9 poles, and today it made 44 poles. So, the increase in number of poles is 36 (44 - 9). Since the machine can make 3 poles per minute, we need to divide the increase in number of poles by the time taken to make one pole:  Increase in poles / Time taken to make one pole = 36 / 1 = 36 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 36 minutes yesterday.;
Response:  If the industrial machine produced 13 poles yesterday and 3 poles today, then it means that its production rate decreased by 9 (13 - 3) poles per day.  Since it takes 1 minute to produce 8 poles, we can calculate the time taken for producing all 9 poles as follows: Time = Number of poles / Production rate per minute = 9 / 8 = 1.125 minutes Therefore, the industrial machine worked for approximately 1.125 minutes.;
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 poles in total. Today, it made 8 poles. So, the difference between yesterday and today is 1 pole. If the machine can make two poles in one minute, then it worked for (2/1) = 1 minute to make 1 additional pole today. Therefore, the machine worked for 1 + 9 = 10 minutes altogether.;
Response:  Yesterday (t = -1), the machine produced 4 poles per minute. Today (t = 0), it produces 8 poles per minute. So, the increase in production is 2 poles/minute (8 - 4). To find out how many minutes this increase lasted, we need to divide the total time by the increase in production:  Time = Total time / Increase in production = 60 min / 2 pole/min = 30 min  Therefore, the machine worked for 30 minutes.;
Response:  If the industrial machine can produce 6 poles per minute yesterday and today it produces 8 poles per minute, then we need to calculate how many poles were produced in total. We know that the time period is 12 minutes yesterday and 14 minutes today. So, let's multiply the number of poles produced per minute with the time period: Yesterday - 6 x 12 = 72 poles Today - 8 x 14 = 112 poles Therefore, the industrial machine produced a total of 72 + 112 = 184 poles.;
Response:  Yesterday, the machine could make 5 poles in an hour, so it made 5 x 5 = 25 poles altogether yesterday. Today, it can make 12 poles in an hour, so it made 12 x 6 = 72 poles altogether today. Therefore, the number of poles made by the machine today is 72 - 25 = 47 more than yesterday. So, the machine made 47 additional poles today.;
"Response:  If the game brought $165 in total over 5 days, and it brought the same amount every day, then we can calculate the daily amount as follows:

$165 / 5 = $33 per day";
"Response:  The game brought $144 per day, and it was played for 22 days during Carnival. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is:

$144 x 22 = $3,088

So, the game earned $3,088 during Carnival.";
"Response:  We know that the game brought $420 in total over 30 days and $22 with the game. So we can write an equation as follows: Total amount = Number of days x Amount per day  Now let's solve for ""Number of days"": Number of days = Total amount / Amount per day  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = $420 / $22  Number of days = 19 days Therefore, the game brought $22 every day.";
Response:  First 44 days: $382 \times 44 = $16,596$ Total revenue for first 44 days = $16,596$ Next 10 days: $374 \times 10 = $3,740$ Total revenue for remaining 10 days = $3,740$Total revenue = $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336$So, they earned together $20,336$.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that in total, the game brought $120 during the first 20 days and $66 during the remaining 16 days. So, if we divide the total amount of money earned ($186) by the number of days (46), we get the average daily income as follows:  $$ \therefore Avg Daily Income = \frac {Total Amount} {Number of Days} = \frac {186}{46} = 4$  Therefore, the karneválon the gyűrűdobó játék brought around $4 per day during the first 20 days.;
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the carnival was $325 for the first 154 days and $114 for the remaining 57 days. To find out how much was earned per day in the remaining 57 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left in the carnival ($57). So, the daily earnings were $ $114 / $57 = $2.00 per day. Therefore, the carnival earned $2 per day in the remaining 57 days.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packages of bread and took 4 packages of cake instead of bread, then she bought 6 packages of bread less than she bought of cake (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 more packages of cake than bread). So, Lucy bought 6 packages of bread less than she bought of cake.;
Response:  Firstly, Lucy took 4 packages of bread (22 + 16 = 38). So she took 38 packages of food in total.;
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 packages of food and some packages of candy, then she must have bought at least 23 + x packages of candy where x is the number of packages of candy she bought. Since she also bought some packages of torta, let's assume that she bought y packages of torta. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 23 + x = 27 (number of packages of food) - y (number of packages of torta). Solving for x, we get: x = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packages of candy.;
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packages of bread and 12 packages of cake. So she spent $2 \times 2 = 4$ dollars on bread and $12 \times 1 = 12$ dollars on cake. Therefore, the total amount of money Lucy spent is $4 + 12 = 16$. Since there are 56 dollars left after buying everything, we can conclude that Lucy bought a total of $56 - 16 = 40$ packages of food.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 people in the bus and then 4 more got on. So, the total number of people now in the bus is:  Initially, there were 12 people + 4 new passengers = 16 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 people boarded and 3 people got off. So, now there are... (8 + 12 - 3) = 17 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 people on the bus (the initial number). Then, 9 more people boarded the bus (the difference between the total number of people and the initial number). So, currently, there are 10 people on the bus (initial number + additional people). Therefore, the correct answer is 10.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 people in the train and then 8 more got on board. So, the total number of passengers now is:  Initially: 11 + Newly arrived: 8 = Total: 19 people are currently in the train.;
Response:  We know that 22 parents participated in the program and 676 people in total took part in it. To find out how many students were involved, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants. Therefore, the number of students who participated in the program is:  Number of students = Total number of participants - Number of parents  = 676 - 22  = 654 students.;
"Response:  We know that there are 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. So, we can write an equation as follows: Parents + Students = Total number of people in the program.  Now let's solve for ""Total number of people in the program"":  Total number of people in the program = Number of parents + Number of students  Total number of people in the program = 73 + 724  Total number of people in the program = 801  Therefore, there were 801 people present at the program.";
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in the program. To find out how many students were present with their parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students present = Total number of participants - Number of parents  Number of students present = 521 - 174  Number of students present = 347 Therefore, there were 347 students present at the program with their parents.;
Response:  We know that there are 61 parents and 177 students participating in the program. The program can accommodate 44 people at most. Therefore, we need to find out how many people were present beyond the capacity of the program. To do this, we divide the total number of participants (61 + 177 = 238) by the maximum capacity of the program (44): Number of people present beyond capacity = Total number of participants - Maximum capacity of the program = 238 - 44 = 194 So, there were 194 people present at the program beyond its capacity.;
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is: Distance = 1307 - 919 = 388 feet. Therefore, the end of the cave is 388 feet away from the entrance.;
Response:  The distance from the starting point to the bottom of the barlang is given as $d = 1218$ meters.  We are told that they have already descended $h = 849$ meters, so the remaining distance to the bottom is $d - h = 369$ meters.  Since they are traveling at a constant speed of $v = 17$ meters per second, it will take them time $t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{369}{17} = 21$ seconds to reach the bottom of the barlang.;
Response:  The distance from the entrance to the bottom of the cave is 762 - 659 = 133 feet (or 40 meters). So, if they are currently at 659 feet above sea level and want to reach the end of the cave, it will take them approximately 133 / 6 = 22 minutes to get there.;
Response:  The total number of goldfish = 8 (Paige raised) + 6 (kobor macskák left) = 14. So, 14 - 8 = 6 goldfish disappeared.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 golden fish and 12 herring in the pond. If the cats liked to eat them, then some of the fish must have disappeared. Now there are only 15 left. So, we can calculate the number of missing fish as follows: Number of missing fish = Total initial fish - Number of remaining fish = 7 + 12 - 15 = 4 Therefore, 4 fish have disappeared.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 goldfish and 71 cats in the pond. The cats liked to eat the goldfish. Now, only two goldfish are left. So, we can calculate the number of goldfish that disappeared as follows: Number of goldfish that disappeared = Total initial goldfish - Number of remaining goldfish = 16 - 2 = 14 Therefore, 14 goldfish have disappeared.;
"Response:  We know that there were initially 15 goldfish in the pond and 5 of them were eaten by the cats. So, we have:

Goldfish remaining = Initial number - Number eaten
= 15 - 5
= 10

Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.";
"Response:  Initially, the chef had 43 almonds. After you took one small bite, he was left with 42 almonds. So, the number of almonds that you have taken is 1 (since you mentioned ""a small bite""). Therefore, the final number of almonds that the chef has is 42 - 1 = 41 almonds.";
Response:  If the chef had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make a small pie, then how many apples are left?  We can start by subtracting the number of apples used from the total number of apples the chef had: 58 - 35 = 23. So, there were 23 apples left after the chef made the small pie.;
Response:  We know that at first, the chef had 40 almonds and 54 walnuts. After he cooked a small piece of pie, he had 39 left. So, we can calculate how many almonds were used as follows: Number of almonds used = Total number of almonds - Number of almonds after cooking = 40 - 39 = 1 Therefore, the chef used 1 almond to make the pie.;
Response:  We know that Adam has 11 action figures and there are 4 shelves in his room. Since each shelf can hold 4 action figures, we have: Number of action figures that can be placed on the shelves = 11 / 4 = 2.75 action figures per shelf. As there are 4 shelves in total, we can place up to 2.75 x 4 = 11 action figures on the shelves. Therefore, the number of action figures that Adam can place in his room is 11.;
Response:  We know that Adam can place 10 action figures in his room and he wants to keep 8 of them there. So, we need to find out how many polls are available for him to store these 8 action figures.  Since there are 10 action figures in total, and Adam wants to keep 8 of them, then the number of poles available is: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, there were two poles available in Adam's room.;
"Response:  We know that there are 8 action figures and 10 boxes in Adam's room. Since each box can hold up to 4 items, we have:

Number of items per box = 4 (since each box can hold up to 4 items)
Total number of items = Number of boxes x Items per box
= 10 (boxes) x 4 (items per box)
= 40 items

So, Adam could place 40 items on his shelves.";
Response:  We know that there are 544 flower pots in total and each pot contains 32 flowers. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot Total number of flowers = 544 x 32 Total number of flowers = 17680 Now, we have to find out how many flowers are there altogether. To do this, we divide the total number of flowers by 10 (the number of gardens). Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of flowers = 17680 / 10 = 1768 Finally, the answer is 1768 flowers.;
Response:  We know that there are 466 cups and each cup contains 53 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is: 466 x 53 = 24,978 flowers. Similarly, we know that there are 181 bots in each cup, so the total number of bots is: 466 x 181 = 86,066 bots. Therefore, the total number of flowers and bots together is: 24,978 + 86,066 = 111,044.;
Response:  We know that there are 141 cups and each cup contains 71 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is: 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. Therefore, there are 9671 flowers in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in each dish and we have 4 dishes in total. So, the number of flowers in all the dishes together is 4 x 40 = 160 flowers. Therefore, the number of plates required to hold all the flowers is 160 / 40 = 4 plates.;
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4276 wrappers. If we divide the number of Skittles by the number of wrappers, we get: Number of groups = Total number of Skittles / Total number of wrappers = 4502 / 4276 = 10.39 groups So, there are approximately 10.39 groups of 154 Skittles each in Steven's collection.;
"Response:  We know that there are 4950 tokens in Steven's collection and he has 3941 skittles. So, we have:

Number of skittles = 3941
Total number of tokens = 4950
Now, let's divide the total number of tokens into groups of 495 each:

Number of groups = Total number of tokens / Number of tokens per group
= 4950 / 495
= 10
So, there are 10 groups of 495 tokens each.";
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 517 gum wrappers. If we divide the number of Skittles by the number of gum wrappers, we get: Number of Skittles per gum wrapper = 896 / 517 = 1.72 Skittles per gum wrapper Now, let's assume that the Skittles are divided into 8 groups (based on the question). Since each group contains an equal number of Skittles, we can say that the number of Skittles in each group is also equal to 1.72 Skittles per gum wrapper. Therefore, the number of Skittles in each group is: Number of Skittles in each group = 1.72 x 8 = 13.44 Skittles So, there are 13 Skittles in each group.;
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of classes = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in school and each class has 75 students. So, we need to calculate how many students are in all of these classes together. To do this, we can multiply the number of classes (304) by the number of students per class (75): 304 x 75 = 22,600 Students Total. Therefore, there are 22,600 students in total at the school.;
