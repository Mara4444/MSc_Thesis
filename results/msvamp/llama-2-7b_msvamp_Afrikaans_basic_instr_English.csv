"Response: 1054 T-shirts
Explanation: According to the question, Razorback T-shirts sell for $23 each and during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game they sold $230 worth of T-shirts. To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can divide the amount earned ($230) by the price of one T-shirt ($23): 230 / 23 = 1054 T-shirts."
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $17 dollars ($51 divided by 3).
Response:  The Razorbacks made $3690 from selling 95 T-shirts during both games combined. During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 T-shirts and made $1825 in revenue. Therefore, the amount of money the Razorbacks made per T-shirt sold is:  $1825 / 47 = $39 dollars per T-shirt.
"Response: 115
Explanation: According to the passage, during both the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 242 T-shirts. Since they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can conclude that they sold 127 T-shirts (242 - 115) during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  $89 x $98 = $87,520 
"Response: 
The amount of money made by selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game can be calculated as follows:
During the Arkansas game, they sold 186 T-shirts and made $78 per shirt, so the total amount of money made was:
$78 x 186 = $149,050
During the Texas Tech game, they sold 172 T-shirts and made $78 per shirt, so the total amount of money made was:
$78 x 172 = $130,640
Therefore, the total amount of money made from selling T-shirts during both games was:
$149,050 + $130,640 = $279,690"
Response:  The Razorbacks made $104 in profit from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. They sold 183 t-shirts at $62 each and 31 truis at $99 each.
"Response: 
The amount of money made by selling trousers can be calculated as follows:
$165 x 156 = $25,940
Therefore, the Razorbacks made $25,940 from selling trousers during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response: 
The number of T-shirts sold by Razorback is $ 192 x 157 = $ 28,606.
The number of shirts sold by Razorback is more than the number of shirts sold by Tech by $ 28,606 - $ 19 = $ 28,587."
"Response: 170
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Arkansas sold 254 T-shirts and Texas Tech sold 43 truis. Therefore, the difference between the number of truis sold by Arkansas and Texas Tech is 211 (254 - 43). Since each trui costs $232, the total revenue generated from selling truis is $49,620 ($232 x 211). On the other hand, each T-shirt costs $86, so the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts is $20,768 ($86 x 254).

"Response: 
Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies given to his 11 friends. To find out how many crackers each person got, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of people. So, the answer is: Each person got 22/11 = 19 crackers."
Response: 29/3 = 9.67 (approximately)
"Response: 
Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies eaten by his 7 friends. To find out how many crackers and cookies each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cookies that Matthew had by the number of people who ate them.
Crackers: 14 / 7 = 2
Cookies: 21 / 7 = 3
Therefore, each person ate 2 crackers and 3 cookies."
Response: 2 (the number of friends) / 18 (the total number of crackers) = 0.11 (the number of crackers each person ate).
"Response: 36 / 6 = 6
Therefore, Matthew gave crackers to 6 friends."
Response: 5 krakers each friend (5 x 2 = 10)
Response: 23
"Response: 
Each person ate an equal number of crackers and cookies. Therefore, if Matthew had given 32 crackers to his 4 friends, each friend would have received 8 crackers (32 / 4 = 8). Similarly, if he had given 98 cookies to his 4 friends, each friend would have received 24.5 cookies (98 / 4 = 24.5)."
Response: 25 koekies and 64 crackers were given to each of Matthews four friends. Therefore, in total, Matthews friends had eaten 25 + 25 = 50 koekies and 8 x 4 = 32 crackers.
"Response: 
To find out how many crackers and cookies each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cookies by the number of people who shared them.

Total number of crackers = 28 (as given in the question)
Total number of cookies = 28 (as given in the question)
Number of people sharing = 28 (as given in the question)

Therefore, each person ate:
Crackers: 28 / 28 = 1
Cookies: 28 / 28 = 1
So, each person ate one cracker and one cookie."
Response: 15683 bottles (Debbie bought 2 bottles and drank 109 bottles per day for 74 days)
Response: 153 / 17 = 9
Response: 109 (Debbie still has 109 water bottles left)
Response: 28 days (157 bottles / 6 bottles per day = 28 days)
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: If Debbie drank 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles per day, she would have consumed a total of 88 + 13 = 101 bottles in one day. To find out how many days it would take for her to consume all 88 water bottles, we can divide the number of bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day: 101 / 4 = 25.25 days. Since you cannot have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 26 days. However, since Debbie already had 88 water bottles when she started drinking them, we subtract that amount from the total number of days: 26 - 88 = -62 days. Therefore, Debbie would have held onto those water bottles for approximately 62 days before finishing them all."
"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the question, Debbie drank 312 water bottles and 256 soda bottles over a period of time when she was at an off-license (a place where alcoholic beverages are sold). If she drank 4 soda bottles per day, it means that she consumed 4 x 10 = 40 soda bottles per week. Since she had 256 soda bottles initially, this means that she would have used up all of them after 40/256 = 10 weeks. Therefore, the answer is 10 days."
Response: 720 Rand (approximately $54 USD)
"Response: 23 days
Explanation: To find out how many days the water bottles will last, we need to divide the number of water bottles by the number of water bottles consumed per day. In this case, Debbie drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles per day, so she used up 79 water bottles (15 x 5 = 75 + 5 x 4 = 20). Therefore, if it took her 23 days to consume 79 water bottles, it means that one water bottle will last for approximately 3.36 days (79 / 23 = 3.36)."

Response: 84 x 95 = 8020 students.
"Response: 10 school buses are needed to transport all the learners for the field trip.
Explanation:
The number of learner groups (klaskamers) at the school = 66 x 6 = 396 learners.
Since each group has 6 learners per classroom, there will be 396 / 6 = 66 learner groups or classes going on the field trip.
Therefore, 66 x 6 = 408 learners need to be transported by school bus. Since there are only 6 seats available on each bus, we need 408 / 6 = 10 school buses to accommodate all the learners."
"Response: 16 school buses are needed to transport all learners for the field trip. 
Explanation: The number of learner groups (klaskamers) that can fit in each classroom is given by 58 learners / 87 classrooms = 0.66 or approximately 3/5 of a full classroom. Since there are 2 seat rows per bus, we need 3/5 x 16 = 16 buses to accommodate all learners for the field trip."
Response: 5 students per classroom (or 60 students total).
Response: 4 buses are needed to transport all the students for the field trip. Since there are 102 students and 8 seats per bus, 4 buses will accommodate all the students. Therefore, the answer is 4 buses.
Response: 33 students will go on the field trip. There are 11 students in the school and 99 seats available per bus, so 8 students do not want to go on the trip, leaving 33 students who will go on the trip.
Response: 4 school buses are needed to transport all 111 students for the field trip.
Response: 5 students per seat = 92 students / 46 buses = 2 seats per bus.

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Emily made 20 necklaces for her friends and she could make 32 necklaces using the 2 karat gold she had. Therefore, each necklace required 1.67 grams of gold (32 / 20). Since there are 1000 milligrams in 1 gram, we can convert this amount to grams by dividing it by 1000: 1.67 g / 1000 = 0.167 g. Since there are 4 grams in 1 karat, we can divide the total amount of gold needed for all the necklaces by 4 to find out how many karats were needed: 0.167 g / 4 = 0.04175 karats. So, each necklace required approximately 0.04175 karats of gold."
