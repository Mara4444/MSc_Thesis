Response:  Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. So, she played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 8 (18 - 10).
Response:  Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Tuesday and Monday is 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Julia played with more children in Tuesday than in Monday by 1 child.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 7 more children on Tuesday. So, in total she played with 5 + 7 = 12 children.
Response:  Julia played with some children on Monday and in Tuesday she played with 14 children. So, if she played with a total of 16 children, then she must have played with 2 more children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played with 10 children on Monday (Monday - Tuesday = 2).
Response:  If Julia played with more than 12 children in Monday than she did in Tuesday, then we can say that she played with at least 12 + x children in Tuesday, where x is the number of children she played with in Monday minus the number of children she played with in Tuesday. So, if Julia played with 16 children in Monday and 12 children in Tuesday, then she played with 4 children (16 - 12) in Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played with 4 children in Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and more than eight children on Monday (the day before), then she played with at least 8 + x children on Monday, where x is the number of additional children she played with compared to Tuesday. Since she played with 14 children on Tuesday, we can set up the equation: 8 + x = 14. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (понеделник), Julia played with 17 children.  On Tuesday (вторник), she played with 15 children.  On Wednesday (сряда), she played with only 2 children. So, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children in Monday and 18 children in Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 33 children (15 + 18). Now, we are asked how many children she played with in Monday and Tuesday together. Therefore, the answer is 33.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children in Monday and 9 children in Tuesday. So, she played with 5 + 9 = 14 children in total between Monday and Tuesday. Now, we are asked how many children she played with in Monday and Saturday. Since she played with 15 children in Saturday, the number of children she played with in Monday is 14 - 15 = -1. Therefore, Julia did not play with any children in Monday.
Response:  Julia played with 2 children on Monday (понеделник), 14 children on Tuesday (вторник), and 16 children on Wednesday (сряда). So, she played with 14 + 16 = 30 children in total between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 9 children in Monday and 7 children in Tuesday. So, she played with more children in Monday than in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is: 9 - 7 = 2. So, Julia played with 2 fewer children in Tuesday than in Monday.
Response:  Julia played with 14 children in Monday and 2 children in Tuesday. So, she played with 16 children in total (14 + 2). Now, we are asked how many children she played with in Monday compared to Saturday. To find this out, we need to divide the number of children she played with in Monday by the number of children she played with in Saturday: 16 / 8 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with twice as many children in Monday than in Saturday.
Response:  On Monday (понеделник), Julia played with 8 children.  On Tuesday (вторник), she played with 11 children.  On Wednesday (сряда), she played with 9 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children in Tuesday than in Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Tuesday and Wednesday is 2 (11 - 9 = 2).
Response:  Julia played with 15 children in Monday and 18 children in Tuesday. So, she played with 33 children in total (15 + 18). Now, we need to find out how many children she played with in Wednesday. According to the question, she played with 7 children in Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she played with in Monday and Wednesday is 33 - 7 = 26.
Response:  On Monday (понеделник), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (вторник), she played with 10 children. And on Thursday (сряда), she played cards with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  Julia played with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 20 children (7 + 13 = 20). Therefore, she played with 20 children on Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing tag with both groups of children. So, if we divide the total time (34 hours) by the number of children she played with on each day (12 + 14 = 26), we get: Time per child = 34/26 = 1.308 hours. Therefore, Julia played with 13 children (since there are 12 hours in a day).
Response:  Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, she spent a total of 38 hours playing tag with both groups combined. To find out how many children she played with in each day, we can divide the total time by the number of days: 38 hours / 2 days = 19 hours per day. Therefore, Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 5 children on Wednesday and 6 children on Monday. So, in total, she played with 11 children (5 + 6). Therefore, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Wednesday is 5 - 5 = 0.
Response:  Julia played with 4 children on Monday and with several more on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 18 children. Therefore, she played with 6 children on Tuesday (18 - 4 = 6).
Response:  Julia played with 6 children in Monday and 4 children in Tuesday. So, she played with more children in Monday than in Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with in Monday and Tuesday is 6 - 4 = 2. So, Julia played with 2 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
Response:  Bob has eaten some bonbons and then he has eaten another 25. So, in total, Bob has eaten 43 pieces of bonbons (initial + additional). Therefore, the number of pieces of bonbons that Bob initially had is:  Initial = Total - Additional = 43 - 25 = 18.
"Response: 
Bobby has already eaten 28 pieces of bonbon and then he ate another 42 pieces. So in total, Bobby has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of bonbon. 
Now, we are told that Bob also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to 5 pieces of bonbon, Bob has eaten 63 / 5 = 12.6 pieces of bonbon (since you can't eat a fraction of a piece).  Therefore, the final number of bonbons that Bobby has eaten is 70 - 12.6 = 57.4 pieces of bonbon."
Response:  Bob has eaten 33 pieces of bonbon and then he ate another 4 pieces. So, in total, Bob has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of bonbon. Additionally, Bob has also eaten 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final answer is:  Number of bonbons eaten by Bob = 37 Number of chocolates eaten by Bob = 14
Response:  Bob has eaten 38 bonbons and then eaten another 36. So he has eaten in total 74 bonbons (38 + 36). Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the number of bonbons that Bob has eaten more than the number of pieces of chocolate is:  74 - 16 = 58. So, Bob has eaten 58 more bonbons than pieces of chocolate.
Response:  Bobby took 20 bonbons and ate 34 pieces of them. After that, he ate another 18 pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 52 pieces of bonbons (20 + 34 + 18).
Response:  Bob had initially 21 bonbons. He ate 5 of them, so he has 21 - 5 = 16 bonbons left. Then, he ate another 9, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 bonbons left. Therefore, Bob has 7 bonbons remaining.
Response:  At first, Bob had 22 pieces of bonbons. If he ate some, then he had less than 22 pieces. After that, he ate another 5 pieces, so now he has even fewer pieces. To find out how many pieces he had at the beginning, we need to subtract the number of pieces he ate from the initial amount: 22 - (some he ate) = 8. So, Bob ate 14 pieces of bonbons initially.
Response:  Bob had 19 pieces of bonbons and he took out 2 pieces. So, how many pieces does he have left? We can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of bonboni Bob has = 19 - 2 = 17 Now we know that Bob has 17 pieces of bonbons left.
Response:  At first, Bob had 32 pieces of bonbonies. If he ate several pieces, then he has less than 32 pieces now. We don't know exactly how many pieces he ate, but we can assume that he ate at least one piece because otherwise he would have none left. So, let's say he ate x pieces of bonbons. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left for him after eating x pieces. The total number of pieces is still 32, so if he ate x pieces, then there are 32 - x pieces left. Since he has 20 pieces left, we can set up the equation: 32 = 20 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 12. Therefore, Bob ate 12 pieces of bonbons. So, he has 20 pieces left.
Response:  Bob initially had 36 bonbons and he ate 17 of them. So, after eating 17 bonbons, he has 36 - 17 = 19 bonbons left. Then, he ate another 15 bonbons, so now he has 19 - 15 = 4 bonbons left. Therefore, Bob has 4 bonbons left.
Response:  Bob initially had 30 bonbons and he ate 23 of them. So, if we subtract the number of bonbons he ate (23) from the initial amount he had (30), we get: 30 - 23 = 7. Therefore, Bob has 7 remaining bonbons.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 5 balloons and Jack brought 3 balloons to the park. So, in total, we have 5 + 3 = 8 balloons at the park. Therefore, Alan has more balloons than Jack at the park.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and Jack brought 3 balloons to the park. So, in total, we have 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park. Therefore, Jack has 3 more balloons than Alan at the park.
Response:  If Alan has brought 2 balloons to the park and Jack has also brought some number of balloons (let's call it x), then together they have brought 2 + x balloons to the park. So, the answer is 2 + x.
Response:  We know that Jake has brought 6 balloons to the park and Alan has brought x balloons. Since Jake has brought more than the number of balloons that Alan has brought, we can say that Jake has brought 6 > x. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this inequality. To do this, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 6 : 6 > x  Divide both sides by 6 : x < 10 Therefore, the answer is x = 10. So, Alan has brought 10 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jack brought more than 6 balloons (but not equal to) the number of balloons that Alan brought, then we can say that Jack brought x balloons where x is greater than 6 but less than or equal to 11 (since there are only 11 - 6 = 5 balloons in total). So, the correct answer is x = 9. Therefore, Jack brought 9 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan brings 3 balloons and Jack brings 5 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons. Then, Alan buys two more balloons in the park, so now he has 2 + 8 = 10 balloons. Similarly, Jack also buys two more balloons after that, so now he has 5 + 2 = 7 balloons. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Alan and Jack had in the park is 10 (Alan) + 7 (Jack) = 17 balloons.
Response:  Firstly, Alan brings 2 balloons and Jack brings 4 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 6 balloons (2 + 4). Then, Alan buys more 3 balloons in the park. Therefore, now they have 9 balloons in total (6 + 3). So, compared to Jack, Alan has 3 more balloons in the park (9 - 6 = 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan brought 2 balloons and Jack brought 6 balloons to the park. So, in total, they had 8 balloons (2 + 6). Then, Alan bought more balloons in the park, which means he added 3 more balloons to the total number of balloons they already had. Therefore, the final answer is: 8 + 3 = 11. So, Jack has 11 balloons more than Alan in the park.
"Response: 
1. Alan brings 5 balloons and Jack brings 4 balloons to the park. So together they have 9 balloons (5 + 4).
2. Then, Alan buys additional 3 balloons in the park. Now he has 12 balloons (9 + 3).
Therefore, the number of balloons brought or purchased by Alan in the park is 12."
"Response: 

Alan brings 6 balloons to the park and Jack brings 2 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 8 balloons (6 + 2).
Then, Jack buys additional 3 balloons in the park, so now he has 5 balloons (2 + 3).
Now, let's compare how many balloons Alan and Jack have in the park:
Alan has 6 balloons, and Jack has 5 balloons, so Alan has more balloons than Jack in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 1 (6 - 5 = 1). Therefore, the correct answer is 1."
Response:  Firstly, Alan brings 6 balloons to the park and Jack brings 3 more balloons from outside the park. So, in total, they have 9 balloons (6 + 3). Now, Jack buys additional 4 balloons inside the park. Therefore, the final number of balloons that Jack has is 13 (9 + 4). So, the difference between the number of balloons that Jack has and the number of balloons that Alan has is 4 (13 - 9).
Response:  Firstly, Alan brought 5 balloons to the park and then Jack bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Jack brought to the park is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Jack brought 8 balloons to the park.
"Response: 
From what we know from the problem statement:
* Alan brought 3 balloons and 20 toys to the park.
* Jack brought 5 balloons and 59 toys to the park.
So, in total, they brought:
Balloons: 3 + 5 = 8
Toys: 20 + 59 = 79
Therefore, the number of balloons that Alan and Jack had in the park together is 8."
Response:  We know that Alan brought 7 balloons and 5 toy cars to the park. Therefore, he had a total of 7 + 5 = 12 items in the park. Similarly, we know that Jack brought 6 balloons and 4 toy cars to the park. So, he had a total of 6 + 4 = 10 items in the park. Now, we need to find out how many toy cars both of them have together. Since Alan has 12 items and Jack has 10 items, their combined total is 12 + 10 = 22 toy cars. Therefore, the answer is 22.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons and Jack brought 1 balloon, then together they brought 5 + 1 = 6 balloons to the park. So, Jack brought 6 - 5 = 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 2 balloons to the park and bought 3 more there. So, in total, Alan has 5 balloons (2 + 3) in the park. Now, we are told that Jack brought 6 balloons to the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons brought by Jack and the number of balloons brought by Alan is 6 - 5 = 1. So, Jack had 1 more balloon than Alan in the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese per day. To find out how many more hours he spent studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying both languages. So, in this case, the difference is: $6 - 2 = 4$ hours. Therefore, Ryan has spent $4$ more hours studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese per day. So he has studied English for 6 hours x 24 days = 144 hours in total. He has also studied Chinese for 7 hours x 24 days = 168 hours in total. Therefore, Ryan has spent more time studying Chinese than English, which is 168 - 144 = 24 hours more.
"Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and another few hours studying Chinese every day. So far, he has spent a total of x hours studying Chinese. Since he spends 4 hours studying both languages each day, we can set up the following equation:

x + (3 \* x) = 4(n)

where n is the number of days he has been studying. Solving for x, we get:

x = 28

So Ryan spends 28 hours studying Chinese every week."
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and X hours studying Chinese. If he spends 2 more hours studying English than he does Chinese, then he spends X - 2 hours studying Chinese. So, Ryan spends 5 hours (X - 2) studying Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and X hours studying English. If he spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, then he spends X + 2 hours studying English. So, Ryan spends 5 + 2 = 7 hours studying English.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese per day. If he studies for 5 days, then:  English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours  Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours So, in total, Ryan will spend 30 hours studying English and 35 hours studying Chinese.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese per day. If he studies for 2 days, then he will spend a total of:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours studying English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours studying Chinese
Therefore, in total, Ryan will spend 22 hours studying English and 10 hours studying Chinese over two days."
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Chinese per day. If he studies for 6 days, then: Total time spent studying English = 5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours Total time spent studying Chinese = 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours So, in total, Ryan will spend 30 + 24 = 54 hours studying Chinese over the course of 6 days.
"Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English and 6 hours studying Chinese per day. To find out how many hours he studies in total each day, we can multiply his daily study time for each language by the number of days he has to study:

English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours (studying English)
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 502 hours (studying Chinese)
So, in total, Ryan studies English for 352 hours and Chinese for 502 hours over the course of 86 days."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day. Therefore, he studies English for 6/24 = 1/4 of his total daily time. Similarly, he studies Chinese and Spanish for 7/24 = 1/8 and 3/24 = 1/8 of his total daily time respectively. So, he studies English for 1 hour, Chinese for 0.75 hours (or 75 minutes), and Spanish for 0.75 hours (or 75 minutes).
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he has studied English for a total of 6 x 24 = 144 hours in one week.  He also studies Chinese for 3 hours per day, which means he has studied Chinese for a total of 3 x 24 = 72 hours in one week. Finally, he studies Spanish for 58 hours per week. So, the difference between the time he spends studying English and the time he spends studying Chinese is: 144 - 72 = 72 hours. Therefore, Ryan has spent more time studying English than he has studying Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying every day. He spends 2 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Spanish. So he has studied English for 7 \* 2 = 14 hours and Spanish for 7 \* 4 = 28 hours. Therefore, Ryan has spent more time studying English than Spanish. The difference in hours is 28 - 14 = 14 hours.
"Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day studying English, 5 hours per day studying Chinese, and 4 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spent studying Chinese than Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Spanish from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, if we do this calculation, we get:

Hours studied Chinese - Hours studied Spanish = 5 hours - 4 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Ryan has spent 1 hour more studying Chinese than Spanish."
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and Chinese every day. If he spends 2 hours studying English each day, then he spends x hours studying Chinese. Since the total time spent studying is 3 hours, we can set up the equation: 2x = 3. Solving for x, we get:  x = 1.5 hours. So, Ryan spends 1.5 hours studying Chinese every day.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese each day. Therefore, he studies for a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours in English and 5 x 7 = 35 hours in Chinese. So, Ryan studies a total of 28 + 35 = 63 hours over 7 days.
Response:  On Monday, Tifani collected 8 boxes of canned food. If she found additional 7 boxes on Tuesday, then the total number of boxes collected is: 8 + 7 = 15. Therefore, there were 7 more boxes of canned food collected on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tifani collected 7 boxes of canned food. If she found additional 12 boxes on Tuesday, then the total number of boxes collected is: 7 + 12 = 19. Therefore, Tifani found 13 more boxes of canned food on Tuesday than she had on Monday.
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 4 boxes of canned food. If she found more boxes on Tuesday, let's say x. Then, we know that the total number of boxes is 6 (Monday + Tuesday). So, the ratio of boxes found on Tuesday to those found on Monday is:
x/4 =..."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected some boxes for recycling. There were several trash cans with food waste. If she had altogether 8 chants, and there were additional 4 trash cans with food waste on the next day, how many chants did she have in total on Monday? So, the answer is 8 + 4 = 12 chants.
"Response:  On Monday, Tifani collected 10 boxes of recyclables. If she found 3 more boxes on Tuesday and 7 more boxes on Wednesday, then... See full solution

Answer:  Let's think step by step.
On Monday, Tifani collected 10 boxes of recyclables. If she found 3 more boxes on Tuesday and 7 more boxes on Wednesday, then the total number of boxes she collected is:

10 + 3 = 13 boxes on Monday
13 + 7 = 20 boxes on Wednesday

Therefore, Tifani collected a total of 20 boxes of recyclables."
Response:  On Monday (понеделник), Tiphani collected 8 boxes of recyclables. If she found 10 more boxes on Tuesday and 4 more boxes on Wednesday, then...  Total number of boxes = 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 boxes. Therefore, Tiphani had collected 22 boxes of recyclables after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tifani collected 3 boxes of canned food. If we assume that each box contains the same number of cans, then Tifani collected 3 x 12 = 36 cans on Monday.  Then, on Tuesday, she found additional 7 boxes of canned food, which means she collected 7 x 12 = 84 more cans. Therefore, in total, Tifani collected 36 + 84 = 120 cans of canned food.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red beans and 16 green beans in the bag. To find out how many more red beans there are, we can subtract the number of green beans from the total number of beans: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red bean in the bag than green beans.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red beans and 11 green beans in total. So, if we divide the number of green beans (11) by the number of red beans (5), we get:  Number of green beans = 11 / 5 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 green beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red beads in the box and some additional green beads. If we assume that all the beads are equally distributed in the box, then the number of green beads is equal to the total number of beads minus the number of red beads. So, if there are 10 red beads and 3 additional green beads (as given), then the number of green beads in the box is 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 green beads in the box.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red beans in the basket and more than 10 green beans. So, if we have x green beans, then we must have 3x - 10 green beans. Since there are no negative numbers of green beans, we can conclude that x = 20. Therefore, there are 20 green beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red prunes in the basket and 3 times as many yellow prunes (i.e., 3 x 15 = 45). Therefore, the total number of prunes in the basket is 7 + 45 = 52. So, there are 52 prunes in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red prunes in the basket, and each red prune has 7 yellow prunes associated with it. Therefore, the total number of yellow prunes is 7 x 7 = 49. Since there are 8 green prunes in the basket, we can conclude that there are 49 - 8 = 41 green prunes in the basket. So, there are 41 green prunes in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 2 red prunes in the basket and 6 yellow ones. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 2 + 6 = 8. Now, let's see how many green prunes there are. According to the question, there are 14 green prunes in the basket. Therefore, the number of green prunes is 14. So, the final answer is 8 (red) + 14 (green) = 22.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red prunes in the basket and 11 yellow ones. To find out how many more red prunes than yellow ones there are, we need to subtract their numbers: 19 - 11 = 8. So, there are 8 more red prunes than yellow ones in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red prunes in the basket and 90 yellow ones. So, we have: 6 + 90 = 96 prawns in total. Now, let's find out how many green prunes there are: 16 x (number of yellow prunes) = 16 x 90 = 1440 green prunes. Therefore, there are 96 red prunes and 1440 green prunes in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red prunes in the basket and 14 yellow ones. So, we have:

Red prunes = 18
Yellow prunes = 14

Now, let's find out how many yellow prunes are in the basket:

Number of yellow prunes = Total number of prunes - Number of red prunes
= 14 + 18
= 32

So, there are 32 yellow prunes in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red prunes in the basket, and each red prune has 3 green, yellow, or blue prunes inside it. So, we can say that the total number of green, yellow, and blue prunes in the basket is equal to 5 x 3 = 15. Since there are no blue prunes in the basket, we can conclude that there are 15 yellow prunes in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  We know that there are 65 kennels with rabbits. Since each kennel has either red or green carrots, we can say that the total number of red and green carrots is equal to 65 x 8 = 520. So, there are 520 red carrots and 520 green carrots in all the kennels together. Therefore, there are 7 red prawns and 3 green prawns in every kennel. Thus, the total number of prawns in all the kennels is 7 x 65 = 455 and 3 x 65 = 195 respectively.
Response:  We have 11 coops with chickens. Each coop has 10 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So, in total we have: 10 x 11 = 110 red peppers 18 x 11 = 208 green peppers Therefore, there are 110 + 208 = 318 peppers in all 11 coops.
Response:  We know that there are 6 coops with chickens. Each coop has 16 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of red peppers = 6 x 16 = 96 Number of green peppers = 6 x 18 = 108 Now, let's find out how many red peppers each coop has: Red pepper count per coop = Total number of red peppers / Number of coops = 96 / 6 = 16 Therefore, each coop has 16 red peppers.
Response:  We know that there are 7 coops with chickens. Each coop has 10 red peppers and 2 green peppers. So, we can write this information as an equation: 7C + 2 = 10R + 2G Where C is the number of coops, R is the number of red peppers in each coop, and G is the number of green peppers in each coop. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: 7(x) + 2 = 10(5) + 2(2) x = 70 + 4 x = 74 Therefore, there are 74 green peppers in total.
Response:  We know that there are several nest boxes with pigeons. Each nest box has 4 red pigeons and 3 green pigeons. If there are altogether 7 pigeons in all the nest boxes, then how many nest boxes with pigeons do we have?  Therefore, the number of nest boxes with pigeons is 7 / 4 = 1 1/2.
Response:  We know that there are two coats with rabbits and each coat has 4 red carrots and some green ones. So, in total, we have:  Red carrots: 8 (4 x 2) Green carrots:? Total number of carrots: 10 (8 +?). Since there are 12 carrots in all, we can conclude that the number of green carrots in each coat is:  Green carrots: 2 (10 - 8).
Response:  We know that there are 16 prunes in total and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green prunes is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green prunes in the basket.
Response:  We know that every cooshinka has 19 red and 4 green pruskvi. If there are 15 such cooshinkas, then we can calculate the total number of pruskvi as follows: Total number of red pruskvi = 19 x 15 = 285Total number of green pruskvi = 4 x 15 = 60So, in total, there are 285 + 60 = 345 pruskvi in the 15 cooshinkas.
Response:  We have 10 prskovies in total and they are distributed equally among several baskets. Since each basket has 4 red prskovies and 6 green prskovies, we can calculate the number of baskets as follows: Number of baskets = Total number of prskovies / (Number of red prskovies per basket x Number of green prskovies per basket) = 10 / (4 x 6) = 20 So there are 20 baskets in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green prunes in the basket and 30 yellow ones (6 + 30 = 36). Since we also have 2 red prunes, this means that there are 36 - 2 = 34 prunes in total in the basket. Therefore, there are 34 green prunes in the basket.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added more action figures to the shelves. If there are now 8 action figures in total on the shelves, then we can conclude that Jerry must have added 4 additional action figures (since there were already 4 on the shelf). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures on his shelves. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the same shelves. So, how many action figures did Jerry have initially on the shelves?  We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let X be the number of action figures Jerry had initially on the shelves. Then we know that the total number of action figures Jerry has now is X + 7. Since there are 10 action figures in total, we can set up the equation: X + 7 = 10. Solving for X, we get: X = 3. Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures initially on the shelves.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelves initially. Later, he added another 6 action figures to the shelves. So, in total, Jerry has 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on his shelves now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on shelves in his room. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the shelves. So, initially, there were 5 + 9 = 14 items on the shelves. After adding more action figures, the total number of items on the shelves became 14 + 7 = 21. Therefore, Jerry has 21 action figures on his shelves now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures in his room. Later, he added another 4 action figures to the shelves. So, initially, there were 10 + 2 = 12 items in total. After that, he added 4 more action figures, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 items in total. Therefore, the number of books is still 10, but the number of action figures has increased from 2 to 16.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 excitement figures and 9 books on shelves in his room. Later, he added another 10 books to the shelf. So, how many books did Jerry have on the shelf after adding more?  We can calculate this as follows:  Initially, Jerry had 8 + 9 = 17 books on the shelf.  Then, he added another 10 books, so the total number of books on the shelf now is 17 + 10 = 27 books. Therefore, Jerry had 27 books on the shelf after adding more.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on shelves in his room. Later, he added another 4 books to the shelves. So, now Jerry has 7 + 4 = 11 action figures and 2 books on shelves. Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry has more than books is 11 - 2 = 9.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on shelves in his room. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelves. So, initially, there were 5 + 2 = 7 items on the shelves. After that, there were 7 + 9 = 16 items on the shelves in total. Therefore, Jerry has 16 more books than action figures on the shelves.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, how many action figures does Jerry have on his shelf now?  We can use the information given in the question to calculate this:  Number of new action figures = 4 Old action figures removed = 5 Total number of action figures = New + Old = 4 + 5 = 9 Therefore, Jerry has 9 action figures on his shelf now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 4 more and removed some of the old ones. If there are now 6 action figures on the shelf, that means Jerry has taken out 3 - 4 = 1 figure from the original 3. So, Jerry took out 1 action figure from the original 3.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his room. Then he added some more and removed 10 of the old ones. So, if he has 8 action figures now, that means he must have added 3 new ones (since 8 - 7 = 3).
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures on his shelves. Later, he added 2 more action figures and removed 7 of the old ones from the shelves. Now, if there are 10 action figures on Jerry's shelves, how many did he have initially on the shelves?  We can deduce that Jerry had 3 action figures initially on his shelves (the number he had before adding any new ones).
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures in his room. Then he added another 7 action figures to the shelves. If there are also 10 books on one of the shelves, how many more action figures does Jerry have than books?  Therefore, the number of action figures is greater than the number of books by 9 (the initial amount) plus 7 (the additional amount). So, the answer is 9 + 7 = 16.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another 2 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 5 action figures now (3 + 2 = 5). Therefore, the number of action figures Jerry has is equal to the number of books he had initially, which is 3.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another 2 action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there are:

* Books: 7 + 2 = 9
* Action figures: 3 + 2 = 5

Therefore, the total number of items on Jerry's shelf is 9 books and 5 action figures."
Response:  We have two pigeons already sitting on the fence (P1 and P2). Then, more birds come to join them (P3, P4, P5, and P6). So, in total, we have 6 birds sitting on the fence now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 pigeons on the fence. Then, 4 more pigeons joined them. So, in total, there are now 8 pigeons on the fence. Therefore, in the beginning, there were 4 pigeons on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 birds and 46 squirrels sitting on the fence initially. If 6 more birds join them, then we will have: Birds = 4 + 6 = 10 Squirrels = 46 - 6 = 40 So, there are 10 birds and 40 squirrels sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  We have three birds and two storks already sitting on the fence. If five more birds join them, then we will have: 3 + 2 = 5 birds standing on the fence. So, there are 5 birds standing on the fence in total.
Response:  We have three birds and four storks initially. If two more birds join them, then we will have: Birds - 3 + 2 = 5 new birds. So, now there are 5 birds and 4 storks, which means that the total number of birds is greater than the number of storks by 5 - 4 = 1. Therefore, there are 1 more bird than stork standing on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds and six crows initially sitting on the fence. Then three more birds join them, so now we have five birds in total (2 + 3 = 5). Now let's count the number of crows again: 6 + 3 = 9. Therefore, there are nine crows and five birds standing on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 squirrels sitting on the fence. If two more squirrels joined them, then the total number of squirrels would be: 6 + 2 = 8 squirrels. Therefore, there are 8 squirrels on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and four storks initially seated on the fence. If six more storks join them, then we will have: Birds - 3 Storks - 4 + 6 = 10 Total number of birds and storks standing on the fence is 10. Therefore, there are 10 pigeons and 10 storks standing on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have: Birds = 6 + Storks = 3 = 9 creatures sitting on the fence. Then, two more storks joined them, so now we have: Birds = 6 + Storks = 5 = 11 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 2 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have: Birds = 4 Storks = 3 Now, when additional 6 storks joined them, we have: Total number of storks = 6 + 3 = 9 Therefore, the ratio of storks to birds is 9 : 4 or 9/4.
Response:  We have six birds already sitting on the fence. If four more birds join them, there will be ten birds in total (6 + 4 = 10). Then, eight storks arrive and join the group. So, we have ten birds plus eight storks, which makes a total of eighteen birds standing on the fence (10 + 8 = 18). Therefore, the answer is 18 pigeons stand on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, another five birds and four swallows join them. So, in total, we have 7 birds (2 + 5) standing on the fence. Now, there are 4 swallows who joined later, so the number of birds standing on the fence is 7 - 4 = 3 more than the number of swallows. Therefore, the answer is 3 more pigeons than swallows standing on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and two more birds join them, so we have 5 birds in total. Then, six storks arrive, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (3 + 2 + 6 = 11). So, there are 11 - 3 = 8 birds left after the storks arrive. Therefore, there are 8 bird sitting on the fence plus 2 additional birds that joined later, making a total of 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three storks and four additional birds that joined them, making a total of seven birds on the fence. So, there are seven more birds than storks on the fence.

"Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, six swallows and two other birds join them. So, in total, we have:
3 + 6 = 9 birds standing on the fence. Therefore, there are more swallows than birds."
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 59 (48 + 11). Now, let's compare the lengths of the two chapters: Chapter 1 has 48 pages, and Chapter 2 has 11 pages. Therefore, the difference between their lengths is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. So, the first chapter is longer than the second one by 37 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first head has 37 pages. Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second head. We are told that the second head is 80 pages long. Therefore, to find out how many pages are in the second head, we can subtract the number of pages in the first head from 80. So, if the first head has 37 pages, and we want to find out how many pages are in the second head, we can subtract 37 from 80, which gives us 43 pages. Therefore, there are 43 pages in the second head relative to the first head.
Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in total and the first chapter has 60 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 33 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two heads in the book and the second head has 36 pages. So, if we divide the total number of pages (67) by 2, we get the number of pages in the first head:  $67 / 2 = 33$ pages. Therefore, the first head has 33 pages.
Response:  First head has 66 pages, second head has 35 pages, and third head has 24 pages. So total number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the first head has 91 pages and the second head has 23 pages. Therefore, if we subtract the number of pages in the second head from the number of pages in the first head, we get:  Number of pages in the first head - Number of pages in the second head = 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first head has 35 pages and the third head has 3 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the third head from the number of pages in the first head, we get: 35 - 3 = 32 pages. Therefore, there are 32 pages in the second chapter compared to the third chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 100 = 300 pages.  Secondly, we know that the first chapter has 53 pages, and the second chapter has 75 pages. Therefore, the third chapter must have 300 - (53 + 75) = 300 - 128 = 172 pages. So, the first chapter has 53 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages Now, we have found out that the book has 1931 pages.
"Response:  We know that the book has 2 heads and each head contains 23 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in first head = 10 + (Number of pages in second head - 23) Now, let's substitute the value given in the question for ""Number of pages in second head"": Number of pages in first head = 10 + (23 - 23) = 10 + 0 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 pages in the first head of the book."
Response:  We know that there are two heads in the book and each head has 81 pages. So, we can say that the total number of pages in the book is equal to twice the number of heads times the number of pages per head. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:  Pages = 2 x 81 = 162 pages. Since the second head starts at page 68, we can calculate the number of pages in the second head as follows: Number of pages in second head = Page 68 + Total number of pages in book - First head (pages) = 68 + 162 - 81 = 97 pages.
Response:  We know that 62 people went to work in the morning and 39 people went to work in the afternoon. So, if we subtract the number of people who went to work in the afternoon from those who went to work in the morning, we get: 62 - 39 = 23 more people worked in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, there are 23 more people who worked in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that 52 people went to work in the morning and 61 people went to work in the afternoon. So, we have:

Morning (52): 52 x 1 = 52
Afternoon (61): 61 x 1 = 61

So, there are more people who worked in the afternoon than in the morning by 61 - 52 = 9 people."
Response:  We know that 15 lagers have gone to work in the morning and several more have gone to work in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of people who went to work in the morning = 15 + x Where 'x' is the number of people who went to work in the afternoon. Now, we are told that there were altogether 32 lagers who worked that day. Therefore, we can set up another equation: Total number of people who worked = 15 + x + y Where 'y' is the number of people who worked in the evening. Now, we need to find out how many people worked in the afternoon (x). To do this, we use the first equation: Number of people who went to work in the morning = 15 + x Substituting the value of 'x' from the second equation, we get: Number of people who went to work in the morning = 15 + x = 32 x Now, we can solve for 'x': x = 32 / 15 = 2 So, 2 people went to work in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is: People who went to work in the afternoon = 2.
"Response:  We know that some of the campers woke up early in the morning and seven others in the afternoon. If 60 people were awake during the day, then the number of people who greeted in the morning is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of people who greeted in the morning}} = \frac{\text{Total number of people awake}}{\text{Number of people who greeted in the afternoon}} $$

We are given that there are 7 people who greeted in the afternoon, so we can plug this value into the equation above:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of people who greeted in the morning}} = \frac{60}{7} = 8 \boxed{\text{people}} $$

Therefore, 8 people greeted in the morning."
Response:  We know that there are 36 lagers in total and each lager has 8 hours of work (greba). So, we have: 36 x 8 = 288 hours of work per day. Now, let's calculate how many days they worked: 288 hours / 8 hours per day = 36 days. Therefore, the number of lagers who grebah is 36 days.
Response:  We know that there are 44 lagers in total and we want to find out how many more people were working during sunrise than during evening. So, let's calculate the difference between the number of workers at sunrise and the number of workers at evening. According to the question, there are 39 fewer workers during evening than during sunrise. Therefore, the answer is: More people worked during sunrise than during evening by 44 - 39 = 7 people.
Response:  We know that there are 53 people greeting in the morning, and we want to find out how many more people greet in the evening than in the morning. So let's subtract the number of people who greet in the evening from the number of people who greet in the morning: 53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more people who greet in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  We know that there are 34 lagers of people working in the afternoon and 10 lagers of people working in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: 34 - 10 = x, where x is the number of lagers of people working in the morning. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x/2 = 34 - 10. Simplifying, we get x = 24. Therefore, there are 24 more lagers of people working in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 lazily campers went fishing and 59 lazy campers went for a walk in the morning. So, the total number of lazy campers is: 13 + 59 = 72. Now we are told that 21 of these campers went fishing in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of lazy campers who did not go fishing is: 72 - 21 = 51.
Response:  We know that 29 people left early in the morning and 66 people went for a walk after breakfast. So, the total number of people who went for a walk is: 29 + 66 = 95 people. Therefore, there are 95 more people who walked in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 41 laziness campers went out to fish and 4 went for a walk in the morning. Therefore, there are 37 campers who stayed at the campsite during this time (41 - 4 = 37).  Now let's find out how many of these 37 campers went fishing in the afternoon. According to the question, 26 campers went fishing after breakfast (26 + 0 = 26), so we have 11 campers who did not go fishing (37 - 26 = 11).  Therefore, 11 campers grebled and climbed trees.
Response:  We know that 43 people greeted in the morning and several more in the afternoon. So, let's assume that the number of people who greeted in the afternoon is x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:  Number of people who greeted in the afternoon = x + 43 (since 43 people greeted in the morning) Now, we are asked to find out how many people greeted in the afternoon. To do this, we need to solve the above equation for x. Solving for x, we get: x = 40 ( since there were 40 additional people who greeted in the afternoon) Therefore, 40 people greeted in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel collected 4 apples from her tree and there were 7 apples in the beginning, then after collecting 4 apples, there will be 3 apples left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, the number of apples on the tree is 3.
Response:  At first, the tree had 4 apples. Then, Rachel collected some apples and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, Rachel must have collected 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 7 mature apples from her tree and now there are 5 more mature apples left on the tree. So, in total, Rachel collected 7 + 5 = 12 mature apples. Now, we need to find out how many immature apples were left on the tree after Rachel collected the mature ones. Since three of them are immature, the number of immature apples is equal to the number of mature apples minus three (12 - 3 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 immature apples left on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked two mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 7 apples in total. If 6 of them are mature and the remaining ones are immature, then we can assume that there were initially X mature apples on the tree. Since Rachel picked 2 mature apples, the number of mature apples left on the tree is X - 2. So, the number of immature apples on the tree at the beginning was X.
Response:  We know that Rachel gathered 6 mature apples from her tree. So initially, there were 6 + 2 = 8 apples on the tree (including both mature and immature ones). Now, after Rachel collected 6 more mature apples, there are 8 - 6 = 2 mature apples left on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree in the beginning was 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 3 mature apples from her tree. So, initially, the tree had 3 + 27 = 30 immature apples. Now, the tree has 2 mature apples and 27 immature apples. Therefore, the total number of mature apples on the tree is 2. Hence, the tree should have 30 - 2 = 28 immature apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel gathered 7 apples from her tree in the beginning. Then, two new apples grew on the tree afterward. So, the total number of apples on the tree now is 7 + 2 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Rachel had 2 apples from her tree initially. Then she picked 4 apples from the tree, leaving 2 + 4 = 6 apples on the tree. After that, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree in total. Therefore, the number of apples on Rachel's tree is 9.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 52 apple trees and she takes two apples from one of them. So now she has 52 - 2 = 50 apple trees left. Then, she takes 7 apples from one of her remaining trees, so she has 50 - 7 = 43 apple trees left. Therefore, there were initially 43 apples on each tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel has collected 8 apples from each of the three trees. So, she has collected in total 8 x 3 = 24 apples. Now, we are told that there were originally 9 apples on all the trees combined. Therefore, the number of apples on each tree was 9 - 24 = -15. Since there were negative numbers of apples on each tree, it means that initially there were no apples on any of the trees!
Response:  We know that Racheal has 4 apple trees and she collected 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, she collected 4 x 7 = 28 apples. Therefore, there are 28 - 7 = 21 apples left on the trees.
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more tops than Doug before they played at the playground. So, if Ed had 30 tops and Doug had 28 tops, then Ed had 2 + 2 = 4 more tops than Doug. Now, we are told that Doug lost some of his tops at the playground. Since he only has 28 tops left after losing some, he must have had 28 + 4 = 32 tops initially. Therefore, Ed gained 32 - 28 = 4 tops from Doug after playing at the playground.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more tops than Doug. So, if Ed has x tops and Doug has y tops, then we can write an equation:
x = 10 + y
We also know that Doug lost 11 of his tops at the playground. So, after losing those tops, he has:
y - 11 = x - 10
Now we need to solve for x (the number of tops Ed has). To do this, we can add both equations together:
x = y - 11 + 10
Substituting y = 45 (the number of tops Doug initially had), we get:
x = 45 - 11 + 10
x = 34
So, Ed has 34 tops more than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more tops than Doug. So, if Ed had 22 tops, then Doug had 16 tops (22 - 6 = 16). Now, we are told that Doug lost 7 of his tops at the playground. Therefore, Doug has 9 tops left (16 - 7 = 9).
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more tops than Doug. So, if Ed had x tops initially, then Doug had x - 5 tops initially. Since Doug lost 3 of his tops at the playground, he now has x - 3 tops. Therefore, the number of tops Ed initially had is 27 - 5 = 22.
"Response:  ED had 24 more tops than DOUG. If DOUG lost 27 of his tops at the playground while ED found 9 more tops, then...

ED had 24 + 9 = 33 more tops than DOUG after finding those extra tops. So, ED has 33 - 27 = 6 more tops than DOUG."
Response:  Еd had 29 more tops than Dug. So, Ed had 29 + x tops, where x is the number of tops that Ed lost at the playground. Since Ed lost 17 tops at the playground, we can write:  Ed had 29 + 17 = 46 tops in total. Therefore, Ed had 46 - 17 = 29 more tops than Dug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 20 more tops than Doug at first. So, Ed had 20 + 19 = 39 tops in total. Then, Ed lost some of his tops on the playground. Now, he has 8 more tops than Doug, which means he has 39 - 8 = 31 tops left. Therefore, Ed lost 7 tops (31 - 20).
"Response:  Ed had 30 more tops than Doug. If Ed lost 21 of his tops at the playground, then he has fewer tops now. So, if Ed had x tops initially and Doug had y tops initially, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:
x + 30 = y (since Ed had 30 more tops than Doug)
After Ed lost 21 tops, his new total is:
x - 21 = y - 21 (since Doug did not lose any tops)
Now, we are asked how many more tops Ed has than Doug. We can use the second equation to find this:
x - y = 91 (since Ed has 91 more tops than Doug)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 121 (since y = 71)
So, Ed has 121 tops and Doug has 71 tops."
Response:  Ed had 12 more tops than Doug. So, if Ed had 17 tops initially and lost 20 of them, then he has 17 - 20 = 7 tops left. Therefore, Doug has (12 + 7) = 19 tops now.
Response:  If 408 students have suggested potato pudding and 42 students have suggested bacon, then we can say that for every student who has suggested bacon, there are 10 students who have suggested potato pudding (since 408 / 42 = 10). So, if 40 students have suggested bacon, then 400 students (40 x 10) have suggested potato pudding. Therefore, the number of students who have suggested potato pudding is 3 times the number of students who have suggested bacon.
"Response:  If 479 students have suggested adding potato puree and 489 have suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we can say that the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested potato puree. So, the difference between these two numbers is:

489 - 479 = 10

Therefore, 10 more students have suggested bacon than those who have suggested potato puree."
Response:  Since 185 students have already suggested adding potato puree to the menu, and we are asked how many students have suggested adding bacon, we can conclude that 185 + x = 310, where x is the number of students who suggested adding bacon.  Therefore, there were 125 students (185 - 60) who suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  Since 264 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, and 288 students were asked for their suggestions in total, we can conclude that 104 (264 - 184) students suggested adding carrot pudding to the menu. Therefore, 104 students proposed carrot puree.
Response:  If 63 students have suggested adding carrot pudding to the menu and not bacon (as mentioned in the problem), then we can conclude that 494 students (63 + 457) have suggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, 494 students have suggested adding bacon.
Response:  If 182 students have proposed adding potato puree and 166 more students have proposed adding bacon than those who suggested potato puree, then we can say that 106 (166 - 60) students have proposed adding bacon. Therefore, there are 106 students who have proposed adding bacon.
Response:  If 324 students have suggested adding potato puree to the menu, and 374 students have suggested adding bacon, then together they make up 798 students (324 + 374 = 798). And if 128 students have suggested adding tomatoes, that makes a total of 926 students (798 + 128 = 926) who have participated in the suggestion for new food items. Therefore, there are 926 students who have participated in the decision-making process.
Response:  If 257 students have suggested potato puree, and 120 have suggested bacon, then there are 37 more students who have suggested potato puree than bacon (257 - 120 = 37). Therefore, there are 37 more students who prefer potato puree to bacon.
Response:  If 144 students have suggested potato puree, and 467 have suggested bacon, then there are more students who have suggested potato puree than bacon (144 > 467). Similarly, if 79 students have suggested tomatoes, then there are fewer students who have suggested tomatoes than those who have suggested potato puree (79 < 144). Therefore, the number of students who have suggested potato puree is greater than the number of students who have suggested tomatoes by 65 (144 - 79) students.
Response:  If 228 students have suggested adding potato puree to the menu, and 337 students have suggested adding bacon, then there are more students who want bacon than those who want potato puree (337 - 228 = 109). On the other hand, if only 23 students have suggested adding tomatoes, then there are fewer students who want tomatoes than those who want bacon (109 - 23 = 86). Therefore, more students have suggested bacon than those who have suggested tomatoes.
Response:  If Sofia asked the students to propose specific types of food from a total of 66 options, and if 450 students proposed adding potato puree, 38 proposed adding bacon, and none of the remaining students participated, then we can calculate the number of students who participated in the proposal for new food as follows: Number of participants = Total number of students - Number of students who did not participate (in this case, 217) = 450 - 217 = 233 So, 233 students participated in the proposal for new food.
Response:  If 218 students have suggested adding potato puree and bacon, then there are 218 + 351 = 579 students who have not suggested adding bacon. Therefore, the number of students who have suggested adding bacon is 351 - 579 = -268. So, there are -268 students who have suggested adding bacon.
"Response:  We know that out of 269 students, 330 have suggested adding potato puree to the menu and 76 have suggested adding dumplings. So, we can write this as:

330 + 76 = 406

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potato puree than those who suggested dumplings:

406 - 76 = 330

Therefore, 130 more students suggested potato puree than those who suggested dumplings."
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 569 students in total, then the number of girls must be greater than or equal to the number of boys. Therefore, we can write an inequality as follows:  Number of girls = 569 - 236 = 333  Since 333 is greater than or equal to 236 (the number of boys), we have established that there are more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in the school and 841 boys. So, if we divide the number of boys (841) by the number of girls (34), we get:  Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.6 Therefore, there are approximately 26 boys in the school for every girl.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls (mo...
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of girls.  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of boys = 697 - 228 = 469  Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 635 girls and 510 boys, then the number of boys is greater than the number of girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 510 - 635 = -325. Since negative numbers indicate a smaller quantity, we can conclude that there are 325 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 students in total and 281 of them are girls, then the number of boys is: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Number of boys = 868 - 281 Number of boys = 587 Therefore, there are 587 male students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls, then the total number of students is:  Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of students = 700 + (142 - 700)  Total number of students = 700 + (-70)  Total number of students = 630 Therefore, there are 630 students in this school, including both boys and girls.
Response:  Initially, there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. Then, 418 girls joined the school, so the total number of girls became: 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Now, we need to find out how many boys are left in the school after 418 girls joined. The initial number of boys was 222, so the remaining number of boys is: 222 - 418 = -196 boys. Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is: 1124 (girls) + (-196) (boys) = 928 students.
Response:  Initially, there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls join the school, so now there are 902 + 44 = 946 girls in total. Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 946.
Response:  Initially, there are 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, another 465 girls join the school. So, the total number of girls in the school is now: 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Therefore, the final answer is 1097.
Response:  At first, there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school. So, now we have to find out how many girls are left. To do this, we need to subtract the number of girls who joined from the total number of girls initially: Number of girls initially = 732 Number of girls who joined = 682 Subtracting the number of girls who joined from the initial number gives us the final number of girls in the school: Number of girls in the school now = 732 - 682 = 50 Girls. Therefore, there are 50 girls in the school now.
Response:  Initially, there are 214 boys in the school. Then, 910 more boys join the school, so the total number of boys becomes: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, together they make up 626 students (308 + 318). Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in total at the school. There are 36 teachers, so let's add them to our total: 626 + 36 = 662. Therefore, there are 662 students and 36 teachers in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is: 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in the school overall. There are 772 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is: 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are x boys, then the number of girls is x + 402. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (402) = 739. Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method to find out the value of x, which is equal to 337. Hence, there are 337 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are x boys, then there are x + 458 girls. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (458) = 692. Now solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method to find out the number of boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. Then, another 403 girls joined the school. So, the total number of girls in the school now is:  Initially, there were 362 boys + 257 girls = 619 students in the school. Now, let's add the new number of girls who joined the school:  New number of girls = 403 + 257 = 660 students. Therefore, there are currently 660 girls in the school.
Response:  Еduard had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Еduard has $2 now.
Response:  Еduard had $13 and spent a little money. Now he has $3 left. So, Edouard spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Before Edward spent $9 and then $8, he had $10 - $9 = $1 in his pocket. So, he had $10 + $8 = $18 before spending any money.
Response:  We know that Еduard spent $16 for 92 books, so each book cost him $0.18. Now he has $6 left. So, before spending the money, Еduard had $6 + $0.18 x 92 = $57.40. Therefore, Еduard had $57.40 before he spent the money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 on two books, so each book cost him half of that amount: $\$3$. Now we are told that he has $\$12$ left after buying the books, which means that the total cost of the two books is less than or equal to $\$12$: $$ \boxed{\text{Cost of each book} = \ \$3 \leq \ \$12} $$ So, the cost of each book is at most $\$9$.
Response:  Еduard had $25 before spending money ($6 for books + $16 for chemistry sets). After spending, he has $19 left. So, Еduard spent $6 + $16 = $22.
Response:  Едуард е похарчил 4 долара за книги and 3 долара for chemistry sets. So he spent in total $4 + $3 = $7. Now he has $12 - $7 = $5 left.
Response:  Едуард е похарчил $16 for books and $8 for chemistry sets. Now he has $19. So, he spent more money on books than on chemistry sets. To find out how much more, we can subtract the amount he spent on chemistry sets from the total amount he spent: $16 - $8 = $8. Therefore, Еduard spent $8 more on books than on chemistry sets.
Response:  Before he spent $17, Edouard had $X dollars. Since he received $10 from his friend after spending $17, now he has $X - $10 = $7. So, Edouard had $X = $7 + $17 = $24 before he spent the money.
Response:  We know that Захари made 44 push-ups today. David made 58 more than Захари. So, David made 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups today. Therefore, Захари and David together made 102 + 44 = 146 push-ups today.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 push-ups and David made 44 push-ups today in gymnastics class. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David made from the number of push-ups Zachary made:

Zachary made 51 push-ups - David made 44 push-ups = 7 push-ups
So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David."
Response:  We know that David made 44 push-ups today and Zachary made 9 more than David. So, if David made x push-ups, then Zachary made x + 9 push-ups.  Substituting the value of x = 44 in this equation, we get:  x + 9 = 53  Solving for x, we get:  x = 45  Therefore, Zachary made 45 push-ups today.
Response:  David made 51 gymnastics moves today. Zachary made 49 more than David. So, Zachary made 51 + 49 = 100 gymnastics moves today.
Response:  We know that David made more than Zachary but fewer than him. So, if D... (read more)
"Response:  We know that D...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that David made 29 more movements than Zachari, so he made 65 movements (29 + 36). Since David also made 13 fewer squats than Zachari, David made 32 squats (17 - 13). Therefore, David performed 65 squats and 32 squats = 97 movements in gymnastics today."
Response:  We know that David made 17 more than Zachary and 10 less than him. So, if Zachary did x push-ups and sit-ups, then David did x + 17 = 27 push-ups and sit-ups. Since David is 10 less than Zachary, he did x - 10 = 17 push-ups and sit-ups. Now we can find out how many push-ups and sit-ups Zachary did by subtracting 17 from his total number of exercises: x - 17 = 36 (push-ups) and x - 17 = 29 (sit-ups). Therefore, Zachary performed 36 push-ups and 29 sit-ups today.
Response:  We know that Zachari made 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gymnastics today. David made 58 more pull-ups than Zachari, but 87 fewer than him. So, if Zachari did x push-ups, then David did x + 58 = 143 push-ups. Therefore, David did 106 more push-ups than Zachari.
Response:  We know that David made 38 more pull-ups than Zachari, but he did 62 fewer push-ups than Zachari. So, if Zachari did x push-ups and pull-ups, then David did x + 38 - 62 = x + 70 push-ups and pull-ups. Therefore, Zachari did 46 + 70 = 116 movements in gymnastics today.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 19 push-ups today. David made 39 more than Zachary, so David made 39 + 19 = 58 push-ups. John did 13 fewer than David, so John made 58 - 13 = 45 push-ups. Therefore, David made 45 push-ups today.
Response:  We know that David made 22 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 51 push-ups, then David did 73 (51 + 22). John did 4 fewer than David, so he did 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69).
Response:  We know that David made 39 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 15 push-ups, then David did 54 (39 + 15). John did 9 fewer than David, so he did 46 push-ups (David did 54 - 9 = 46). Therefore, Zachary did 15 - 46 = -31 less push-ups than John.
Response:  We know that David made 30 more tumbling passes than Zachary today. So if David did 37 tumbling passes, then Zachary did x = 30 - 37 = 4 tumbling passes.
Response:  We know that David made 56 more throws than Zachary today. So if David threw x times, then Zachary threw x - 56 times.  Since they together threw 38 times, we can write an equation:  x + (x - 56) = 38  Simplifying the equation: 2x = 38  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:  x = 19  Therefore, David and Zachary together threw 19 times.
"Response:  We know that David made more than 40 presses but fewer than Zachary in gymnastics today. So, if Zachary did 34 presses and 62 squeaks, then David must have done x squeaks, where x is the difference between their numbers of squeaks. Since David made 40 more presses than Zachary, we can write an equation as follows:

David’s number of squeaks = Zachary’s number of squeaks + 40
Substituting Zachary’s values into this equation gives us:

David’s number of squeaks = 34 + 40
= 74
Therefore, David made 74 squeaks in gymnastics today."
Response:  David made 36 more throws than Zachary in gymnastics today, but Zachary made 33 fewer throws than David. So, if Zachary threw 58 times and David threw 94 times (including the extra throws), then David threw 36 + 33 = 70 more throws than Zachary.
Response:  David made 27 more twists than Zachary in gymnastics today, but 7 fewer than Zachary. If Zachary makes 5 tucks and 17 backflips, how many backflips does Zachary make?  We know that David made 27 more twists than Zachary, so if Zachary makes x backflips, David will make 27 + x backflips. Since David made 7 fewer backflips than Zachary, we can set up an equation as follows: 27 + x = 34. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. So, Zachary makes 9 backflips.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of homework in reading. So, we have:
Mathematics: 5 pages = 5 x 1 page = 5 pages
Reading: 2 pages = 2 x 1 page = 2 pages
Therefore, there are more tasks assigned for mathematics than for reading, with a difference of 3 pages (5 - 2)."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to finish 3 pages of homework in mathematics and 4 pages of homework in reading. So, if she has finished 3 pages of homework in mathematics, then she still needs to finish 2 pages (4 - 3 = 2). Therefore, Rachel has more than 3 pages of homework left in mathematics.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics and additional 7 pages for reading. So, in total she had to finish 12 pages (5 + 7) of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 7 pages of homework in mathematics and she needs to finish 4 more pages than in mathematics. So, we can write an equation as follows: Mathematics = 7 pages Homework = 7 + 4 = 11 pages Reading = 11 - 4 = 7 pages Therefore, Rachel needs to finish 7 pages of reading homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 8 pages of homework in total, and she already finished 5 pages of homework for math. So, we need to find out how many pages Rachel needs to finish for reading. Since Rachel finished 5 pages more than her homework for math, we can say that she finished 5 + 3 = 8 pages more than her homework for reading. Therefore, Rachel needs to finish 8 - 8 = 0 pages of homework for reading.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 6 more pages of homework in mathematics, and she already has 8 pages to complete, then she needs to finish an additional 6 / 8 = 3/4 page of homework in mathematics. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 8 + (3/4) = 10 1/2 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel already has to finish 10 pages of homework in mathematics and she needs to add 3 more pages, then we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Existing pages + Additional pages = 10 + 3 = 13 pages So, Rachel needs to finish 13 pages of homework in mathematics.
Response:  Racheal needs to finish 2 pages of homework in mathematics, 3 pages of homework in reading, and 10 pages of homework in biology. Therefore, she needs to finish a total of 15 pages of homework (2 + 3 + 10 = 15).
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to finish 9 pages of homework in mathematics, 2 pages of homework in reading, and 96 pages of homework in biology. So, we have:
Mathematics: 9 pages = 9/1 = 9
Reading: 2 pages = 2/1 = 2
Biology: 96 pages = 96/1 = 96
Therefore, there are more assignments in mathematics than in reading or biology."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to finish 11 pages of homework in total.  From this information alone, we can determine that there are more pages of mathematics than any other subject. So, the difference between the number of pages of mathematics and biology is equal to or greater than 9 (since 11 - 2 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of homework in mathematics, 11 pages of homework in reading, and 8 pages of homework in biology. So, the total number of pages she had to complete is: 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages. Therefore, there were 26 more pages of homework in biology than in mathematics.
Response:  We know that Rachel needs to finish 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far, so good! However, we are also given that she has finished 29 pages of biology homework. Now, let's subtract the number of pages she has already finished from the total number of pages she needs to finish:  Total pages needed = 9 + 11 + 29 = 60 pages. Therefore, Rachel needs to finish 60 - 29 = 31 pages of math and reading comprehension homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to finish 8 pages of homework in mathematics and 7 pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, she needed to finish 15 pages of homework (8 + 7 = 15). However, we are also given that she finished 3 pages of homework in biology, so she actually completed 12 pages of homework in total (15 - 3 = 12).
Response:  According to the question, Rachel needs to finish 5 pages of homework in mathematics, 10 pages of homework in reading, and 6 pages of homework in biology. So, the total number of pages she needs to finish is: 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages. Therefore, Rachel needs to finish 21 pages of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel needs to finish 2 pages of reading and 4 pages of math. So, if she has more tasks for math than for reading, then...
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 4 pages of reading comprehension and 7 pages of mathematics. So, the total number of pages she needs to finish is 4 + 7 = 11 pages. Now, we are asked how many more pages of math there are than pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, the difference between these two quantities is 11 - 4 = 7 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Djack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 in the evening. So, he received a total of 8 emails (6 + 2). Therefore, Djack received more emails in the morning than in the evening. The difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and evening is 8 - 2 = 6.
Response:  Dжак received 6 emails in the morning and 8 in the evening, so he received a total of 14 emails. Since we are asked how many more emails he received in the evening than in the morning, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the evening:  14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, Dжак received 8 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and several more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 4 + x = 5 emails during the day, where x is the number of emails he received in the afternoon. Since we know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, we can conclude that he received 4 + 3 = 7 emails during the day. Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Djack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, and 5 in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails during the day.
Response:  Dжак received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 13 emails (5 + 8). Therefore, Dжак received 13 emails in total.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning, 5 emails in the afternoon, and 8 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 17 emails. Now, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon (i.e., 5 emails). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  Djack received 3 emails in the morning, 4 in the afternoon, and 8 in the evening. So he received a total of 15 emails. Therefore, Djack received 3 emails in the morning (out of 3) and 2 emails in the evening (out of 8), for a total of 5 emails received during the daytime hours.
Response:  According to the question, Djack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 in the afternoon, and 17 in the evening. So, he received a total of 34 emails. Now, we need to find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of afternoons (7) from the number of mornings (10): 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, Djack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the question, Djack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of 9 + 10 + 7 = 26 emails. So, Djack received more emails in the afternoon (10) than in the morning (9).
Response:  According to the question, Djack received 10 emails in the morning, 5 in the afternoon, and 4 in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of 29 emails (10 + 5 + 4). Now, we need to find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the evening. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the afternoon:  Number of emails received in the afternoon - Number of emails received in the evening = 29 - 4 = 25. So, Djack received 25 more emails in the afternoon than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, and several more in the evening. So, he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning. Then he received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. So, during the day (morning + afternoon), Jack received a total of 8 emails and 118 letters. Therefore, Jack received 8 emails during the day.
Response:  Djaq received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning. Then he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Djaq received 14 emails (5 + 9) and 13 letters (6 + 7). Therefore, Djaq received 14 + 13 = 27 messages during the day.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 22 messages in the morning (10 + 12 = 22). Then, he received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon, so he received a total of 47 messages in the afternoon (3 + 44 = 47). Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is:  47 - 22 = 25. So, Djaк received 25 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning, so he received an average of 6 + 8 = 14 messages per day. Then, he received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon, so he received an average of 2 + 7 = 9 messages per day. Therefore, Jack received more messages in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and sent 91 emails during that time. Then he received 2 more emails and sent 74 emails in the evening. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails during the daytime.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 emails in the morning. Then he received 6 emails and sent 8 emails in the afternoon. So, how many emails did Jack send per day? We can calculate this as follows: Number of emails sent = Total number of emails received x Percentage of emails sent / 100 Total number of emails received = 4 + 6 = 10 Emails received Total percentage of emails sent = (Number of emails sent / Total number of emails received) x 100 % = (8/10) x 100% = 80% Therefore, Jack sends 80% of his total emails per day, which is equal to 8 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 7 emails in the morning and then some more later in the day. So, he received a total of 7 + x emails during the day, where x is the number of emails he received after noon. Since we are asked how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we can conclude that x = 3 (the number of additional emails he received). Therefore, Jack received a total of 7 + 3 = 10 emails during the day.
Response:  We know that Djack received 3 emails in the evening and 5 emails in the morning. So, he received a total of 8 emails (3 + 5). Now, we need to find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning:  Number of emails received in the morning - Number of emails received in the evening = 5 - 3 = 2 Therefore, Djack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the evening, 6 in the morning, and several more in the evening. So, he received a total of 3 + 6 = 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails per day.
Response:  Сkaкалката and frog are competing in jumping. The rabbit jumps 9 inches, while the frog jumps 12 inches. How far does the frog jump beyond the rabbit? We can calculate this as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + Acceleration x Time^2 (Distance formula) Rabbit's speed is 9 inches/jump, and its acceleration is 0 m/s^2 (since it doesn't accelerate). Frog's speed is also 9 inches/jump, but its acceleration is 2 m/s^2 (since it accelerates from rest to top speed). Now we need to find out how long each animal takes to jump that distance. For the rabbit, time = distance / speed = 9 inches / 9 inches/jump = 1 second. For the frog, time = distance / speed = 12 inches / 9 inches/jump = 1.33 seconds (since it accelerates for half of the time). Now we can use the equation again: Distance = Speed x Time + Acceleration x Time^2 Distance = 9 inches/jump x 1 second + 2 m/s^2 x (1 second)^2 Distance = 9 inches + 4 m/s^2 Distance = 13 inches (answer) So, the frog jumps 13 inches beyond the rabbit after one second of acceleration.
Response:  Сkaкалката has jumped 30 cm and frog has jumped 35 cm. So, their total distance traveled is:  Distance = Skaakalka + Frog = 30 + 35 = 65 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 17 inches more than the distance traveled by the squirrel. So, if the squirrel traveled 36 inches, then the frog traveled 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Therefore, the frog can jump 53 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 18 inches more than the distance traveled by the squirrel. So, if the squirrel traveled 25 inches, then the frog traveled 25 + 18 = 43 inches. Now, we are told that the mouse traveled 2 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is 43 - 2 = 41 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 10 inches more than the distance traveled by the squirrel. So, if the squirrel traveled 19 inches, then the frog traveled 10 + 19 = 29 inches.  Now, we are told that the mouse traveled 20 inches more than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point of the squirrel is 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 39 inches more than the distance traveled by the rabbit. So, if the rabbit traveled x inches, then the frog traveled x + 39 inches.  Secondly, we are told that the mouse traveled x - 94 inches less than the frog. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information as follows: (x + 39) = (x - 94).  Solving for x, we get: x = 75.  Hence, the frog traveled 75 inches further than the rabbit.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 32 inches more than the distance traveled by the rabbit. So, if the rabbit traveled x inches, then the frog traveled x + 32 inches.  Secondly, we know that the mouse traveled x - 26 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse can be calculated as follows: x - (x + 32) = -26. Solving for x, we get x = 18 inches. Hence, the distance traveled by the mouse is 18 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 33 inches more than the distance traveled by the rabbit. So, if the rabbit traveled x inches, then the frog traveled x + 33 inches.  Secondly, we know that the mouse traveled x - 5 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is equal to the distance traveled by the frog minus 5 inches.  Now, let's substitute these values in the equation: x + 33 = (x + 5) - 5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 38 = 0. Solving for x, we find that the distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is 19 inches.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the springboard is 13 inches (as mentioned in the question). Now, let's analyze the given information to find out how far the frog jumps. According to the problem statement, ""the frog jumps 5 cm more than the springboard."" So, if the springboard reaches a distance of x cm from the starting point, then the frog will jump a distance of x + 5 cm from the same point. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this: Distance = Springboard + Frog Jump (in cm) Here, we are looking for the distance traveled by the frog. Now, we have two variables - x and y - which represent the distance covered by the springboard and the frog respectively. We are also given that the total distance traveled by both together is equal to 20 cm (as stated in the problem). So, we can set up the following equation: x + y = 20 (cm) Now, we need to solve for y, which represents the distance traveled by the frog. To do this, we can subtract x from both sides of the above equation: y = 20 - x (cm) Now, we have found the distance traveled by the frog. Finally, we convert it into meters by multiplying it with 100 since there are 100 cm in 1 m: Metres = Meters = 100 x (y / 100) = 100 x (20 - x) / 100 = 100 x (20 - x) / 100 = 100 x (13 / 100) = 13 / 100 = 0.13 m Now, we have found the distance traveled by the frog, which is approximately 0.13 m."
"Response:  The given information is as follows:

* Скакалката (hare) jumps 35 inches.
* Жабата (frog) jumps 10 cm (centimeters).

To find out how far they have jumped in total, we need to convert both measurements to the same unit of measurement, such as meters or feet.

1 meter = 100 centimeters
1 foot = 12 inches

So, let's convert the distances jumped by the hare and the frog to meters:

Hare: 35 inches x 2.54 cm/in = 89 cm / 1 m = 0.89 m
Frog: 10 cm x 10 cm/m = 0.1 m

Now, let's add up the distances jumped by both animals:

Total distance jumped = 0.89 m + 0.1 m = 0.99 m

Therefore, the overall distance jumped by both the hare and the frog is approximately 0.99 meters."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by each animal in their respective jumps. So, the total distance traveled by the frog can be calculated as follows:
Frog's distance = Squirrel's distance + Mouse's distance
= 19 inches + (10 cm / 2.54) = 19 x 3.87 = 68.53 cm
Now, we are given that the mouse has jumped 15 cm less than the squirrel. So, the distance traveled by the mouse can be calculated as follows:
Mouse's distance = Squirrel's distance - (15 cm / 2.54)
= 68.53 cm - (15 / 2.54) = 68.53 cm - 5.89 = 62.64 cm
Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog is 68.53 cm and the distance traveled by the mouse is 62.64 cm."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 39 inches more than the distance traveled by the mouse. So, if the mouse traveled x inches, then the frog traveled x + 39 inches.  Secondly, we are told that the mouse traveled less than half the distance traveled by the frog. This means that the mouse traveled an amount equal to (x + 39) / 2 inches.  Finally, we can set up the equation based on the information given in the question: x + (x + 39) / 2 = 19. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, the mouse traveled 14 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that ska...
Response:  We know that the length of the jump of the frog is 39 inches and the length of the jump of the grasshopper is 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumps beyond the grasshopper, we need to divide the length of the frog's jump by the length of the grasshopper's jump. So, if we divide 39 by 17, we get 2.26. This means that the frog jumps 2.26 times farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 20 cm more than the distance traveled by the mouse. So, if the mouse travels x cm, then the frog will travel x + 20 cm.  Secondly, we are told that the skater jumps 9 inches. Since there are 2.54 cm in an inch, the skater jumps 9 x 2.54 = 23.16 cm.  Finally, we can use the information given in the question to find out how far the mouse travels. We know that the mouse travels less than the skater by 10 cm. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is equal to the distance traveled by the skater minus 10 cm, which is 23.16 - 10 = 13.16 cm.  So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 13.16 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance traveled by the frog is 37 inches more than the distance traveled by the snake. So, if the snake traveled 14 inches, then the frog traveled 37 + 14 = 51 inches. Now, we are told that the mouse traveled less than the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse is less than 51 inches. But we don't have enough information to determine exactly how much less.
"Response:  Merry has already mixed 5 cups of flour and needs to add more flour equal to the amount of sugar required in the recipe. Since the recipe requires 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar, we can calculate the remaining amount of flour needed as follows:

Remaining flour = Required flour - Amount already mixed (5 cups)
= 14 cups - 5 cups
= 9 cups

Therefore, Merry needs to mix an additional 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  Merry has already added 4 cups of flour, which means she still needs to add 5 more cups (9 - 4 = 5). Now, we need to find out how much sugar is required based on the recipe. The recipe requires 11 cups of sugar, so Merry needs to add 6 more cups (11 - 5 = 6) to complete the recipe. Therefore, Merry needs to add an additional 6 cups of sugar.
Response:  Merry has already added some flour to make the dough and now she needs 8 more cups of flour than the amount of sugar required for the recipe. So, if the recipe requires 13 cups of sugar, then Merry needs 21 cups of flour (13 - 8 = 5). Therefore, Merry needs to add 5 more cups of flour to the dough.
"Response:  If Meri has already added several cups of flour and needs to add 2 more cups, then she must have added x cups of flour so far. Since the recipe requires 11 cups of flour in total, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 11

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So Meri has added 9 cups of flour so far. To find out how many cups of sugar she has used, we know that the recipe requires 7 cups of sugar and Meri has already added some sugar. Let's assume she has added y cups of sugar so far. We can set up the equation:

y + 7 = 7 (since Meri has already added some sugar)

Solving for y, we get:

y = 0

So Meri has not added any sugar yet. Therefore, the number of cups of flour Meri has added is 9."
"Response:  If Meri needs to add 6 more cups of flour according to the recipe, and she has already added 3 cups, then we need to find out how many cups are left to be added.  So, let's subtract the number of cups Meri has already added from the total amount needed:

Total amount of flour needed = 11 cups (according to the recipe) - 3 cups (amount Meri has already added) = 8 cups

Therefore, Meri still needs to add 8 more cups of flour to make the torte according to the recipe."
Response:  Merry has already mixed 4 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. She needs 12 cups of flour in total to make the cake recipe. If she has already mixed 4 cups, then she still needs 8 more cups (12 - 4 = 8). So, Merry has mixed 8 cups of flour so far.
"Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She has already mixed 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already mixed from the total amount required:

9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups
So, Merry needs to add 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 cups of sugar and Meri has already added 2 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (14) by the amount of sugar Meri has already added (2): 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, Meri needs to add 7 more cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Meri needs to make 12 cups of batter for her torte recipe. The recipe requires 5 cups of sugar and 49 cups of flour. She has already mixed 11 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to mix. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour required (49 cups) by the amount of flour she has already mixed (11 cups): 49 / 11 = 4.45 cups. Therefore, Meri needs to add 4.45 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  Merry has already mixed 7 cups of flour and needs to add more flour equal to the amount of sugar she used (2 cups). So, if she used 2 cups of sugar, then she needs to add an additional 2/5 cups of flour (since there are 5/6 cups of flour left to mix after mixing 7 cups). Therefore, Merry needs to add 3 1/4 cups of flour more.
Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 12 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. She has already added 2 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour are required. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour needed (12 cups) by the amount of flour Merry has added so far (2 cups): 12 / 2 = 6 cups. Therefore, Merry needs to add 6 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and she needs to add 3 more cups (since the recipe requires 6 cups). So, we need to subtract 5 from the total amount of flour required: 6 - 5 = 1 cup.  Now, let's check how much sugar is left in the recipe. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 7 cups. So, there are 1 cup of sugar remaining: 8 - 7 = 1 cup. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 1 cup of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She has already added 2 cups of sugar. So, how many more cups of sugar does she need to add?  Therefore, the answer is 11 cups (13 - 2 = 11).
Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, how many more cups of flour does she need to add now?  Therefore, the answer is 5 cups (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She has already added 2 cups of flour. So, how many more cups of flour does she need to add now?  Therefore, the answer is 7 cups (9 - 2 = 7).
Response:  Merry has already added 11 cups of flour, which means she still needs to add 4 more cups (14 - 11 = 3). Since each cup of sugar requires 5 cups of flour, Merry now needs to add 3 x 5 = 15 cups of sugar. So, Merry needs to add an additional 15 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If Meri has already added several cups of flour and needs 5 more cups to complete the recipe, then she must have added x cups of flour so far. Since the recipe requires 3x/4 cup sugar and 10x/4 cup flour, we can set up the equation:

3x = 10(x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

So Meri has added 20 cups of flour so far."
Response:  Merry has already mixed 4 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She needs to mix 13 cups of flour more. If she has already mixed some flour, then the number of cups she has left is equal to the total amount needed minus the amount she has already mixed. So, in this case, if she needs to mix 13 cups of flour more, and she has already mixed 4 cups, then the number of cups she has left is 13 - 4 = 9 cups. Therefore, Merry has mixed 9/10th of the required amount of flour.
"Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She has already mixed 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required:

6 cups (required) - 7 cups (added) = 9 cups (remaining)

Therefore, Merry needs to add 9 cups of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response:  Merry has already added 10 chambers of sugar and 12 chambers of flour. To find out how many more chambers of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the number of chambers she has already added from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe:

Total amount of sugar required = 11 chambers
Number of chambers Merry has already added = 10 chambers
So, Merry still needs to add 1 chamber of sugar."
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 6 cups of flour to make the dough. According to the recipe, we need 10 cups of flour in total. So, we have to add 4 more cups of flour (10 - 6 = 4). Therefore, Meri needs to add 4 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 4 cups of flour to make the dough. The recipe requires 14 cups of flour in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of flour are left to be added after Meri has added 4 cups. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added (4) from the total amount required (14): 14 - 4 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 cups of flour left to be added after Meri has added 4 cups. Now, let's check how much sugar is needed. According to the recipe, 9 cups of sugar are required in total, and Meri has already added 4 cups. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added after Meri has added 4 cups: 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 cups of sugar left to be added after Meri has added 4 cups.
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 2 cups of flour to make the dough. So, we need to add an additional amount equal to the original amount she had (3 cups). Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is: 3 + 2 = 5 cups.
Response:  We know that Meri has already added 12 cups of flour to make the dough. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour used, she needs to add 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of salt. So, if she has already added 12 cups of flour, she needs to add 3 cups of sugar and 4 cups of salt. Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 7 cups of sugar (3 cups x 2) and 6 cups of salt (4 cups x 2).
Response:  Merry is making a cake that requires 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She has already added 4 cups of sugar. So, how many more cups of sugar does she need to add?  Therefore, the answer is 3 more cups of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  If Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and needs to add an additional 4 cups (since the recipe requires 14 cups), then she will need to add 4/10 = 0.4 cups of flour more than the amount of sugar she has already added. So, she needs to add 4 + 0.4 = 4.4 cups of flour now.
Response:  We know that 19 families of birds live near the mountain and 60 families have migrated for winter. So, the total number of bird families in the area is: 19 + 60 = 79 families. Now, we need to find out how many more or fewer bird families stayed behind than migrated. To do this, we can divide the number of families that stayed behind (79) by the number of families that migrated (60): 79 / 60 = 1.3 (or approximately 1.3 times). Therefore, there are approximately 1.3 times as many bird families that remained in the area compared to those that migrated for winter.
Response:  We know that 87 penguin families live near the mountain and 7 of them have migrated for winter. So, the number of penguin families remaining in the area is: 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 penguin families left behind.
Response:  We know that 20 pigeon families migrated to warmer climates for winter and only 14 remained near the mountain. So, initially there were 20 + 14 = 34 bird families living nearby the mountain.
Response:  We know that 85 family of birds live near the mountain and they are about to migrate.  From the given options, we can see that 23 families have already migrated to Africa and 37 families have already migrated to Asia. So, the number of families who stayed nearby the mountain is equal to 85 - (23 + 37) = 19. Therefore, there are 19 bird families left near the mountain.
Response:  We know that eight families of penguins live near the mountain. If 42 bird families have migrated to Africa and 31 bird families have migrated to Asia, then we can say that the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa is greater than the number of bird families that have migrated to Asia. So, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the total number of bird families that have migrated to Africa minus the total number of bird families that have migrated to Asia.  Therefore, the answer is:  Difference = 42 - 31 = 11
Response:  We know that 38 penguin families live near the mountain and 162 penguin families have migrated to Africa or Asia. So, we can write an equation: 38 + 162 = x, where x is the number of penguin families that have migrated to Asia. Now, we are told that 94 penguin families have migrated to Asia, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 38 + 162 = 94. Solving for x, we get: x = 74. Therefore, there are 74 more penguin families that have migrated to Asia than to Africa.
Response:  We know that 18 families of birds live near the mountain and migrate to warmer areas during winter.  If 38 bird families have migrated to Africa and 80 bird families have migrated to Asia, then the total number of bird families that have migrated is:  38 + 80 = 118. Therefore, 118 bird families have migrated for the winter.
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain and now 18 new bird families have joined them. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is:  $87 + 18 = 105$ families.
Response:  We know that 49 families of birds live near the mountain during winter.  Then we are told that 59 bird families migrated to warmer areas for winter and 24 new bird families arrived at the mountain from Arctic regions. So, the number of bird families remaining nearby the mountain is:  Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated = 49 + (59 - 24) = 73 families. Therefore, there are 73 bird families remaining near the mountain after migration.
Response:  We know that 27 bird families migrated away from their original location near the mountain to go south for winter. This means that there are now fewer birds left in this area.  If initially, 41 bird families lived nearby the mountain, then after 27 families migrated away, there are only 14 bird families left nearby the mountain.
Response:  We know that in the beginning there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. Then we are told that 86 bird families migrated to warmer areas for winter. So, the total number of bird families living nearby the mountain at the start of winter is: 45 + 86 = 131. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that migrated and those that stayed behind is: 131 - 45 = 86.
Response:  We know that 35 p...ttle families are from the mountain and have migrated to Asia. So there are 41 - 35 = 8 more families of birds who live near the mountain and have not migrated anywhere. Now we need to find out how many of these 8 families have migrated to Africa. According to the problem, 62 families of birds have migrated to Africa. Therefore, the number of families of birds who have migrated to Africa is equal to 8 - 62 = -54 families. So, there are 54 fewer families of birds who have migrated to Africa than those who have migrated to Asia.
Response:  We know that:  * 26 new bird families have arrived near the mountain from the Arctic region.  * 2 bird families have migrated south for winter. So, the total number of bird families remaining near the mountain is:  Total = Existing + New - Migrated = 2 + 26 - 2 = 36 bird families.
Response:  At first, Pol had 253 boxes with toys for his birthday party. Then he lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, how many boxes will remain till the end of the academic year? To find out, we need to subtract the number of boxes that were lost or given away from the initial amount: 253 - 70 = 183 boxes. Therefore, 183 boxes will remain till the end of the academic year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Pol had 551 sweets in his box and he lost or gave away 374 of them until the end of the school year. So, he has 177 sweets left. To find out how many sweets Pol will get for his birthday, we need to divide the number of sweets he has left (177) by the number of days left until his birthday (90). Therefore, Pol will receive 2 sweets per day until his birthday.
Response:  If he gave away 111 moylas to his friends and lost 106, then he has 111 - 106 = 5 moylas left.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received $65 in gifts for his birthday and gave away 213 presents to his friends during the academic year. Therefore, the total number of presents he gave away is:

$$ Total = 213 - 16 = 197 $$
So, the number of presents that were either lost or given away is $197."
Response:  Firstly, we know that he gave away 589 boxes of sweets during his birthday celebration and lost 161 mo...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the boy has given away 90 moylas to his friends during the academic year and lost 412 moylas. Therefore, the difference between the number of moylas he gave away and the number he lost is: 90 - 412 = -322 moylas. So, the boy has lost 322 more moylas than he gave away to his friends.
Response:  We know that the number of chocolates Pol received from his friends is equal to the number of chocolates he gave away minus the number he lost. So, if he received 563 chocolates and gave away 558, then he must have lost 332 chocolates. Therefore, the number of chocolates he received for his birthday is 332.
Response:  We know that the total number of moylia given away is 52 + 535 = 587. Since he has only 492 left, we can deduce that some were lost or given away. So, the number of moylia lost or given away is 492 - 587 = -195. Therefore, out of the remaining 492 moylia, 195 were lost or given away.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Pol had 521 mollies and 66 gumballs in his jar. At the end of the year, he had 154 remaining without losing or giving away any gumballs. So, we can calculate how many gumballs were lost or given away as follows: Number of gumballs lost/given away = Total number of gumballs at the beginning of the year - Total number of gumballs at the end of the year Number of gumballs lost/given away = 66 - 154 = -88 Therefore, 88 gumballs were lost or given away during the year.
"Response:  We know that initially, Pol had 531 toys and 38 rubber bands. After he gave away some of his toys, he was left with 391 toys. Since he didn't lose any rubber bands, we can conclude that he has 38 rubber bands remaining. So, the number of more mollies than rubbers he has is:

$$ \text{Number of mollies} = \text{Initial mollies} - \text{Rubbers left} $$
= $531 - $38$
= $493$
Therefore, Pol has $493$ more mollies than rubbers he has."
Response:  We know that Pol received a box with 601 bullets and 406 rubber bands for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 336 remaining without losing any bullet or rubber band. So, we can calculate the number of rubber bands in the following way: Number of rubber bands = Total amount at the beginning - Amount left at the end = 406 - 336 = 70 Therefore, there are 70 rubber bands in the box.
Response:  We know that Pol has 291 rubles left until the end of the school year and he wants to buy a gift for his birthday. If he gives away 315 rubles, then he will have 291 - 315 = -84 rubles left. Therefore, Pol will not receive any money for his birthday.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that he has lost 231 molliwogs during the academic year and given away 308 to his friends. So, the difference between the number of molliwogs he has lost and those he has given away is:

231 - 308 = -177

Now, we are asked how many more molliwogs he gave away than he lost. To find this, we subtract the number he lost from the number he gave away:

308 - 231 = 77

Therefore, he gave away 77 more molliwogs than he lost."
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Pol had 457 tires and 320 bolts for his birthday. At the end of the year, he had 523 without losing any tire or bolt. So, we can calculate how many more mollies he got as follows: Number of mollies at the end of the year - Number of mollies at the beginning of the year = (523 - 457) + (320 - 0) = 66 + 320 = 386 Therefore, Pol gained 386 mollies during the year.
Response:  If the server had 11 clients and some of them left, he still has 3 clients remaining. So, the number of clients that left is equal to 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, 8 more clients remained than the initial amount.
Response:  The server had three clients initially. If some of them left, he still has 4 clients. So, the number of clients that left is equal to the number of clients he still has - 3 = x. Since the total number of clients who left is equal to the number of clients he still has, we can write: x + 3 = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. Therefore, one client remained with the server after some others left.
Response:  At first, there were 1 client (the servitor). Then, 9 clients left, leaving the servitor with 12 clients in total. So, at the beginning, the servitor had 1 client.
Response:  If one server had 14 clients and then 5 remained, that means there were initially 29 clients (14 + 5). So, the number of clients remaining is 29 - 5 = 24. Therefore, the correct answer is 24.
"Response:  At first, the server had 13 clients. Then, some of them left, so he gained 4 new clients. Therefore, the number of clients the server has now is:

13 - (some left) + 4 = 9

So, there are 9 clients remaining."
Response:  The server had 12 clients initially and then 15 of them left, leaving him with 14 new clients. So, the total number of clients he has now is: 12 + 14 = 26 clients.
Response:  At first, the server had three clients. Then, more clients arrived and he had eight clients in total. So, new clients arrived = 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, the server had 8 clients and then some left, so he had 5 clients remaining. Then, he got 99 new clients, which means he now has 104 clients (including the original 5). So, the number of clients that remained after all this is 5 + 104 = 109.
Response:  At first, the server had 12 clients and then some left, so he had less than 12 clients. Then, he received 10 new clients, which means he now has more clients than before. So, the final number of clients is greater than 12.  Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 12 clients.
Response:  If Dan had $3 after buying chocolate for $2, then he must have had $5 initially ($3 - $2 = $1). So, his initial amount of money was $5.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 after buying chocolate. So, he had $3 before buying chocolate (since he spent $4 - $3 = $1). Therefore, one chocolate bar costs $1.
Response:  Dan has $4.  He bought 99 chocolate bars for $3 each, so he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. So, he has $4 - $297 = $-293 left.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolate bars for $4. So, if each bar costs an equal amount of money, then we can say that each chocolate bar costs half of the total amount spent by Dan, which is $4 / 2 = $2 per bar. Therefore, each chocolate bar costs $2.
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 and he bought several chocolate bars for $6. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $2 = x + (x \* 3) where x is the number of chocolate bars Dan bought. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract $3 from both sides of the equation: $2 - ($3 \* x) = 0. Solving for x, we get: x = $2 / $3 = 2. Therefore, Dan bought 2 chocolate bars.
Response:  Dan has $7. He spends $2 for chocolate that costs $2. So he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then he buys another piece of chocolate that costs $3. So now he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.
Response:  Dan has $4. He buys a bonbon for $7 and chocolate for $6. So he spends a total of $13 ($7 + $6). Therefore, he spent $9 on the chocolate and $4 on the bonbon.
Response:  Dan has $2. He spent $6 for one chocolate bar and $3 for another chocolate bar. So he spent in total $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, Dan spent $9 for the chocolate bars, not $2.
Response:  Dan has $5 and spends $2 for one chocolate bar and $3 for another chocolate bar. So he spent a total of $5 + $2 = $7 on chocolates. Therefore, he spent $7 / 2 = $3.50 for the chocolate bar that costs $3, and $7 / 3 = $2.33 for the chocolate bar that costs $2.
Response:  Dan had $4 initially. He bought chocolate for $8, so he spent $8 - $4 = $4. Now his remaining balance is $4 + $5 = $9. So, he has $9 left.
Response:  If Dan had $3 after buying chocolate and he had $4 at the beginning, then he spent $3 + $4 = $7 on the chocolate. So, the cost of one chocolate bar is $7 / 1 = $7.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys 10 chocolate bars for $3 each. So he spends a total of $3 x 10 = $30. Therefore, he has $4 - $30 = $1 left.
Response:  Dan has $3 and he buys 2 chocolate bars for a total of $4. So, each bar costs half of the amount Dan has, or $\frac{4}{3} = \$1$.
Response:  Dan has $5. He spent $3 on chocolate for $3 and $7 on chocolate for $7, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, he spent $2 on chocolate.
Response:  Danyou has $4. So he spent $7 + $2 = $9 for the chocolate and bonbon. Therefore, he spent $9 / $4 = $2.25 for the chocolate, and $2.25 - $2 = $0.25 for the bonbon.
Response:  We know that Pol had 115 books initially. Then he sold 78 books at a garage sale. So, we need to find out how many books Pol has left after selling those 78 books. To do this, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had: 115 - 78 = 37. Therefore, Pol has 37 books left.
Response:  At first, Pol had several books. After selling 137 of them at a garage sale, he was left with 105 books. So, in the beginning, Pol had x books. Since he sold 137 books, we can write an equation: x - 137 = 105. Solving for x, we get: x = 205. Therefore, Pol had 205 books in the beginning.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 108 books and after selling some of them he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation: 108 - x = 62 where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 108: x = 62 / 108 = 6/10. Therefore, Pol sold 6 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 50 books. Then he bought some at a garage sale and after that, he had 151 books left. So, we can write an equation: 50 + x = 151 where x is the number of books Pol bought at the garage sale. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation: x = 101 Books. Therefore, Pol bought 101 books at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, Pol had two books. Then he sold some at a garage sale and bought 150 new ones. Now, if he has 58 books left, that means he sold 92 books (58 - 2 = 92).
Response:  Initially, Pol had 21 books. After selling some at a garage sale, he bought 42 new ones. So, now he has 42 + 21 = 63 books in total. Therefore, he sold more than he bought.
Response:  First, Pol had 71 books and sold some at a garage sale, so he had fewer books left. Then, he bought 38 new books, which means he now has more books than before (71 - x) + 38 = 116 where x is the number of books he sold. Solving for x, we get x = 45. So, Pol bought 45 more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 108 books and 55 chemistry sets. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he has 66 books and 59 chemistry sets left. So, we can write an equation:  Books = 108 - x Where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale. Similarly, for the chemistry sets: Chemistry Sets = 55 - y Where y is the number of chemistry sets sold at the garage sale. Now we need to find out how many books were sold at the garage sale. To do this, we will use the information given in the problem that after selling some of his things, Pol has 66 books left. Therefore, we can substitute the value of x in the first equation as follows: Books = 108 - 66 = 42 So, Pol sold 42 books at the garage sale. Finally, let's find out how many chemistry sets were sold at the garage sale using the second equation: Chemistry Sets = 55 - y = 59 Since y is already known (as per the problem), we can directly substitute it into the equation: Chemistry Sets = 55 - 59 = -4 Therefore, no chemistry sets were sold at the garge sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 106 chemistry sets and 51 books. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he has 82 books and 14 chemistry sets left. So, to find out how many chemistry sets Pol sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of chemistry sets he has now from the initial number: 106 - 14 = 92. Therefore, Pol sold 92 chemistry sets at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that the person sold some books at a garage sale and was left with 27 books. So initially he had 136 - 27 = 109 books. Therefore, he sold (109 - 27) = 82 books.
Response:  First, Pol had 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. So now he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then, he sold some books at a garage sale and ended up with 95 - x = 68 books where x is the number of books he sold at the garage sale. Since Pol had 68 books left after selling some at the garage sale, we can set up the equation: 95 - x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Pol sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 153 books and 95 chemistry sets. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 chemistry sets. So, to find out how many books were sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books after the sale = 153 - 13 = 140 books Therefore, Pol sold 140 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 143 books and 42 chemistry sets. So altogether he had 185 items (books + chemistry sets). Then, after selling some of them in the garage sale, he was left with 113 books and 19 chemistry sets. To find out how many chemistry sets were sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of chemistry sets he had left from the initial total: 19 - 42 = 23. Therefore, Pol sold 23 chemistry sets at the garage sale.
Response:  At first, there were 10 roses in the vase. Then Jessica took 8 more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are в total of roses in the vase.
Response:  In the beginning, Jessica had 16 rosi in the vase. Then she added another 16 roses from her garden, so now there are 32 roses in total (16 + 16). Finally, we are told that there are 23 roses in the vase, which means that 9 roses were removed (23 - 9 = 14). Therefore, there were initially 16 roses in the vase.
Response:  Firstly, there were two roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica took out four roses from the vase and added new ones she had cut from her garden, making it total of 28 roses (2 + 4). Finally, we are told that there are 23 roses in the vase now. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut from her garden, we need to subtract the number of roses in the vase after she added them from the initial number of roses in the vase: 23 - 2 = 21. Therefore, Jessica cut 21 roses from her garden.
Response:  First, there were 15 roses in the vase. Then Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and added some new ones from her garden to make it up to 17 roses again. So, the number of roses she added was 6 (17 - 15 = 6). Therefore, the number of roses she removed is equal to the number of roses she added, which is 6.
Response:  Firstly, there were 21 roses in the vase initially. Then Jessica took out 34 roses from the vase and added them to her garden. After that, she cut some more roses from her garden and put them into the vase, which resulted in 15 roses left in the vase. So, the number of roses Jessica actually removed from the vase is 34 - 21 = 13.
Response:  We know that in the vase there were initially 7 roses. Then Jessica picked more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, making the total number of roses 59. Finally, we are told that there are 20 roses left in the vase after Jessica took some away. So, if we subtract the number of roses remaining in the vase (20) from the total number of roses she picked (59), we get the number of roses Jessica cut: 59 - 20 = 39. Therefore, Jessica cut 39 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that in the vase there were initially 13 roses and Jessica removed 5 more from her garden, leaving 7 roses in the vase. So, the total number of roses in the vase is 13 + 7 = 20 roses. Since there are 21 roses in total, we can conclude that 1 rose remained in the garden. Therefore, the answer is 1 rose.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After this, there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, we can calculate how many roses Jessica removed as follows: Number of roses removed = Initial number of roses - Final number of roses = 15 - 17 = -2 roses Therefore, Jessica removed 2 roses from the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After this, there were 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, we can say that Jessica removed 2 roses and 2 orchids from the vase. Therefore, she has removed 2 orchids.
Response:  At first, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. After that, there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So, we can see that there are now more roses than orchids in the vase. Therefore, the number of rose is greater than the number of orchids in the vase right now.
Response:  At first, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. After that, there were 11 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. So, now there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase (20 - 11 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If Jessica had initially 3 roses in her garden and she cut 16 roses from it to put them into a vase, then we can conclude that she has cut 16 - 3 = 13 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After this, there are 91 orchids and 14 roses left in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses Jessica removed (14) from the total number of roses initially (13), we get the number of roses she cut - 13 - 14 = -1. Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After this, there were 7 orchids and 13 roses left in the vase. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica removed, we can subtract the number of orchids after she removed them (7) from the initial number of orchids (3): 3 - 7 = -4. Therefore, Jessica removed 4 orchids from the vase.
Response:  At first, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After that, there were 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, now there are 5 more roses than orchids in the vase (22 - 17 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  At first, there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica removed some more roses and orchids from her garden. After that, there were 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So, the number of orchids is now greater than the number of roses by 10 (13 - 3 = 10). Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
"Response:  We know that Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off several centimeters from it. So let's assume that she cut off x centimeters from her hair. Since we also know that the length of her new hair is now 13 inches, we can set up the equation:

x + 17 = 13... (1)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

x = 13 - 17... (2)

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = -4

So Robin cut off 4 centimeters from her original 17-inch long hair."
"Response:  Robin cut 20 inches off her hair. If her hair was currently 10 inches long, how long was it before she cut it? We know that the sum of the lengths of all the parts of a shape is equal to the perimeter of the shape. So if we let x be the length of Robin's hair before she cut it, then we can write:

x + (20 - x) = 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 30

Dividing both sides by 2, we find that:

x = 15

So Robin's hair was 15 inches long before she cut it."
Response:  At first, Robin's hair was 16 inches long and she cut off 30 centimeters (or 12 inches). So, her hair length reduced to 16 - 30 = 9 inches. Then, it grew back to 12 + 12 = 24 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 24 inches long.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and it grew an additional 18 inches, then her current length of hair would be: 19 + 18 = 37 inches.
Response:  Robin cut off 13 inches from her hair. If it was previously 14 inches long, then now it is shorter by 13 - 14 = 1 inch. So, Robin's hair is currently 1 inch shorter than before.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair was originally long for 14 inches. Then it grew by 8 inches. So, now her hair is 22 inches long (14 + 8). Finally, she cut off 20 inches, which means her current length of hair is 22 - 20 = 2 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long.
Response:  If Dan has 12 caps in his collection and he found 53 more in the park, then the total number of caps he has now is: 12 + 53 = 65. So, there are 65 caps in total that Dan has.
Response:  We know that Dan has 21 caps in his collection and he found more caps in the park. So, the total number of caps he found in the park is: 21 + x = 53 where 'x' is the number of additional caps he found in the park. Now, we need to find out what 'x' is. Since Dan already had 21 caps in his collection, the number of caps he found in the park must be equal to the difference between the total number of caps and the number of caps he already had: x = 53 - 21 = 32 Therefore, Dan found 32 additional caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 63 capuchins from bottles in the park and threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 capuchins in his collection. So, initially, Dan had 63 - 51 = 12 capuchins in his collection.
Response:  We know that Dan found 36 capaques in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 1 more capaque than he threw away. Therefore, the number of capaques Dan found in the park is 36 - 35 = 1.
Response:  We know that Dan found 30 caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones, so he has 30 + 63 = 93 caps in total. Now, he has 42 caps in his collection, which is less than the total number of caps he found or threw away, so we can conclude that he threw away more caps than he found. Therefore, the number of caps he threw away is 93 - 42 = 51 caps.
Response:  We know that Dan found 22 capuchins and 8 packages in the park initially. Now he has 28 capuchins and 63 packages in his collection. So, the number of capuchins Da...
Response:  At first, Dan had 22 capuchins and 30 packages in the park. Now he has 17 capuchins and 57 packages in his collection. So initially, Dan had 39 (22 + 30) packages.
Response:  We know that Dan found 30 capuchins and 14 packages in the park. Now he has 7 capuchins and 86 packages in his collection. To find out how many more capuchins he found in the park, we can subtract the number of capuchins he already had from the total number he found: 30 - 7 = 23. So, Dawn found 23 more capuchins in the park than he already had.
"Response:  We know that Dan found 11 capuchins and 28 packages in the park. Now he has 68 capuchins and 51 packages in his collection. To find out how many more packages than capuchins Dan found in the park, we need to subtract the number of packages he already had from the total number of packages he found:

Number of packages Dan found in the park - Number of packages he already had = 28 - 51 = -23
So, Dan found 23 more packages than capuchins in the park."
Response:  At first, Dan had 71 capuchins and 24 packages in the park. Now he has 28 capuchins and 16 packages in his collection. So initially, he had 71 + 24 = 95 capuchins and packages combined. Since now he has 28 capuchins and 16 packages, we can deduce that he must have given away or lost 71 - 28 = 43 capuchins and 24 - 16 = 8 packages. Therefore, Dan currently has 43 capuchins and 8 packages.
Response:  At first, Dan had 10 bottles and 62 packages in the park. Then he collected 27 caps and 43 packages from his collection. So, initially, he had 10 + 62 = 72 items. Now, he has 27 caps and 43 packages, which means he lost 72 - (27 + 43) = 28 packages. Therefore, Dan now has 43 more packages than bottles.
Response:  We know that Dan collected bottle caps and lost 66 of them in the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. So, initially, Dan had (25 - 66) = -41 bottle caps.
Response:  If Dan had 25 caps in his collection before he went to the park and found 17 more, then he now has 25 + 17 = 42 caps in his collection.
"Response:  At first, Dan had 100 bottle caps (since he started with ""дани"" which means ""Dan""). Then, he collected 58 new ones in the park, so now he has 100 + 58 = 158 bottle caps. Finally, he threw away 60 old ones, leaving him with 158 - 60 = 98 bottle caps. Therefore, Dan had 98 bottle caps at the beginning."
Response:  Dan collected bottle caps from his friends and family. He threw away 6 old ones in the park while looking for new ones to add to his collection. So he found 50 - 6 = 44 new bottle caps in the park. Therefore, Dan found 44 bottle caps in addition to the 6 that he threw away in the park.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 48 new caps from somewhere and threw away 54 old ones in the park. So, he has 48 + 54 = 102 caps in total now. Since there are 52 caps in his collection now, we can deduce that he threw away 10 - 52 = -39 caps. Therefore, Dan threw away -39 caps besides the ones he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Dan found 82 packaging and bottles in the park initially. Then he collected 42 caps and 61 packages from his collection. So, initially, Dan had 82 + 42 = 124 bottles and packages. Therefore, the answer is 124.
Response:  We know that Dan found 66 ointment packets and 39 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 16 capacks and 68 ointment packets in his collection. To find out how many ointment packets Dawn had at first, we can subtract the number of ointment packets she now has from the total number of ointment packets she found: 66 - 68 = -2. So, Dawn had 68 ointment packets in the beginning.
"Response:  We know that Dan found 46 packaging and 50 caps in the park. Now he has 21 caps and 52 packages in his collection. To find out how many more caps he found in the park than he currently has, we can subtract the number of caps he currently has from the total number of caps he found:

Number of additional caps = Total number of caps found - Current number of caps
= 50 - 21
= 29

So, Dan found 29 more caps in the park than he currently has."
"Response:  We know that Dan found 65 packages and caps in the park. Now he has 31 caps and 9 packages in his collection. To find out how many more packages than caps he found in the park, we need to subtract the number of packages he has now from the original number of packages he found:

65 - 9 = 56
So, Dan found 56 more packages than caps in the park."
Response:  At first, Dan had 58 capuchins and 25 packages in the park. Now he has 11 packages and 12 capuchins in his collection. So initially, he had 58 + 25 = 83 capuchins and packages combined. Since now he has 11 packages, he must have collected 83 - 11 = 72 capuchins. Therefore, Dan currently has 72 capuchins for bottles.
Response:  At first, Dan had 15 capuchins and 18 packages in the park. Now he has 67 package and 35 capuchin in his collection. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = 18 + 67 = 85 Number of capuchins = 35 + 15 = 50 Therefore, there are 35 more packages than capuchins in Dan's collection now.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer pranks than Stephen. So if Jake has 17 pranks, then Stephen must have 28 pranks (17 - 11 = 16).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prunes than Stephen, who has more than Gill. So, if we assume that Jake has x prunes, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Jake has x prunes, and he has 7 less than Stephen, so Stephen has x + 7 prunes.
We also know that Stephen has 14 more prunes than Gill, so Gill has x - 14 prunes.
Now, let's substitute the values of x = 9 (since Jake has 9 prunes) and x - 14 = 5 (since Gill has 5 prunes):

So, Jake has 9 prunes."
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 prawns less than Stephen, who has 13 more than Gill. So, if we subtract 18 from Stephen's number of prawns, we get:  Stephen has 19 prawns. Therefore, Gill has 19 - 13 = 6 prawns.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prunes than Stephen, who has 8 more than Gill. So, if we write it down like this:
Jake - 3 < Stephen - 8 + Gill = x, where ""x"" is the number of prunes that Gill has. Now, we can solve for ""x"". Since Stephen has 8 more than Gill, that means Gill has x/2 prunes. And since Jake has 3 less than Stephen, Jake has (x/2) - 3 = 5 prunes. Therefore, Jake has 5 more prunes than Dill."
Response:  We know that: * Jake has 12 fewer pranks than Stephen, who has 11 more than Gill. * Stephen has 4 pranks. So we can write an equation: Jake - 12 = Stephen + 11 - 4 Now let's solve for Dill: Dill = Jake - 12 + 4 = 9 So Dill has 9 more pranks than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pranks than Stephen and more than Gill. So, we can start with Jake's number of pranks as less than or equal to Stephen's.  Therefore, Jake's number of pranks is between 7 and 16 (inclusive). Since Jake has 9 more pranks than Gill, we can say that Jake's number of pranks is 9 + x, where x is the difference between 7 and 16. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Jake has 9 prawns.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer prawns than Stephen and 8 more than Gill. So, if we subtract 7 from Stephen's number of prawns (17), we get Jake's number of prawns: 10. Now, we know that Gill has 8 more prawns than Jake, so Gill has 10 + 8 = 18 prawns. Therefore, Dill has 18 prawns.
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 less than Stephen and 18 more than Gill. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake = Stephen - 9 + 18 (Gill)  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Jake = 16 + 18 (Gill)  Substituting Gill's value of 9, we get:  Jake = 16 + 18 x 9  Simplifying, we get:  Jake = 34  Therefore, STEVEN has 34 more prawns than GILL.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prunes than Stephen. So, if Jake has x prunes, then Stephen has x + 18 prunes. Since Dil has 5 prunes, we can say that Jake has x - 5 prunes. Therefore, Jake has 6 prawns less than Stephen.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prunes than Stephen. So, if Jake has x prunes, then Stephen has x + 18 prunes. Now we are told that Diane has 87 more prunes than Jake. Therefore, the number of prunes Jake has is equal to the number of prunes Diane has minus 87. So, Jake has 87 - x = 87 - (x + 18) prunes. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 69. Hence, Jake has 69 prunes less than Stephen.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pranks than Stephen and more pranks than Gill. So, we can write an inequality based on this information:

Jake has fewer pranks than Stephen, so |Jake| < |Stephen|
Jake has more pranks than Gill, so |Jake| > |Gill|

We also know that Gill has 12 pranks, so we can set up another inequality:

|Gill| = 12

Now, let's solve for the difference between Jake and Gill:

|Jake| - |Gill| = |Jake| - 12
= |Jake| - |Gill|

Simplifying the equation, we get:

|Jake| - |Gill| = 9

So, Jake has 9 more pranks than Gill. Therefore, the answer is:

Jake has 9 more pranks than Gill."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Stephen and more apples than him. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: 12 - 12 = 0 (no pears)
Jake: 79 + 79 = 158 (more apples than Stephen)
Stephen: 19 + 14 = 33 (has 33 pears and 14 apples)
Now, let's find out how many pears Jake has:
Since Jake has fewer pears than Stephen, he must have at least 33 - 12 = 21 pears. Therefore, Jake has 21 pears."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Stephen and more apples than him. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: 13 - 3 = 10 apples; 13 - 4 = 9 pears
Stephen: 9 - 2 = 7 pears; 8 + 3 = 11 apples
Now, let's see how many apples Jake has: 10 (apples) + 11 (apples) = 21 apples
So, Jake has 21 apples!"
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer prunes than Stephen and more apricots. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: 6 prunes - 8 apricots = 2 apricots less than Stephen
Stephen: 17 prunes + 16 apricots = 33 apricots more than Jake
Now, let's find out how many more apricots Stephen has than Jake:
33 apricots (more than Jake) = x apricots (less than STEVEN)
We can set up an equation using this information:
6prunes - 8apricots = 33apricots - xapricots
Simplifying the equation, we get:
4prunes = 25apricots - xapricots
Solving for x, we get:
x = 29apricots
So, Steven has 29 more apricots than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pears than Stephen and 10 more apples than Stephen. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:

Jake has 3(pears) - 10(apples) =?

We also know that Stephen has 12 pears and 15 apples. So, we can substitute these values into our equation to solve for the number of apples that Stephen has:

Jake has 3(12) - 10(15) =?

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Jake has 36 - 150 = -114

So, STEVEN HAS 114 MORE APPLES THAN JAKE."
Response:  We know that:  • Стивън has 12 prawns.  • Джейк has fewer than Стивън, who has 67 more than Gill. So, we can write an inequality based on these statements: 12 > x (where x is the number of prawns that Jeff has) Since we want to find out how many prawns Jeff has, we need to solve for x in this inequality. To do so, we divide both sides of the inequality by 12: x < 67 Now we have found that Jeff has less than 67 prawns. Therefore, the answer is:  Jeff has 59 prawns.
"Response:  We know that:
Steven has 18 pranks.
Jake has fewer than Steven and more than Gillian, who has 8 less than Steven.
So, Jake has 12 - 8 = 4 prawns.
Gillian has 8 prawns."
Response:  We know that Стивън has 19 prawns and Dжиl has 72 more than Jake. So, if we add the number of prawns that Jake has to the number of prawns that Dжиl has, we will get the total number of prawns that Jake has. Therefore, the answer is 19 + 72 = 91.
"Response:  We know that:
Steven has 14 pranks.
Jake has fewer than Steven and more than Gill.
Gill has x pranks.
We can write an equation based on this information:
14 - J = x + 3
Where J is the number of pranks that Jake has.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
14 - 6 = x + 3
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So Gill has 7 pranks."
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 84 walnuts and fewer than 10 pears than Stephen. So, if we subtract 10 from Jake's total number of nuts (walnuts), he will have 74 walnuts left. Now, let's see how many pears Stephen has. According to the problem statement, Stephen has 13 pears. Therefore, Jake must have 61 pears (74 - 13 = 61).
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has more than 13 apples and fewer than 17 pears than Stephen.
Stephen has 8 pears and 12 apples.
So, Jake must have at least 13 + 12 = 25 apples.
Therefore, Jake has 25 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steve and more apples than Steve. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake: 8 pears - 10 apples = 2 apples less than Steve
Steve: 11 apples + 18 pears = 7 pears more than Jake
Now, let's find out how many more pears Steve has than Jake:
Steve's pear count - Jake's pear count = 7 (pairs)
So, Steve has 7 more pairs of pears than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Stephen. So, if Jake has x pears, then Stephen has x + 4 jars. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Jake has 3 less pears than Stephen, so:
x = 3 - (x + 4)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So, Steven has 7 more jars of jam than Jake."
Response:  Olivia had $78 in her portfolio and spent $15 at the supermarket. So, she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 in the supermarket and has $33 left, then she must have had $101 initially (since $33 is the remaining amount after spending $78).
Response:  At first, Olivia had $100 in her portfolio. Then she took out another $148 from the bank, so now she has a total of $248. After visiting the supermarket, she spent $159, leaving her with $97 ($248 - $159).
"Response: 
Olivia had $3 in her purse initially. She took out another $49 from the bank, so she now has $52 ($3 + $49).
After visiting the supermarket, she spent $49, leaving her with $6 ($52 - $49 = $6). Therefore, Olivia gained $6 more than what she spent at the supermarket."
"Response: 
Olivia had $53 in her purse and took out another $91 from the bank. So she had a total of $144 ($53 + $91). After visiting the supermarket, she was left with $14 ($144 - $128 = $14). Therefore, Olivia spent more money at the supermarket than she collected from the bank ($128 - $91 = $37)."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her portfolio initially. After visiting the supermarket and store, she was left with $26. So, if she spent $49 at the art gallery, she must have spent more than $26 at the supermarket. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $75 ($49 + $26).
Response:  After Olivia visited the supermarket and spent $29, she had $54 - $29 = $25 left in her wallet.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 in the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet, then she must have had $90 left after buying something ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  Dave had 19 applications on his phone initially. If he deleted 5 of them, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone. So, Dave has 14 applications on his phone now.
Response:  At first, Dave had several applications on his phone. After he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5. So, in the beginning, Dave had 18 applications on his phone.
Response:  Dave had 10 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 11 new ones. After deleting some of them, there were four left. So, if we subtract the number of applications that were already on his phone (10) from the total number of applications he had (including both old and new ones), we get: $10 - 10 = 0$. Therefore, Dave deleted zero applications.
Response:  Dave had 21 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 89 new applications, so the total number of applications became 89 + 21 = 106. After deleting some of them, there were 24 applications left. So, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number he deleted is 106 - 24 = 82. Therefore, Dave added 82 more applications than he deleted.
Response:  Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially. Then he added 71 new applications. After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, we can say that: Number of applications Dave deleted = Number of applications he added - 15 (initial number) = 71 - 15 = 56 Therefore, Dave deleted 56 more applications than he added.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. If he deleted some of them, then afterward, he had 5 applications and 23 files left. To find out how many applications were deleted, we can divide the number of remaining applications (5) by the initial number of applications (16): 5/16 = 0.3125. Since there are no remainders in division, round this fraction to the nearest whole number: 0.31 = 3. So, Dave deleted 3 applications from his phone. Similarly, to find out how many files were deleted, we can divide the number of remaining files (23) by the initial number of files (77): 23/77 = 0.3094. Again, rounding to the nearest whole number gives us: 0.31 = 3. Therefore, Dave deleted 3 files from his phone as well.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 files and applications on his phone initially. If he deleted some of them, then he has fewer files and applications now. So, we can say that he deleted x files and y applications. Since he has 3 applications left, x + y = 3. Also, since he has 7 files left, x - y = 7. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 4 and y = 5. Therefore, Dave deleted 4 files and 5 applications from his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, the number of applications on Dave's phone is 21.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and files on his phone initially.  After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, we can say that the number of files exceeded the number of applications by 9 (15 - 6 = 9). Therefore, there are more files than applications on Dave's phone.
Response:  Dave had 17 applications on his phone initially. When he added more, there were 18 applications in total. So, he must have added 1 application to his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 15 applications and 59 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. To find out how many apps Dave deleted, we can divide the number of remaining apps (12) by the initial number of apps (15): 12 / 15 = 0.8. So, Dave deleted 7 apps. Similarly, to find out how many files Dave deleted, we can divide the number of remaining files (30) by the initial number of files (59): 30 / 59 = 0.5. So, Dave deleted 2 files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 17 applications and 21 files left. To find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of files after from the number of files before: 21 - 21 = 0. So, no files were deleted.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone initially.  After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of applications on Dave's phone is 12.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files more than applications is:  24 - 2 = 22 files more than applications.
Response:  Nel has 242 baseball cards and gives 136 of them to Jeff. So, the number of cards that Nel has left is: 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, Nel has 106 baseball cards left.
Response:  Nel initially had 301 baseball cards. She gave 301 of them to Jeff and now has 154 remaining. So, Nel initially had 301 baseball cards.
Response:  Nel had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff, so she now has 252 cards left. If Jeff had 11 cards initially, then he got 416 cards from Nel (528 - 11 = 416). So, Nel gave Jeff 416 cards.
Response:  Nel has 566 cards and gives some to Jeff. Now she has 535 cards. So, Jeff had 234 cards before he got any from Nel. Therefore, Jeff now has 234 + (535 - 566) = 234 + (-130) = 364 cards.  Thus, Jeff has 364 cards now.
"Response:  We know that Nel had 309 baseball cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now, he has 415 baseball cards in total (including those given to Jeff). So, the number of baseball cards Nel had after giving some to Jeff is:

415 - 309 = 106

Therefore, Nel had 106 baseball cards left after giving some to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Nel had 246 baseball cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 404 baseball cards in total (including the ones she kept). So, the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her initial number of cards and the current number of cards she has: 404 - 246 = 158. Since each card has 10 copies, the total number of non-baseball cards she gave to Jeff is 158 x 10 = 1580. Therefore, the number of extra non-baseball cards Nele has now is 495 - 1580 = -1070. So, Nele has 10 fewer non-baseball cards than she started with.
"Response:  We know that Nel had 573 baseball cards and gave some to John (195). So, she has 378 cards left. Now, we are told that she gave ""several"" more to Jeff. Since ""several"" is not a specific number, let's assume it means 10 cards. Therefore, Nel gave Jeff 10 + 195 = 205 cards in total."
Response:  Nel had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 55 baseball cards and 178 basketball cards. So, the number of baseball cards that Nel had is equal to the number of baseball cards that she doesn't have now minus the number of baseball cards that she gave to Jeff.  Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nel had is:  Number of baseball cards that Nel had = Number of baseball cards that she doesn't have now - Number of baseball cards that she gave to Jeff  In this case, the number of baseball cards that Nel didn't have now is 178 (since she has 55 baseball cards now), and the number of baseball cards that she gave to Jeff is 18 (since she gave 18 basketball cards to Jeff).  Therefore, the number of baseball cards that Nel had is:  Number of baseball cards that Nel had = 178 - 18 = 160  So, Nel had 160 baseball cards before giving any to Jeff.
Response:  Nel had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 376 cards with 10 points or more, which means she must have at least 376 - 239 = 137 baseball cards left. Since each card is worth 10 points, Nel now has 137 x 10 = 1370 points from her baseball cards alone.  As for the basketball cards, Nel initially had 239 of them, and after giving some to Jeff, she has 376 - 239 = 137 basketball cards left. So, Nel gained 137 - 10 = 127 additional points from her basketball cards as well. Therefore, Nel gained a total of 1370 + 127 = 1500 points from both sets of cards combined.
Response:  Paco started with 19 biscuits and then he had 35 left after eating some of them. So, initially, there were 35 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 biscuits and he took some of them. So, let's assume that he took x biscuits. Then, we have:  Number of biscuits left = 28 - x. Since there are 7 biscuits left, we can write:  x = 21. Therefore, Paco took 21 biscuits.
Response:  Initially, Paco had 40 biscuits. He took two of them, so he has 38 left. Then, he bought 37 more biscuits. So, in total, Paco now has 38 + 37 = 75 biscuits. Therefore, there are 75 biscuits left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 25 biscuits and he ate 5 of them. So now he has 25 - 5 = 20 biscuits left. Then, he bought 3 more biscuits. Now he has 20 + 3 = 23 biscuits in total. Therefore, he will eat more than the ones he originally had (20) plus the new ones he bought (3), so the answer is 23 - 20 = 3 more biscuits.
Response:  Paco has 13 biscuits and eats 2 of them. Now he has 13 - 2 = 11 biscuits left. To buy more biscuits, he buys 36 additional ones. So, in total, Paco has 11 + 36 = 47 biscuits.
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 biscuits and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 biscuits left. Then, he gave 13 biscuits to his friend, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 biscuits left. Therefore, there are 22 biscuits left for Paco.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 biscuits and given 13 of them to his friend. So, he still has 4 biscuits left (17 - 13 = 4). Now, let's calculate how many more biscuits Paco has eaten than those he gave away:  Number of biscuits Paco ate = 17 - 13 = 4 Number of biscuits Paco gave away = 13 Therefore, the difference between the number of biscuits Paco ate and those he gave away is 4 - 13 = -9. So, Paco has eaten 9 more biscuits than those he gave away.
Response:  Paco has 12 biscuits and eats 16 of them. So he has 12 - 16 = -4 biscuits left. Then, he gives 21 biscuits to his friend. So, his friend gets 21 + (-4) = 17 biscuits in total. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 17 more biscuits than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had 22 sweet and 75 salty biscuits initially. If he took 15 sweet biscuits, then he has 22 - 15 = 6 sweet biscuits left. Similarly, if he took 54 salty biscuits, then he has 75 - 54 = 21 salty biscuits left. So, the number of sweet biscuits Paco has is 6, and the number of salty biscuits he has is 21. Therefore, the total number of biscuits Paco has is 6 + 21 = 27 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Paco had 6 salty biscuits initially. After he ate 36 sweet biscuits, he had 9 + 36 = 45 sweet biscuits in total. Since he also ate 3 salty biscuits after eating the sweet ones, we can conclude that he has 45 - 3 = 42 sweet biscuits left. Therefore, the number of salty biscuits Paco has is 6 - 3 = 3.
Response:  We know that Paco had 37 sweet biscuits and 11 salty biscuits. If he took 5 sweet biscuits and 2 salty biscuits, then we have: Sweet biscuits = 37 - 5 = 32 Salty biscuits = 11 + 2 = 13 Therefore, there are 32 more sweet biscuits than salty biscuits. So, the number of sweet biscuits is 32 more than the number of salty biscuits.
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet biscuits and 6 salty biscuits initially. If he took out 20 sweet biscuits, then he has 8 - 20 = 6 sweet biscuits left. Similarly, if he took out 34 salty biscuits, then he has 6 + 34 = 40 salty biscuits left. So, there are 40 more salty biscuits than sweet biscuits left after Paco took some out. Therefore, the number of salty biscuits is 40 more than the number of sweet biscuits.
Response:  Paco initially had 37 biscuits and ate 36 of them. So, the number of biscuits left with Paco is: 37 - 36 = 1.
Response:  Paco had 36 biscuits and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 biscuits left. Then, he ate 10 biscuits. So, he has 22 - 10 = 12 biscuits left. Therefore, there are 12 biscuits left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 41 biscuits and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 biscuits left. Then, he ate 18 biscuits, so now he has 32 - 18 = 14 biscuits left. Therefore, Paco gave away 9 biscuits and ate 18, so there are 9 + 18 = 27 more biscuits than those he originally had.
Response:  Paco had 6 biscuits and gave 30 to his friend. So, he has 6 - 30 = -24 biscuits left. Then, he ate 23 biscuits. Therefore, the number of biscuits he gave to his friend is 30 - 23 = 7 more than the number of biscuits he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco had 34 sour biscuits and he gave away 15 of them. So, now he has 34 - 15 = 19 sour biscuits left.  Now, we also know that for each sour biscuit, Paco received 2 sweet biscuits. Since he gave away 15 sour biscuits, he received 15 x 2 = 30 sweet biscuits. Therefore, Paco has 19 + 30 = 49 sweet biscuits left.  So, the number of sweet biscuits Paco has is 49.
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 solen biscuits and 17 sweet ones. He ate 14 sweets and 9 solens. So, if he ate 9 solens, then he has 26 - 9 = 17 solen biscuits left. Therefore, Paco has 17 solen biscuits left.
Response:  Paco had 39 sweet and 6 salty biscuits initially. He ate 23 salty biscuits and 32 sweets. So, he has left with 39 - 23 = 16 sweet biscuits. Therefore, there are 16 more sweet biscuits than salty ones left with Paco.
Response:  Paco had 25 solen bi...
Response:  The birthday girl received $7 for her birthday and spent some money, leaving her with $5. So, she spent $\$5 - \$7 = \$2$.
Response:  Gwen received $8 for her birthday and spent $8, so she has $6 left. Therefore, Gwen received $6 for her birthday.
Response:  First, she received $2 from her mom for her birthday. Then, her dad gave her an additional $4. So far, she has $6. Next, she spent $3 on something. Now, she has $3 left. Therefore, she has $3 + $6 = $9 in total.
Response:  Guen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, so she got a total of $13 ($8 + $5). If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Guen received more money from her mom than from her dad.
Response:  Firstly, Guen received $3 from her mother for her birthday. Then, her father gave her an additional $6. So, in total, Guen received $9 ($3 + $6). Now, let's see how much she spent. According to the question, Guen spent $4. Therefore, we can calculate that Guen received $9 - $4 = $5 more from her father than she spent.
Response:  Guen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother for her birthday. She spent $4. So, she got more money from her mother than from her father. Therefore, the difference between the amount of money Guen received from her mother and the amount she received from her father is: $7 - $5 = $2. So, Guen received $2 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Guen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she has a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she has $1 left with her. So, Guen received more money from her father than from her mother. The difference between the two amounts is $1 ($7 - $6 = $1). Therefore, Guen received $1 more from her father than from her mother.
Response:  Josh had 9 topcoats in his collection and lost some of them. If he now has 4 topcoats, then he must have lost at least 5 topcoats (since he started with 9). So, Josh lost 5 topcoats.
Response:  Josh had several marbles in his collection and lost 21 of them. If he has 12 marbles left now, that means he had 12 + 21 = 33 marbles initially. So, Josh has 33 marbles in his collection now.
Response:  Josh had 19 topcoats in his collection and lost 11 of them. So he has 19 - 11 = 8 left. Then, he found 5 new ones. Therefore, he now has 8 + 5 = 13 topcoats in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 4 toy balls in his collection initially. If he lost 16 toy balls and found 8 new ones, then the total number of toy balls he has now is: 4 + 8 = 12. So, he has 12 toy balls left in his collection after losing 16 and finding 8 new ones.
Response:  Josh had 7 tops in his collection and lost 8 of them. So he has 7 - 8 = -1 tops left. Then, he found 10 new tops, so he gained 10 + 1 = 11 more tops than he initially had. Therefore, the number of tops he found is 11 - (-1) = 12 more tops than he initially had.
Response:  Josh had 21 toy cars in his collection and found 7 of them. So, he has 21 - 7 = 14 toy cars left in his collection now.
Response:  Josh had 20 topcoats in his collection and gave 2 to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 topcoats left.
Response:  Josh had 22 toy cars in his collection initially. Then Jack gave him 20 more toy cars. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 toy cars in his collection.
"Response:  Josh lost 11 tops. If he had 19 tops before, then after losing 11, he has:

$$ 19 - 11 = 8 $$

So, Josh now has 8 tops in his collection."
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 tops in his collection. Then he found 13 more tops and lost 5 tops. So, now he has 22 + 13 - 5 = 20 tops in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 15 toy cars in his collection and found 9 more. So he now has 15 + 9 = 24 toy cars in total. However, he lost 23 toy cars, so he actually has 24 - 23 = 1 toy car left in his collection. Therefore, Josh lost 23 toy cars more than he found.
Response:  At first, Josh had 3 tops in his collection. Then he found 6 more tops. So, now he has 3 + 6 = 9 tops in total. But then he lost 5 tops, so he has 9 - 5 = 4 tops left. Therefore, Josh found more tops than he lost by 4 tops.
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together collected 8 pounds of mushrooms (4 + 19 = 23). Now we need to find out how much heavier Marcos' mushrooms were compared to those of his father. To do this, we divide the weight of Marcos' mushrooms by the total weight of their collection: 23 / 23 = 1. Therefore, Marcos' mushrooms were 1 times heavier than those of his father.
"Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together collected 35 pounds of mushrooms. Marcos had 13 pounds of mushrooms himself. So, we can calculate how much more weight there are in Marcos' father's mushrooms than in Marcos' own mushrooms as follows:

Weight of Marcos' father's mushrooms = Total weight of mushrooms - Weight of Marcos' mushrooms
= 35 pounds - 13 pounds
= 22 pounds

Therefore, Marcos' father's mushrooms weigh 22 pounds more than Marcos' mushrooms."
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together collected 20 pounds of mushrooms. His fathers mushrooms weighed 17 pounds. So, if they collected together 20 pounds, then Marcos' share must be equal to 20 - 17 = 3 pounds. Therefore, Marcos' mushrooms weigh 3 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to gather berries. The weight of Marco's berries is 8 pounds, while his father's are 32 pounds. So, we can write an equation: 8 = x / 4 where x is the weight of his father's berries. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 32 / 4 = 8 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's berries is 8 pounds, and the weight of his father's berries is also 8 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together collected jars weighing around 7 kg (15.4 lbs). On their way back, Marco lost 4 kg of jars due to hunger. Therefore, the weight of the remaining jars belonging to Marcos is 3 kg or 6.6 lbs. So, the weight of jars belonging to Marcos' father is 7 - 4 = 3 kg or 6.6 lbs.
Response:  The total weight of jars gathered by Marcos and his father is 10 kg (as stated in the problem). Since Marcos alone has 4 kg of jars left, we can calculate how much his father had initially. Therefore, his father had 6 kg of jars at first (10 - 4 = 6).
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father together collected 52 pounds of mushrooms (22 + 30 = 52). Now, let's find out how much do Marcos mushrooms weigh now. According to the problem, Marcos mushrooms weight 36 pounds. So, the total weight of all mushrooms collected is equal to the sum of weights of Marcos mushrooms and his fathers mushrooms: 52 + 36 = 88 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marcos mushrooms is 36 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marcos yogurt weighs 5 kg and together with his father's yogurt, they weigh around 10 kg. So, if Marcos' yogurt weighs 5 kg, then his father's yogurt must weigh 5 kg + 5 kg = 10 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marcos' father's yogurt is 10 kg.
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father together have collected 30 pounds of mushrooms. If their combined weight is 17 pounds, then Marcos' share must be 30/2 = 15 pounds. So, Marcos' mushrooms are 5 pounds heavier than those of his father.
Response:  We know that Marcos yogurt weighs 4 kg and his father's yogurt weighs 26 pounds. To find out how much more weighty his father's yogurt is than Marcos', we can divide 26 by 4:  So, Marcos' yogurt weighs 6.5 times less than his father's yogurt.
Response:  We know that Marcos father and he went to gather berries together. The weight of his fathers berries is 4 kilograms. If together their berries weigh 30 pounds, then the weight of Marcos berries is: 30/2 = 15 kg (kilograms) So, Marcos berries weigh 15 kilograms.
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, several more children got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus now is 10 - 2 = 8 more than before the stop. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children in the bus. Then, another 38 children got on the bus at the next stop. So, now we have a total of 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  Before the stop, there were already some children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus before the stop is: $40$ (given). After the stop, two more children got on the bus, so the total number of children in the bus now is: $42$ (including the two new children). Therefore, the number of children in the bus before the stop was: $$ \boxed{40} $$
Response:  At first, there were 43 children in the bus. Then, several children got off from the bus at a stop. After that, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, the number of children who got off from the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children, i.e., 43 - 21 = 22. Therefore, 22 children got off from the bus at the stop.
Response:  Before the stop (spirkata), there were 41 children in the bus. During the stop, some of them got off the bus, so let's say x children left the bus. Now, there are 18 children left in the bus. To find out how many more children were in the bus before the stop than now, we can subtract the number of children who left from the initial number: 41 - x = 18. Solving for x, we get x = 23. So, there were 23 more children in the bus before the stop than there are now.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them got off the bus at a stop, leaving 11 children inside the bus. Finally, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number to 16. So, the number of children who boarded the bus at the stop is 5 (11 - 10 = 5).
Response:  At first, there were 5 children in the bus. Then, 63 children got off the bus and 2 or 3 more children got on it. So, the total number of children in the bus at that moment is: 5 + (63 - 5) = 68 children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 68 - 5 = 63 children.
Response:  At first, there were 36 children in the bus. Then, 68 children got off the bus, leaving 74 (36 + 68) children inside the bus. Finally, some more children boarded the bus, making its current number of passengers 12 (74 - 68). So, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who boarded is 56 (68 - 12).
Response:  At first, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 40 children got off the bus and 2 children stayed in the bus. So, initially, there were 22 + 40 = 62 children in total. Now, we need to find out how many children got off the bus at the stop. We know that the number of children who got off is equal to the number of children who stayed in the bus minus the number of children who were already off the bus before reaching the stop. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the stop is: 62 - (2 + 40) = 62 - 42 = 20 children. So, 20 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus. Then, 82 children got into the bus while 44 children left it (since there are 82 - 44 = 38 more children who entered the bus than those who left it). Therefore, the final number of children in the bus is 28 + 38 = 66 children. So, the difference between the number of children who entered and left the bus is 66 - 44 = 22 children.
Response:  At first, there were 23 children in the bus. Then, 24 more children got into the bus while some others got off. So, the total number of children in the bus at that time was 23 + 24 = 47. Now, we are asked how many more children got off than got on. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 8 (the number of children who got off - the number who got on). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  If the baker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now, we need to find out how many more tarts Baker has than the ones he sold. To do this, we divide the number of tarts he has left (82) by the number of tarts he sold (51): 82 / 51 = 1.6. So, Baker has 1.6 times as many tarts as he sold.
"Response:  We know that the baker made 54 tarts and sold some of them. To find out how many he sold, we can use the information given in the question: ""He sold some of them."" So, let's assume that he sold x tarts. Now, we have the total number of tarts the baker made minus the number of tarts he sold: 54 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get: x = 41. Therefore, the baker sold 41 tarts. As for Baker, he has 13 tarts left."
Response:  If he sold 145 tarts and has 72 left, then he must have made at least 145 + 72 = 217 tarts in total.
"Response:  If the baker has made 155 tarts and his friend has bought 140 of them, then the number of tarts left with the baker is:

155 - 140 = 15

So, there are 15 tarts left with the baker."
Response:  The baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them. This means he has 16 (121 - 105) tarts left. Then, he bought 170 new tarts. So, in total, he has 336 (16 + 170) tarts.
Response:  The baker made 13 tarts and sold 91 of them. So he has 13 - 91 = 78 remaining tarts. Then, he bought 154 new tarts. Therefore, the number of tarts that Baker Bought is equal to the number of tarts he already had minus the ones he sold plus the new ones he bought: 78 + 0 = 78 (since he didn't sell any new tarts) + 154 = 232. So, Baker bought 232 more tarts than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new tarts. Now he has 63 tarts left (92 - 31 = 63). Therefore, Baker Becker sold more tarts than the ones he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 tarts in total and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 more tarts left. Then, he made another 76 tarts. Now, he has 35 + 76 = 111 tarts altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Baker made 144 tarts and sold 71 of them. So, he had 73 remaining tarts (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made another 111 tarts. Therefore, the total number of tarts that Baker has made is equal to the number of tarts he sold plus the new ones he made: 73 + 111 = 184. So, Bake...
Response:  If the baker made 149 tarts and 91 cakes, then he has a total of 230 pastries (149 + 91 = 230).  If he sold 10 tarts and 90 cakes, then he has left with 220 pastries (230 - 10 - 90 = 220). So, there will be 220 tarts remaining at the bakery after selling 10 tarts and 90 cakes.
"Response:  The baker has made 7 tarts and 148 sweets in total. If he sells 15 tarts and 103 sweets, then the number of sweets left with the baker is:

Number of sweets left = Total number of sweets - Number of sweets sold
= 148 - (15 + 103)
= 148 - 118
= 30

So, there will be 30 sweets left with the baker after he sells 15 tarts and 103 sweets."
Response:  We know that Bakeer has sold 115 tarts and 81 scones. So, he has 39 more tarts than scones (115 - 81 = 34). Therefore, Baker has baked 34 more tarts than scones.
Response:  We know that the baker made 19 tarts and 131 sweets in total. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 sweets, then we can calculate how many more sweets the baker made as follows: Number of sweets left = Total number of sweets - Sold sweets = 131 - (70 + 88) = 53 Therefore, the baker made 53 more sweets than he sold.
Response:  According to the question, Peckarata made 157 tortes and 169 sweets. If he sold 158 tortes and 147 sweets, then Baker sold more tortes than Peckarata. So, the difference between the number of tortes sold by Baker and Peckarata is 158 - 157 = 1 torte. Therefore, Baker sold 1 torte more than Peckarata.
Response:  According to the question, the baker made 54 tarts and 143 sweets in total. If he sold 68 tarts and 92 sweets, then he sold more sweets than tarts. So, Bake...
Response:  If he sold 44 tarts initially and then added 4 more, he will have 44 + 4 = 48 tarts in total. So, there will be 48 tarts left after selling 4 more.
Response:  If Baker sold 8 tarts and initially made 40 tarts, then he has 32 extra tarts that he did not sell (40 - 8 = 32). So, Beaker has sold 8/32 of the total number of tarts he initially made. Therefore, Beaker has sold 8 x 32 / 40 = 16 additional tarts compared to those he initially made.
"Response:  If the friend of the baker buys 137 tarts from him and there were initially 169 tarts, then we can calculate how many tarts are left as follows:

Initially, there were 169 tarts.
The friend bought 137 tarts.
So, the number of tarts left = Initial quantity - Amount sold = 169 - 137 = 32 tarts."
Response:  The baker made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones. If he sold 86, then he has 149 tarts left (173 - 86 = 149).
Response:  The baker has made 99 tarts and bought 167 new ones. If he sold 89, then he must have had some left over to sell. So, the number of tarts that Baker bought is equal to the number of tarts he sold minus the number of tarts he already had (which is 0 since he didn't use any). Therefore, the number of tarts that Baker bought is 167 - 89 = 78 more than the number of tarts he sold. In other words, Baker bought 78 additional tarts beyond what he sold.
Response:  The baker made 8 tarts and bought 139 new ones. He sold 145 tarts in total. So, he sold more tarts than he bought. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of tarts he bought from the number of tarts he sold:  Number of tarts sold - Number of tarts bought = 145 - 139 = 6 Therefore, Baker sold 6 more tarts than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 62 tarts initially and then made another 149 tarts. He sold 144 of them. So, there are still 7 tarts left with him (62 - 144 = 7).
"Response: 
We know that Baker made 81 tarts initially and then added another 92 tarts to make in total 173 tarts (81 + 92 = 173). 
From this information, we can calculate how many more tarts Baker made than he sold as follows:
Total number of tarts made by Baker = 173
Number of tarts sold by Baker = 46
Difference between total number of tarts made and number of tarts sold = Total number of tarts made - Number of tarts sold = 173 - 46 = 127
Therefore, Baker made 127 more tarts than he sold."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker has made 61 cakes and 167 tarts. If he sells 108 tarts and 44 sweet pastries, then the number of tarts left with the baker is: Number of tarts sold = 108 Number of tarts remaining = Total number of tarts - Sold tarts = 167 - 108 = 59 So, there are 59 tarts left with the baker.
Response:  The baker has made 56 sweet pastries and 124 tarts. If he sells 104 tarts and 29 sweet pastries, then he will have 37 sweet pastries left (56 - 29 = 37).
"Response:  According to the question, Bakeer has sold 102 torte and 94 scones. If he made 52 sweeties and 84 tarts, then he must have sold some of them as well. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Sweeties + Tarts = Sold (torte + scones)

Now, let's solve for the number of tarts that Baker has sold:

Tarts = Sold - Sweeties

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Tarts = 102 - 52
= 50

Therefore, Bakeer has sold 50 tarts more than he has made."
Response:  We know that the baker made 134 sweet pastries and 11 tarts. If he sold 140 tarts and 92 sweet pastries, then we can calculate how many more sweet pastries the baker made as follows: Number of sweet pastries made by the baker = 134 + (Number of tarts sold - Number of tarts made) = 134 + (-11) = 145 Therefore, the baker made 145 additional sweet pastries beyond what he sold.
Response:  According to the problem, the baker made 14 tarts and 153 sweets. If he sold 8 sweets and 97 tarts, then the number of sweets he sold is equal to 153 - 8 = 145 sweets. Therefore, Bake...
Response:  According to the problem, the baker made 43 tarts and 114 sweets in total. If they sold 154 sweets and 78 tarts, then the number of sweets that Baker Becker sold is equal to the difference between the total number of sweets made and the number of sweets sold by the baker. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of sweets = 43 + 114 = 157 Number of sweets sold by the baker = 154 - 43 = 111 So, Baker Becker sold 111 more sweets than the original baker.
Response:  Kelly has 22 games for Nintendo. To have 140 games, we need to multiply 22 by 6 (since there are 6 games in each pack). So, Kelly needs to buy 132 packs of games ($132 \* 6 = $792).
"Response:  Kelly has 106 games on Nintendo. If she gives 64 matches, then the number of remaining games will be:

Remaining games = Total number of games - Number of given matches
= 106 - 64
= 42
Therefore, there will be 42 games left for Kelly to play after giving away 64 matches."
Response:  Kelie initially had 91 games for Nintendo. If she has remaining 92 matches, that means she has played one game and now has 90 left to play. So, initially, Kelie had 91 games = 90 games left to play.
Response:  Kelly has 20 games for Nintendo and 70 games for Sony. To have 12 games left after giving some away to Nintendo, we need to subtract the number of games he already has for Nintendo (20) from his total number of games (90). So, Kelly needs to give away 78 games (90 - 20 = 78) to Nintendo in order to have 12 games left.
"Response:  Kelly has 46 games for Nintendo and wants to have 31 games for Sony. So, we need to find out how many games he needs to give away from his collection of Nintendo games to get 31 games for Sony. We can do this by subtracting the number of games he already has (46) from the total number of games he wants (31):

Number of games needed = Total number of games wanted - Number of games already owned
= 31 - 46
= -15
So, Kelly needs to give away 15 games from his Nintendo collection to get 31 games for Sony."
Response:  Kelly has 80 games for Nintendo. To find out how many more she needs to have 6 more matches, we can divide 6 by the number of games she already has: 6 / 80 = x. So, Kelly needs to have at least 4 additional games (x) for Nintendo. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Randi had 7 blocks initially. He used 52 of them to build the tower and has 38 left. So, he started with 7 + 52 = 69 blocks in total.
Response:  Randi has 97 blocks and he uses several blocks to build a tower. If there are remaining 72 blocks, then Randi used x blocks to build the tower. We can write an equation:  Number of blocks used = Total number of blocks - Remaining number of blocks  In this case, we have:  Number of blocks used = 97 - 72 = 25 blocks  Therefore, Randi used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  Randi has 79 blocks and he uses 14 of them to build a tower. So, he has 65 remaining blocks (79 - 14 = 65). Then, he uses 11 of those remaining blocks to build a house. Therefore, there are 54 remaining blocks (65 - 11 = 54) that Randi did not use for either the tower or the house.
Response:  Randi has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower (or a cupola). So, he has left with 31 blocks. Now, he builds a house using 53 blocks. Since he doesn't have enough blocks to build both structures simultaneously, he must use some of the remaining blocks for the house as well. Therefore, Randi used 31 + 53 = 84 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randi has 37 blocks and he uses them to build a tower (кула) and a house (къща). We know that he used 33 blocks for the tower and 13 blocks for the house. So, we can write an equation: Number of blocks used for the tower = 33 Number of blocks used for the house = 13 Now, let's solve for the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house: Difference = Number of blocks used for the tower - Number of blocks used for the house = 33 - 13 = 20 Therefore, Randi used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  Randi has 86 blocks in total. He used 79 blocks to build the tower and 82 blocks to build the house. So, he used more blocks for building the house than for building the tower. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and the number of blocks used for building the tower is: 82 - 79 = 3 blocks.  Hence, Randi used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  Randi has already used 36 blocks to build his tower. If he had 59 blocks in total, then he must have 23 blocks left over (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  Randi has 95 blocks in total to build his house and tower. He uses 20 blocks to build the house, so he has 75 blocks left (95 - 20 = 75). To build the tower, he uses 50 blocks, which means he has 25 blocks left (75 - 50 = 25). So, Randi used more blocks to build the tower than he did for the house. The difference is 50 - 20 = 30 blocks. Therefore, Randi built the tower with 30 more blocks than he did for the house.
Response:  Randi has 90 blocks in total and he uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower (or cupola). So, if we subtract the number of blocks used for building the tower from the total number of blocks, we get: Number of blocks used for building the house = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for building the tower = 90 - 63 = 27 blocks Therefore, Randi builds the house using 27 more blocks than he uses for building the tower.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series ""Stupidly Funny School"". If we have not read five of them yet, then we have already read 15 books. Therefore, the answer is 15."
Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and there are still 8 more to be read, that means there are a total of 21 books in the series.
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in the series and you have already read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series: 22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, you still need to read 10 more books from the series. Similarly, for the movies, you have watched 56 out of 100 movies, so you still need to watch 44 more movies.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series ""Stupid School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still need to watch 10 more movies. Therefore, the answer is 10."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""Stupid School"". If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then we can calculate how many more books there are in the series as follows: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books read = 16 - 19 = -3 Books So, there are 3 fewer books in the series than when you started reading them."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series and we have read 19 of them. Therefore, the number of unread books is: 8 - 19 = 11.  Now, let's find out how many movies there are based on the information given in the question: There are 10 movies in total, and we have watched 61 of them. So, the number of unwatched movies is: 10 - 61 = 51.  Therefore, there are 51 more movies than books left to read in the series ""Ludwig's Stupid School""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books in the series and we have read 13 of them. Therefore, we have read an additional 3 books.  Similarly, we know that there are 11 films in the series and we have watched 12 of them. Therefore, we have watched an additional 1 film. So, the difference between the number of books read and the number of films watched is 3 - 1 = 2. Hence, we have read 2 more books than films.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books in the series and you have read 7 of them. Therefore, the number of unread books is 11 - 7 = 4.  Now, we also know that there are 17 movies in the series and you have watched 21 of them. So, the number of movies you haven't seen yet is 17 - 21 = -6. In other words, you have watched more movies than you have read books.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series ""Ludovico Silly School"" that we have already read. So, to find out how many more books there are in the series, we need to subtract the number of books we have read from the total number of books in the series.  Total number of books in the series = 14 books - 8 books = 6 books left to read. Therefore, you still need to read 6 more books from the series ""Ludovico Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books in the series ""Stupid School"". If you have read 4 books, then you still need to read 58 more books (62 - 4 = 58). Similarly, if you have watched 34 films, then you still need to watch 28 more films (62 - 34 = 28). Therefore, you need to read 58 more books and watch 28 more films."
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies in the series and you have already watched 7 of them. So, to find out how many more movies you need to watch, we can subtract the number of movies you have already watched from the total number of movies. Therefore, the answer is:  You still need to watch 1 movie (8 - 7 = 1).
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books read and 40 movies watched. To find out how many more books are in the series, we need to subtract the number of books read from the total number of books in the series. So, if there are 14 books in the series (as stated in the question), then the difference between the number of books read (11) and the total number of books (14) is equal to 3. Therefore, there are 3 more books in the series ""Ludwig's Stupid School"" that have not been read or watched yet."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""Stupid School"". If you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies there are than books as follows: Number of movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies you have watched = 17 - 63 = -46 movies Number of books = Total number of books - Number of books you have read = 11 - 13 = -2 books So, there are 46 more movies than books in the ""Stupid School"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books in the series and we have watched 14 movies. Therefore, the number of books we have not seen is:  Books not seen = Number of books - Number of movies watched = 10 - 14 = 4 books. So, we have read 4 more books than the number of movies we have watched.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series and we have read 19 films from them. Therefore, we can deduce that we have not read any of the remaining 7 books.  Now, let's consider the number of films we have watched compared to the number of books. Since we have watched 16 films out of 8 books (i.e., 200%), it means that for every book we have watched 2 films on average. So, if we have read 19 films, then we have also seen 19 x 2 = 38 books.  Hence, we have seen more films than books in the series.
Response:  Dave has already used 7 tickets to buy toys. So he has remaining 2 tickets. To find out how many tickets he used for buying toys, we can divide the number of tickets he has left (2) by the number of tickets he has already used (7): Number of tickets used = Remaining tickets / Used tickets = 2 / 7 = 0.28 or 28%. Therefore, Dave used 28% of his total tickets (7) to buy toys.
Response:  Dave has already used 12 tickets to buy toys. So he has 14 - 12 = 2 remaining tickets. Therefore, Dave won 2 tickets in the hall.
Response:  Dave has won 18 tickets in total. He used 5 of them to buy toys and 11 more for clothes. So, how many tickets does Dave have left? We can calculate this as follows: Number of tickets Dave has left = Total number of tickets - Number of tickets used for toys - Number of tickets used for clothes Total number of tickets = 18 Number of tickets used for toys = 5 Number of tickets used for clothes = 11 Now we can find out how many tickets Dave has left: Number of tickets Dave has left = Total number of tickets - Number of tickets used for toys - Number of tickets used for clothes = 18 - 5 - 11 = 2 So, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  Dave has won 19 tickets in total. He used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 tickets to buy clothes. So, he used 12 + 7 = 19 tickets for buying clothes. Therefore, Dave used 19 - 12 = 7 tickets for buying clothes.
Response:  Dave has won 13 tickets in total. He used 8 tickets to buy toys and remaining 5 tickets to buy clothes. So, he used 8/13 = 0.6154 (approximately) tickets for buying clothes than for buying toys.
Response:  Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets. So he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he used 10 of those tickets to buy game pieces, then he would have 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  According to the question, Hayley had grown 14 trees in her backyard before Typhoon 9 hit. We are not told how many of those trees survived or died as a result of the typhoon. So, we need to assume that all 14 trees were affected equally by the typhoon.  If half of the trees died (7 trees) and half survived (7 trees), then the difference between the number of dead and alive trees is 7 - 7 = 0.  Therefore, none of the trees died after Typhoon 9.
Response:  According to the question, Hayley had planted 13 trees in her backyard before Typhoon 6 hit. We are not told how many of those trees survived or died as a result of the typhoon. So, we need to use our reasoning skills to find out the number of trees that survived and the number that died. Here is what we know:  Survived trees:  Since Hayley had planted 13 trees, and she did not mention anything about any of them dying, we can assume that all 13 trees survived the typhoon. Therefore, the number of surviving trees is 13. Died trees:  Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to determine how many trees died as a result of the typhoon. Without this information, we cannot calculate the total number of trees that were affected by the typhoon. Conclusion:  Based on the available information, there are 13 surviving trees in Hayley's backyard after Typhoon 6 passed through.
Response:  We know that Hayley had planted 20 trees in her backyard before the typhoon hit. After the typhoon, only 4 trees remained standing. So, we can conclude that 16 trees (i.e., 20 - 4) died during the typhoon. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  According to the question, Hayley had planted 12 trees in her backyard before she died. If there were originally 12 trees and now only 5 are left after Typhoon 5 hit, that means 7 trees have fallen or been destroyed (5 - 12 = 7). So, Hayley had actually planted 7 trees in her backyard.
Response:  Initially, Hayley had 9 trees in her backyard. After Typhoon 4 died, she planted 5 more trees. So, initially, Hayley had 9 + 5 = 14 trees in her backyard. Therefore, the number of trees remaining with Hayley after the typhoon is 14 - 9 = 5 trees.
Response:  We know that two trees in Haley's backyard died after the typhoon. Initially, she had 12 trees. So, if 2 of them died, then the number of remaining trees is: $ 12 - 2 = 10$ Therefore, 10 trees are left behind.
Response:  We know that initially Haley had 3 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, 13 trees died. So, the total number of trees Haley had before the typhoon was 3 + 13 = 16. Therefore, out of the remaining 3 trees, 13 - 3 = 10 more trees died in the typhoon than survived.
Response:  We know that two trees in Haley's backyard died after the typhoon. If she had initially planted 11 trees, then we can conclude that 9 trees survived the typhoon (since 2 died). Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  If they collect 66 baskets per day and there are 28 portokali in one basket, then...

Answer: They collect $\boxed{28 \times 66 = 1744}$ portokali per day."
"Response:  If they collect 8 baskets per day, it means that in one week (7 days) they will collect:

8 x 7 = 56 baskets

So, to collect 24 baskets of potatoes, it will take them:

56 / 24 = 2.33 weeks

Therefore, it will take them approximately 2.33 weeks to collect 24 baskets of potatoes."
"Response:  If they will continue to gather portocali for another 4 days and each day they collect an average of 30 baskets (as mentioned in the question), then we can calculate how many baskets they will collect in total. So, if it takes 4 days to collect 30 baskets per day, then in total they will collect:

$$ Total = \text {Number of days} \times \text{Average number of baskets per day} $$

Total = 4 days x 30 baskets/day = 120 baskets

So, after 4 days, they will have collected 120 baskets of portocali."
Response:  After 49 days, they will have collected 38 x 49 = 1762 portakales.
Response:  After 87 days, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 portocales.
"Response:  If they collect 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 portocales, then we can calculate how many portocales are collected in a day as follows:

Portocales/day = Portocales/basket x Baskets/day
= 35 x 8
= 280

So, they collect 280 portocales per day."
Response:  We know that they collect 16 baskets per day and each basket contains 57 portocales. To calculate how many days it will take to gather 80 baskets of portocales, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total amount / Amount collected per day = 80 / 16 = 5 days. Therefore, it will take 5 days to gather 80 baskets of portocales.
"Response:  If they collect 67 baskets per day and each basket contains 12 portakales, then in one day they collect:

67 x 12 = 804 portakales per day

Now, if they collect 35 baskets of portakales in total, we can calculate how many days it will take them to collect that amount:

Number of days = Total number of portakales / Number of portakales collected per day
= 804 / 67
= 12 days

Therefore, it will take them 12 days to collect 35 baskets of portakales."
Response:  After 51 days, they will have collected 51 x 74 = 3690 portions of potatoes. Since they throw away 71 portions each day, after 51 days there will be 3690 - 71 = 3619 portions of potatoes left.
Response:  If they collect 76 baskets per day and throw away 64 of them, that means they have collected 12 baskets more than thrown away (76 - 64 = 12). So, if there are 50 portokali in one basket, then they collect 50 x 12 = 600 portokali per day.
Response:  After 26 days, the number of mature and immature portokali will be:  Mature portokali = 28 x 26 = 704 Immature portokali = 52 x 26 = 1328 Total portokali after 26 days = 704 + 1328 = 2032 So, there will be 2032 portokali after 26 days.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, there will be 82 x 25 = 2050 zreli portokali collected.
Response:  After 45 days, there will be 45 x 24 = 1080 portions of unripe potatoes collected. Since each portion contains 31 mature potatoes, we have 1080 x 31 = 33,600 mature potatoes after 45 days.
Response:  We know that after Ovidio leaves, 44 baskets of mature portulacas and 25 baskets of immature portulacas are collected per day. To find out how many more baskets of mature portulacas are collected than immature portulacas, we need to subtract the number of baskets of immature portulacas from the total number of baskets collected. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  44 - 25 = 19 baskets. Therefore, 19 more baskets of mature portulacas are collected than immature portulacas per day.
Response:  We know that after Ivan left, they started collecting portobellos and found out that they collected 5 baskets of mature portobello mushrooms and 74 baskets of immature ones per day. To find out how many more baskets of immature portobello mushrooms are collected from mature ones per day, we can use the following formula: (Number of immature portobello mushrooms collected per day) - (Number of mature portobello mushrooms collected per day) = (Number of immature portobello mushrooms collected from mature ones per day). Substituting the values given in the question into this formula, we get: (74 baskets) - (5 baskets) = 69 baskets. Therefore, 69 more baskets of immature portobello mushrooms are collected from the mature ones per day.
"Response:  If they collected 54 portions of potatoes in total, and they were collecting 18 portions per day, then we can calculate how many days it took them to collect all those portions as follows:

Total number of portions = Number of portions collected / Number of portions collected per day x Total number of days
= 54 / 18 x Total number of days

So, if they collected 54 portions of potatoes in total, and they were collecting 18 portions per day, then it took them approximately 3 days to collect all those portions (54 / 18 = 3)."
"Response:  If they collected 56 baskets of potatoes in one day, and they worked for 14 days in total, then we can calculate how many baskets they collected per day as follows:

Total number of baskets = Number of working days x Number of baskets per day
= 14 x?

So, if they collected 56 baskets per day, the answer is 56."
Response:  After 73 days, if they collect 25 chopped immature portulacca and 5 mature portulacca per day, then the total number of chopped mature portulacca collected will be: Total number of chopped mature portulacca = Number of days x Number of chopped mature portulacca per day Total number of chopped mature portulacca = 73 x 5 = 365 chopped mature portulacca So, after 73 days, there will be 365 chopped mature portulacca.
"Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, the number of immature portulacae will decrease by half each day according to the given information. So after 6 days, there will be:

Day 1: 65 x 0.5 = 32.5 immature portulacae
Day 2: 32.5 x 0.5 = 16.25 immature portulacae
Day 3: 16.25 x 0.5 = 8.125 immature portulacae
Day 4: 8.125 x 0.5 = 4.0625 immature portulacae
Day 5: 4.0625 x 0.5 = 2.0312 immature portulacae
Day 6: 2.0312 x 0.5 = 1 immature portulaca

So, after 6 days, there will be 1 immature portulaca left."
Response:  We know that there are 41 chests of unripe portulacas and 86 chests of ripe portulacas per day. To find out how many more chests of ripe portulacas are collected than unripe portulacas, we need to subtract the number of chests of unripe portulacas from the total number of chests collected per day. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  Number of chests of ripe portulacas collected per day - Number of chests of unripe portulacas collected per day = 86 - 41 = 45 chests per day. Therefore, 45 more chests of ripe portulacas are collected than unripe portulacas per day.
Response:  We know that the total number of portocali collected is 71 + 60 = 131. Now we need to find out how many more zreli portocali are collected than non-zreli ones per day. So, let's divide the number of zreli portocali (60) by the total number of portocali collected (131): $ \frac{60}{131} = 0.46$ Therefore, there are 46% more zreli portocali collected than non-zreli ones per day.
Response:  We know that the length of Jessie's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how long the room is compared to its width, we can use the following formula: Length = Width x Height. Since we are given that the height of the room is equal to its width (i.e., 11 feet), we can plug in these values into the formula to get: Length = 11 x 11 = 121 feet. Therefore, Jessie's room is 121 feet long compared to its width of 11 feet.
"Response:  We know that the length of Jessie's room is 2 meters (or 6 feet). If we divide this value by 0.3048 (the conversion factor between meters and feet), we get:

Length of room in feet = 2 meters x 0.3048 = 6.096 feet
Now, we are told that the area of the carpet needed for the room is 14 square feet. So, if we divide the area of the carpet by the length of the room, we can find out how wide the room is:

Width of room in feet = Area of carpet / Length of room = 14 square feet / 6.096 feet = 2.307 feet
Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is approximately 2.307 feet or 0.705 meters."
Response:  We know that the width of the room is 2 meters = 6 feet (since 1 meter = 3.2808 feet). So, if we want to find out how long the room is, we need to divide its width by the length of one foot. Therefore, the length of the room is: $ \frac{2}{3.2808} = 0.6579$ meters or $0.6579\text{ feet}$. Since there are 14 square feet in a square meter, we can convert the length of the room from feet to square meters as follows: $\boxed{\text{Length of room} = 0.6579\text{ feet} \times 14\text{ square feet/foot} = 0.9313\text{ meters}}.$
Response:  The area of the room is given as $A = 4 \text{ meters} \times 4 \text{ meters} = 16 \text{ square meters}$.  To find out how many square feet the room has, we need to convert the area from square meters to square feet. There are $\frac {1}{0.0929}$ square feet in one square meter, so: $$ A = 16 \text{ square meters} \times \frac {1}{0.0929} = 176.37 \text{ square feet}$$ Therefore, Jessie needs $176.37$ square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The stall is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, so its area is: Area = length x width = 2 ft x 12 ft = 24 square feet Now we need to find out how many square feet of flooring are needed to cover the entire floor. To do this, we divide the total area of the stall by the size of each flooring piece: Number of pieces = total area / size of each piece = 24 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 6 pieces So, we need 6 pieces of flooring to cover the entire floor of the stall.
Response:  We know that each stall is 6 meters long and 6 meters wide, so one stall needs 6 x 6 = 36 square meters of space. Since there are 20 stalls in total, we need 36 x 20 = 720 square meters of space for all the stalls. Therefore, 720 kilograms (or 1584 pounds) of hay are needed for all the stalls.
Response:  The width of the room is given as $6$ meters and its length is also given as $6$ meters. Therefore, we can say that the area of the room is equal to the product of its width and length, which is: $$Area = Width \times Length = 6 \times 6 = 36$$ meters squared. Now, we are asked how much longer the room is than it is wide. To find this, we need to divide the length of the room by its width: $$Length / Width = 36 / 6 = 6$$ meters. So, the room is $6$ meters longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since we are given that the room is long (5 feet), we can find its width by dividing the length by 2. So, the width of the room is 5 feet / 2 = 2.5 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 5 feet x 2.5 feet = 12.5 square feet.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since the room is wide by 2 feet, we can say that its length is 2 times the width, or 4 feet. So, the length of the room is 4 feet. Therefore, the length of the rug needed for the room is 10 / 4 = 2.5 feet long.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet Jessi has. Since she has 18 square feet of carpet and each foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate the area as follows: Area = length x width = 18 sq ft x 12 in/ft^2 = 216 sq in Now, we know that the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so we can use these dimensions to find out how much carpet Jessi needs to cover the entire floor: Total area = length x width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 800 sq ft Therefore, Jessi needs 800 / 216 = 3.75 kyliks (or approximately 4 kyliks) of carpet to cover the entire floor.
"Response:  We know that the shop "" Brsnatchet"" made $23 from each sold tennis shoe. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 230 dollars worth of tennis shoes. Therefore, the number of tennis shoes sold is:  Number of tennis shoes = Total amount earned / Amount earned per tennis shoe = 230 / 23 = 9  So, there were 9 tennis shoes sold during the match."
Response:  We know that the total amount of money made from selling 3 t-shirts is $51. So, if we divide this amount by 3, we get the price of each t-shirt: $51 / 3 = $17 per t-shirt. Therefore, each t-shirt costs $17.
"Response:  We know that the shop ""Бръсначът"" sold 95 tee...ns in total during both matches (in Arkansas and Texas). So, if they sold 47 tee...ns during the match in Arkansas, their revenue from selling tee...ns would be: $87 x 47 = $3,999. So, the answer is $3,999."
"Response:  We know that the shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $106 from each sold tennis shoe. Therefore, if they sold 242 tennis shoes during both matches in Arkansas and Texas, their total earnings would be: $106 x 242 = $25,932. Now, we are asked how many tennis shoes were sold during the match in Texas. If the shop sold 115 tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas, then the number of tennis shoes sold during the match in Texas is: $115 - 115 = 0 tennis shoes. So, the answer to the question is 0 tennis shoes."
"Response:  We know that the shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $98 from each sold tennis shoe. During the matches in Arkansas and Texas, they sold a total of 163 tennis shoes. If they sold 89 tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas, how much money did they earn from selling tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas?  To find out, we can multiply the number of tennis shoes sold during the match in Arkansas by the amount earned per tennis shoe: $$ Number of tennis shoes sold in Arkansas = 89 \times $98 = $8,752 $$ So, the shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $8,752 from selling tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas."
"Response:  We know that the shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $78 from each sold tennis shoe. During the match in Arkansas and Texas, they sold a total of 186 tennis shoes. If they sold 172 tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas, how much money did they earn from selling tennis shoes during the match in Texas?  To find out, we can use the following formula: Total amount earned = Number of tennis shoes sold x Price per tennis shoe So, if they sold 172 tennis shoes during the match in Arkansas, the total amount earned from selling tennis shoes during the match in Texas would be: Total amount earned = 172 x $78 = $13040 Therefore, the shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $13040 from selling tennis shoes during the match in Texas."
Response:  The store made $62 from each tennis shoe and $99 from each baseball cap. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 183 tennis shoes and 31 baseball caps. So, their total revenue from selling these items is:  Revenue = Number of tennis shoes x Price per tennis shoe + Number of baseball caps x Price per baseball cap  Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99  Revenue = $11,543 + $2,799  Revenue = $14,342 Therefore, the store earned $14,342 in revenue from selling tennis shoes and baseball caps during the game between Arkansas and Texas.
"Response:  The store ""Бръсначът"" made $67 from each tennis racket and $165 from each tennis ball. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 74 tennis rackets and 156 tennis balls. So, in total, they earned $67 x 74 = $4892 from selling tennis rackets and $165 x 156 = $25,300 from selling tennis balls. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling both tennis rackets and balls is $4892 + $25,300 = $30,192."
Response:  We know that the store made $ 192 from each tennis shoe and $ 34 from each hat. So if they sold 157 tennis shoes and 19 hats during the match between Arkansas and Texas, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total revenue = Number of tennis shoes x Price per tennis shoe + Number of hats x Price per hat In this case, the total revenue would be: Total revenue = 157 x $ 192 + 19 x $ 34 = $ 30,688 + $ 657 = $ 31,345 Therefore, the price of one tennis shoe is $ 192 / 157 = $ 1.23 per shoe, and the price of one hat is $ 34 / 19 = $ 1.74 per hat.
"Response:  The shop ""Бръсначът"" earned $86 from each tennis racket and $232 from each tennis ball. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 254 tennis rackets and 43 masks. So, how much more does a mask cost than a tennis racket? We can find this out by subtracting the price of one tennis racket from the price of one mask: $232 - $86 = $146. Therefore, one mask costs $146 more than one tennis racket."
Response:  The shop sells each tennis shoe for $ 51. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, it offered an discount of $ 8 per pair of shoes and sold 130 pairs. So, if we calculate how much money they made from selling those shoes, we get: Number of pairs of shoes sold = 130 Pairs x Price per pair = $ 51 x 130 = $ 6,430 So, the shop earned $ 6,430 from selling those 130 pairs of shoes.
Response:  The shop sells each tennis shoe for $201 dollars. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they increased the price of each tennis shoe by $217 dollars and sold 14 tennis shoes. So, we need to find out how much money they earned from selling those 14 tennis shoes. We can do this by multiplying the number of tennis shoes sold by the amount they were sold for after the increase: $$ = \text { Number of tennis shoes sold } \times \text{ Price of each tennis shoe after increase} = 14 \times (201 + 217) = 14 \times 318 = 4560$$ Therefore, the shop owners earned $4560 from selling those 14 tennis shoes during the match between Arkansas and Texas.
"Response:  We know that during the match between Arkansas and Texas, the shoe store ""The Brick"" made $60 from selling shoes. If they make $10 profit per sold pair of shoes, then how many pairs of shoes did they sell?  To find out, we can divide the total amount earned ($60) by the profit per sale ($10): $60 / $10 = 6 pairs of shoes. So, The Brick sold 6 pairs of shoes during the match."
Response:  We know that during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech, Raezerbecks shop sold $215 worth of tennis shoes. Since each pair costs $50, we can calculate how many pairs were sold as follows: Number of pairs = Total amount sold / Price per pair = $215 / $50 = 4 pairs Therefore, each pair of tennis shoes cost $50.
Response:  The store earned $5 from each tennis ball and $215 from each basketball game. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 20 tennis balls and 64 masks. So, their total earnings from selling tennis balls are: 20 x $5 = $100. And their total earnings from selling masks are: 64 x $2 = $128. Therefore, the store has earned a total of $100 + $128 = $228 from selling both tennis balls and masks during the match.
Response:  The store made $76 from each tennis shoe and $204 from each pair of shoes. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 158 tennis shoes and 2 pairs of shoes. So, their total revenue from selling tennis shoes was:  $76 x 158 = $11,938 $204 x 2 = $408 Total revenue from selling tennis shoes = $11,938 + $408 = $12,346 Therefore, the store earned $12,346 from selling tennis shoes during that particular match.
Response:  The shop made $210 from each tennis racket and $240 from each tennis ball. During the match between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 177 tennis rackets and 23 masks. So, the total amount of money earned during that match is: $210 x 177 = $38,970 + $240 x 23 = $5,360 = $44,330 Now, let's find out how much more does a tennis racket cost than a tennis ball: $44,330 - ($210 x 177) = $44,330 - $38,970 = $5,360 Therefore, the price difference between a tennis racket and a tennis ball is $5,360.
Response:  We know that the store makes $115 from each tennis shoe and $25 from each mask. So, in total, they make $140 per sale (115 + 25). Now, we need to find out how many sales they made during the match between Arkansas and Texas. According to the question, they sold 113 tennis shoes and 78 masks. Therefore, their total revenue for the match is: Total Revenue = Number of Sales x Price per Sale = 113 x $140 + 78 x $25 = $9,690 + $1,900 = $11,590Now, let's find out how much more does a mask cost than a tennis shoe: Cost difference = Mask price - Tennis shoe price = $25 - $140 = $-115So, the cost difference between a mask and a tennis shoe is $-115.
Response:  We have 5 groups of people (маси) and each group has 10 tables (стола). So, in total we have 5 x 10 = 50 tables.
Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables (маси) and each set has the same number of tables. Therefore, the total number of tables is twice the number of tables in one set. Since we have 12 tables in total, the number of tables in each set must be half of that value, i.e., 6 tables. So, each mass has 6 tables.
Response:  We know that there are several tables in the backyard and each table has three chairs. So, if there are total 9 chairs in the backyard, then there must be at least 3 tables (since each table has 3 chairs). Therefore, there can be at most 3 ma...
Response:  We have 11 guests and each guest will sit at a table. So, we need 11 tables. Since there are 13 chairs in total (including the one for the host), each table has 2 chairs. Therefore, there are 11 x 2 = 22 chairs in the backyard.
Response:  We have 10 tables and each table can seat 6 people, so we have in total 10 x 6 = 60 seats available for guests. If there are 11 people attending the party, then we will need 11 - 60 = -49 seats. Since there are no negative numbers of seats available, it means that all 11 guests will not be able to sit at the party. Therefore, 5 tables will remain free or unoccupied.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table can seat 4 people (since there are 14 chairs at each table). Therefore, the total number of seats for guests is:

12 tables x 4 chairs per table = 48 chairs for guests

So, there are 48 chairs for guests in the backyard party."
Response:  We have 4 massi (tables) and each table can seat 3 people. So, we need to calculate how many tables are needed for 14 guests.  To do this, we divide the number of guests by 3, which gives us 4.67 tables (round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, they will need 5 tables for their party.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 tables for every set of masses and we have 9 sets of masses. So, the total number of tables is:

14 x 9 = 126 tables
Therefore, the number of extra tables beyond the number of masses is:

126 - 9 = 117 tables"
"Response:  If Luiz earned $460 in total for 5 weeks of harvesting crops and he earns $92 per week, then we can calculate his daily income as follows:

$460 / 5 weeks = $92 per week

So, Luiz earns $92 per week."
Response:  We know that Luis earned $1216 during harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, how many weeks did the harvest last? To find this out, we can divide the total amount of money earned ($1216) by the weekly income ($16): $1216 / $16 = 75 weeks So, the harvest lasted for 75 weeks.
"Response:  If Luis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks during the harvest season and has to pay $702 in taxes, then at the end of the harvest season he will have:

$21 x 216 = $4,392 earned during the season
-$702 = $3,690 remaining after paying taxes
Therefore, Luis will have $3,690 at the end of the harvest season."
"Response:  If Luiz earns $1357 every week for 223 weeks during the harvest season, then he has earned:

$$ \text {Total income} = 223 \times 1357 = 304,910 $$
Now, if Luiz works for 73 seasons, his total income will be:

$$ \text{Total income} = 73 \times 304,910 = 22,683,330 $$"
"Response: 
Luis earns $28 per week during harvest season and an additional $939 per week for overtime work outside of harvest season. To find out how much he earns during harvest season, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks in that season:
$28/week x 109 weeks = $2,872
So Luis earns $2,872 during harvest season. Now let's calculate how much he earns from overtime work:
$939/week x (52 weeks - 109 weeks) = $46,660
So Luis earns $46,660 from overtime work outside of harvest season. Therefore, his total annual income is:
$2,872 + $46,660 = $49,532"
"Response:  We know that Luis earned $403 per week for 233 weeks during harvest season. To calculate how much he earned in total, we can multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks he worked:

$403/week x 233 weeks = $87,510

Now, we are asked to find out how much Luis paid in rent each month. The question states that he paid $49 per month. So, let's divide the amount he earned by the rent he paid:

$87,510 / $49/month = 1,763 months

Therefore, Luis earned approximately 1,763 months or 148 years worth of money during the harvest season."
Response:  We know that Luis earned $368 per week for 135 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, he earned a total of $47,240 during the harvest season ($368 x 135 weeks). Now, we are asked how much rent Luis paid throughout the entire harvest season. Since he paid $388 per week, his total rent payment would be: $47,240 / 135 weeks = $348 per week. So, Luis paid $348 per week in rent throughout the entire harvest season.
Response:  Luis earns $491 per week during 118 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income for the season is: $$ Total Income = \text {Number of Weeks} x \text{Weekly Earnings} = 118 \times 491 = 57,088$$ Now, he has to pay $216 per week as rent. So, the amount he will have at the end of the season after paying the rent is: $$ Amount After Rent = Total Income - (Total Income x Rent Per Week) = 57,088 - (57,088 x 216/491) = 33,536$$ Therefore, Luis will have $33,536 at the end of the season after paying the rent.
"Response:  If Luiz earned $133 in total after 19 weeks of harvesting, and he earns $133 every week, then we can calculate his weekly income as follows:

$133 (total amount earned) / 19 (weeks worked) = $7 (weekly income)

Therefore, Luiz earns $7 per week."
Response:  If Luiz earned $2 per week during harvest time, then he earned a total of $2 x 4 = $8 for the entire season (since there are 4 weeks in a season). So, if he earned $8 for the entire season, and the revenue was $178, then the number of weeks in the revenue period is: $$ \frac {178} {8} = 22$$ Therefore, the revenue period lasted for 22 weeks.
Response:  We know that after Dean took a break and decided to dive again, he found himself at a depth of 10 times his height. So if Dean is 5 feet (60 inches) tall, then the depth of the water is 10 x 60 = 600 inches or 50 feet. Therefore, the water is 50 - 9 = 41 feet deeper than Dean's height.
"Response:  We know that after their rest, they decided to dive. The depth of water is twice as great as Dean's height. Dean is two meters shorter than Ron. If Ron is at a depth of four meters, how deep was the water?  Solution:  We can start by using the information given in the problem:

* The depth of water is twice as great as Dean's height (Dean is 2 meters tall)
* Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron (Ron is 4 meters tall)

So, if we let D be Dean's height (in meters), then the depth of water is twice D:

Depth = 2D

We also know that Ron is 4 meters tall, so:

Ron = 4

Now we can substitute these values into the equation for the depth of water:

Depth = 2(D)
= 2(4)
= 8 meters

Therefore, the water was 8 meters deep."
Response:  We know that Ron is 12 feet tall and Deep is 3 meters (or 9 feet) shorter than him, so their height difference is 9 feet. Now we are told that the depth of water is 5 times greater than Ron's height, which means it is 5 x 12 = 60 feet deep. Since Deep is 9 feet shorter than Ron, he would be at a depth of 60 - 9 = 51 feet below the surface.
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 15 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean is 4 feet tall (or 48 inches), then the depth of the water must be 15 x 48 = 720 inches or 60 feet. Since there are 3 feet in a foot, we can convert this to feet as follows: 60 ft / 3 ft/ft = 20 ft. Therefore, the depth of the water was 20 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is 13 feet tall and Dein is 9 feet taller than him, so Dein is 22 feet tall (13 + 9 = 22). Now we need to find out how deep the water was. According to the problem, the depth of the water was 16 times greater than its height. So if the water was 22 feet high, then its depth would be 22 x 16 = 352 feet deep (22 x 16 = 352). Therefore, the water was 352 feet deep.
Response:  We know that the depth of water is 9 times greater than Ron's height. So if Ron is 15 feet tall (4.57 meters), then the depth of the water must be 9 x 15 = 135 feet (40.8 meters) deep.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to distribute them equally among two shelves, he will have 34/2 = 17 books per shelf.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf can hold 2 books, then we need to divide 42 by 2 to find out how many shelves he has:

$$ \frac{42}{2} = 21 $$
So, Brain has 21 shelves."
Response:  Brain has 27 books and 80 magazines in total. If he has them equally distributed among his 23 shelves, then... (1) The number of books per shelf = Total no. of books / No. of shelves = 27/23 = 1. Therefore, Brian has 1 book on each of his 23 shelves.  Now let's consider the magazines. (2) The number of magazines per shelf = Total no. of magazines / No. of shelves = 80/23 = 3.56 (approximately). Since we can't have a fraction of a magazine, Brian must have 4 magazines on each of his 23 shelves. So, the final answer is: Brian has 1 book and 4 magazines on each of his 23 shelves.
"Response:  Brain has 9 books and 46 magazines on each of his 10 shelves. So, in total he has:

$ Number of books = 9 \times 10 = 90 $ books

$ Number of magazines = 46 \times 10 = 460 $ magazines $ $ Therefore, the number of magazines Brain has overall is: 460."
Response:  Brain has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 shelves. So, he has a total number of books = 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines = 61 x 29 = 1799 magazines. Therefore, the total number of books and magazines that Brian has is 647 + 1799 = 2446.
Response:  We know that Brian has 7 shelves with an equal number of books on each shelf. So, if he has 28 books in total, then he must have 4 books on each shelf (28 / 7 = 4).
Response:  Brain has 5 shelves (or rafts). Each shelf contains 2 books. So, total number of books = 5 x 2 = 10 books. Therefore, there are 38 / 10 = 4 rafts.
Response:  Carol wants to invite 10 friends for her birthday party and each friend has bought 2 tickets. Therefore, she needs $ \text {number of cups} = 10 \times 2 = 20 $ cups. Since there are only 10 cups in total, some friends will not be able to attend the party.
Response:  Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her birthday party and bought 3 packages of invitations. Since each package contains an equal number of invitations, we can assume that there are 12 / 3 = 4 invitations in each package. Therefore, there are 4 x 3 = 12 invitations in total.
Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party. Each box of invitations contained 10 invitations and she bought 7 boxes. If she sends invitations only to two friends, how many invitations will remain?  Therefore, there will be 70 invitations remaining (7 boxes x 10 invitations per box).
Response:  Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday party. Each box of invitations had 14 invitations and she bought 6 boxes. After buying more invitations, she has a total of 11 additional invitations. So, in total, Carol can invite 75 friends (14 x 6 = 84 + 11 = 75).
Response:  Carol sends invitations to her friends for her birthday party. Each box of invitations contains 3 invitations, and she buys 2 boxes. To invite 9 friends in total, how many additional invitations will she need to buy?  Therefore, the answer is 2 (additional invitations needed).
Response:  Melisa has scored 12 points in each game. Therefore, she has scored a total of 36 points from playing 3 games. So, she has played 3 games.
Response:  Melisa played 3 matches and scored a total of 81 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each match, we can write an equation based on this information: Points = x (where x is the number of matches). Now, since there are 3 matches, we have: Points = 3x Substituting the value of x from the problem statement, we get: Points = 3(81) = 243 So, Melisa scored 243 points in all three matches combined.
Response:  Melisa has scored 109 points in each match and received 82 bonus points in every game. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can use the formula: Total score = Match score + Bonus score. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 109 x 79 = 8361. So, Melisa scored 8361 points in 79 matches.
Response:  Melisa has scored 21 points in total and she scores 7 points per match. Therefore, we can calculate how many matches she played as follows: Total points = Number of matches x Points per match So, if Melisa scored 21 points in total, then she must have played at least 3 matches (21 / 7 = 3). However, since Melisa said that she scored 7 points in every match, it means that she actually played more than 3 matches. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 matches.
Response:  Melisa has scored 91 points in total across 13 matches, which means she has scored an average of 6.85 points per match (91/13). Now, we need to find out how many points she scored in each match. To do this, we can divide her total score by the number of matches she played: $6.85 \div 13 = 0.52$ points per match. Therefore, Melisa scored $0.52$ points in every match.
Response:  If the Ferris wheel in the Fairy Park has 4 seats and 20 people can be carried at once, then each seat can carry 5 people (20 / 4 = 5).
"Response:  If the Ferris wheel in the Fairy Park has seats and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then we need to find out how many seats are available on the Ferris wheel. Since 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once, we divide 18 by 9 to get the number of seats: 

$ \frac{18}{9} = 2 $

So there are 2 seats available on the Ferris wheel for every 9 people who want to ride it. Therefore, the total number of places on the Ferris wheel is:

$ 2 \times 9 = 18 $

Therefore, there are 18 places on the Ferris wheel in the Fairy Park."
Response:  We know that each wagon in the park has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, we have: Number of wagons = Total number of passengers / Number of passengers per wagon = 20 wagons x 15 people/wagon = 300 people So, 20 wagons can carry 300 people simultaneously.
"Response:  We know that the Ferris wheel in the Ray Park has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then we have to divide the total number of seats available (18) by the number of remaining seats (8). So, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is:

18 / 8 = 2

Therefore, 2 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously if 10 seats are broken."
Response:  We know that the Ferris wheel in the Ray Park has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, we need to find out how many more people can join it. To do this, we divide the total number of people (16) by the capacity of each seat (14): 16 / 14 = 2 Therefore, two more people can join the Ferris wheel.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the Ferris wheel. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so we have:
Small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 people
Now, let's count how many people can fit in each large seat:
Large seats = 23 x 54 = 1208 people
So, the total number of people who can be carried by the Ferris wheel is:
Total capacity = Small seats + Large seats = 28 + 1208 = 1236 people"
"Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the Ferris wheel. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, and each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, we have:

Small seats: 3 x 16 = 48 people
Large seats: 7 x 12 = 84 people
In total, we have: 48 + 84 = 132 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once."
"Response:  If 16 people can fit on the Ferris wheel at once, and each seat has 4 places (as indicated in the question), then we have:

Number of seats = Number of people x Number of places per seat
= 16 x 4
= 64 seats

Therefore, each seat can accommodate 4 people."
"Response:  If four people can ride on the Ferris wheel at once in ""Paradise Park"", then we need to find out how many places there are on the Ferris wheel for four people. Since each place on the Ferris wheel can accommodate two people, if four people ride on it simultaneously, then there will be twice as many places available - 8 places (2 x 4 = 8). Therefore, there are 8 places on the Ferris wheel that can accommodate four people at once."
Response:  We ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices. Therefore, there are 7 x 1 = 7 slices in total. Since there are 14 pieces in total, we can divide them among the 7 pizzas as follows: 7 / 7 = 1 slice per pizza. So, each pizza has 1 slice.
Response:  If each pizza has two slices and we ordered a total of 28 pieces of pizza, then...
Response:  We ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. To find out how many slices we have in total, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza: 17 x 4 = 68 slices. So there are 68 slices of pizza in total.
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90.  If there are two people sharing the pizzas, they will get 90/2 = 45 slices each.
Response:  Page helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 10 seeds in each colorful pot. If there are 45 flowerpots, then the total number of seeds planted is:  Number of seedlings x Number of seeds per pot = 45 flowerpots x 10 seeds/pot = 450 seeds. Therefore, 450 seeds were planted.
Response:  Page helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds. If they equally distributed the same number of seeds into each colorful bed, how many seeds did they plant in each colorful bed?
Response:  We know that Peyge helped her mother plant seeds and together they planted 36 seeds. Since only 12 of them germinated in each color pot, we can say that there are 12/36 = 3/6 = 1/2 as many color pots. Therefore, there are 1/2 \* 36 = 18 color pots. So, there are 18 colorful leaches.
Response:  We know that Page helped her mother plant seeds and together they planted 55 seeds. Since only 15 seeds were placed in each color pot, we can say that 40 seeds did not germinate (55 - 15 = 35). So, out of the total number of seeds planted, 35 grew into flowers (40 / 2 = 20). Therefore, Page and her mother had 20 flowers in total.
Response:  If Page helped her mother plant 10 seeds in each colorful bed and they planted 60 seeds in total, then we can calculate the number of colorful beds as follows: Number of colorful beds = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per bed = 60 / 10 = 6 Colorful beds have been created. Therefore, there are 6 colorful beds.
Response:  Peyge helped her mother plant flowers in 8 flowerbeds. They planted a total of 32 seeds. If they equally divided the seeds among all the flowerbeds, how many seeds did they plant in each flowerbed?
Response:  If Matty had 11 friends and gave each of them 2 biscuits, then he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 biscuits. So, Matty would have had 11 - 22 = -9 biscuits left for himself.
"Response:  If Matty had 8 biscuits to share with his friends and he gave each friend 2 biscuits, then...

1. How many friends does Matty have if he shared 8 biscuits among them?
Answer: 8 / 2 = 4 friends
2. How many biscuits did Matty give away in total?
Answer: 8 - (4 x 2) = 8 - 8 = 0 biscuits left
Therefore, Matty gave biscuits to 4 friends."
Response:  If Matty has 15 biscuits and gives an equal number to each of his 5 friends, then he will have 15 / 5 = 3 biscuits left for himself. Now, if each friend gets an equal number of biscuits as Matty, then each friend will get 3 / 5 = 0.6 biscuits. So, Matty will give 0.6 x 5 = 3 biscuits to his friends. Therefore, Matty will have 3 - 3 = 0 biscuits left after giving them away.
"Response:  If Matty had given an equal number of biscuits to three friends and still has 17 biscuits left, then he must have given each friend x biscuits. Since there are 24 biscuits in total, we can write the equation:

x + 3x + 3x = 24

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 24 - 24

Solving for x:

x = 8

So, Matty gave each friend 8 biscuits."
Response:  If Matty had 22 biscuits and 34 tarts and gave an equal number of each to all his 11 friends, then he would have given 22/11 = 2 biscuits per friend and 34/11 = 3 tarts per friend. So, each friend got 2 biscuits and 3 tarts.
Response:  If Matty had 29 biscuits and 30 tarts, and he gave an equal number of each to his friends, then the number of biscuits given to each friend is also 29. Similarly, the number of tarts given to each friend is also 30. So, if there are x friends in total, then the total number of biscuits consumed by all the friends is 29x, and the total number of tarts consumed is 30x. Therefore, the average number of biscuits consumed per friend is 29/x, and the average number of tarts consumed per friend is 30/x.
"Response:  If Matty had 14 biscuits and 21 tarts, then he gave an equal number of biscuits and tarts to all his 7 friends. So, if X is the number of biscuits given to each friend, we can write the equation:

X + (6X) = 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7X = 98

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

X = 14

Therefore, Matty gave 14 biscuits to each of his 7 friends."
Response:  If Matty has an equal number of biscuits for all his 18 friends, then he will have 18 x 3 = 54 biscuits in total. Since each friend will get an equal share of 54 biscuits, each friend will get 54 / 18 = 3 biscuits. Therefore, each friend will eat 3 biscuits.
Response:  If Matty gave each of his friends 6 biscuits, then he had 6 x 5 = 30 biscuits left after giving them all away. So, if he had initially had 36 biscuits and gave them all away, then he must have started with 36 - 30 = 6 biscuits.
Response:  If Matyu had 23 biscuits and gave equal numbers to his friends, then he gave 23/5 = 4.6 biscuits to each friend (since there are 5 friends). So each friend will eat 4.6 biscuits.
Response:  If Matty had 31 biscuits and gave them to 5 friends, then he would have given away 31 / 5 = 6 biscuits. So, Matty has 31 - 6 = 25 biscuits left.
"Response:  If Matty has given an equal number of biscuits and tarts to all his four friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both biscuits and tarts. So, if he had initially 32 biscuits and 98 tarts, then he must have given each friend:

Number of biscuits = Total number of biscuits / Number of friends
= 32 / 4
= 8 biscuits per friend

Similarly, for tarts:

Number of tarts = Total number of tarts / Number of friends
= 98 / 4
= 24 tarts per friend

Therefore, Matty gave 8 biscuits and 24 tarts to each of his four friends."
"Response:  If Matyu gave an equal number of biscuits and tarts to all his four friends, then he had initially given each friend x biscuits and y tarts, where x + y = 10 (the total number of biscuits) and x + y = 8 (the total number of tarts). Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 5 (since there are 5 friends who received biscuits)
y = 3 (since there are 3 friends who received tarts)
So, Matyu gave 5 biscuits and 3 tarts to each of his 4 friends."
"Response:  If Matyu gave an equal number of biscuits and cakes to 28 friends initially, then he had x biscuits and y cakes initially. Since there are 13 biscuits in total, we can write:
x + y = 28... (1)
Since there are 15 cakes in total, we can write:
x + y = 28... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
x = 7 and y = 16
So Matyu gave 7 biscuits and 16 cakes to each of his 28 friends."
Response:  Debi bought some water bottles during a sale. She drank 109 bottles per day. If the bottles lasted for 74 days, then...
Response:  We know that Debi bought 153 bottles of water during the sale and drank the same number every day. If the bottles lasted for 17 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she drank each day as follows: Number of bottles drunk per day = Total number of bottles / Number of days = 153 / 17 = 9 bottles per day So, Debi drank 9 bottles of water every day for 17 days.
"Response:  Debi bought 264 bottles of water at a discount sale. If she drinks 15 bottles per day for 11 days, how many bottles does she have left?

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles Debi drank during the 11 days.
Total number of bottles = Number of bottles per day x Number of days
= 15 bottles/day x 11 days
= 165 bottles

So far, Debi has drunk 165 bottles of water.

Now let's calculate how many bottles are left after 11 days.
Number of bottles left = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles drunk
= 264 bottles - 165 bottles
= 99 bottles

Therefore, Debi has 99 bottles of water left after drinking 15 bottles per day for 11 days."
"Response:  We know that Debi bought 301 bottles of water at a discount sale. If she drinks 144 bottles per day for several days, then we can calculate how many days she drank water as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles purchased x Number of days drunk
= 301 x (Number of days / 144)

Now, let's find out how many days Debi drank water:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles per day
= 301 / 144
= 2.11 days

Therefore, Debi drank water for approximately 2.11 days."
Response:  We know that Debi bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda at a discount sale. If she drank 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, how many days would it take for her to finish the bottles?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of bottles drunk per day by the total number of bottles available. In this case, if Debi drinks 4 bottles of water per day and 87 bottles of soda per day, then the number of days it will take to finish all the bottles is: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption of bottles Total number of bottles = 88 + 13 = 101 Daily consumption of bottles = 4 (water) + 87 (soda) = 91 Therefore, it will take Debi approximately 101/91 = 1.12 years or 1 year and 6 months to finish all the bottles.
Response:  We know that Debi bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda at a discount sale. If she drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, how many days will it take for her to finish the remaining soda bottles?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of bottles of soda left (256) by the number of bottles drunk per day (4). So, the number of days it will take to finish the remaining soda bottles is: 256 / 4 = 63 days. Therefore, Debi will run out of soda in 63 days if she continues drinking at the same rate.
Response:  Debi drinks 6 bottles of water per day. If she buys 12 bottles of water, it will last her for how many days?  Days = Number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day  Days = 12 / 6  Days = 2  Therefore, the answer is 2 days.
Response:  We know that Debi bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water at a discount sale. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, how many days will the bottles last her?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day: Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day So, in this case, the number of bottles is: Number of bottles = 95 + 180 = 275 Divide by the number of bottles drunk per day: Number of days = 275 / 63 (since Debi drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day) = 4.25 days Therefore, based on the information provided, Debi will be able to sustain the bottles for approximately 4.25 days with her current consumption rate.
Response:  We know that Debi bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water at a discount sale. If she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, how many days would it take for her to finish the remaining bottles of soda?  To solve this problem, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  In this case, the total number of bottles is 360 + 162 = 522 bottles. The daily consumption is 122 bottles of water plus 9 bottles of soda = 131 bottles per day. Therefore, the number of days it would take to finish the remaining bottles of soda is: Number of days = 522 / 131 = 40 days So, Debi would run out of soda in 40 days if she continues drinking at the same rate.
Response:  If Fey has laid out her beads in 14 rows with 11 beads on each row, then...
Response:  If Fey has laid out 12 molives in 3 rows, then she must have placed 4 molives in each row. Therefore, Fey has laid out 4 x 4 = 16 molives in total.
"Response:  We have 28 ointment boxes with 24 moisturizing creams in each box. Therefore, we can calculate how many rows we need as follows:

Number of rows = Total number of moisturizing creams / Number of creams per row
= 28 x 24
= 672

So, there are 672 rows needed to place all the moisturizing creams in rectangular arrays with 16 creams per row."
"Response:  We have:

* 6 oak boxes with 14 molinets each (total of 84 molinets)
* Fey sets up the millstones in rows with 22 millstones per row (total of 440 millstones)

So, the total number of millstones is: 440."
Response:  We have 35 mo...
Response:  We know that Fey has placed her fears and worries in 19 rows with 4 fears and 27 worries in each row. So, we need to calculate how many fears and worries Fey has in total. To do this, we can use multiplication. In each row, there are 4 fears multiplied by 27 worries, giving us a total of 108 fears and worries in each row. Since there are 19 rows, the total number of fears and worries that Fey has is 108 x 19 = 2072. Therefore, Fey has 2072 fears and worries in total.
Response:  If Fey has placed her molvi and boya in 7 rows with 36 molvi and 30 boya in each row, then...
Response:  Since Fey has laid out her cards in 11 rows with 31 cards and 27 boards in each row, we can calculate how many cards and boards she has as follows:  Number of cards = Total number of cards / Number of rows = 31 x 11 = 341 cards  Number of boards = Total number of boards / Number of rows = 27 x 11 = 297 boards Therefore, Fey has 341 cards and 297 boards in total.
Response:  If Fey has laid out 30 molives in rows with 5 molives per row, then we can calculate the number of rows as follows: Number of rows = Total number of molives / Number of molives per row = 30 / 5 = 6 rows. Therefore, Fey can make 6 rows of 5 molives each.
Response:  If there are 6 moliva in total and we have two rows of 3 moliva each, then...
Response:  If Fey has 35 packages of molives and each package contains 4 molives, then she has in total 35 x 4 = 140 molives.  Since she wants to place them in rows with two molives per row, she can make at most 70 rows (since there are only 140 molives).
Response:  If Fey has 31 packages of molives and each package contains 6 molives, then she has in total 31 x 6 = 186 molives. Since she wants to arrange them in rows with 19 molives per row, she will have 186 / 19 = 9 rows of molives. Therefore, Fey has 9 rows of molives, which means she has 9 x 19 = 171 molives in total.
Response:  We know that Fey has put away her fear and worry in 30 rows with 71 molives and 24 molives in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of molives as follows: Total number of molives = Number of rows x Number of molives per row = 30 x 71 = 2130 molives Therefore, Fey has 2130 molives in total.
Response:  If Fey has laid out her fears and worries in 16 rows with 6 molvias each, then she has a total of 16 x 6 = 96 molvias. And if there are 21 molvias in every row, then the total number of molvias is 96 x 21 = 2048. Therefore, Fey has 2048 molvias.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in the school and 7 buses for excursions. Since each bus can hold a maximum of 30 students (based on the information provided), we have: Number of places in all buses = Total number of students / Maximum capacity per bus = 98 students / 30 students/bus = 3.26 buses. Therefore, there are approximately 3.26 buses available for the excursion.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each bus is full of 118 students. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity of each bus Total number of students = 84 x 118 Total number of students = 9620 students
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students, so the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4282 students. Since there are only 6 places in the bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 6 to find out how many buses are needed: 4282 / 6 = 713 students per bus. Therefore, the school needs 7 buses for the excursion.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each class has an equal number of students (58). So, we can assume that each class will occupy one bus seat. Therefore, we need:

Number of classes = Number of classrooms / Number of students per class = 87 / 58 = 1.53 buses
Since you cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 buses. Therefore, the school needs 2 buses for the excursion."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom can accommodate 84 students (based on the information provided). Therefore, we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 120 students / 84 students/class = 3 classes So, there are three classes in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and each bus can accommodate 8 students. So, we need to divide 102 by 8 to find out how many buses we need:  $102 \div 8 = 13$ buses. Therefore, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, we will need 13 buses to transport them.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students who do not want to go on the field trip. So, the number of students who will go on the field trip is: 102 - 11 = 91 students.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 3 places in the bus. So, we need to divide 72 by 3 to find out how many buses are needed for the trip. Therefore, the answer is 24 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in the school. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 20 students (as mentioned in the problem), we have: Number of buses = 46 Number of students = 92 / 20 = 4.6 Now, since the school plans to take an excursion, let's assume that all 46 buses will be used for the excursion. Therefore, the number of students who will go on the excursion is equal to the total number of buses multiplied by the capacity of each bus: Number of students going on the excursion = 46 x 20 = 920 students So, there are 920 students who will go on the excursion.
Response:  If there are n boys in class and each boy gets 9 marbles, then the total number of marbles given is 9n. So, the answer is 9n.
Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and gives 5 to each of 5 girls, then she gave out 5 x 5 = 25 balls in total. So, there are 10 - 25 = 15 balls left with Haley.
Response:  If Haley has 23 tops and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will have 7 left over after giving some away to the boys. So, the number of tops the boys will get is equal to 23 minus 15, which is 8.
Response:  We know that out of 13 boys who like to play marbles, 50 boys like to play cards. So, if Hayley has 26 marbles, then each boy will get 26/13 = 2 marbles. Therefore, the number of marbles the boys will receive is 2.
Response:  If Hayley has 20 marbles and she wants to share them equally among 2 boys in her class, then each boy will get 10 marbles (20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If Haley has given two tops to each of the girls in her class, then she has given a total of 2 x number of girls = 2 x 10 = 20 tops. So, there are 20 tops in total.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages in total. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading pages. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Franks will need 27 days to finish his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and it takes him 569 days to finish the book. So, if he starts reading the book from page 1, he will reach the end of the book in 569 days. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of pages read per day Total number of days = 569 days Page read per day = 22 pages Now, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book: Total number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages read per day = 569 x 22 = 12388 pages Therefore, there are 12388 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish the book (6 dni). Since there are 24 chapters in the book, he read one chapter per day (on average):  Franky читал 1 chapter/day = 24 chapters / 6 дни = 4 chapters/day So, Frank read 4 chapters per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 5 heads in total, each head must have taken him approximately 44 days (220 / 5 = 44). Now, let's calculate how many pages are in each chapter based on the number of days it took Franck to read them: Chapter 1 - 44 days Chapter 2 - 44 days Chapter 3 - 44 days Chapter 4 - 44 days Chapter 5 - 44 days Therefore, each chapter has approximately 98 pages (44 x 2 = 96 pages per chapter).
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish his book (193 pages / 660 days = approximately 0.28 pages per day). Now, we need to divide this number by the number of chapters in the book to find out how many chapters he read each day. According to the problem, there are 15 chapters in the book. Therefore, Franks reads: 0.28 pages/day x 15 chapters/book = approximately 4 pages per day. So, Franks read 4 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to finish each book (which has 249 pages), then he must have read at most $pages per day$. Since there are $days$ in total, we can write an inequality: $$pages \leq 3$$ Now, let's solve for $pages$. We get: $$pages = 3$$ So, Frank could have read at most 3 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank took 12 days to read each book (with 66 pages), then he reads one book every 12/66 = 0.185 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, Frank can read approximately 365 x 0.185 = 67 books per year. Therefore, if it takes him 492 days to read all the books, he has read a total of 492 / 67 = 7.3 books per day.
Response:  If Frank took 16 days to finish his favorite book (which has 112 pages), then he read an average of pages per day. So, if we divide the number of pages he read by the number of days it took him to finish the book, we get:  pages/days = 112 pages / 16 days = pages/day  Therefore, Frank read approximately pages per day.
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank will need 72 days to finish reading his favorite book if he continues reading at the same pace of 8 pages per day."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter had 450 pages and there were 41 chapters in total, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 41 x 450 + 41 x 450 (since he finished last chapter in one day)
= 18,650 + 18,650
= 37,300 pages
So, Franks read approximately 37,300 pages in 30 days."
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish his favorite book. Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate how many chapters there are in total as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of pages per chapter Chapter length = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Therefore, if we substitute the values given in the problem into these formulas, we get: Number of chapters = 3 x 1582 = 4748 pages Number of chapters = 4748 / 594 = 8 Chapters So, there are 8 chapters in Franks favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish the book Time taken to finish the book = 664 days x 24 hours/day (assuming he reads every day) = 15,976 hours Now, let's divide the total number of chapters by the time taken to finish them: Chapters per day = Total number of chapters / 15,976 hours = 28.3 chapters/day So, Franks read approximately 28 chapters per day.
Response:  We know that there are 6 packages of DVDs and they cost $120 in total. To find out how much each package costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of packages: $120 / 6 = $20 per package. Therefore, each package of DVDs costs $20.
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $81, then 33 packages will cost $81 x 33 = $2697.
"Response:  We know that each DVD box costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 for each package. So, if we want to buy x packages of DVDs with a total cost of $93, we can calculate it as follows:

$/package = $107 - ($106 \* x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = $\frac{93}{106}$

Therefore, you can buy $\boxed{9}$ packages of DVDs with $93$."
Response:  If each box of DVDs costs $76, then you will save $25 for every box you buy. So, if you want to know how much you need to pay for each box, you can simply subtract the discount amount from the original price: $76 - $25 = $51 per box. Therefore, you will have to pay $51 for each box of DVDs.
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each package of DVDs costs $26, then you can buy:

$104 / $26 = 4 packages
Therefore, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs with your $104."
"Response:  If $28 can buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package costs:
$28 / 2 = $14 per package"
Response:  If there are 18 bananas in Philip's collection and they are arranged in groups of size 2, then we need to divide them into groups such that each group contains exactly 2 bananas. Since there are 18 bananas total, we can create 9 different groups (since 18 / 2 = 9). So, there are 9 groups with 2 bananas each.
"Response:  If there are several bananas in Philip's collection and they are arranged in 140 groups of size 187, then we can calculate the total number of bananas as follows:

Total number of groups = Number of bananas / Size of each group = 140
Number of bananas per group = Total number of groups x Number of bananas in each group = 187
Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is:
Total number of bananas = Number of bananas per group x Total number of groups = 187 x 140 = 26,990
So, there are approximately 26,990 bananas in Philip's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 portocallos in Philip's collection. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 7, then each group will have 29 bananas (203 / 7 = 29). Similarly, if we divide the number of portocallos into groups of 95, then each group will have 6 portocallos (63 / 95 = 6). Therefore, the size of each group is: Bananas - 29; Portocallos - 6."
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 portocallos in Philip's collection. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 47, then each group will have 142/47 = 29 bananas. Similarly, if we divide the number of portocallos into groups of 178, then each group will have 356/178 = 20 portocallos. Therefore, each group has 29 bananas and 20 portocallos.
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in total and each group contains an equal number of bananas (i.e., 392 / 196 = x). Therefore, we can write the equation:
x = 392/196 = 2
So, each group contains 2 bananas."
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group of Philp's collection. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group. In this case, the total number of bananas is 180, and the number of bananas per group is 18. So, we can solve for the number of groups as follows: Number of groups = 180 / 18 = 10 groups. Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philp's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. So, the number of bananas in each group is:

Group 1: Number of bananas = Total number of bananas - Number of bananas in Group 2
= 290 - (Number of bananas in Group 2 / 2)
= 290 - (145/2)
= 290 - 72.5
= 217.5

So, there are 217.5 bananas in each group."
Response:  We know that there are 384 portocals and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the number of bananas into groups of 345, then each group will have 345/345 = 1 banana. Similarly, if we divide the number of portocals into groups of 16, then each group will have 384/16 = 24 portocals. Therefore, there are 24 portocals in each group.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 38 biscuits and each of them had 19 biscuits inside, then...

1. The total number of biscuits is 38 x 19 = 702.

So, Brenda's mother has prepared 702 biscuits for the guests."
Response:  If Mayta made biscuits for 14 people and each person had 30 biscuits, then we can calculate how many biscuits Mayta made in total as follows: Number of biscuits = Total number of people x Number of biscuits per person = 14 x 30 = 420 biscuits So, according to the question, Mayta made 420 biscuits.
Response:  If Майката на Бренда has made biscuits for 5 people and she has prepared 22 biscuits in total but had to throw away 17 of them, then we can calculate how many biscuits each person got as follows: Number of biscuits per person = Total number of biscuits / Number of people  In this case, the total number of biscuits is 22, and the number of people is 5. So, we can calculate the number of biscuits per person as follows: Number of biscuits per person = 22 / 5 = 4.4 biscuits per person Since there are not whole numbers of biscuits (e.g., 4.4), we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each person gets 4 biscuits.
Response:  If Mayta had prepared 18 biscuits and 9 guests did not come, then each guest would have received 2 biscuits (18 / 9 = 2). So, if Brenda had given each of her 10 guests an equal number of biscuits, then she gave them 20 biscuits in total (10 x 2 = 20).
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 biscuits for two guests, then each guest will have half of those biscuits, which is 7 biscuits each. So, there are 7 biscuits per guest.
Response:  If Mayta made biscuits for 10 guests and each guest had two biscuits, then Mayta made a total of 20 biscuits (10 x 2 = 20).
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of bonnibi and he wants to put them equally in two boxes, then each box will have 42/2 = 21 pieces of bonbons.
Response:  We know that Frank had some bonbons and he put them in 26 boxes with 33 pieces of each box. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Bonbons = Total number of pieces / Number of boxes. In this case, the total number of pieces is 26 x 33 = 840. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are in one box. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of boxes: Number of Pieces per Box = Total number of pieces / Number of boxes. In this case, the number of pieces per box is 840 / 26 = 33. Therefore, Franks had 33 pieces of bonbons in each of the 26 boxes.
Response:  Franks had 33 bonbons and he lost 24 of them. So, he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining bonbons. To pack these 9 bonbons into bags with 9 pieces in each bag, we will need 9 / 9 = 1 bag. Therefore, there will be 1 bag.
Response:  If Frank has put 11 bonbons in each of 22 bags, then we have: Number of bags = Total number of bonbons / Number of bonbons in each bag = 22 / 11 = 2 torbies So there will be 2 torbie
Response:  Frank has put some pieces of bonbon in two bags. If he has put x pieces of bonbon in one bag, then he must have put (2x) pieces of bonbon in the other bag. Since there are 16 pieces of bonbon in total, we can write the equation: x + (2x) = 16. Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x = 16. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get: x = 5. So, Frank has put 5 pieces of bonbon in each bag.

Response:  Shirley has to deliver 10 boxes with trephines. Each box contains 5 cups of trephines, so...
Response:  We know that there are more than 50 bottles of regular soda in the store (67 - 9 = 58). So, we can say that for every 2 diet sodas, there is 3 regular sodas. Therefore, if there are x regular sodas, then there will be 3x diet sodas. Now, let's substitute this value into the equation: 58 > 3x. Solving for x, we get:  x > 19. So, there are at least 19 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are more than twice as many diet soda bottles as regular soda bottles in the store. So if there were x bottles of regular soda, then there would be 2x bottles of diet soda. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (2x) = 2(22) + 61

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

3x = 85

So there are 3 times as many diet soda bottles as regular soda bottles in the store."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 regular soda bottles and 8 dietetic soda bottles in total. So, we have:

Total number of bottles = Number of regular soda bottles + Number of dietetic soda bottles
= 30 + 8
= 38

Therefore, there were 38 bottles in total."
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda in the store and 53 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation:  Regular soda = 79.  Diet soda = 53. Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda: More regular soda = Total regular soda - Total diet soda.  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: More regular soda = 79 - 53 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda in the store. So, we can write this as an equation:

Diets = 54
Regular = 83 - Diets

Now, we want to find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda. To do this, we subtract the number of diet bottles from the total number of regular bottles:

More Regular = Regular - Diets = 83 - 54 = 29

So, there are 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda in the store."
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles in total and 9 of them are ordinary sparkling drinks. So, the number of diet sodas is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, 8 diet sodas were consumed.
"Response:  We know that there are more than 35 bottles of regular soda in total (19 dietetic + 60 regular). So, we can say that the number of regular soda bottles is greater than 35. Now, let's assume that the number of regular soda bottles is x. Then, we can write an equation based on this assumption:

x > 35...(1)

Now, we know that the number of dietetic soda bottles is 19, so we can write another equation:

x - 19 = 60...(2)

Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many more regular soda bottles there are compared to dietetic ones. To do this, we will add equation (1) and equation (2):

2x = 104...(3)

Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:

x = 52...(4)

So, there are 52 more regular soda bottles than dietetic ones."
Response:  We know that there are 72 bottles of regular sparkling water and 32 bottles of dietary sparkling water in total.  Now let's count how many jars of apples there are: There are 78 jars of apples. So we can calculate the difference between the number of jars of apples and the total number of bottles as follows: Number of jars of apples - Total number of bottles = 78 - (72 + 32) = 78 - 104 = -26 jars. Therefore, there are 26 fewer bottles than jars of apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 jars of apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. So, we have:

Apples = 36
Regular Soda = 80

Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda there are:

Diet Soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of regular soda
= 124 - 80
= 44

So, there are 44 more bottles of diet soda than apples in the store. Therefore, the answer is:

Pовече бутилки от ябѫлка имаха = 44"
Response:  We know that there are 30 total bottles in the store and 28 of them are regular soda. So, we can conclude that the number of diet sodas is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 diet sodas in the store.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 dietary soda bottles in the store and they contain 350 ml each. So, we have:

Number of dietary soda bottles = 4
Capacity of each bottle (in ml) = 350
Total capacity of all bottles = Number of bottles x Capacity of each bottle
= 4 x 350 = 1400 ml
Now, let's find out how many ordinary sodas are needed to make up for the difference between the total capacity of the dietary soda bottles and the number of bottles available:

Ordinary soda bottles = Total capacity of dietary soda bottles - Number of dietary soda bottles
= 1400 - 4
= 1396 ml
So, if there were 79 more ordinary soda bottles than dietary soda bottles, then:

Number of ordinary soda bottles = 1396 / 350
= 4.2
Therefore, there would be approximately 4.2 ordinary soda bottles for every 350 ml of dietary soda."
Response:  We know that there are 57 regular soda bottles and 26 dietetic soda bottles in total. So, we can write this as an equation: 57 + 26 = X, where X is the total number of bottles. Now, we also know that there are 27 lightly sweetened soda bottles. Therefore, we can add it to our equation: 57 + 26 + 27 = X. Simplifying the equation, we get: X = 100. So, there were 100 bottles in total.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda in total.  From this information, we can conclude that the number of bottles of diet soda is less than or equal to 81 - 60 = 21. Therefore, there are more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of regular soda and 40 bottles of diet soda in the store. So, we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 49
Diet soda = 40

Now, let's find out how many bottles of regular soda were consumed. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the total number of bottles of soda available:

Consumed regular soda = Total soda - Regular soda
= 49 + 40
= 89

So, 89 bottles of regular soda were consumed. Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda were consumed. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of soda available:

Consumed diet soda = Total soda - Diet soda
= 49 + 40
= 89

So, 89 bottles of diet soda were also consumed. Therefore, the answer is:

Consumed regular soda = 89
Consumed diet soda = 89"
Response:  We know that there were 295 visitors to the palace yesterday and today there are 317 visitors. So, if we subtract the number of visitors from yesterday (295) from the total number of visitors today (317), we get the difference in visitors between the two days: 317 - 295 = 22. Therefore, there are 22 more visitors at the palace today than there were yesterday.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Blenheim Palace in the previous day and now there are 246 visitors in one day, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Average daily visitors = Total visitors / Number of days  Average daily visitors = 703 / 25 = 28.12 So, approximately 28-29 people visit Blenheim Palace every day.
Response:  We know that there were 100 visitors to the Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 666 visitors. So, we can write an equation: 100 + x = 666 where x is the number of additional visitors today. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 100 from both sides of the equation: x = 666 - 100 = 566 Therefore, there are 566 more visitors today than yesterday.
"Response:  We know that there are 132 visitors to Blenheim Palace today and we want to find out how many visitors came to Blenheim Palace yesterday. To do this, we need to use the information given in the problem statement. The problem states that ""406 people have visited Blenheim Palace over the last 327 days."" So if 406 people visited Blenham Palace over the last 327 days, then the number of visitors who came to Blenham Palace yesterday is equal to 406 / 327 = 1.25 times as many visitors as came to Blenham Palace today. Therefore, the number of visitors who came to Blenham Palace yesterday is 1.25 x 132 = 165 visitors."
Response:  We know that 45 people visited Blenheim Palace the day before and 829 people have visited it in the last 85 days. So, if we want to find out how many visitors came to Blenheim Palace on that particular day, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit x Number of visits per day. Plugging in the numbers, we get: Number of visitors = 829 / (85 - 1) x 8 = 829 x 8 = 6760 visitors. Therefore, 6760 visitors came to Blenheim Palace on that particular day.
"Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings in the palace during Racheal's visit and she saw them all. So, if we assume that each painting is visited by an average of 2 people per day (which may not be accurate but it will give us a rough estimate), then the total number of visitors to the palace over the last 57 days would be:

Total no. of visitors = Total no. of paintings x Average no. of visitors/painting/day
= 71 x 2
= 142

So, according to this calculation, approximately 142 people have visited Blenheim Palace over the last 57 days."
Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings in the Bingham Palace and 661 visitors came to see them today. If we subtract the number of visitors from yesterday (600), we get the difference between the two days: 661 - 600 = 61. So, there are 61 more visitors who came to see the paintings at Bingham Palace today than visited it yesterday.
"Response:  We know that there are 92 visitors to Blenheim Palace today and we want to find out how many visitors came before today.  So let's use the information given in the previous days:  On day 1, 419 visitors came to Blenheim Palace;  On day 2, 103 visitors came to Blenheim Palace.  Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors who came to Blenheim Palace before today:  Total visitors = Day 1 + Day 2 = 419 + 103 = 522 visitors. Therefore, before today, 522 people visited Blenheim Palace."
Response:  We know that there are 512 visitors to Blenheim Palace today and we want to find out how many visitors have come in the last 89 days. To do this, we need to use the information given in the previous questions. If 471 people visited yesterday and 808 people visited two days ago, then the total number of visitors over the past 89 days is:  Total visitors = Yesterday + 2 days ago +... + 89 days ago  Total visitors = 471 + 808 +... + 361 = 2,040 Therefore, there were 2,040 visitors to Blenheim Palace in the last 89 days.
Response:  We know that there are 705 visitors to Blenheim Palace today. In addition, we know that there were 191 visitors yesterday and 457 visitors the day before that, for a total of 848 visitors in the past 3 days. So, if we subtract the number of visitors from the previous 2 days (848 - 191 - 457 = 260), we can see how many more visitors came to Blenheim Palace today compared to the previous 2 days. Therefore, the answer is 260 more visitors today than in the previous 2 days.
Response:  We know that he has already used 100 grams of wax and needs another 159 grams to glue all the feathers together. So, if we add these two amounts, we get: 100 + 159 = 259 grams. Therefore, he currently has 259 grams of wax left.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of paint needed is 49 grams and the total amount of glue needed is 288 grams. So far, we have:

Paint = 49 grams
Glue = 288 grams

Now let's find out how much glue is left after painting:

Glue - Paint = (288 grams - 49 grams) = 239 grams

So there are 239 grams of glue left after painting."
Response:  We know that the artist has already used 57 grams of paint to create his next work and needs another 22 grams of varnish. Therefore, the total amount of paint he has used so far is 57 + 22 = 79 grams. Since each feather requires 353 grams of varnish, we can calculate how much varnish the artist has left by subtracting the amount he has used from the total required for all the feathers: 79 - 353 = -264 grams. So, the artist has -264 grams of varnish left.
Response:  We know that the total weight of glue needed to stick all the feathers is 166 grams. The person has only 20 grams of glue left. So, we need to find out how many times 20 grams can be divided into 166 grams. To do this, we divide 166 grams by 20 grams: 166 / 20 = 8.3. Therefore, the person needs 8 more grams of glue to stick all the feathers.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the feathers is 557 grams and we need to add 17 grams more for the next bird. So, the total weight of the feathers needed for the next bird will be: 557 + 17 = 574 grams.
Response:  We know that he has 11 grams of wax and the feathers require a total of 492 grams of wax. So we need to find out how much more wax is required. To do this, we can divide the total amount of wax needed by the amount of wax he already has: 492 grams / 11 grams = 45 grams. Therefore, he needs an additional 45 grams of wax.
Response:  If 94 collectors can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 6 days, that means they will fill 15 barrels per day (90 / 94 = 15).
Response:  If 266 collectors can fill 90 barrels of grapes in 5 days, then each day they will be able to fill 18 barrels (90/5 = 18).
"Response:  If the collectors are filling 244 bottles of grapes per day and 47 bottles of raisins per day, then they will fill a total of:

Grapes: 244 x 146 = 35,084 bottles of grapes
Raisins: 47 x 146 = 6,692 bottles of raisins
In total, the collectors will fill 41,776 bottles in 146 days."
Response:  If they are filling 221 baskets of grapes per day and there are 77 days left until the last stop, then in total they will fill 16,477 baskets of grapes (221 x 77 = 16,477).
"Response:  If he checks the vineyards after 57 stops and 252 collectors tell him that they fill 108 barrels of grapes per day, then we can calculate how many barrels will be filled in 58 days as follows:

Barrels filled per day = Number of collectors x Amount of grapes collected per day
= 252 collectors x 108 barrels/day
= 26,944 barrels

So, for 58 days, the total number of barrels filled will be:
Total barrels filled = Number of barrels filled per day x Number of days
= 26,944 barrels x 58 days
= 1,533,096 barrels
Therefore, 1,533,096 barrels of grapes will be filled during the 58-day period."
Response:  If 36 collectors are filling 8 bottles of grapes per day, it means they are filling 36 x 8 = 288 bottles per day. To fill 240 bottles, we need to add 240 - 288 = 52 days. Therefore, it will take 52 days to fill 240 bottles of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of saltwater animals. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of saltwater animals in one aquarium = Total number of saltwater animals / Number of aquariums So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of saltwater animals in one aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2 So, there are 2 saltwater animals in each aquarium.
Response:  We know that there were 40 saltwater animals in different aquariums. Since each aquarium had two animals, we can write this as:  Number of aquariums = Total number of animals / Number of animals per aquarium = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, there were 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 for freshwater animals. Since each aquarium has 39 living creatures in it, we can write an equation as follows: Saltwater animals = 56 x 39 = 2174 Freshwater animals = 10 x 39 = 390 Total number of animals = Saltwater animals + Freshwater animals = 2174 + 390 = 2564 Therefore, Taylor has 2564 saltwater and freshwater animals altogether.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 for saltwater animals. Since each aquarium has 46 living creatures inside it, we can calculate the total number of living things in all aquariums as follows: Freshwater animals = 74 x 46 = 3380 Saltwater animals = 22 x 46 = 952 Total living things = 3380 + 952 = 4332 Therefore, Taylor has 4332 saltwater animals in his aquariums.
Response:  For the saltwater aquariums, there are 15 aquariums with an average of 19 fish in each one, so we have: 15 x 19 = 285 fish.  For the freshwater aquariums, there are 62 aquariums with an average of 19 fish in each one, so we have: 62 x 19 = 1138 fish.  Therefore, the total number of fish is: 285 + 1138 = 1423 fish.
Response:  If the white tennis shoes can be bought in packages of 13, and Mom buys 39 pairs, then we need to divide 39 by 13 to find out how many packages Mom will get. So, Mom will have 3 packets.
Response:  If Mama buys 66 white tennis shoes and each pack contains 3 white tennis shoes, then we can divide 66 by 3 to get the number of packets: 66 / 3 = 22 packets. Therefore, there will be 22 packets of white tennis shoes.
"Response:  If Mama buys 28 packs of white tennis shoes and each pack contains 56 white tennis shoes, then...

1. How many packs does Mama buy in total?
Answer: 28 packs
2. How many white tennis shoes are there in total?
Answer: 56 x 28 = 1576 white tennis shoes
Therefore, there are 1576 white tennis shoes in total."
"Response:  If Mama buys 57 packages of white tennis shoes and each package contains 53 pairs of white tennis shoes, then she will have in total:

57 packages x 53 pairs/package = 3092 pairs of white tennis shoes

Now, let's find out how many white tennis shoes there are if Mama buys 34 pants. Since each pair of white tennis shoes comes with one pair of pants, we can subtract the number of pants from the total number of pairs to get the number of white tennis shoes:

3092 pairs - 34 pairs = 3058 pairs of white tennis shoes

Therefore, Mama will have 3058 pairs of white tennis shoes if she buys 57 packages of them and 34 pants."
Response:  If Mama buys 51 white tennis shoes and each pair costs $30, then she has spent $1530 ($51 x $30). So, if she can buy them in packs of three, how many packs will she have? We need to divide the total amount she spent by the cost per pack: $1530 / $90 = 17 packs. Therefore, Mama will have 17 packs of white tennis shoes.
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white tennis shoes in total and she buys them in packages of 14 packages, then we can find out how many white tennis shoes are in each package as follows: Number of white tennis shoes in each package = Total number of white tennis shoes / Number of packages = 70 / 14 = 5 So there are 5 white tennis shoes in each package.
Response:  If you have 4 torches with an equal number of biscuits and a total of 36 biscuits, then each torch must contain 9 biscuits (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  If you have 33 biscuits and each bag contains 11 biscuits, then: Number of bags = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits in each bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags So, you have 3 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If each basket has 41 biscuits and you have 53 baskets of biscuits, then the total number of biscuits is:  Number of biscuits = Total number of baskets x Number of biscuits in each basket  Number of biscuits = 53 x 41  Number of biscuits = 2193 biscuits So, there will be 2193 biscuits in total if you have 53 baskets of biscuits with 41 biscuits in each basket.
Response:  If you have 14 biscuits in total and 7 baskets with an equal number of biscuits, then each basket has 14/7 = 2 biscuits. Therefore, there are 7 x 2 = 14 biscuits in all the baskets combined.
Response:  If each basket has 3 biscuits and you have altogether 21 biscuits, then the number of baskets is: Number of biscuits = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits in each basket = 21 / 3 = 7 baskets. Therefore, you have 7 baskets of biscuits.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 torbici with equal number of biscuits. So, if we divide 26 torbici into two groups of 15 and 52 biscuits respectively, then each group will have 3/4 of total number of biscuits. Therefore, the number of biscuits in each torbica is: Number of biscuits = Total number of biscuits / Number of torbici = 52 / 26 = 2.
Therefore, you have 2 torbici with 2 biscuits each."
Response:  We know that there are 14 baskets of biscuits with an equal number of biscuits in each basket. So, if we have 28 biscuits and 86 bonbons altogether, then we can divide them equally among the 14 baskets to find out how many biscuits and how many bonbons are in each basket. Therefore, the answer is: Number of torbi...
Response:  If the postman gives 5 unwanted letters to each house in a block and there are $X$ houses in a block, then the total number of unwanted letters given by the postman is $\text{5} \times X$.  Therefore, if the postman gave 25 letters to every house in a block, the total number of houses in the block would be $\frac{\text{Total number of unwanted letters}}{\text{Number of letters per house}} = \frac{\text{5} \times X}{\text{25}} = X$.
Response:  We have to deliver 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block. Since there are 20 houses in each block, we need to divide 9 by 20 to find out how many pieces of unwanted mail to give to each block. So, the answer is 45 pieces of unwanted mail per block (9/20).
Response:  There are 6 houses in the building, and each house receives 24 pieces of unwanted mail. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 144 pieces of unwanted mail (24 x 6 = 144).
"Response:  The postman sends 14 unwanted letters to every house in the quarter. Since there are 4 quarters in total (as mentioned in the problem statement), we can assume that each quarter has an equal number of houses. Therefore, the number of houses in one block is also equal for all blocks. So, if the postman needs to give two packages per block, then the number of blocks is:

Number of blocks = Number of houses / 2 packages per block = 14 unwanted letters / 2 packages per block = 7 blocks

Therefore, there are 7 blocks in the quarter."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to deliver 32 pieces of unwanted mail to every house in each block, then he will need to deliver 640 pieces of unwanted mail in total (20 x 32 = 640).
Response:  We know that there are 78 blocks in total and each block has 19 houses. So, we need to divide $30 \times 78 = 2340$ pieces of unwanted mail among these $19 \times 78 = 1452$ houses. Since each house receives $2340 / 1452 = 16$ pieces of unwanted mail on average.
Response:  We know that the postman has to deliver 8 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 55 quarterly sections. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, the total number of unwanted letters he needs to deliver is 8 x 55 = 440. Now, we need to find out how many houses are in each block. If the postman delivers 32 pieces of mail to each house in each block, then the number of blocks is 440 / 32 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 blocks in the area.
Response:  We have to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every one of the 81 blocks. Since there are 12 houses in each building, we need to divide the total number of pieces of unwanted mail by 12 to determine how many pieces to give to each building. Therefore, the answer is: 4 / 12 = 3/4 or 0.75. So, the postman needs to give 3/4 or 0.75 pieces of unwanted mail to each building.
Response:  We have 16 blocks with 17 houses each, so we need to deliver 252 pieces of unwanted mail (4 x 16 x 17 = 252).
Response:  We have 10 eggs and 20 marbles to share equally among groups of 4 people each. To find out how many groups we can make, we need to divide both numbers by 4:  Number of groups = (Number of eggs / 4) + (Number of marbles / 4) = (10 / 4) + (20 / 4) = 2 + 5 = 7 groups So, Rebeka can create 7 groups with an equal number of eggs and marbles in each group.
"Response:  We have 10 topche and 15 eggs. If we divide them equally among groups of 5, then... (use mathematical notation to show your calculation)

Answer: There will be 3 groups."
"Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide her egg collection into groups of 11 eggs each, and each group has 2 eggs, then...

Step 1: Count the total number of eggs in Rebecca's collection.
Total number of eggs = Number of groups x Number of eggs in each group
= 11 x 2
= 22 eggs

So, there are 22 eggs in Rebeka's collection."
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. She wants to divide them into 4 groups. Since there are 8 eggs, each group will have 2 eggs at most (since you can't have more than 2 eggs in one group). Therefore, each group will have at most 2 eggs. Now, let's count how many marbles each group will have: Group 1: 6 marbles - 2 eggs = 4 marbles Group 2: 6 marbles - 2 eggs = 4 marbles Group 3: 6 marbles - 2 eggs = 4 marbles Group 4: 6 marbles - 2 eggs = 4 marbles So, each group will have 4 marbles.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 4 toy cars and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. To do this, we can use division. For example, if we want to divide 15 eggs equally among 3 groups, each group will get 5 eggs. Therefore, there will be 5 eggs in Group 1, 5 eggs in Group 2, and 5 eggs in Group 3.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 6. So, we need to find out how many groups can be formed using all these objects together (eggs, bananas, and topche). To do this, we will use division.  First, let's calculate the total number of objects Rebeka has: 18 eggs + 72 bananas + 66 topche = 156 objects. Now, let's divide the total number of objects by 6 (the number of groups Rebeka wants to create): 156 / 6 = 26 groups. Therefore, Rebeka can create 26 groups with her collection of eggs, bananas, and topche.
Response:  We have 99 bananas and 9 eggs. Each egg can be divided into 3 groups of 3 each (since there are 3 eggs in total). So, we will divide the bananas and eggs equally among these groups. Now, we have 31 groups of 3 bananas and 3 eggs each. Next, we have 27 toy cars, which means we need to divide them equally among the remaining 30 groups (since there are only 30 groups left after dividing the bananas and eggs). Therefore, we will divide each group of 30 among 10 groups of 3 toy cars each ( since there are 10 groups left after dividing the bananas and eggs). So, in total, Rebeka will create 31 x 10 = 310 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 20 eggs and 6 toy cars. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these numbers. To do this, we will use division. So, let's divide 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4. This means that Rebeka can make 4 groups of 5 eggs each. Now, let's count how many more eggs Rebeka has than toy cars: 20 - 6 = 14. So, Rebeka has 14 more eggs than toy cars.
Response:  We know that Rebeka has 5 toy eggs and 12 real eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20 people, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs. To do this, we will use division. Division is when you divide a number by another number to get the number of groups you want. In this case, we are dividing 12 (the number of real eggs) by 20 (the number of people in each group). So, if we divide 12 by 20, we get 0.6. This means that Rebeka can make 0.6 groups of 20 people using her 12 real eggs. Since each group needs one toy egg, Rebeka has 5 toy eggs left over after making 0.6 groups of 20 people. Therefore, Rebeka has more real eggs than toy eggs. The difference between the number of real eggs and toy eggs is 12 - 5 = 7. So, Rebeka has 7 more real eggs than toy eggs.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and won 11 points in each round, then he played ${{154 \div 11 = 14}$$ rounds$.
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a trivial game and accumulated 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

Total score = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 177 x 46
= 8,322 points
Therefore, Luke has scored 8,322 points in the game."
"Response:  If Luke has scored 84 points after two rounds of a trivial game and he scores the same number of points each round, then we can find out how many points he scored in each round as follows:

Let X be the number of points Luke scored in the first round. Since he scored 84 points overall, the total number of points he scored is 84 = 2X + X.

We know that Luke scored 84 points in the second round, so the number of points he scored in the second round is 84 - 2X.

Now we have two equations: 2X + X = 84 and 84 - 2X = 84. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

X = 40.

Therefore, Luke scored 40 points in the first round and 40 - 2(40) = 16 points in the second round."
Response:  If Luke has scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he has scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in the entire game. Therefore, the correct answer is 21,982 points.
Response:  If Luke has scored 3 points in each round of the game and has scored a total of 78 points, then he must have played for x rounds. We can write an equation based on this information: 3x = 78... (1) Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3 : x = 78 / 3... (2) Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation gives us x = 26. So, Luke played for 26 rounds in the game with trivial puzzles and won 3 points in each round, resulting in a total score of 78 points.
"Response:  Emily had 2 perls and wanted to make 32 bracelets for her friends. Since each bracelet requires one pearl, we need:

Number of bracelets = Number of perls x Required per bracelet
= 2 perls x 1 per bracelet
= 2 bracelets
Therefore, there were 2 perls needed for each bracelet."
"Response:  If Emily made 11 ohridis with perls for her friends and each ohridi has 28 perls, then...

The total number of munists = Number of ohridis x Number of perls in each ohridi
= 11 x 28
= 308

Therefore, there are 308 munists in total."
Response:  Емили прави огърлици с перли for her friends. Each ogrlic has 8 perls, and Emily has 16 perls. So, to find out how many ogrlics she can make, we need to divide the number of perls she has by the number of perls in each ogrlic: Number of ogrlics = Total number of perls / Number of perls in each ogrlic  In this case, the total number of perls is 16 (the number of perls Emily has), and the number of perls in each ogrlic is 8 (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the number of ogrlics that Emili can make is: Number of ogrlics = 16 / 8 = 2 So, Emili can make 2 ogrlics with 8 perls each.
Response:  Emily made 18 ohrigliets and had 6 pearls. To make one ohriglit, she needed 3 pearls. So, in total, she needed 3 x 18 = 54 pearls to make all 18 ohrigliets.
"Response:  If Emily makes 4 ohridits and each ohridit is made of 5 munista, then...

Emily has 4 x 5 = 20 munista in total."
Response:  Emily has 6 perls and wants to make ohrlits for her 72 friends. Each ohrlit should have 3 perls. So, we need to divide 6 by 3 to find out how many ohrlits Emily can make: 6 / 3 = 2. Therefore, Emily can make 2 ohrlits for each of her 72 friends.
Response:  Emily had 43 friends and wanted to give them each a pearl necklace with 20 oval shapes. Since there were 5 pearls in total, we can calculate the number of oval shapes per pearl as follows: Number of oval shapes = Total number of oval shapes / Number of pearls = 20 / 5 = 4 So, Emily needed 4 pearls for each of her 43 friends to make 20 oval shapes.
Response:  Emily made 26 ohrigliets and each ohrigliet has 2 perli. So, in total, Emily has 26 x 2 = 52 perli.
Response:  We know that 819058 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 668278 stayed at home. So, we can write an equation: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children who went to camp = 819058 - 668278 = 150783. Therefore, more than twice as many children (150783) spent their summer vacation at camp compared to those who stayed at home (668278).
Response:  We know that 202958 children went to camp and 777622 remained at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than those who went to camp, we can use the following formula: Number of children remaining at home - Number of children going to camp = Difference in number of children So, in this case, the difference between the number of children staying at home and the number of children going to camp is: 777622 - 202958 = 574634 Therefore, there are 574634 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in the area around Lawrence.  During the summer vacation, 629424 children go to camp, leaving behind 268627 children at home. Therefore, the number of children who remain at home is 268627.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in the area of Lawrence. During summer vacation, 274865 children stay at home, which means that 38609 (313473 - 274865) children go to camp. Therefore, 38609 children attend the camp during the summer break.
Response:  We know that 907611 children from Lorman County stay at home during summer vacation, while 455682 children go to camp. So, we can write an equation: Number of children in Lorman County = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp. Now, let's solve for the number of children in Lorman County: Number of children in Lorman County = 907611 - 455682 = 451939 children. Therefore, there are 451939 children in Lorman County.
Response:  We know that out of 800059 children who went to camp, 74763 are left at home (800059 - 800059 = 0). So, the number of children remaining at home is 74763.
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in Lorain County, 61619 stayed at home while the remaining 30057 went to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, 30057 children from Lorain County went to summer camp.
Response:  We know that 34044 children from Lormans County went to camp and 134867 stayed at home. Additionally, 424944 children from outside the county attended the camp. So, we need to find out how many children attended the camp in total. To do this, we can use the information given in the question as follows: Total number of children who attended the camp = Number of children from Lormans County + Number of children from outside the county - Number of children from Lormans County who stayed at home = 34044 + (424944 - 134867) = 76585 On simplifying, we get the answer: 76585 children attended the camp.
Response:  We know that 610769 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 590796 children stayed at home. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is: 610769 + 590796 = 1201565. Since 22 children came from other towns, the total number of children in Lawrence County is actually 1201587.
Response:  We know that 644997 children from Lawrence County stayed at home during the summer vacation, while 893835 children went to camp. Additionally, 78 children from outside of Lawrence County attended the camp. So, we can calculate the total number of children in Lawrence County as follows: Total number of children = Number of children who stayed at home + Number of children who went to camp - Number of children from outside county who attended camp Total number of children = 644997 + 893835 - 78 = 721000 children Therefore, there are 721000 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has x - 3 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 9 - (x - 3)  Substituting x = 9, we get:  x - 3 = 9  Solving for x, we get:  x = 12  Therefore, Jackie has 12 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, in total, they have 10 + 2 = 12 apples. Therefore, Adam has more apples than Jackie.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So, the difference between their number of apples is:  9 - 10 = -1. Therefore, Djackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Dжаки has 10 jacks and Adam has 8 jacks. So, we need to find out how many more jackets Dжаki has than Adam. We can do this by subtracting the number of jacks that Adam has from the number of jacks that Dжаки has:  Number of jacks that Dжаки has - Number of jacks that Adam has = 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, Dжаки has 2 more jacks than Adam.
Response:  Adam and Jack have 6 apples between them. If they have 4 more apples than they had before, then they must have had 10 apples (6 + 4 = 10) altogether before. So, the total number of apples is 10.
Response:  If there are more than 9 apples together, then Adam and Jackie have at least 2 apples each (since they have 7 apples between them). So, in total, there are 9 + 2 = 11 apples.
Response:  Adam and Jack have 12 apples in total. If they have 9 more apples together, then Adam has 8 more apples than Jack (since he has 12 - 9 = 3 more apples). So, Adam has 8 + 8 = 16 apples. Therefore, there are 16 + 12 = 28 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie and Jackie has 10 apples. So, Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples. Since they have two apples together, there are 14 + 2 = 16 apples in total. Therefore, Adam has 16 - 6 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 5 apples and Djacki has 89 portakals and 11 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Djacki has from the total number of apples that Adam has, we will get the number of apples that Adam has. Therefore, the answer is 5 + (Adam's total number of apples - Djacki's total number of apples).
Response:  Yesterday Hellen baked 31 biscuits, today she has already baked 270 more, and before yesterday she had baked 419 more. So, in total, Hellen has baked 620 biscuits until now.
Response:  Yesterday (independently of the day), Hellen made 90 chocolate biscuits. Today, she is making more biscuits and has already made 51 with grapes. So, in total, Hellen has made 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate biscuits today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 527 chocolate biscuits and 86 stadiums. Today, she has baked 86 sweet sticks and 554 chocolate chip cookies. To find out how many chocolate biscuits Helen made yesterday, we can subtract the number of chocolate chip cookies she made today from the total number of biscuits she made yesterday: 527 - 554 = -27. So, Helen made 27 chocolate biscuits yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday (the day before Thanksgiving), Hellen baked 144 chocolate biscuits and 397 grapes. Today (Thanksgiving Day), Helen made 85 strawberry sweets and 403 chocolate chip cookies. So, to find out how many strawberry sweets Helen made today, we can subtract the number of strawberry sweets she made yesterday from the total number of sweets she made today: 85 - 39 = 46. Therefore, Helen made 46 strawberry sweets today.
Response:  Yesterday (in the past), Hellen baked 19 chocolate biscuits. Today, she is planning to bake more biscuits for Thanksgiving dinner. The total number of biscuits she plans to bake today is: 231 + 237 = 468 biscuits. So, Hellen has made 240 more shcolocaodov biscuits than she did yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday (in the past), Hellen baked 197 chocolate biscuits and 46 grapes. Today, she baked 75 sugar cookies and 66 chocolate chip muffins. To find out how many more chocolate biscuits Hellen baked yesterday compared to today, we can subtract the number of chocolate chip muffins she baked today from the number of chocolate biscuits she baked yesterday: 197 - 66 = 131 So, Hellen baked 131 more chocolate biscuits yesterday than she did today.
Response:  Yesterday, Hellen made 280 sour candies and today she made 359 chocolate chip cookies. So, the difference between yesterday's number of sour candies and today's number is: 359 - 280 = 79. Therefore, Hellen made 79 more sour candies than she did yesterday.
Response:  Katy has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katy has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katy has: 81 - 59 = 22. So, Katy has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  Katy has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now let's consider Katy's old friends. They have 53 games in total. Therefore, all of Katy's friends together have 179 (Katy's new friends) + 53 (Katy's old friends) = 232 games.
Response:  Katy has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  Kate has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19 = 103).  Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69 = 77).  Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77 = 180).
Response:  Katy has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 62 + 80 = 142 games.  Her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so they have a total of 73 + 41 = 114 games. Therefore, there are 142 - 114 = 28 old games.
Response:  Katy has played 63 games more than her friends have played. So if her friends have played 57 games, then she has played 63 - 57 = 8 games more. Therefore, Katy has played 8 more games than her friends.
Response:  Katy has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Her friends have 34 new games, which means they have a total of 34 games as well.  Therefore, Katy has more games than her friends - 96 vs 34 = 62 more games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19 at the beginning of the week. Then, Jason spent money on washing his car over the weekend and now has $33. So, if Jason spent money on washing his car, he must have earned $33 - $19 = $14 during that time. Therefore, Jason spent $14 on washing his car.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. So together they had $91 ($86 + $5). Then, Fred spent money on gas and now has $9. Therefore, the total amount of money they have is $100 ($91 + $9).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 at the beginning of the week and Jason had $16. Then, they spent money for something (not specified) and now Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So, to find out how much money Fred earned during the week, we need to subtract what he had at the beginning from his current amount: $40 - $19 = $21. Therefore, Fred earned $21 during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and now he has $21, so he spent $93 during the weekend.  Next, we know that Jason had $22 initially and now he has $78, so he earned $56 during the weekend.  Therefore, the amount of money Jason spent during the weekend is $56 - $22 = $34.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and spent $26 on washing his car (he made $89). Now he has $115. Secondly, Jason had $40 and earned $4 from delivering newspapers, so now he has $44. Therefore, the total amount of money they both gained is: $89 + $4 = $93. So, Fred gained $93 from washing his car, and Jason gained $4 from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $49 and spent $20 on gas for his car, so he now has $49 - $20 = $29.  Next, Jason had $3 and earned $50 from delivering newspapers, so he now has $3 + $50 = $53.  Therefore, the total amount of money that was earned from delivering newspapers is $53 - $29 = $24.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $78 last week and now he has $90 after delivering newspapers. So, his gain is $90-$78= $12.  Next, we know that Jason had $31 last week and now he has $14 after doing some work. So, his gain is $14-$31=-$17. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both boys through their respective activities is $12+(-$17)= $5.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 at the beginning of the week and gave away $16 for selling newspapers, so he now has $33 - $16 = $17. Then, he earned $74 from mowing lawns, which is added to his remaining balance of $17, making it $17 + $74 = $91. Therefore, FRED SPECHELI $91 PARIS PER WEEKEND.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and gave away $111 for delivering newspapers. So, his remaining amount is: $47 - $111 = $-64. Then, he mowed lawns for $34, so his new balance is: $-64 + $34 = $30. Therefore, FRED HAS $30 NOW.
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 71 kilograms (kg). Every day, she ran and lost weight at a rate of 20 kg per day. After running for x days, her weight decreased to 51 kg. So, x = 71 - 20 = 51 days. Therefore, Jessie now weighs 51 kg.
Response:  Before Jessi started running every day, she weighed 27 kg (150 lbs). After running for a month, her weight decreased by 101 kg (223 lbs), so her new weight is: 27 + (-101) = 16 kg (35.2 lbs). Therefore, before starting to run, Jessi weighed 27 kg or 16 pounds more than she did after running for a month.
Response:  Before Jessie started running every day, she weighed 126 kg (as stated in the problem). If she has lost 126 - 66 = 60 kg since then, that means she was initially 66 kg + 60 kg = 126 kg. So, her initial weight before starting to run every day was 126 kg.
Response:  Before Jessi started running every day, she weighed 69 kg (152 lbs). After starting to run daily, she lost 35 kg (77 lbs) of weight. So, her current weight is: 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg (75 lbs)
Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 kg. Then she started running every day and lost weight as follows:  In the first week, she lost 50 kg, so her new weight was 64 kg (114 - 50).  In the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so her current weight is 28 kg (64 - 60). Therefore, Jessie now weighs 28 kg.
Response:  Before Jessi started running every day, she weighed 9 kg (according to the question).  During the first week, she lost 62 kg, which means her new weight was 9 + (-62) = 31 kg.  During the second week, she lost another 140 kg, bringing her total weight loss to 140 - 62 = 78 kg. So, before starting to run, Jessi weighed 31 kg.
Response:  After one week of running every day, Jessie loses weight as follows:  Week 1: -56 kg = 92 kg / 7 days = 13 kg/day  Week 2: -99 kg = 92 kg / 7 days = 14 kg/day Therefore, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed 108 kg (92 kg + 16 kg).
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in the zoo and 61 alligators. If we assume that each snake needs to be covered equally with alligators (which is not necessarily true), then we can calculate the number of alligators needed as follows: Number of alligators = Total number of snakes / Number of alligators per snake = 95 / 2 = 47.5 alligators. So, approximately 48 alligators would be needed to cover the same amount of space as 95 snakes.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 alligators in total. If 40 of them hide, then we have to divide the remaining number of alligators by 40. So, if 40 alligators hide, then the other 57 (97 - 40) do not hide.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If we add 82 more snakes to the enclosure, then the total number of snakes will be 3 + 82 = 85 snakes. Now, let's find out how many alligators can fit in the enclosure if 85 snakes are added to it. According to the question, each snake takes up 1/4 of the space in the enclosure, so the total area of the enclosure is 75 x 4 = 300 square meters. Therefore, the number of alligators that can fit in the enclosure is 300 / 4 = 75 alligators. So, there are 75 alligators in the enclosure after adding 85 snakes to it.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the zoo enclosure.  If 24 of them are snakes and 51 are alligators, then we can calculate the number of remaining animals as follows:  Number of remaining animals = Total number of animals - Number of snakes - Number of alligators  = 79 - 24 - 51  = 34 So, there are 34 animals left in the enclosure after the snake and alligator have hidden themselves.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden and took 134 of them. So, he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left from yesterday. Today, he takes 30 more tomatoes, so he will have 37 - 30 = 7 tomatoes left after today.
Response:  If the farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and took 56 of them away, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden today.
Response:  If he took 154 do...
Response:  If the farmer has collected 172 carrots and he had initially 77 carrots in his garden, then he must have had 94 carrots left after collecting 172 (since 77 + 94 = 172). Now, we know that the total number of do
Response:  If the farmer had 177 do
"Response:  We know that the farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden initially. If he collected 137 tomatoes, then we can calculate how many tomatoes are left as follows:

Total number of tomatoes = Number of green tomatoes + Number of red tomatoes
= 105 + 71
= 176

So, there are 176 tomatoes remaining in the farmer's garden after collecting 137 tomatoes."
Response:  John uses 4 pliers to cut large wooden planks. Each plank requires 2 pieces of pliers to be fastened. Therefore, if John needs to cut X number of planks for the wall of his house, he will need 2X pieces of pliers in total. So, the answer is 2X.
Response:  John needs 13 large dishes for the wall of his house. Each dish requires 17 pieces of parquetry to be nailed. Therefore, John needs 13 x 17 = 201 pieces of parquetry for the large dishes alone. However, some smaller boards also require nails. So, in addition to the 201 pieces of parquetry needed for the large dishes, John needs 8 more pieces for the smaller boards, making a total of 209 pieces of parquetry needed for the wall of John's house.
Response:  John uses 11 pliers to cut large wooden planks from wood. Each plank requires 3 pliers for fastening, and an additional 8 pliers are used. To determine how many planks John needs for the wall of his house, we can use the following calculation: Number of planks = Total number of pliers / Number of pliers required per plank Therefore, the number of planks John needs is: Number of planks = 11 pliers / 3 pliers per plank = 37 planks So, John needs 37 planks for the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that John has to use 12 big and 10 small planks for the fence. If we assume that each big plank requires 3 nails (since there are 12 of them), then John needs 36 nails in total for the big planks. Now, if each small plank requires 2 nails (since there are 10 of them), then John needs an additional 20 nails for the small planks. Therefore, the total number of nails needed by John is 36 + 20 = 56 nails.
"Response:  We know that John uses large wooden boards to build his house and each board requires 2 pieces of plywood for attachment. Therefore, we need to calculate how many pieces of plywood John needs for all 16 boards. So, the number of plywood needed is:

16 boards x 2 pieces per board = 32 pieces of plywood

Therefore, John needs 32 pieces of plywood for building the wall of his house."
Response:  John needs to attach 8 dishes of wood to the wall of his house. Each plate requires 74 pieces of glue. Therefore, in total, John needs 74 x 8 = 576 pieces of glue for all plates.
Response:  We know that John needs to use 12 big dishes and 17 small dishes for the wall of his house. Each large plate requires 14 pieces of glue, and each small plate requires 25 pieces of glue. So we need to calculate how many pieces of glue are needed in total. The number of large plates is 12, so we need 12 x 14 = 168 pieces of glue for them. And the number of small plates is 17, so we need 17 x 25 = 425 pieces of glue for them. Therefore, John needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 pieces of glue for the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that Robin has several packages of gum and each package contains 3 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = Total number of pieces of gum / Number of pieces in each package. In this case, the total number of pieces of gum is 42 (as given in the problem), and the number of pieces in each package is 3. Therefore, we can solve for the number of packages as follows: Number of packages = 42 / 3 = 14 packages. So, there are 14 packages of gum with Robin.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of gum. Each package contains 23 pieces of gum, so Robin has in total 43 x 23 = 1007 pieces of gum. Additionally, there are 8 extra pieces of gum, so the final answer is 1007 + 8 = 1015 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has several packages of gum with 7 pieces in each package. Since Robin has 6 packages of gum, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Total pieces = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package = 6 x 7 = 42 So, there are 42 pieces of gum in total. Now, let's find out how many packages Robin has: Packages = Total pieces / Number of pieces per package = 42 / 7 = 6 Therefore, Robin has 6 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and 13 packages of bonbons. Since each package contains 4 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Number of pieces of gum = 28 packages x 4 pieces/package = 112 pieces Number of pieces of bonbons = 13 packages x 4 pieces/package = 52 pieces Therefore, Robin has a total of 112 + 52 = 164 pieces of candy.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of dumplings and 45 packages of bonbons. Since each package contains 9 pieces, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of dumplings = 21 x 9 = 189
Number of bonbons = 45 x 9 = 405
Therefore, Robin has 189 dumplings and 405 bonbons in total."
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of bonbons. Since each package contains 6 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Number of pieces of gum = 28 packages x 6 pieces/package = 168 pieces Number of pieces of bonbons = 14 packages x 6 pieces/package = 84 pieces Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces.
Response:  If one machine can make 3 risi in 1 minute, then it will take 2 minutes to make 6 risi (since there are 6 - 3 = 3 more risi). So, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine works for 5 minutes. In one minute, it can make 4 risi. So, in 5 minutes, it can make 4 x 5 = 20 risi. Therefore, the answer is 20 risi.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 risks in total, and today it made 44 risks. So, if we divide the number of risks made yesterday by the time taken to make those risks, we get: Number of risks per minute = Total number of risks / Time taken to make them  Number of risks per minute = 9 / x (where x is the time taken to make one risk)  Now, we are given that the machine can make 3 risks in a minute. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation above: Number of risks per minute = 9 / x = 3  Solving for x, we get: x = 9/3 = 3 minutes  Hence, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday.
Response:  We know that yesterday the machine made 13 risks and today it makes 3 risks per minute. So, we can write an equation as follows: Yesterday, the machine made x risks in y minutes = 13. Today, the machine makes z risks in m minutes = 3. Now, we have two equations with two unknown variables (x and z). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: X = 20 minutes (yesterday) Z = 4 minutes (today) Therefore, the machine worked for 20 minutes yesterday and 4 minutes today.
Response:  We know that yesterday the machine made 9 risi and today it made 8 risi. So, there is a decrease of 1 risk from yesterday to today.  If we divide the number of risi made today (8) by the time taken to make them (in minutes), we get:  Number of risi made per minute = 8 /? = 0.75 ri/min Where? is the unknown value that we need to find out. Since the machine can make 2 risi in a minute, we have:  Number of risi made per minute = 2  Therefore, the machine worked for (8 - 1) = 7 minutes today.
"Response:  If one machine can make 3 risi in a minute and yesterday it made 4 risi, then today it made 8 risi. So, we have:

Minutes worked = (Number of risi made yesterday) + (Number of risi made today)
= 4 + 8
= 12 minutes
Therefore, the machine worked for 12 minutes."
Response:  If the machine can make 6 risi in one minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, then it made 6 x 12 = 72 risi yesterday. And if it worked for 14 minutes today, then it made 72 + 14 = 86 risi today. So, the answer is 86 risi.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine could make 6 risi in 5 minutes, so it made 30 risi (6 x 5). Today, the machine can make 12 risi in 12 minutes, so it made 144 risi (12 x 12). Therefore, the machine made 174 risi today (144 + 30).
Response:  If they won $165 in 5 days, that means they won $33 per day.
Response:  The game won $ 144 per day and was played for 22 days. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is: $ 144 x 22 = $ 3088.
Response:  The game earns $420 per day and lasts for 30 days, so it earns a total of $12600 ($420 x 30). Since they won $22 together with the game, their daily winnings are $12820 ($12600 + $22). Therefore, they win $12820 / 30 = $427 per day from the game.
Response:  The game won $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. So, we can calculate the total amount of money won as follows: Total = $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the correct answer is $756.
"Response:  The game earned $120 during the first 20 days of the carnival and $66 during the remaining 16 days. To find out how much it earned per day, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of days it was open:

Total earnings = $120 + $66 = $186
Number of days open = 46 days (20 + 16)

So, the game earned $186 / 46 = $4.07 per day during the first 20 days of the carnival."
"Response:  The game won $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days. To find out how much it earned per day during those last 57 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left (57):

$114 / 57 = $2

So, the game earned $2 per day during the last 57 days of the carnival."
Response:  According to the question, Lucia bought 10 packages of biscuits and 4 packages of cake. So far, she has bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages. Therefore, she still needs to buy 6 more packages of biscuits (since she wanted to buy 10 in total).
"Response: 
Lucy bought 4 boxes of biscuits, 22 boxes of cake, and 16 boxes of chocolate.  To find out how many packages of food she bought, we need to divide the number of each item by the number of packages in one box.  For example, if there are 4 cups of biscuits in one box, then Lucy bought 4 x 4 = 16 boxes of biscuits. Similarly, if there are 22 cups of cake in one box, then Lucy bought 22 x 22 = 480 boxes of cake. And if there are 16 cups of chocolate in one box, then Lucy bought 16 x 16 = 256 boxes of chocolate. Therefore, Lucy bought a total of 16 + 480 + 256 = 792 packages of food."
"Response: 
Lucy went to the store and bought 23 boxes of biscuits and several boxes of cake. In total, there were 27 packages of food in the store. So, Lucy bought 23/27 = 85% of all the food in the store."
"Response: 
Lucy went to the store and bought 2 boxes of biscuits and 12 boxes of cake. In total, she bought 14 boxes (2 + 12 = 14). Since each box contains 12 small packages, Lucy bought a total of 14 x 12 = 168 small packages of food. Therefore, the number of packaging bags with food is 168."
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. According to the problem statement, no more than 36 people can fit in one bus, so we have reached the maximum capacity of the bus. Therefore, the number of people in the bus right now is 16.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people left the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people inside the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people in the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were four people in the bus. Then, another 9 people got on the bus, so the total number of people in the bus now is 4 + 9 = 13.
"Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got on the train, so the total number of people now is:

11 + 8 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 people in the train currently."
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and a total of 676 people. To find out how many students attended the program, we need to divide the number of people who participated (676) by the number of parents (22). So, the answer is: 676 / 22 = 30.9%

* 724 students (S)
* 744 teachers (T)

Now we need to find out how many people are in total in the program. To do this, we multiply the number of parents, students, and teachers:

Total = P x S x T = 73 x 724 x 744 = 519,680

So there were approximately 519,680 people in the program."
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students. To find out how many more students attended than parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants (students + parents). So, the difference between the two numbers is: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there were 347 more students who attended the program than parents.
Response:  We know that there are 61 parents in the program and 177 students. If we divide the number of students by the number of parents, we get: $ \frac {177} {61} = 2$ adults per student. Therefore, if we assume that all the adults are teachers, then the total number of teachers in the program is: $ 44 = 2 \times 22 $ (since there are 2 teachers for every 2 students).
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to find out how far away from the entrance the end of the cave is. Since the height of the cave is equal to its depth (since it's a vertical shaft), we can say that the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is half of the total height of the cave. So, if the total height of the cave is 1307 feet, then the distance from the entrance to the end of the cave is half of that value, or 653.5 feet. Therefore, the end of the cave is 653.5 feet away from the entrance.
Response:  We know that the cave is currently 849 feet deep and they have traveled 269 feet so far. To find out how much more they need to travel, we can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed is 17 feet per minute, which means they are moving at a rate of 17 feet every minute. So, if they continue to move at this rate, it will take them (Time) = (Distance / Speed) = (849 - 269) / 17 = 580 minutes to reach the end of the cave. Therefore, they still have 580 minutes or 9 hours and 40 minutes left to go.
Response:  We are currently at 659 feet and need to go down another 762 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, in total, we have to go down 762 - 659 = 83 feet more.
Response:  We know that initially Peyge had 8 goldfish in the lake and then she fed them to the stray cats, leaving 6 goldfish behind. So, we can say that the number of goldfish left after feeding is equal to the initial number minus the number of fish fed to the stray cats. Therefore, the answer is: Number of goldfish left = Initial number - Number of fish fed to stray cats = 8 - 2 = 6
Response:  Peyge had 7 goldfish and 12 cats in the lake initially. The stray cats liked to eat them, so now there are only 15 left (including both fish and cats). Therefore, the number of goldfish that disappeared is 7 - 15 = -8.
Response:  Peyge had 16 goldfish and 71 cats in the lake. The stray cats liked to eat them, so now there are only two left. To find out how many goldfish have disappeared, we need to subtract the number of remaining goldfish from the initial number. Therefore, the answer is: 16 - 2 = 14 goldfish have disappeared.
Response:  Peyge has 15 goldfish in Lake X, and 5 of them are eaten by stray cats. So, we have 15 - 5 = 10 goldfish left in the lake.
Response:  We started with 43 jabokles and made several batches of jam. After that, we had 2 jabokles left. So, in total, we used 41 jabokles to make the jam (43 - 2 = 41).
"Response:  If he had initially 58 apples and made several batches of apple pies, then after each batch, he used 35 apples to make more pies. So, the number of apples left after making n batches is given by:

Apples remaining = Initial apples - (Initial apples x Number of batches) / 35

Now, we are asked to find out how many apples will remain after n batches. To do this, we need to substitute the value of n into the formula above:

Apples remaining = 58 - (58 x n) / 35

Solving for n, we get:

n = 10

So, there will be 23 apples remaining after 10 batches (or 76% of the initial amount)."
"Response:  If he had 40 apples and made several batches of jam using 3/4 of each apple (which is what it means when they say ""няколко пайове""), then after making those batches, he would have used 30 apples (since 3/4 x 40 = 30). So, there are still 10 apples left over (40 - 30 = 10)."
Response:  Adam can store 11 action figures in each shelf, and there are 4 shelves in total. So, he can store 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in his room. Since his room has 4 rafts, he can store 44 x 4 = 176 action figures on all of them. Therefore, Adam can hold 176 action figures on his rafts.
Response:  Adam can put 10 action figures in each shelf in his room. Since he has enough space for 8 action figures in his room, we know that he has 2 extra shelves to store the remaining 2 action figures. Therefore, there are 2 rafts (shelves) in Adam's room.
"Response:  Adam can collect 8 figures and 10 chests in each of the 4 rafts in his room. Therefore, he can gather a total of:

8 x 4 = 32 figures
10 x 4 = 40 chests
So, altogether, Adam can gather 72 objects (32 figures + 40 chests) in his room."
Response:  We have 10 gardens with 544 gourds in each garden. So, we have 544 x 10 = 5440 total gourds. Now, each gourd contains 32 flowers, so we have 5440 x 32 = 176880 flowers altogether. Therefore, there are 176880 flowers in all 10 gardens combined.
Response:  We know that there are 466 gourds in total. Each gourd contains 53 flowers and 181 twigs. So, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of flowers = Total number of gourds x Number of flowers per gourd = 466 x 53 = 24,980 flowers Now, let's calculate the number of twigs: Number of twigs = Total number of gourds x Number of twigs per gourd = 466 x 181 = 87,360 twigs Therefore, there are 24,980 flowers and 87,360 twigs in total.
Response:  We have:  Number of containers = 141  Number of flowers in each container = 71  Total number of flowers =? To find out how many total flowers there are, we need to multiply the number of containers by the number of flowers in each container:  Total number of flowers = 141 x 71 = 9630  So, there are 9630 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that in each of the 5 baskets there are 40 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is: 5 x 40 = 200 flowers. Since we were told that there are altogether 400 flowers, it means that the remaining 200 flowers must be in one basket only. Therefore, the answer is: 1 basket.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in Stephen's collection and 4276 tires. Since we want to find out how many groups of each size there are, let's divide both numbers by the number of groups we want (in this case, 154). So, we will have: Number of skittles / Number of groups = Number of skittles per group Number of tires / Number of groups = Number of tires per group Now, let's calculate these two ratios: Number of skittles per group = 4502 / 154 = 29  Number of tires per group = 4276 / 154 = 28 Therefore, there are 29 groups of skittles with exactly 15 skittles in each group, and 28 groups of tires with exactly 16 tires in each group.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 skittles in Stephen's collection and he has 4950 gumballs. If we divide the number of skittles by the number of groups (495), then each group will have how many skittles?  So, the size of each group is:  Number of Skittles = Total number of Skittles / Number of Groups = 3941 / 495 = 7.86 skittles per group.
Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in Stephen's collection and he also has 517 gumballs and 90 lollipops. If we divide these into groups of 8, then: Group 1 will have 89 skittles (8 x 112 = 896). Group 2 will have 43 gumballs (8 x 5 = 43). Group 3 will have 11 lollipops (8 x 1 = 11). So, there are 89 skittles, 43 gumballs, and 11 lollipops in each group.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in the school and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class Total number of students = 304 x 75 Total number of students = 22,550 students. Therefore, there are 22,550 students in the school.
