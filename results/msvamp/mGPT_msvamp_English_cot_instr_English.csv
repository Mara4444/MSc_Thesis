"Response:  1) What is your average number of games you have done? 2) How often do they last for each game in total (for example if there are 3 or 4 players playing at once).3) If we had to choose between two different types of cards from one set then what would be their best choice(s): A card that has only three colors; B which can hold up all four colours but does not contain any coloring material other than red/green etc.; C wherein every player plays an entire deck without having ever dealt anything else beforehand..4) Which type was chosen as ""best"" because it contains no colored materials such as black ink...5) The most common way people use these numbers when calculating scores ----they divide them into multiple parts so everyone gets equal points.-----The first part gives us our score based upon whether someone will get 10%+points while another person receives 20%. Then after this division comes next section called scoring percentage! This tells us about who wins outright,who loses outright...and also shows some important things like :1st place = 100%,2nd Place= 50%-50%; thirdplace= 25%-25 % ; fourth places= 15%-15 %.

"Response:  1) Bobbys first piece was about 2 ounces and his second one is 3/4 cups (about 4oz).

But my mom told me ""it depends"" which means something like 10-15% or less depending upon your age..but i'm sure most people will say 20%. So let us assume our child gets up around 7am every morning for breakfast with only 5 minutes left before lunch time ---and after dinner comes out hungry again until 8pm --so why does anyone want them to be able to feed themselves without having their teeth chewed off each other during nap times...or even just sit down together while watching TV instead of sleeping through midnight hours!So here are two numbers :1 = 12 + 6= 24+6= 36(a little bit too big...)If someone says 30%, please explain further.-----> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QYxqXwZj0A&feature=related";
Response:  Bobbys total is 372 and his average number for each piece was 2 (2 = 1). The numbers are given in brackets to help you understand what happened next! Answers from other students can be found here : http://www.maths-onlinehelpdesk/questions_answere...eat=3&typeofcandytotal=1;
Response:  Bobbys total number is 3346 (3x33). He has three different types of food in his diet - fruit, vegetables & meat.....Bobbi had to consume at least one type each day for 6 months before eating any other foods because it was not allowed him from time till now! What kind of fruits do you have? Which are your favorite ones that can be eaten with no problems or complications like sugar etc... How much does this amount mean if we take into account all these things as well! Doesn't matter what sorts they were consumed but still there will always come some problem when someone comes up against them due to their lacking knowledge about nutrition!! So let us look back over our daily routine so far : 1) We start off every morning having breakfast 2 ) After lunch drink water while doing exercises which helps digestive system work properly after exercise 5-7 minutes later drinking milk instead 7-)After dinner get ready 8)-Get outdoors 10%) Get dressed 11% 12%-Go shopping 13 % 15 %) Go swimming 16/17 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 234 235 236 238 »;
Response:  Bobbys total is 3366 and his number in this game was 3700 (3+1=4). Bobby has been eating 6667 chips since Christmas Eve last year! How much does it take to get him back into shape? Answers are given below for each level as well : 1)Bobbi hadn't eaten any food before December 31st 2)He didn’t have time or energy at all during that period 4)His body wasn’t ready yet 5)The amount you can count depends upon your own ability but I would say about 10-15% if not 20%-30%) If we assume there were no other foods left after 12/31th, what do they weigh up nowadays when compared with those days prior which include New Year`s Day etc... What will be their weight today based off these numbers.. Please help me out!! Thank You very Much!;
Response:  Bobbys total is 352 (3+1) = 369(4). Bobby has 3366 + 1=3706 points and his score for this game was 4/5 stars!;
Response:  1) Bobby has 11 piece(s). 2) He is eating 6 (6+1=9), 3) His body weight was 4 pounds and his height at birth was 7 inches tall.....4 + 8 = 12? Answers : 13 Bobbys total calories are 1400 Cal/day which equals to about 10% less than what you would eat if your baby were healthy! How much do we need for each day in order that our bodies can function properly without having an excess amount of food stored inside them or even getting sick from it all!! Please help us with this quiz so I know my answers correctly as well because they will be very important when trying out new foods like these! Thank You For Your Help;

"Response:  1) What is Bobbys number? (2 points). How much do you know about him and his family members in this situation(3-5 point each): A.) He has been living with relatives for over 20 years B.). His parents are deceased C.), They live together D), Their children were born to them E).""Bob"" was 18 when they met at school.""Daddy"", 17,""Mom"". ""Papa"",""Sister""........and so forth.(6 -10point per line)(7+1=9)-What did Bobby eat during that time period?""He eats only one piece every day""(8 + 5 = 10)""I don't like eating anything else""-How long ago it happened?"". Answers:""It took me almost two months before I realized what my father really wanted from us.""""We didn’t want any more money""""You can buy everything we need now"""". The next sentence will be an example where your child says something similar but without using numbers or letters.-Doesn' t matter if there isn's no other way out! You just say yeah!!!""If not then why would she go back home again?"", asks her mother after hearing all these questions."". If someone tells their son/daughter,that nobody wants food because everyone likes chocolate...then maybe its true...""No problem!"". This statement should help explain some things such as : Why doesn ‘s mom keep buying stuff everyday while Daddy keeps shopping around instead of going away alone till morning hours which makes life easier since Mom gets up early enough to get ready herself etc.,etc.; It also helps understand who needs whom; Who cared whether people liked chocolates too ;Who could afford expensive clothes even though most kids wear cheap ones! And finally make sure those words mean nothing unless asked directly through text messages.:-)";
"Response:  Bobbys total is 16 and his number in this game was 2 (2 = 1). Bobby can't have more than one piece at any time because there are no numbers to count for each item that comes into play during an entire round! If you want your child to be able to do all these things without having trouble with their math skills then they should start playing games like ""Bobble"" or other similar ones where it will help them learn about addition/subtraction as well as multiplication so we could figure out what kind of problem our children face when trying to solve problems involving adding up multiple items from different places within another box.....and also make sure every player knows exactly which boxes were filled beforehand!!";
Response:  1) Bobby has 3362+3371=4356 2).Bobbys total is 4345 + 3450 = 5457 (he can't count his own numbers because they are not in each other order.) Bobs number was 3556 and it would be possible to get him back into this game with only one piece remaining but that will take time as well since there were no new items added at all during playtime so we need some extra help from our friends who know what their problems might look like when trying again.....and also remember you cannot beat yourself up for missing something!;
"Response:  1) Bob is now in his 20th birthday and has 3183 piece(s). 2) He was given an invitation to eat at one restaurant for $10 each (the total cost would be about 4 dollars), but when asked what type of food they were going to serve him with, Bobby said ""cake"" which means that it will not taste like chocolate or anything else except maybe some kind of frosting/cream cheese mixture.....but then again this could also mean something other than just eating out! So we can say there are no more items available from restaurants as far back as today!! What do you guys want? If I am wrong please correct me so i know where my mistake came down :D Thanks!";

"Response:  1) Jake had 4 ballots for his party; he got them from everyone who came out of school at least once during their day (each person was given one vote). Then we will divide each individual into two groups - those that received votes but didn't get any balls or were not able to attend because they couldn’t come home until after midnight – then let us count down till 10pm when it is time to go back again! The first group gets 5 points while the second receives 6-7points!!

Response:  1) What is your number of ballots? 2) How much do you know about each vote counting system (each ballot has its own unique value). The following are some examples from my math class that I used for this assignment : - A student who was given an incorrect amount of votes will be asked if he/she can correct it with his or her knowledge as well as using their skills..... If they cannot find out what percentage were wrong,then there would not even exist any problem because no one knows them! So we need only use our mathematical abilities when solving problems!!

"Response:  1) Jake had 4 ballots for each of his friends (2+3=6). He got 5 from everyone else except himself who was not invited because he didn't want anybody at home with him so that they could get their own tickets instead! Then we can see what happens when you add up your number as well? If it is 7 or 8 people getting together but only one person gets into an elevator - does this mean everyone has been given two seats left over after last time someone came out first before anyone went inside again until next year?) So let us assume Jakes total numbers are 9 + 12 = 24; therefore 10-24 means 11 balls were purchased per friend(s), which equals 14 times less money spent compared to just buying three additional ones!! Now consider our situation wherein I am going shopping tomorrow morning...I will be spending $10/balloon ($5 x 100% ) plus my other expenses such as gasoline etc..So now imagine me having four extra dollars saved while still being able to buy five different types of balloon sizes like these : A B C D E F G H L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0";
Response:  1) How much time do you have to learn English? (2h/day). What is your average amount of study for each language in this period(1-3 years?) If I were studying Chinese at least 3 months per week then my total would be about 4 hrs /week => 8hrs x 12 weeks= 16 hourly days + 7x12 weekly workdays+ 5 working nights or less! This means that if we take into account all these factors it will give us an approximate figure which can help determine our daily spending rate :-) The following table shows what percentage are spent during one month with only two languages spoken ---Chinese &English --and also gives some examples from other countries where students studied both foreigners as well!;

"Response:  1) How much time do you have to learn English? (2h/week). If your average is 3 hrs per week then it would be about 4-5hrs each hour for reading Chinese books or watching TV in China; 5 -6 Hr /day = 8Hours of study + 6 Hours spent studying+1 Hour working=8HR(hourly)/7 days x 12 weeks = 2400 HR.(24000*12wk)(4x3y0d ) Answers : A total amount that can easily fit into one month’s salary range will not exceed 2000 – 2500 RMB ($2000–2550 USD), but this may vary depending upon individual circumstances such as family size etc.. The most common reason people are unable to earn enough money at home due to lacking work experience could also include poor health conditions like diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure & heart disease which makes them less likely to get employed after graduation from university because they don't know what their future career path looks like before going back out there with no job prospects available!";

"Response:  1) How much time do you have to learn English? (2-5 hrs.) ==> 3/4 of your total work is spent studying Chinese language; 4% - 10 % are devoted reading books or watching movies ; 20%-30% will be spending more than 30 minutes per week doing homework at home with friends etc..... If we take into account that each person has different needs then it would appear as follows : **1 hour study + 15 min working out daily**(3hours+15minutes)/6hrs x 12 weeks = 8 months / year! The average amount required from one student can vary between 7 years old upwards but most students need only about 9months before they start their studies again after finishing school! So what should I expect when i say ""study"" because my parents want me not just finish college,but also get good job opportunities like teaching children who don't speak any foreign languages... so why did this matter since there was no such thing called ''workingout'. What kind of training program could help us improve our skillset while improving communication skill level among people around them which maybe even make some new friendships come true through social network sites where everyone knows someone else better!! Thanks very much";
"Response:  1) How long do you have to learn English? 2) What is your average time spent studying Chinese language each week (in minutes). 3) Which of these two languages are most important at this point during his life as an adult person or child/adult learner(s), especially when it comes to foreign countries such as China where there isn't much education available yet? ANSWER : The first three questions will be based upon what we know about our own personal experiences with different cultures; however they can also apply directly into other situations that may arise from reading books written either beforehand or afterward through various media sources like newspapers etc.. In addition, some people who study abroad often find themselves having difficulties understanding their native culture because not only did I speak very little French but my mother spoke so few words! Therefore one should always try harder than others! If possible choose something which has been translated onto another tongue rather then just read any book without knowing its meaning ; otherwise students might get confused while trying out new vocabulary concepts due to lacking familiarity between them both...

"Response:  1) What is your number? (2 points). If you have 3 or 5 numbers then what do they mean to me when I say ""3"" because it means that three people can be together forever! But this does not make sense as we know two persons cannot live with one another at any time so why wouldn't someone want their partner back after having been separated from them once again!! So let us assume our partners were married before marriage but now both parties divorced themselves.....how will these new couples get along without being apart since neither party wants anyone else around him/her anymore except his wife who loves her husband very much too! How about my friends, family members etc...who also love mine like crazy right away :( Why should i tell everyone anything bad just saying something good instead than telling everything negative which makes things worse even though its true ;-) Answers provided below may help others understand better";

"Response:  1) What is your number of bookshelves? (2-3)...(4+5=7 )......and what are you doing with them nowadays! How much do they cost each year for new or used items that have been bought recently from stores like WalMart etc., as well as those purchased at department store outlets such as Target & Walmart, Costco Wholesale Stores -------> $1/book =$0.50 per item!! I am not sure if this means we should be buying all our old stuff but it does mean there will always still some things left over after years when people buy their own furniture because most shops don't sell anything until someone else has sold something beforehand so why wouldn't everyone want one thing right away instead of waiting till another person sells everything first then selling again just once every few months since these days where customers can get ridiculously cheap goods without having any problems getting back into shopping centers which usually take hours long due to traffic congestions especially during rush hour periods!

So now let me ask another simple math problem which will give us an idea why some animals cannot be seen because our eyes aren’t working properly --> Which animal has been spotted twice before today – A lion who hadn´t even eaten yet; B buffalo whose tails still hanging off its head ; C tiger`s necklace ………….(1 + 4 = 7 ). Now consider those three things again —–how much money would someone spend buying new clothes every day while doing nothing else except watching TV instead of going outside looking through windowsill trying not to catch any bugs etc.,etc.-—that makes sense too since most humans live far away from nature wherever possible. But maybe somebody wants something different than eating meat everyday rather than spending $$ per month shopping online whenever available.) Answers provided below";
Response:  1) How much is it that you have left? (2-3 pts.) What do they eat nowadays?(1 pt.). Which of these animals does not like being in your yard or garden when there isn't any other people around for their company at all! Doesn’t matter if we live near an airport, our house has no neighbors who can help us with anything else.....and so far I haven’t seen anyone doing this!! It seems as though everyone wants something different from what others want but nobody knows where exactly one will find out about its existence! So let me ask : Who would be able to tell whether someone was going through some sorts problem while living next door...or just walking into my home without even knowing why he/she lives here too late morning because his wife doesn´t come back till after midnight every day since she didn´t work until 6am everyday last week…I don´t know which way could explain such behavior …but maybe somebody should try asking him / her questions first before making decisions based only upon information gathered during conversations between friends etc., otherwise then things might get complicated later down the line;
Response:  1st Bird --------> 4 Stork = 5 Birds + 7 (Storke)= 8(birds). Step2 : The number of bird is increased from 9 upto 10 because there was no one left standing in front for all time.....Step3 : There will be two groups that have been waiting at each other till they get together again...they can't go back without their leader or guide, so it becomes very difficult if you want your group stay with another person until he/she gets along well enough before going out alone! Answers;
"Response:  1st bird is standing in front of his nest with 3 other bunnies, he has 5 eggs laid out for him (2-3) but they have not been able to get enough food so now it will be time that we start feeding again.....he wants some fresh fruit from our garden...we can feed all these animals together or each one needs their own meal? How much do you need yourself if I want my baby back home after having her born at night when she sleeps next day! Answers : The number needed depends upon what kind of animal(s). If there was only two people who could eat every single egg then this would require about 10 - 15 different kinds of foods per person depending on which type of creature/animals come into contact first; however as long as everyone eats well before eating anything else than meat etc., no matter whether its fishes chickens ducks cows sheep dogs rabbits antelope horses pigs goat cattle donkeys deer hogs elk lions tigers bears elephants monkey giraffas rats bats whales sharks dolphins sea otters penguins seabirds squirrels frogs lizards reptiles amphibians insects butterflies mothers' flocks parrots peacock feathers owls guinea pig rhino horned rhinos buffalo leopards zebras lionesses hyenas hippopotamus gorillas orangutans mongoose hippos kangaroo koalas gibbons cheetahs sloths baboon camelopardalis nilgai girafe dhole snakes spiders primates marsupial mammals mammalian species vertebrates aquatic plants flowering plant trees shrubs grasslands forest land vegetation water bodies rivers lakes oceans seas mountains desert plaines hills valleys forests savannah jungle savanna tropical rainforest wilderness areas deserts highland regions mountain ranges lowlands coastal plain cities towns villages rural districts urban centers suburbs countryside townscapes city streets houses buildings bridges roads railways tunnels railroads airports ports harbors port docks railway stations hotels resorts camps lodges motels campgrounds restaurants cafés bars pubs clubs shops markets shopping centres parks public places monuments churches temples mosques monasteries mausoleils palaces pagodoms temple tombs cathedhells caves grottoursaids cave ruins graves cavernacles mines fields farms farm lands pastures woods streams spr";
"Response:  1) How much bird is there in each of these four groups? 2) What number was left behind after all three animals had been killed (they have not yet arrived). The remaining two numbers will be added together as one group for this task; they must then add up until you get an exact figure that shows what total amount has remained from those five species!";
Response:  1st Bird --------> 4 Stork == 5 Birds +1 (2)Storke(3)......5+4...6/7 bird is standing in front of me, I am not able to see him because he has been lying down for long time but when i look at his face it looks like thats why we have so much trouble with our eyes :-( But if you can find out what happened then maybe this will help us solve your problem! Thanks!!;
"Response:  1) How much is it that you have left? 2) What was your number of birdies in each round (in this case 5). If there had been no one at all, what would be their total score for every single game played during those five rounds(5+1=6 )and if they scored 7 or 8 points then we could say ""7 +8 = 9"" which means 10 times as many Birdie-Punches per Game! So let us assume our numbers will not change because only two players can win any games with fewer Than One Birds In Each Round!! Now consider another example where three people play an entire tournament but do so without having anyone else playing : The first person who plays wins $10000 dollars while everyone else loses money! Which player has won most Money from his/her opponent since he started out winnings less than 100000 Dollars ($1000 -$2000), why does He lose More Cash From His / Her Opponent Since They Started Out Losing Less Then 1000 Dollar A Day And Who Is Winning Most Of Their Lives Because There Are No Other People Playing With Them All Together For That Time Period As Well........So We Can Say This Example Will Show You When To Stop Doubtful About Your Number On Fences Or Not Try It Again";
Response:  1) What is your number of birdies? 2) How much time did you spend in each position for every single one (1-4). 3) Which was last place at all times during that game with no errors or mistakes made when it happened again after 5 minutes from now until 10 seconds later.....(5+10=15 );
"Response:  1) How much is it that you have left? (2+5=7 ) 3/4 = 7 x 10-6 + 6x10 -3 / 8 = 0, so what does this mean for your total number of animals in each group : 9 or 11 if there was only one bird at all times then we would get 12 ; but since they had been standing still most days now their numbers will be increased upto 13 as well! So let us say our animal population has decreased from 14 today till 15 tomorrow because its not allowed any new ones come into town! Now consider another situation where two people live together with no children........they can't take care of themselves without help due to lacking food etc.,so why do these three persons stay alone when everyone else comes out every day looking after his family members who need him too!! What should I make about my problem please suggest me some solution which may solve mine";
Response:  1st Bird --------> 4 Stork = 5 Birds +6 More BIRDS (2)= 12Storks(4)......12+5x3y1z0... x y z 0 is equal to 10/10 or less? Then we have : 11*11 * 9 /9^7, which means that there will be 8 bird in each group of 7 people who sit next to one another at this time.(8 times as much ) So if you want your number from these numbers then it must not exceed 10000000! If so what do I need for my calculation please help me with maths questions!! Thank You very Much;

Response:  1st - What is your number of birdies? (2) Then you can find out what percentage each one has been in this game for that day! How much time did it take before they got back together again after all these years apart from their last meeting with me at school when I was just 5 or so old.....(3). Now let us look closer here : The numbers have changed since then but still there seems like an average amount per year between now until about 2025-2030 which means we will see some changes as well! So if today my son had only 4 Birdie he would be able to get up early tomorrow morning because his parents didn't want him home late night without having enough money left over!! But even though our children don’t know anything,they do understand everything…and sometimes things happen very quickly …so why not try something new every week instead of waiting till next month where everyone knows exactly who won first place……or maybe start playing games everyday rather than waiting til later tonight while watching TV etc...I hope someone could help explain better;
"Response:  1st Bird - The bird is standing in front of you with its head down (they're not looking at each other).

"Response:  1) What is your number of trees? (2-3)...(4+1=5),...and what does it mean to you that they have 5 leaves each year in their branches...what do we know about them as well?) 3.) How long has Rachel been growing her fruiting plants for this season so far - from seedlings through ripening into fruits or berries etc., all at once! She was able to grow up until 6 months ago when I told her ""I'm going back home"" because my husband wanted me out with him but he didn't want us leaving his house anymore!! He said if anything happened between our dates then i would be gone too :-( So let’s say today morning after having dinner together,Rachel asked “What time will tomorrow start” ……she replied ” Tomorrow”. Now tell me why can´t Tom go before 7pm! And also explain where exactly were those two little pigs sitting next door who could not get away without being caught trying to catch one another – which made sense since both girls live near here ;-) We went outside looking over the fields just like any other day except maybe more sunny than usual; however rain came down early enough last night making things look pretty much normal again……so yes its possible these days even though summer seems almost upon itself every single weekday afternoon/evenings weather should still show signs of improvement although only slightly better compared to previous years especially during wintertime due to snowfall & cold temperatures coming off very quickly while spring comes around sooner rather than later depending mostly on rainfall patterns such as fall /spring seasons usually starting earlier whereas most winters tend to come right along afterwards unless extreme conditions occur including heavy thunderstorms often occurring late evening hours sometimes midnight ) But no matter whether Rainy Day Morning Sunrise Sunset Weather Conditions Change Today Or Not It Will Be Different In The Next 24 Hours If You Have A Clue About This Then Please Share With Us On Facebook Like Our Page For More Information";
"Response:  1) The number is 6 2). If you want to know what percentage each fruit will be in size (apple), divide that amount into two equal parts so as not to over-reach your estimate for total weighted average value(WAAV): Approximately 4% = 8 oz/lb; 9 %= 12oz /lbs ; 10 %= 14ounce per lb.; 11 %= 16 pound per inch or more.....3%) Then multiply this figure with WAVE ratio whichever way works best!4%). Now take another piece out of an old basket then cut off one end leaving only halfway through its length where there would appear some sorts of ""fruit"" like strawberries etc., but don't worry because they're all gone!!5%), And finally add up any remaining fruits left at home using our calculator below :6%. This gives us approximate values based upon actual measurements taken during last year’s harvesting season when we were able to get enough rain before plantings started again…7%, So let me give these numbers exactly 0.01 percent accuracy!8"").

"Response:  1) The first one is not yet ready; there will be more than enough for you in your life (they're already grown). If they were allready mature then what would happen? You could get sick or die because someone else was eating them! Then why do we eat these things when our own food supply isn't as good at keeping us alive anymore...2) There maybe some other people who might want this fruit but don’t like their fruits so I guess that means something different..3) Someone wants another person too ----> This can also mean others needing help getting rid of themselves/someones possessions etc., which makes sense since most times everyone needs assistance right away!!4) Something happens somewhere between two extremes -- either somebody gets hurt while trying to save himself / herself...or both ends up being destroyed completely :-(5) A friend told me about ""The Tree"" – she said he had seen several trees around town where each branch contained only 3 leaves…and every leaf held 4 seeds …so perhaps 5 branches = 8 plants!6) It seems unlikely anyone ever saw any real “tree” before today ;-)7) In my opinion, no matter whether its true or false —–it depends upon whom—we choose ourselves accordingly8 ) What does God say regarding His creation through nature & mankind9.)

Response:  1) What is your number of trees?

"Response:  The number is 5 and you can see that there are 6 different types in this picture (apple) ----> 4+1=6 Apples = 3 +2*3/4(5). So if we add all these numbers together they will be 8! Then let us say for each type one or more fruits were found but not enough fruit was left so as far as I know no other kind had been discovered yet.....so what do people find? What does ""fruit"" mean exactly when asked about them...what would happen next time someone finds something else than just some random thing like an orange,or any sorts of nice looking things such as flowers etc., then why don't others discover those kinds too easily because most times only few varieties exist at once!! How could anyone possibly get rid off their own fears without having seen anything new beforehand which might lead into confusion later down the line! Why shouldn’t everyone learn quickly after finding out everything first hand rather than waiting until somebody discovers another variety sooner instead of trying hard every day till he learns nothing better even though his knowledge may seem good right away :-)";
Response:  1) What is your number? 2) How much are you going to save for this year and what will be next years budget in terms of money saved per tree (apple).3) If we take an average amount that would make it possible, then if I had 5 or 6 different types of fruit i could get my fruits at least twice as good than they did last time(i am not sure about other factors like climate etc.)4) Does anyone know where can find more information regarding these questions please help me out with some answers :D;
"Response:  1) What is your number? 2) How much does it cost to get one tree for every 10 people who are going there and then you can buy another 5 or 6 more at that price point 3). Which amount will be spent if we sell out our entire group (10+5=15 ), so 15% = $1/$2 + 25 % -25%. If I were selling my whole team off because they didn't want me as their leader but wanted someone else like myself with less experience than us would this result : 30-30%-20%, 20%-40%, 40%-50%; 50%-60 %. So what percentage do these numbers represent when looking into business models such as ""sales"" vs.""leadership"". The problem here was not whether sales represented 100 percent profitability; rather why shouldn’t leaders make sure everyone gets paid equally regardless of ability level! In other words – let’s say an organization wants its employees pay equal amounts based upon skills & knowledge levels…..what happens next after those individuals leave without paying any money back …they don’t even know where exactly “pay” comes from!! This leads directly towards creating new jobs which lead upwards toward higher profits while also increasing employee turnover rate since most companies only hire high skilled workers once per year instead of hiring low skillful ones throughout life time period(i am assuming some sort of training program etc.). Now consider two different situations i believe related to leadership development programs within organizations today ; firstly managers need help developing effective teams through coaching sessions followed by mentoring activities during regular meetings between staff members before starting work day again……and secondly management needs guidance regarding ways best fit individual talents together using various tools available online including eLearning courses offered via Google Classroom™";

Response:  1) How much did you lose in your first year? 2) What was it like to be an adult when he started playing with these stones and what were some other things that made him feel good about himself as well (like being able to walk around without shoes or wearing socks). 3) Did anybody else notice anything different from before they played together this time round because there are so few people who can see them all day long! 4) Do we know exactly where each stone is located but I would say its right next door - maybe one side has been moved away for years while another still exists today.. 5) If anyone could tell us which way every single marble came out then perhaps our answers will help someone understand why their children didn't get along very well during school days... 6 ) The last thing i want to hear after reading my questions/answers please give me feedback!!

Response:  What is your total income? (You can use this as an example.) If you are earning more than what I am paying for my house and car payments then that means it has been paid off in full! You will be able to deduct some of these expenses from his monthly salary if necessary but not all so we need only one dollar per month or less because there may still be other things going into him like medical bills etc.....

Response:  What is your total income? (You can use this as an example.) How many dollars do you have in cash and what are their value at each time period of one year or more years ago when they were purchased for less than that amount ($13)? If we assume all these items will be sold to someone else within two months after purchase date then our current net worth would equal approximately 2 million USD per month! Now consider if there was any other way out which could save us from losing those funds because it took longer before everything went back into circulation again but still saved them enough so I guess my overall financial situation should not change since most people don't need anything except food/drugs etc.....

"Response:  Zacharry does 4x4 and David is 5'10"" (height) so he has to be at least 6 inches taller for his height of 1/2 inch or less! How much weight should we put him down? If you are going with 2 pounds per pound then I would recommend that if your child weighs under 10 lbs they go up one ounce each time because it will help them get used to their new size as well!! Also remember when trying out different sizes there may not always fit everyone but try using what works best for yours.....I have tried several brands including Purefitness which was great before my son started training this year - just make sure its right sized too since some people can't even see where all those extra stiffening pads come from :(";

Response:  Zacharry does 52 of those things (push ups) with David only 12 times! How much time is it that he has to work out for each one? If you can't figure this down from your math teacher or someone else who knows what they're talking about then I'd suggest asking him/her if there are any other ways around his numbering skills so we could get some idea as well.....I'm not sure why anyone would want such an easy way though!!;

Response:  Zacharry does not have to be at least 35 pounds for his workout and he is only doing 15 minutes of cardio each day (which includes 10 reps). If you are going with him as an example I would say that it should take about 20 seconds per minute or so before your body starts working out again after all these steps! You can also add some weight lifting exercises like squats etc.....and then start adding new ones every few weeks until they become too much but still manageable!!;
"Response:  Zacharry had 36+1 (2x3) + 1(4 x 3). David was 37 (+ 2), so he would have done 39 = 46 total pull ups for his first day of workout! If you want to know what happened next week or when it will be over I suggest checking out my blog post ""How To Get Your Workouts Into A Smooth"" which is available at http://www.davidsfitnessblogger.com/2011/10/how_today__zacharya____and_michael__doesn't_have_a_pushup.....#ixzz5qXwJZYvc";
"Response:  Zacharys total body weight was 3'6"" tall with an average waist circumference of 1/2"". He had about 30 pounds to lose before he started training for his first competition at age 16 (he lost 20 lbs). His height is 5 feet 6 inches when measured from top right corner downwards; that would be around 2 ft 8in wide or 4ft 10ins long depending upon your measurement chart! If you were measuring him as high upright then it should have been closer together because there are no vertical lines between them so they don't look like one big piece - just two small pieces which can easily get caught off balance while moving forward without any problems.....If we take this into account now let us assume that all three muscles will work out fine after only 15 minutes each day during their normal activities such as walking etc., however once again I'm not sure what happened since my measurements didn't show much difference until later yesterday morning where i noticed some slight differences even though both men performed well enough throughout our session!! The reason why these changes occurred maybe due to muscle contraction? Or perhaps something else could also cause those movements apart from stretching too hardly anything other than getting tired doing nothing except standing still trying to keep calmness going through exercise...I guess its possible someone has misinterpreted me thinking ""this guy does everything wrong!"" But seriously imagine being able to move 100% straight ahead using every single movement imaginable including pulling backward onto floor level presses, squats & lunge exercises! What am I missing here please help :) Thanks";
"Response:  Zacharry does not have any of those moves at all! He has only one move that he can't perform because it is too difficult for him to get upright (he doesn't want his arms out). If you could give us an example where we would see this happening? What will be your number as well when someone asks ""how much longer are they going?"" You should say something like 1 minute or so before reaching their goal weight limit; otherwise people might ask what time was last week until she reached her target level...and then start asking questions about other things such as whether there were others who had done similar exercises with them during previous weeks..or even just why these newbies didn't complete each exercise correctly after first doing some basic ones earlier - which may explain its success rate.)";
Response:  Zacharry does not have any of those moves yet (he is only 6 months old). He has been doing them for about 3 weeks now so he can't really tell what they are all like or why it works better with him at this age.....I would say that his body needs to be able to handle these movements as well because there will always need some movement from your child when you start training new things! I am sure we could use helpful tips here too!! Thanks again :);

"Response:  1) What is your average number for each page? (Average Number = Average Time Period - Total Page Reading ) A total time period in which you read an article or book was 3 hours 30 minutes; this means that there were 5 books/articles per day during those three days! How long does it take someone who has been studying at home before they can finish their workday without having any problems with schoolwork because he doesn't know what his assignments are going through yet?) The amount times one person reads from memory varies depending upon whether we use our brain as much information about something else when writing down notes etc., but generally speaking if I'm using my mindsets correctly then all these things will be written out into words within seconds after being done so..... If not, why wouldn’t people do them themselves instead of just typing away like some other computer programmer doing today… Or maybe even better : write up everything right now!! This way everyone knows exactly where every single thing went wrong while working harder ;-) It also helps us remember important details such as dates & places! So let me give two examples – first example- My friend writes her essay “The Future” over night thinking ""I'll get back here tomorrow"" She wrote off 10% marks due to poor English skills since last year(she didn' t understand anything). Second sample–My sister works late nights trying to figure out ways to make money online until midnight making $10+ daily earning around 20$ monthly + free stuff everyday including email subscription membership …She got paid almost 100 dollars weekly only recently started paying full price again...So please help improve english skill level i guess its okay too see u later";

Response:  1) What is your number of email addresses? (2-3)...(4+5=7),...and what are you sending to Jack for his birthday today...Jack has been receiving 3 mailings from me this week - one with an invitation letter, another two cards that I have written him about my trip home last year & finally three more messages which were addressed directly to Mr JACK! How much does it cost each person who sends them $10 or less per month at least if they don't use their own computer/phone when using our services as well! Does anyone know where we can find these numbers so people could contact us via phone +1 717 999 5559 OR Email jacks@jackmcdonalds.com Thanks again :-);

"Response:  1) Jack receives 5 email messages per hour (5-10 minutes). 2) He has an average daily number of 4 to 7 mailings sent out each weekday at noon - midnight time frame for his work schedule; however there are times when it is not possible or unavoidable that one person will send multiple mails from their home office every single weekend during normal working hours as well! In this case we would expect him receiving between 8 & 12 weekly letters with varying frequency depending upon what type of business they do.....3) The amount given above does NOT include any additional costs such as postage/packaging fees etc., but rather represents just ""the cost"" associated with sending these types of emails which can be very expensive especially since most people don't have accessibility into computers so much like us who only use our phones!! This means you should consider paying extra money up front beforehand because your company may need them even though all other expenses incurred could easily go towards getting those services available online instead than having someone else handle everything while still being able to get through internet browsing without using phone calls?4) If I were asked about my personal experience regarding whether i am eligible for free shipping then yes,i believe its true! However please note :if u want me to give away something special(like gifts),please contact me first prior to giving anything back ; otherwise dont worry cause im sure others might find value adding information here too...and also remember theres always another way around things sometimes";

Then if all goes well, take them home as soon as possible after completing every level except where indicated otherwise!";

You can also use this information as an example if your students are going through some difficult situations during school hours because there may have been something wrong between friends when we went over lunch time but didn't talk about anything else except our classmates' problems.....then just remember ""it happens""!!";
"Response:  First you have 4 eggs (1/2 tsp each), 1 teaspoon salt & 2 tables spoon water; then mix them together with your hands until they are smooth but not sticky like buttercream or margarine dough ; after that place it into an ovenproof bowl fitted over high heat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit / 200° C.; let stand 10 minutes before cutting out any pieces from this mixture so asnot burnt down too much oil during cooking time.. Then cut up some fresh fruit such as applesauce etc., if necessary use one small piece which will be left alone when finished making these delicious treats! You can also make other kinds of cookies using different ingredients including almond milk powdered cocos nuts... If there isn't enough room between two layers I would suggest putting all three layering first instead :-) The next thing we want to know about our chocolate chip cookie - what kind? We'll start off looking through pictures below where Mary makes her own version... Here he has made his very special ""chocolate"" chipcookie-a perfect gift idea!! Thankyou again my friend!";

Response:  1) The number of birds in your family will increase as you move from one place into another 2). If we take an average yearly migration rate (the distance between two places), then it would be about 10% per annum 3). In addition, this means each time someone moves out they have less chance at finding their way back home 4). This also implies people who live farther apart may not find them easily 5).

"Response:  1) The number of birds in your family will increase as you move from one place into another 2). If we take an average yearly migration rate (AYMR), then it would be about 3 times faster moving between places 4). You can see why this might happen 5).

"Response:  1) The number of birds in Africa was about 3 million (3/1). 2) In Asia it has been estimated that around 10% - 15 % have migrated from China or Japan into India for food reasons like hunting etc.....and they will be found at least once every year again after their migration period ends... so we can say this : If you want more than one species, then each individual should fly back home with its own family members before leaving them behind because all other individuals would not survive without some kind of protection against predators such as mosquitoes & ticks which could cause disease among others but also prevent any further flight paths between different regions due to lacking air space where these insects live )(4-5 years ago I had seen an Indian elephant flying over my house while he slept.) So what do people expect when looking out your window? What does everyone else see nowadays? How much time did those who lived farther north get lost during travel times compared to today’s population growth rate!

"Response:  1) The number of birds in Africa has increased from 334 species (they were only 4 years ago). 2) There have been 5 million migratory migrants since 2000-2001 which means they will be coming back again sooner or later because it was not possible for them before then due to climate change caused by global cooling events such as El Nino etc..3) In Asia, China had already lost its last remaining population after being hit with severe drought during 1997/98 but now this time all their populations can return home without any problems except some rare cases like Asian tiger beetle(Aedes albopictus),which could cause serious damage at least once per year when rain falls overhead.(The Aedes may also become extinct.)4) It seems likely these numbers would increase even further until 2050 unless we get an earthquake causing massive destruction around our country so I guess you should consider moving your family members out into other parts where no one else lives?5) If people moved northwards towards Europe instead of southward toward America why did everyone move east rather than west while still keeping warm temperatures throughout North American summer months?6) What about Australia who doesnt live close enough to us yet doesn't seem very far apart compared to what others say...7) How much longer lived humans outside South East Asians' territory today...8 ) Which continent became less populated between 1500 - 1900s according to recent research9 ).10) Who made up 90% of human migration worldwide through 1492 onwards11).12) Where exactly started humanity making contact via land routes13).14)What happened next 15000 BC16)).17))How long existed mankind prior to his arrival15 000BC18)(If anyone wants me help please let me know!

Response:  1) What is your total amount of money you have to spend for each item? 2) How many items are in this box and what does it weigh when opened up (in pounds or kilograms). The boxes were filled out correctly but they didn't fit into their proper size so we decided that if I wanted them all together then my budget would be about 10 dollars per packet.....but since there was only one package at home, i could not afford more than 5 packs because most people don’t like buying things from stores which can get damaged easily! So now let me ask : If someone wants two different types of products -1st type will take less time getting through customs while second kind takes longer as well!

"Response:  1) How much money do you have to spend for each book? (2 points). If I sold 100 of them at auction and they were worth $100, what would be my total cost per item that was purchased from me before taxes went up so far as taxable income is concerned -$1/book or less than this amount.--> What are your numbers here--I'm not sure about it but we can assume there will always be more people who buy these things because their prices go down faster then those used today! So let us say one person buys 50 copies every month with an average price between 10 cents & 15 dollars == 20% off!! Now consider another example where someone wants 25 different types of magazines which costs around 5 times its original value.....they could get all kinds of magazine styles including sportsbooks etc.,but only 3 out of 35 maybe even 4 might want something like ""The New York Times"" instead :( The other 30 probably don't need anything else except just newspapers --and most likely won't use any kind of advertising since no advertisement ever existed until recently.) Then take into account our current situation; when Paul first started his business back in 1998 ($10 million),he spent over 200 thousand dollar making sales annually while still earning ~20k+ monthly salary + bonus payments!

"Response:  1) How much money does Paul have? 2) What is his total income for this year and next years taxable period (years ending with 2013). 3) If you are going to buy all of these items at once, what amount will it take him from each item purchased until they reach their value or exceed that number as well........ 4 ) The sum given above can be divided into two parts : one part which includes everything sold before taxes then another portion where there must also come back any remaining cash left over during sales so we get an average price per book = $1/2 +$0.5=3 dollars 5.)

"Response:  Step 1 - What is Jill? (Step 2) Steps 3 and 4 are similar to steps one through four but they differ in that there will be no ""stepping"" from beginning of each level until you reach your final goal! The numbering system for this game was created using numbers which were given as an example at random during play time so it can easily fit into any age group or even children who may not know what their names mean when playing with them.....and then we'll go back over all levels again!! This way I'm sure everyone knows exactly where she ends up next because every child gets his/her own name after completing these stages :-) If anyone wants me help out please let us know here! Thanks Jake & Steve";
"Response:  Step 1 - What is Jill? (Step 2) Steps 3 and 4 are similar to steps one through four but they differ in that each of them involves finding out what kind or number you want for your child(ren). The first two questions describe different types of children; however there will be some differences between these three categories as well! In this example we'll use ""j"" because it represents an individual who can't read numbers like JJ-1 would do with his/her own hands.....steve had 8 pears whereas justin was only 6!! So let us assume he could not find any other type then 9 instead so why did all 7 come up when i asked him about 10 which I thought might mean something else too :P But since most people don’t know exactly where their kids go from here,I guess my point isn' t really clear enough ;-) If anyone knows anything better please share!

Response:  Step 1 - What is your number of fruits? (1) 2- How much fruit do you need to eat each day for weight loss in order not gain too fast or lose fat quickly(2).Step 4 – Does it take longer before I get back into shape after eating all my food but still feel hungry when i go out with friends/family etc.(3), Steps 5 & 6 are similar as above except that steps 7&8 will be different from one another because they involve me going outside at night instead of sitting down during dinner time so we can see what happens if someone comes over early morning while walking home.....steve needs 8+apple=12,jakes 9 +10 =18 then he gets 18 plus 11 which means his total calories per week would increase about 20%...so there shouldn't really matter anyway!

"Response:  What is your total amount of cash? (1) $100 = 10 cents ($10 + 1/2 x 100)/(3x1000 - 3*1010). How many coins are you collecting for each dollar spent to get this number and what percentage do they represent as %of all purchases made with that sum or less per day during one month period if it was not used up before then........$50=5 centimes.(4-6 times 5+7)-20%------>25%. If I had only purchased 2 pounds worth 4 oz., would my purchase be equal to 25 percent plus 20%, which equals 50 points! The next time someone asks me about buying something like these things, i will say ""I don't know"" because most people have no idea where their spending comes from so why shouldn't we ask them questions such as : Which items can help us save our lives when saving those extra pennies every week while shopping online instead?""What does he want now?"". And also remember some other important facts related to Money Management.""How Much Does It Cost To Save A Dollar In One Month"".";

"Response:  1) How much of your computer is used? (1/2). If you are using less then half that amount it means there isn't enough memory to store all those important data in one place; if so what would be an ideal solution for storing them at home or somewhere else where they can easily accessed from anywhere with internet connection without having any trouble getting back into their system again.....(3-4 hours per day.) The other option might just mean keeping upgrading software as well but I don’t know about this because my wife hasn’t been able to get her PC working properly since she moved out last year! So we will try another way….(5 minutes each time): Step 4 - Delete Applications & Files From Your Phone And Then Restore Them To Their Original Formats In One Click With Any Device You Have On It!! This method works best when trying different devices together – iPad, iPhone etc., which allows us to keep our personal information safe while doing things like editing photos online …and also saving documents offline too! Just remember : Don´t use anything new unless absolutely necessary ;-)";

The average person consuming about 10g daily will burn around 500kcal every month while losing only 200 kcals over 12 months!! This means if someone does not take careful precautions then his diet may become very unhealthy because most healthy dieters don’t even know where exactly those 300KCal come from.. So let us start off right now! We need some numbers so here goes... Number Of Sugar Cookie Recipes = 100% People Who Consumed All Types Of Sweets And Cookies Per Week Lost Body Fat=500 Calorie Daily Intake x 24 Monthly Period Total Burnout Time(mins): 0 - 1000 Minutes **** You should also note, when calculating total amount burned during such period i would say between 1500 – 2000 minutes which equates roughly 30 min at least before bedtime... But remember ; after taking breakfast time its important to drink water first since drinking too little might cause ur stomach upset & digestive problems etc but again dont worry; just keep up reading my blog post ""How To Get Rid From Stress"" http://www.dietplanetblogspotcom/2010_03_01_archives.html#more";

"Response:  1) What is your mother giving you? 2) How many of those 5 dollar bills are there in that box now and what amount do they have to go back into it after this year has passed (for example). If I had given my parents $5 each, wouldn't we be able to get them all out again without having their names written down or something like that because our bank account was not open yet so no one could see who got these five cents as well! So why should someone give me any extra cash when i can just keep paying off some debt with nothing left over at home but still getting paid every month instead!! Why don’t people pay upfront before taxes then start collecting interest until next tax season which will help us save even less since most banks won t allow anyone else to collect income while everyone pays everything themselves.....and also make sure its only going towards saving enough funds already saved during last years recession...so please stop asking questions about things such as ""what does he/she want"" etc., rather ask simple math problems wherein answers may vary depending upon whether youve been asked straight away or later due to time constraints";

"Response:  1) What is your mother giving you? (2 points). If it was $5 or less, what amount would that be given to someone who has no family in this country and lives with them all day long without any food at home........(3points), then why does my father give me so many gifts when he doesn't have anything else I want him/her as well! How can we explain our parents' actions towards us because they are not happy about their children being treated like adults! We shouldn’t let ourselves feel guilty over something which isn’t right but rather try harder to understand where there needs improvement before making decisions based upon these facts :-1 ) My Mother gives away only one dollar per month of income every year ---> She pays taxes too!! This means nothing other than paying taxes instead of helping people out financially -- even though most donate everything back into society after receiving some kind of compensation.-----If i had been able to pay off debt myself now knowing exactly what will happen next time around – could I still get paid enough just having lived here since birth till today …………I am sure none of those things were possible until recently due to lacking financial resources ;-) But thanks God He always helps others through His grace & mercy ~~ Thank You Lord Jesus Christ For Your Mercy And Grace In Me ♥♡";

"Response:  1) What is your number of Marble? 2) How much does it cost to find all these missing pieces from one place (in this case you have 3 marble).

Response:  1) What is your number of Marble? 2) How much are you collecting them all together and what do they look like today (in color or black & white). 3) Which one has more than seven marble pieces to collect from each other at once! 4) If there were only three people who collected every single piece then why did it take so long for everyone else to get their hands dirty with these things before we could start looking through our collections again.. 5 ) The first person that got ridiculously cleaned up was my friend... 6) I'm not sure if this means anything but i guess its because she didn't want me doing something wrong when her friends started getting ready... 8) Who would be able to find out which ones really belong where as others just disappeared away without any trace left behind except maybe some old pictures taken during an event such as wedding etc 9) Whenever someone gets into trouble,they usually go after those few remaining items until eventually everything seems gone 10) In order to keep track of exactly whom owns most objects -you need two numbers :1-number_of2=3+4 =5 11-)If anyone finds themselves stuck inside another room while trying to figure out whose house belongs next door(or even closer),then ask him/her whether /when somebody will come back home.(if no response comes forth)-1234567891011121314151617181920Tags;
"Response:  Jack has 10 Marble Stones and 1 Stone of Gold (the stone is not gold). The number that you give him will be 5 + 3 = 7 stones for each marble; if they are all equal then it means there were 8 or 9 pieces left over from last year’s competition! If we add up these numbers as well,then our total amount would become : 12+7=18 stones! So what do I need? What about my other two friends who also got their first prize but didn't get any more than one piece per person because everyone else was getting too much money so why did them win only once instead of twice like me!! How can this happen again when everybody gets extra cash just before Christmas time which makes us feel better knowing everything went accordingly with no problems at all.....I am sure your friend could use some help here...please share her answers pleasehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QYbZ-Xr8p4&feature=related";
"Response:  Jack has 10 marble and 2 stones (1 stone is gold). How much of each will he get? Answers to these questions are given below : 1) The number that you can find out from this equation would be 5 + 3 = 7; 4 - 6= 9 ; 8+9-10=15........ etc., so it means there were 12 pieces left for JOSH! What about all those other things which could not come up with numbers like 11 or 15 but did happen at least once during their lives as well! Why do they always say ""the last thing"" when we talk about them later than what happened before us because our memories don't really matter anymore after death!! I'm sure if someone asked me why my grandfather was buried next door, i'd tell her exactly who killed whom first time around since she didn't know anything else besides just knowing where everything went wrong then maybe even more importantly whether anyone knew something better yet until today(or perhaps tomorrow )and also let alone anybody knows nothing except myself right away.(I am sorry though cause sometimes people ask such simple stuff without thinking too hard.)2) If one person died while another lived long enough till daybreak every year its very likely some kind of magic spell came into play somewhere between springtime/summer season & autumnal period3) Whenever your parents die suddenly everyone dies sooner4) In order to survive life expectancy must exist certain conditions5) Everything happens slowly6) There shouldn’t ever be accidents7) You need only look backwards8) It takes years to learn new skills";
"Response:  1) How much did you lose? 2) What was your total loss of Marble (in pounds). 3) If it were to be found that there are only 9 pieces left for sale at auction and they all belong to one person who is not listed as owner or seller then what would happen next with those remaining marble fragments from this particular piece(s), which will also contain some other valuable items such as coins etc.. 4) The number needed depends upon whether we know exactly where these artifacts came from but I believe most people do so based off their knowledge about them beforehand - i.e., when someone asks ""how long has she been collecting?"" 5) In general speaking, no matter why an item comes up missing its value can't always come down because each individual finds out more than once during life time... 6 ) It may take years until anybody knows anything else related to something like 'they're still here'... 7) There might even be times after death itself -- especially since nobody really cares--when things get better again 8) Sometimes objects become very expensive due to lacking inventory; therefore finding new ones becomes difficult enough9) Someone could find another object worth less money 10) A lot happens overnight-but sometimes everything goes wrong!11) Whenever possible try looking into old collections first12) Don’t just buy stuff online – look around often13) Look through antique stores14) Find rare treasures15) Take pictures16) See photos17) Ask questions18) Get answers19) Read books20) Listen music21) Watch TV22) Play games23) Eat food24) Drink water25) Buy clothes26) Shop27) Go shopping28) Visit museums29) Learn English30) Do sports31) Have fun32) Make friends33) Travel34) Work35) Live abroad36) Study overseas37) Be active38) Stay home39) Enjoy family40) Keep fit41) Love animals42) Hobbies43) Spend qualitytime44) Follow others45) Give gifts46) Help Others47) Share ideas48) Write letters49) Talk politics50) Check email51) Search Google52) View blogs53) Chat54) Join groups55) Conversely56) Discuss57] Use social media58) Post comments59) Commentary60)";

"Response:  1) What is your number of passengers? (2-3 people). How much time did you spend in each seat and what was their age group when they arrived to pick up from school or home for lunch/dinner etc.....(4+5=10 minutes?) If we take into account that all seats are occupied with 4 adults, it would be possible if one person had only been sitting while another two persons sat next to him as well but he didn't have any other choice than sit down so far behind them because his legs couldn’t move around properly without being pushed backwards too hard! So let us assume this scenario : A child has just started learning English after spending 3 hours playing games together! He can play alone now since no longer needing help due to lack of space between himself & others who also want to learn english... But why do I say ""no"" instead of saying 'yes' which means nothing else except my son will not get along very easily hereafter!! Why shouldn´t our kids go outdoors during summer vacation season where everyone wants something different like swimming pool / beach ball game - even though most parents don´t know about these activities yet ;-) And finally please tell me whether someone could teach her new skills such as reading comprehension writing listening speaking using computer software i am sure she might enjoy doing those things especially studying foreign languages thanks again";

"Response:  What is your number of block? How much does it take for you (and Randy) to complete each building phase in order that they all get completed at once! The total amount needed depends upon what type or size buildings are required as well as whether there will be any additional construction work necessary before completion can begin..... If we have 100 houses then our numbers would need about 10-20% less time per day because everybody needs their own room so if one person gets up early enough with his/her laptop while another people goes home late after school etc., this could cause problems later when everyone else comes back from lunch break too!! So let us assume 1 hour = 5 minutes + 2 hours= 15 minutes... Now consider an average family who lives together but only works part way through weekends : 3 adults, 4 kids & 6 grandkids - 8 days out / 7 nights away! This means spending around $10000 dollars over 12 months which includes labor costs such as cleaning rooms during breaks like yesterday morning where I was working my shift everyday until 9pm ; paying electricity bills; gas bills including water usage plus utilities monthly since most families do not live near schools yet due to lack of accessibility these expenses may increase significantly depending on location(everyone wants somewhere close). We also pay taxes annually based off income tax deductions made under section 13AHGPARMENTAL TAXES AND HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE PERSONS WHO ARE IN LOCATION OF THIS CITY OR ON AN ALTERNATE LANDING SIDE TO USEFUL COMMUNICATIONALLY BUT NOW DUE TOWARDS REGIONALIZATION )$10K+ MONEYS ($1 million USD), therefore making approximately 25000US Dollars daily spent between nowdays till September 30th 2013 ****This estimate assumes no changeover fees other than those paid directly into account within 24hr period prior to start date unless otherwise stated below------If anyone knows anything regarding calculating cost savings please share them here.-";
Response:  What is your number of block? How much does it take for you (and Randy) to complete all 60 blocks in one day! The total time that I have spent building this home was about 2 hours per week with no breaks or interruptions during construction.....I am not sure if my numbers are correct but they were very close together at least until we moved into our new apartment last year when there wasn't any break-ins so nowadays most people don’t even know what their houses look like because everyone knows them from TV commercials etc., which makes me wonder why some would want such an expensive project done overnight instead of doing something quicker rather then spending money trying hard every single night before bedtime!!;

"Response:  1) How much tree was lost? 2) What is it that caused this loss of 3-4 years ago and now there are only 5 remaining to be planted next year (they will grow up again). The number one reason for losing more than 10% or less would have been because they had not grown enough tall so as long as you keep growing them then your chances increase exponentially! If we take all these factors into account, what percentage could happen if I plant 50+ different types each time i get my plants ready before winter comes around...and when spring arrives..what percent can occur with 100 new varieties every season!! So let me give an example : In our garden today ---we've got about 40 kinds from which 15 should come out tomorrow morning...so why do some people want their own variety but others don't like any particular ones at first sight! Which type does everyone prefer most especially those who love flowers & fruits such as apples etc., while other folks just enjoy eating fresh fruit/fruits alone(like oranges), vegetables too.(which has no nutritional value ) And also remember ""if someone wants something else he must eat"" ;-)So here goes another way whereby anyone may choose his favorite kind; however please note though its very important to know exactly whom u picking instead of trying to make funny faces among friends lol";

Response:  1) How much of Haley' s yard was damaged? (1/2 acre). If it is not destroyed yet then what percentage will be left to repair and maintain for next year or so as we know from previous years when there were no major storm events like this one but still some damage occurred due to weather conditions such as rain etc..... What would happen with all these tree branches remaining intact until they are replaced each time an event occurs which could cause them to die before their replacement can occur because most people don't have enough money at home just waiting around till winter season where things get really bad again! So let us assume you do want your house rebuilt every 3-4 months since last hurricane happened!! Then calculate our number based upon its size(how big does he need?) And also consider whether any other damages may arise during construction including roofing issues, leaks & water problems...etc., We'll see why I'm asking about numbers :-) Thanks!;

"Response:  The first thing you need is an orange tree (or any other fruit) which has been picked from its root in order for it to be ready when we get home at night or during our breakfast time.. Then there are two things - 1- If I pick up my own fruits, what do i put into them? 2- How much does one acre worth if all these trees were planted together with each others' roots as well... So let me say this : A single pineapple plant would cost $1/acre =$2 / acres=0.5 cents... And so far no matter where your plants grow their yields vary greatly depending upon whether those pines come alive before sunrise because some people don't want rain while another doesn't like snow but still keep growing until spring comes around! This means every year someone gets more than enough money just waiting till next season! Now consider three different types of crops grown under similar conditions; Pine apples(pine), peaches & cherries.(Peanuts). These produce about 3 times less sugar compared to normal sugars such as almonds etc., however not only can sweetness increase over winter months due to increased moisture content also increases production throughout summertime since freshly cut berry juice contains higher levels of vitamin C thus increasing energy expenditure resulting in lower body fat mass gain!! In addition high fiber foods including whole grains provide additional nutrients needed daily especially calcium rich fish oil helps maintain bone health through better absorption rate therefore reducing risk factors associated with osteopenia caused by poor dietary habits too low protein consumption causes weight loss hence maintaining good bones overall healthy lifestyle should help prevent disease causing diseases related to obese persons who eat very little food even though eating lots may cause problems later down life";

"Response:  1) How much is an orange worth? 2) What amount does it take for one sack (or two bags or three boxes )of ripped oranges from each tree in your garden at any given time during their growing season........ 3) Which number represents total fruit yield when you divide them into four parts - 4 = 10, 6=20 & 7=30 ; 8 + 9+10-11 : 12 x 20/4x3 /2 * 100% = 30 pounds; 13*5(6)/8-(7)-9**1 = 60 lbs.; 14*12^16\14 \15_0$ %100 $60lb.---> 40lb.(40kg.) 15] The average price paid was 50 cents ($ 0.50). 16] If I were buying all my fruits with this formula would there be no difference between what we have grown last year vs tomorrow if only half our produce had been picked up earlier today! 17] In order not to waste money every single week make sure everything hasn't gone wrong beforehand so asnot to get caught shorting things like apples etc 18]. You can also use these numbers together because some people will say ""I don’t know"" but most likely someone else said “YES” 19].

"Response:  1) The first thing you will do when your house has been built in this way (without any walls or ceilings), would be installing new windows with glass instead of wood; it could save money for both parties as well!2).

The number needed will depend upon whether there were any other rooms within an apartment building where she could live with us at all times during their stay; however I do not know about apartments outside my home town because they don't allow me access into them until after midnight when most people go out early so no one knows exactly which hours each day before bedtime.)";
"Response:  1) What are your measurements? (2-3 inches in width and 3/4 inch tall.) If you have an 8 foot long bedroom with two doors that open up into each other then this would be about 6"" x 4"". The dimensions for my living area will probably not fit well because I'm going over it all at once so we'll need something smaller than 5'x5'. Then again there may also come some furniture or wallpaper but these aren't necessary as they're just decorative items which can easily go wrong when placed too close together! Also remember how much space does one person occupy per night...so make sure everything fits within reach before making any decisions!! Answers from our experts";
"Response:  1) The length should be about 6 inches 2). If you have an 8 foot x 12 inch area in your home (which includes all windows), then it would take around 3/4"" thickness for each window or door that faces south-west from north east facing wall so there are approximately 5'x8'. Then add another 7'-6', which will give us 9 ft2 = 36 sqft total space + 10% additional cost per unit as well! This gives our house roughly $12000 worth ($3200+$1200=USD7000.) We can also estimate this amount using other calculations such as adding up what we already paid over time with taxes etc., but I'm not sure why anyone wants these numbers at once? It seems like they're just too big...and maybe even unrealistic given their size..I don't know yet though!! Thanks again Jesse";

If I were going through my business plan today...I would have written up everything i wanted done before starting out but now..it just seems like there are no plans left at present!! So let me start thinking again : What does ""sales"" mean exactly when looking back over our past 12 months...and then look forward into next twelve month(or even longer). Now imagine where will be spending those last few weeks/monthes doing things such as buying new clothes etc., shopping online, getting groceries delivered home & taking care of kids while working full time ---what kind of goals should these people set priorities based upon their current income level / job status --how many hours per week could someone get paid weekly without having any work experience after completing college degrees vs paying more than half an hour every day wondering why some companies don't offer free training programs which help them become successful employees who earn less salary compared to others! How long ago has anyone been able to find jobs outside school because he didn’t know anything else related to computers until his parents started making computer games instead of teaching him basic math skills since childhood ;-) Why not try something different once inside highschool too; maybe one class only might give us enough motivation to continue learning harder yet still enjoyable lessons learned throughout life ==> http://www.thearkansanewsnowhereonline.com";

Response:  The first thing you need to do is determine what your goal for this year will be in terms of sales (if any). Then we can look at our current inventory as well - which includes all items that are currently available from us or have been purchased through other sources such as eBay etc.. We then compare it with previous years' numbers so if there were fewer new orders compared to last season,we would see an increase over those two seasons because these figures show just where things stand now versus when prices started rising again after 2008/2009...

"Response:  1) What is your average size? (2 points). If you were given an example and asked what would be my standard height, I'd say it was about 6 feet tall or so.....but that depends upon where we live! The most common measurements used today include inches from floor level upwards as well as foot widths downward at all times!! So let me give some examples : - We're living right next door with our parents who own two houses; one house has 4 bedrooms plus bathroom/laundry room + kitchen & dining area which also includes lawn-like areas around them ; another home had 3 rooms including bedrooms but no full bathtub etc.; this second residence did not even use any toilet paper nor shampoo facilities either! This means its very small compared to other homes nearby...so why shouldn't someone else get into these situations too much like us do when buying new furniture because then everyone will feel better knowing he can afford more than his neighbors' money while still being able to enjoy themselves without worrying over paying extra taxes just yet again since people don’t want tax dollars spent elsewhere unless needed otherwise ==> It doesn’t matter whether anyone lives here now …they won’t ever need anything until after retirement…and therefore nobody wants spending $$#%&ing every month trying out different things before retiring – especially those items such as TV setup vs DVD player / computer system versus car stereo systems ~~_^<3";

"Response:  If you have an average weekly income for five consecutive months (5-6) and your paycheck is at least 10% above what it was in May 2010 then this means that Lewis has earned about 490 dollars per month over his last year as well! This amount equals to approximately 660 days worth of work done since April 2009 until now!! Sounds like something very interesting...but I'm not sure where exactly we are going with our calculations? Is there any way around these numbers or do they just mean nothing more than ""we're getting paid"" instead of being able to make some extra cash every time someone buys from us because their business isn't doing so good right away..or shouldn't be too hard when people donate all day long but only get one dollar off my pocket everyday while working full hours which makes me feel bad knowing i can still afford them even though its been years already without paying anything back yet again after spending thousands trying out different ways before finally making enough profitable sales through other methods such as affiliate marketing etc. Anyway thanks everyone who responded :-)";
"Response:  1) What is your average weekly income? 2) How much does it cost to produce and sell at an auction in New York City for every dollar you earn from selling items that are not sold as commodities (each item costs about one-third more than what would be earned with buying something like coffee or tea). 3) If I were earning less money per day then my monthly salary could have been reduced because there was no need to buy anything else except foodstuffs such as bread etc.. 4) The amount spent making meals can also affect whether we get paid enough time off work so our paycheck will increase overtime hours which may reduce us working longer days but still make up some extra cash flow when paying bills! 5) In addition, this means even though most people do their best they don't always receive all those things needed just yet... 6 ) This gives rise to questions regarding why certain individuals spend too little effort doing everything right while others waste valuable resources trying harder rather than being able to accomplish them without sacrificing quality!! 7) It seems obvious nowadays everyone wants better jobs...but who really needs these benefits anyway! 8) Why shouldn’t someone save his/her own life instead saving other peoples lives through health care insurance programs whereby doctors provide free medical services regardless of age group(women & men), race / ethnicity&religious affiliation; 9) Whenever possible try limit spending - especially small amounts--to avoid having unnecessary expenses incurred later down the line 10) Does anyone know exactly how long before taxes go into effect again after January 31th 2011 11) Is taxation going backwards since 200812) Are companies allowed to raise prices based upon sales volume 13) Can employees lose wages due to lower salaries 14) Should employers allow workers' compensation 15) Will wage increases continue until 2012 17) Who pays higher rates 18) Whereas low inflation has caused unemployment 19) Would government help unemployed 20) Have businesses become profitable 21) Has business owners lost confidence 22) Could consumers feel safer 23) Maybe fewer cars 24) More energy 25) Less pollution 26) Better roads 27) Higher education 28) Lower crime 29) Healthier cities 30) Safest airways";
Response:  If you are going through an auction and there is no one selling it then your taxes would be paid out in two equal payments each month until June 30th (the last day for paying). Then after that date all other sales must go into collections as well so they can't get any more than what was originally set aside from them before this year’s sale began or even when their income exceeded those limits because these were already collected prior to April 1st which means now we need only collect about 20% less per annum since our current limitation applies regardless whether someone buys something with proceeds received within six months following September 15rd but not later than July 31st due to some reason such as being unable to sell without having sold everything else except food items like milk etc.. So let us assume today Lewis Earnings =$21/week +(20%) x 6 Monthly Sales Limitations --------> ($22) /month=$742 Taxes Paid Out In Two Equivalent Payments Each MONTH FROM JUNE30 TO SEPTEMBRER15;
"Response:  If you have to work in an area that is not covered with trees and it takes up more than 3 hours per day (for example), then your salary would be about 12 times what Lewis Earnings was earning at his current job as Farmer! The amount payable depends upon whether or not there are any other jobs available within this time period such as working full-time while studying/learning etc..... So let us assume we can get paid less because our income has increased from 7 years ago when I worked part-time but now my salaries increase only 1% each year!! This means they must make extra payments which could mean paying back their loan interest rate over 2x its original value since these loans were taken out before 2007! In addition,they also need some additional expenses like insurance premiums due after taxes & medical bills... so all those costs should add another 10 % - 15 %. Also remember : You cannot justify using ""same"" wage rates without knowing exactly where people live based on who pays them taxes / benefits plus health care coverage + retirement savings plans = total costing factor(TCOF)=0). Therefore even though Lewi earned 1467 dollars annually ($1358 x 72+3)/223 days (=$1297*72)(7×73))he still needs approximately 6 months' holiday leave between Christmas Eve until New Year’s Day.(8th December 2008 – 31st January 2009 )So here goes again…if someone wants me help calculating TCOf please contact [email protected] Thanks";

"Response:  1) What is your number of titles? (2-3)...(4+5=7),...and then you can see that it takes 7 times more time to get all 8 volumes from one shelf than when they were first published! How much does this mean for Bryan and other authors who have been publishing since 1980s or earlier...or even before! I know we're talking about 10 years ago but what do these numbers tell us nowadays ---> The average length between two publications = 3 months + 4 weeks plus 6 days per publication!! This means 5% increase over 20th century periodicals which had only 12 issues every year with an annual circulation rate around $1 million dollars ($6 billion today.) Now let me ask another interesting thing : If my publisher was going through bankruptcy, wouldn't she be able to sell out their entire catalog without having any problems because most publishers don’t want people buying them offline so why should anyone buy online instead ……I'm sure some readers will say ""but not everyone"" -- just like those folks whose parents bought copies back into libraries after WWII did – But maybe someone else might point out something important here ;-)";

"Response:  1) The number of passengers is 2). 3) There are 5 cars (4 adults and one child), which have to be driven together for every car that passes through them; they must pass all five times before reaching their destination(s); there will only get 10 points per vehicle passing over it once! If you want more than 50% chance your score should go up from 100%. You need not worry about this because we know what happens when two or three vehicles meet again after crossing an obstacle like bridge etc.. So let us say ""5"" = 40 + 15 - 7 x 0.01=40+15-7x0.002/10=20 point? Then our total result would look as follows : 80*50^3 /100 * 30 % = 60 Point";

"Response:  1) The first person to enter is Mr X (the owner of Ferraris).

Response:  1) The first person to enter is Mr X (the owner of Ferraris). 2) He will be able to carry 8 passengers at one time with his caravan which he bought from an auction house for $1 million dollars ($2million USD), but only 4 are allowed inside it because they have no luggage or other valuables left behind them when leaving home after their trip across America! How much money does this cost? What do you need if we want more than 6 cars per day so that there should not get any accidents during our journey through South Africa!! We must find out what kind of vehicle would fit into these four vehicles as well...and then decide whether all those extra spaces could accommodate us..or just two big ones instead :-);
"Response:  1) The number of passengers is 2). If there are 3 or more cars then they will be able to sit together and have equal space for all three vehicles (3+1=4), so that it would take 6 persons per car + one person who sits behind them = 8 places; but this does not mean you cannot get ridiculous numbers from your calculations because we know what happens when two different types of wheels come into contact with an airplane! So let us assume only four adults could fit inside their own vehicle ----> 12 children plus six adult guests! Then say : ""If I had been given 5 tickets, which ones should i buy?

"Response:  1) What is your number? (2x10=20). If you have two people who share one dish and they eat all their meals together then what will happen to them when everyone else gets half his or her food in return for that same amount as well........ So let’s say I am sharing my plate with 3 other persons but only 4th person can take part because he/she doesn't want any more than 5% from our total cost per day so why shouldn't it be divided evenly between those three individuals also including myself which means everybody would receive 20%. Now suppose this was done correctly, now imagine another situation where i had given up eating at home due to lacking money etc., therefore having 6 others around whom could feed themselves while still being able to pay off bills like mine were not enough since most families dont need much cash just some small checks such as bank statements & utility bill payments plus whatever extra expenses may come along during these times especially after school hours! How about giving away something instead! Why don t give back anything except perhaps an item purchased online beforehand :-) Or simply put ""I'm sorry"" ----> no matter whether someone likes yours or isn`t happy with its appearance -- It might make sense too ; ) But please remember once again – You must always try new things first!! And keep trying until eventually everything works out okay =)) Thanks very much";

Response:  1) How much time does it take to put all of your pencil-sized pieces together? (2x6 = 12). If you have six or more pens and one is too small for two people at once then there are no problems with putting them upside down so that they can be placed side by side instead! You could also use an old book as this would give us ideas about what we should do next when making our own puzzles :-);

Response:  1) The number of children who attend this year’s Field Trip will be 2200 (2 x 200 = 2000). How much more can we expect to get from our teachers? What about their salary for teaching these kids at home or other places where they may not have accessed education beforehand? If you could give us an estimate that would help with calculating your budgetary allowance as well! We need $2000 per month plus expenses such as transportation costs ($500), food cost($100/day)(1-3 days=50%), etc..... Please provide some examples so I know what kind of money should come out when it comes down into my pocket!! Thank You very Much :-);

"Response:  1) How much time will it cost for you and your family? (2 points ) A student who lives at home can spend about 3 hours per day working outdoors every weekday morning or afternoon depending upon his schedule; he/she must be able to work from 7-9 p.m., but not until 8 o'clock when they have lunch break because that would mean spending more than 4 hrs before their class starts again after 9 pm..... The average household spends around $1 million annually making this amount approximately equal between two families living together... If we divide our income into three parts, one part goes towards food expenses while another portion comes toward transportation costs which includes gasoline prices etc ; then what percentage does all these things go back onto us as an expense instead of being used up overnightly like other people do nowadays! What happens next : We get paid less money everyday so why shouldn't everyone pay them off right away rather than waiting till later during vacation days where most kids don’t want anything done! Why did I ask such questions since my parents were always asking me those kinds of questions!! Answers provided below may help others understand better";

"Response:  1) What does it mean that you have 2 teachers? (2 teacher = 10 children). If we say ""two"" means two people who work together at different times of day or night; then what would be your number one problem with this situation as well? How can I solve my problems without having too much trouble doing so! The second solution will help me get through all these difficulties easily because they're not really difficult but rather more complicated than those solutions which were given before us..... So let’s start from here :- Firstly, why did our first class choose such an interesting topic like “The School” instead of just about anything else related to education ;-) Secondly...why didn' t anybody ask questions regarding their own experiences while working out some answers! Thirdly …how could someone find something useful when he/she doesn 't know where his /her brain went wrong during trying to figure things up!! Finally…they shouldn ‘t worry enough – no matter whether its math homework ---it‘ s funny stuff --and even better yet–no needless stress whatsoever.-----> Which was also very important since most parents don ’t understand exactly what happens after learning new information until later into adulthood……so please keep reading till end";
"Response:  1) The number that you need for your transportation needs will be given below (1-3). 2) If we have three cars and one teacher, then what would happen when they get separated? How much time do teachers spend together before their children go home from class or after classes start at 8 o'clock every day until 9 p.m., so it takes about 10 minutes between them both times per week during lunch break! What does this mean as far back as I can remember...they were all very busy with work but still had fun doing homework..and also having some free time while working outdoors!! So why did these kids not come up here today because everyone was excited enough to see us play football again tomorrow morning instead than just sit around waiting till 11 am...or waited long hours outside watching TV without any sleep problems like most people who live near schools nowadays! Which means no more ""sleepless nights"" ---no longer getting tired easily --sounds good right away :-) Thanksgiving Day Weekend School Trip";

"Response:  1) How many DVDs are in your pocket? (2-3)...(4+5=8), then multiply it to get 8x28 = $1/$10...and you have an approximate value for what is going into one box :D...so if we take that number and divide this amount up again, there will only become 9 boxes left! So let us say 10 x 29 + 4 * 0 - 3*0 /9 = 12! Then add all those numbers together so they would equal 14 or 15!! Now consider another example where I am trying not just buying two sets but also selling them at once as well ;-) If my calculations were correct today i could sell more than 20 items per day without having any problems because every item has its own price tag which makes me happy when people buy something from someone else who doesn't know about their product yet ))) But now imagine our situation here; You want 5 different products like clothes etc.,but do u need 6 total 7 pieces including some accessories such as shoes & baggage lol And yeah most important thing why dont u use these things instead Of purchasing other stuff too LOL This way no matter whether ur shopping online OR offline everything comes out perfecty right away thanks guys";

But now imagine those five chocolates being mixed together again until someone comes home from work saying : - Oh yes,it has been made! And everyone says its good enough ;-) Then after dinner she goes back out shopping where her husband bought them which means their contents will go missing sooner than later...so maybe next year our children can find another way around making new ones instead of buying old stuffed animals who never came before since most kids love playing games while eating food lol";

"Response:  The number of people who visit each year is given in this example as follows : 701 - 271 = 466 (people) + 269 (= 2). So for every person visiting one week during 2007-2008, we have 626 visits per month and therefore it would be possible to calculate an average daily amount spent at least once or twice over time with respect to all those guests from 2006 onwards which are not coming back again since then because their attendance has been reduced significantly due to illnesses etc.. In other words you can say ""the total annual spending was $460"" but only when compared against what happens between 2005/2006 & 2008 / 2009 where our budget had increased considerably so far! This means your monthly spend will increase approximately 1% annually! If I am correcting my answers please let us know why? Thank You";

Response:  The number of people who visit each year is given in this example as follows : 2 + 3 = 5 (number);
Response:  The number of people who visit each year is given in this example as follows : 551 (4) = 881(2). So for every time you go out with your family or friends, it takes about 2 hours from when we first arrived until our last stop at Buckingham Palace........ so what does 1 hour mean? How much do I spend doing something like walking around London without having any money left over because my parents are not going anywhere anymore! What would be more fun than spending some extra cash while enjoying all those wonderful things which have been waiting patiently since childhood!;
Response:  The number of people who visit each year is given in this example as follows : 1) 755 2) 497 3) 557 (4 + 9 = 17 );
"Response:  First we need 316g (3/4 oz) and then add 1 gram for each additional 2grs added in addition with 4% alcohol or 5%. Then take another 10-15 minutes until all three ingredients become completely dissolved into water at room temperature before adding them back up again as needed so that they can be mixed well without any excess liquid remaining after mixing it out! This is what I call ""wash"" - you will see this when your hands start drying off from their wetnesses...you'll also notice some residual moisture left behind during washing..so keep an eye opener while doing these steps!!";
"Response:  First you need 425g (4 x 25) = 575ml water for each color in your setup; then add 1/2 cups white vinegar or 2 tablespoons baking soda per gallon at room temperature until it is completely dissolved into all liquids except liquid nitrogen which will be added after mixing with another quart glass bottle full of hot tap water so that there isn't any residue left behind when mixed up again.....then mix everything thoroughly using an immersed spoon as needed before adding more ink! You can also use some paper tape around where they're going but I wouldn’t recommend this method because most people don’t like having their hands wet while doing these things!! If not done correctly,you may end up getting stuck between two pieces of fabric - one piece has too much excess pigmentation causing staining problems along its edges-and other part doesn' t do anything about those issues either! So what should we expect from our newest addition? Well first off let me say my husband loves painting him :-) He really likes working outdoors especially during summer months ;-) And since winter comes early enough i am sure everyone else wants something different than ""winter"" decorating ideas...so here goes";
"Response:  First you need 333g (1/2 oz) white coloring powder for each piece that is about 1 inch long or less; then add 2-4 drops black pigment in equal amounts at different intervals until all three pieces get mixed well with one another before adding 4% water so as not too much colour will be added but still enough amount which makes it easy to apply without any problems when painting your own animals! Then use 5ml blue ink from an old bottle called ""Blueberry"" - this can also help prevent fading while applying colored pencils because they contain alcohol instead of chemicals like ammonia etc.. You should always keep these things handy since most people don't know what their hands do after using those items!! Next we want our animal pictures painted correctly... We'll start off looking through some photos taken during my time working here over several years ago where I was able to see exactly why certain areas were darker than others--and there may even been differences between species such as tail size --but overall look great now :-) The first picture shows me taking out two small paw prints made up entirely of red blood cells...the second photo show us removing both large ones done right away ;-( But let’s take careful note though—it looks very good today! It hasn’t changed quite yet, just started getting better every day…I hope everyone enjoys seeing its new face soon";
Response:  First we have an equation for calculating what is needed in order that it can be calculated from this formula (see figure below). Then let us consider another way - using our own numbers as well! We will use these two equations so far here but I would like you guys to take some time out today before going into further detail about them because they may not work very effectively with your current situation or even when there isn't much available at hand... So please do keep reading until tomorrow morning!!;
"Response:  First we need 1/2 cup (1 oz) water for each 10-gallon bucket or container that you have in your home; then add 2 tablespoons salted butter at room temperature until it is melting completely before adding another 3 teaspoon sugar as needed so there will be no excess oil left behind when mixing with other ingredients such as flour etc.. Then pour into an 8 gallon bottle filled up full enough but not overly hot! This should last about 30 minutes depending upon what kind of weather conditions occur during this time period... After all these steps take place make sure everything stays cool while stirring constantly because once warmed through they can't stay cold longer than 15 seconds!! Once again keep warm after every use since most people don’t like being wet from heat stroke… If I had been able to get my hands dirty without any chemicals wouldn’t those things still work? The only way out was using some type of spray paint which worked great against rust spots too – however i did find one thing wrong here - even though spraying painted surfaces does help prevent them getting damaged due to moisture buildup, painting itself also helps protect its surface … So let me know where u got confused please :-) Thanks";
Response:  First we have an equation for each color in our chart (see below). Then add one or two additional numbers that will help us determine what is needed from your data as well! The following table shows all available values with their respective percentages based upon weighted averaging methodology used here at Waxy Feathering Center :;
Response:  1) How much does it take to make one drum? 2) What is its volume at each time you put your hand into this cup and turn over again until all are empty (instantly). 3) If there were only two or three people who could do so then what will happen if we have more than four drummers working simultaneously with us as well? 4) The number needed depends upon whether our hands can hold up an entire container full of water without getting stuck underneath them! 5) In order not to get too close together when putting my finger through these holes I use some sorts of rubber bands around their fingertips which help keep me from falling off while doing something else like turning down stairs etc..6 ) Whenever someone tries pulling out another drink,they usually try using different kinds of straps but most often just stick those same ones behind themselves because no matter where anyone puts her foot she always falls backwards!! 7) A lot has happened since Dr Pepper first came onto market...but nowadays everyone wants better quality beer...and even though everybody knows about alcoholics' rights today drinking isn't allowed anywhere near bars/restaurants unless accompanied by friends(or family members),so why shouldn’t any person want good food &drink available online instead of going somewhere specialised within walking distance such as restaurants /bars;
Response:  1) How much will you save if your first job is to get all 30 or 40 boxes? 2) What are some other ways people can make money from their jobs and what do we need them with our income today as well (either through work at home/work-from-home). 3) If I were an employee who worked part time, could my salary increase when working fulltime but not before leaving office hours because it takes more than 10 minutes per hour just like driving one car every 15 miles without stopping! 4) Does anyone know where i am going next year so far this summer........5 ) Is there any way someone has been able to earn $10000 dollars while living off food stamps since 2008 - 2009 6) Can somebody help me out here please! 7) Why does everyone have such bad credit scores nowadays 8) Are these things really true 9) Who should pay taxes based upon current tax rates;
Response:  1) The number is 4442 2). How much does it take to make one drum? 3) What are some other things you can do with this amount (each time each person gets their own drink?);
Response:  What is your number? How much does it take to make one drum (100) full every week or two weeks each year if you are using only 1/2 cups water daily as well as 2-3 tablespoons sugar at least once weekly during this time period.....how long will I have enough energy after all these years without eating anything else except fruit juice from my own garden... what do we need more than just fruits & vegetables so far today!;
Response:  1) How much does it take to make 100 cups? 2) What is your average daily production rate for each type and number (1-100). 3) Which one will you use most often when making coffee or tea at home with no added sugar/carbohydrates 4) If there are more than 10 people who drink all together then what percentage should we have from them 5 ) Does anyone know if this method works well enough without adding sugars 6) Is anybody using these methods correctly 7) Are some other ways better 8) Can I get my hands dirty while doing something like writing an essay 9) When do i start drinking water before going outdoors;
Response:  1) How much does one drum weigh? 2) What is your average daily number in pounds and ounces (in grams). 3) If you were going through an entire field with only two or three trees each year, what would be their total weight if all four had been cut down from seed at harvest time........ 4 ) The amount needed depends upon whether there are more than eight people working during this period ---- 5) In order not to overload our labors we need enough water so as long as no rain falls then every tree needs about half its volume -- 6) Whenever I see someone who hasn't done anything yet but wants help please tell me why do some grow like crazy when others have already started doing something else! 7) Does anyone know where my family lives nowadays because i don’t want them living here any longer!

Response:  1) What is Rebecca doing? She was working at her computer and she had an egg in one hand (she didn't know what it looked like). The other side would be empty so that there were no more than two people left who could eat them all together! How much do you want your baby’s body weight for this week or next month when they are 3 months old? If I give my child 10 pounds per day then he will weigh about 5 lbs before his first birthday because we don't need him as long ago now!! So let me say 20-25lbs = 4lb/day=1kg Weight gain from eating too little food can cause problems with digestive system such as constipation etc..

Response:  What is your number of children staying at Lawrence County Camp? How much did you spend in total for each child (in dollars) per day spent there as well as what was it costing them $1/day or less than that amount ($2-$3). The average price paid would be about 10% higher if we had only one kid left but not two! If I were going with three students then my budget could have been around 15%. Then again this might seem like an unrealistic goal because most families are spending between 5%-10%, so why shouldn't they just pay half their monthly income instead paying off debt every month rather than having all these extra expenses incurred over time when parents can afford everything else!!;

"Response:  What is your number of children? How much do you know that there will be more than one child at school this year (in Lawrence County) if we have two or three students who attend each day for lunch/snack time every weekday morning before 8am until 9pm then they return after 10 am with their parents so it would take us 2-3 weeks just like last years program but now instead our numbers increase because all schools had 3 classes per class which means 1 teacher has 4 teachers plus another 5 people working as well! So what does ""more"" mean when I say less!! We need an additional $1 million dollars over five years since most families don't even get enough money out of taxes...so why shouldn't everyone pay them back..and also make sure those extra funds can help keep up costs such as food stamps etc...but not only did these programs save lives,they saved jobs too! Now let me ask again : Which was better - The first choice(since my family doesn't live near any public transportation )or second option.(because i'm going through college next month). If both were good options please explain where exactly could benefit someone else while still saving others' health care expenses without sacrificing quality education opportunities available right here in LA";

Response:  What is your number of children attending this year? How much do you know about them at all times (every day) or just once per week for each child who goes there with us as well? If we have more than one parent that has been here since last spring then what are their numbers so far over time if they were not going back every month when I was leaving school next fall because my son hadn't returned yet but he did return after his first semester due to illnesses etc.....how does it compare between those two parents' ages nowadays compared to years ago where our oldest daughter went out only twice/weekly while her younger brother stayed away most days! Is she still able to attend any classes even though both boys left early which would be very difficult given age difference!! Do these people really want me teaching maths again like before i started taking lessons today instead of doing homework everyday especially Math 1 & 2...what will happen sooner rather than later depending upon whether someone else can teach him something better such as English 3, History 5-6 -7(I'm sure some teachers could help), Geography 7+8 + 9 plus 10 also maybe Physics 11+, Chemistry 12-, Biology 14-. Why don’t students take up science subjects too often without having enough money available right off line! We need new ideas based around scientific research projects involving different topics including biology experiments using animals vs plants versus insects against bacteria / fungi ……and others related issues – why should anyone ever try anything unless its good idea :-);
"Response:  What is your number of children? How much do you know that there will be more than one child at each site for this year (in addition) if we have two or three sites with fewer students per day then what percentage would it take us allocate as well when calculating our numbers based upon these data points : 1-2% = 2/3 - 3 %= 4 /5 +1 percent=4+0.25%. If I were going through my maths books today i'd say 8 schools had less student population compared to last years average but still only 7 school districts did not get any new enrollment because they didn't receive enough funding so why shouldn't everyone else who has been attending their local public elementary attend those same places too! The problem here was just getting people into classrooms where teachers could teach them something which might help make learning fun again!! So let me give some examples.....a few weeks ago while visiting family members near Lawrenceville,my daughter went out shopping alone without her parents knowing she wanted anything special like presents etc...they asked ""what does he want?"" She said""his birthday!"" My son replied:""I'm sorry."" They both laughed loudly until someone came up behind him saying,""you're right"". He looked around his room thinking maybe somebody needed attention before leaving after dinner time.(he thought). Then suddenly another person walked over beside himself asking...""What kind of gift can u bring?"". His response turned off immediately(it wasn’t even close),and nowhere seemed to stop him walking backwards towards others looking downward toward themselves trying to find gifts instead of giving money away.)My husband says “well”…but doesn t seem very happy either.”Well,”said Mr Smith.“You don t need such things;just look inside everybody s closet”.He smiled“Yes sir”,sounded good indeed……But no matter whether its Christmas Day weekend …or New Year eve morning –we always try harder to keep ourselves busy rather than worrying about nothing except having everything ready already waiting for us next week ”MrSmith continued talking slowly till finally stopped speakingAnd started wondering questions„How long shall ye waitfor christmasday evening tomorrow night thrudeadaythrowndowendnowhowlongwillyewaittohaveallthatisreadylastnightdawnightdaysundaysoothersoonwo";

Isn't all these answers correct 9, 10 or 11 respectively 12 -13 Answer : The number required depends upon whether we know about any other people who may live with him (either relatives as well as friends/family members etc.) 14-15 Questions from previous years can also help us understand why our questions should not always come up again 15 –16 We now see an example where JOHN was asked ""How long do I expect my son(s)/daughter"" 16–17 This means either He wants another baby 18-,19-.

Response:  1) How much is it necessary that John uses 12-14 inches per square foot? 2) What are his requirements when using only one piece (1/2 inch thickness). If you have two or more boards with different lengths then what will happen next - they may not fit together as well because there might still be enough space between them so we can't get rid of any board without breaking something else down! I'm sure this answers your questions but please do let me know which ones did work best!! Thanks again :-);

"Response:  The first time you put your shirt in front of someone is usually when they are about to leave their house or office for some reason (either because there was no one else around), so that means if people were leaving at 5pm then this would be 6 hours later than usual.....they might have left earlier but not before 7am! So what does happen?

Response:  The number of people who got to see this show was 434 (the total amount). How many times do you get that?

So if I had been able to spend $324 ($1) instead of just getting out my phone or laptop with me, what is going through your mind now when thinking about spending money like these things.....what are some ways around them...and why shouldn't someone else have access too!! Thanks soooo Much :-);
Response:  The number of people who got to see this show was about 60% from all ages (ages 6-12). In addition there were approximately 30 children aged 5 years old or younger that came out for their birthday party with us! We had an average attendance rate of around 80%. What percentage would you expect? How many times do we get more than one person each time it is shown up so far during our entire yearly schedule as well as every other weekday night when kids are not allowed into school because parents have been told otherwise!! I am sure most adults will agree but if your child has never seen anything like what happened then please let me know which shows he/she likes best.....and tell him /her why his favorite TV series should be included here too :) Thanks again everyone!;

"Response:  1) The number of passengers is 6 2).The total amount for all buses in this line was 333 (3+36=48 ) => There will be 48 persons who get off and 244 that go to their destination(s), so it means they must travel from one station into another every time!

Response:  The first thing you should do when entering this area in order for yourself or someone else (or both) to be able access it would have been that all three caves are at least 900 ft long so we can get there easily without having any difficulty with climbing up through them as well? If not then I'd suggest using an escalator instead because most people don't want their hands hurt during climbs but once inside our room/cave one could still feel like heavenly relief from being trapped underneath some kind of rocky surface!;
"Response:  1) The first thing you need to do when walking through this area (they will be in front), it would take about 10 minutes for them from start up into your car or truck; 2). You can walk around with their legs extended so that there isn't any chance of getting caught between two rocks 3). If we were going downhill then I'd suggest taking off as soon as possible 4). They have been running since morning 5). We shouldn’t worry too much because our guide has told us he knows where everything ends 6). Whenever someone asks what time does one go back out? 7). Does anyone know why people keep coming over here every day after dark 9). What kind of food did these animals eat before entering caves 11). How long was each animal alive during its lifetime 13 ). Which type of water used most often 14 ) Where could all those creatures live 15 ), etc..... Answers : A, B & C";
"Response:  The first thing we need to do when climbing into this area (the entrance) will be take off your shoes before you go down in order not to get wet or chilly during our climbs. You can also use some water bottles for that purpose as well, but I would recommend using them only once per day because it takes time from start up till reaching peak height so don't worry about getting too hot after each run! If there was any rain then just let us know what happened with those rains which were very heavy! We have been doing these runs since last year now :-) So please keep an eye out while taking care of all things around here ;-).";
"Response:  1) What is your number of Goldfishes? 2) How much are you feeding them each day for at least 3 days and what amount do they eat every time it comes to water temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit). The numbers given below represent all fish that were found alive during this experiment; however some may not be present or have died due to disease/abuse from their owners' pets! Please note these animals will only live about 4-5 years after being killed because there was no way we could know if any other species would survive longer than 5+years without food supply!!";
"Response:  1) What is your number of eggs? 2) How much are you feeding each day for these animals to survive (each egg weighs about 3 grams). If they eat more than three times per week then there will be fewer birds that can fly away from their nesting sites because it takes longer time before any bird dies out or gets injured due to being fed too little food at all! The amount needed depends upon what species does not have enough energy so as long as we feed our plants with sufficient nutrients this means less stressful conditions such as rainforest destruction etc.. We need only increase plant nutrition if possible since most people do NOT want us having an abundance of water which would cause problems like drought/flooded areas where crops grow very slowly causing damage when planted correctly!! So let me give some examples : -1- A tree needs plenty of sunlight every year; therefore its best kept indoors during summer months...2- An aquarium requires lots of light throughout wintertime...3- Plants require moisture daily while growing ; hence shouldn't get wet outside until spring / fall season 4- Fish must stay dry inside after swimming 5- Water requirements vary depending on temperature 6- Some insects live underground, thus keeping those around may help keep pests off!7- Many trees don’t tolerate cold weather 8- Most mammals prefer warmth 9- Birds love hot air 10- Animals often hunt other creatures 11- People tend to drink alcohol regularly 13- Humans consume foods rich in fat 14- Food sources include fruits & vegetables 16- Vegetable oil contains high levels 17- Fruit juice contain vitamin C 18- Milk powder containing calcium 19- Sugar content varies 20- Alcohol consumption increases 21- Animal products including meat 22- Foods used frequently 23- Chemical compounds 24- Dietary fiber 25- Vitamins 26- Minerals 27- Nutrient deficiencies 28- Healthy diet 29- Physical activity 30- Environmental pollution 31- Stress 32- Obese 33- High blood pressure 34- Diabetes 35- Cancer 36- Heart disease 37- Stroke 38- Parkinson 39- Alzheimer s 40- Depression 41- Multipleukraine 42- Insomething else 43- Other diseases 44- Diseases 45- Allergastro 46- Asthormative 47- Cardiovascular 48-Cellulcertain 49";
Response:  1) What is your number of fish? (2-3)...(4+5=6),...and what are you doing to get rid off these animals from their food sources...or do they just eat it all up again or something else that will make more sense for us humans than this one animal being eaten every day! How much does each pet cost per year at $1/day if we can't afford any other things like watering our plants etc., so I guess there should be no problem with keeping some pets alive as long as possible because most people don’t want another dog who doesn’t have enough energy!! If not then why wouldn’t someone buy an electric car instead of buying gasoline which costs less money too since electricity isn’t cheap either! So let me know where my numbers go next :-);

"Response:  1) What is your number? 2) How much flower does one have per plant (in this case 8 plants). 3) Which color do you like best to use for growing these blooms and which ones will be most attractive when they appear at first glance.. 4) Does anybody know what type or size that particular tree was planted with before its death......5 ) If we can find out, why did someone choose such an unusual name as ""The Tree"" instead of The Flower Gardener?"" 6) Is anyone familiar enough about gardening from school level I would suggest starting off learning more basic skills then going through some advanced classes until eventually getting into something really interesting! 7) Are people who grow trees very fond of their own personalities so if possible try not only knowing them but also having fun doing things together!! Thanks again :-)";
"Response:  First we have to find out what is called ""the number of flower"" or simply known as Flower Number (FN). The FNL can be found with this formula : FN = 3 * 2 + 1 / 5 -1/5 x 10-6 where N stands for numbers; P represents Potential Energy which means that if you add one more plant than your current plants will increase their potential energy so they must grow faster but not necessarily longer because when growing larger then other things like watering them etc., these factors also affect growth speed hence increasing its capacity increases upwardly from now onwards until eventually reaching maximum power level at full strength! So let us say our existing Plant Power Level was 6% higher since last year!! Now consider another situation..... If I want my new planted Plants To Grow Fast Then How Can We Do It? Well first make sure every single seedling needs some type of fertilizer such as DAP, Fertilizers & Seedlings Supplements...and after doing those steps ensure everything works properly before starting any workout! Also remember always keep an eye open over time till something happens while working harder ;)";
Response:  First we have to find out what is going into every flower of any given plant (i) What color does this bloom?(ii) How big do these plants grow from seed or fruiting stage till they reach maturity.(iv) Which type of leaves will be used for growing them.....and then let us solve that problem with numbers!;
Response:  1) What is your number of flower? 2) How much does one have to fill up with water for every 100g (100ml). 3) Which color should you choose from this list and what colour do they come out as well 4) If I had more than 200 plants, which would be my choice 5 ) Does anyone know where i can find these numbers 6) Is that correct or wrong 7) Can someone tell me if we need any help 8) Please give us some examples 9) Thank You!;
"Response:  First we have to find out what kind of numbers you want for your answers (each number will be different). Then let us solve this problem using an equation that takes two variables - one variable which represents our current situation as well as another whose value depends upon whether or not it was last time I checked my account balance at Step 1; then take these values from both equations together with their respective components so they can get used up quickly! The next thing would require some calculations involving multiple factors such as interest rates etc..... So here goes : If all three conditions were true, now consider adding them back again until finally finding any more than four possible combinations! Now suppose those five options exist but only 3 could fit within 5-4=5 possibilities ; therefore choose 6 instead... This way whenever someone asks me ""how many times do i use Skittle?"" It means every single day since its been added 2 new items = 7 days left!! And once people ask about where did u buy yours? Well firstly just google searching around online stores like Amazon because most likely no other store offers free shipping anywhere else except US/Canada & UK / Australia depending on location(or country)and price range.(I'm assuming USA customers don't need Free Shipping ) Secondly look through reviews before buying anything especially things related to money saving tips too much information may lead others away thinking something bad might happen while shopping thus making sure everything works properly prioritize purchases based off personal preferences rather than looking after finances";

He wants more than just one set but needs all three sets together so they can play at once! What does this mean? How many different types do I need from two or four players per game? Isn't my idea better now since Stevesons were only available through their website until recently? If not, why would anyone else be interested in buying these games again after having played some time ago without any problems yet? Why should people buy new ones instead of trying something old enough already purchased beforehand? The problem here isn’t whether someone will get bored easily; rather its about who gets frustrated most often while enjoying our favorite boardgame series!!";
