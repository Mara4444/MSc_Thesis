Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 18 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 10 children. So, we have to find out how many more children La Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, La Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 11 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 12 children more than on Monday. So, the number of children she played with on Tuesday was: 11 + 12 = 23 children. Therefore, La Julia played with 23 children on Tuesday more than she did on Monday.
Response:  We know that La Julia played with 5 children on Monday and with some other children on Tuesday. So, we can write an equation:  Number of children she played with on Monday + number of children she played with on Tuesday = Total number of children she played with.  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  On Monday, she played with 5 children, so we have:  Number of children she played with on Monday = 5.  And on Tuesday, she played with some other children (not specified how many), so we have:  Number of children she played with on Tuesday = x.  Now, we want to find out how many children she played with in total:  Total number of children she played with = Number of children she played with on Monday + Number of children she played with on Tuesday  Total number of children she played with = 5 + x  Therefore, the answer is:  Total number of children she played with = 9.
Response:  If La Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and she played with a total of 16 children, then she must have played with 2 more children than she did on Tuesday. So, she played with 14 + 2 = 16 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 16 children), and Tuesday (La Julia played with 12 more children). So, in total, La Julia played with 16 + 12 = 28 children. Therefore, La Julia played with 28 children on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), she played with 8 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 14 children. So, in total, she played with 22 children (8 + 14).
Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 17 children), Tuesday (La Julia played with 15 children), and Thursday (La Julia played with 2 children). So in total, La Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 18 children. So, in total, La Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children on those two days.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 5 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 9 children. And on Thursday (dimecres), she played with 15 children. So, in total, La Julia played with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children. Therefore, La Julia played with 30 children on Monday and Thursday.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 2 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 14 children. And on Thursday (dimecres), she played with 16 children. So, in total, La Julia played with 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 children. Therefore, La Julia played with 32 children on Tuesday and Thursday.
Response:  On Monday, La Julia played with 9 children. On Tuesday, she played with 7 children. And on Thursday, she played with 96 children. So, we can write down an equation: Number of children La Julia played with on Monday = Number of children La Julia played with on Tuesday + Number of children La Julia played with on Thursday - Number of children La Julia played with on Wednesday (since there is no information about Wednesday). Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children La Julia played with on Monday = 9 Children played with on Tuesday + 7 Children played with on Thursday - No children played with on Wednesday ( since there is no information about Wednesday) Substituting the values, we get: 9 = 7 + x - 0 where x is the number of children La Julia played with on Thursday. Solving for x, we get: x = 21 Since La Julia played with 21 more children on Thursday than she did on Tuesday, the answer to the question is: More children played with La Julia on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 14 children), Tuesday (2 children), and Thursday (8 children). So, we have:
Monday = 14 children
Tuesday = 2 children
Thursday = 8 children
Now, let's compare how many children played each day:
Monday > Tuesday (14 > 2)
Monday < Thursday (14 < 8)
So, La Julia played with more children on Monday than on Thursday. Therefore, the answer is:
A - More children played with La Julia on Monday than on Thursday."
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 8 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 11 children. And on Thursday (dimecres), she played with 9 children. So, we have: 8 + 11 + 9 = 28 children that La Julia played with in total. Now, let's find out how many more children La Julia played with on Tuesday than on Thursday: 11 - 9 = 2 more children. Therefore, La Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Thursday.
Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 15 children), Tuesday (La Julia played with 18 children), and Thursday (La Julia played with 7 children). So, we have three different situations:  Monday - 15 children, Tuesday - 18 children, Thursday - 7 children. Now, let's compare these numbers:  Monday > Tuesday (15 > 18) and Thursday < Monday (7 < 15). Therefore, La Julia played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday, and fewer children on Thursday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 10 children. And on Thursday (dimecres), she played with 15 children. Therefore, in total, La Julia played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 7 children), Tuesday (La Julia played with 13 children), and Thursday (La Julia played with 20 children). So in total, La Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  On Monday (La Julia played with 12 children), she spent 12 hours playing with them. So, the number of hours she spent playing with all the children = 12 hours + 34 hours = 46 hours. Therefore, she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), La Julia played with 19 children and passed a total of 38 hours playing cards.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played with 18 children and passed a total of 38 hours playing cards again. So, we can write an equation based on this information:  Total time = Number of children x Time per child  In Monday, La Julia played with 19 children for a total of 38 hours, so:  Time = 19 x 2 = 38 hours  Similarly, in Tuesday, La Julia played with 18 children for a total of 38 hours, so:  Time = 18 x 2 = 36 hours  Now, to find out how many more hours La Julia played with the children on Monday than on Tuesday, we subtract the time she played with 18 children from the time she played with 19 children:  Hours difference = 38 - 36 = 2 hours  Therefore, La Julia played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday by 2 hours.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), she played cards with 6 children.  On Tuesday (dimarts), she played pelota with 5 children. So, we can say that the number of children she played with on Monday is greater than the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of children she played with on Monday minus the number of children she played with on Tuesday.  We are given that she played with 6 children on Monday and 5 children on Tuesday, so we can calculate the difference as follows:  Difference = 6 - 5 = 1.  Therefore, she played with 1 more child on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that La Julia played with 18 children in total and she played with four of them on Monday. So, the number of children she played with on Monday is 4. Now, we are told that she also played with some more children on Tuesday. But how many did she play with exactly? Well, if she played with 4 children on Monday, then she must have played with at least 4 + 4 = 8 more children on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer to the question is 8.
Response:  We know that La Julia played with four children on Thursday (dimecres in Spanish). Therefore, we can say that she played with x number of children on Thursday.  On Monday (dilluns), she played with six children, so we can write down 6 = x + y, where y is the number of children she played with on Monday.  Now, let's consider Tuesday (dimarts): we are told that she played with 17 children on this day. So, we can write down 6 = x + y - z, where z is the number of children she did not play with on Tuesday.  Substituting the values we have found, we get: 6 = x + y -z 4 = x + y - 17  Solving for x and y, we find that x = 8 and y = 9. Therefore, La Julia played with 8 + 9 = 17 children on Monday.
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 25 more pieces of candy after he had already eaten some initially, then we can say that he has eaten a total of x + 25 pieces of candy where 'x' is the number of pieces he had initially. Now, we are asked to find out how many pieces of candy Bobby had initially. So, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the question as follows:  Number of pieces of candy Bobby had initially = x + 25  Since Bobby has eaten a total of 43 pieces of candy, we can substitute this value into the equation above:  x + 25 = 43  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x = 18  Therefore, Bobby had initially eaten 18 pieces of candy before he started eating more.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 caramels and then he ate 42 more. So, in total, he ate 28 + 42 = 70 caramels. Additionally, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to one caramel, Bobby ate 63 / 1 = 63 caramels in total. Therefore, Bobby ate 70 + 63 = 133 caramels.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 33 caramels initially and then he added 4 more, so he has eaten a total of 37 caramels (33 + 4). Additionally, he has eaten 14 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Bobby has eaten 51 trossos of caramel and chocolate (37 + 14).
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 38 caramels and then he ate 36 more. So, in total, he has eaten 74 caramels (38 + 36). Now, we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to 2 caramels, Bobby has eaten a total of 32 caramels from the chocolate (16 / 2 = 32). Therefore, the number of caramels that Bobby has eaten more than chocolate is 42 (74 - 32)
Response:  First, Bobby ate 20 caramels. Then he ate 34 more pieces of caramel. So far, he has eaten a total of 54 caramels (20 + 34 = 54). Finally, he ate 18 more caramels, bringing his total to 72 caramels (54 + 18 = 72). Therefore, Bobby has menjat 72 caramels in total.
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of caramel to start with. He ate 5 pieces, so he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces left now. Therefore, there are 7 pieces of caramel left for Bobby.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of caramel. Then he ate some (but how many?). After that, he ate 5 more pieces. So, at this point, Bobby has eaten a total of 5 + 5 = 10 pieces of caramel. Now, we are asked how many pieces of caramel Bobby still has. Therefore, the number of pieces of caramel Bobby still has is equal to 22 - 10 = 12 pieces of caramel.
Response:  Bobby had 19 caramels and he ate 2 of them. So, now he has 19 - 2 = 17 caramels left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of caramel initially and he ate some, then he has fewer pieces now. We can assume that he ate an equal number of caramels as he originally had (i.e., 32 / 4 = 8). So, after eating some caramels, Bobby has 32 - 8 = 24 pieces of caramel left. Therefore, if he has 20 caramels remaining, it means he ate 4 more than what he initially had (20 - 4 = 16). Thus, Bobby ate 16 caramels in total.
Response:  Initially, Bobby had 36 caramels and he ate 17 of them. So, now he has 36 - 17 = 19 caramels left. Then, he eats another 15 caramels, so now he has 19 - 15 = 4 caramels left. Therefore, Bobby has 4 caramels left.
Response:  Initially, Bobby had 30 caramels and he ate 23 of them. So, now he has 7 caramels left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  We know that Alan had 5 globes and Jake had 3 globes at the park. So, we can say that the total number of globes they both had together is 5 + 3 = 8 globes. Therefore, Alan had more globes than Jake at the park, with a difference of 5 - 3 = 2 globes.
"Response:  We know that Alan had 2 globes and Jake had 3 globes at the park. So, we can write this information as an equation: 
Alan = 2 globus 
Jake = 3 globus 
Now, let's find out how many globes Jake had more than Alan: 
Difference between Jake and Alan = Jake - Alan 
= 3 - 2 
= 1 globe 
So, Jake had one globe more than Alan at the park."
Response:  If Allan carried 2 globes to the park and he also carried 1 globe with him, then Jake carried 3 - (2 + 1) = 3 globes to the park. Therefore, Jake carried 3 globes to the park.
Response:  If Jake carried 6 globes to the park and he carried 4 more than Allan, then we can say that Allan carried x globes to the park. Since Jake carried 6 + 4 = 10 globes in total, we can set up an equation as follows:  x + 4 = 10. Now solve for x :  x = 6. So Allan carried 6 globes to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 globes to the park, then Jake brought 6 more globes than what Allan brought. So, if Allan brought x globes, then Jake brought 6 + x globes. Now we are given that Jake brought 6 more globes than Allan, so we can write an equation as follows: 6 + x = 5 + y where y is the number of globes that Allan brought. Solving for y, we get: y = 1. Therefore, Jake brought 6 + x = 6 + 1 = 7 globes to the park.
"Response: 
Alan had 3 globus to start with and then he bought 2 more, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 globus. 
Jake had 5 globus to start with. 
So in total they have 5 (Alan) + 5 (Jake) = 10 globus at the park."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan brought 2 globes and Jake brought 4 globes to the park. So, together they had 6 globes at the park. Then, Alan bought 3 more globes at the park. Therefore, the total number of globes that Alan had at the park was 6 + 3 = 9 globes. Now, compare this with the number of globes that Jake had at the park. We know that Jake had 4 globes at the park initially. So, the difference between the number of globes that Alan had and the number of globes that Jake had is 9 - 4 = 5 globes. Hence, Allan had 5 more globes than Jake at the park.
Response:  We know that: * Alan brought 2 globes to the park. * Jake brought 6 globes to the park. * Alan bought 3 more globes at the park. So, we can write down what we know so far: 2 + 6 = 8 globes in total at the park (Alan and Jake combined). Now, let's find out how many globes Jake had at the park compared to Alan: 8 - 3 = 5 globes left at the park after Alan bought his additional ones (Jake had fewer globes than Alan). Therefore, Jake had 5 globes less than Alan at the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan brought 5 globes to the park and Jake brought 4 globes. So together they have 9 globes (5 + 4 = 9). Then, Alan bought 3 more globes at the park. Therefore, the total number of globes that Alan had in the park is 9 + 3 = 12 globes.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 6 globes to the park and Jake brought 2 globes to the park. So far, they have 8 globes between them (6 + 2 = 8). Then we are told that Jake bought 3 more globes at the park. Now Jake has 3 + 2 = 5 globes. Therefore, Alan has 8 - 5 = 3 globes more than Jake at the park.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 6 globes and Jake brought 3 globes to the park. So together they had 6 + 3 = 9 globes at the park. Then we are told that Jake bought 4 more globes at the park. Therefore, the total number of globes Jake had at the park is 9 + 4 = 13 globes. So, the difference in the number of globes Jake had at the park compared to Alan is 13 - 9 = 4 globes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan brought 5 globus to the park and Jake brought 6 globus. So together they have 11 globus (5 + 6 = 11). Now, we are told that Jake bought 3 more globus at the park. Therefore, the total number of globus Jake had is 11 + 3 = 14.  So, Jake brought 14 globus to the park.
Response:  We know that Alan had 3 globus and 20 boles in total. So if he brought them to the park, he would have 3 + 20 = 23 objects in total. Now we are told that Jake had 5 globus and 59 boles in total. If he also brought them to the park, then he would have 5 + 59 = 64 objects in total. Therefore, the number of globus in the park is 64 - 23 = 41 globus.
Response:  We know that Alan brought 7 globes and 5 balls to the park, so he had a total of 7 + 5 = 12 objects in the park. Similarly, we know that Jake brought 6 globes and 4 balls to the park, so he had a total of 6 + 4 = 10 objects in the park. Therefore, the number of balls that both Alan and Jake together had in the park is 12 (Alan) + 10 (Jake) = 22 balls.
Response:  If Allan has brought 5 globes to the park and he and Jake together have brought a total of 6 globes to the park, then Jake must have brought 1 globe to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 globes to the park and then bought 3 more. So, in total, Allan had 5 globes at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now we are told that Jake brought 6 globes to the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of globes Allan had and the number of globes Jake had is equal to the number of globes Jake had minus the number of globes Allan had. In other words, we can write an equation as follows: Number of globes Jake had - Number of globes Allan had = 6 - 5 = 1. So, Jake had one more globe than Allan at the park.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 2 hours learning Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent learning Chinese from the total time spent learning both languages. So, let's do that:
Total time spent learning both languages = Time spent learning English + Time spent learning Chinese = 6 + 2 = 8 hours/day
Now, let's find out how many hours Ryan spends learning English compared to Chinese:
Time spent learning English - Time spent learning Chinese = 8 - 2 = 6 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 6 hours more learning English than Chinese every day."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent learning English from the time spent learning Chinese. So, the difference is: 6 - 7 = -1 hour/day. Therefore, Ryan dedicates -1 hour less per day to learning Chinese than he does to learning English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and some more hours learning Chinese every day, then he spends a total of 4 hours learning both languages together. So, if he learns English for 3 hours per day, he learns Chinese for (4 - 3) = 1 hour per day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours learning English and some more hours learning Chinese, then he spends total of x hours learning Chinese. Since he spends 2 hours more than he does in learning English, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 7 + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9
Therefore, Ryan spends 9 hours learning Chinese."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and some more time learning English, then he spends total of x hours learning English. Since he spends 2 hours more learning English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours learning English."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of:

English: 6 hours/day × 5 days = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 hours/day × 5 days = 35 hours
Total time spent learning both languages = 30 + 35 = 65 hours."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day he will have spent a total of:

6 hours + 5 hours = 11 hours

So, if he does this for 2 days, he will have spent a total of:

11 hours/day x 2 days = 22 hours

Therefore, Ryan passes 22 hours learning English in total."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours learning English every day and 4 hours learning Chinese. If he learns for 6 days, how many hours does he spend learning Chinese in total?
To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends learning English per day by the number of days he learns English, then add that result to the number of hours he spends learning Chinese per day multiplied by the number of days he learns Chinese.
So, if Ryan spends 5 hours learning English per day and learns for 6 days, he will have spent a total of 30 hours (5 x 6) learning English. And if he spends 4 hours learning Chinese per day and learns for 6 days, he will have spent a total of 24 hours (4 x 6) learning Chinese. Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 54 hours (30 + 24) learning both languages combined."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he learns for a total of 86 days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

English = Total hours spent learning / Number of days spent learning
= 4h/86d

Similarly, we can calculate the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese per day:

Chinese = Total hours spent learning / Number of days spent learning
= 6h/86d

Now, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends learning each language per day. We can do this by dividing the number of hours he spends learning each language per day by the number of days he has been learning that language:

Hours learning English per day = English / Days spent learning English
= 4h/43d (since Ryan has been learning English for 43 days)

Hours learning Chinese per day = Chinese / Days spent learning Chinese
= 6h/43d (since Ryan has been learning Chinese for 43 days)

So, Ryan spends approximately 2.5 hours per day learning English and 3.7 hours per day learning Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day. So, in one week (7 days), he learns 6 x 7 = 42 hours of English. 
He also spends 7 hours learning Chinese and 3 hours learning Spanish every day. Therefore, in one week, he learns 7 x 7 = 49 hours of Chinese and 3 x 7 = 21 hours of Spanish.  In total, Ryan learns 42 + 49 + 21 = 102 hours of English, Chinese, and Spanish in one week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day. Then, he spends 3 hours learning Chinese and 58 hours learning Spanish. So, in total, Ryan spends 6 + 3 + 58 = 77 hours per day studying languages. Therefore, Ryan dedicates more time to learning English than Xinhes (Chinese).
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours learning English every day. He also spends 2 hours learning Chinese and 4 hours learning Spanish. So, in total, he spends 7 + 2 = 9 hours per day studying languages. Therefore, he dedicates more time to learning English than to learning Spanish, as he spends 9 hours learning English compared to 7 hours learning Spanish.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours learning English every day and 5 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 2/6 = 1/3 of his time spent studying languages.  Similarly, he learns Spanish for 4/6 = 2/3 of his time spent studying languages. So, he dedicates more time to learn Chinese than Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English each day, then he learns English for 3 hours/day = 21 hours/week (since there are 7 days in a week).  Now, if he spends 2 hours learning English each day, then he learns English for 2 hours/day = 14 hours/week (again, since there are 7 days in a week). Therefore, Ryan spends 21 - 14 = 7 hours per week learning Chinese.
Response:  Day 1: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 4 + 5 = 9 hours.  Days 2-7: Ryan continues to spend 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, for each of these days, he will have spent an additional 4 + 5 = 9 hours. In total, then, over the course of 7 days, Ryan has spent 9 + 9 = 18 hours learning English and 18 + 18 = 36 hours learning Chinese. So in total, Ryan has spent 36 hours learning English and 36 hours learning Chinese.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bidon bottles to recycle. The next day, she found 7 more plastic bottles. So, how many bidon bottles did Tiffany have in total after finding those additional bottles?  Total number of bidon bottles = Number of bidon bottles on Monday + Number of plastic bottles found the next day  Total number of bidon bottles = 8 + 7  Total number of bidon bottles = 15
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bottles of water. The next day she found 12 more plastic bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 7 + 12 = 19 bottles.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 bags of bottles to recycle. If she found more bags of milk cartons on Tuesday, then the total number of bags she found is equal to the number of bags she already had plus the new ones she found. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bags = 4 + X Where X is the number of additional bags found on Tuesday. Now, we are given that Tiffany found more bags of milk cartons on Tuesday. We can substitute this value in the equation above and solve for X. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected bottles to recycle. The next day, she found four plastic bags. If she had a total of eight bags on Monday, how many bags did she find the next day?  We can deduce that Tiffany found two additional bags of bottles the next day. Therefore, the answer is 8 + 2 = 10. So, Tiffany found ten bags of bottles the next day.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 10 bidons to recycle. The next day she found 3 more bidons of latte and the following day she found 7 more bidons of latte. So in total, Tiffany had 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bidons to recycle.
Response:  On Monday (dilluns), Tiffany found 8 bidon bottles to recycle. Then, she found 10 more bidon bottles on Tuesday (següent) and 4 more on Wednesday (dia següent). So, in total, Tiffany found $10 + 4 = 14$ bidon bottles after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 3 bottles of juice. If she found 7 more bottles of juice and 44 more bottles of soda, then the total number of bottles she found is:  Total = 3 + 7 + 44 = 54 bottles. So, Tiffany had 54 bottles of juice and soda in total.
"Response:  We have 17 red balls and 16 green balls in the basket. To find out how many more red balls than green balls there are, we need to subtract the number of green balls from the total number of balls. So, if we subtract 16 (the number of green balls) from 17 (the number of red balls), we get:

17 - 16 = 1

Therefore, there is one more red ball than green ball in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red balls and 11 green balls in the basket. To find out how many more green balls than red balls there are, we can use the following equation: Number of green balls = Total number of balls - Number of red balls So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of green balls = 26 (total number of balls) - 5 (number of red balls) = 21 Therefore, there are 21 more green balls than red balls in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red fish in the basket and 5 green fish. So, if we add both together, we get 15 fish in total. Now, we want to know how many of them are green. Therefore, we can say that among the 15 fish, there are 5 green ones.
Response:  We know that there are three red birds in the basket and ten green birds outside the basket. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get... (3 + 10 = 13)...thirteen birds in total! Therefore, there are thirteen green birds in the basket.
Response:  We have 7 red ants (vermes) and 15 grey ants (persegudes grogues). Then we have 8 green ants (persegudes verdes). So in total, there are 7 + 15 = 22 ants in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red peppers (pessecs vermells), which means we have 7 x 3 = 21 units of red color in total. Now, let's count how many green peppers (persegus grocs) and yellow peppers (verds) there are: There are 71 green peppers (persegus grocs) and 8 yellow peppers (verds). So, the total number of green peppers is 71, and the total number of yellow peppers is 8. Therefore, the number of yellow peppers is less than the number of red peppers. In fact, there are 71/8 = 9 fewer yellow peppers than red peppers.
Response:  We have 2 red peppers (verts), which means we have 2 x 5 = 10 units of red peppers in total. Then, we have 6 green peppers (groc), which means we have 6 x 3 = 18 units of green peppers in total. Finally, we have 14 yellow peppers (verds), which means we have 14 x 4 = 56 units of yellow peppers in total. So, there are more yellow peppers than green peppers in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 56 - 18 = 38 yellow peppers more than green peppers in the basket.
Response:  We have 19 red marbles and 11 green marbles in the basket. To find out how many more red marbles than green marbles there are, we need to subtract the number of green marbles from the total number of marbles. So, we can write: Number of red marbles = Total number of marbles - Number of green marbles  In this case, the total number of marbles is 19 + 11 = 30 marbles. Therefore, the number of red marbles is: Number of red marbles = 30 - 11 = 19 marbles. So, there are 19 more red marbles than green marbles in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 90 pieces of orange fish and 16 pieces of green fish in the basket.  To find out how many red fish there are, we need to subtract the number of green fish from the total number of fish. So, if there are 90 orange fish and 16 green fish, then there are 90 - 16 = 74 red fish in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red marbles and 14 green marbles in the basket. To find out how many green marbles there are, we can subtract the number of red marbles from the total number of marbles: 18 + 14 = 32. So, there are 32 marbles in total. Now, let's find out how many green marbles there are: 32 - 14 = 18. Therefore, there are 18 green marbles in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red penceis and 6 green penceis in the basket. So, we have a total of 5 + 6 = 11 penceis in the basket. Since we also know that there are 14 black penceis in the basket, we can conclude that there are 11 - 14 = -3 black penceis in the basket. Therefore, there are no black penceis in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 65 cistelles of fish in total. Each cistella has 7 red fish and 3 green fish. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Red fish = 7 x 65 = 455 Green fish = 3 x 65 = 195 Total fish = Red + Green = 455 + 195 = 650 Therefore, there are 650 fish in total.
"Response:  We have 11 cistelles of peppers. Each cistella has 10 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So, in total we have:

Red peppers: 10 x 11 = 110
Green peppers: 18 x 11 = 208
Total number of peppers: 110 + 208 = 318
Therefore, there are 318 peppers in total at the cistelles."
Response:  We know that each cistella has 16 red fish and 18 green fish. So, in total, there are 16 + 18 = 34 fish of both colors. Since we want to find out how many red fish there are, let's subtract the number of green fish from the total number of fish: 34 - 18 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 red fish in total at the cistelles.
Response:  We know that each cistella has 10 red fish and 2 green fish. So, in total, there are 10 + 2 = 12 fish per cistella. Since we have 5 cistelles, the total number of fish is 12 x 5 = 60 fish. Among these 60 fish, 2 are green, so the number of green fish is 2/60 = 3/20. Therefore, there are 3 green fish in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 fish in total and each basket has 4 red fish and 3 green fish. So, we can write this information as an equation: 4R + 3G = 7.  Now, let's solve for G (the number of green fish): G = 7 - 4R. Substituting R = 4, we get G = 3. Therefore, there are 3 baskets of fish.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 cistelles of fish and each cistella has 4 red fish and some green ones. So, in total, we have 3 x 4 = 12 red fish. Now, let's find out how many green fish there are in each cistella. Since there are ""poques"" (a little) more green fish than red fish, we can assume that there are an equal number of green fish as red fish in each cistella. Therefore, the number of green fish in each cistella is also 4. So, the total number of green fish is 12 x 4 = 48 green fish."
Response:  We know that there are 16 peppers in the basket and 13 of them are red. So, we have to find out how many green peppers are left. Since there are more than just a few green peppers, let's assume that there are x green peppers in the basket. Therefore, the number of red peppers is 13, and the number of green peppers is x. Now, we can use the information given in the question to determine the value of x. According to the problem statement, if there are 13 red peppers and some green ones, then the total number of peppers in the basket is 16 (the initial amount) plus the number of green peppers (x). So, we can set up the equation as follows: 16 + x = 13 + x. Simplifying the equation, we get: 29 = 2x. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we obtain: x = 14. Therefore, there are 14 green peppers in the basket.
"Response:  We know that each fishing basket has 19 red fish and 4 green fish. Therefore, if we have 15 fishing baskets, we will have:

Red fish: 15 x 19 = 285 red fish
Green fish: 15 x 4 = 60 green fish
In total, there are 285 + 60 = 345 fish."
Response:  We have 10 people distributed equally in boxes. Each box has 4 red fish and 6 green fish. So, we can write this information as an equation: 10x + 4y = 40 (where x is the number of red fish and y is the number of green fish). Now, we are asked to find out how many boxes there are. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 10: 10x + 4y = 40 / 10 = 4x + 4y = 4. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 4 and y = 6. Therefore, there are 4 boxes with only red fish and 6 boxes with only green fish.
Response:  We have 6 green fish and 2 red fish in the basket. To find out how many more green fish there are than red fish, we need to subtract the number of red fish from the total number of fish. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of green fish = Total number of fish - Number of red fish In this case, the total number of fish is 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, the number of green fish is: Number of green fish = 8 - 2 = 6 So, there are 6 more green fish than red fish in the basket.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added some more action figures to the platform. So, there are now 8 action figures in total. To find out how many action figures Jerry added to the platform, we can subtract the initial number of action figures (4) from the total number of action figures (8). Therefore, Jerry added 4 action figures to the platform.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had $4$ action figures in his room. Later, he added $3$ more action figures to the platform, making a total of $7$. So, initially Jerry had $4$ action figures in his room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 4 figures of action and 22 books in his room before the explosion. So, there were 4 + 22 = 26 objects in total. Later, he added 6 more figures of action to the platform, so now there are 26 + 6 = 32 objects in total. Therefore, there were 32 objects (figures of action) in Jerry's room after the explosion.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 5 figures of action and 9 books in his room before the explosion. So, there were 5 + 9 = 14 items in total.  Later, he added 7 more figures of action to the platform, so now there are 7 + 5 = 12 figures of action in total. Since each figure of action has 3 parts (head, body, arms), there are 12 x 3 = 36 parts of action in total. Now, let's count how many books Jerry had initially: 9 books. Therefore, the number of books Jerry had was 9. To find out how many figures of action Jerry had after adding 7 new ones, we need to subtract the initial number of books from the total number of items: 12 - 9 = 3 new figures of action. So, Jerry had 3 additional figures of action after the explosion.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had two action figures and ten books in his room. Later, he added four more action figures to the platform. So, the total number of action figures Jerry had is 2 + 4 = 6. Now, let's count how many books Jerry had initially. According to the question, Jerry had ten books in his room. Therefore, the final answer is 6 (action figures) + 10 (books) = 16.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books in his room at first. Later, he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books in Jerry's room is: 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 books. Therefore, there were 27 books in Jerry's room in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his room initially. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, now there are 2 + 4 = 6 books in total.  Now, let's count the number of action figures again: 7. Therefore, there were 7 action figures and 6 books in Jerry's room after he added the new books to the shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his room at first. Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of books is 2 + 9 = 11. Now, let's count how many action figures Jerry had initially: 5. Therefore, the final number of action figures Jerry had was 5.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the same room, so now there are 8 + 4 = 12 action figures in the room. Then, he took away 5 old action figures, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 new action figures in the room. Therefore, there were 7 new action figures in Jerry's room after he added and removed some figures.
Response:  If Jerry had 3 action figures in his room initially and later added 4 more, then he has a total of 7 action figures now (3 + 4 = 7).  Now, if he took some away from the shelf, that means he has fewer than 7 action figures left on the shelf. So, the number of action figures left on the shelf is 7 - x, where x is the number of action figures Jerry took away from the shelf. Since we know that Jerry took away some from the shelf, we can conclude that x > 0. Therefore, there are exactly 6 action figures left on the shelf (7 - x = 6).
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added more action figures to the room and took away 10 of the old ones. So, there are now x new action figures in the room, where x is the difference between the number of old action figures taken away (10) and the total number of action figures in the room after adding new ones (x). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of action figures in Jerry's room = 7 + x  Substituting the value given in the problem, we get:  Number of action figures in Jerry's room = 7 + x = 8  Therefore, Jerry added 1 new action figure to the room.
Response:  Initially, Jerry had $X$ action figures in his room. Later, he added $2$ more action figures to the room and removed $7$ of the old ones from the room. Now, there are $10$ action figures in the storage. So, we can write an equation: $X + 2 = 10$. Solving for $X$, we get $X = 8$. Therefore, initially Jerry had $8$ action figures in his room.
Response:  Firstly, Jerry had 9 action figures in his room explosion. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the platform. So, now there are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total.  Moreover, Jerry also had 10 books in his room explosion. Therefore, the total number of objects (action figures and books) that Jerry had was 16 + 10 = 26 items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room at first. So, there were 3 + 4 = 7 items altogether. Later, he added two more action figures to the platform, making it 7 + 2 = 9 items in total. Therefore, there were 9 figures of action more than books in Jerry's room after adding the new ones.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the platform. So, now there are 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Therefore, the number of books is still 7, and the number of action figures is now 10 - 3 = 7.
Response:  At first, there were two birds sitting on the fence (2). Then, three more birds joined them (3 + 2 = 5). So, now there are five birds in total sitting on the fence.
"Response:  At first, there were some birds sitting on the fence. Then, four more birds joined them. So, in total, how many birds were initially sitting on the fence? We can call this number ""x"". Now we know that x + 4 = 5, because there are now five birds in total at the fence. Solving for x, we get x = 1. Therefore, there were one bird originally sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 owls and 46 sparrows sitting on the fence. If 6 more owls joined them, then the total number of birds on the fence is:  Owls = 4 + 6 = 10 Sparrows = 46 + 6 = 52 Therefore, there are 10 owls and 52 sparrows on the fence in total.
Response:  We have 3 owls and 2 crows sitting at the fence. Then, 5 more birds join them. So, in total we have: 3 + 2 = 5 owls. And since there are no other types of birds mentioned, all these birds are either owls or crows. Therefore, the final number of owls and crows is: 5 owls + 2 crows = 7 birds.
Response:  We have 3 owls and 4 crows at first. Then, two more owls join them, so we have 5 owls in total (3 + 2). Now, there are still 4 crows left. Therefore, the final number of birds inside the fence is 5 owls and 4 crows, or 9 birds in total.
Response:  We have 3 ocells (doves) and 6 cigonets (spiders). If 3 more ocells come, we will have 3 + 3 = 6 ocells in total. So, there are now 6 ocells for every 6 cigonets, or 1 ocellet per spider. Therefore, there are 6 / 6 = 1 cigonye (spider) for each ocell (dove).
"Response:  We know that initially there were 4 owls and 6 sparrows sitting on the fence. Then, two more sparrows joined them. So, in total, we have: 4 owls + 2 sparrows = 6 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 6 cigonettes (the Spanish word for ""sparrows"") at the fence."
"Response:  We have:

* 3 owls (ocells) already sitting on the fence.
* 4 crows (cigonetes) also sitting on the fence.
* 6 more crows join them (not including the original 4).

So, in total we have:

Owls = 3 + 6 = 9 ocells
Crows = 4 + 6 = 10 cigonetes

Therefore, there are 9 owls and 10 crows at the enclosure."
Response:  We have 6 owls and 3 crows sitting at the fence. Two more crows join them. How many birds are there in total now? So, we have 6 + 2 = 8 birds in total.
Response:  We have 4 owls and 3 crows sitting at the fence. If 6 more crows join them, then we will have:  Number of crows = 4 + (6 x 3) = 12 crows. So, there are 12 crows more than owls in the enclosure.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 ocells sitting at the fence. Then, 8 more birds and 4 more frogs came to join them. So, in total, we have:  Birds = 4 + 8 = 12 Ocells Frogs = 4 + 4 = 8 Total number of animals at the fence = Birds + Frogs = 12 + 8 = 20 Therefore, there are 20 animals (12 birds and 8 frogs) at the fence.
Response:  We have 2 ocells initially and then 5 more ocells come to join them. So, we have 7 ocells in total now. Then, 4 more cigonetes arrive, so there are 11 creatures (ocells + cigonetes) inside the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and six crickets initially. Then, two more birds come to join them, so now we have five birds (3 + 2). However, there are still six crickets present. Therefore, the final number of crickets plus birds is 5 + 6 = 11. So, there are eleven animals in total - five birds and six crickets - inside the fence.
Response:  We have 5 cigarettes and 3 eyes sitting at the fence. If 4 more birds join them, then we will have: 5 + 3 = 8 birds in total. So there are 8 birds plus the original 5 cigarette butts, which is a total of 13 birds inside the enclosure.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 cigarettes and 2 owls sitting on the fence. Then came 3 more owls. So, in total, we have: 6 + 2 = 8 birds (cigones) at the fence.
Response:  We know that there were initially three birds sitting on the fence. Then, six crows and two more birds joined them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 3 + (6 x 1) + 2 = 10. Therefore, there are ten birds and six crows at the fence.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:  Number of pages in the first chapter - Number of pages in the second chapter = 48 - 11 = 37 pages So, there are 37 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 37 pages. Now, let's find out how many pages the second chapter has. According to the question, the second chapter has 80 pages more than the first chapter. So, if the first chapter has x pages, then the second chapter will have x + 80 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is equal to: x + 80.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 60 pages and the book has 93 pages in total. So, if we divide the number of pages in the book by the number of chapters (which is equal to 2), we get: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 93 / 2 = 46.5 pages Now, since each chapter has 60 pages, the second chapter must have 46.5 pages. Therefore, the answer is 46.5 pages.
Response:  We know that the book has two chapters and each chapter has a certain number of pages. The second chapter has 36 pages, so we can assume that the first chapter also has an equal number of pages. Therefore, if the second chapter has 36 pages, then the first chapter must have 36/2 = 18 pages.  So, the first chapter has 18 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book. So, the total number of pages = Number of pages in first chapter + Number of pages in second chapter + Number of pages in third chapter.  Now, let's calculate each of these numbers:  Number of pages in first chapter = 66 pages  Number of pages in second chapter = 35 pages  Number of pages in third chapter = 24 pages  Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: Total number of pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages  So, the book has 125 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 91 pages. Secondly, we know that the second chapter has 23 pages. Thirdly, we know that the third chapter has 25 pages. Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of pages of the first and second chapters:  Number of pages of the first chapter - Number of pages of the second chapter = 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter by 68 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, so it contributes to the total number of pages as follows: Chapter 1 = 35 pages. Now let's consider the second chapter. Since it has 18 pages, we can calculate its contribution to the total number of pages as follows: Chapter 2 = 18 pages. Finally, let's look at the third chapter, which has 3 pages, and calculate its contribution to the total number of pages as follows: Chapter 3 = 3 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the contributions from each chapter: Total number of pages = Chapter 1 + Chapter 2 + Chapter 3 = 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages. So, the second chapter has more pages than the third chapter by 66 - 3 = 63 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first chapter has 53 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages of the third chapter from the number of pages of the first chapter, we get: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages, so...  Total number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter  Total number of pages = 31 x 61  Total number of pages = 1861 pages
Response:  The book has 2 chapters with 23 pages each. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  Pages per chapter = Number of pages in one chapter x Number of chapters Total number of pages = Pages per chapter x Number of chapters  In this case, we know that the first chapter has 10 pages, so the number of pages in the first chapter is: First chapter pages = 10 pages/Pages per chapter = 10 pages/2 = 5 pages  Therefore, the first chapter has 5 pages.
"Response:  We know that the book has 2 chapters and each chapter has 81 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

Chapter 1: 2 x 81 = 162 pages
Chapter 2: 2 x 81 = 162 pages (since it has the same number of pages as Chapter 1)
Total number of pages in the book: 162 + 162 = 324 pages
Therefore, the second chapter has 68 pages."
Response:  At dawn, 62 campers went fishing. In the afternoon, 39 campers went fishing. To find out how many more campers went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went fishing in the morning: 62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, there were 23 more campers who went fishing at dawn than in the afternoon.
Response:  At dawn, 52 campers went fishing. In the afternoon, 61 campers went fishing. To find out how many more campers went fishing in the afternoon than at dawn, we need to subtract the number of campers who went fishing at dawn from the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon: 61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, 9 more campers went fishing in the afternoon than at dawn.
Response:  If 15 camperols went to fish in the morning and some of them went again in the afternoon, then we can say that the number of camperols who went to fish in the afternoon is equal to the difference between the total number of camperols and the number of camperols who went in the morning. So, if a total of 32 camperols went to fish that day, then the number of camperols who went to fish in the afternoon must be:  Number of camperols who went to fish in the afternoon = Total number of camperols - Number of camperols who went to fish in the morning  Number of camperols who went to fish in the afternoon = 32 - 15  Number of camperols who went to fish in the afternoon = 17
"Response:  We know that some campers went fishing in the morning and 7 campers went fishing in the afternoon. So, we can write this information as follows:
Morning: Some campers (not necessarily 7) went fishing.
Afternoon: 7 campers went fishing.
We are also given that a total of 60 campers went fishing that day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = 60 - 7
Number of campers who went fishing in the morning = 53
Therefore, 53 campers went fishing in the morning."
Response:  We know that 36 campers went to sea in the morning, and 13 campers went to sea in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who went to sea during the day is: 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, the total number of campers who went to sea is 49.
Response:  We know that 44 campers went to sea in the morning, and we want to find out how many more went than in the afternoon. So, let's subtract the number of campers who went to sea in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went to sea in the morning:  Number of campers who went to sea in the morning - Number of campers who went to sea in the afternoon = 44 - 39 = 5 Therefore, there were 5 more campers who went to sea in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that 53 campers went to sea in the morning, 48 campers went to sea in the afternoon and 49 campers went to sea at night. So we have:

Morning: 53 + 48 = 101
Afternoon: 48
Night: 49
Now let's compare how many more campers went to sea in the morning than at night:
More campers went to sea in the morning than at night: 101 - 49 = 52
Therefore, there were 52 more campers who went to sea in the morning than at night."
"Response:  We know that 33 campers went to work in the morning and 34 campers went to work in the afternoon. So, we have:

Morning: 33 + 34 = 67
Afternoon: 34 - 33 = 1
Night: 10

So, there were more campers who went to work in the afternoon than at night. The difference between the number of campers who went to work in the afternoon and those who went to work at night is 10 - 3 = 7. Therefore, the answer is 7."
Response:  We know that 13 campers went to walk in the morning and 59 campers went to walk in the afternoon. So, in total, we have: 13 + 59 = 72 campers who went for a walk.
Response:  At dawn, 29 campers went to walk and at noon, 66 campers went to walk. So, in total, 29 + 66 = 95 campers went for a walk during the day. Now, let's compare how many more campers went to walk in the morning than in the afternoon: Morning (dawn): 29 campers Afternoon (noon): 66 campers Therefore, there are 66 - 29 = 37 more campers who went to walk in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went to walk in the morning and 26 campers went to swim in the afternoon. So, in total, we have: 41 + 26 = 67 campers who went for a walk or swam in the water. Therefore, the answer is 67.
Response:  We know that 43 campers went to the beach in the morning and some more campers went to the beach in the afternoon. So, we can say that x = 43 + (some number). Since there are only 46 campers in total, we must have x = 46. Therefore, the answer is 46.
Response:  If Rachel collected 4 poms from her tree and initially there were 7 poms, then after collecting the 4 poms, there are now 3 poms left on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are still 3 poms on the tree.
Response:  At first, there were 4 apples on the tree. Then, Rachel picked some apples and now there are 2 apples left on the tree. So, Rachel collected __________ apples.
Response:  Rachel collected 7 mature apples from her tree and now there are 5 apples left in the tree. If 3 of them are mature and the others are immature, then how many immature apples are left in the tree? So, the number of immature apples is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  At first, Rachel collected two mature apples from her tree, so there were 2 + 2 = 4 apples left on the tree. Then, the tree lost 3 immature apples, leaving 4 - 3 = 1 mature apple. Therefore, the tree had 1 mature apple when Rachel started collecting them.
Response:  Rachel collected 6 mature apples from her tree at first. So, the number of apples on the tree before she started collecting was 6 + 2 = 8.
Response:  Rachel collected 3 mature apples from her tree at first. So, the number of mature apples on the tree before she started collecting was 3.
Response:  At first, Rachel collected 7 apples from her tree. So, the tree had 7 apples initially. Then, two new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples on the tree now is 7 + 2 = 9 apples. Finally, the question states that there are still 6 apples left on the tree, so the initial number of apples was 9 - 6 = 3 apples.  Hence, the tree had 3 apples at the beginning.
Response:  At first, there were two apples in the tree. Then, Rachel picked four apples from the tree. So, after she picked them, there were two apples left in the tree. Now, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples in the tree now is two + three = five apples.
Response:  Rachel had 52 apples in total and collected two from one of her trees. So she has 52 - 2 = 50 apples left. Now, after collecting two more apples from that tree, it has 7 apples remaining. Therefore, the original number of apples the tree had was 7 + 50 = 57 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel has collected 8 apples from each of her three trees. So, she has collected a total of 8 x 3 = 24 apples. Now, we are told that after collecting these apples, the trees have a total of 9 apples left. Therefore, the initial number of apples in each tree was 9 - 8 = 1 apple.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has 4 apple trees and she collected 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, she collected 7 x 4 = 28 apples. But then it says ""Ara els arbres tenen un total de 29 pomes encara en ells"". This means that after Rachel collected her 28 apples, there are still 1 apple left on each of the 4 trees, which adds up to 4 x 1 = 4 apples remaining. Therefore, the final number of apples Rachel collected is 28 + 4 = 32 apples."
Response:  We know that Ed has 20 more hair than Doug. So if Doug had x hair initially, then Ed would have 2x hair. Now we are told that Doug lost some of his hair in the backyard. Let's assume he lost half of his initial hair, so he now has x/2 hair. Since Ed has 20 more hair than Doug, Ed now has 2(x/2) = 4x/2 hair. Therefore, Doug lost 3 hair (since 4x/2 - x/2 = 3).
"Response:  If Ed had 10 more hairs than Doug and Doug lost 11 hairs in the playground, then:
Ed = Doug + 10
Doug = Ed - 11
Now we know that Ed has 45 hairs and Doug has x hairs. So, we can write an equation:
Ed = 45
Doug = x - 11
We want to find out how many hairs Doug had before he lost any, so we solve for x:
x = Doug = 34
So, Doug had 34 hairs before he lost any."
Response:  If Ed had 6 more hair than Doug and lost 3 of them in the playground, then he has 9 - 3 = 6 fewer hair now. So, if Doug had 22 hair initially, then Ed has 22 - 6 = 16 less hair now. Therefore, Doug has 22 + 7 = 39 hair left.
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 27 marbles in total, then Doug must have had 22 marbles initially (since Ed had 5 more). Therefore, Doug lost 3 marbles from his initial amount of 22, leaving him with 19 marbles at the end.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more hair than Doug initially. So, if Doug had x hair, then Ed had x + 24 = 30 hair. Now, we are told that Doug lost 27 hair in the game yard while Ed found 9 more hair. Therefore, the difference between the number of hair Ed and Doug had after losing/finding hair is:  Ed gained 9 - Doug lost 27 = 18 hair. So, Ed had 18 more hair than Doug after they both played the game.
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug. If Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, then Ed had 29 + 17 = 46 marbles more than Doug. So, Ed had 46 - 17 = 29 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more hair than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 27 hair and Doug had 9 hair, then Ed lost 6 hair (since he has fewer hair now). Therefore, Ed lost 6 hair.
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more hairs than Doug. So, if Doug had 60 hairs, then Ed had 90 hairs (30 + 60 = 90). Now, we are told that Ed lost 21 of his hairs in the backyard. So, after losing those hairs, Ed had 90 - 21 = 69 hairs left. Therefore, En Doug had 69 + 60 = 129 hairs.
"Response:  If Ed had 12 more hairs than Doug and he lost 20 of them in the playground, then:

Ed = Doug + 12 - 20 = Doug + 3
So, Doug has 17 pepples (pebbles) now."
Response:  If 408 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we can say that the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested bacon by a margin of 408 - 42 = 366. Therefore, more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon.
Response:  If 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we can say that there are more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. We cannot determine exactly how many more students suggested bacon without additional information.
Response:  We know that 310 students were asked to suggest specific types of food for the menu change.  Of those, 185 suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon. So, we can say that 185 + x = 310, where x is the number of students who suggested bacon. Solving for x, we get x = 125. Therefore, 125 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  We know that 264 students suggested adding tofu and other students suggested adding mashed potatoes. So, we can say that 264 + x = total number of students who suggested mashed potatoes, where x is the number of students who did not suggest tofu. Therefore, x = 288 - 264 = 144. So, 144 students suggested mashed potatoes.
Response:  If 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 additional students suggested it as well, then the total number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is: 457 + 63 = 520. Therefore, 520 students suggested mashed potatoes.
Response:  If 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 166 students suggested adding bacon, then there are total of 348 students who gave suggestions. So, if we subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the total number of students, we get: Number of students who suggested bacon = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 348 - 182 = 166 Therefore, 166 students suggested adding bacon.
Response:  We know that 324 students suggested adding potato puree and 374 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, we can say that 698 students participated in suggesting new food items (324 + 374). Finally, we are told that only 128 students suggested adding tomatoes. So, the total number of students who participated in the suggestion process is 698 + 128 = 826 students.
Response:  We know that out of 257 students who suggested food items for the menu, 120 students suggested adding bacon. So, B = 120. Now, we need to find out how many students suggested adding potatoes. According to the question, 120 students suggested bacon and 97 students suggested adding tomatoes, so C = 97. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding more purée than bacon is: D = C - B = 97 - 120 = 37.
"Response:  We know that 144 students suggested adding potato puree and 79 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu. So, we can write this as an equation: 

144 + 79 = x

Where ""x"" represents the number of students who suggested adding bacon to the menu. Since 467 students suggested adding bacon, we can substitute this value into our equation: 

144 + 79 = 467

Solving for ""x"", we get: 

x = 386

So, more than three times as many students (386) suggested adding potato puree than suggested adding tomatoes."
Response:  We know that out of 228 students who suggested food items, 337 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. So, we can write this as: Bacon - 337. Now, let's find out how many students suggested adding tomatoes. According to the question, only 23 students suggested adding tomatoes. Therefore, we can write this as: Tomatoes - 23. Finally, we want to know how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the total number of students who suggested bacon: Bacon minus Tomatoes = 337 - 23 = 314. So, there were 314 more students who suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes.
Response:  We know that 450 students participated in the survey and they were asked to suggest specific types of food for the cafeteria menu. From the given information, we can conclude that: • 38 students suggested adding bacon to the menu (Question 1). So, there are 412 students who did not suggest adding bacon (450 - 38 = 412). • Since Sofia asked the students to suggest 66 different types of food, and each student could suggest only one type, then the number of suggestions made by all 412 non-bacon suggesting students is equal to 66 / 412 = 0.157 (or approximately 16) times the total number of students. Therefore, the number of suggestions made by these students is 0.157 x 412 = 63 (approximately).
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potato puree and only 351 students suggested adding just tofu, then we can say that 218 - 351 = 133 students did not suggest adding any new food item. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding tofu is 351 - 133 = 218 students.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding bacon and 330 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, then there are more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon. So, we can say that $ \text {number of students who suggested mashed potatoes} > \text{ number of students who suggested bacon} $.  Now, let's find out exactly how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon. We know that 330 students suggested mashed potatoes and 269 students suggested bacon. Therefore, the difference between these two numbers is equal to 330 - 269 = 61. So, there are 61 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than bacon.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 569 - 236 = 333 Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls:  Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.67 So, there are approximately 26 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school. Of those, 232 are girls and the rest are boys. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get the number of boys. Therefore, the number of boys at the school is:  Boys = Total students - Girls = 485 - 232 = 253  So, there are 253 boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in total and 228 more girls than boys. So, if we divide the number of girls by the number of boys, we get: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 697 - 228 = 469 Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 635 + (510 - 635) = 485 Therefore, there are 485 boys in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys, then the total number of students in the school is:  Number of girls = 868 + (281 - 28) = 897 Number of boys = 868 - 28 = 840 Total number of students = 897 + 840 = 1737 Therefore, there are 1737 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in the school and 142 more boys than girls. So, if we add this number to the total number of girls, we get:  Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys (more than girls) = 700 + 142 = 842  Therefore, there are 842 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, there were 706 girls and 222 boys in the school initially. Then, 418 more girls joined the school, making the total number of girls 1124 (706 + 418). So, the total number of students in the school now is 1124 + 222 = 1346. Therefore, there are 1346 students in the school now.
Response:  Firstly, there are 902 girls in the school initially. Then, 44 more girls join the school, making it total number of girls to be 902 + 44 = 946 girls. So, there are 946 girls in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, the total number of girls now is: 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Now, we need to find out how many boys are left in the school. The initial number of boys was 410, so after the new students joined, the total number of boys is: 410 - (number of boys who left or didn't join) =???. Since we don't have any information about the number of boys who left or didn't join, let's assume that they all stayed in the school. Therefore, the final number of boys in the school is: 410 + 465 = 875 boys. So, the ratio of girls to boys in the school is: 1097 girls / 875 boys = 1.25 : 1.
Response:  Firstly, there were 732 girls in the school initially. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school right now.
Response:  Firstly, there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially. Then, 496 more girls and 910 more boys join the school, making the total number of girls 631 (496 + 135) and the total number of boys 1124 (214 + 910). Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in the school overall. There are 36 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is 626 (students) + 36 (teachers) = 662. Therefore, there are 662 people in this school.
Response:  Noies = 315 and Noys = 309. Total number of students = Noyes + Noys = 315 + 309 = 624. Now we have to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in total at school. Number of teachers = 772. So, total number of people at school = Students + Teachers = 624 + 772 = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 people at the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are 402 girls and 739 girls, then there must be fewer boys. Let's assume that there are x boys in the school. Since we want to find out how many boys there are, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem: Number of girls = 402 Number of boys + Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Therefore, we have: 402 = x + (739 - 402) Subtracting 402 from both sides gives us: x = 337 Now, since there are more girls than boys in the school, we know that x is greater than 0. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 337.
Response:  If there are 458 more girls than boys in the school, then the total number of students is equal to the number of girls plus the number of boys. So we can write: Number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys  Now, if there are 692 girls in the school, and there are 458 more girls than boys, then the number of boys must be equal to half of the difference between the total number of students and the number of girls. Therefore, we can write: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of boys = 1370 - 692 = 678  So, there are 678 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. Then, 403 more girls joined the school. So, now the total number of girls is 403 + 257 = 660. Therefore, the ratio of boys to girls in the school is: Number of boys / Total number of students = 362/919 = 0.39 (or 39%)
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward has $2 now.
Response:  If Edward had $13 and spent some money, he now has $3. So, we can say that the amount of money he spent is equal to the difference between his original amount of money ($13) and his current amount of money ($3). Therefore, the answer is: $10 (the difference between $13 and $3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edwatd spent $9 initially. Then he spent $8 more after that, so in total he spent $9 + $8 = $17. Now, to find out how much Edward had before spending the money, we can divide the amount he spent ($17) by 2, since he spent half of his initial amount: $17 / 2 = $8. Therefore, Edward had $8 before spending any money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy books and each book cost him the same amount of money. So he had $16 / $x = 92 dollars before spending it. Now we have x - $6 = 6 dollars left with him after spending the money. Therefore, his initial balance was $x = 64 dollars.
Response:  If Edward spent 6 dollars and now has 12 dollars, that means he had twice as much money after buying the books. So, if he spent 6 dollars on each book, then each book cost him half of his initial amount, which is 3 dollars. Therefore, each book costs 3 dollars.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had x dollars. He spent 6$ on books and 16$ on pens, so he spent a total of 22$. Now he has 19$, which means that his original amount was greater than or equal to 19$. So, we can write an inequality: x >= 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 20. Therefore, Edward had 20 dollars before spending any money.
Response:  Edward spent 4 dollars on books and 3 dollars on pens. So he has 4 + 3 = 7 dollars left after buying those things. Therefore, Edward spent 7 - 12 = -5 dollars on books and pens.
Response:  If Edward spent 16 dollars in books and 8 dollars in pens, then he has 19 dollars left after buying both. So, we can write an equation as follows: Book cost = 16 Dollar Pens cost = 8 Dollars Total cost = 24 Dollars Now, let's solve for the amount that Edward spent on books: Books cost = Total cost - Pens cost Books cost = 24 - 8 Books cost = 16 Therefore, Edward spent more money on books than on pens. The difference between the two amounts is 16-8=8 dollars.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $17. He spent $17 and received $10 from his friend. So now he has $27 - $10 = $17. Therefore, Edward had $17 before spending any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 flexions in class today and David did more than Zachary. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Flexions done by Zachary = 44  Flexions done by David = x (since David did more than Zachary)  Now, we are asked to find out how many flexions did Zachary and David make in total. To do this, we need to add the number of flexions done by each of them: Total flexions done by Zachary = 44 + Total flexions done by David =?  Substituting the value given in the question, we get: Total flexions done by Zachary = 44 + 58 = 102  Therefore, Zachary and David together made 102 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has made 51 flexions and David has made 44 flexions in class. So we can write this as an equation: 51 = x - 44 where x is the number of flexions made by David. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 44 from both sides of the equation: 51 - 44 = x Solving for x gives us: x = 7 Therefore, David made 7 more flexions than Zachary.
Response:  We know that David made 44 flexions in class today and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary made x flexions, then we can write an equation as follows:  David made 44 + 9 = x flexions. Simplifying the equation, we get: 35 = x. Therefore, Zachary made 35 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that David made 51 flexions in class today and he did 49 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary made x flexions, then David made 51 - 49 = 2 flexions more than Zachary. In other words, David made x + 2 flexions in total. Therefore, the answer is x = 47.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 59 flexions and David has done 19 more than Zachary. So, David has done 59 + 19 = 78 flexions.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 flexions and 17 agachadas in class today. Then we are told that David did 29 more flexions than Zachary, which means he did 65 flexions (44 + 29 = 65). However, we also know that David did 13 fewer agachadas than Zachary, so he did 30 agachadas (17 - 13 = 30). Therefore, David did 65 flexions and 30 agachadas in total.
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 flexions and 14 agafades in class today. David has also done some flexions and agafades, but he did 10 fewer than Zachary. So, if David did x flexions and y agafades, we can write an equation as follows:

Zachary did 53 flexions + 14 agafades = total number of flexions and agafades done in class today
David did x flexions - 10 = total number of flexions and agafades done in class today (since he did 10 fewer)
Now, we need to solve for x and y. Since Zachary did 53 flexions, we can set up the following equation:
x + 10 = 53
Solving for x, we get:
x = 43
So, David did 43 flexions and 14 agafades in class today."
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 35 flexions and 3 agachadas in class today.  David did 58 more flexions than Zachary, but he also did 87 fewer flexions than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x flexions, then David did x + 58 = 145 flexions. Therefore, Zachary did 145 - 87 = 58 more flexions than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 46 flexions and 58 agarades in class today. David did 38 more flexions than Zachary, which means he did 46 + 38 = 84 flexions. However, David did 62 fewer agarades than Zachary, which means he did 58 - 62 = -4 agarades. So, Zachary did 58 agarades more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 flexions in class today. Then we are told that David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 39 + 19 = 58 flexions. Next, we learn that John did 13 fewer flexions than David, so John did 58 - 13 = 45 flexions. Therefore, David did 58 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 flexions in class today. Then we are told that David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 flexions (51 + 22 = 73). Next, we learn that John did 4 fewer flexions than David, so John did 69 flexions (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John did 69 flexions today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 flexions in class today. David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 54 flexions (39 + 15). John did 9 fewer than David, so John did 45 flexions (54 - 9 = 45). Therefore, Zachary did 45 - 9 = 36 more flexions than John.
Response:  We know that David did 30 more flexes than Zachary. So if Zachary did x flexes, then David did 30 + x flexes. And we also know that David did 37 flexes in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 37 = 30 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So Zachary did 7 flexes in class today.
Response:  We know that David made more than Zachary in class today. So if David did 56 push-ups and Zachary did x, then we can say that Zachary did less than 56 - x push-ups. Now, we are told that David did 38 push-ups, so we can write an equation as follows: 56 - x = 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. Therefore, Zachary did 18 push-ups in class today.
Response:  We know that David has done 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer pull-ups than Zachary in class. So if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 pull-ups, then David did 34 + 40 = 74 push-ups and 62 - 17 = 45 pull-ups.
Response:  We know that David made 36 more flexions than Zachary and 33 less agility exercises than Zachary. So if Zachary did 58 flexions and 33 agility exercises, then David did 58 - 33 = 25 flexions and 33 + 25 = 58 agility exercises. Therefore, Zachary did 13 more flexions and 25 fewer agility exercises than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 5 flexions and 17 agarades in class today. If David did 27 more flexions than Zachary, then David did 27 + 5 = 32 flexions in total. However, we also know that David did 7 fewer agarades than Zachary, so David did 17 - 7 = 10 agarades in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of flexions and agarades that Zachary did is 32 - 10 = 22.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math and 2 pages of reading, then we can say that: Math pages = 5 Reading pages = 2 So, the number of math pages is 5 more than the number of reading pages. Therefore, the answer is 5 + 2 = 7
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 3 pages of math and 4 pages of reading, then she has more pages of reading than of math. So, we can say that:
pages of reading = 4 - 3 = 1
Therefore, Rachel has 1 page more of reading than of math."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math and more pages of reading for her homework. So, if she had to complete a total of 7 pages of the task at home, then we can say that she had to complete x pages of reading for her homework. Since we are given that she completed 5 pages of math, we can set up the equation as follows:  x = 7 - 5  Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:  x = 2  Therefore, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading for her homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math and she wanted to do 4 more pages of math than reading. So, if she completed x pages of reading, then she would have done 7 + 4 = 11 pages in total. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 11 - x pages of reading.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math and she has to complete 3 more pages of math than reading, then...
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math problems and she also had to do 6 more pages of reading than math problems. So, if she did 8 pages of math problems, then she would have done 14 pages (8 + 6) of total work. Therefore, she would have to do an additional 2 pages of reading to reach her goal of 16 pages in total.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 pages of math work and she also has to complete 3 more pages of reading than of math, then we can say that the total number of pages she needs to complete is: Total pages = Math pages + Reading pages - Math pages That means: Total pages = 10 + 3 - 10 = 23 pages So, Rachel needs to complete 23 pages in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math and 3 pages of reading. Each page of math has 4 problems, so she had to solve 8 problems in total (2 x 4 = 8). Similarly, each page of reading has 5 questions, so she had to read and answer 15 questions in total (3 x 5 = 15). Now let's add up all these numbers: 8 + 15 = 23. So, Rachel had to complete 23 pages in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math and 2 pages of reading. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more pages she had to do in math than in reading. To do this, we can subtract the number of pages she had to read from the total number of pages she had to complete in math.  Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she had to do in math and reading is:  Math pages - Reading pages = 9 - 2 = 7 pages.  So, Rachel had 7 more pages of math than of reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math and 2 pages of reading. So far, she has completed 11 + 2 = 13 pages. Now we are asked how many more pages of mathematics than of biology Rachel had to complete. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of pages of biology from the total number of pages of mathematics. In this case, there were 3 pages of biology left to be completed, so we have: 13 - 3 = 10 pages more of mathematics than of biology.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math, 11 pages of reading, and 8 pages of biology. So, in total she had to complete 7 + 11 = 18 pages. Now we are asked how many more pages of reading than of biology Rachel had to do. To find this out, we subtract the number of pages of biology from the number of pages of reading: 18 - 8 = 10 pages. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 10 more pages of reading than of biology.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math and 11 pages of reading. So far so good! But then we are told she also had to complete 29 pages of biology. That means she has to do 29 - 11 = 18 more pages of reading than she did in math. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 9 + 18 = 27 pages of reading in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math and 3 pages of biology. So, in total she needs to complete 8 + 3 = 11 pages.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math and 10 pages of reading. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many pages she needs to complete in biology. Since it says ""and 6 pàgines de biologia"", we can assume that Rachel needs to complete 6 pages of biology as well. Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel needs to complete is: 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading and 4 pages of mathematics. So, we can write an equation as follows: Reading = 2 Mathematics = 4 Now, let's solve for the number of pages of mathematics that Rachel had to complete more than the number of pages of reading she did. To do this, subtract the number of pages of reading from the number of pages of mathematics: Mathematics - Reading = 4 - 2 = 2 Therefore, Rachel had to complete 2 more pages of mathematics than she did of reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading from task 7 and 19 pages more from task 8. So, in total she had to complete 23 pages (4 + 19). Now we need to find out how many pages of mathematics Rachel had to complete. According to the question, she had to complete 1 page less than the number of pages of reading she had to do. Therefore, the number of pages of mathematics Rachel had to complete is equal to 23 - 1 = 22 pages.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received six messages in the morning and two in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Morning messages = 6
Evening messages = 2

Now, let's solve for the number of messages Jack received in the morning compared to the number he received in the evening:

Number of morning messages / Number of evening messages =?

Solving for the fraction, we get:

6 / 2 = 3

So, Jack received three more messages in the morning than he did in the evening."
"Response:  If Jack received 6 messages in the morning and 8 messages in the evening, then he received a total of:

6 + 8 = 14 messages

Therefore, Jack received more emails in the evening than in the morning."
Response:  If Jack received four messages in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he must have received at least one message in the afternoon. So, let x be the number of messages Jack received in the afternoon. Since there are five messages in total that Jack received during the day, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 5. Now, solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method to find out how many messages Jack received in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 messages in the morning, 3 in the middle of the day and 5 in the evening. So, we can write an equation:

Morning = 6 messages
Middle of the day = 3 messages
Evening = 5 messages

Now, let's convert these equations into numerical values:

Morning = 6 x 1 (since it is the first time)
Middle of the day = 3 x 2 (since he received 2 more messages after the first one)
Evening = 5 x 3 (since he received 3 more messages after the second one)

So, Jack received a total of 6 + 6 + 5 = 17 emails per day."
Response:  At 8 am, Jack received 5 messages. So at this time, he had already received 5 + 0 = 5 messages.  At noon (12 pm), Jack received another 8 messages, so now he has received a total of 5 + 8 = 13 messages.  Finally, at sunset (5 pm), Jack received 72 more messages, bringing his total to 13 + 72 = 85 messages. Therefore, Jack received 85 emails in total during the daytime hours (from 8 am to sunset).
Response:  At morning, Jack received 4 messages.  In the middle of the day (12 pm), he received no new messages since it was already 5 am when he last checked his inbox.  Therefore, at midday, Jack had 4 messages in his inbox.  At 5 pm, he received another 3 messages, so now he has 7 messages in total.  Finally, at evening and night, Jack did not receive any new messages, so he still has 7 messages in his inbox.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 messages in the morning and 8 in the evening. So, he received a total of 11 messages (3 + 8 = 11).
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 messages in the morning and 7 in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Morning = 10 + 7 = 17
Afternoon = 7

Now, let's solve for ""More emails in the morning than in the afternoon"":

Morning - Afternoon = 17 - 7 = 10

Therefore, Jack received more e-mails in the morning (10) than in the afternoon (7)."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 9 messages in the morning and 7 in the evening. So, we can write an equation:

Morning = 9 (Jack received 9 messages)
Evening = 7 (Jack received 7 messages)

Now, let's compare the number of messages he received in the morning to the number of messages he received in the evening:

Number of messages in the morning - Number of messages in the evening =?

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more messages in the morning than in the evening."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 messages in the morning, 5 in the afternoon and 4 at night. So, we can write down the information as follows:

Morning (10): x = 10
Afternoon (5): y = 5
Night (4): z = 4

Now, we need to find out how many more emails Jack received at lunchtime than he did at night. To do this, we subtract the number of emails he received at night from the number of emails he received at lunchtime:

Number of emails at lunchtime - Number of emails at night =?

Substituting the values we have obtained earlier, we get:

y - z =?

Solving for y, we get:

y = 9

Therefore, Jack received 9 more emails at lunchtime than he did at night."
Response:  If Jack received 6 messages in the morning, and then he received 3 more messages at midday, that means he received a total of 9 messages between the morning and midday (6 + 3 = 9). So, if he received a total of 10 messages during the day, then he must have received 1 message in the afternoon (10 - 9 = 1). Therefore, Jack received 1 message in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters, so he received a total of 67 messages (3 emails + 64 letters).  Later in the day, Jack received 5 more emails and 54 letters, for a total of 71 messages (67 + 5 + 54) that he received that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 71 / 2 = 35.5 emails per day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 messages and 6 cards, so he received a total of 11 pieces of mail (messages + cards).  Later in the day, Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters, for a total of 16 pieces of mail that day. Therefore, Jack received 16 - 11 = 5 additional pieces of mail that day.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 10 messages and 12 cards. So, he received a total of 22 communications at morning.  In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 cards. Therefore, he received a total of 47 communications in the afternoon.  Comparing the number of communications received in the morning to those received in the afternoon, we can see that Jack received more communications in the afternoon than in the morning (47 - 22 = 25).  So, Jack received 25 more e-mails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 letters and 8 emails. So, in total he received 6 + 8 = 14 messages at morning.  In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters. So, in total he received 2 + 7 = 9 messages at afternoon.  Therefore, Jack received more letters at morning than at afternoon. The difference between these two amounts is 14 - 9 = 5 letters.  Hence, Jack received 5 additional letters at morning compared to the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 messages and sent 91 letters in the morning. So, he received 91 - 6 = 85 messages per day. Then, we are told that after receiving these messages, he received 2 emails and sent 74 letters in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received 2 emails per day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack sent 2 letters and received 4 messages. So he sent 2/5 of the total number of messages that day (i.e., 4). Therefore, Jack sent 8 messages in the afternoon (since he received 6 emails).  Thus, Jack sent 8 + 2 = 10 emails per day.
Response:  If Jack received 7 messages in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 + x messages in the afternoon, where x is the number of messages he received after noon. Since there are 12 hours in a day, we can write an equation as follows:  7 + x = 9 (total messages)  Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:  x = 2 (number of messages received in the afternoon)
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 messages in the afternoon and 16 at night. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Morning = 5 (messages received)
Afternoon = 3 (messages received)
Night = 16 (messages received)

Now, let's compare the number of messages received during each time period:

Morning: 5
Afternoon: 3
Night: 16

So, Jack received more messages at night than he did during either the morning or afternoon. Therefore, the answer is:

More messages were received at night than during any other time period."
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 messages in the afternoon and 6 messages in the morning, so he received a total of 9 messages during the day. Therefore, he received 9 - 3 = 6 messages in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog is 12 inches more than the distance traveled by the jumping bean. So if the bee jumped 9 inches, then the frog jumped 12 + 9 = 21 inches. Therefore, the distance between the frog and the starting point of the jump is 21 inches.
Response:  The rabbit jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches. In total, they have jumped 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The saltarroca jumped 36 inches (or 91 cm).  The frog jumped 17 inches more than the saltarroca, so it jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches (or 134 cm).  The rat jumped 15 inches more than the frog, so it jumped 53 + 15 = 68 inches (or 172 cm). Therefore, the frog jumped 68 inches beyond its initial position.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the saltarroca (El Salt) jumped 25 inches. Then, we are told that the frog (La Granota) jumped 18 inches more than the saltarroca, so it jumped 25 + 18 = 43 inches. Finally, we are informed that the mouse (El Ratolí) jumped 2 inches more than the frog, so it jumped 43 + 2 = 45 inches. Therefore, the ratolí jumped 45 inches in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the ratolí has to be more than 20 polzades beyond the saltell. So, let's assume that the distance between the ratolí and the saltell is x polzades. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Distance = x + 20 (since the ratolí is 20 polzades beyond the saltell) Now, we are also told that the granota has jumped 10 polzades more than the saltell. So, if the saltell jumped 19 polzades, then the granota jumped 19 + 10 = 29 polzades. Therefore, the total distance from the saltell to the ratolí plus the distance from the ratolí to the granota is equal to the sum of their individual jumps: Distance = x + 20 + 29 =? We can simplify this equation as follows: Distance = 59 polzades. So, the ratolí has jumped 59 polzades beyond the saltell.
"Response:  We know that:
El saltarroca (S) = 19 inches (polzades)
La granota (G) = 39 + X inches (polzades), where X is the distance beyond Saltarroca
Ratolí (R) = 94 - Y inches (polzades), where Y is the distance below Granota
We are also given that Granota has salted more than Saltarroca. So, we can write an inequality based on this information:
G > S
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 39 - S
Substituting this value in the equation for R:
R = 94 - (39 - S)
Simplifying and solving for S:
S = 50
So, Granota has salted 50 inches beyond Saltarroca."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 25 inches and the mouse jumped x inches less than the frog. So, we can write an equation:  Distance = 25 + (x - 25)  Now, we are told that the garden jumped 32 inches more than the frog. So, we can add 32 to both sides of the equation:  Distance = 25 + (x - 25) + 32  Simplifying the equation:  Distance = 57 + x  Substituting the value given in the question for x:  Distance = 57 + (-26)  Distance = 81  Therefore, the mouse jumped 81 inches.
Response:  We know that the saltarroca (El Saltarello) jumped 24 inches. The frog (La Granota) jumped 33 inches more than the saltarroco and the mouse (El Ratolí) jumped 5 inches less than the frog. So, if we want to find out how far the mouse jumped, we can use the following equation: Distance = Frog's distance + Mouse's difference. In this case, the frog jumped 33 inches more than the saltarroco, so the mouse jumped: Distance = 24 inches + (-5 inches) = 19 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 19 inches away from the saltarroco.
Response:  The jumping rope (el saltoroll) jumps 13 inches and then the little one (el saltell) jumps 5 cm more than that, which is equal to 5 + 0 = 5 inches. So, the distance traveled by the farm (la granja) is 13 + 5 = 18 inches.
Response:  The first jump was made by Saltorolli and he jumped 35 inches. Then, Granja also jumped, but she jumped 4 inches more than Saltorolli. So, in total, they have jumped 39 inches (35 + 4).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that El Saltirroca (the frog) jumped 19 inches. Then, we are told that El Ratolí (the mouse) jumped 15 cm less than La Granota (the toad). So, if La Granota jumped x cm, then El Ratolí jumped x - 15 cm. Now, we are also given that El Saltirroca jumped 10 cm more than La Granota. Therefore, we can write an equation:

x + 10 = 19... (1)

Substituting the value of x from the second part of the problem, we get:

x + 10 = 19
x = 8

So, La Granota jumped 8 cm."
Response:  The saltwater crocodile jumped 39 inches (or 99 cm).  The frog jumped 19 inches more than that, so it jumped 58 inches (or 147 cm).  And the mouse jumped 12 inches less than that, so it jumped 46 inches (or 117 cm). Therefore, the mouse jumped 46 inches beyond the farm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the starting point and where the frog jumped is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the frog (21 feet) plus the distance traveled by the mouse (16 feet). So, the total distance = 21 + 16 = 37 feet. Now, since the rat has jumped beyond the farm, we can say that the distance from the farm to where the rat jumped is equal to the remaining distance after subtracting the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, the distance from the farm to where the rat jumped = 37 - 21 = 16 feet. So, the rat jumped 16 feet away from the farm.
Response:  We know that the farm jumped 39 inches and the frog jumped 17 inches. So, if we subtract the distance traveled by the farm from the total distance traveled by both of them, we get: Distance = Total distance - Farm distance = 17 + 39 = 56 inches. Therefore, the distance between the farm and the frog is 56 inches or 4 feet 8 inches (since there are 12 inches in one foot).
Response:  We know that the ratolí has to jump less than the granota because it is smaller than her. So, if the granota jumps 15 cm more than the saltarell (which jumped 10 cm less than her), then the ratolí will have to jump 5 cm less than the granota. Therefore, the ratolí will jump 10 cm.
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the frog is 37 - 16 = 21 inches more than the distance traveled by the mouse. So, if the mouse traveled x inches, then the frog traveled x + 21 inches. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 21 = 37
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
So, the mouse traveled 16 inches less than the frog."
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 5 tasses of farina and she needs to add 9 more tasses (since the recipe requires 14 - 5 = 9 tasses). So, we need to find out how many tasses of sugar La Mary should add. Since the recipe requires 6 tasses of sugar, and La Mary has already added 3 tasses of sugar (since each tasse of farina used is equal to 2 tasses of sugar), La Mary now needs to add an additional 3 tasses of sugar. Therefore, the final answer is:  La Mary needs to add 9 tasses of farina and 3 tasses of sugar, for a total of 12 tasses of ingredients.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 4 tasses of flour and she needs to add 5 more tasses of flour to make the recipe complete. So, we need to find out how many tasses of sugar she should add. According to the question, the recipe requires 11 tasses of sugar for every 9 tasses of flour. Therefore, if La Mary adds 5 more tasses of flour, she will also need to add 5/9 x 11 = 6 tasses of sugar. So, La Mary needs to add 6 tasses of sugar now.
"Response:  We know that La Mary needs 6 tasses of flour and 13 tasses of sugar for her recipe. She has already added some flour, but we don't know how much. To find out how many more tasses she needs to add, we can divide the amount of sugar needed (13 tasses) by the amount of flour she has already added (let's call it x). So, we have:

Number of tasses of flour needed = 13 - x

Since La Mary needs 8 more tasses of flour than she needs of sugar, we can set up the equation:

Number of tasses of flour needed = 13 - x = 8 + x

Now we solve for x:

x = 5

So, La Mary needs to add 5 more tasses of flour to complete her recipe."
"Response:  If La Mary has already put X tasses of flour (where X is some number), and the recipe requires 11 tasses of flour in total, then we can write an equation as follows:

X + 4 = 11... (1)

Now, if the recipe also requires 7 tasses of sugar, and La Mary has already used X tasses of flour, then we can write another equation as follows:

X + 4 = 7... (2)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

X = 6

So, La Mary needs to use 2 more tasses of flour than she has already used."
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 3 tasses of farina to prepare the cake. So, we have: Farina used = 3 tasses. Now, the recipe requires 9 more tasses of farina. Therefore, the total amount of farina required is: Total farina needed = 9 tasses - 3 tasses = 6 tasses.
"Response:  If La Mary has already put X tasses of flour (where X is some number), and the recipe requires 12 tasses of flour in total, then we can write an equation as follows:

X + 7 = 12... (1)

Now, if La Mary still needs to use 2 more tasses of flour, we can substitute this value into Equation (1):

X + 7 = 12
X + 7 - 2 = 12
X = 9

So, La Mary has put 9 tasses of flour so far."
Response:  We know that we have to add 4 tasses of flour (since the recipe requires 9 tasses and we have already added 3). So, we need to add 4 more tasses of flour. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 tasses of sugar and Mary has already added 2 tasses of sugar. So we need to find out how many more tasses of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (14) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2). This gives us the number of additional tasses of sugar needed: 14 - 2 = 12 tasses. Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more tasses of sugar.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 11 tasses of flour and the recipe requires 12 tasses in total. So we need to find out how many more tasses she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (12 - 11 = 1) by the amount of flour needed per task (1 tasse). Therefore, La Mary needs to add 1 more tasse of flour.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 7 tasses of farina and she needs to add 3 more tasses of farina to make the recipe complete. So, we need to find out how many tasses of farina are left to be added.  Number of tasses of farina remaining = Total amount of farina required - Amount of farina already added = 10 tasses - 7 tasses = 3 tasses. Therefore, La Mary needs to add 3 more tasses of farina to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that La Mary has already added two tablespoons of flour (or 2/5 of a cup). To find out how many more tablespoons she needs to add, we can use the following proportion:

Farina : Sugar :: 3 : 4

So, if La Mary has already added 2/5 of a cup of flour, then she needs to add 3/5 of a cup more. This is equal to 6 tablespoons or 3/4 of a cup.

Therefore, La Mary needs to add 6 tablespoons of flour more to make the pastis."
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 5 tasses of farina and she needs to add 3 more tasses (since the recipe requires 6 tasses in total). Now, we need to find out how much sucre and salt are required. Since the recipe states that for every 2 tasses of flour, you need 1 tassa of sugar and salt, we can calculate the amount of sugar and salt needed as follows: Sugar = Total amount of sugar / Number of tasses of flour remaining Salt = Total amount of salt / Number of tasses of flour remaining Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Sugar = 8 - 5 = 3 tasses Salt = 7 - 5 = 2 tasses Therefore, La Mary needs to add 3 tasses of sugar and 2 tasses of salt to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that La Mary needs 13 tasses of sugar for her recipe and she has already added 2 tasses of sugar so far. So, we need to find out how many more tasses of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (13) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2): 13 / 2 = 6.5 tasses of sugar left to be added. Therefore, La Mary needs to add 6.5 tasses of sugar more to complete her recipe.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 4 tasses of sugar and she needs to add 5 more tasses (since the recipe requires 6 tasses). So, we need to find out how many tasses of flour she should add. To do this, we can divide the amount of flour required in the recipe (9 tasses) by the amount of sugar she has already added (4 tasses): 9 / 4 = 2.25 tasses. Since you cannot have a fraction of a tasse, we must round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 tasses. Therefore, La Mary should add 3 more tasses of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 2 tasses of farina (2/10 = 0.2). Now we need to find out how many tasses of farina she needs to add more. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total amount of farina needed = Amount of farina already added + Farina required per unit of sugar To find the total amount of farina needed, we need to multiply the number of tasses of sugar by the amount of farina required per tasse of sugar. Since each tasse of sugar requires 3 tasses of farina, we can write: Total amount of farina needed = 6 tasses x 3 tasses/tasse = 18 tasses Of course, this is just an estimate since we don't have all the information about the size of the tasses used in the recipe. But based on the given information, it seems that La Mary needs to add at least 15 more tasses of farina (18 - 2 = 16) to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 11 tasses of farina and she needs to add 4 more tasses (since the recipe requires 14 tasses). So, we need to find out how many tasses of sugar she should add now. Since the recipe requires 5 tasses of sugar and La Mary has already added 11 tasses of farina, she still needs to add 4 tasses of sugar. Therefore, La Mary needs to add 4 more tasses of sugar.
Response:  If La Mary has already put X tasses of flour (where X is some number), then she still needs to put 5X more tasses of flour than sugar.  So, if X = 3, then she needs 5(3) = 15 more tasses of flour.
"Response:  If La Mary needs to use 13 cups of flour and she has already put some, then we can say that she has used x cups of flour so far. Since there are 13 - x cups of flour left to be used, we can write an equation as follows:

x + (13 - x) = 13

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

So, La Mary has put 6 cups of flour so far."
"Response:  We know that we have already added 7 tasses of farina and 60 tasses of sugar. So, if we want to make sure we have enough farina for the recipe, we need to add more farina.  To find out how many tasses of farina we need to add, let's divide the total amount of farina required (14 tasses) by the amount of farina we have already added (7 tasses):

Number of tasses of farina needed = Total amount of farina required - Amount of farina already added
= 14 tasses - 7 tasses
= 7 tasses

So, we need to add 7 more tasses of farina to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 12 tasses of farina and 10 tasses of sugar. To find out how many more tasses of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 11 tasses - 10 tasses = 1 tasse. So, La Mary needs to add one more tasse of sugar.
Response:  We know that we need to add 10 tasses of flour and we have already added 6 tasses. So, we still need to add 4 more tasses (10 - 6 = 4). Therefore, we should add 4 more tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 4 tasses of farina and needs to add more. To find out how many tasses of farina she needs to add, we can use the following formula: Number of tasses of farina = Total amount of farina required - Amount already added / Amount of one tasse of farina So, in this case, the total amount of farina required is 14 tasses (since the recipe requires 14 tasses of farina), and the amount already added is 4 tasses. Therefore, we need to divide the remaining amount by the amount of one tasse of farina (which is 1/4 cup or 8 fluid oz) to get the number of tasses of farina needed: Number of tasses of farina = 14 - 4 / 8 fl oz = 7 tasses So, La Mary needs to add 7 more tasses of farina to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 2 tasses of farina to the mixture and she needs 7 more tasses to complete the recipe. So, we need to find out how many tasses of farina are left to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of farina needed (7 tasses) by the amount of farina La Mary has already added (2 tasses): 7 - 2 = 5 tasses of farina left to add. Therefore, La Mary needs to add 5 more tasses of farina to the mixture.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already put 12 tasses of flour (which is equal to 12/4 = 3 cups). Now we need to find out how much sugar she needs to add. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour, you need 1 1/2 cups of sugar. So, if La Mary has already used 3 cups of flour, she needs to add 3 x 1 1/2 = 4 1/2 cups of sugar. Since there are 11 tasses of sugar in a cup, La Mary needs to add 4 1/2 / 11 = 0.41 tasses of sugar more than she has already added. Therefore, she needs to add 0.41 + 0.6 = 0.81 tasses of sugar more.
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 4 tasses of sugar and needs to add more. To find out how many tasses she needs to add, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (7 tasses) by the amount she has already added (4 tasses). So, La Mary needs to add 3 more tasses of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that La Mary has already added 10 tasses of sugar and she needs to add 14 - 10 = 4 more tasses of flour. So, she should add 4 more tasses of flour now.
Response:  We know that 60 families of birds flew away for winter and there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain. So, the total number of families of birds in the area is 60 + 19 = 79 families. Therefore, the number of families of birds that did not fly away for winter is 79 - 60 = 19 families.
Response:  We know that there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 7 of them flew away for winter. So, the number of families of birds left behind is:  $ Number$ of families of birds left behind = $Number$ of families of birds flying away - $Number$ of families of birds that fled for winter $= 87 - 7 $= $70$ families of birds left behind$.
Response:  We know that out of 20 families of birds, 5 stayed in the mountain area while 15 went to warmer places for winter. So, at the beginning there were 5 + 14 = 19 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 23 families of birds flew to Africa and 37 families of birds flew to Asia. So, in total, we have: 23 + 37 = 60 families of birds that left their original location near the mountain. Therefore, there are 85 - 60 = 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain and they start to migrate as winter approaches.  We also know that out of 42 families of birds, 31 families went to Asia and 9 families went to Africa. So, we can write:  Number of families of birds in Africa = 9  Number of families of birds in Asia = 31 Now, we want to find out how many more families of birds went to Africa than those who went to Asia. To do this, we need to subtract the number of families that went to Asia from the total number of families that started their migration:  Difference between number of families that went to Africa and number of families that went to Asia = 9 - 31 = -22 Therefore, 22 fewer families of birds went to Africa than those who went to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer places during winter.  If 47 families of birds went to Africa and 94 families went to Asia, then we can say that the total number of families of birds that went to Asia is equal to the total number of families of birds that went to Africa plus 94 - 47 = 47 more families. So, the answer is 47 + 47 = 94 families of birds went to Asia compared to the number that went to Africa.
Response:  We know that there are 18 families of birds living near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer places during winter. If 38 families of birds fly to Africa and 80 families fly to Asia, then the total number of families of birds that flew away is: 38 + 80 = 118. So, the number of families of birds that stayed in their original location near the mountain is: 18 - 118 = -100. Therefore, there are -100 families of birds that stayed near the mountain during winter.
Response:  We know that there are already 87 families of birds living near the mountain before the summer arrives. If 18 new families of birds move in during this time, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now: 87 + 18 = 105 families. Therefore, there are 105 families of birds living near the mountain after the arrival of the new families.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds flew south for the winter and 24 new families of birds came from the Arctic to live near the mountain. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is: 59 + 24 = 83 families. Therefore, there are 83 families of birds who stayed near the mountain during the winter.
Response:  We know that initially there were 27 families of birds that flew away to warmer places for winter. Now, we are asked how many families of birds remained near the mountain after they left. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of bird families (initially 41) by the number of families that flew away (27). So, the number of bird families that remained near the mountain is: 41 - 27 = 14.
Response:  We know that 86 families of birds flew away to warmer places for winter from near a mountain.  If there were initially 45 families of birds living near the mountain, then how many more families of birds flew away than those who stayed?  To find this difference, we can subtract the number of families that stayed (45) from the total number of families that fled (86):  Difference = 86 - 45 = 41 families. Therefore, 41 additional families of birds migrated to warmer climates for the winter compared to those who remained near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 35 families of birds went to Asia and 62 families of birds went to Africa. So, we have:  Number of families of birds that went to Africa = 62 - 35 = 27 families. Therefore, there are 27 more families of birds in Africa than in Asia.
Response:  We know that there are three families of birds living near the mountain and they have been there all year round.  Then we learn that 26 new families of birds came from the Arctic to live near the mountain during winter while two families of birds flew further south for the winter. So, in total, how many families of birds stayed near the mountain?  Total number = Number of families already there + Number of new families coming from the north = 3 + 26 = 29 families. Therefore, there are 29 families of birds staying near the mountain.
Response:  We know that Paul received a box of 253 colored pencils for his birthday. Then we are told that he lost or gave away 70 of them during the school year. So, how many pencils does he have left at the end of the school year? To find out, we can simply subtract the number of pencils he lost/gave away from the total number of pencils he had initially: Number of pencils remaining = Total number of pencils - Number of pencils lost/given away In this case, the total number of pencils was 253, and Paul lost/gave away 70, so the number of pencils he has left at the end of the school year is: Number of pencils remaining = 253 - 70 = 183 Therefore, Paul has 183 colored pencils left at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 300 crayons as a gift for his birthday and he lost or gave away 551 of them during the school year. So, at the end of the school year, he had 177 crayons left. Now we want to find out how many crayons were originally given to him. To do this, we can divide the number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year (300) by the number of crayons he had at the end of the school year (177). This gives us:  Number of crayons originally given to Paul = 300 / 177 = 1.72  Therefore, Paul was given 172 crayons as a gift for his birthday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received a total of 440 llapis de color for his birthday. Then, he gave away 111 llapis to his friends during the school year while losing 106 llapis. So, the number of llapis left with him is equal to the initial amount minus the number of llapis given away minus the number of llapis lost. Therefore, the final answer is:  Number of llapis remaining = 440 - 111 - 106 = 223 llapis de color.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received a box of 65 crayons for his birthday. Then, he gave away 213 pencils during the school year while losing 16 pencils. So, in total, Paul had 65 - 16 = 49 pencils at the end of the school year. Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received a total of 589 llapis for his birthday. Then he gave away 571 llapis to his friends during the school year while losing 161 llapis. So, the difference between the number of llapis he gave away and the number he lost is equal to the original amount he received. Therefore, the number of llapis he gave away minus the number he lost is equal to 589 - 161 = 428. Hence, Paul gave away more llapis than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul received $110$ crayons for his birthday and he gave away $90$ crayons to his friends during the school year. So, he has $21$ crayons left with him. Now, we are told that he lost $412$ crayons. To find out how many more crayons he lost than he gave away, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the number of crayons he lost: $$ \therefore 412 - 90 = 322 $$ Therefore, Paul lost $322$ more crayons than he gave away.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 crayons during the school year and lost 558, then he has 332 left. Now, if he received 332 crayons as a gift for his birthday, that means he had 0 crayons before receiving the gift. So, the number of crayons he received as a gift is equal to the number he already had, which is 332. Therefore, he received 332 crayons as a gift.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 crayons and lost 535 crayons. So, he had 492 - (52 + 535) = 492 - 687 = -195 crayons. Therefore, Paul had lost or given away 195 crayons.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 521 llapis and 66 goms. If he didn't lose or give away any goms, then he must have received 521 + 66 = 587 things during the year. At the end of the year, he only had 154 left, so we can deduce that he lost or gave away 587 - 154 = 433 things during the year. Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 433 llapis and goms during the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 531 llapis and 38 goms. If he didn't lose any goms during the year, then he must have received 38 goms in addition to the initial 531 llapis. So, the total number of llapis and goms he got is: 531 + 38 = 569. Now we need to find out how many llapis and goms he has left after one year. From the question, we know that he only lost 39 llapis (not goms), so the remaining llapis are: 569 - 39 = 530. And the remaining goms are also 38. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Number of llapis = 530, Number of goms = 38.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 601 llapis of color and 406 goms of gum. So he had in total 1007 object (601 + 406). Then we are told that after one year, he only lost 336 objects without losing any gomets or llapis. Therefore, the number of gomes of gum left to him is equal to 1007 - 336 = 671.  So, Paul has 671 goms of gum left.
Response:  We know that Paul received 400 crayons as a gift for his birthday and he had 315 of them beforehand. So in total, he has 715 crayons now (400 + 315). But at the end of the school year, only 291 are left because some were lost or given away. Therefore, the number of crayons Paul received as a gift is equal to the number of crayons he had left after the school year ended - 291 = 424.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received a total of 267 pens as gift for his birthday. Then he lost 231 pens during the school year. So, the number of pens he had left is equal to 267 minus 231 = 36. Next, we are told that he gave away 308 pens to his friends. Therefore, the difference between the number of pens he gave away and the number he had left is equal to 308 - 36 = 272. So, Paul gave away more pens than he lost.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 goms and 320 llapis. If he didn't lose any gum or pencils during the year, then he must have received some more gums and llapises as well. So let's call the number of additional gums he got x. Then we can write the equation:  Total gums = Initial gums + Additional gums = 457 + x  Similarly, for the pencils, we can write the equation: Total pencils = Initial pencils + Additional pencils = 320 + x Now, we are told that at the end of the year, Paul had 523 gums left without having lost any. So we can substitute this value in the first equation to get: x = 523 - 457 = 66 Therefore, Paul had 66 additional gums throughout the year. As for the pencils, we can use the same reasoning to find out how many additional pencils he got: x = 523 - 320 = 203 Therefore, Paul had 203 additional pencils throughout the year.
Response:  At first, there were 11 customers. Then some left and there were 3 remaining customers. So, we need to find out how many customers have left compared to those who are still there. In this case, 8 customers have left (11 - 3 = 8). Therefore, there are 3 more customers now than when all 11 customers were present.
Response:  At first, there were 3 clients. Then, some of them left, so the number of clients decreased to 4. So, the number of clients who stayed is equal to the original number minus the number that left. Therefore, the answer is 3 - x, where x is the number of clients that left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 clients. After 9 clients left, there were still 12 clients remaining. So, at the beginning, the number of clients was 9 + 12 = 21 clients.
"Response:  At first, there were 14 customers. Then, 9 of them left (since ""queden"" means ""remain""). So, now there are 5 customers remaining. Therefore, the number of customers the cashier has is 5."
"Response:  At first, the cashier had 13 customers. Then, some of them left and he gained 4 new ones. So, the number of customers the cashier has now is:

13 - (some left) + 4 (new ones) =?

We are not given the exact number of customers who left, so we have to make an assumption. Let's assume that 5 customers left.

So, the equation becomes:

13 - 5 + 4 =?

Solving for the unknown quantity, we get:

8 =?

Therefore, the cashier currently has 8 customers."
Response:  At first, the cashier had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, so he had 12 - 15 = -3 fewer customers. But then, 14 new customers arrived, so he now has 12 + 14 = 26 customers. Therefore, the cashier currently has 26 customers.
Response:  The first client arrived at 10 am and there were no other customers before him. So, initially, there was only one customer (the cashier). Then, another client arrived at 10:30 am, making it two customers in total. Next, three more clients came at 11 am, so now there are five customers in total. Finally, eight new clients arrive between 12 pm and 2 pm, for a total of thirteen customers. Therefore, the answer is 8 new clients have arrived.
Response:  At first, the cashier had 8 customers. Then some left and he was left with 5 customers. After that, he managed to acquire 99 new customers. So, in total, he has 99 + 5 = 104 customers now.
Response:  At first, the cashier had 12 customers. Then some left and he/she had 14 customers remaining. After that, he/she acquired 10 new customers. So, in total, the cashier has now 14 + 10 = 24 customers.
Response:  Firstly, Dan had $3 with him after buying a chocolate bar for $2. So, he spent $2 to buy the chocolate bar. Now, he has $3 - $2 = $1 left with him. Therefore, Dan initially had $1.
Response:  If Dan had $4 and he spent money on something that left him with $3, then we can say that the amount he spent is equal to the difference between his initial amount ($4) and his remaining amount ($3). So, the cost of whatever he bought = $4 - $3 = $1. Therefore, the bar of chocolate cost $1.
"Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys 99 bars of chocolate for $3 each, he will spend a total of:
$4 + ($3 x 99) = $4 + $297 = $301
So, after buying the chocolate, Dan will have $4 - $301 = -$297 left."
Response:  If Dan has $3 and buys 2 barrels of chocolate for $4 each, then he will spend a total of $4 + $4 = $8. So, each barrel of chocolate costs him $8 / 2 = $4.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and he bought some chocolate bars for $6 each, then he spent a total of $6 + $6 = $12. So, if he spent $12 to buy chocolate bars, that means he must have bought $\frac{12}{3} = 4$ chocolate bars. Therefore, Dan bought 4 chocolate bars.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent 2 dollars for the bar of chocolate, so he has 7 - 2 = 5 dollars left. Then, he spent another 3 dollars for the other chocolate, so now he has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left. Therefore, Dan has 2 dollars left after buying both chocolates.
Response:  If Dan has $4 and he bought a bar of chocolate for $7, then he spent $7 - $4 = $3 on the bar of chocolate.  And if he also bought a piece of chocolate for $6, then he spent $6 on that one. So in total, Dan spent $3 + $6 = $9 on both items.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and he bought a chocolate bar for $6, then he spent $6 - $2 = $4 on the chocolate bar.  Now, he also bought another piece of chocolate for $3, so he spent an additional $3. Therefore, in total, Dan spent $4 + $3 = $7 on buying both pieces of chocolate.
Response:  If Dan spent $2 to buy one bar of chocolate and $3 to buy another piece of chocolate, then he spent a total of $2 + $3 = $5 on chocolate. So, he spent $5 on chocolate that he bought for himself.
Response:  Firstly, Dan had $4 dollars and he bought a chocolate bar for $8. So now he has $4 - $8 =-$4. Then his friend gave him $5. Now he has $4 + $5 = $9. Therefore, Dan has $9 dollars left.
Response:  If he had 4 dollars at first and spent 3 dollars on the chocolate bar, then he has 1 dollar left after buying the chocolate bar. So, the cost of the chocolate bar is equal to 1 dollar. Therefore, the answer is 1$.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spent $3 to buy 10 chocolate bars. So, how much money does Dan have left?  Money left = Total amount of money - Amount spent = $4 - $3 = $1. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after buying the chocolate bars.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolate bars for a total of $4. So, if each chocolate bar costs the same amount of money, we can write an equation: 3 = 2x where x is the cost of one chocolate bar. Now, we solve for x: x = $3 / 2 = $1.50 per chocolate bar. Therefore, each chocolate bar cost $1.50.
Response:  If Dan has $5 and he bought a chocolate for $3, then he has $2 left ($5 - $3 = $2). Then, he bought another chocolate for $7, so now he has spent a total of $2 + $7 = $9. Therefore, he spent $9 to buy a bar of chocolate.
Response:  If Dan spent $4 on something else, and he bought a chocolate bar for $7, then he has $4 - $7 = -$3 left. So he cannot have bought any chocolate bars. Now let's consider the second part of the question: if he bought a chocolate bar for $2, then he has $2 + (-$3) = $1 left. Therefore, Dan spent $1 to buy chocolate that he could not spend to buy barrels of chocolate.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them in a garage sale. So, the number of books left with him is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ books\ left\ with\ Paul = 115 - 78 = 37 $$
So, Paul has 37 books left after selling 78 at the garage sale."
Response:  If Paul had initially x books and sold 137 of them, then he has fewer books left. So we can write an equation:  x - 137 = 105. Now solve for x :  x = 246. Therefore,Paul had 246 books at first.
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books initially and after selling some of them in a garage sale he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Books available = Initial books - Number sold (in garage sale) Now, let's find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale. According to the question, he sold some books and gave 35 books to his friend. So, the number of books he sold is equal to the number of books he gave away minus the number of books he still has: Number sold = Number given away - Number remaining (after giving away) In this case, the number of books Paul gave away is 35, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation: Number sold = 35 - 62 = -27 Books sold in garage sale = -27 Therefore, Paul sold 27 books in the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying some more in a garage sale he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books Paul had = 50 Books bought at garage sale = 151 - 50 = 101 Therefore, Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially two books (2). Then he sold some of them in a garage sale and bought new ones (150). So, after selling/buying, he has 58 books now. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he had before from the current number: 58 - 2 = 56. Therefore, Paul sold 56 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale to raise money for his trip. After selling some books, he bought 42 new ones. So, now he has 15 books left. To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we can subtract the number of books he bought from the total number of books he had at first: 21 - 42 = -21. Therefore, Paul sold fewer books than he bought.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Then, he bought 38 new books, so his current total is 71 + 38 = 109 books. But according to the question, he now has 116 books, which means he must have bought more than he sold. So, we can set up an equation: 116 - x = 109. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. Therefore, Paul bought 7 books more than he sold at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some books and pens at a garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Books = 108 - x Pens = 55 - y Where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale, and y is the number of pens sold. Now, we are asked to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can substitute the value given in the question into our equation: Books = 108 - x Pens = 55 - y Substituting x = 66 (the number of books left after the sale), we get: Books = 108 - 66 = 42 Pens = 55 - 66 = -11 Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 51 books and 106 pens. If he sold some of them in the garage sale, we can write an equation based on the information given: Books = 82 (since he has 82 books left) Pens = 14 (since he has 14 pens left) Now, let's solve for the number of pens he sold at the garage sale: Number of pens sold = Total number of pens - Number of pens left = 106 - 14 = 92 So, Paul sold 92 pens in the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially $136$ books and he sold some of them in the garage sale. Let's say he sold $\boxed{x}$ books. Since he has $\boxed{27}$ books left after the sale, we can write an equation: $\boxed{136 - x = 27}$. Now, we need to solve for $\boxed{x}$, which gives us $\boxed{x = 99}$. So, Paul originally had $\boxed{99}$ books before selling any at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave 39 to his friend. So he had 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then he sold some books in a garage sale and ended up with 95 - x = 68 books, where x is the number of books he sold. Since he had 68 books left after selling some books, we can set up the equation: 95 - x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Paul sold 27 books in the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 books and 153 pens. After selling some books and pens at a garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Books = 95 - 13 = 82 Pens = 153 - 23 = 130 Now, we want to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books he had left after the sale from the initial number of books he had. So, the number of books Paul sold at the garage sale is: Books sold = 82 - (13 - 153) = 82 - (-67) = 149 Therefore, Paul sold 149 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 books and 143 pens. After selling some books and pens at a garage sale, he was left with 113 books and 19 pens. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of pens sold = Total number of pens - Number of pens left after the sale  Number of pens sold = 19 - x Where x is the number of pens Paul sold at the garage sale To find out how many pens Paul sold, we need to solve for x in the above equation. Based on the given information, we know that x = 19 - 14 = 5 So, Paul sold 5 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  There were originally 10 roses in the floral arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden and added them to the arrangement. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the floral arrangement.
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the floral arrangement (as Jessica had cut from her garden). Then, she added 16 more roses to it, making the total number of roses 32 (16 + 16 = 32). So, initially, there were 16 roses in the floral arrangement.
Response:  Firstly, there were two roses in the flower arrangement (given). Then, Jessica threw four new roses into the flower arrangement and cut some new roses from her garden to add to it. Now, there are 23 roses in the flower arrangement. So, we can conclude that Jessica cut 21 new roses from her garden (23 - 2 = 21).
Response:  Firstly, there were 15 roses in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica threw away 33 roses from her garden of flowers and added new ones to the flower arrangement. So, now there are 17 roses in the flower arrangement. To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses thrown away (33) from the total number of roses in the flower arrangement after adding new ones (17). Therefore, Jessica cut 16 more roses than she threw away.
Response:  Firstly, there were 21 roses in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica threw away 34 roses from her garden and added new ones to the flower arrangement. So, now there are 15 roses in the flower arrangement. To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than she added, we can subtract the number of new roses (34) from the total number of roses thrown away (34 + 15 = 49). Therefore, Jessica threw away 34 - 34 = 0 roses more than she added.
Response:  We know that there were initially 60 roses in Jessica's garden (including the 59 she had). Then, she cut some more roses from her garden, which brought the total number of roses to 20. So, we can say that Jessica cut 40 roses (60 - 20 = 40) from her garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica had 12 roses in her garden before she cut some more from it. So, there were originally 12 - 1 = 11 roses in her garden. Now, after cutting some more roses and bringing them to the flower shop, there are 21 roses in the flower shop. Therefore, the number of roses left in Jessica's garden is 11.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the floral arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 3 roses from her garden (since she had 15 roses to start with). So now, there are 15 - 3 = 12 roses left in the floral arrangement. Similarly, we can find out how many orchids were left after Jessica cut some of them from her garden. From the problem statement, we know that after cutting the orchids, there are 62 - 9 = 53 orchids remaining in the floral arrangement. Therefore, Jessica cut 9 orchids from her garden. Now, let's calculate the number of roses that Jessica cut: Number of roses cut = Total number of roses - Initial number of roses = 12 - 15 = -3 roses. So, Jessica cut -3 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 2 orchids in the floral arrangement.  After Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the floral arrangement. So, to find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of orchids (2) from the final number of orchids (21): 21 - 2 = 19. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orchids from her garden.
Response:  Firstly, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the floral arrangement initially. Then, Jessica cut 2 roses from her garden. So now, there are 7 roses (5 + 2) left in the arrangement. Next, she cut 2 more orchids from her garden. Therefore, there are currently 9 orchids (3 + 2) remaining in the arrangement. Finally, we need to find out how many roses are left after cutting those two orchids. There are 7 roses left because 2 of them were already cut earlier. So, the final number of roses left in the arrangement is 7 - 2 = 5 roses. Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers left in the arrangement: Total flowers = Roses + Orchids = 5 + 2 = 7 flowers.
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 orchids and 12 roses in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 3 roses from her garden. So now there are 9 roses left (initially there were 12 - 3 = 9). Now we need to find out how many orchids are left after Jessica cut them. From the information given, we can see that Jessica cut 6 orchids from her garden. So now there are 14 orchids left (initially there were 12 + 6 = 14) in the flower arrangement. Therefore, there are 7 more orchids than roses in the floral arrangement now (14 orchids - 9 roses = 7).
Response:  If there were initially three roses in the vase (floral), and Jessica added 16 more roses from her garden, then she must have cut 13 roses from her garden to add them to the vase. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 5 roses from her garden (since she had 13 - 5 = 8 roses left). Now, we have 91 orchids and 14 roses in the arrangement. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses she had after cutting them from the initial number of roses: 14 - 8 = 6 roses. Therefore, Jessica cut 6 roses from her garden.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 orchids and 16 roses in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 2 orchids and 4 roses from her garden. So now we have 7 orchids (initially + 2 she cut) and 10 roses (initially - 4 she cut). Therefore, Jessica cut 2 orchids.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the floral arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 3 roses from her garden. So now, there are 6 + 3 = 9 roses left in the arrangement. Similarly, we can find out how many orchids are left by subtracting the number of orchids that Jessica cut from the initial total. Therefore, the number of orchids left after cutting 3 orchids is 20 - 3 = 17 orchids. Now, let's calculate the final count of roses and orchids in the floral arrangement: Roses: Initially, there were 6 roses, then Jessica cut 3 more, so the final count of roses is 6 + 3 = 9 roses. Orchids: Initially, there were 20 orchids, then Jessica cut 3 more, so the final count of orchids is 20 - 3 = 17 orchids. Therefore, there are 9 roses and 17 orchids in the floral arrangement now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the flower arrangement. Then, Jessica cut 3 roses from her garden. Now, we have 6 roses left in the arrangement (initially + new ones = total). Similarly, we know that Jessica also cut 2 orchids from her garden. So now, we have 4 orchids remaining in the arrangement (initially + new ones = total). Therefore, the number of orchids more than roses in the floral arrangement is 4 - 6 = -2.
Response:  We know that Robin's hair is 17 inches long and it was cut off some centimeters.  If his hair is now 13 inches long, then we can calculate how many centimeters he lost as follows:  Length of hair before cutting = 17 inches = 43 cm (since there are 2.54 cm in an inch)  Length of hair after cutting = 13 inches = 33 cm (since there are 2.54 cm in an inch)  Now, we want to find out how many centimeters were cut from his hair. To do this, we subtract the length of his hair after cutting from the length of his hair before cutting:  Difference in length = 33 cm - 43 cm = -9 cm (negative because he lost centimeters) So, Robin lost 9 centimeters of his hair.
Response:  If Robin had 20 inches of hair before cutting it and now it is 10 inches long, then we can calculate how much he cut off using subtraction. So, the length of his hair before cutting = 20 inches - (length of hair after cutting) = 20 inches - 10 inches = 10 inches. Therefore, the length of Robin's hair before cutting was 10 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair was originally 16 inches long (which is equal to 40 cm). Then, it was cut off and reduced to 15 cm. Afterwards, it grew back to 12 inches (which is equal to 30 cm). So, now Robin's hair is 30 cm long.
Response:  If Robin's ponytail was originally 19 inches long and it grew an additional 18 inches, then its new length would be:  Length = Original length + Additional growth = 19 + 18 = 37 inches
"Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of his hair initially, and he had 14 inches of hair to start with, then the length of his hair after cutting is:

Length of hair after cutting = Initial length of hair - Length cut off
= 14 inches - 13 inches
= 1 inch

So, Robin's hair is now 1 inch long."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair was initially 14 inches long. Then it grew by 8 inches, so its new length is: 14 + 8 = 22 inches. Finally, when it was cut off by 20 inches, its current length would be: 22 - 20 = 2 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair now has a length of 2 inches.
Response:  If En Danny has 12 bottle caps in his collection and he found 53 beer cans at the park, then we need to find out how many bottles are there.  We know that each beer can contains 24 bottles, so if En Danny found 53 cans, then he found 53 x 24 = 1268 bottles. Therefore, En Danny now has 12 + 1268 = 1280 bottle caps in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 21 bottles in his collection and then found some more at the park. So, he now has 53 bottles in total. To find out how many bottles he found at the park, we can divide the total number of bottles he has now (53) by the original number he had in his collection (21): 53 / 21 = 2.56 Therefore, Danny found 2.56 bottles at the park.
"Response:  We know that Danny collected bottles and found 63 while throwing away 51 old ones. So he has 33 new bottles in his collection now. To find out how many bottles Danny had at first, we can use the information given in the problem: ""Danny started with 51 bottles."" Therefore, the number of bottles Danny had at first is 51."
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 tapes of bottles in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 tapes of bottles left in his collection now. To find out how many more bottle caps he found than he threw away, we can subtract the number of bottles he threw away from the total number of bottles he found:  Number of bottle caps found = Total number of bottles found - Number of bottles thrown away  In this case, the total number of bottles found is 36 (the number he found in the park) minus the number of bottles thrown away is 35 (since he threw away 35 old bottles). Therefore, the number of bottle caps he found is: Number of bottle caps found = 36 - 35 = 1 So, Danny found one more bottle cap than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 tapes of bottles in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he has 42 tapes of bottles now. To find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw than he found, we can subtract the number of bottles he found from the total number of bottles he threw away: 63 - 30 = 33 Therefore, Danny threw away 33 more bottle caps than he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 22 tapes and 8 envelopes in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 items at first. Then, he found more tapes and envelopes, which increased his collection to 28 tapes and 63 envelopes. Therefore, Danny had 30 (initial) + 28 (newly found) = 58 items in total.
Response:  At first, Danny had 30 envelopes and he found 22 tape covers in the park. So, now he has 17 tapes and 57 envelopes. Therefore, at first, Danny had 57 - 30 = 27 envelopes.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 tapes of bottles and 14 wrappings in the park. Then he found 7 more tapes and 86 more wrappings at home. So, the total number of tapes he found is 30 + 7 = 37 tapes. Similarly, the total number of wrappings he found is 14 + 86 = 100 wrappings. Therefore, the number of caps of bottles that Danny found more than wrappings is 100 - 37 = 63.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 11 tape covers and 28 label stickers in the park. So he had 68 tape covers + 28 label stickers = 96 items initially. Now we are told that he found more items at the park, which means he has more than 96 items now. Therefore, the number of tape covers Danny found at the park is equal to the total number of items he has now minus the initial number of items he had, or:  Number of tape covers found = Total number of items - Initial number of items  In this case, the total number of items Danny has is 68 tape covers + 51 envelope labels = 119 items. So, the number of tape covers Danny found at the park is:  Number of tape covers found = 119 - 96 = 23  Therefore, Danny found 23 more tape covers than he already had at the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 71 tapes of bottles and 24 envelopes in the park. So he had a total of 95 objects (71 tapes + 24 envelopes). Then, he found 28 more tapes of bottles and 16 more envelopes. Therefore, his current collection consists of 28 tapes of bottles and 16 envelopes. To find out how many more bottle caps than envelopes Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of envelopes from the number of tapes: 28 tapes - 16 envelopes = 12 more tapes of bottles. So, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than envelopes in his collection now.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 tapes and 62 envelopes in the park. So, he had a total of 72 items (10 tapes + 62 envelopes). Then, he found more tapes and envelopes in the park, which increased his collection to 27 tapes and 43 envelopes. Therefore, Danny now has 79 items in his collection (27 tapes + 43 envelopes). So, he has 79 - 72 = 7 more envelopes than tapes.
Response:  We know that Danny collected bottle caps and lost 66 of them in the park. So he had 25 - 66 = -41 bottle caps at first. Therefore, Danny had 41 bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  Before finding any bottles in the park, Danny had 25 bottles in his collection. So he found x bottles in the park. Therefore, Danny now has 25 + x bottles in his collection. Since he found 32 bottles in total, we can set up the equation: 25 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So before finding any bottles in the park, Danny had 25 bottles in his collection and he found 7 more bottles in the park, increasing his total collection to 32 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danny collected bottles and threw away 60 old ones in the park while finding 58 new ones. So he now has 67 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we can set up an equation based on the information given: Number of bottle caps Danny had = Number of bottle caps he found + Number of bottle caps he threw away - Number of new bottle caps he found  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of bottle caps Danny had = 58 + 60 - 58 = 60 Therefore, Danny had 60 bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 old bottles in the park and threw away 6 more. So he has 6 + 6 = 12 bottle caps in his collection now. Then we are told that he found 50 new bottle caps in the park. Therefore, the total number of bottle caps Danny found is 12 (from his collection) + 50 = 62.  So, Danny found 62 more bottle caps than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 old bottles in the park and found 48 new bottle caps there. So he has 52 bottle caps in his collection now. To find out how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than he found, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he collected:  Number of bottle caps thrown away = Total number of bottle caps collected - Number of bottle caps found  In this case, the total number of bottle caps collected is 54 + 48 = 102. Since Danny found 48 bottle caps, the number of bottle caps thrown away is: Number of bottle caps thrown away = 102 - 48 = 54 Therefore, Danny threw away 54 more bottle caps than he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 82 envelopes and 29 caps of bottles in the park. Now he has 42 caps of bottles and 61 envelopes in his collection. So, initially, Danny had 82 + 29 = 111 petals.
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 envelopes and 0 tapes of bottles in the park. Then he found 39 more tapes of bottles and added them to his collection. So, now he has 68 envelopes and 16 tapes of bottles. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 66 + 16 = 82 envelopes and 0 tapes of bottles.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 envelopes and 50 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 envelopes in his collection. So, we need to find out how many more bottle caps than envelopes Danny found at the park.  To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of bottle caps = Original number of bottle caps - Number of bottle caps in the collection Number of envelopes = Original number of envelopes - Number of envelopes in the collection Substituting the given values, we get: Number of bottle caps = 50 - 21 = 29 Number of envelopes = 50 - 52 = -3 Therefore, Danny found 29 more bottle caps than envelopes at the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 65 envelopes and 5 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 envelopes in his collection. So, we need to find out how many more envelopes than cap he found in the park.  To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of envelopes found = Total number of envelopes found - Number of envelopes in the collection Number of cap found = Total number of cap found - Number of cap in the collection In this case, the total number of envelopes found is 65, and the total number of cap found is 5 + 31 = 36. Therefore, the difference between the number of envelopes found and the number of envelopes in the collection is 65 - 9 = 56. Similarly, the difference between the number of cap found and the number of cap in the collection is 5 + 31 = 36. So, Danny found 56 more envelopes than cap in the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 bottle caps and 25 corks in the park. Then he found 11 more corks and 12 more bottle caps at his house. So, the total number of bottle caps he has now is:  Initially, he had 58 + 11 = 69 bottle caps. Similarly, the total number of corks he has now is:  Initially, he had 25 + 12 = 37 corks. Therefore, Danny has 69 bottle caps and 37 corks in his collection now.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 15 tapes and 18 envelopes in the park. So he had 15 + 18 = 33 objects in total. Then, after collecting more tapes and envelopes, he now has 67 envelopes and 35 tapes. Therefore, the difference between the number of envelopes and tapes is: 67 - 35 = 32. So, Danny now has 32 more envelopes than tapes.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer perches than Steven and Jake has 17 fish. So if we subtract 11 from 17, we get 6. Therefore, Steven has 6 perches.
Response:  We know that en Jake has 7 less persecutions than en Steven. So, if en Steven has x persecutions, then en Jake has x - 7 persecutions.  Moreover, we are told that en Steven has 14 more persecutions than en Jill. Therefore, if en Jill has y persecutions, then en Steven has y + 14 persecutions. Finally, we are given that en Steven has 15 persimmons. So, if en Steven has x persecutions, then he has 15 - x persimmons.  Now, let's substitute these values in the equation and solve for x: x = (y + 14) - 15...(1)  Substituting y = 14 (since en Steven has 14 more persecutions than en Jill), we get: x = 29...(2)  Thus, en Jake has 29 persecutions.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 less pursues than Steven, so Jake has 18 + 19 = 37 pursues. Therefore, Jill has 37 - 13 = 24 pursues. So, Jill has 24 pursues.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less pursues than Steven, so Jake has 3 + 8 = 11 purses more than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 11 - 5 = 6 more pursues than Jill. So, Jake has 6 more pursues than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 less pursues than Steven, so Steven has 12 + 1 = 13 more pursues than Jake.  And we also know that Jill has 4 fish. So, to find out how many more pursues Jill has than Jake, we need to subtract Jill's number of fish from Jake's number of pursues minus Steven's number of pursues plus Jill's number of fish.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 pursues.  Steven has 13 more pursues than Jake, so Steven has 8 + 13 = 21 pursues.  Now, to find out how many more pursues Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jill's number of fish (4) from Jake's number of pursues minus Steven's number of pursues plus Jill's number of fish:  Jill has 21 - 4 = 17 more pursues than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less persecutions than Steven and 9 more persecutions than Jill. So, if Steven has 16 fishing, then Jake has 16 - 7 = 9 fishing. Therefore, Jake has 9 persecutions.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less persecutions than Steven and 8 more persecutions than Jill. So, if Steven has x persecutions, then Jake has x - 7 persecutions, and Jill has x + 8 persecutions. Since Steven has 17 fish, we can write an equation based on this information: x = 17. Substituting this value into the equation for Jake's persecutions, we get: (x - 7) = 7. Solving for x, we find that Jake has 10 persecutions. Therefore, Jill has 28 persecutions.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 less persecutions than Steven and 18 more persecutions than Jill. So, if we write down what we know about each of them, we get:
Jake - 9 persecutions fewer than Steven = Jake has x persecutions
Jake - 18 persecutions more than Jill = Jake has y persecutions
We are also given that Steven has 16 fish. Therefore, we can set up two equations using this information:
x + 16 = y (from the fact that Steven has 16 fish)
x - 9 = y - 18 (from the comparison between Jake and Steven)
Now we need to solve for y, which represents the number of persecutions that Steven has. To do this, we can add equation (2) to equation (1):
x - 9 = y - 18
Adding these two equations gives us:
2x = y - 34
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = y / 2
Substituting the value of y from equation (1), we get:
x = (y - 16) / 2
Simplifying, we get:
x = 10
So, Steven has 10 persecutions more than Jill."
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer perches than Steven. So if Steven has x perches, then Jake has x - 6 perches.  We also know that Steven has 18 more perches than Jill. So if Jill has y perches, then Steven has y + 18 perches.  Now we are given that Jill has 5 fish. So if Jake has x perches and Steven has y + 18 perches, then Jake has 5 fish.  Therefore, Jake has x - 6 = 5 perches.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than five perches than Steven. So, if Steven has x perches, then Jake has less than x - 5 = x - 4 perches.  Now we are told that Steven has 18 more perches than Jill. So, if Jill has y perches, then Steven has y + 18 = y + 12 perches.  Finally, we are asked how many more perches Jake has than Jill. Since Jake has less than four perches than Steven, and Steven has 12 more perches than Jill, we can say that Jake has less than (x - 4) - (y + 12) = -6 perches fewer than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 81 perches fewer than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 less persecutions than Steven and Steven has 15 more persecoctions than Jill. So if Jill has 12 fishes, then Jake must have 38 (16 - 15) more fishes than Jill. Therefore, Jake has 40 fishes in total (16 + 38).
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 less pursues than Steven and he has 79 more pome...

Question: En Jake té 12 persegudes menys i 79 pomes més que en Steven. Steven té 19 persiques i 14 pomes. Quantes pergesques té en Jake?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step.
We know that Jake has 12 less pursues than Steven and he has 79 more pommes than Steven. So, Jake has 12 + 79 = 91 fruits in total.
Steven has 19 persimmons and 14 pomes, so he has a total of 19 + 14 = 33 fruits.
Therefore, Jake has 91 - 33 = 58 fruits."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 13 less persimmons than Steven and 3 more pome...

Question: En Jake té 13 persegudes menys i 3 pomes més que en Steven. Steven té 9 persiques i 8 pomes. Quantes pomes té en Jake?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that Jake has 13 fewer persimmons than Steven and 3 more poms than Steven. So, if Steven has x pomes, then Jake has x + 3 pomes. Therefore, the number of poms Jake has is x + 3."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 less pursues than Steven and 8 more poms than Steven. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:

Pursues = 6 - x (where x is the number of pursues that Jake has)
Pomes = 8 + x (where x is the number of poms that Jake has)

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

Pursues = 6 - x
Pomes = 8 + x

We are also told that Steven has 17 pursues and 16 poms. So, we can write:

17 = x + 6 (since Jake has 6 fewer pursues than Steven)
16 = x + 8 (since Jake has 8 more poms than Steven)

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 9

So, Steven has 9 more pursues than Jake, and 9 more poms than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer persimmons than Steven and 10 more pomes than Steven. So, if we write it in an equation, we have: Persimmons = 10 + (3 - x) Pomes Where ""x"" is the number of persimmons that Steven has. Now, we are told that Steven has 12 persimmons and 15 pomes. So, substituting these values into our equation, we get: Persimmons = 10 + (3 - 12) Pomes = 10 + (-9) Pomes = -1 Pomes Therefore, Steven has one less pomegranate than Jake."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 persimmons and Jake has 4 less than Steven, so Jake has 8 persimmons.  We also know that Jill has 67 more persimmons than Jake, so Jill has 75 persimmons (67 + 8). Therefore, Jake has 8 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 purses and Jake has 12 less purses than Steven. So, if Steven has x purse, then Jake has x - 12 purses. Now we are told that Jill has 8 more purses than Steven. Therefore, Jill has x + 8 purses. Since Jill has fewer pursues than Jake, we can say that Jill has x + 8 < x - 12. Simplifying this inequality, we get x = 6. So, Jill has 6 purses.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 purses and Jake has fewer than 19 purses but more than 12 purses. So, Jake must have 13 or 14 purses. Also, we know that Jill has 72 purses more than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 13 + 72 = 85 purses in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 less persecutions than Steven and 3 more persecutions than Jill. So, if Steven has 14 persecutions, Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 persecutions. And if Jill has 3 more persecutions than Jake, then she has 8 + 3 = 11 persecutions. Therefore, the number of persecutions that Jill has is 11.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x persimmons, then Jake has x + 84 = 92 persimmons. Since Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven, we can conclude that x < 10. Therefore, Jake has exactly 10 persimmons.
Response:  We know that en Jake has 13 more pears than en Steven. So, if en Steven has x pears, then en Jake has x + 13 pears.  Now we are told that en Steven has 8 persimmons and en Jake has 12 pomes (not pears). Therefore, we can set up the equation:  x + 13 = 8  Solving for x, we get:  x = 5  So, en Jake has 13 more pears than en Steven, which means he has 13 + 5 = 18 pears in total.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 less pursuits than Steven and 10 more poms than Steven. So, if we write it down as an equation: Pursues = 8 - x Pomes = 10 + y Where x is the number of pursuits that Jake has and y is the number of poms that Jake has. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Pursues = 8 - x Pomes = 10 + y Substituting the value for x from the question: Pursues = 8 - 8 = 0 Pomes = 10 + y Substituting the value for y from the question: Pomes = 10 + 10 = 20 Therefore, Steven has 20 more poms than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer persimmons than Steven and 4 more apples than Steven. So, if we write it in mathematical notation, we have:

Jake has 3(fewer) = -3 persimmons
Jake has 4(more) = 4 apples

So, the total number of persimmons that Steven has is:
Steven has 19 + (-3) = 16 persimmons
And the total number of apples that Steven has is:
Steven has 4 + 4 = 8 apples
Therefore, Steven has 8 more apples than persimmons."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were $78 in Olivia's wallet initially. Then, she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, the amount of money left with her is: $$78 - 15 = 63$$ Therefore, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet.
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left, then she must have had $101 initially (since $33 is less than $78). So, her initial amount of money was $101.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were $100 in Olivia's purse initially. Then she withdrew an additional $148 from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, she had $159 left. So, the amount she spent at the supermarket is: $148 - $100 = $48.
Response:  Firstly, there were $3 in Olivia's wallet. Then she withdrew $49 from an ATM. After that, she spent $49 at the supermarket and had $49 left. So, how much more did she withdraw at the cashier than at the supermarket?  Therefore, the difference between the amount she withdrew at the cashier and the amount she spent at the supermarket is $49 - $49 = $0.  Hence, Olivia didn't cash any money at the cashier.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were $53 in Olivia's wallet initially. Then she withdrew $91 from an ATM, so her new balance is: $53 + $91 = $144. Next, after visiting the supermarket, she had $14 left, which means she spent $144 - $14 = $130 at the supermarket. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $130.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were $106 in Olivia's wallet initially. Then she spent some money at the exhibition and had $26 left afterward. We are asked to find out how much she spent at the supermarket. Since she spent $49 at the exhibition, she must have spent less than that amount at the supermarket. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $26 - $49 =-$23. So, Olivia spent $23 at the supermarket.
Response:  If initially she had $54 in her wallet and after visiting the store she was left with $29, then we can say that she spent $\$54 - \$29 = \$25$.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the grocery store and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she must have had $90 left after buying the groceries ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications on his phone initially.  He has deleted 5 of them. So, the number of applications left on his phone is: 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, there were 14 applications remaining on Dave's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
Response:  At first, Dave had some applications on his phone. After deleting 18 of them, he was left with 5. So, at the beginning, Dave had 18 - 5 = 13 applications on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, his total number of applications was 21 (10 + 11). Then he deleted some applications, leaving him with 4. Therefore, the number of applications Dave deleted is equal to 21 - 4 = 17.
Response:  Firstly, Dave had 21 applications on his phone and then he added 89 new ones. So, in total, he had 21 + 89 = 106 applications on his phone after adding the new ones. Now, he eliminated some of them, leaving him with 24 applications. Therefore, the number of applications that Dave added minus the number of applications he eliminated is: 106 - 24 = 82 applications.
Response:  Firstly, Dave had 15 applications on his phone and added 71 new ones, so he now has 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). Then, after deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, the number of applications that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the total number of applications he had and the number of applications he was left with: 86 - 14 = 72. Therefore, Dave eliminated 72 applications more than the number he added.
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 5 applications and 23 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave deleted, we can divide the number of remaining applications (5) by the initial number of applications (16): Number of applications deleted = Remaining applications / Initial number of applications = 5/16 = 3 Therefore, Dave deleted 3 applications.
Response:  At first, Dave had 17 applications and 21 files in his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 3 applications and 7 files. So, he has deleted 14 applications (17 - 3 = 14) and 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 21 applications and 4 files. So, in total, Dave has 21 + 4 = 25 items left on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 6 applications and 15 files. So, in total, Dave had 6 + 15 = 21 items on his phone after deleting some of them. Therefore, the number of applications plus files that Dave had left on his phone is 21.
Response:  At first, Dave had 17 applications on his phone. Then he added some more applications and now has 18 applications in total. So, the number of applications that Dave has added is equal to the difference between the original number (17) and the new number (18). Therefore, the answer is: 18 - 17 = 1 application.
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and applications in his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, leaving him with 12 applications and 30 archives. So, we can say that he deleted 47 files (59 - 12 = 47).
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 17 applications and 21 archives. So, he has deleted 7 applications (13 - 17 = 7) and 9 files (21 - 24 = 9).
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 5 files and 12 applications. So, in total, Dave has 5 + 12 = 17 items left on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 24 files and 2 applications. So, in total, Dave had 26 items (2 applications + 24 files) on his phone after deleting some of them. Therefore, the number of applications minus the number of files is equal to 26 - 3 = 23 applications left on Dave's phone.
Response:  If Nell had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has fewer cards left. So, the number of cards that Nell still has is equal to 242 minus the number of cards she gave to Jeff. In this case, it is 242 - 136 = 106. Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
Response:  Initially, Nell had 301 cards. Then she gave 301 of them to Jeff. So, now she has 301 - 301 = 0 cards left. Therefore, initially Nell had 0 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, we can write an equation:  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = Total number of cards Nell had - Number of cards Nell has now.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 528 - 252 = 276 cards. Therefore, Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, Jeff now has 234 cards + (566 - 535) = 91 cards. Therefore, Jeff has 234 + 91 = 325 cards now.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving them away, she has fewer cards than before.  We can say that Nell has x baseball cards left.  Now, we are told that she also gave away some of her 10-target cards, so she has y fewer cards of this type.  Since Nell gave away some cards but not all of them, we can assume that she still has some baseball cards left after giving away the 10-target cards. Therefore, we can write an equation:
x + y = 309 (baseball cards)
x - y = 149 (10-target cards)
Now we need to solve for x and y. To do this, we can add Equation 2 to Equation 1:
x + y = 309... (1)
x - y = 149... (2)
Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1 gives us:
2x = 458
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 229
So, Nell has 229 baseball cards left. As for the number of 10-target cards she has, we can find it by subtracting the number of cards she gave away from the original amount:
y = 149 - 356 = -207
Therefore, Nell has -207 10-target cards left."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving them away, she has 404 baseball cards left. Now, let's find out how many more targets of 10 than baseball cards she has. We can do this by subtracting the number of baseball cards from the total number of targeted cards:  Number of targeted cards = 214 - 246 = -32 Number of more targets of 10 than baseball cards = 495 - 404 = 91 Therefore, Nell has 91 more targets of 10 than baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she has 210 cards left. So, if she gave more than zero cards to Jeff, then we can say that she gave x cards to him. Since she gave fewer cards to John than to Jeff, we have the following inequality:  x + 195 > 573. Solving for x, we get:  x = 378. Therefore, Nell gave 378 cards to Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell had 18 cards of number 10 and she gave some to Jeff. So, now she has 55 - 18 = 37 cards left.  Now we are told that she has 178 baseball cards in total. So, out of her remaining 37 cards, she must have 37 / 5 = 7 cards of number 10. Therefore, Nell has 7 + 18 = 25 cards of number 10.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So, after giving them away, she had 376 cards of type 10 (tennis) and 111 baseball cards. Now, we want to find out how many more tennis cards than baseball cards Nell has. To do this, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards she has: Number of tennis cards = Total number of cards - Number of baseball cards = 376 - 111 = 265 Therefore, Nell has 265 more tennis cards than baseball cards.
Response:  If El Paco had 19 galetes and then he ate some of them, that means he has less now than at first. So, if he started with x galetes, we can write an equation: 19 = x - 35. Now solve for x: x = 55. Therefore, El Paco started with 55 galetes.
Response:  If El Paco has eaten 28 galetes and he has left 7 galetes, then we can say that he has eaten half of them (since 28 is divided by 2 = 14). So, El Paco has eaten 14 galetes.
Response:  Firstly, Paco had 40 galetes and he ate two of them, so he has 40 - 2 = 38 galetes left. Then, he bought 37 more galetes, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 galetes in total. Therefore, Paco has 75 galetes left.
Response:  Firstly, Paco has eaten 25 galetes and then he hasn't eaten any more than that. So, the number of galetes he has eaten is equal to 25. Then, he bought 3 additional galetes, so the total number of galetes he has now is: 25 + 3 = 28. Therefore, Paco has menjat more galetes than those he has bought.
Response:  Firstly, En Paco has eaten 2 galetes. Then he bought 36 more galetes. So, in total, En Paco has 38 galetes (2 + 36). Therefore, En Paco has bought more galetes than he has eaten.
Response:  Firstly, we know that en Paco has eaten 40 galetes initially. Then, he has eaten 5 more galetes, so now he has 40 + 5 = 45 galetes in total. Finally, he has given 13 galetes to his friend, leaving him with 45 - 13 = 32 galetes. Therefore, en Paco has 32 galetes left.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 galetes and given 13 to his friend. So he has 17 - 13 = 4 more galetes than he gave away. Therefore, Paco has 4 more galetes than his friend.
Response:  If En Paco has eaten 12 galetes and given 21 to his friend, then he must have had 33 galetes in total (12 + 21 = 33). So, he gave more galetes to his friend than he ate himself.
Response:  At first, Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 savory cookies. If he ate 15 sweet cookies, then he has left 6 (22 - 15) sweet cookies. Similarly, if he ate 54 savory cookies, then he has left 21 (75 - 54) savory cookies. So, Paco has 6 sweet cookies and 21 savory cookies left.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 savory cookies, so he had a total of 15 cookies (9 + 6 = 15). Then, he ate 36 sweet cookies, which means that he ate all of them (36 = 100%). So, he has none left (0). Now, let's check how many savory cookies he has left. He ate 3 savory cookies, but he started with 6, so he has 6 - 3 = 3 savory cookies left. Therefore, El Paco has 3 savory cookies left.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 37 galetes dolces and 11 galetes salades, so together he had 48 galetes (37 + 11 = 48). Then, after eating 5 galetes dolces and 2 galetes salades, he had 40 galetes left (48 - 5 - 2 = 40). So, El Paco menjà 5 more galetes dolces than salads. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 8 galetes dolces and 6 galetes salades, so together he had 14 galetes (8 + 6). Then, he ate 20 galetes dolces, which means that he ate all of them (20 = 14), leaving him with none. Next, he ate 34 galetes salades, which is more than the initial amount he had (34 > 6). So, after eating those additional galetes, El Paco had 34 - 6 = 28 galetes salades left. Therefore, El Paco menjaed 34 - 14 = 20 more galetes salades than galetes dolces.
Response:  If El Paco had initially 37 galetes and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 galette left. So, El Paco has 1 galette left.
Response:  If en Paco has eaten 36 galetes and given 14 to his friend, then he has 36 - 14 = 22 galetes left. So, en Paco has 22 galetes left.
Response:  If El Paco has eaten 41 galetes and gave 9 to his friend, then he had 32 galetes left (41 - 9 = 32).  Now, if he ate 18 of those remaining galetes, then he has 14 galetes left (32 - 18 = 14). So, El Paco has menyed more galetes than he gave away to his friend. The difference between the number of galetes he ate and the number he gave away is 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, El Paco menjed 5 more galetes than he gave to his friend.
Response:  If En Paco has eaten 6 galets and gave his friend 30 galetes, then he has given away 30 - 6 = 24 galetes more than he had eaten. So, En Paco has given his friend 24 galetes more than he had eaten.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 97 galetes salades and 34 dolces, so he had in total 97 + 34 = 131 galetes. Then, he ate 15 galetes dolces, which means that he has eaten 15/131 = 0.115 of his total number of galetes (dolces). Now, let's calculate how many galetes dolces he has left: 131 - 0.115 = 129.5 galetes dolces. So, El Paco has 129.5 galetes dolces left.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 26 galetes salades and 17 dolces. If he ate 14 galetes dolces, then he has eaten 14 + 17 = 31 galetes. Now, he has 26 - 31 = -5 galetes salades left (since he ate more dolces than salads). So, El Paco has -5 galetes salades left.
Response:  At first, El Paco had 39 galetes dolces and 6 galetes salades, so together he had 39 + 6 = 45 galetes. Then, he ate 23 galetes salades, which means that now he has 45 - 23 = 22 galetes salades left. Now, he also ate 32 galetes dolces, which means that now he has 22 + 32 = 54 galetes in total. So, El Paco menjat more galetes dolces than galetes salades.
Response:  If El Paco had 40 galetes dolces and 25 galetes salades initially, then he had a total of 65 galetes (40 + 25).  He ate 28 galetes salades, which means that he has left with 37 galetes salades (25 - 28).  Now, he also ate 15 galetes dolces, so he has 62 galetes remaining (37 + 25). Therefore, El Paco menjat more galetes salades than galetes dolces. The difference between the number of galetes salades he ate and the number of galetes dolces he ate is 15 - 15 = 0. So, he menjat no additional galetes salades or dolces.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $7 for her birthday. Then she spent some money and now has $5 left. So, the amount of money Gwen spent can be found by subtracting the amount she has left from the initial amount she received: $7 - $5 = $2. Therefore, Gwen spent $2.
Response:  If Gwen received $10 for her birthday and spent $8 of it, then she has $2 left ($10 - $8 = $2). So, Gwen received $10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mother and then her father gave her $4 more. So, in total, she got $6. Now, if she has spent $3, then she must have had $6 - $3 = $3 left with her.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. If she spent $4, then we can write the equation: Mother's gift = $8 - $4 = $4 Father's gift = $5 + $4 = $9 So, Gwen's mother gave her $4 more than her father.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she must have received $5 more from her father than from her mother (since $5 is equal to $9 - $4). Therefore, Gwen's father gave her $5 more than her mother.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. If she spent $4, then she has $9 left ($5 + $7 - $4). So, Gwen received more money from her mother than from her father. The difference between the amount of money she received from her mother and her father is $3 ($7 - $5 = $3). Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her $3 more than her father did.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother for her birthday. If she spent $6, then she must have received more money from her father than from her mother. So, we can say: Father gave Gwen $5 - $2 = $3 more than Mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 pebbles in his collection and he lost some buttons, then he has 4 pebbles left now. So, he has lost 5 pebbles (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had n balls in his collection and he lost 21 pebbles, then he has n - 21 pebbles left. So, if he currently has 12 pebbles, that means he had n - 21 = 30 pebbles initially. Therefore, Josh had 30 balls in his collection initially.
Response:  If Josh had 19 pebbles in his collection and lost 11 of them, he would have 8 pebbles left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, if he found 5 new pebbles, he would have 13 pebbles in total (8 + 5 = 13). So, Josh has 13 pebbles in his collection now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh had 4 pèls in his collection initially. Then he lost 16 pèls, so he had 4 - 16 = -12 pèls left. Now, he found 8 new pèls, so he had -12 + 8 = 6 pèls left. Therefore, Josh lost more pèls than he found, so he had 4 - 6 = -2 pèls less than he started with.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 7 bolts in his collection and lost 8 of them, so he was left with -8 = 9 bolts. Then, he found 10 new bolts, so he now has 9 + 10 = 19 bolts. Therefore, the number of bolts that Josh found is 19 - 8 = 11 more than the number he lost.
Response:  If Josh had 21 pebbles in his collection and he found 7 mushrooms, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 pebbles left in his collection. So, Josh tiene 14 pebols ara.
Response:  If Josh had 20 marbles in his collection and he gave two to Jack, then Josh has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. So, Josh has 18 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh had 22 pebbles in his collection and Jack gave him 20 pebbles, then Josh has 22 - 20 = 2 pebbles left in his collection. So, Josh has 2 pebbles now.
Response:  If Josh had 19 hairs before and lost 11 of them, then he has 8 remaining hairs now (19 - 11 = 8). So, he has 8 hairs in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had 22 pebbles in his collection and he found 13 for one person, then he has 9 pebbles left (22 - 13 = 9).  And if he lost 5 pebbles, then he has 4 pebbles left (9 - 5 = 4). So, Josh now has 4 pebbles in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 mushrooms in his collection and he found 9 of them, then he has 6 (15 - 9) mushrooms left.  Now, if he lost 23 mushrooms, then he has X mushrooms left, where X is equal to 6 minus the number of mushrooms he lost. So, X = 6 - 23 = -17. Therefore, Josh lost 17 mushrooms more than he found.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 3 mushrooms in his collection and found 6 more for one of them. So, he now has 3 + 6 = 9 mushrooms. Then, he lost 5 mushrooms. Therefore, the final number of mushrooms Josh has is 9 - 5 = 4 mushrooms.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to collect fruit together. In total, their fruit weighed 4 kilograms. We also know that Marco's fruit weighed 5 kilograms more than his father's. So, if his father's fruit weighed x kilograms, then Marco's fruit would have weighed x + 5 kilograms. Therefore, the difference in weight between Marco's fruit and his father's fruit is 5 kilograms.
Response:  We know that in total, Marco and his father collected 15 kilograms of fruit. If Marco's fruit weighed 4 kilograms, then his father's fruit must have weighed 11 kilograms (15 - 4 = 11). Therefore, Marco's father's fruit weighed 11 kilograms more than Marco's fruit.
Response:  We know that the total weight of fruits collected by both Marco and his father is 37 kilograms (20 + 17 = 37). Since Marco alone collected 20 kilograms of fruit, we can calculate his share as follows:  Marco's share of fruit = Total weight of fruit / Number of people collecting fruit = 37 kg / 2 = 18.5 kg. Therefore, Marco's fruits weighed 18.5 kilograms.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to collect fruit together. The weight of Marco's fruit is 8 kg, while his father's fruit weighs 32 kg. So, if Marco's fruit weighed 8 kg, then his father's fruit must have weighed x kg, where x is the difference between 8 kg and 32 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marco's fruit = 8 kg.
Response:  We know that En Marco and his father together collected 24 kilograms of fruit (freses). On their way back home, Marco lost 3 kilograms of fruit, so he had 3 kg - 3 = 0 kg of fruit left. Therefore, the weight of Marco's remaining fruit is zero kilograms. Now, we need to find out how much fruit his father had originally. Since the total weight of all the fruit they collected was 24 kilograms, and Marco lost 3 kilograms, the weight of his father's original share must be equal to 24 kg - 3 kg = 21 kilograms. So, the weight of his father's original fruit was 21 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, we know that En Marco and his father together collected 15 kilograms of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, En Marco's father lost 2 kilograms of strawberries. So, now En Marco has 4 kilograms of strawberries left. Therefore, the weight of strawberries left with En Marco's father is 15 - 2 = 13 kilograms.
Response:  Firstly, En Marco and his father together collected 22 kilograms of fruits. Then, on their way back, En Marco's father found additional 30 kilograms of fruits. So, now En Marco has 10 kilograms of fruits left with him. Therefore, the total weight of fruits that En Marco's father had is 22 + 30 = 52 kilograms.
Response:  If Marco and his father went to collect fruit together and Marco's fruit weighed 5 kg, then his father's fruit must have weighed x kg, where x is the difference between 37 kg and 5 kg = 32 kg. Therefore, the weight of his father's fruit is 32 kg.
Response:  If Marco and his father went to collect fruit together, then they must have collected a total of 47 kilograms (30 + 17) of fruit. So, if Marco's fruit weighed 17 kilograms less than his father's, then his father's fruit must have weighed 47 - 17 = 30 kilograms. Therefore, Marco's fruit weighed 30 kilograms more than his father's fruit.
Response:  If Marco and his father went to collect fruit together, and Marco's fruit weighed 5 kilograms, then his father's fruit must have weighed more than 5 kilograms - otherwise they would not have been able to accumulate 10 kilograms in total. So, if Marco's fruit weighs 5 kilograms, then his father's fruit must weigh at least 5 + 5 = 10 kilograms. Therefore, the weight of his father's fruit is twice that of Marco's fruit.
Response:  If Marco's father's fruit weighed 4 kg and Marco's fruit weighs 30 kg, then Marco's fruit must have weighed 75 kg (30 - 4 = 75).
Response:  Before stopping at the bus stop, there were two children in the bus. So, the number of children in the bus was 2 + 2 = 4.  When more children got on the bus after stopping, the total number of children in the bus became 4 + X, where X is the number of new children who got on the bus. Since there are 10 children in total now, we can write the equation: 4 + X = 10. Solving for X, we get: X = 6. Therefore, there are 6 additional children in the bus now compared to before the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children traveling in the bus. Then, at the bus stop, 38 more children got on the bus. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  Before the stop, there were 3 nens in the bus. When two more children got on at the stop, there were 5 children in total (including the original 3). So, before the stop, there were 3 + 5 = 8 children in the bus.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus and after some of them got off at the stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, we can say that 22 children got off the bus (43 - 21 = 22).
Response:  Before the stop, there were 41 children in the bus. When some of them got off at the stop, there were 18 children left in the bus. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number and the final number, which is 23 (41 - 18). Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus at the stop while 3 other children got on the bus. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Therefore, 3 children got on the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children in the bus and then some more got off at stop 63 while some others boarded the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus after stop 63 is:  Initially = 5 + (some who got off) - (some who boarded) = 14 Children now in the bus. Since we are asked how many more children boarded than got off, we can write: Number of children who boarded = Number of children who got off + 0 = 14 - 5 = 9 Therefore, 9 more children boarded the bus than got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and after some children got off at the stop, there were 12 children left in the bus. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 36 - x = 12 where 'x' represents the number of children who got off the bus. Now, we are asked how many more children got off than climbed onto the bus. This means we need to subtract the number of children who climbed onto the bus from the number of children who got off. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows: x - y =? where 'y' represents the number of children who climbed onto the bus. Now, we have two equations: 36 - x = 12 and x - y =? To solve for 'y', we can add the two equations together: 36 - x + x - y = 12 + x - y Substituting the value of 'x' from the first equation into the second equation gives us: 48 = 2x - y Solving for 'y', we get: y = 24 So, 24 children climbed onto the bus. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who climbed onto the bus is 24.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 children got on the bus while some got off. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 22 - 40 = -18.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 8 more got in while some got off. So, the number of children who got in is equal to the number of children who got off. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children is equal to the number of children who got in.  Now we can calculate this difference as follows:  Initially, there were 28 children in the bus, so the difference between the initial and final numbers of children is:  Final number of children - Initial number of children = 30 - 28 = 2.  Therefore, 2 children got in the bus while 1 child got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children in the bus and then 24 children got on the bus while some got off. So, the total number of children in the bus after some got off is given by: Total = Initial - Number who got off.  Now, we are asked how many children got off the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation: Total = Initial - Number who got off. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total = 23 - x Where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Since 8 children got off the bus, we have: x = 8. Therefore, the correct answer is: Total = 23 - 8 = 15.
"Response:  We know that the baker made 133 pastries and sold 51 of them. So, we have to find out how many more pastries the baker made than those he sold. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of pastries made = Number of pastries sold + Number of extra pastries made (where ""extra"" means the ones not sold) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pastries made = 133 + X Where X is the number of extra pastries made (i.e., the number of pastries not sold). Since the baker sold 51 pastries, the number of extra pastries made must be equal to 51 - 51 = 0. Therefore, the baker made exactly as many pastries as he sold! So, the answer is 0."
Response:  We know that the baker made 54 pastries and sold some of them. So, there are still 13 pastries left. To find out how many pastries the baker sold, we can divide the number of pastries he had left (13) by the number of pastries he sold ( unknown). Therefore, the answer is 13/x = 13 pastries sold where x is the number of pastries the baker sold.
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 145 pastries and still has 72 left. So, if he made x pastries, then we can write an equation as follows: 145 + x = 217 (since there are 217 pastries in total). Now, we solve for x using subtraction: x = 217 - 145 = 72. Therefore, the baker made 72 pastries.
"Response:  If the baker made 155 pastries and his friend bought 140 of them, then the number of pastries left with the baker is:

$$ Number \ of \ pastries \ left = Total \ number \ of \ pastries - Number \ of \ pastries \ bought $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ Number \ of \ pastries \ left = 155 - 140 = 15 $$

Therefore, the baker has 15 pastries left."
Response:  The baker made 121 pastries and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) left. Then, he bought 170 new pastries, so now he has 16 + 170 = 186 pastries in total. Therefore, the baker still has 186 pastries.
Response:  The baker made 13 pastries and sold 9 of them. So he has 4 left (13 - 9 = 4). Then, he bought 154 new pastries. To find out how many more pastries he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the number of pastries he bought: 154 - 9 = 145. Therefore, the baker bought 145 more pastries than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 170 pastries and sold 78 of them. So he had 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new ones. Now, he has 63 pastries left (92 - 31 = 63), which is more than the number of pastries he sold (78). Therefore, the baker sold fewer pastries than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 pastries and sold 75 of them. Then he made another 76 pastries. So far, the total number of pastries the baker has made is: 110 + 76 = 186 pastries. Therefore, the baker still has 110 - 75 = 35 pastries left to sell or consume.
Response:  The baker made 144 pastries and sold 71 of them. Then he made 111 more pastries. So, in total, the baker made 255 pastries (144 + 111). Therefore, the number of pastries that the baker did not sell is 255 - 71 = 184 pastries.
Response:  If the baker made 149 pastries and sold 10 of them, he has 139 left (149 - 10 = 139).  If he then made 91 more pastries and sold 90 of them, he has 2 left (91 - 90 = 2). So, the baker now has 2 pastries left.
Response:  If the baker made 7 pans of pastries and sold 15 pastries, then he has 7 - 15 = 9 remaining pans of pastries.  If he also sold 103 pastries, then he has 9 + 103 = 112 remaining pastries. Therefore, the baker has 112 pastries left.
Response:  The panadère made 126 + 48 = 174 pastries in total.  He sold 115 + 81 = 196 pastries. So, he made more pastries than he sold. In other words, he had X pastries left over after selling them. Since he made 174 pastries and sold 196 pastries, X = 174 - 196 = -22 pastries. Therefore, the panadère made 22 more pastries than he sold.
Response:  The panader made 19 + 131 = 150 pastries in total. He sold 70 + 88 = 158 pastries. So, the panader made more pastries than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of pastries made and the number of pastries sold is equal to the number of pastries made minus the number of pastries sold. In this case, that would be: 150 - 158 = -8 pastries.  Hence, the panader made -8 pastries more than he sold.
Response:  The panader made 157 + 169 = 326 pastries in total.  He sold 158 + 147 = 305 pastries. So, the panader sold more pastries than he made.
Response:  The panader made 54 + 143 = 197 pastries in total. He sold 68 + 92 = 160 pastries. So, the panader sold more than he made. In fact, he sold 37 (160 - 197) more pastries than he made.
Response:  If the baker had initially made 48 pastries and sold 44 of them, then he has 4 left over. So, the number of pastries the baker has is 4.
Response:  If the baker had initially made 40 pastries and sold 8 of them, then he must have made additional pastries to reach that number. So, we can say that the baker made (40 - 8) = 32 more pastries than he sold. Therefore, the answer is 32.
Response:  If he had made 169 puffs initially and sold them all to the baker, then the baker would have bought 169 x $ 2 = $ 338 worth of puffs from him. Since the baker bought 137 puffs from him, it means that the remaining puffs are equal to $ 338 - $ 137 = $ 201. So, the baker still has $ 201 worth of puffs left with him.
Response:  The panadero (baker) made 173 pastries and bought 103 new ones. So, he has 70 pastries left from what he already had (173 - 103 = 69). Then, he sold 86 pastries, so now he has 69 - 86 = 23 pastries left. Therefore, the baker has 23 pastries left.
Response:  The baker made 99 pastries and bought 167 new ones. So, he has 167 - 99 = 68 more pastries than he sold. Therefore, the baker bought 167 - 89 = 78 more pastries than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 8 pizzas and bought 139 new ones. He sold 145 pizzas in total. So, we need to find out how many more pizzas he sold than he bought. To do this, we can subtract the number of pizzas he bought from the number of pizzas he sold:  Number of pizzas sold - Number of pizzas bought = 145 - 139 = 6 Therefore, the baker sold 6 more pizzas than he bought.
Response:  Firstly, the baker made 62 pastries and then he made 149 more. So in total, he made 62 + 149 = 211 pastries. Now, he sold 144 of them. Therefore, the number of pastries left with the baker is 211 - 144 = 67 pastries.
Response:  The baker made 81 pastries first and then made 92 more. He sold 46 of them. So, the number of pastries the baker made but did not sell is:  Pastries made - Sold = 92 - 46 = 46  Therefore, the baker made 46 more pastries than he sold.
Response:  We know that the baker made 61 + 167 = 228 pastries in total. If he sold 108 pastries and 44 pastries, then we have to subtract these numbers from the total number of pastries he made. So, the number of pastries left with the baker is: 228 - (108 + 44) = 46 pastries. Therefore, the baker has 46 pastries left.
Response:  If the baker made 56 + 124 = 180 pastries in total and he sold 104 + 29 = 133 pastries, then the number of pastries left with the baker is 180 - 133 = 47 pastries. Therefore, the baker has 47 pastries left.
Response:  The panadère made 52 + 84 = 136 pastries in total. If he sold 102 and 94 pastries, then he had to make more than these numbers of pastries. So, we can say that the number of pastries the panadère made is equal to the difference between the total number of pastries he made and the number of pastries he sold: 136 - (102 + 94) = 40 pastries. Therefore, the panadère made 40 additional pastries beyond what he sold.
Response:  The panadère made 134 + 11 = 145 pastries in total. He sold 140 + 92 = 232 pastries. So, he made more pastries than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of pastries he made and the number of pastries he sold is: 145 - 232 = -87 pastries.
Response:  We know that the panadère made 14 + 153 = 167 pastries in total.  If he sold 8 pastries and 97 pastries, then he sold a total of 8 + 97 = 105 pastries. So, the panadère sold more pastries than he made.
Response:  The panader made 43 + 114 = 157 pastries. He sold 154 + 78 = 232 pastries. So, the panader sold more pastries than he made.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games of Nintendo and wants to have 140 total games, he needs to buy more games. We can calculate how many games he needs to buy as follows:

Number of games Kelly already has = 22
Desired number of games = 140 - 22 = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 games to reach his desired total of 140 games."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games of Nintendo and he gives away 64 games, then he will have left 106 - 64 = 42 games.
Response:  Initially, there were 91 games of Nintendo that Kelly had. If she still has 92 games left, then initially there must have been 93 games in total (91 + 92 = 93). Therefore, the number of initial games was 93.
Response:  Kelly has 20 games of Nintendo and wants to have 12 left after giving some away. So we need to subtract 12 from 20. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 8 games of Nintendo (20 - 12 = 8).
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and 132 games from Sony. To find out how many games of Sony he needs to give away to have 31 games in total, we can divide the number of games of Sony he has (132) by the number of games he wants to have in total (31). So, Kelly needs to give away 40 games of Sony (132 / 31 = 40) to have 31 games of Sony in total.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and found 31 more, then he now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games of Nintendo. To find out how many games he needs to have in order to have 6 different games, we can divide 111 by 6: 111 / 6 = 18. So, Kelly needs to have at least 18 different games of Nintendo in his collection.
Response:  If Randy had initially 52 blocks and he used them to build a tower, then he must have had X blocks left after building the tower. Since he has 38 blocks left now, we can write the equation:  X - 38 = 52. Solving for X, we get: X = 14. So, Randy had 14 blocks at first.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks to build his tower and he uses all of them up. So, if there are 72 remaining blocks after building the tower, then we can say that Randy used 97 - 72 = 25 blocks to construct the tower. Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total. If he uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house, then we have:
Blocks used for the tower = 14 Blocks used for the house = 11 Total number of blocks used = 14 + 11 = 25 So, there are 79 - 25 = 54 blocks left over after building the tower and the house."
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total.  He used 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So, he used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks to build both the tower and the house together. Therefore, Randy used 80 blocks in total to construct his building project.
Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks in total. He used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So, we can write this as: 33 + 13 = 46. Therefore, Randy used more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks in total. He used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So, we can write:  Blocks needed for the tower = 86 - 79 = 8  Blocks needed for the house = 82 Therefore, Randy used more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower. The difference is 8 - 8 = 0 blocks.
Response:  If Randy has 59 blocks and he uses 36 blocks to build each tower, then he will have used 59 / 36 = 16 towers. So, he will have 59 - 16 = 43 blocks left.
Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks in total and he used 20 blocks to build a house. Therefore, he had 75 blocks left (95 - 20 = 75). Now we are asked how many more blocks he used to build the tower than for the house. So, let's compare the number of blocks used for each structure: Tower: 50 blocks House: 20 blocks To find out how many more blocks were used for the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks available: 75 blocks - 20 blocks = 55 blocks Therefore, Randy used 55 blocks more to build the tower than he did for the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks to build something.  He uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write: House = 89 blocks Tower = 63 blocks Now, let's compare how many blocks he used for each one: Number of blocks used in the house = 89 blocks Used in the tower = 63 blocks blocks Therefore, Randy used more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower. The difference is: Number of blocks used in the house - Number of blocks used in the tower = 89 - 63 = 26 blocks
Response:  If there are 20 books in total and you have not read 5 of them yet, that means you have already read 15 books. So, the number of books you have read is 15.
"Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series ""School of Witches and Wizards"" and still need to read 8 more books, then there are 8 + 13 = 21 books in total in the series."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and you have read 12 of them. So, the number of books left to read is: 22 - 12 = 10.  Similarly, we know that there are 10 movies in total and you have watched 56 of them. So, the number of movies left to watch is: 10 - 56 = -46. Therefore, you still have 10 books to read and 46 movies to watch.
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series. If you have read 19 books and seen 7 movies, then we can deduce that you still need to see 10 more movies. Therefore, the answer is 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"". If you have read 19 books and seen 13 movies, then we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series as follows:

Number of books - Number of movies = Total number of books + Movies
= 19 - 13 = 6

So, there are 6 more books than movies in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series ""Escola de Bojos i Bojos"". If you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series as follows:

Movies - Books = (61 - 19) = 42

So, there are 42 more movies than books in the series ""Escola de Bojos i Bojos""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series. If you have read 13 books and seen 12 movies, then we can deduce that you have not read any of the additional 7 books (since you mentioned you have only read 13). Therefore, the number of books you have not read is 7. Similarly, since you have seen 12 movies but were asked how many more movies you have seen than books, we can conclude that you have not seen any of the additional 9 movies (again, since you mentioned you have only seen 12). So, the number of movies you have not seen is also 9. In summary, you have read 7 books and not seen 9 movies.
"Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series, that means we have a total of:

Books = 11
Movies = 17

If you have read 7 books, then you have not seen any movies yet. So, the number of movies you have seen is:

Movies seen = 0

Now, let's find out how many more movies you need to see to catch up with the number of books you have read:

Number of movies to see = Books - Movies seen
= 11 - 0
= 11

Therefore, if you have read 7 books, you still need to watch 4 movies (11 - 0 = 11) to catch up with your reading."
"Response:  We know that the person has read 8 books from the series ""Escola de Bojos i Bojos"". If there are a total of 14 books in the series, then we can calculate how many more books the person needs to read as follows: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 - 8 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more books left for the person to read."
Response:  We know that there are 62 movies and 19 books in the series. If you have seen 34 movies, then you still need to watch 28 more movies (62 - 34 = 28). Now, let's assume that you want to read all the books as well. There are 19 books in total, so if you have read 4 of them, then you still need to read 15 more books (19 - 4 = 15). Therefore, the number of books you still need to read is 15.
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies in total and you have seen 4 of them. So, we need to find out how many movies you still haven't seen. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of movies left = Total number of movies - Movies watched = 8 - 4 = 4 Therefore, you have 4 more movies to watch from the series.
Response:  If there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series, that means there are 14 + 15 = 29 different works in total.  If you have read 11 books and watched 40 movies, then you still haven't seen all of the works in the series. Therefore, there are at least 29 - 11 = 18 more books than movies in the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"". If you have seen 63 movies and read 13 books, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series as follows:

Movies - Books = (63 - 13) = 50

So, there are 50 more movies than books in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Wizardry""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books in the series and you have read 14 of them. So, we can say that you have not read 6 books (the difference between the number of books you have read and the total number of books). Now, let's move to the movies. You have seen 6 movies out of 6 different ones, so you have not seen any other movie than the ones you mentioned. Therefore, the number of movies you have watched is equal to the number of movies you mentioned (6).  In conclusion, if you have read 14 books and seen 6 movies from the series, then you have not read or seen any additional book or movie from the series.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the series and you have read 19 of them. So, we can say that you have not read 11 books from the series (8 - 19 = 11). Now, let's consider the movies. There are 5 movies in the series and you have seen 5 of them. Therefore, you have not seen 3 movies from the series (5 - 16 = 3). In conclusion, you have read 11 books more than you have watched movies from the series.
Response:  If Dave had won seven tickets and used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least two tickets for that purpose. So, if he still has two entries left, it means he used five tickets to buy toys. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Dave had won $12 entries and used them to buy toys, then he has $12 - 12 = $0 left in the arcade. So, he has $0 / 14 = 0.7143 (approximately) entries remaining in the arcade.
Response:  If Dave has won 18 entries and he used 5 to buy games, then he has 13 remaining entries (18 - 5 = 13).  Then, if he uses 11 more to buy clothes, he will have 2 entries left (13 - 11 = 2). So, Dave has 2 entries left after buying both games and clothes.
Response:  If Dave has won 19 entries and he used 12 to buy toys, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 entries left. Now, if he uses 7 more entries to buy clothes, then he will have 0 entries left. So, Dave used more entries to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 entries and he used 8 of them to buy toys, then he has 5 entries left (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he wants to use some of these remaining entries to buy clothes, how many can he afford to buy? Well, we know that he has 18 more entries than he used for toys, so he can afford to buy 18 x 2 = 36 units of clothing. Therefore, Dave used 36 more units of clothing than he did toys.
Response:  If Dave has won $14 and lost $2, he now has $14 - $2 = $12.  He used $10 to buy toys, so he has $12 - $10 = $2 left. Therefore, Dave has 2 entries left.
Response:  We know that Haley had 14 trees in her garden before the hurricane. If 9 of them died as a result of the hurricane, then we have to subtract 9 from 14 to find out how many survived. So, the number of trees that survived is 5 (14 - 9).
Response:  We know that Haley had 13 trees in her garden before the hurricane. After the hurricane, we are told that 6 of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is equal to the original number minus the number of dead trees. In this case, it would be: Surviving trees = Original number - Dead trees = 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees survived the hurricane.
Response:  If Haley had planted 20 trees in her garden and after the hurricane (tifón), only four trees remained, then we can conclude that 16 trees died during the hurricane. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Hailey planted 12 trees in her garden and after 5 years, she died due to a hurricane, then there are no new trees that have grown in her garden since then. So, the number of trees left behind is still 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response: 1) Haley plants 9 trees in her garden. So far, she has 9 trees. 2) A tsunami kills 4 of them. Now there are 9 - 4 = 5 trees left. 3) After that, Haley plants 5 more trees. So now there are 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total. Therefore, Haley has 10 trees left in her garden.
"Response:  If initially there were 12 trees in Haley's garden and two of them died after the hurricane, then the number of surviving trees is:

12 - 2 = 10

So, there are 10 trees left in Haley's garden after the hurricane."
Response:  If initially there were 3 trees that survived the storm and 10 more died in the storm than survived, then we can write an equation as follows:  Surviving Trees = Initial Number of Trees - (Number of Trees That Died in Storm / Total Number of Trees)  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Surviving Trees = 3 - (13 / 16) = 3 - 2/3 = 2  Therefore, 2 trees died in the storm beyond those that survived.
Response:  We know that initially there were 11 trees in Haley's garden and after the hurricane, two of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, three more trees survived than died.
"Response:  If after Desprès went to see how many tangerines were collected per day and found that they collected 66 bags per day, then we can deduce that each bag contains 28 tangerines. So, if there are 66 bags per day, then the number of tangerines collected per day is:

$$ Number \ of \ tangerines = Total \ number \ of \ bags \ times \ number \ of \ tangerines \ in \ each \ bag $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ Number \ of \ tangerines = 66 \ times \ 28 $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ Number \ of \ tangerines = 1840 $$

Therefore, the number of tangerines collected per day is $1840$."
Response:  If they collect 8 bags per day, it means that in one week (7 days) they will collect: 8 x 7 = 56 bags. To collect 24 bags of oranges, it will take them approximately: 24 / 56 = 0.43 days. So, it will take them around 0.43 days to collect 24 bags of oranges.
"Response:  If Desprès goes to see the oranges that are being collected and discovers that the harvest will last for 4 days, then we can calculate how many bags of oranges he collects per day as follows:

Total number of bags of oranges = Total number of bags of oranges / Number of days of the harvest
= 56 bags of oranges / 4 days
= 14 bags of oranges per day

Therefore, Desprès collects 14 bags of oranges per day."
Response:  After 49 days of collection, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 sacs of oranges. So, they will have 1752 x 42 = 76052 tarnges in total.
Response:  After 87 days of collection, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 sacs of oranges. Since each sac contains 25 oranges, we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows: Number of oranges = Total number of sacs x Number of oranges per sac = 5904 x 25 = 147,500 oranges. Therefore, after 87 days of collection, they will have 147,500 oranges.
"Response:  We know that after Desprès went to see how many tangerines were collected per day. So we can write down the information given in the question as follows:

* Number of bags collected per day = 8
* Number of tangerines in each bag = 35

Now, let's calculate the total number of tangerines collected per day:
Total number of tangerines collected per day = Number of bags collected per day x Number of tangerines in each bag
= 8 x 35
= 280

Therefore, the answer is 280 tangerines collected per day."
Response:  If they collect 16 sacs per day and each sac contains 57 tomatoes, then in one day they will collect 16 x 57 = 904 tomatoes. To collect 80 sacs of tomatoes, it will take them 80 / 904 = 8.83 days. Therefore, it will take them approximately 8 days and 12 hours to collect 80 sacs of tomatoes.
Response:  We know that after Desprès went to see how many tarragon were collected, he found out that they collected 67 bags per day and each bag contains 12 tarragons. So, if they collect a total of 35 bags of tarragon, we can calculate the number of tarragon as follows: Number of tarragon = Total number of bags x Number of tarragons in each bag  Number of tarragon = 35 bags x 12 tarragons/bag  Number of tarragon = 420 tarragons
Response:  After 51 days of collection, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3650 sacs of oranges. Since they discard 71 sacs per day, after 51 days they will have 3650 - 71 x 51 = 2989 sacs of oranges left to collect.
Response:  If they collect 76 sacs per day and discard 64, that means they have collected 12 more sacs than they have discarded. So, if they collect x sacs of oranges per day, then they will discard x - 64 = 62 sacs per day. Now we know that each bag contains 50 oranges, so the total number of oranges collected per day is 50x = 6200 oranges per day. Therefore, there are 6200 oranges collected per day.
Response:  After 26 days of collection, we know that the total number of bags collected per day is 28 + 52 = 80 bags. So, in 26 days, the total number of bags collected will be 80 x 26 = 2040 bags. Therefore, after 26 days of collecting taronges, they will have collected 2040 bags of taronges.
Response:  After 25 days of collection, we know that the total number of bags of oranges collected per day is 82 + 61 = 143 bags. Since the proportion of mature and immature oranges remains constant during the collection period, we can assume that the number of bags of mandarin oranges collected per day will also be equal to 143. Therefore, after 25 days of collection, the total number of bags of mandarin oranges collected will be: 143 x 25 = 3575 bags.
Response:  After 45 days of collection, we know that there are 24 sacs of unripe oranges collected per day. Since each orange takes 45 days to ripen, in total, after 45 days of collection, there will be 24 x 45 = 1080 unripe oranges collected. Therefore, the number of unripe taronges not madures after 45 days of collection is 1080.
Response:  We know that after Desprès went to see how many oranges were collected per day:  Adult oranges = 44 bags per day Non-mature oranges = 25 bags per day So, if we want to find out how many more mature oranges are collected than immature ones per day, we can use the following equation: Number of mature oranges collected per day - Number of non-mature oranges collected per day = Number of mature oranges collected more than non-mature oranges per day Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of mature oranges collected per day - Number of non-mature oranges collected per day = 44 - 25 = 19 Therefore, there are 19 more mature oranges collected than non-mature oranges collected per day.
"Response:  We know that Desprès went to see how many oranges were being collected and found out that they were collecting 5 bags of mature oranges and 74 bags of unripe oranges per day. So, we can write this as:

Number of bags of mature oranges = 5
Number of bags of unripe oranges = 74

Now, we want to find out how many more bags of unripe oranges are collected than mature oranges. To do this, we can subtract the number of bags of mature oranges from the total number of bags of oranges collected:

Total number of bags of oranges collected - Number of bags of mature oranges = 74 - 5 = 69

So, there are 69 more bags of unripe oranges collected than mature oranges per day."
"Response:  If they collected 54 bags of oranges in total and they were collecting 18 bags per day, then it took them:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of bags}}{\text{Daily collection}} $$

So, the number of days it took to collect all those oranges is:

$$ \boxed {54 \div 18 = 3} $$

Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all those oranges."
Response:  If they collected 56 sacs of oranges in one day and they collected for 14 days, then the total number of bags collected is:  Total number of bags = Number of bags per day x Number of days collecting = 56 x 14 = 780 bags
Response:  After 73 days of collection, we know that they collect 5 bags of ripe tomatoes per day. So in total, they will have collected 5 x 73 = 365 bags of ripe tomatoes.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, we know that they collected 65 + 46 = 111 sacs of mature and immature oranges per day. Since they collect 65 sacs of immature oranges per day, after 6 days of collection, they will have collected 65 x 6 = 390 sacs of immature oranges. Therefore, the number of sacs of immature oranges not yet collected is 111 - 390 = -279 sacs.
"Response:  We know that after Desprès went to see how many bags of oranges were being collected, he found out that they were collecting 41 bags of immature oranges and 86 bags of mature oranges per day. So, we can write this as:

41 + 86 = 127

Now, we want to find out how many more bags of mature oranges are collected than immature oranges. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bags of immature oranges from the total number of bags collected:

127 - 41 = 86

So, there are 86 more bags of mature oranges collected than immature oranges each day."
Response:  If desprès went to see how many bags of oranges were collected and found that they collected 71 bags of immature oranges and 60 bags of mature oranges per day, then we can deduce that the total number of bags of oranges collected per day is equal to the sum of the number of bags of immature oranges plus the number of bags of mature oranges. Therefore, the number of bags of unripe oranges collected per day is 71 + 60 = 131 bags. So, the number of bags of ripe oranges collected per day is 131 - 60 = 71 bags.
Response:  Length = 4 meters Width = 3 meters Now we need to find out how much longer is the length than the width. We can do this by subtracting the width from the length: Length - Width = 4 - 3 = 1 meter So, the length of Jesse's room is 1 meter more than its width.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse's room is 2 meters long. Therefore, its length in feet can be calculated as follows:  $ \text{Length} = 2 \text{ meters} \times 3.28084 \text{ feet/meter} = 6.56176 \text{ feet}$  Next, we are given that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 14 square feet. To find out how wide this rug needs to be, we divide the area required by the length of the room:  $ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{14 \text{ square feet}}{6.56176 \text{ feet}} = 2.1958 \text{ feet}$  So, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 2.1958 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse's room is 2 meters wide. Therefore, its length can be calculated as follows: Length = Width x Height = 2 m x 3 m = 6 m Now, we are given that Jesse needs a carpet of 14 square feet area to cover his room. Since there are 0.1 square meters in one square foot, we can convert the area of the carpet as follows: Area of carpet = 14 sq ft = 0.14 sq m So, now we have the area of the carpet and the length of the room. To find out the length of the room, we divide the area of the carpet by its width: Length = Area of carpet / Width = 0.14 sq m / 2 m = 7 m Thereby, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 7 meters or 23 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the area of the room is given as 12 meters squared (m^2).  Therefore, to find out how many square meters of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor, we can use the following formula: Area of carpet = Total area of room - Area already covered by carpet.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Area of carpet = 12 m^2 - 4 m^2 = 8 m^2.  So, 8 square meters of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor of Jesse's room.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet are in one meter and half of length and width of the room. We can do this by multiplying the length and width in meters. So, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = (1 x 2) + (0.5 x 3) = 6 + 1.5 = 7.5 square meters. Now, we know that each rack has an area of 4 square feet, so we can divide the total area of the room by the area of each rack to get the number of racks needed to cover the entire floor: Number of Racks = Total Area / Area of Each Rack = 7.5 / 4 = 1.875 racks. Since you cannot have a fraction of a rack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 2 racks. Therefore, Jesse needs 2 racks to cover the entire floor.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each room has an area of 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since there are 20 rooms in total, their combined area is 20 x 36 = 720 square meters. Now, since the ceiling height is also 6 meters, we need to calculate the volume of the entire floor. The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 6 x 6 x 6 = 1080 cubic meters. Therefore, the amount of carpet needed to cover all floors would be approximately 1080 / 10 = 108 square meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the width of Jesse's room is equal to its length (6 meters). So, we can write: L = W. Now, we are asked how much longer Jesse's room is than its width. To find this difference, we subtract the width from the length: D = L - W. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: D = 6 - 6 = 0 meters. Therefore, Jesse's room is as long as it is wide.
Response:  We know that the area of the carpet is equal to the length times the width, so we can write an equation like this: Area = Length x Width. Since we are given that the length of the room is 1.5 meters and we want to find out how wide it is, we can substitute this value into our equation: Area = 1.5 x Width. Now we have a problem where we need to solve for the width (in meters). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: Width = Area / 1.5. Finally, since we were asked to find the width in meters, we will give our answer in units of meters: Width = 3 / 1.5 = 2 meters. So, the width of La Jesse's bedroom is approximately 2 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the area of the carpet needed is 3 square meters and the width of the room is 1.5 meters. So, we can calculate the length of the room as follows: Area of the room = Width x Length = 1.5 x Length Therefore, the length of the room is 3 meters (since the area is 3 square meters).
Response:  We know that Jesse has 6 meters squared of carpets and his room is 1 meter long and 6 meters wide. To cover the entire floor, we need to calculate how much space the carpet will take up based on its dimensions. The formula for this calculation is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length is 1 meter and the width is 6 meters, so the area of the carpet needed to cover the entire floor is: Area = 1 x 6 = 6 square meters. Therefore, Jesse needs 6 meters squared of carpet to cover the entire floor of his room.
Response:  We know that Razorback wins $23 for each t-shirt sold and during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech they sold $230 worth of t-shirts. To find out how many t-shirts were sold we can divide the amount of money earned by the profit per t-shirt: $$ \frac { 230 } { 23} = 10 $$ So, there were 10 t-shirts sold.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by the store is $51 and they sold 3 shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Amount = Number of Shirts x Price Per Shirt Therefore, we need to find out what was the price of each shirt in order to solve for it. According to the question, the price of each shirt was $17. So, we can substitute this value into our previous equation: Total Amount = Number of Shirts x Price Per Shirt Total Amount = 3 x $17 Total Amount = $51 Now we have found the price of each shirt, which is $17.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold a total of 95 shirts. If they sold 47 shirts during the Arkansas game, then we can find out how much money they made from selling those shirts by subtracting the number of shirts sold during the Texas Tech game from the total number of shirts sold: $$ = \text {Number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game} - \text{Total number of shirts sold}$$ $$= 47 - 95$$ $$= -50$$ So, according to the information provided in the question, Razorbacks lost $50 for each shirt sold during the Arkansas game.
Response:  During the game of Arkansas, they sold 106$ per shirt. So, if they sold x shirts during the Texas Tech game, then the revenue from those shirts would be 106x dollars. Since there were 242 shirts sold in total, we can set up the equation: 106x = 24200. Solving for x gives us x = 218. Therefore, they sold 218 shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold a total of 163 shirts. If they sold 89 shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make selling shirts during the Arkansas game? So, we have to find out how many dollars they made from selling shirts during the Arkansas game. To do this, we need to divide the number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game by the price of each shirt (which is $98). Therefore, if they sold 89 shirts during the Arkansas game, they made $8,524 ($98 x 89) in revenue from those shirts alone.
Response:  During the game of Arkansas, they sold 172 samarretes and earned $78 per each one, so they earned a total of $13,040 ($78 x 172).  Now, during the game of Texas Tech, they sold an additional 186 samarretes. If they sold 172 samarretes during the game of Arkansas, then they sold 14 more (186 - 172) samarretes during the game of Texas Tech. So, they earned $78 x 14 = $1,092 extra during the game of Texas Tech. Therefore, their total earnings from selling samarretes were $13,040 + $1,092 = $14,132.
Response:  We know that the store Razorback makes $62 for each t-shirt and $99 for each hoodie. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 hoodies. So how much money did they make from selling these shirts? To find out, we need to multiply the number of shirts sold by the amount the store makes per shirt. In this case, that would be: $62 x 183 = $11,546 $99 x 31 = $3,079 Total: $14,625 Therefore, the store made $14,625 from selling t-shirts during the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the store made $67 per each Razorback shirt and $165 for each Texas Tech shirt sold during the game. Then, we are told that they sold 74 Razorback shirts and 156 Texas Tech shirts in total. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling these shirts is: Total revenue = Number of Razorback shirts x $67 + Number of Texas Tech shirts x $165 = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 = $49,880 + $25,350 = $75,230 So, the store earned $75,230 from selling shirts during the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue from t-shirts is $34 x 19 = $658 and from hoodies is $192 x 157 = $29,090. So, the total revenue is $658 + $29,090 = $30,748. Now, let's find out how much does it cost more to buy a hoodie than a t-shirt. We can do this by dividing the total revenue of hoodies ($29,090) by the number of hoodies sold (157): $29,090 / 157 = $185. Therefore, it costs $185 more to buy a hoodie than a t-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each samarreta is $86 and each jersey costs $232. Therefore, if we want to find out how much more a samarreta costs than a jersey, we can subtract their prices: $86 - $232 = -$146. So, it costs $146 less for a samarreta than a jersey.
Response:  The cost price of each Samurai is $51. If they sold 130 Samurais during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, then their total revenue from selling those Samurais would be: Revenue = Number of Samurais x Cost Price of one Samurai = 130 x $51 = $6,430. So, they earned $6,430 with the sale of those Samurais.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each razorback sells for $201 dollars. Then, during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they increased the price of each razorback by $217 dollars, so now each one costs $418 dollars ($201 + $217). Finally, they sold 14 razorbacks, so the total amount of money earned from their sale is: $$ = \text {Number of razorbacks sold} x $\text{Price of each razorback}$ = 14 x $418$ = $5,672$ dollars.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback store made $60 selling shirts. If they earned $10 for each shirt sold, then we can find out how many shirts were sold as follows: Number of shirts = Total amount earned / Amount earned per shirt So, number of shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 shirts Therefore, the Razorback store sold 6 shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback store made $215 from selling 5 shirts. So, we can calculate the cost of each shirt as follows: Cost per shirt = Total amount earned / Number of shirts sold Cost per shirt = $215 / 5 shirts = $43 per shirt Therefore, each shirt costs $43.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the store made $5 for each t-shirt and $215 for each hoodie. So, if they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, their total revenue from these sales would be:

Revenue from t-shirts = 20 x $5 = $100
Revenue from hoodies = 64 x $215 = $13,700

So, in total, the store made $13,800 from these sales."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback made $76 per each t-shirt and $204 for each hoodie. Then, we are told that they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Therefore, their total revenue from t-shirts is:  Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 158 x $76 = $11,938. Similarly, their total revenue from hoodies is:  Revenue from hoodies = Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie = 2 x $204 = $408. So, the total amount of money that Razorback earned from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game is: Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from hoodies = $11,938 + $408 = $12,346.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the cost of each samarreta is $210 and $240 for Razorback and Texas Tech respectively. Therefore, if someone buys one samarreta from either team, they will have to pay $210 or $240 depending on which team's samarreta they buy. Now let's consider how many samarretes were sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. According to the question, 177 samarretes were sold during this game. So, if all these samarretes were bought from Razorback, then the total revenue generated from selling these samarretes would be: Total Revenue = Number of Samarretes Sold x Cost per Samarreta = 177 x $210 = $36,970 If all these samarretes were bought from Texas Tech, then the total revenue generated from selling these samarretes would be: Total Revenue = Number of Samarretes Sold x Cost per Samarreta = 177 x $240 = $45,880 Now, let's find out how much more it costs to buy a samarreta from Texas Tech than from Razorback. We can do this by subtracting the cost of a samarreta from both teams: Cost difference = Texas Tech Samarreta Cost - Razorback Samarreta Cost = $45,880 - $36,970 = $8,910 Therefore, it costs $8,910 more to buy a samarreta from Texas Tech than from Razorback.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total revenue of shirts and hoodies is equal to the sum of their prices. Therefore, we can write: R = S + H Where R is the total revenue, S is the price of shirts, and H is the price of hoodies. Now, let's find out how many shirts were sold during the game: Number of shirts sold = Total revenue - Revenue from hoodies Number of shirts sold = 113 - (25 x number of hoodies) Number of shirts sold = 113 - 675 Number of shirts sold = -562 Number of shirts sold = 0 Since there are no negative numbers of shirts sold, we can conclude that zero shirts were sold during the game. So, the answer to your question is: A samarreta costs more than a samarreta.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50. So, there are 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  We know that there are two sets of chairs with the same number of chairs. So, if one set has x chairs, the other set also has x chairs. Since there are a total of 12 chairs in the patio, we can write the equation: x + x = 12. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 12. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: x = 6. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in the patio and each pair of tables has 3 chairs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pairs of tables as follows: Number of pairs of tables = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per table = 9 / 3 = 3 pairs of tables So, there are 3 pairs of tables in the patio.
Response:  We have 11 pairs of tables and each pair has 13 chairs. So, we have 11 x 2 = 22 chairs in total. Therefore, there are 22 chairs at the party.
Response:  We have 10 sets of chairs and each set has 6 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting in the chairs, how many chairs will be left unoccupied? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people from the total number of chairs. So, if we have 10 sets of chairs with 6 chairs in each set, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60 chairs. If there are 11 people sitting in them, that means we have used up 60 - 11 = 49 chairs. Therefore, there will be 49 chairs left unoccupied.
"Response:  We have 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, we have in total:

12 x 14 = 168 chairs

Plus, there are 6 extra chairs. So, the total number of chairs for the guests is:

168 + 6 = 174 chairs"
Response:  We have 4 sets of tables with 3 chairs each, so we have in total 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since 14 people will attend the party, we need to buy 12 - 14 = -2 more chairs. So, we don't need to buy any additional chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 tables and each table needs 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs needed is: 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. So, they need 126 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Si Lewis wins a total of $460 during 5 weeks of harvesting, he must have won how much money each week? To find out, we can divide the total amount he won ($460) by the number of weeks he worked (5). So, Si Lewis earned $92 per week ($460 / 5 = $92).
Response:  If Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest and he earns $16 per week, then we can find out how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows: $$ \therefore \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$1216}{\$16} = 78 $$ So, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income is:
$$ Income = 21 \times 216 = 4536 $$
Now, we need to calculate the tax amount paid by Lewis. According to the question, he pays $702 in taxes. So, the tax rate is:
$$ Tax Rate = \frac{Tax}{Income} = \frac{702}{4536} = 0.0155 $$
To find out how much money Lewis has at the end of the season, we subtract the tax amount from his total income:
$$ Money Left = Total Income - Tax Amount = 4536 - 702 = 3834 $$
Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 left after paying taxes at the end of the season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $1.357 per week during the 223 weeks of harvest season, then he will have earned total amount of money = Total number of weeks x Weekly income. So, his total earnings for 223 weeks are = $1.357 x 223 = $306,491. Now, if he works for 73 stations of harvest, his total earnings for those 73 stations would be = $306,491 / 73 = $4,200 per station.
Response:  During the harvest season (1091 weeks), Lewis earns $28/week as his regular salary. Additionally, he works overtime hours and earns $939/week. So, during the harvest season, Lewis earns a total of: $$28 \times 1091 = $29,768$$ dollars.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis will receive 403 dollars per month for 233 months during the harvest season. Therefore, his total income during the harvest season is:

$$ Total Income = 403 \times 233 = 93,190 $$
Now, we are asked how much he has to pay in rent each month. According to the question, Lewis pays 49 dollars per month in rent. So, his total expense during the harvest season is:

$$ Total Expense = 49 \times 233 = 11,579 $$
Therefore, Lewis's net income during the harvest season is:

$$ Net Income = Total Income - Total Expense = 93,190 - 11,579 = 81,611 $$
So, Lewis guanyas 81,611 dollars during the harvest season."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has to pay $388 per month for rent during the harvest season. Since there are 1359 days in the harvest season, he will have to pay a total of:
$$ \therefore Total\text{ }rent = 388 \times 1359 = 527,402 $$
So, Lewis pays $527,402 as rent during the harvest season."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has spent 491$ during the 181 weeks of harvest season. So his total spending is 491 x 181 = 87,530$. Now, he needs to pay 216$ per week for rent, which means he will have paid 216 x 181 = 38,366$ in total for rent. Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have 87,530 - 38,366 = 49,164$ left with him.
Response:  We know that Durant has worked for 19 weeks and earned $133 per week. Therefore, he has earned a total of $2507 during these 19 weeks ($133 x 19 = $2507). So, he earns $133 per week.
Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest and he earned a total of $178, then we can calculate how many weeks long the harvest was as follows: Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly income So, if Lewis earned $2 per week for X weeks, his total earnings would be: Total earnings = $2 x X = $178 Now, we know that Lewis earned $178 in total, but we don't know how many weeks it took him to earn that money. To find out, we need to divide the total amount earned by the weekly income: Number of weeks = Total earnings / Weekly income = $178 / $2 = 89 weeks Therefore, Lewis worked for 89 weeks during the harvest season.
Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet tall and he wants to dive into water with a depth of 10 times his height. So, we need to find out how deep the water needs to be in order for Dean to dive safely.  To do this, we can use the formula: Depth = Height x 10  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Depth = 9 ft x 10 = 90 ft Therefore, the water needs to be at least 90 feet deep for Dean to dive safely.
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is twice the height of Dean. So if Dean is 2 meters tall, then the depth of the water is 4 times 2 = 8 meters. Since Ron is 4 meters below the surface, we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 8 - 4 = 4 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water was 4 meters.
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. So if Ron is at a depth of 12 feet (or 4 meters), then the depth of the water is 5 x 4 = 20 feet or 6 meters. Since Dean is 3 meters below Ron, and Ron is at a depth of 6 meters, then Dean must be at a depth of 6 - 3 = 3 meters.
"Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron, so Dean's height is more than 1 meter (since Ron is 1 meter tall). Therefore, Dean's height can be represented as x meters. Since the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, we have:

Depth = 15x

We also know that Ron is at a depth of 4 meters. So, substituting this value into our equation for depth, we get:

15x = 4

Now, dividing both sides of the equation by 15 gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, the depth of the water was 2 times Dean's height."
Response:  We know that after resting they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Since Dean is 3 meters taller than Ron, we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 16 x (Ron's height) + 3 =? meters. Now we are given that Ron is at a depth of 4 meters, so we can substitute this value in the equation and solve for the depth of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water was 16 x (4) + 3 = 64 + 3 = 67 meters deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is $6$ feet (or $7.2$ meters) below Ron's height. So, if Ron has height $h = 5$ meters ($= 16.4$ feet), then Dean has height $d = h - 6 = 4.8$ meters ($= 15.7$ feet). Now, we are told that the depth of water is $9$ times Dean's height, so the depth of water is: $$depth = 9 \times d = 9 \times 15.7 = 139.3$$ meters ($= 450.5$ feet). Therefore, the depth of water is $139.3$ meters ($= 450.5$ feet).
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to distribute them equally between two shelves, then he will have 34/2 = 17 books in each shelf.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he must have __________ shelves.
Response:  We know that Brian has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 shelves. So, he has a total number of books = 27 x 23 = 611 books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines = 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total number of books and magazines = 611 + 1840 = 2451 items in all.
Response:  We know that Brian has 9 books in each of his 10 bookshelves, so he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. Similarly, we know that he has 46 magazines in each of his 10 magazine racks, so he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total of 90 + 460 = 550 publications.
Response:  We know that Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 shelves. So, he has a total number of books = 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, he has a total number of magazines = 61 x 29 = 1799 magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total of 647 + 1799 = 2446 items in all his shelves.
Response:  We know that Brian has seven sties of books with the same number of books in each style. So, if he has $28$ books in total, then there are $\frac{28}{7} = 4$ books in each style.
Response:  We know that Brian has 38 books in total and each shelf contains 2 books. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf Therefore, we have: Number of shelves = 38 / 2 = 19 shelves.  So, Brian has 19 shelves.
"Response:  If Carol wants to send out 10 invitations in total and each pack of invitations has 2 invitations inside, then she will need:

$$ \text {Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total number of invitations}}{\text{Number of invitations in each pack}} $$

So, we can set up the equation:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of packs} = \frac{10}{2}} = 5 $$

Therefore, Carol needs to buy 5 packs of invitations to make sure that no friend is left out."
Response:  If Carol is sending out invitations to 12 friends and she bought 3 packages of invitations, then each package must contain at least 4 invitations (since there are 12 friends in total). So, the number of invitations in each package is:  Number of invitations per package = Total number of friends / Number of packages = 12 friends / 3 packages = 4 invitations per package
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packs of invitations and each pack has 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  If she sends invitations to only two friends, then the number of remaining invitations is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  Firstly, Carol bought 6 packs of invitations each containing 14 invitations, so she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she purchased additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number to 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Therefore, Carol can invite up to 95 friends to her party.
Response:  If Carol bought 2 packs of invitations and each pack has 3 invitations, then she already has 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). To convince 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). So, Carol needs to buy 3 more invitations.
Response:  If she scored 12 points in each of her games, then she scored a total of 36 points from all her games combined. So, if she played x number of games, then we can write an equation as follows:  Total score = Number of games \* Score per game  Therefore, we have:  Total score = 36 \* x  Now, we need to solve for x (the number of games). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 36:  x = Total score / 36  Substituting the value given in the question - 36 - into this equation, we get:  x = 36 / 36  Which simplifies to:  x = 1  Therefore, Melissa played only one game!
Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in total and she played 3 games, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27). So, she scored 27 points in each of her three games.
Response:  We know that La Melissa scored 109 points in each match and obtained 82 bonus points in each match as well. So, if she played 79 matches, her total score would be: Total score = Number of points scored x Bonus points obtained = 109 x 82 = 8634 points Therefore, La Melissa scored 8634 points in 79 matches.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game, then we can write an equation as follows: Total points = Number of games x Points per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total points = 21 points / number of games Therefore, to find out how many games Melissa played, we need to divide the total points by the points per game: Number of games = Total points / Points per game = 21 points / 7 points/game = 3 games Thus, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in 13 games and she scored the same number of points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: P = 91 / 13 (where P is the number of points Melissa scored in each game). Now, we need to solve for P. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 13: P = 91 / 13 = x. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in each game (since 91 divided by 13 equals 7).
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the wheel of fortune at Paradise Park and 20 people can drive at the same time, then each seat has to accommodate half of the number of people who can drive simultaneously. Therefore, we need to divide 20 by 4, which gives us 5 as the number of people that can sit on each seat.
Response:  We know that the Ferris wheel has seats for 9 people each. If 18 people can ride at the same time, then we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many rides the Ferris wheel can make in one turn. So, the answer is: $ \boxed{2}$
Response:  We know that each wheel of fortune in the park has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, we need to find out how many people can fit in all the wheels at once. To do this, we will divide the total number of seats (19 x 10 = 190) by the number of people who can sit in one wheel (15). Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheels simultaneously is 190/15 = 13.
Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in the wheel of fortune at Paradise Park and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then we have 18 - 10 = 8 available seats left. So, the maximum number of people who can climb to the wheel of fortune at the same time is 8.
Response:  We know that the wheel of fortune in Paradise Park has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. If there are currently 16 people sitting on the wheel, how many more people can join them? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people already on the wheel from the total capacity of the wheel. So, the answer is:  Number of additional people who can join = Total capacity - Current occupancy = 6 x 14 = 84 - 16 = 68 people. Therefore, 68 more people can join the wheel of fortune in Paradise Park.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the Ferris wheel in Paradise Park. If each small seat can hold 14 people, then we have: Number of small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 people who can ride the Ferris wheel in small seats. Now, let's count how many people can ride the Ferris wheel in large seats: Number of large seats = 23 x 54 = 1208 people who can ride the Ferris wheel in large seats. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is: Total number of riders = 28 + 1208 = 1236 people.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in the wheel of fortune at Paradise Park. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, and each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, if we want to know how many people can play the wheel of fortune using only large seats, we need to multiply the number of large seats by the number of people each one can accommodate:  Number of people who can play the wheel of fortune = Number of large seats x Capacity per large seat  Number of large seats = 7  Capacity per large seat = 12 people  Therefore, the total number of people who can play the wheel of fortune using only large seats is:  Number of people who can play the wheel of fortune = 7 x 12 = 84 people
Response:  If 16 people can play the wheel of fortune in Paradise Park at the same time and there are 4 seats in the wheel, then each seat can accommodate 4 people. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If four people can play the wheel of fortune in Paradise Park at the same time and each seat of the wheel can hold two people, then we need to know how many seats the wheel has. So, the number of places on the wheel is equal to the number of people who can play it simultaneously multiplied by the number of people that one seat can hold. Therefore, if we multiply 4 (the number of people who can play) by 2 (the number of people per seat), we get 8 places on the wheel.
Response:  If there are 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of pieces, then the total number of pieces is equal to 7 x Number of pieces per pizza = 7 x x (where x is the number of pieces in one pizza). Since there are 14 pieces in total, we can set up the equation: 7x = 14. Solving for x, we get: x = 2 (since 7x = 14, dividing both sides by 7 gives us x = 2). So, each pizza has 2 pieces.
Response:  If we have to ask for pizzas and each pizza has 2 pieces, then the number of pizzes we need to ask for is equal to the total number of pieces divided by 2. In this case, there are 28 pieces in total, so we need to ask for 14 pizzes (28 / 2 = 14).
Response:  If they have demanded 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 pieces, then we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of pizzies x Number of pieces per pizza = 17 x 4 = 68 pieces. Therefore, there are 68 pieces of pizza in total.
Response:  If there are 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two people sharing the pizzas, they will get 45 slices each (since 2 x 45 = 90). So, yes, they will be able to divide them equally among themselves if they distribute them in an equitable manner.
Response:  We know that La Paige helped her mother to plant flowers and together they planted some seeds. If there are 45 channels of flowers, then we need to divide the number of seeds they planted among these channels. Since they planted 10 seeds in each flower bed, we have: Number of seeds = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds = 10 (seeds per channel) x 45 (channels of flowers) = 450 seeds So, La Paige and her mother planted 450 seeds.
Response:  We know that La Paige and her mother together planted 45 seeds in 9 channels. If they had equally divided the number of seeds among all the channels, then the number of seeds each channel would have received is: Number of seeds = Total number of seeds / Number of channels So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of seeds = 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per channel Now, since La Paige was helping her mother, she must have helped with fewer channels than her mother did. Therefore, the number of seeds La Paige planted in each channel is half of the total number of seeds her mother planted. So, La Paige planted 5/2 = 2.5 seeds per channel.
Response:  We know that La Paige and her mother together planted 36 seeds in total. Since they only managed to grow 58 flowers from those seeds, it means that not all of the seeds germinated or grew into plants. So, we can deduce that there were some empty spaces or unused land where no flowers grew at all. Therefore, the number of flower beds is less than the total number of seeds planted.  In other words, if they planted 12 seeds per bed, then the number of flower beds would be: Number of flower beds = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per bed = 36 / 12 = 3 flower beds.  So, there are three flower beds with 58 flowers each.
Response:  We know that La Paige and her mother together planted 55 seeds in total. Then we are told that they put 15 seeds in each flower pot. So, the number of seedlings that grew into flowers is equal to the number of flower pots multiplied by the number of seeds sown in each pot. Therefore, the answer is: Number of floral stem = Total number of seeds x Number of seeds per pot = 55 x 15 = 825 floral stems.
Response:  If La Paige and her mother are planting flowers in each flower bed, then there will be 10 llavors per flower bed. So if they plant 60 llavors, that means they have 60/10 = 6 flower beds. Therefore, they have 6 llits of flowers.
Response:  We know that La Paige and her mother planted 32 seeds in total. If they divided these seeds equally among 8 channels, then each channel would have received 4 seeds (32/8 = 4). So, if they put the same number of seeds in each flower bed, then the number of seeds in each flower bed is 4.
"Response:  If Matthew had 12 gallettes (he ate one himself), and he gave 2 to each of his 11 friends, then...

Matthew gave out a total of 2 x 11 = 22 gallettes. So, Matthew had 12 - 22 = -9 gallettes left.

Therefore, Matthew had -9 gallettes."
Response:  If Matthew had 8 gallettes and gave 2 to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 8 x 2 = 16 gallettes to his friends. So, Matthew gave galettes to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave the same number of galetes to each of his 5 friends, then he gave 15 / 5 = 3 galetes to each friend. So, each friend menjat 3 galetes.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 galetes and gave the same number to his 3 friends, then he gave 8 galetes to each friend (since 3 x 8 = 24). So, Matthew gave 8 galetes to his friends. Now, if he still has 17 galetes left after giving them away, that means he had 17 - 8 = 9 galetes left originally. Therefore, Matthew gave 9 galetes to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 galetes and 34 pastries, in total he had 56 sweets (22 + 34).  Since there were 11 friends, each friend got an equal number of sweets. So, if we divide 56 by 11, we get that each person got 5 sweets (56 / 11 = 5).
Response:  If Matthew had 29 galetes and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 14.5 galetes (29 / 2) to each friend. Similarly, if he had 30 pastissos and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 15 pastissos (30 / 2) to each friend.
Response:  If Matthew had 14 galetes and 21 pastries, that means he has a total of 35 sweets (14 + 21).  Since he gave the same number of sweets to each of his 7 friends, we can say that each friend got 5 sweets (35 / 7 = 5). So, each person menjaed 5 galetes and 5 pastissos.
Response:  If Matthew has 36 galetes and he wants to give an equal number of galetes to his 18 friends, then we can say that each friend will get x galetes, where x is the total number of galetes divided by the number of friends. So, in this case, each friend will get: 36 / 18 = 2 galetes. Therefore, each person will eat 2 galetes.
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 biscuits to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 6 x 5 = 30 biscuits. Since there were 36 galetses in total, and Matthew gave out 30 biscuits, that means he had 36 - 30 = 6 galetses left over for himself. So, Matthew gave biscuits to 5 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 gallettes and gave an equal number of crepes to each of his two friends, then he gave 23/2 = 11 crepes to each friend. So, each friend got 11 crepes from Matthew. As for the gallettes, since Matthew had 23 initially and gave 11 to each friend, he has 23 - (2 x 11) = 9 gallettes left after giving them away.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 gallettes and he gave some to his friends. So, after giving some away, he was left with 23 crepes. To find out how many gallettes Matthew gave to his friends, we can divide the number of crepes he has left (23) by the number of friends he had (5). Therefore, Matthew gave 4.6 gallettes per friend (23 / 5 = 4.6).
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of galets and pastries to his four friends, then he must have given each friend $4$ times as many galets as pastries. Therefore, if he had initially $32$ galets and $98$ pastries, then each friend received $\frac{32}{4} = 8$ galets and $\frac{98}{4} = 24$ pastries.
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of galets and pastries to his four friends, then he must have given each friend x pastries. Since there were 8 pastries initially, this means that each friend got 8/4 = 2 pastries.
"Response:  If Matthew had initially 13 galetes and 15 pastissos, then he gave each of his 28 friends an equal number of both galetes and pastissos. So, if x is the number of galetes and y is the number of pastissos that each friend received, we can write the equation:
x + y = 13 (galetes)
y + x = 15 (pastissos)
Now, since there are 28 friends in total, we can multiply both equations by 28 to get:
2(x + y) = 28 (galetes)
2(y + x) = 28 (pastissos)
Simplifying these equations, we get:
x = 46 (galetes)
y = 70 (pastissos)
Therefore, each person received 46 galetes and 70 pastissos from Matthew."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought some water bottles when they were on sale and she drank 109 bottles per day. If the bottles lasted for 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she had in total as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of days x Number of bottles per day
= 74 days x 109 bottles/day
= 8,263 bottles

Therefore, Debbie had purchased 8,263 water bottles."
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 amphorae of water and she consumed the same number of amphorae every day. If it took 17 days to finish all the amphorae, then we can calculate how many amphorae Debbie consumed each day as follows: Number of amphorae consumed per day = Total number of amphorae / Time taken to consume them = 153 amphorae / 17 days = 9 amphorae per day
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 264 bottles of water and she drank 15 per day for 11 days. So we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bottles drunk = Total number of bottles x Days used  In this case, the total number of bottles is 264, and the number of days used is 11. Therefore, the equation becomes:  Number of bottles drunk = 264 x 11  Now we need to solve for the number of bottles left. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by the number of days used:  Number of bottles drunk = 2640 (Answer: 264 - 11 = 253)  So Debbie has 253 bottles left after drinking 15 per day for 11 days.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 301 bottles of water at a discount and consumed 144 bottles per day for some days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Let x = number of days Debbie consumed water

Now, let's solve for x:

Debbie had 157 bottles left after consuming for x days

So, we can set up the following equation:

157 = x + 301

Solving for x, we get:

x = 128

Therefore, Debbie consumed water for 128 days."
Response:  If Debbie drinks 4 ampolles of water and has 88 ampoles of water left, she will have 88 - 4 = 84 ampolles of water left after one day. Since she also has 13 ampolles of soda left, she will have 84 + 13 = 97 ampolles of liquid left after one day. So, the ampolles of water will last for 97 / 4 = 24 days. Therefore, the ampolles of water will last for 24 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda, then she has a total of 456 bottles.  If she drinks 312 bottles of water per day, that means she has 144 bottles left after one day (312 - 200 = 144).  Since there are 256 bottles of soda, if she drinks 4 bottles per day, it will last her for 64 days (4/day x 256 bottles = 64 days). Therefore, the soda will last Debbie for 64 days.
"Response:  If Debbie buys 12 water bottles per day and she has been doing so for x days, then we can write an equation as follows:

Debbie bought 12 water bottles/day = x days

Now, let's solve for 'x'. We know that Debbie has been buying 12 water bottles per day for 30 days (as given in the problem). Therefore, we can substitute 'x' with 30 in the above equation to get:

12 water bottles/day = 30 days

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 30

Therefore, Debbie has been buying 12 water bottles per day for 30 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water. If she drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days her supply will last as follows:

Days = Total amount of drinks / Daily consumption
= 95 + 180 - (15 x Days) - (54 x Days)
= 95 + 180 - (15 x Days) - (54 x Days)
= 95 + 180 - 270
= -35

So, if Debbie drinks 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, her supply of both drinks will last for approximately 35 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. If she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days it would take for her to finish all the drinks as follows:

Days = Total amount of drinks / Daily consumption
= 360 + 162
/ 122 + 9
= 58 + 14
= 72 days
Therefore, it would take Debbie approximately 72 days to finish all the drinks if she continues consuming them at the same rate."
"Response:  If La Faye has 14 rows with 11 llapis in each row, then she has a total of:

14 rows x 11 llapis per row = 154 llapis
Therefore, La Faye has 154 llapis in total."
Response:  If La Faye has placed 12 llapis in total and wants to divide them equally among three rows, then each row will have how many llapis?  To find out, we can use division. So, number of llapis in each row = Total number of llapis / Number of rows.  In this case, total number of llapis is 12 and number of rows is 3. Therefore, number of llapis in each row = 12 / 3 = 4.  So, La Faye placed 4 llapis in each row.
Response:  If we have 28 packages of lashes and each package has 24 lashes, then in total we have 28 x 24 = 672 lashes.  Now, if LaFay wants to place her lashes in rows with 16 lashes in each row, she can do so because she has more than enough lashes to fill all the rows. So, she can make 672 / 16 = 43 rows. Therefore, LaFay can make 43 rows of lashes.
Response:  We know that La Faye has 6 packs of lipstick with 14 lipsticks in each pack. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 lipsticks. Since we are asked how many lipsticks La Faye has in total, the answer is 84.
Response:  If La Faye has 35 llapis and wants to place them in rows with 5 llapis in each row, she can do so in 7 rows. Therefore, she could make 7 rows of 5 llapis each.
Response:  We know that La Faye has placed her llapis and crayons in 19 rows with 4 llapis and 27 crayons in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of llapis as follows: Number of llapis = Total number of rows x Number of llapis per row = 19 x 4 = 76 Llapis So, La Faye has 76 llapis in total.
Response:  We know that La Faye has 7 rows of llapis and 36 llapis in each row. Therefore, the total number of llapis is: 7 x 36 = 252 llapis.
Response:  We know that La Faye has 11 rows of llapis and crayons. Each row has 31 llapis and 27 crayons. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Llapis = 31 x Rows Crayons = 27 x Rows In this case, the number of llapis is equal to 31 times the number of rows, and the number of crayons is equal to 27 times the number of rows. So, if there are 11 rows, then the number of llapis is: 31 x 11 = 341 llapis And the number of crayons is: 27 x 11 = 297 crayons Therefore, La Faye has 341 llapis and 297 crayons in total.
Response:  If La Faye has 30 llapis and wants to place them in files with 5 llapis each file, then she can make...  Files = Number of llapis / Number of llapis per file = 30 / 5 = 6 files. Therefore, La Faye could make 6 files with her 30 llapis.
Response:  If La Faye had 6 llapis and wanted to place them in two rows of equal size, she would need to divide them equally between the two rows.  Therefore, if she placed 3 llapis in each row, then she placed 6 / 2 = 3 llapis in each row.
Response:  If La Faye has 35 packets of pencils and each packet contains 4 pencils, then she has a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pencils.  To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide the number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row. So, if she wants to make rows with 2 pencils in each row, she will be able to make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, La Faye could make 70 rows of pencils.
Response:  We know that La Faye had 31 packets of pencils and each packet contained 6 pencils. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are asked how many pencils she has placed in rows with 19 pencils in each row. Therefore, the number of rows she has placed is 186 / 19 = 9 rows. So, La Faye has placed 9 rows of pencils.
Response:  We know that La Faye has 30 rows of llapis and crayons. In each row, there are 71 crayons and 24 llapis. Therefore, the total number of llapis is:  Number of llapis = Total number of rows x Number of llapis in each row  Number of rows = 30  Number of llapis in each row = 24 So, the total number of llapis is:  Total number of llapis = 30 x 24 = 720
"Response:  If La Faye has 6 llapis in each of the 16 rows, then she has a total of:

6 x 16 = 96 llapis
So, La Faye has 96 llapis in total."
Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students in total. Also, we know that there are 7 school buses. So, each bus can carry how many students? To find out, let's divide the number of students by the number of buses:  Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of school buses = 98 / 7 = 14 Students per bus Now, since each bus has seats, let's assume that each bus has 50 seats (this is just an estimate). Therefore, the total number of seats available for the excursió is: Total number of seats = Number of buses x Number of seats per bus = 7 x 50 = 350 seats So, if all the buses are full, then the maximum number of students who can go on the excursion is: Maximum number of students = Total number of seats / Number of students per bus = 350 / 14 = 25 students
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each class has 30 students (as assumed). So, the total number of students in the school is:

84 classes x 30 students/class = 2520 students

Now, we need to calculate how many students will be going on the field trip. The question states that ""95 buses"" are full with ""118 seats per bus."" Therefore, the total number of students who can go on the field trip is:

95 buses x 118 seats/bus = 11,170 students

So, there are 11,170 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in total at the school and each class has 66 students. Therefore, we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4252 students attending the school. Since there are six seats available on each bus, we need to divide the number of students by six to find out how many buses we need: 4252 / 6 = 708 buses needed for the excursion.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in total at the school and each class has an equal number of students (58). So, we have a total of 58 x 87 = 4960 students attending the school. Since there are 2 seats available on each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses we need: 4960 / 2 = 248 buses needed for the excursion.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in total at the school and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, we can assume that there are 24 x 120 = 2880 students in total at the school. Since there are 84 seats available on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 84 to find out how many students go on each bus. So, 2880 / 84 = 35 students per bus. Thus, there are 35 students per class.
Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total at the school and they will be divided into groups of 8 students each for the excursion. So, we need to divide 102 by 8 to find out how many groups we can make.  Therefore, the number of buses needed is: 102 / 8 = 13 groups or 13 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classes in the school and 11 students in total. If 8 students do not want to go on the trip, then we subtract 8 from 11, which gives us 3 remaining students who will go on the trip. Therefore, 3 students will go on the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes at school and each class has 3 students. So, we have 72 x 3 = 216 students in total. Since each bus can seat 3 students, we need 216 / 3 = 72 buses to transport all the students for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 72 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 46 school buses and 92 students in the school. Since each bus can seat at most 50 students (as assumed), we have: Number of seats on all buses = 46 x 50 = 2300 seats Now, since every student will be transported by a bus, we have: Total number of students who will go on the field trip = 92 students So, the number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of buses = 92 / 46 = 2 students per bus Therefore, there are 2 students per bus.
"Response:  If there are 11 students in class and each student gets 9 hairballs from Haley, then the total number of hairballs given by Haley is:

$$ \text {Total number of hairballs} = 11 \times 9 = 99 $$
So, Haley had $99$ hairballs initially."
Response:  If Haley has 10 hairs and gives 5 to each of 5 boys, then she gave a total of 5 x 5 = 25 hairs to the boys. So, Haley gave 25 hairs to the boys.
Response:  If there are 6 boys and they like to play with hair, then each boy will get 1/6 of Haley's hair, which is 15/6 = 2 pétols. So, each boy will receive 2 pétols from Haley.
Response:  If 13 children like to play with hair and 50 children like to play cards, then we can say that each child likes to play with hair for 4 times (since there are 13/50 = 0.26 times as many children who like to play with hair). So, if Haley has 26 hairs, she will give 26 / 0.26 = 100 hairs to each of the 13 children who like to play with them.
Response:  If there are 20 pebbles and 5 boys in the class, each boy will get 4 pebbles (since 5 x 4 = 20). So, each boy will receive 4 pebbles.
Response:  If there are x boys in the class and each boy received 2 bullets from Haley, then the total number of bullets given out is 2x. Since there are 28 bills in total, we can set up the equation: 2x = 28. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, Haley gave 2 bullets to 14 boys in the class.
Response:  We know that Frank was reading his favorite book and he read 14 pages per day. So, to find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can use the following formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily pages read. In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 392, and Frank reads 14 pages per day, so: Number of days = 392 / 14 = 27 days Therefore, Frank finished reading his book in 27 days.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. So, we can write an equation: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of pages = 569 x 22  Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to finish reading his book, which means he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pages (612) by the number of days it took him to finish the book (6). So, Frank read for approximately 102 pages per day ($612$ / $6$ = $102$). Now, let's convert this value from pages to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we can divide the number of pages read per day by 24 to get the number of hours spent reading per day: $102$ pages / $24$ hours = $4.33$ hours per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately $4.33$ hours per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his book. Since there are 5 chapters in total, each chapter must have taken him approximately 44 days (220/5 = 44) to read. Now, let's calculate how many pages each chapter has: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read Each chapter has approximately 555 pages / 44 days = 12.6 pages per day So, each chapter has around 12.6 pages. Therefore, each chapter has approximately 555/5 = 111 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his book. Therefore, he read at most $660 \text{ days} = 27 \text{ pages/day}$ (since there are $193 \text{ pages} = 27 \times 7$ pages in each chapter).  Now, since Frank read $\boxed{\text{15 chapters}}$ in total, he must have read at least $\boxed{\text{15 \times 27 = 415 pages}} $ in total. So, the number of pages Frank read per day is $\boxed{\text{415 pages / 660 days = 0.64 pages/day}}$.
Response:  If Frank took 3 days to finish each book, then he finished reading 249 pages per day. So, he read at a rate of pages/day = 249 pages/day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 492 days to finish all the books. If each book had 66 pages and it took him 12 days to finish one book, then he finished $66$ books in total. Therefore, the number of books Frank read is $\boxed{66}$.
Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish his book, that means he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the number of days by the number of hours in a day (24). So, if Frank read for x hours per day, then he finished the book in 16 / x days. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you take it from here and find the value of x?
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, it will take him:

Time = Number of pages / Number of pages read per day
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank will need 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to finish reading his book. So, he read for how many hours per day?  To find out, we can divide the number of pages in the book (450 x 41 = 17,950) by the number of days it took him to finish reading it (30). Therefore, Frank read approximately 563 pages per day ($17,950 / $30).
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish his book. Since each chapter has 594 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows: Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish the book Time taken to finish the book = 607 days x 24 hours/day = 14,680 hours Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of hours he spent reading per day: Total number of pages / Reading time per day = 594 pages / 14,680 hours = approximately 41 pages per day Therefore, each chapter in the book has approximately 41 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish his book. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 2 x 405 pages + 405 pages
= 1210 pages

Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to read them:

Capítols llegeixos al dia = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 1210 pages / 664 days
= 1.8 capítols/dia
Therefore, Frank legible approximately 1.8 chapters per day."
"Response:  If we have 6 packages of DVDs and they cost $120 in total, then each package costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per package
Therefore, each paquet of DVDs costs $20."
Response:  If each package costs $81 dollars, then the total cost of 33 packages will be: 33 x $81 = $2693.
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 for each package, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows: Number of packages = Total amount available / Cost of each package = $93 / $106 = 8/5 = 1.6 packages So, you can buy 1.6 packages of DVDs with $93.
Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 for each package, then we need to calculate how much one package would cost after applying the discount. So, the price of one package = $76 - ($76 x 25%) = $76 - $19 = $57. Therefore, you will have to pay $57 for each package.
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each DVD costs $26, then...

$$ \text {Number of DVDs} = \frac{\$104}{\$26} $$

So, you can buy:

$$ \boxed{4} $$

paquets of DVDs."
Response:  If we have $28 to buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package costs $14.
Response:  We know that there are 18 platanes in Philip's collection. If we organize them into groups of size 2, then we can have at most 9 different groups. So, the number of groups is between 0 and 9, inclusive. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of plátanos in Philip's collection and each group has 187 plátanos. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of plátanos = 140 x 187 = 23,690 plátanos. Therefore, Philip has 23,690 plátanos in his collection.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in total. If we divide them equally among 7 groups of bananas, each group will have 29 bananas (203 / 7 = 29). Now, let's distribute the remaining 174 bananas among 95 groups of oranges. Each group of oranges will have 18 oranges (174 / 95 = 18). Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is 29, and the number of oranges in each group is 18.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 142 bananas and 356 tangerines in Philip's collection.  If we organize the bananas into 47 groups of equal size, each group will have 3 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is 47 x 3 = 140. Similarly, if we organize the tangerines into 178 groups of equal size, each group will have 2 tangerines. Therefore, the total number of tangerines is 178 x 2 = 356. So, the weight of each group of tangerines is 356 / 178 = 2.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of plátanos in Philip's collection and we want to find out how many plátanos are in each group. So, let's divide the total number of plátanos (392) by the number of groups (196): 392 / 196 = 2 Therefore, each group has 2 plátanos.
Response:  We know that there are 180 plátanos in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18. So, we can divide them equally among 18 groups. Therefore, the number of groups is:  Number of groups = Total number of plátanos / Size of each group  Number of groups = 180 / 18  Number of groups = 10
Response:  We know that there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the oranges into 2 groups, each group will have 43 oranges (87 / 2 = 43). Now, let's distribute the remaining 43 oranges among the 93 groups of bananas. Each group of bananas can have up to 46 oranges (93 / 4 = 23), but since we don't want any group to have fewer than 10 oranges, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 25 groups with 17 oranges each (23 x 2 = 46). Therefore, there are 43 oranges in one group and 17 oranges in each of the other 24 groups. So, the total number of plátanos in each group is 43 + 17 x 24 = 1152 plátanos.
Response:  We know that there are 384 tangerines and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the tangerines into groups of 16, then each group will have 24 tangerines (384 / 16 = 24). Similarly, if we divide the bananas into groups of 345, then each group will have 7 bananas (192 / 345 = 7). So, there will be 24 tangerines and 7 bananas in each group.
Response:  If Brenda makes 38 galetes and each galette has 19 pieces, then she will have made a total of 38 x 19 = 702 pieces of galettes.
Response:  If Brenda made 14 people 30 galetes each, then she prepared a total of 420 galetes (14 x 30 = 420).
Response:  If Brenda made 22 galetes and had to throw away 17 of them, that means she has 5 galetes left. Now, let's assume each person got an equal number of galetes. So, if there were 5 people in total, each person would have received 5/5 = 1 galette. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  If Brenda made 18 galetes and each guest had as many galetes as they did at the previous party (where 9 guests didn't come), then...

Answer: Each guest would have 2 galetes (since there were originally 9 guests who didn't come). So, in total, Brenda would have prepared 18 x 2 = 36 galetes."
Response:  If Brenda made 14 galetes for two guests, that means each guest will have 7 galetes (since there are 2 guests and 14 galetes in total). So, if we want to find out how many galetes each guest has, we can divide the number of galetes by 2: 7 galetes / 2 = 3.5 galetes per guest. Since you cannot have half a galette, we round up to 4 galetes per guest. Therefore, the answer is 4 galetes per guest.
Response:  If there were 5 guests and each guest had 2 galetes, then the number of galetes prepared would be 5 x 2 = 10 galetes. So, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of caramel and he puts them equally in two boxes, then each box will have 42/2 = 21 pieces of caramel. Therefore, there are 21 trossos (or pieces) of caramel in each box.
"Response:  If Frank had x bolets of caramels and he divided them equally among y bosses, then we can write an equation as follows:
x / y = 33 (since each bossa contains 33 pieces)
Now, we need to find out what is the value of x. We know that x represents the number of bolets of caramels that Frank had initially. So, we can substitute this value in the equation above:
x / y = 33
Solving for x, we get:
x = y \* 33
In this case, y = 26 (the number of bosses). Therefore, the value of x is:
x = 26 \* 33 = 840
So, Frank had 840 bolets of caramels initially."
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 caramels and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 caramels left. If we divide these 9 caramels equally among 9 bags (since each bag can hold 9 caramels), then Frank will have 1 caramel in 9 bags. Therefore, Frank will have 9 bags.
Response:  If Frank has 22 caramels and he wants to divide them equally among 11 bags, then each bag will contain 22/11 = 2 caramels. So, Frank will have 11 bags of caramels.
Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of caramel and he puts them in two bowls, then each bowl will have how many pieces of caramel? We can divide 16 by 2 to find out. So, there are 8 pieces of caramel in each bowl.
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 boxes of three-folders, that means she sold 25 x 14 = 350 folders in total. So, if each box contains 14 folders, then the number of boxes is 350 / 14 = 25 boxes. Therefore, Shirley has to deliver 25 boxes of three-folders.
Response:  If Shirley sold 10 boxes of three-folders and she has to deliver 5 boxes, then there are 10 / 5 = 2 boxes left over that she did not deliver. So, there are 2 boxes of three-folders in each box.
Response:  We know that the total number of ampolles of refresc is 67 + 9 = 76 ampolles. So, we can say that there are 76 - 9 = 67 more ampolles of refresc than of refresc dietétic. Therefore, the number of ampolles of refresc normal is 67.
Response:  We know that the total number of ampolles of both types is equal to 83 (22 + 61). Now we have to find out how many more ampolles of refresc dietètic than of refresc normal there are. So, let's divide the number of ampolles of refresc dietètic (61) by the number of ampolles of refresc normal (22):  Number of more ampolles of refresc dietètic = 61 / 22 = 2.73 Therefore, there are 2 more ampolles of refresc dietètic than of refresc normal.
Response:  We know that there are 30 ampolles of regular refreshment and 8 ampolles of dietetic refreshment. Therefore, in total, we have: 30 + 8 = 38 ampolles. As for the apples, we are told that there are 41 apples. So, in addition to the ampolles of refreshment, we also have 41 apples. In total, then, we have 38 ampolles + 41 apples = 79 objects.
Response:  We know that there are 79 ampolles of regular soda and 53 ampolles of diet soda. To find out how many more ampolles of regular soda than diet soda there are, we can subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of ampolles of soda: 79 - 53 = 26. So, there are 26 more ampolles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 ampolles of dietetic drink and 83 ampolles of regular drink. So, we can write this as:

Dietetic drink = 54 ampolles
Regular drink = 83 ampolles
Now, let's find out how many more regular drinks than dietetic drinks there are:
More regular drinks = 83 - 54 = 29
So, there are 29 more regular drinks than dietetic drinks."
Response:  We know that there are 17 ampolles in total and 9 of them are regular refreshments. So, the number of dietetic refreshment ampolles is 17 - 9 = 8. Since they had 29 poms, each pom can hold 3-4 ampolles of refreshment (since poms usually hold around 300 ml). Therefore, the number of dietetic refreshment ampolles consumed is 8 x 3 = 24.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of dietetic drink and 60 bottles of regular drink. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of regular drink = Total number of drinks - Number of dietetic drinks

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

Number of regular drink = 60 - 19
= 41

Therefore, there were 41 more bottles of regular refreshment than dietetic refreshment."
"Response:  We know that there are 78 pomes and we want to find out how many more than pome...
Question: Un supermercat tenir 72 ampolles de refresc normal, 32 ampolles de refresc dietètic i 78 pomes. Quantes ampolles més que de poma tenien?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that there are 78 pomes and we want to find out how many more than pommes they have in total. So, let's calculate it: Total number of ampolles = Normal + Dietetic + Pommes = 72 + 32 + 78 = 182 ampolles Therefore, they had 182 - 78 = 104 more ampolles of other drinks than pommes."
Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. So, we can say that each apple is equivalent to x bottles of soda, where x = 80 / 36 = 2.25. Therefore, the number of bottles of soda more than apples is: Number of bottles of soda more than apples = Total number of bottles of soda - Number of apples = 80 - 36 = 44.
Response:  We know that there are 30 ampolles in total and 28 of them are regular refreshments. So, we have to find out how many ampolles are dietetic refreshments. Since they are not all equal (the rest), let's assume that each dietetic ampolle contains half as much liquid as a regular one. Therefore, if an ampolla of regular refreshment has x milliliters of liquid, then an ampolla of dietetic refreshment will have x/2 milliliters of liquid. Now, since there are n dietetic ampolles, we can write the equation:  Total number of milliliters of liquid = Number of regular ampolles x volume of each ampolla + Number of dietetic ampolles x volume of each dietetic ampolla  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Total number of milliliters of liquid = 28 x 250 + n x 125  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Total number of milliliters of liquid = 700 + n x 125  Solving for n, we get:  n = 6  Therefore, there were 6 dietetic ampolles of refreshment.
Response:  We know that there are 4 dietetic drinks and 79 regular drinks in total. So, if we divide the number of regular drinks by 4 (the number of dietetic drinks), we get 19.75 ( rounded to the nearest whole number = 20). Therefore, there were 20 bottles of regular refreshments.
Response:  Total number of regular refrescos = 57 - 26 = 31.  Total number of dietetic refrescos = 26.  Total number of lit refrescos = 27. So, in total they had 31 + 26 + 27 = 84 ampolles of refreshments.
Response:  We know that there are 81 ampolles of regular refreshment and 60 ampolles of dietetic refreshment. To find out how many more ampolles of regular refreshment there were, we can subtract the number of dietetic ampolles from the total number of ampolles: 81 - 60 = 21. So, there were 21 more ampolles of regular refreshment than dietetic refreshment.
Response:  We know that there are 49 ampolles of regular refreshment and 40 ampolles of dietetic refreshment. So in total, we have: 49 + 40 = 89 ampolles of refreshments. Since there are 6 liters of lite refreshment, we can calculate the number of ampolles of lite refreshment as follows: 6 / 25 = 0.24 ampolles (since each liter is equal to 25 ampolles). Therefore, the total number of ampolles of all types of refreshment is: 89 + 0.24 = 89.24 ampolles.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors yesterday and then 317 visitors today, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers to find out how many more visitors came today:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

So, 22 more visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham today compared to yesterday."
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before, and 246 visitors that day, then the total number of visitors in 25 days would be: Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today x Number of days Total visitors = 703 + (246 x 25) Total visitors = 703 + 6100 Total visitors = 6830 Visitors went to the Palace of Buckingham for 25 days.
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before and 666 visitors that day, then the difference between the two days is:

$$ \text{Difference} = 100 - 666 = -566 $$
So, $566$ more visitors visited the palace on the day in question than on the previous day."
Response:  We know that in the last 327 days, 406 people visited the Buckingham Palace. So, if we want to find out how many visitors came to the palace the day before, we can use the following equation: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit x (Number of days since the last visit - 1)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of visitors = 406 / 327 x (327 - 1) = 135 Therefore, there were 135 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before.
Response:  We know that in the last 85 days, 829 people visited the Buckingham Palace. So, if 45 visitors came yesterday, then we can calculate how many visitors came on that particular day as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit = 829 / 85 = 9.7 (round off to 10) Therefore, approximately 10 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends had their good meal.
Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings at the Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that 557 visitors came to the palace that day. So, if we want to find out how many visitors visited the palace in total during those 57 days, we can use the following equation: Number of visitors = Total number of paintings x Visitors per painting / Number of days The problem is asking us to find out how many visitors visited the palace in 57 days, so we will plug in the values given in the problem: Number of visitors = 71 x (557 / 188) / 57 = 3904 Therefore, according to the information provided in the question, there were approximately 3904 visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace during those 57 days.
Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings at the Buckingham Palace and 661 visitors came to see them that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then we can find out how many more visitors came to the palace that day as follows: Number of visitors today = Number of visitors yesterday + (Number of paintings x Visitors per painting) So, if there were 600 visitors yesterday, and each painting was visited by 2 people on average (which is what the question assumes), then the number of visitors today would be: Number of visitors today = 600 + (39 x 2) = 600 + 78 = 678 visitors Today, 678 visitors came to see the paintings at Buckingham Palace, compared to 600 visitors the previous day.
Response:  We know that there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that. So, in total, there were 522 visitors during those two days. Now, we are asked how many visitors came to the palace before the day of the meal. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the day of the meal (92) from the total number of visitors during the two previous days (522 - 92 = 430). Therefore, the answer is 430 visitors came to the Palace of Buckingham before the day of the meal.
Response:  We know that there are three days in total (yesterday, today, and tomorrow). So, we can write down the following equation:  Number of visitors yesterday + Number of visitors today = Total number of visitors over the last 89 days  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Number of visitors yesterday = 471  Number of visitors today = 512  Therefore, the total number of visitors over the last 89 days is: 471 + 512 = 983  So, there were 983 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham during the last 89 days.
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to the palace on the day in question. If we add this number to the total number of visitors from the previous two days (191 + 457 = 648), then we have a total of 705 + 648 = 1353 visitors to the palace over the past 245 days. Therefore, the answer is 1353.
Response:  We know that the next item in the list is wax to join feathers. The wax requires an additional 159 grams of cera. So, if the feathers require a total of 628 grams of cera, how many grams of cera does he have?  Solution: To find out how many grams of cera the person has, we need to subtract the amount of cera required for the wax from the total amount of cera required for the feathers. Therefore, the number of grams of cera the person has is: 628 - 159 = 469 grams.
Response:  We know that the total amount of materials needed is 49g of paint and 288g of wax. So far, he has 260g of wax, which means he still needs 128g more to complete the task. Therefore, the answer is 128g.
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed to glue all the feathers is 57g + 22g = 79g. Since each feather requires 353g of wax, we can calculate how many feathers there are by dividing the total amount of wax by the amount of wax required for one feather: 79g / 353g = x. Therefore, there are x feathers in total.
"Response:  If it takes 166 grams of wax to join 5 feathers, and now you need 20 grams more, then...  So, the number of feathers that can be joined with the additional 20 grams of wax is:

$ \boxed {5 + \frac{20}{166} = 5 + \frac{1}{4} = 6 $} $

Therefore, the person needs an additional $ $\boxed {6}$ $ $ grams of wax to join the remaining feathers."
Response:  We know that the number of grams of wax needed to glue all the feathers together is equal to the remaining amount of wax after the beak and tail have been glued (in this case, 530 grams). So, we can calculate the number of grams of wax needed for each feather as follows: Number of grams of wax needed = Remaining amount of wax / Total number of feathers To find out how many feathers there are, let's use the information given in the problem: There are 28 feathers in total. Now, let's divide the total number of feathers by the number of feathers that can be glued with one gram of wax: Number of feathers that can be glued with one gram of wax = Total number of feathers / Number of grams of wax needed For example, if we need 17 grams of wax to glue all the feathers together, then we can calculate the number of feathers that can be glued with one gram of wax as follows: Number of feathers that can be glued with one gram of wax = 28 feathers / 17 grams = 1.6 feathers per gram Of course, since we don't want to round up or down to a whole number of feathers, we will round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, the number of feathers that can be glued with one gram of wax is approximately 1.5 feathers. Now, let's return to our original calculation: Number of grams of wax needed = Remaining amount of wax / Total number of feathers Using the values provided earlier, we get: Number of grams of wax needed = 530 grams / 28 feathers = 19 grams per feather Since we need 17 grams of wax in total to glue all the feathers together, we can calculate the number of feathers that can be glued with the available wax as follows: Number of feathers that can be glued with the available wax = Total amount of wax needed / Amount of wax needed per feather Number of feathers that can be glued with the available wax = 17 grams / 19 grams per feather = 
Response:  We know that the bird needs 492 grams of cere to glue all its feathers.  If it currently has 11 grams of cere, we need to find out how many more grams it needs.  To do this, we can divide the amount of cere needed (492 grams) by the amount of cere it already has (11 grams):  Number of additional grams = 492 - 11 = 481 grams So, the bird needs 481 grams more of cere to glue all its feathers.
Response:  If there are 94 wineries and they send 90 barrels of wine in 6 days, that means each winery sends an average of 15 barrels of wine per day (90/94 = 15).
Response:  The winemaker visited 266 vineyards and found out that in 5 days they could fill 90 barrels of wine. So, we can calculate how many barrels each day were filled as follows: Number of barrels per day = Total number of barrels / Number of days = 90 barrels / 5 days = 18 barrels per day
"Response:  If they sell 244 caskets of wine every day and there are 146 days in a period, then the total number of caskets sold during that time is:

$$ Number = \text {Total Days} \times \text{Number of Caskets Sold Per Day } $$

$$= 146 \times 244 = 35,084 \text{ caskets} $$

Therefore, $35,084$ caskets of wine would be sold during the given period."
Response:  The seller said that they sell 100 cannons of strawberries and 221 cannons of grapes every day. To find out how many barrels of wine are sold in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of cannons of each fruit by the number of days. So, the total number of cannons of strawberries is 100 x 77 = 7700, and the total number of cannons of grapes is 221 x 77 = 16,477. Finally, we divide the total number of cannons by the capacity of one barrel (which is usually around 100 liters) to get the total number of barrels of wine sold: 7700 / 100 = 77 barrels. Therefore, in 77 days, 77 barrels of wine are sold.
Response:  The seller said that he sold 108 barrels of wine every day and visited 57 vineyards in total. So, we can calculate how many barrels he sold at each vineyard as follows: Number of barrels sold per vineyard = Total number of barrels sold / Number of vineyards visited = 108 barrels/day x 57 vineyards = 6,368 barrels Since there are 42 gallons in a barrel, we can convert this amount to gallons as follows: Gallons = Barrels x Gallons per barrel = 6,368 barrels x 42 gallons/barrel = 269,392 gallons Therefore, the seller labeled and sold 269,392 gallons of wine over 58 days.
Response:  If there are 36 sellers who can sell 8 barrels of wine per day, then in one day they will be able to sell 36 x 8 = 288 barrels of wine.  To fill 240 cisterns with wine, it will take 240 / 288 = 81 days.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals as the total number of animals in all the aquariums. So, if we divide the total number of animals (52) by the number of aquariums (26), we get the average number of animals in each aquarium: 52 / 26 = 2 Therefore, each aquarium has 2 animals of saltwater.
Response:  We have 40 animals in total and each aquarium has 2 animals. So, we need to divide 40 by 2 to find out how many aquariums there are. Therefore, there were 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tyler had 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 39 animals. So, we can calculate the total number of animals as follows: Saltwater animals = 56 x 39 = 2174 Freshwater animals = 10 x 39 = 390 Total number of animals = 2174 + 390 = 2564 Therefore, Tyler has 2564 animals in his aquariums.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 22 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals. Therefore, the total number of saltwater animals owned by Tyler is:  Number of saltwater aquariums = 22  Animals in each aquarium = 46  Total number of saltwater animals =  Number of saltwater aquariums x Number of animals in each aquarium = 22 x 46 = 952 animals
"Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 19 animals, so we can write down this information as follows:
Saltwater animals: 15 x 19 = 285 animals Freshwater animals: 62 x 19 = 1174 animals In total, then, there are 285 + 1174 = 1459 animals."
Response:  If we have 39 white shirts and they come in packs of 13, then... We can divide 39 by 13 to find out how many packs we will have: 39 / 13 = 3 So, if the mother buys 39 white shirts, she will have 3 packs.
Response:  If there are 66 white shirts and each pack has 3 white shirts, then we can divide 66 by 3 to find out how many packs there are: 66 / 3 = 22 So, there will be 22 packs of white shirts.
Response:  If the mother buys 28 packs of white shirts and each package contains 56 white shirts in total, then we can calculate how many white shirts are in each package as follows: Number of white shirts per package = Total number of white shirts / Number of packages = 56 / 28 = 2 White shirts per package. Therefore, there are 2 white shirts in each package.
"Response:  If we have 57 packages of white shirts and each package contains 53 shirts, then we have in total:

57 x 53 = 2911 white shirts

So, if the mother buys 34 pairs of pants, she will have 34 - 2911 = -2870 white shirts left."
Response:  If la mare (the mother) buys 51 white shirts, she will buy them in packages of 3 shirts per package. Therefore, she will have 51 / 3 = 17 packages of shirts.
Response:  If the mother buys 70 white shirts in total and each package contains x white shirts, then we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of white shirts = Number of packages x Number of white shirts per package 70 = x \* 14  Now, let's solve for x. We know that the total number of white shirts is 70, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 70 = x \* 14  Divide both sides of the equation by 14 to isolate x: x = 70 / 14  Therefore, there are 5 white shirts in each package (x = 5).
Response:  We have 4 bosses and each boss has an equal number of galets (let's call it x). So, we can write the equation: 4bosses = 36galets. Now, since each boss has the same amount of galets, we can divide the total number of galets among the bosses: 36galets / 4bosses = xgalets per boss. Therefore, each boss has 9 galets (x=9).
Response:  If we have 33 gallettes and each bossa contains 11 gallettes, then... We can write an equation using multiplication: 33 + 33 = 66 (total number of gallettes) Now, let's divide the total number of gallettes by the number of bosses: 66 / 4 = 16 (number of bosses of gallettes) Therefore, there will be 16 bosses of gallettes.
"Response:  If each bossa has 41 galetes and you have 53 galetes in total, then we can calculate how many bossas you have as follows:

Number of bosses = Total number of galetes / Number of galetes per bossa
= 53 / 41
= 1.29 (round to nearest whole number)
So, you have approximately 1 bossa more than the number of galetes you have."
Response:  If you have 14 galetes in total and each bossa has the same number of galetes as there are bosses (7), then we can write an equation using the information given in the question: Total number of galetes = Number of galetes per bossa x Number of bosses 14 = x x 7  To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by the number of bosses: 14 / x = 7 / x  Now, simplify the right-hand side of the equation: 2 = x Solving for x, we get that each bossa has 2 galetes. Therefore, if you have 14 galetes in total and 7 bosses, each bossa has 2 galetes.
Response:  If each bossa has 3 galetes and we have in total 21 galetes, then...
Response:  We have 10 bosses of galleys and each boss has 26 galleys. So we can calculate how many galleys there are in total as follows:  Galleys = Number of bosses x Number of galleys per boss  Galleys = 10 x 26  Galleys = 260 galleys. Therefore, you have 260 bosses of galleys.
Response:  We have 10 bosses of galetes and each boss has 14 galetes. So, in total we have 10 x 14 = 140 galetes. Now, we know that we have 28 + 86 = 114 candies in total. Since there are no other types of candy besides galetes, all the remaining candies must be galetes. Therefore, we can conclude that we have 114 - 140 = -26 galetes left. But since we cannot have negative number of galetes, it means that we have 26 bosses of galetes.
Response:  If there are x houses in one block and he gives 25 letters to each house, then he will give a total of 25x letters to all the houses in one block. So, if there are y blocks in total, then the total number of letters given by the mailman is 25y. Therefore, the number of houses in one block is x/y.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and he has to give 9 pieces of mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of mail he needs to give is:

20 x 9 = 180 pieces of mail
So, he will not have any extra pieces of mail left over after giving them all away."
Response:  If there are n houses in total and each house receives 24 pieces of mail per block, then we need to divide the total number of pieces of mail (n x 24) equally among all the houses. Therefore, each house will receive $\frac{n \times 24}{n}$ = $24$ pieces of mail.
Response:  If there are $n$ houses in a block and the messenger sends $14$ messages to each house, then the total number of messages sent is $\text{14n}$. Since the messenger has to give $2$ pieces of mail to each block, the total number of pieces of mail given is $\text{2n}$. Therefore, the number of houses in each block is $\frac{\text{2n}}{\text{14}}$.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and each house needs 32 pieces of mail, then the total number of pieces of mail needed for all blocks is:

20 x 32 = 640 pieces of mail
So, the carrier has to give 640 pieces of mail to each block."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many pieces of mail each block will receive in total. Since there are 78 blocks and each block receives 30 pieces of mail, then the total number of pieces of mail that each block will receive is: 78 x 30 = 2340 pieces of mail. Now, since there are 19 houses in each block, and each house does not want any extra piece of mail, then the number of pieces of mail that each house will receive is: 2340 / 19 = 120 pieces of mail per house. Therefore, each house will receive 120 pieces of mail.
Response:  The carrier has to give 8 pieces of mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 32 pieces of mail to every house in one block, then there are 32/8 = 4 houses in one block. Therefore, there are 55 x 4 = 220 houses in all the blocks together.
Response:  There are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses. So, the total number of pieces of mail that the carrier needs to deliver is 81 x 12 = 972 pieces of mail. Therefore, the carrier will have 972 - 4 = 968 pieces of mail left over after delivering all the mail to each house in every block.
Response:  The carrier has to give 4 pieces of mail to each house in each of the 16 blocks. Since there are 17 houses in each block, the carrier will have to give 4 x 17 = 68 pieces of mail in total. So, the carrier will not want to give 68 - 4 = 64 pieces of mail.
Response:  We know that we have to divide the collection of notes into groups of 4. To do this, we will use all the eggs and all the sticks. So, we can create 4 groups of 4 notes each. Therefore, there will be 4 groups.
Response:  We know that La Rebecca has 10 pebbles and 15 eggs to divide into groups of 5. To find out how many groups we can create, we need to divide 15 by 5. When we do this, we get 3. So, La Rebecca can create 3 groups of 5 eggs each or 15 eggs in total.
Response:  If we divide a collection of eggs into groups of 11, then each group will have 2 eggs. So, if there are x eggs in total, then each group will have 2x/11 eggs. Since there are 11 groups, the total number of eggs is 11(2x)/11 = 2x eggs. Therefore, Rebecca has 2x eggs.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and 6 boletes ( Spanish for mushrooms). If we want to divide them into four groups of equal size, each group will have how many eggs?  To find out, let's divide 8 eggs by 4 groups: 8 / 4 = 2 eggs per group. So each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that La Rebecca has 4 bolets and 15 ous. She wants to divide them into 3 groups. So we need to find out how many ous each group will have.  Group 1: 4 bolets x 15 ous = 60 ous Group 2: 4 bolets x 15 ous = 60 ous Group 3: 4 bolets x 15 ous = 60 ous Therefore, each group will have 60 ous.
Response:  We know that we have to divide the eggs into groups of 6. So, firstly, we will divide all the eggs equally among themselves and make one group. Now, let's see how many groups we can create with these eggs. The number of eggs is equal to 18. If we divide them equally among themselves, then each egg will be in one group. Therefore, there will be only one group.  So, the correct answer is 1 group.
Response:  We have to divide the collection of eggs into groups of three. So we need to find out how many groups we can make with 3 eggs each.  To do this, we will use the following formula: Number of groups = Total number of eggs / 3 (number of eggs in each group)  In this case, the total number of eggs is 99 + 9 + 27 = 135 eggs.  Therefore, the number of groups we can create is: Number of groups = 135 / 3 = 45 groups  So, there will be 45 groups of three eggs each.
Response:  We know that La Rebecca wants to divide the collection of eggs into groups of 5. Since she has 20 eggs in total and 6 bolets (pearls), we can assume that each group will contain 5 eggs + 1 pearl = 6 eggs + 1 pearl. Therefore, La Rebecca has 20 - 6 = 14 eggs left after dividing them into groups of 5. So, La Rebecca has 14 more eggs than the peas.
Response:  We know that La Rebecca has 5 bolets and 12 ous. If she divides them into groups of 20, then each group will have 20/5 = 4 ous from her collection. So, the number of ous more than the perls that La Rebecca has is:  Number of ous in total - Number of ous in each group = 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, La Rebecca has 8 more eggs than peas.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and won 11 points in each round, then he played $154 / 11 = 14$ rounds. Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds of the game.
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game and won $46 points in each round, then he scored a total of:
$$ Total = \sum_{r=1}^{177} 46 $$
Substituting the value of $r$ (the number of rounds) with $177$, we get:
$$ Total = 177 \times 46 = 8232 $$
Therefore, Luke scored a total of $8232$ points in the game."
"Response:  If Luke got 84 points after playing two rounds of trivia and he won the same number of points each round, then we can write an equation based on this information:
Points = Number of Rounds x Points per Round
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Points = 2 x 84
Simplifying, we have:
Points = 168
Therefore, if Luke won $84 for every round he played, he would have earned a total of $168."
Response:  If Luke gained 146 points in each round of the game and played for 157 rounds, then he must have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,892 points in the entire game.
Response:  If Luke scored 78 points in a game of trivia and he won 3 points in each round, then he played $ \text {number} $ of rounds to score 78 points. So, we can write an equation as follows: $\boxed{\text{Number of rounds}} = \frac{\text{Total points}}{\text{Points per round}}$ $= \frac{78}{3}$ $= 26$ rounds. Therefore, Luke played $26$ rounds to score $78$ points.
Response:  If Emily had two perls and wanted to make 32 collars, she needed 16 more perls (32 - 2 = 16). So, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Emily made 11 collars and each collar has 28 beads... So, in total, she had to make 11 x 28 = 298 beads!
Response:  If Emily has 16 perles and each collar has 8 perles, then she can make 16 / 8 = 2 collars. Therefore, Emily can make 2 collars.
Response:  If Emily made 18 collars and had 6 perls, then she needed 18 / 6 = 3 perls for each collar. So, to make one collar, Emily needs 3 perls.
Response:  If Emily made four collarets with 5 perles each, then she had 4 x 5 = 20 perles in total. So, the answer is 20.
Response:  If Emily has 6 perls and each collar has 3 perls, then she can make 6 x 3 = 18 collars.
Response:  If Emily had 5 perls and she was able to make 20 collars, then each collar requires how many perls? We can divide the total number of perls (5) by the number of collars made (20):  Number of perls required for each collar = Total number of perls / Number of collars made = 5 / 20 = 1/4 or 0.25 perls per collar.
Response:  We know that Emily is making bracelets for her 44 friends and she has made 26 of them so far. Since each bracelet has 2 beads, we can conclude that Emily has used 2 x 44 = 96 beads in total. So, there are 96 beads in total.
Response:  We know that there were 819058 children in the county of Lawrence and 668278 children who stayed at home during summer break. So, we need to find out how many more children went to the camp than those who stayed at home. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of children who went to the camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Now let's plug in the values we have: Number of children who went to the camp = 819058 - 668278 = 150783 Therefore, 150783 more children went to the camp than stayed at home.
Response:  We know that out of 1000 children in the county of Lawrence, 3426 went to summer camp and 777622 stayed at home. So, we can say that 777622 - 3426 = 743396 more children stayed at home than went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in the county of Lawrence. During the summer holidays, 629,424 children go to camp and the remaining stay at home. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of children at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children at home = 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627 children. Therefore, there are 268,627 children who stay at home during the summer holidays in the County of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that during summer break, 274.865 children stay at home while the rest go to camp. So, if we want to find out how many children went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children in the county. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home  = 313.473 - 274.865  = 38.608
Response:  We know that during summer break 907611 children from Lawrence County stay at home and the other 455682 children go to camp. So, in total there are 90761 + 455682 = 546393 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that during summer break, 8000 children from Lawrence County went to camp and the remaining stayed at home. The total number of children in Lawrence County is 828521. So, we can calculate the number of children who stayed at home as follows: Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp = 828521 - 8000 = 748521 Therefore, 748521 children stayed at home during summer break in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that during summer break in 1961 there were 6169 children in the county of Lawrence and the rest went to camp. The total number of children in the county is 91676. So, we can calculate the percentage of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children x Percentage of children who went to camp = 91676 x (6169/Total number of children) = 5482. Therefore, about 5482 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp.
"Response:  We know that out of 35,932 children in the county, 3,4044 went to summer camp and 13,4867 stayed at home. That means there are 22,547 children left who did not go to camp. Now we need to find out how many children from outside the county attended the camp. The passage says ""424944 children from outside the county also attended."" So, the total number of children who attended the camp is equal to the number of children from inside the county plus the number of children from outside the county: Total = Inside + Outside = 22,547 + 424,944 = 447,481. Therefore, 447,481 children attended the summer camp."
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children in the county of Lawrence, 300000 (about half) went to summer camp and the remaining 310769 stayed at home. Now we need to find out how many children are left in the county after subtracting those who attended the camp from the total number of children in the county. So, let's do this: Total number of children in the county = 610769 - 300000 = 310769 Children left in the county = 310769 / 2 = 155884 Therefore, there are approximately 155884 children left in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children in the county of Lawrence during summer break.  Of these, 893835 went to camp.  So, how many stayed at home?  To find out, we need to subtract the number who went to camp from the total number of children in the county: 644997 - 893835 = 155602. Therefore, there are 155602 children left in the county of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 3 = 9 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 9 - (x+3) = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has.  Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Adam has (10) and the number of apples Jackie has (2) is:  10 - 2 = 8  So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:  9 (Adam) - 10 (Jackie) = -1   Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. So, to find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has.  Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Jackie has (10) and the number of apples Adam has (8) is 2.  Hence, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together, then they have 6/2 = 3 apples between them.  Since Adam has 4 more apples than he shares with Jackie, Adam has 3 + 4 = 7 apples in total.  So, the number of apples Adam and Jackie have together is 6, and Adam has 7 apples in total.
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. So, if they are together with another person (let's call him/her ""T""), then T must have at least 1 apple from Adam or Jackie. Therefore, the total number of apples among Adam, Jackie, and T is 7 + 1 = 8. Since there are 9 people in total, each person has an average of 0.9 apples (since we can divide 9 by 3). So, the final answer is 8 / 3 = 2.67 apples per person."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples.  If Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie has 4 apples (since Adam has 8 more than Jackie). So, in total, they have 12 + 4 = 16 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 apples more than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 10 apples, then Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples. Now we are told that Adam and Jackie together have 2 apples more than they have individually. So, if Adam has 14 apples, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 apples with Jackie. Therefore, Adam has 12 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 5 apples and less than or equal to 6 (since we were told that Jackie has 89 tangerines). So, let's assume that Adam has x apples. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Apples owned by Adam = x + 5 Since Jackie has 89 tangerines, we can subtract this amount from Adam's total number of fruits to find out how many apples he has: Apples owned by Adam = x + 5 - 89 =? Now, we are asked to determine the value of x. To do so, we need to use the information provided in the problem that Adam has more than 5 apples and less than or equal to 6. Therefore, we can narrow down the possible values of x as follows: x ≤ 6 Since Adam has more than 5 apples, we know that x > 5. So, the possible values of x are {6, 7, 8, 9}. Now, let's check each of these possibilities: If x = 6, then Adam has 6 + 5 = 11 apples. But this is greater than the number of tangerines Jackie has (89), which means it cannot be the correct solution. If x = 7, then Adam has 7 + 5 = 12 apples. This is also greater than the number of tangerines Jackie has, so it cannot be the correct solution. If x = 8, then Adam has 8 + 5 = 13 apples. Again, this is greater than the number of tangerines Jackie has, so it cannot be the correct solution. If x = 9, then Adam has 9 + 5 = 14 apples. Finally, we have found a possibility where Adam's apple count is less than or equal to the number of tangerines Jackie has: Adam has 9 + 5 = 14 apples. Therefore, the answer to the question is 14.
Response:  Ahir (yesterday) means that the action happened before the current day. So, if today is Monday, then yesterday was Sunday.  Now, let's count the number of galetes Helen made each day:  • Yesterday (Sunday): 31 + 270 = 291 galetes  • Today (Monday): 419 galetes  Therefore, the number of galetes Helen made yesterday (Sunday) is 291.
Response:  Yesterday (ahir), Helen made 90 chocolate cookies. Today (aquest matí), she made 51 chocolate cookies and 484 chocolate cookies in total. So, the total number of chocolate cookies that Helen made is: 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 86 raisin cookies and 554 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen made 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday (ahir), Helen made 144 galetes of chocolate and 397 galetes of raisin galets. Today (aquest matí), she baked 85 galetes of raisins and 403 galetes of chocolate galets. So, if we subtract the number of galetes that Helen made yesterday from the total number of galetes she made today, we get: Total number of galetes made today - Number of galetes made yesterday = 403 - 144 = 263 galetes of raisins. Therefore, Helen made 263 galetes of raisins today.
Response:  Yesterday (ahir), Helen made 19 galetes of chocolate. Today (aquest matí), she made 237 galetes of chocolate. So, the difference between the number of galetes of chocolate made yesterday and today is: 237 - 19 = 218 galetes of chocolate. Therefore, Helen made 218 more galetes of chocolate than she did uva pastry.
Response:  Ahir (yesterday), Helen made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 raisin cookies. Today, she has cooked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate cookies. So, the difference between the number of chocolate cookies Helen made yesterday and today is: 75 - 197 = -122. Therefore, Helen made fewer chocolate cookies yesterday than today.
Response:  Ahir (yesterday), Helen made 519 galetes of chocolate and 300 galetes of raisins. Today, she has baked 280 galetes of raisins and 359 galetes of chocolate. So, the difference between what Helen made yesterday and today is: 519 - 280 = 239 galetes of raisins more than what Helen made today compared to yesterday.
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, we need to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games their old friends have. According to the question, their old friends have 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games that all three groups of friends have is 179 (Katie and new friends) + 53 (old friends) = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games. Now we need to find out how many old games Katie has. According to the question, she has 86 old games. Therefore, the total number of games Katie has is 126 (new) + 86 (old) = 212 games.
Response:  Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19). Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69). Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77).
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games. So, we need to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has: 63 - 57 = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, in total, Katie has 57 + 34 = 91 games. Now we need to find out how many old games Katie has. According to the question, she has 39 old games. Therefore, Katie has 91 (new) + 39 (old) = 130 games in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19 before they started working. Then, Jason earned $33 after he worked as a car washer. So, the total amount of money that Fred and Jason have now is: $60 + $19 = $79. Therefore, Jason gained $33 from renting cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $86 last week and then he earned $9 more this week. So, his current amount is $95 = $86 + $9.  Now, let's find out how much money Jason has. According to the question, Jason didn't work last week so he still has $5. Therefore, their total amount of money together is $95 (Fred) + $5 (Jason) = $100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 dollars before he started working and Jason had $16 dollars. Then they worked together for a week and now Fred has $40 dollars and Jason has $69 dollars. So, to find out how much money Fred gained this week, we need to subtract his initial amount from his current amount: $40 - $19 = $21. Therefore, Fred gained $21 dollars this week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 initially and spent some money during the weekend. Then he earned $21 from renting cars. So his new amount of money is: $114 + $21 = $135. Similarly, Jason started with $22 and earned $78 from renting cars. Therefore, his new amount of money is: $22 + $78 = $90. Now, to find out how much money each person gained or lost, we need to subtract their initial amount from their new amount: $135 - $114 = $21 (Fred gained $21) $90 - $22 = $68 (Jason gained $68).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 last week and he earned $4 this week, so his new amount of money is:  $111 + $4 = $115.  Now, we need to find out how much money Jason gained this week. We know that he had $40 last week and he didn't earn anything this week, so his new amount of money is still $40. Therefore, the difference in money between Fred and Jason is:  $115 - $40 = $75. So, Fred gained $75 by washing cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 before he started working as a car washer. Then, he earned $73 for the week (since he made $112 - $49). Therefore, Jason earned $63 ($73 - $10) for delivering newspapers during the same week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $31 and Fred had $78 before they started working together. Then, Jason gave $14 to Fred, so now Jason has $31 - $14 = $17 left. Now, Fred rented cars over the weekend and earned $90, so he has $90 + $78 = $168 now. So, the amount of money they gained from giving diaries is $17 (Jason) + $168 (Fred) = $185.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $33 dollars before making any deliveries or working as a car cleaner. Then he made $16 in delivery and $74 in cleaning cars, so his total earnings for the week are: $33 + $16 = $49 dollars. Therefore, Fred gained $49 dollars this week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and then he earned $111 from delivering newspapers. So his new amount of money is:  $$Fred = 47 + 111 = 158$$  Now, let's consider what happened this week. He also earned $34 from washing cars. Therefore, his current balance is:  $$Fred = 158 + 34 = 192$$  So, Fred has $192 now.
"Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg before starting to run every day and she lost 20 kilograms after doing so, then her current weight is:

Jessie's current weight = Original weight - Weight loss
= 71 kg - 20 kg
= 51 kg

Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 51 kg."
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 34 kg (27 + 7).
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 88 kg (as stated in the question). After running every day for some time, she lost 126 kilograms and now weighs 66 kilograms. Therefore, her weight before starting to run was 88 kg - 66 kg = 22 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 69 kg (152 lbs). After running every day for some time, she lost 35 kg (77 lbs) of weight. So, her current weight is: 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg (75 lbs)
Response:  First week, she lost 50kg = 50/7 = 7.14 kg per day. Second week, she lost 60kg = 60/7 = 8.57 kg per day. So in total, after two weeks, she lost 50 + 60 = 110 kg or 110/7 = 15.71 kg per day. Therefore, her current weight is 114 - 15.71 = 98.29 kg.
Response:  First week: $ \text{Jessie lost } 62\text{ kilograms} = 0.62\text{ kg/day}$ Second week: $\text{Jessie lost } 140\text{ kilograms} = 1.40\text{ kg/day}$ Total weight loss in two weeks: $\text{Total weight loss } = 0.62\text{ kg/day} + 1.40\text{ kg/day} = 1.85\text{ kg/day}$ Since Jessie weighed $9\text{ kg}$ initially, she lost $\text{Total weight loss } \times \text{Time taken to lose weight} = 1.85\text{ kg/day} \times 2\text{ weeks} = 3.7$ kilograms during the two-week period. Therefore, her initial weight was $9 - 3.7 = 5.3\text{ kg}$.
Response:  First week: $Jessie$ weighed $92kg$. Then she lost $\frac{56}{1}$ kilograms in the first week, so her weight after one week is: $$W_1 = W_0 - \frac{56}{1} = 92 - \frac{56}{1} = 36$$  Second week: $Jessie$ weighed $36kg$. Then she lost $\frac{99}{1}$ kilograms in the second week, so her weight after two weeks is: $$W_2 = W_1 - \frac{99}{1} = 36 - \frac{99}{1} = 64$$ Therefore, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed $36kg$, and after the second week, she weighed $64kg$.
Response:  If we hide 64 snakes among the remaining 31 snakes (i.e., 95 - 64 = 31), then there will be a total of 64 + 31 = 95 snakes left in the enclosure. So, the number of snakes that are not hidden is 95 - 64 = 31.
Response:  We know that there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators in the cage. If 40 wolves were hiding, then we can deduce that there were 53 wolves not hiding (since 40 is less than 93). So, there were 53 wolves not hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 82 snakes and 19 alligators hiding in the cage. If we subtract the number of alligators from the total number of animals, we get:  Number of snakes = 82 - 19 = 63  Therefore, there are 63 alligators not hidden in the cage.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the cage and we have already counted 24 snakes and 51 horses. So, the number of remaining animals is: 79 - 24 = 55. Therefore, there are 55 non-snake, non-horse animals in the cage.
Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and today he has 30 more. So, the total number of tomatoes he has now is:  Yesterday: 171 + Today: 30 = 201 tomatoes. Therefore, after today, the farmer will have 201 - 134 = 67 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  If he had 160 tomatoes in his garden and he chose 56 of them yesterday, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden today.
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he chose 154 of them today. So, the number of tomatoes he has chosen is 154 - 90 = 64. Now, we need to add the number of tomatoes he had yesterday (90) to the number of tomatoes he has chosen today (64), which gives us a total of 90 + 64 = 154 tomatoes that the farmer has collected in total.
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 172 potatoes, how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left? We can start by subtracting the number of potatoes he collected from the total number of potatoes he had:  Number of potatoes he has left = Total number of potatoes - Number of potatoes collected = 77 - 172 = -95 potatoes He cannot collect more potatoes than he has in his garden, so the negative sign indicates that he now has fewer potatoes than he started with. Now let's check how many tomatoes he has left. Since he did not collect any tomatoes, he still has all 175 tomatoes he had initially. So, to summarize: Farmer has -95 potatoes and 175 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 53 tomatoes, then he has X number of tomatoes left. Since we know that the total number of tomatoes was 177, we can write an equation: 177 - 53 = X. Solving for X, we get: X = 124. So, the farmer now has 124 tomatoes in his garden. Similarly, if he collected 53 tomatoes, then he must have had Y number of tomatoes before collection, where Y is equal to 124 minus the number of tomatoes he collected. In this case, Y = 124 - 53 = 71. Therefore, the farmer had 71 patatoes in his garden before collecting any tomatoes.
Response:  The farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he collected 137 tomatoes, then he must have collected both green and red ones. So, let's say he collected x green tomatoes and y red tomatoes. Since we know that the total number of tomatoes he collected is 137, we can write the equation:  x + y = 137. Now, we are also given that the farmer started with 105 green tomatoes, so the number of green tomatoes he collected is: x = 105 - 105 = 0. Therefore, the number of red tomatoes he collected is: y = 71. So, the farmer has 0 green tomatoes left and 71 red tomatoes left.
Response:  If four keys are needed to cut large wooden planks and each plank requires two key pieces to be fixed, then we can calculate as follows: Number of planks = Total number of keys / Number of key pieces required per plank. In this case, the calculation would be: Number of planks = 4 keys / 2 key pieces/plank = 2 planks. Therefore, John needs 2 planks of wood for the wall of the house.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden beams in total and each beam needs 17 pieces of keys to be fixed. So, we need 
$$ \text {13} \times \text{17} = 201 $$  pieces of keys for all the big beams. Now, we also know that some of these beams have smaller parts that require additional 8 keys each. So, we need an extra amount of keys for those small parts, which is equal to the number of small parts multiplied by 8. Therefore, the total number of keys needed by John is: 
$$ \text {Total } = \text {201} + (\text {Number of small parts} \times \text{8}) $$ "
Response:  We know that per each large piece of wood (fusta), John needed 3 pieces of keys to be fixed. So, for 8 additional claves used, he needed 8 x 3 = 24 pieces of keys. Now we need to find out how many planks John needs for the wall of the house. Since we are told that John used 11 keys in total, and he needed 24 keys for the additional pieces of wood, then he must have used 11 - 24 = -13 keys for the wall of the house. Therefore, John does not need any planks for the wall of the house.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many big planks are needed for one wall. Since there are 12 large planks and each needs 15 keys to be fixed, therefore, the total number of keys required for one wall is:

12 large planks x 15 keys/plank = 180 keys

Now, let's move on to the small planks. There are 10 small planks, and each needs 5 keys to be fixed. Therefore, the total number of keys required for all ten small planks is:

10 small planks x 5 keys/plank = 50 keys

So, in total, John needs 180 + 50 = 230 keys to fix both walls."
Response:  We know that each piece of wood needs two screws to be fixed, so we need 2 x 16 = 32 screws in total. Therefore, John needs 32 clavess for the wall of the house.
Response:  We know that for each large wooden board (fusta), John needs 74 pieces of screws to fix it to the wall. So, if we have 8 large wooden boards, John will need a total of 74 x 8 = 592 pieces of screws. Therefore, John needs 592 fustes to cover the entire wall.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large boards and 17 small boards needed for the wall of the house.  Each large board requires 14 keys to be fixed, so we need 12 x 14 = 168 keys for the large boards. Similarly, each small board requires 25 keys, so we need 17 x 25 = 425 keys in total. Now, we have to find out how many planks John needs to buy. Since he only has 425 keys available, he can only use them to fix 425 / 168 = 2.5 large boards or 2.5 x 17 = 42.5 small boards. Therefore, John needs 42 large boards or 42 x 1 = 42 planks.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of gum in each pack and a total of 42 pieces of gum. To find out how many packets Robin has, we can divide the number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each packet:  Number of packets = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per packet  Number of packets = 42 / 3  Number of packets = 14 So, Robin has 14 packets of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of chewing gum and each package contains 23 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is:  Number of packages = 43  x Number of pieces per package = 23  So, Robin has 43 x 23 = 991 pieces of chewing gum.
Response:  We know that there are seven pieces of gum in each pack and Robin has six packs. So, the number of pieces of gum Robin has is 6 x 7 = 42. Since we were asked how many packets Robin has, we can conclude that he has one packet. Therefore, Robin has one packet of gum with 7 pieces inside.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces of gum. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is:

$$ 21 \times 9 = 189 $$

Now, we also know that Robin has 45 packages of caramels, and each package contains 9 pieces of caramel. Therefore, the total number of pieces of caramel that Robin has is:

$$ 45 \times 9 = 395 $$

So, in total, Robin has $ 189 + 395 = 584 $ pieces of candy."
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of caramel. Since there are 6 pieces in each package, we can write an equation as follows: Gum pieces = 28 x 6 = 168 Caramel pieces = 14 x 6 = 84 Now we have two equations and two unknowns (gum pieces and caramel pieces). To solve for both variables, we add the two equations together and eliminate one variable: 168 + 84 = 352 Total pieces = 352 / 2 = 176 pieces Therefore, Robin has 176 pieces of gum and caramel combined.
Response:  We know that one machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute, so it has made 6 shirts / 3 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes. So in that time, it could make 4 shirts/minutes x 5 minutes = 20 shirts. Therefore, the machine made 20 shirts during those 5 minutes.
Response:  We know that yesterday the machine made 9 shirts and today it made 44 shirts. So, if we divide the number of shirts made today by the time taken to make one shirt (which is 3 minutes), we get: Number of minutes = Number of shirts made today / Time taken to make one shirt = 44/3 = 14.67 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 15 minutes yesterday.
Response:  We know that the machine made 16 samarretes in total (13 + 3). If it can make 8 samarretes per minute, then the time taken to make all these samarretes is given by: Time = Number of samarretes / Rate at which they are made = 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine functioned for 2 minutes in total.
Response:  The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 today. So in total it has produced 9 + 8 = 17 shirts. Since it can make 2 camisoles per minute, the time taken to produce these shirts is: Time taken = Number of shirts / Rate at which they are produced = 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  If we assume that the machine can make 3 shirts in one minute and it worked for x minutes, then the number of shirts made is 3x.  Since yesterday, the machine made 4 camisoles in one minute, so the number of camisoles made is 4x.  Today, the machine made 8 camisoles in one minute, so the number of camisoles made today is 8x.  Therefore, the total number of garments made by the machine is 3x + 4x + 8x = 15x.  Now, we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked. We know that yesterday the machine worked for 2 hours (or 60 minutes), and today it worked for 4 hours (or 240 minutes). So, the total time the machine worked is 60 + 240 = 300 minutes.  Finally, we can calculate the average rate at which the machine produced garments per minute as follows: Total number of garments / Time taken to produce them = 15x / 300 minutes = 50 garments/minute.
Response:  If yesterday the machine could make 6 shirts per minute and it worked for 12 minutes, then it made a total of 6 x 12 = 72 shirts.  And if today the machine can make 14 shirts per minute and it worked for 14 minutes, then it made a total of 14 x 14 = 196 shirts. So, in total, the machine made 72 + 196 = 268 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 5 minutes and made 6 samarretes/minute, so it produced 30 samarretes (5 minutes x 6 samarretes/minute). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and also made 6 samarretes/minute, so it produced 72 samarretes (12 minutes x 6 samarretes/minute). Therefore, the total number of samarretes produced by the machine today is 72 + 30 = 102 samarretes.
Response:  The carnival wheel made the same amount of money every day. In total, they earned $165 in 5 days. So, how much did they earn per day?  To find out, we can divide the total amount they earned by the number of days they worked: $165 / 5 = $33 per day. Therefore, they earned $33 per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the Carnival game made $144 per day. Now, let's calculate how much money they earned during the entire duration of the Carnival which was for 22 days. So, the total amount of money earned can be calculated as follows: Total Amount = Number of Days x Daily Earnings Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the Carnival game is :Total Amount = 22 days x $144/day = $3,076 So, the Carnival game earned $3,076 during the entire duration of the Carnival.
Response:  The carnival wheel made $420 per day, and they played it for 30 days, so the total amount of money they won from the game was $12,600 ($420 x 30). Additionally, they won $22 per day from the ring toss game. So, the daily earnings from the ring toss game were $22 x 30 = $660. Therefore, the daily earnings from the anagram game were $660 - $22 = $638.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 44 days of operation, the game made $382. Then, in the remaining 10 days, it made $374. To find out how much money they have earned in total, we can add these two amounts together: $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the ring toss game is $756.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in total they made $120 during the first 20 days of the carnival. So, if they made $x per day during those 20 days, then we can write an equation as follows: x × 20 = $120. Now, we are also given that they made $66 during the remaining 16 days of the carnival. Therefore, we can add this amount to what they made during the first 20 days and find out how much they made overall. So, the final equation becomes: x + (66/16) = $186. Solving for x, we get: x = $93. Therefore, they made $93 per day during the first 20 days of the carnival.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, the game made $325. Therefore, the average amount earned per day during this period is:
Average daily earnings = Total amount earned / Number of days
= $325 / 154
= $2.09
Now, let's find out how much they earned each day after the first 154 days. We are given that they earned $114 in the remaining 57 days of the carnival. To calculate the average amount earned per day during these 57 days, we can use the same formula as before:
Average daily earnings = Total amount earned / Number of days
= $114 / 57
= $2.00
Therefore, the carnival game earned an average of $2.09 per day during the first 154 days and $2.00 per day during the remaining 57 days."
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packages of cookies and 4 packages of cake, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages of baked goods. So, she bought more packages of cookies than she did of cake.
Response:  La Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies, which means she bought 4 x 8 = 32 packets of cookies. She also bought 22 packs of candy and 16 packs of chocolate. So in total, she bought 32 + 22 + 16 = 70 packs of merchandise.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some number (but not necessarily equal to) of packages of candy. So far, we have 23 + x = 27, where x is the number of packages of candy she bought. Now, we are told that she also bought some number of packages of pastry. Since we already used up all of our information about the number of packages of candy, we can assume that the number of packages of pastry must be less than or equal to the difference between the total number of packages and the number of packages of cookies. Therefore, we have 23 + x = 27, where x is the number of packages of pastry. Solving for x, we get x = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packages of pastry in total.
Response:  Firstly, Lucy bought 2 packs of galets which cost $ x dollars each. Therefore, she spent $ 2x dollars on galets in total. Next, she bought 12 packets of candy which cost $ y dollars each. So, she spent $ y dollars on candies in total. Finally, she had $ 56 left after buying these items. Thus, we can write the equation: $ 2x + y = 56. Solving for y, we get: $ y = $ 56 - $ 2x. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get: $ 2x + ( $ 56 - $ 2x) = $ 56. Simplifying and solving for x, we find that Lucy spent $ 4 dollars on galets. Therefore, the answer is: Lucy bought 2 packs of galets worth $ 8 dollars in total.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry up to 36 people, we know that the number of people in the bus is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the answer is 16 people.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus and 3 people got off. So, now there are: 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got on the bus. So, now there are 17 people in the bus (4 + 13 = 17).
"Response:  Initially, there were 11 people in the train. Now, 8 more people have boarded the train, so the total number of people in the train is:

11 + 8 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 people in the train now."
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people in total. To find out how many children participated in the program, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, 654 children participated in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 724 students in the program. To find out how many people participated in the program, we need to add these two numbers together. So, the total number of people who participated in the program is: 73 + 724 = 897. Therefore, the answer is 897.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students. To find out how many more students than parents were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 521 - 174 = 347. Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents present at the event.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students also participating. The program could accommodate 44 people at most. So, we need to find out how many people are more than the capacity of the program.  To do this, we subtract the number of people who can fit in the program from the total number of participants:  Number of people more than the capacity = Total number of participants - Capacity of the program  Number of people more than the capacity = 177 - 44  = 133 Therefore, there were 133 more people than the capacity of the program.
Response:  If they have to travel 1307 feet from the entrance of the cave and the depth of the cave is 919 feet, then we can calculate the distance traveled as follows: Distance = Depth x Height + Entrance x Exit = 919 x 567 + 1307 - 1307 = 482 feet So, the end of the cave is at a distance of 482 feet from the entrance.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the depth of the cave is 460 meters and they are currently at 277 meters. To find out how many more meters they need to travel until reaching the end of the cave, we can subtract their current depth from the total depth: 460 - 277 = 183 meters. Now, if they move at a speed of 17 meters per second (which is equal to 56.67 feet per second), it will take them: 183 / 17 = 10.69 minutes to reach the end of the cave. Therefore, they will arrive in 10 minutes and 40 seconds.
Response:  We know that they are currently at an altitude of 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep. To find out when they will reach the end of the cave, we need to calculate how far they have left to go.  Distance = Depth of the cave - Current altitude = 762 - 659 = 133 feet Now, we need to convert this distance from feet to time. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Where speed is the rate at which they are climbing. Since they are climbing downwards, their speed is negative. So, let's assume their speed is -100 feet per hour. Time = 133 / (-100) = 1.33 hours Therefore, it will take them approximately 1.33 hours to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 peixos daurats in the pond (by Paige). Then, the cats left 6 of them. So, we have: Number of peixos daurats after the cats left = Initial number of peixos daurats - Number of peixos daurats left by the cats = 8 - 6 = 2 peixos daurats. Therefore, 2 peixos daurats have disappeared from the pond.
Response:  We know that La Paige had 7 fish and 12 minnows in the pond. If the cats liked to eat them, then they must have eaten some of them. So, we can say that the number of fish left after the cats ate some is: 7 - x, where x is the number of fish eaten by the cats. Now, we are told that there are 15 fish left in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 - x = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. So, the cats ate 8 fish. Hence, there are 7 fish left now.
Response:  We know that La Paige had 16 fish and 71 goldfish in the pond. If the cats liked to eat them, then we can assume that some of the fish have disappeared. So, let's count how many fish have disappeared:  Fish (16): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Goldfish (71): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Therefore, there are 13 missing fish (daurat).
Response:  We know that La Paige has raised 15 goldfish in the pond and that 5 of them have been eaten by the street cats. So, we need to find out how many goldfish are left. To do this, we can use subtraction.  Subtracting 5 from 15 gives us 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  At first, the chef had 43 apples and then he used two of them to make tarts. So, the number of apples left with him is:  $43 - 2 = 41$ apples. Therefore, the chef has 41 apples left after making the tarts.
Response:  Xefr (the person) had 58 apples to eat and after making some tarts he used 35 of them. So, how many apples are left for him to eat? We can calculate it as follows: Number of apples available = Total number of apples - Number of apples used = 58 - 35 = 23 Therefore, there are 23 apples left for Xefr to eat.
Response:  Xefr had 40 apples and made some tarts, leaving him with 39 apples. So he must have used all of his 40 apples to make the tarts. Therefore, the number of apples he used is 40.
Response:  We know that Adam has 11 figure of action in each of his shelves. So he has 11 x 4 = 44 figures of action in all four shelves. Then we have to add the number of figures of action in the drawers. There are 4 drawers and each drawer can hold 8 figures of action, so the total number of figures of action in the drawers is 4 x 8 = 32. Therefore, the total number of figures of action that Adam can have in his room is 44 + 32 = 76.
Response:  We know that Adam had 10 figures of action in each stall of his room. So, if he has 8 stalls, then he has 8 x 10 = 80 figures of action in total. Therefore, he had 80 stalls or shelves in his room.
Response:  We know that Adam has 8 figures of action and 10 armories in each explosion of his room. So, he can have up to 8 x 10 = 80 items in one explosion. Since there are 4 stalls in his room, he can have up to 80 x 4 = 320 items in total in all four stalls. Therefore, the correct answer is 320.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots. So, in total, we have 544 x 10 = 5440 pots. Since each pot contains 32 flowers, we have 5440 x 32 = 176,800 flowers in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 176,800.
Response:  We know that there are 466 pots and each pot has 53 flowers. Therefore, the number of flowers is 466 x 53 = 24,978 flowers. Now, we need to calculate the number of palms. Each flower has 181 palms, so the number of palms is 24,978 x 181 = 4,409,320 palms. So, in total, there are 24,978 flowers and 4,409,320 palms.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is: 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. Is this correct?
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total. So, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of pots to find out how many flowers are in each pot.  Therefore, the number of ollas (pots) is:  Number of ollas = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot = 400 / 40 = 10.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 Gummies in total. If we divide the number of Skittles by 154 (the number of groups), we get: Number of Skittles per group = 4502 / 154 = 29  So, each group contains 29 Skittles. Now, let's count how many groups Steven has: Number of groups = Total number of Skittles / Number of Skittles per group = 4502 / 29 = 158 groups Therefore, Steven has 158 groups of Skittles and Gummies.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 pieces of gum. If we divide the number of Skittles by the number of groups of gum, we get: Number of Skittles per group = Total number of Skittles / Number of groups of gum = 3941 / 495 = 7.82 Skittles per group. Therefore, there will be 782 groups of gum.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into groups of 8. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these Skittles. To do this, we will use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a group size or number of sets. In this case, we will divide 896 by 8 to see how many groups we can make. 896 ÷ 8 = 112 So, we can make 112 groups of 8 Skittles each!
