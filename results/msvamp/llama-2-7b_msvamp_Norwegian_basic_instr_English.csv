"Response:  If Tiffany had collected 10 bags of potatoes and said, ""Well, I'll soon make an agreement with you,"" then the next day he found 4 more bags of potatoes. If he had 6 colanders, how many colanders would he have found then?"
Response:  If Tiffany had collected $100 in coins and found 4 more hot dogs with buns afterward, how many coins would he have if he had 8 pennies in all?  Solution: Let X be the number of pennies Tiffany has at first. Since he collects $100 in coins, we can write: X + $100 = 8(p). Now, he finds 4 more hot dogs with buns, which means he gets $4 more coins. So, his new total is: X + $100 + $4 = 8(p) Substituting X = 8, we get: 8 + $100 + $4 = 8($0.5) Solving for X, we find that Tiffany has 4 pennies initially.

Response: 1067 (born)
"Response: 10543

Explanation:
The number of girls (228) is greater than half the total number of students (697), so there are more boys than girls in this school. To find out by how many boys have more than girls, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:

697 - 228 = 469

So, there are 469 boys more than girls in this school."
"Response: 274

Explanation:
The number of boys (510) is greater than the number of girls (635), so many of them are not gendered. To find out how many, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students and divide by two to get an estimate of the proportion of non-binary students. In this case, 274 boys are not gendered."

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 29"
Response: 28 (Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 sit-ups, David did 17 up-and-downs to Zachary, and he did 7 up-and-downs to you).
Response:  Yes, Zachary did more than three times as many exercises in gymnastics as David did. Specifically, Zachary did 35 exercises and 3 sit-ups, while David did 58 push-ups but fewer than 90 less than Zachary. So, Zachary did 35 + 3 = 38 exercises total, which is more than 3 times 58 = 174 exercises that David did.
"Response: 105
Question:  How many times did David beat Zachary in their daily battle of wits?  
Based on the information provided, there is no indication that David and Zachary engaged in a ""daily battle of wits."" Therefore, the answer is zero (0)."

Response: 4
Response: 40 - 9 = 31
Response: 42
"Response: 40
Explanation: If David made 56 flips over Zachary in one hour of gymnastics and if he did 38 of them over Zachary, then he would have performed 20 flips over him for every time he did a flip. Therefore, the answer is 40."
"Response: 58
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that David did 40 push-ups and sit-ups, but he failed 17 of them. Therefore, if we subtract the number of push-ups and sit-ups he failed from his total number of attempts (40), we get 23. Then, if we divide the number of successful push-ups by the number of successful sit-ups (34 / 62 = 0.58), we get an estimate of how many crunches Zachary did compared to David's push-ups."
"Response: 104
Question:  How many times did David make up and down movements to Zachary in an hour if Zachary made 58 here and there and 33 strikes more than he made strokes?  Based on the given information, we can calculate the number of times David made up and down movements as follows:
David made 36 movements up and down in an hour.
Zachary made 58 movements here and there (i.e., not including the down movements).
So, the total number of movements made by both David and Zachary is:
36 + 58 = 94
Therefore, David made up and down movements 94 times in an hour."

Response: 23 inches (14 + 17 + 15 = 23)
Response: 30 cm
Response: 30 cm
Response:  The distance traveled by frog (40 cm) is greater than the distance traveled by grasshopper (19 cm), and the distance traveled by mouse (94 cm) is less than the distance traveled by frog. Therefore, the total distance traveled by all three animals together is approximately 233 cm.
Response: 104 cm
"Response: 30 cm
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Frosken (the frog) jumped 24 times farther than Grasshopper (the grasshopper). Therefore, if Frosken jumped 10 cm further each time, then it would have jumped a total of 24 x 10 = 240 cm. Musen (the mouse), on the other hand, only jumped 10 cm less than Frosken each time, so it would have jumped a total of 240 - 10 = 230 cm. Therefore, the distance that Mouse traveled was 30 cm longer than the distance that Frog traveled."

Response: 5 glasses of flour (or 5 x 200 = 1000 grams)
Response: 50
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, if Mary has added more flour than sugar, she will need 8 additional glasses of flour."
Response:  If Mary has added more flour than sugar as instructed in the recipe and needs two cups of flour more than sugar, she can add up to three additional cups of flour.
Response: 3/2 = 1.5
Response:  If Mary needs 2 cups of flour and the recipe calls for 12 cups in total, then she has added too much flour. The correct amount of flour needed is 10 cups (12 - 2 = 10).
Response: 40 glasses of milk. Explanation: According to the question, Mary has already added three scoops of flour (which is equal to 3 x 180 = 540 grams) and 62 scoops of sugar (which is equal to 62 x 100 = 6200 grams). To find out how many glasses of milk she needs to add, we can use the formula: Number of glasses = Total weight of ingredients / Weight of one glass. Based on this calculation, Mary needs to add 40 glasses of milk (40 x 540 = 21600 grams / 1000 = 21.6 glasses).
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has added ten bowls of measuring and two bowls of sugar, which is a total of twelve bowls (ten + two = twelve). To find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add, we can convert the number of bowls to cups by dividing it by the number of cups in each bowl (which is assumed to be one cup per bowl). Therefore, Mary needs to add twenty cups of sugar (twelve / 14 = 20) to the recipe."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has put 11 cups of flour in the bowl, which is more than the required amount of 12 cups. Therefore, she will have excess flour left over and will not need any additional cups."
Response: 50 cups (or 750 grams) of flour are needed to fill up the bowl.
Response:  Yes, you can make more than seven glasses of mjøl (meal) than salt. The reason is that the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour and only 7 cups of salt, so you have an excess of flour that can be used to make additional batches of the dish.
Response: 5/2 = 2.5 glasses of sugar are needed to make up for the lack of flour.
Response: 500 grams (or 500g) of sugar are needed for the recipe, not 2 cups as stated in the question.
Response: 4 cups (or 960 grams) of flour are needed to fill up four glasses.
Response: 2 glasses of molasses are needed to fill up the difference between the required amount (9 cups) and the amount provided by Mary (6 cups). Therefore, the correct answer is 3 glasses of molasses.
"Response: 23
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has put in 11 glasses of molasses, which is half of the required amount. Therefore, she needs an additional 12 glasses (23 - 11 = 23) of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  If Mary needs 5 cups of flour to make the cake and she has added extra cups of flour, then she can add up to 3 more cups of flour without exceeding the total amount needed for the recipe. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 cups of flour (5 + 3).
"Response:  If Mary needs 12 cups of flour and she added many extra cups of flour, then she has more than enough flour to make the cake.  Therefore, the correct answer is ""more than 12 cups""."
Response: 5 glasses of water
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Mary has added 12 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour instead of the required 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. To make up for this mistake, she will need to add an additional 5 cups of sugar to the recipe."
Response: 6 glasses of water
"Response: 56
Explanation:  If Mary needs 40 cups of flour to make one cake and she has already added 4 cups, then she will need an additional 36 cups (40 - 4 = 36) of flour to complete the recipe."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the recipe, for every 9 cups of sugar, you need 7 cups of flour and 4 cups of salt. Since Mary has given you two cups of flour more than salt, you will need to add an additional cup of salt to the mixture. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 cups of salt."
Response: 500 grams (or 500 g) of sugar are needed to balance out the amount of salt used in the recipe.
"Response: 4 cups (of sugar)
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, Mary has already added four cups of sugar to her cake recipe, which means she still needs three more cups of sugar to complete the recipe."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the passage, there are 19 bird families that migrate to warmer lands during winter. If 60 birds flew away from this mountain to migrate, then more than twice as many (i.e., 23) birds flew away from the mountain to migrate compared to those who remained here."
"Response: 100
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 87 bird families in the area during winter and seven of them flew away to warmer lands. This means that 93% (87/7) of the bird families remained in the area during winter."
Response: 56 (fuglefamiliar)
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, 23 bird families flew to Africa and 37 to Asia. This means that 40 bird families (23 + 37) were sitting near their wintering grounds."
"Response: 50

Explanation:
The total number of bird families that migrate to warmer lands is 8. If 42 birds from these families migrated to Africa and 31 migrated to Asia, then many more birds from these same families must have migrated to Africa. Therefore, the answer is 50."
"Response: 106

Question:  The number of bird families in the area is 38. If 47 birds flew to Africa and 94 flew to Asia, how many birds flew to Asia?  
Formula: Number of birds that flew to Asia = Total number of birds - Number of birds that flew to Africa

Answer: 94"
"Response: 246
Explanation: If 38 birds flew to Africa and 80 birds flew to Asia, that means there are 38 + 80 = 118 birds left in the area. Since winter is almost here and most animals migrate to warmer lands, it's likely that many of these remaining birds will also migrate. Therefore, the number of birds that will fly away for winter is 118 - (number of birds that stayed behind) = 246."
"Response: 26
Explanation: If there are currently 87 bird families in the vicinity of this mountain and 18 new bird families were built, then many of the existing birds would not be able to find their way back to their old habitats. Therefore, the correct answer is 26."
"Response: 108

Explanation:
The passage states that there are 49 bird families at the mountain during winter and 24 new bird families come from the Arctic to nearby areas. This means that the total number of bird families in the area is 73 (49 + 24). Therefore, the answer is 108 (73 x 2)."
"Response: 35

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Om det i utgangspunkt var 41 fuglefamiliar som bodde ved fjellet,"" which means that initially there were 41 bird families living near the mountain. Then it says ""Kor mange var det dann?"" which translates to ""Were many of them gone?"" indicating that some of these birds had already migrated away for the winter. Finally, it asks how many bird families remained, and based on the information provided, the answer is 35."
"Response: 30

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Om det i utgangspunktet var 45 fuglefamiliar som budde på fjellet,"" which means that initially there were 45 bird families living on the mountain. Then it says ""Kor mange av dei var det som vart vekk for vinteren,"" which translates to ""Many of them were gone for winter."" This implies that some of the original 45 bird families left for warmer climates during the winter season. Finally, it asks how many bird families remained on the mountain after this migration, and the answer is 15 (45 - 30 = 15). Therefore, the correct answer is 30."
"Response: 70
Explanation: If 35 birds flew to Asia and 62 birds flew to Africa, then many more birds flew to Africa than to Asia. Therefore, the correct answer is 70 (many)."
"Response: 30

Explanation:
The passage states that ""Det fins three bird families at this mountain."" This can be translated to ""There are three bird families at this mountain."" Therefore, the answer is 30."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul has given away 563 crosses and lost 558 crosses throughout the year. This means he has 332 crosses remaining. If he had 332 crosses left when his birthday came around, then he would have received that many from his friends."
Response:  No, he did not have 492 armbands left after giving away $52 and losing $535. He actually lost more than he gave away, so he would have fewer armbands remaining.
Response:  The number of plates and gummies that Paul had at the end of the year was 154.
"Response: 240
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Paul started with 531 balls and 38 gummies. At the end of the year, he had 391 balls left, which means he lost 40 balls (531 - 391 = 140). Since he didn't lose any gummies, he must have had 38 gummies at the beginning of the year and still has them at the end of the year, so the number of gummies he had at the end of the year is also 38. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls he had at the beginning and end of the year is 40, or 240 (40 / 2 = 240)."
Response: 275 (gummi balls)

Question:  Hva er summen av 20 og 35?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 55"
Response: 29
"Response: 46

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
Paul had 108 books. He sold some books at a bookstore and gave 35 books to a friend, leaving him with 62 books.
To find out how many books he sold at the bookstore, we can use the following equation:
Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left after giving some away
In this case, the total number of books was 108, and the number of books left after giving some away was 62, so we can plug these values into the equation to get:
Number of books sold = 108 - 62 = 46
Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the bookstore."

"Response: 49

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them on a market. After selling some, he bought 38 new books, which means he now has 116 books in total (71 + 38). To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of new books he bought from his initial number of books: 116 - 38 = 78. So, Paul sold 78 books."

Explanation:
Nell has 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-year-olds. She gives some of her baseball cards to Jeff and now she has 404 of the same cards and 495 of the same cards as Jeff. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards Jeff has from the total number of cards Nell has. So, the difference is 495 - 214 = 387. Therefore, Nell has 387 more baseball cards than Jeff."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell gave 195 cards to John and then 210 cards to Jeff. Therefore, the difference between the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff (210) and the total number of cards she gave away (573) is 363. Dividing this amount by 2 gives us 181.5, which rounded up to the nearest whole number is 190. So, Nell gave Jeff 190 more cards than she gave John."

Question:  How many baseball cards does Jeff have?
Answer: 29"
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell has 376 cards left after giving some away to Jeff. If she had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-year cards initially, that means she had a total of 239 + 38 = 277 cards at first. Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards and the number of ten-year cards is 277 - (38 x 10) = 45. So, Nell has 45 more ten-year cards than baseball cards."

"Response: 50

Explanation:
To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to sell in order to have as many games as she has Nintendo games, we need to divide the number of Sony games she has (132) by the number of Nintendo games she has (46). This gives us a ratio of approximately 2.85. Since you can't sell fractions of games, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 31. Therefore, Kelly needs to sell 31 Sony games to have as many games as she has Nintendo games."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Randy used 33 blocks to build a castle and 13 blocks to build a house. Therefore, he used more blocks (33) than he did (13) to build the castle compared to the house. So, the difference between the number of blocks used to build the castle and the house is 20 (33 - 13)."
Response: 105 (Randy used 105 blocks to build his house).
Response:  Randi had 74 blocks.
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. Therefore, he used more blocks (50) to build the tower than he did to build the house (20). So, the answer is 3."
"Response: 127
Explanation:
Randy had 90 blocks left after building a house and a tower. He used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower. Therefore, he used a total of 152 blocks (89 + 63). Since he had 90 blocks left initially, he used all of them up in building his house and tower. So, the number of blocks he used to build his house is 152 / 90 = 1.7 blocks per quarter."

Explanation: According to the question, Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the tornado hit. After the tornado, there was a ""heldig"" (Norwegian for ""fortunate"") decrease in the number of trees. The question asks if more than twice as many trees were destroyed than survived. Therefore, the answer is 20."
Response: 0
Response: 4
"Response: 48

Explanation:
The question states that Haley has three apples in her garden and after one five-year-old died in a silver sky, she would have 12 trees left if she were to make 12 more of them. Therefore, if Haley were to make 12 more trees, she would have 48 trees in total (3 + 12 = 45)."
Response: 40
Response:  If an earthquake caused 12 trees to fall in a row of 30 trees at the beginning of their growth cycle, and each tree grew to be 10 meters tall, how many trees would have grown back after 5 years?
"Response: 7
Explanation: If 13 trees were knocked down in a garden after an storm that had initially 3 trees, then many more than 7 trees must have been destroyed in the storm, as only 7 are mentioned in the question."
Response:  It is difficult to say with certainty how many more trees would have survived if they had been deeper in their roots. However, it is likely that some of the trees that were closer to the surface and did not have as deep of root systems would have been more susceptible to damage from the storm surge. Therefore, I would estimate that around half of the 11 trees in the origin may have survived the storm surge.
Response: 66 / 28 = 2.35
Response: 8 x 30 = 240.
Response:  The number of sekker (baskets) of apples that can be picked in one day is not specified in the text. Therefore, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer to this question.
"Response: 49 days

Explanation:
The question is asking how many seklar (a unit of measurement) with apples will be after 49 days if they have 38 seklar per day and each seklar contains 42 apples. To find out, we need to multiply the number of seklar per day by the number of days. Therefore, the answer is 49 days."
Response:  The number of apples they would have after 8 years is 1904 (25 x 66 = 1660 + 36 x 8 = 1904).
Response: 8 x 35 = 280 apples per day.
Response:  It would take approximately 13 days to gather 80 sekker of apples if they are collected at a rate of 16 sekker per day and each sekker contains 57 apples.
Response:  If he has 35 seconds with an apple and each second contains 12 apples, then he has 420 apples (35 x 12 = 420).
Response:  If they collected 74 seconds per day and threw away 71 of them, after 51 days they would have collected approximately 3690 seconds (or about 58 minutes).
"Response: 50

Explanation:
The question is asking about the number of apples that can be picked per day if one has 76 sacks and throws away 64 of them. To find out how many apples are left, we need to subtract the number of apples thrown away from the total number of apples collected. In this case, there are 12 (76 - 64) sacks of apples left. Since each sack contains 50 apples (as mentioned in the question), the total number of apples left is 50 x 12 = 600 apples. Therefore, the answer is 50."
"Response: 26

Explanation:
The question is asking about how many seklar (a unit of measurement in Norway) of apples one will have after 26 days if they start with 28 seklar and add 52 seklar from the US every day. To calculate this, we simply need to multiply the total number of seklar by the number of days passed. In this case, that would be 28 + (52 x 26) = 1344 seklar."
Response:  Yes, after 25 days they will have produced 3079 porkers with apple sauce (82 x 61 = 4932 + 3079).
Response:  Yes, many poles with apples have after 45 days.
Response:  The number of bags (sacks) of oranges that are picked per day is 44 + 25 = 69 bags.
Response: 5 x 74 = 370
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it would take 18 seconds to peel one apple every day. To calculate how many days it would take to have enough apples to make 54 kilograms of juice, we can divide the total amount of apples by the number of apples needed each day: 54 kg / 18 sek = 3 days. Therefore, it would take approximately 3 days to have enough apples to make 54 kilograms of juice if you are peeling them at a rate of 18 seconds per apple."
Response:  They collected 56 kilograms of apples (not sekkar). So they collected approximately 0.56 metric tons of apples per day.
Response: 73 days
"Response: 630

Explanation:
The question states that if you can hack 65 seconds with an apple and 46 seconds with a mate apple per day, after six days you will have hacked a total of 630 seconds (65 + 46 +... + 65 + 46)."
Response:  The number of apples (or pears) that can be harvested in one day is not given in the passage. Therefore, we cannot determine how many sacks (or bags) with apples or pears can be filled in a day.
Response: 71 + 60 = 131 sekkar med appelsin per day.

Explanation:
If they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and made $500 per shirt, then they made a total of $23,500 from those sales ($47 x $500). If they also sold 58 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game and made $500 per shirt, then they made an additional $29,000 from those sales ($58 x $500). Therefore, in total, they made $52,500 from selling T-shirts at the two games ($23,500 + $29,000)."
"Response: 367

Explanation:
The total amount of money made by selling T-shirts and shirts is calculated as follows:

T-shirt sales: 26 x 183 = $4,738
Shirt sales: 99 x 31 = $3,099
Total sales: $4,738 + $3,099 = $7,837

Therefore, the Razorback Butikken made $7,837 in total from selling T-shirts and shirts during the game in Arkansas."
Response: 230 dollars
Response:  $34 (per shirt) - $19 (per t-shirt) = $15 difference in price between a shirt and a t-shirt.
"Response: 109 dollars
Explanation:  To calculate the cost of one T-shirt, we need to know how many T-shirts were sold during the game. According to the question, 86 dollars were earned from each T-shirt and 232 dollars were earned from each shirt. Therefore, the total revenue from T-shirts was (86 x 254) + (232 x 43) = $22,768 + $9,664 = $32,432. Since the cost of one T-shirt is $86, the profit from selling one T-shirt is ($32,432 - $86) = $32,346."
Response:  $130 x 51 = $6,490
"Response:  $217

Explanation:
The question states that the company sold 14 shirts in Arkansas and Texas Tech, and made $217 profit from each shirt sale. Therefore, the total amount of money made by the company is $217 x 14 = $2968."
"Response: 250
Explanation:
If Arkansas scored $3 in silver during the game against Texas Tech and they sold $10 t-shirts per quarter, then they would have sold approximately 250 t-shirts during the entire game."
Response:  $46.75 (215 dollars / 5 shirts)
Response:  The difference in price between the two shirts is $193 ($215 - $5). Therefore, the amount of money made by selling each shirt is $193 / 2 = $96.50 per shirt.
Response:  $392
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $210 and the cost of one Razorback shirt is $240, so the difference in price between the two types of shirts is $30 ($240 - $210). Therefore, it can be said that a T-shirt is more expensive than a Razorback shirt by $30.
Response:  The cost of one t-shirt is $25 and the cost of one uniform is $115. Therefore, it would be more expensive to buy one uniform than one t-shirt.

Explanation:
The given information is that there are 34 books and they are divided into two boxes. To find out how many books Bryan has in each box, we can divide the total number of books by 2. Therefore, Bryan has 22 books in each box."
"Response: 39
Explanation:
If Bryan has 42 books and two are left on the shelves, then he must have had at least 39 books on the shelves before he removed the two. This is because there were 40 spaces for books (42 - 2 = 40), and each space could hold one book. Therefore, Bryan had 39 books on the shelves before he removed the two."
"Response: 46

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is that Bryan has 27 books and 80 magazines left of his 23 shelves. To find out how many books he has, we need to subtract the number of magazines from the total number of books. So, the number of books Bryan has = 27 - 80 = -53. Therefore, Bryan has 46 books."
"Response: 520
Explanation:
If Bryan has 9 books and 46 magazines on one shelf, and he has ten shelves in total, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 books and 46 x 10 = 460 magazines in total. Therefore, the number of magazines he has is 460."
"Response: 23 + 61 = 84

Question:  Bryan saw at his books and magazine collection. If he has 23 books and 61 magazines left of the 29 shelves, how many books and magazines does he have in total?  
Formula: Total number of books = Number of books left x (Total number of shelves / Number of shelves left)
Total number of magazines = Number of magazines left x (Total number of shelves / Number of shelves left)
Solution:
Total number of books = 23 x (29 / 23) = 57
Total number of magazines = 61 x (29 / 23) = 70
Therefore, Bryan has 57 books and 70 magazines in total."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Bryan has seven shelves with an equal number of books on each shelf. If he has 28 books total, and there are seven shelves, then each shelf must have 4 books (28 / 7 = 4)."

"Response: 3568

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Debbie bought some bottles of water from that day they were at Selje. (So she bought some water.)
* Ho drank 109 bottles per day. (So he drank a lot of water every day.)
* If each bottle held 74 days' worth of water, then how many bottles had she bought? (So we need to find out how many bottles she had bought.)

To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the question and apply basic arithmetic operations. We know that Ho drank 109 bottles per day, so if each bottle held 74 days' worth of water, then the total number of bottles he had drunk in one day was:

109 bottles/day × 74 days = 8266 bottles/month

Since Debbie had been drinking water for 74 days, the total number of bottles she had bought was:

8266 bottles/month × 74 days = 59392 bottles

Therefore, the answer to the question is 59392 bottles."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
Debbie bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale. If she drank as many bottles per day as she had left at the end of 17 days (when the sale ended), then she drank 20 bottles per day."

"Response: 76
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 21 classrooms in the school building.
* There are 98 students at the school.
* There are 7 busses for transportation.

Now, let's calculate the number of seats available per bus:

Number of seats = Number of busses x Number of students per bus
= 7 x 98 / 7 (as there are 7 busses and 98 students)
= 70 seats per bus

Since all the busses are not full, we need to subtract the number of occupied seats from the total number of seats available:

Available seats = Total seats - Occupied seats
= 70 x 7 (as there are 7 busses) -? (we don't know the exact number of occupied seats)
= 490 seats

So, if all the busses are not full, then the number of sitting students is:

Sitting students = Available seats / Seats per bus
= 490 / 70
= 76 students

Therefore, the answer to the question is 76."
Response:  The number of students at the school is 840 (84 classes x 10 students per class).

Question:  How many students are in each class at the school?  Answer: 66
Question:  If there are six places in each bus and four buses are needed to take the trip, how many buses will be used in total?  Answer: 4 x 6 = 24"
"Response: 4
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 58 students at the school and 87 lessons. This means that each class has an average of 1.5 students (58 / 87). Since there are two sitting places in each bus, it will take 2 buses to transport all the students to school. Therefore, the answer is 4 buses."
Response:  The number of students in each class is 120, and there are 84 seats in each bus. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is: 120 x 24 = 2880. Since there are only 84 seats available in each bus, the number of students who can attend school at the same time is: 2880 - 84 = 2796.

Explanation: If 22 students do not want to ride the bus and there are 8 buses available, then 4 buses will be needed to transport the remaining 66 students."
"Response: 84
Explanation: If eight students do not want to travel with the bus and 99 students are sitting in each bus, then there will be 84 students who will travel with the bus."
Response: 4 buses.
"Response: 50
Explanation:
If there are 46 buses for 92 students and each bus is full (i.e., has 50 seats), then we can calculate the number of sitting arrangements as follows:
Number of buses = 46
Number of students = 92
Number of seats per bus = 50
Total number of sitting arrangements = Number of buses x Number of students x Number of seats per bus
= 46 x 92 x 50
= 23,100
Therefore, there will be 23,100 sitting arrangements in total if all buses are full and have 50 seats each."
Response:  If Haley gave 9 gold coins to the miller's son, and many people had how much would they have then?
"Response: 5

Explanation:
Haley has 10 kugler and they get 5 of them. Therefore, many of them will get 5 kugler each."
"Response: 47
Explanation: If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will have 9 marbles left over after giving some away to the other children. Therefore, there will be 47 marbles in total (23 + 9 = 47)."
"Response: 49
Explanation: If Haley has 26 guitars and there are 13 guitar players in each class, then there will be 13 x 13 = 169 guitars in total. Since 50 of these guitars are gongs, that means there are 169 - 50 = 119 non-gong guitars. Therefore, many people can get their share of the remaining guitars."

Response: 56 days
Response:  The book has 1058 pages.
Response: 53 pages read per day
"Response: 1776
Explanation:
The book has 555 pages with five main chapters. Since Frank spent 220 days writing the book, he wrote an average of 4.39 pages per day (555 / 220 = 4.39). Therefore, there are approximately 1776 pages left in each chapter (4.39 x 5 = 21.95)."
"Response: 27
Explanation: If Frank took 660 days to write his book and there are 15 chapters in the book, then he read approximately 44 chapters per day (660 / 15 = 44)."
"Response: 63

Explanation:
The book has 249 pages, and Frank took 3 days to read the entire book. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the number of pages by the time it took him to read them: 249 / 3 = 83 pages per day."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* Frank read through many books. (This means that Frank read multiple books.)
* Each book had 66 pages. (So each book was 66 pages long.)
* It took Frank 12 days to write the entire book. (This means that Frank wrote the book over a period of 12 days.)
* If it took 492 days to read the entire book, then Frank read many books. (This implies that Frank read more than one book.)

To calculate how many books Frank read, we can use the following formula:
Number of books = Total number of days / Number of days per book
Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:
Number of books = 492 days / 12 days per book = 41 books
Therefore, Frank read 41 books."
Response: 40 pages/day
"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank could write eight pages per day. If the book has 576 pages, it will take him 72 days (576 / 8 = 72) to write the entire book if he continues writing at the same pace every day."
Response: 27 pages read per day. Explanation: If Frank took 30 days to write a book with 41 chapters and 450 pages, he would have read approximately 27 pages per day (30 days / 450 pages = 27 pages/day).
"Response: 198

Explanation:
The book had 3 chapters and Frank spent 607 days writing it. Since each chapter has 594 pages, there are 594 x 3 = 1772 pages in total. Therefore, there are 1772 - 607 = 1165 pages left to write in the remaining chapters."
"Response: 17.3
Explanation: To calculate the number of chapters read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the time taken to write the book. Since Frank took 664 days to write the book and there are 2 chapters in the book, he read approximately 17.3 chapters per day (664 days / 2 chapters = 332 days per chapter)."

Response:  The number of groups for the bananas is 47, and the number of groups for the apples is 178. Therefore, the total number of groups is 47 + 178 = 225.
Response:  The number of groups is 48.
"Response: 45

Explanation:
If there are 18 large bananas in Philip's collection and 180 total bananas in the group, then the number of small bananas is 180 - 18 = 162."
Response:  The number of groups for the bananas is 290 / 1 = 290 groups.  For the apples, the number of groups is 87 / 93 = 9 groups.
Response:  The number of groups is 345 and each group contains 16 apples. Therefore, there are 345 x 16 = 5,440 apples in total.
Response:  If Mor had baked 38 small cakes and had 19 left over, then he had baked 38 / 19 = 2 times as many cakes as he had left over. Therefore, there were 2 x 38 = 76 guests at the party.

Response: 106 flasker (79 + 53 + 42)
Response: 79
"Response: 50
Explanation:
The text states that there were 17 flasks with one bottle of regular soda each and 9 flasks with one bottle of diet soda each. Additionally, they had 29 oranges. Therefore, the total number of flasks with soda is 17 + 9 = 26. Since each flask contains at least two bottles (one regular and one diet), the total number of bottles of soda is 26 x 2 = 52. Finally, since they had 29 oranges, we can conclude that they did not have many flasks with soda."
Response: 25 (Flasker med drikk)
Response:  Yes, they had too many bottles.  The total number of bottles they had was 182 (72 + 32 + 78), which is more than the $20 per day they were spending to buy them.
Response: 27
"Response: 30

Explanation:
The passage states that there were 30 flasks with some people having regular soda and others having diet soda. None of them had anything else with them. They went out of sauce and participated in a box. They did not have anything with them again. They went back to the sauce and participated in another box. Therefore, the number of flasks with soda is 30."
"Response: 36 flasks
Explanation:
The problem states that there are 4 flasks of diet soda and 79 flasks of regular soda. If we assume that each flask contains an equal amount of soda (which is not explicitly stated in the problem), then we can calculate the total number of flasks of regular soda as follows:

Total number of flasks = Number of flasks of regular soda + Number of flasks of diet soda
= 79 flasks + 4 flasks
= 83 flasks

Therefore, if many more flasks of regular soda were available than diet soda, the answer would be 83 flasks."

Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace after a good meal, and Rachel knew that there were 295 visitors the day before, then many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day compared to the day before.  Therefore, the answer is 22 (317 - 295).
Response: 21.89
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace before Rachel arrived and she found out that it was 666 visitors that day, then many more people visited Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
Response:  If after a good meal, they visited Buckingham Palace, there were 132 visitors to the palace that day. According to the information provided, 406 people have been in Buckingham Palace over the last 327 days, but how many visitors were there on the last day?
"Response: 3076

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* ""Etter ein god måltid gjekk dei på besøk til Buckingham Palace."" (After a good meal, they went to visit Buckingham Palace.)
* ""Der fekk Rachel vite at 45 menneske hadde kome til Buckingham Palace den dagen før."" (Rachel knew that 45 people had come to Buckingham Palace the day before.)
* ""Om 829 menneske har besøkt Buckingham Palace på 85 dagar, kor mange besøkare har det dann vore?"" (If 829 people have visited Buckingham Palace over 85 days, many visitors have it been?)

To calculate the number of visitors per day, we can use the following formula:

Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days

In this case, the total number of visitors is given as 829, and the number of days is 85. Therefore, we can calculate the number of visitors per day as follows:

Number of visitors per day = 829 / 85 = 9.81

So, approximately 9.81 visitors came to Buckingham Palace every day during the period mentioned in the question."
"Response: 57
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 71 tickets sold for a visit to Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that there were 557 visitors to the palace on the day of their visit. If there were 188 visitors per day before, then the number of days since the beginning of the season is equal to the number of visitors divided by 188. Therefore, the answer is 57 days."
"Response: 427

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* ""Etter ein god máltid gjekk dei på besøk til Buckingham Palace."" (After a good meal, they went to visit Buckingham Palace.)
* ""Det var 39 bilete i Buckingham Palace."" (There were 39 tickets sold for Buckingham Palace.)
* ""Der fekk Rachel vite at det var 661 vitjande på Buckingham Palace den dagen."" (Rachel knew that there were 661 people at Buckingham Palace that day.)
* ""Viss det var 600 besøkande ein dag før, kor mange fleire besøkande kom til Buckingham Palace den dagen i staden for dagen før?"" (If there were 600 visitors the day before, how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day?)

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day of the royal reception compared to the day before. We can do this by subtracting the number of tickets sold the day before from the total number of visitors on the day of the royal reception.

Using the information provided in the question, we get:

Total number of visitors = 661 + 39 = 700
Number of visitors the day before = 600
Difference between days = Total number of visitors - Number of visitors the day before = 700 - 600 = 100

So, there were 100 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day of the royal reception compared to the day before."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, there were 419 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day before and 103 days before that. Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace was: 419 + 103 = 522 visitors.
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question was 512. According to the information provided earlier in the conversation, there were 471 visitors the day before and 808 visitors the day before that, so the total number of visitors over 89 days was 1,791.
"Response: 3680

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* There were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day of their visit.
* The previous day (day before), there were 191 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* The day before that (2 days before), there were 457 visitors to Buckingham Palace.

Using these numbers, we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over a period of 245 days using the formula:

Total Number of Visitors = Day's Visitors x Number of Days

For example, if there were 191 visitors on one day, and there are 245 days in the period, then the total number of visitors would be:

Total Number of Visitors = 191 x 245 = 45,655

Similarly, if there were 457 visitors on another day, and there are 245 days in the period, then the total number of visitors would be:

Total Number of Visitors = 457 x 245 = 113,675

By adding up the total number of visitors for each day, we get the overall total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the given period:

Total Number of Visitors = 113,675 + 45,655 + 191 = 3680

Therefore, the answer to the question is 3680."

"Response: 125 kg (or 125,000 grams)

Explanation:
The question states that 94 of the participants in the survey said they had 90 tons of grapes per day. To convert this amount to kilograms, we can use the conversion factor of 1 ton = 1000 kg. Therefore, 90 tons x 1000 kg/ton = 90,000 kg of grapes per day. Since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, we can convert this amount to grams by dividing it by 1000: 90,000 kg / 1000 = 90,000,000 grams or 125 kg."
Response:  If 266 people were able to fill 90 baskets with grapes in 5 days, then each person would have been able to fill approximately 18.3 baskets (or 90 / 5) with grapes per day.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, it takes approximately 146 days to fill many baskets with grapes if each basket can hold 244 bunches of grapes per day and there are 47 bunches of halls per day.

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 4 x 10 = 40 liters"
Response: 42
Response:  Yes, many saltwater fish can be kept in a small aquarium. The number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium depends on several factors such as water quality, tank size, and species compatibility. However, it is generally recommended to keep no more than 1-2 inches of fish per gallon of water in a small aquarium (less than 30 gallons) to ensure good water quality and prevent overcrowding. Therefore, if we assume that the aquarium has a volume of 46 gallons, then the maximum number of fish that can be kept in it would be around 23-46 fish, depending on their size.
"Response: 378
Explanation:
Han had 15 arms for saltwater animals and 62 arms for freshwater animals. If he has 19 fish in his aquarium, that means he has a total of 15 + 62 = 77 animals. Therefore, he has many animals in all."

"Response: 16
Explanation: If there are 20 houses in a quarter and the mail carrier must deliver 32 trash bags to each of the four quarters, then the total number of trash bags that need to be delivered is 4 x 32 = 128. Since there are only 20 houses in a quarter, it means that each house will receive 6 trash bags (128 / 20). Therefore, the correct answer is 16."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
If there are 19 houses in one quarter of the area (78 quarters), then there will be 19 x 4 = 76 houses in each quarter. Since the postman has to deliver 30 trash bags to each quarter, he will have to deliver a total of 76 x 30 = 2280 trash bags. Therefore, the correct answer is 2280."
"Response: 140 houses
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the postman delivers 8 circular posts to each of the 55 quarter areas. Therefore, the total number of circular posts delivered is 8 x 55 = 440. Since each circular post contains 32 postcards, the total number of postcards delivered is 440 x 32 = 14,640. Finally, since there are many households in each quarter area (as stated in the question), the total number of households that receive postcards is 14,640 / 14 = 1050 households per quarter area. Therefore, the total number of households that receive postcards in all 55 quarter areas is 1050 x 55 = 57,500 households."

"Response: 376,667
Explanation:
The number of children (born) in Lawrence County is given as 828521. If 8000 of these children go to summer camp and 59 young people are attending, then the number of children left behind is:
828521 - 8000 = 748521
Since there are 40 million villagers in the area, the number of children who were at home can be calculated as follows:
Number of children at home = Total number of children x Percentage of children not going to summer camp
= 748521 x (1 - 0.013)
= 748521 x 0.987
= 726757
Therefore, approximately 376,667 children were left behind at home during the summer vacation."

Explanation:
The given information is as follows:
There were 93 organisms in an aquarium, and 97 alligators in another tank. If there were 40 alligators in the other tank, then how many other alligators were there?
To find out, we need to subtract the number of alligators in the first tank from the total number of organisms in both tanks. Therefore, if there were 93 organisms in the first tank and 97 alligators in the second tank, and 40 of those alligators were in the second tank, then there were 57 other alligators (93 - 40 = 57) in the second tank."
