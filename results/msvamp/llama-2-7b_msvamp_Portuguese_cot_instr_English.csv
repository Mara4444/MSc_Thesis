Response:  On Monday (second day), she played with 18 kids at home. In Tuesday (third day), she played soccer with 10 kids. So, in total, she played with 18 + 10 = 28 kids. Therefore, she played with more kids on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (second day), Julia played with 11 kids. On Tuesday (third day), she played with 12 kids. So, we can say that Julia played with more kids on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of kids she played with on Tuesday and Monday is 12 - 11 = 1.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with five kids at home on Monday and then played with more kids on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of $X$ kids on both days combined. Since we know that $X = 15$, we can conclude that Julia played with $5 + X = 15$ kids in total. Therefore, the answer is $5 + 15 = 20$.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with kids at home on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, she played with 14 kids, so she played with a total of 16 kids (including herself). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Julia played soccer with 16 children at home on Monday and then added another 12 children to play on Tuesday, she would have played with a total of 16 + 12 = 28 children in all. So, she played with 28 children on Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children at home on Tuesday and she also played with 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday, then we can conclude that Julia played with 22 children in total (14 + 8). Therefore, Julia played with 22 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (segunda-feira), Julia played with 17 kids. On Tuesday (terça-feira), she played with 15 kids. And on Wednesday (quarta-feira), she played with 2 kids. So, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 kids.
Response:  In the second day, Julia played with 15 children. So in the third day (terça), she played with 18 - 15 = 3 more children than the previous day. Therefore, Julia played with 3 + 15 = 18 children on the third day.
Response:  On Monday (segunda-feira), Julia played with 5 children. So, she played with 5 + 9 = 14 children in total during the week. Therefore, she played with 5 children on Monday and 14 children on Thursday (quarta-feira).
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 2 kids at home on Monday (second day), 14 kids on Tuesday (third day), and 16 kids on Wednesday (fourth day). So, she played with 14 + 16 = 30 kids in total on Tuesday and Wednesday.
"Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 9 children at home in the second day, 7 children in the third day and 96 children in the fourth day. So, we need to find out how many more children she played with in the second day than in the third day. To do this, we can subtract the number of children she played with in the third day from the number of children she played with in the second day:

Number of children Julia played with in the second day - Number of children Julia played with in the third day = 9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children in the second day than in the third day."
Response:  On Monday (segunda), Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday (terça), she played with two children. And on Wednesday (quarta), she played with eight children. So, in total, Julia played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday. The difference between these numbers is: 14 - 8 = 6. Therefore, Julia played with six more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played soccer with 8 kids on Tuesday, 11 kids on Wednesday, and 9 kids on Thursday. So, she played soccer with a total of 28 kids (8 + 11 + 9). Now, we need to find out how many more kids she played with on Wednesday than on Thursday. To do this, we can subtract the number of kids she played with on Thursday from the number of kids she played with on Wednesday: 11 - 9 = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 more kids on Wednesday than on Thursday.
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 15 children at home on the second day and 18 children on the third day. On the fourth day, she played with only 7 children. So, we can say that the number of children Julia played with on the second and third days is greater than the number of children she played with on the fourth day. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on the second and third days and the number of children she played with on the fourth day is equal to 15 - 7 = 8.
"Response: 
On Monday (segunda), she played with 13 kids at home.
On Tuesday (terça), she played with 10 kids at home.
On Wednesday (quarta), she played cards with 15 kids.
So, in total, she played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 kids."
"Response: 
On Monday (quarta), she played cards with 20 kids. So, in total, she played cards with 20 + 7 + 13 = 40 kids."
"Response: 
On Monday, Julia played with 12 kids at home. On Tuesday, she played tag with 14 kids. So, in total, she spent 34 hours playing with kids.
Now, let's calculate how many kids Julia played with in total:
12 + 14 = 26
So, Julia played with 26 kids in total."
"Response: 
On Monday (2nd day), she played with 19 kids for x hours.
On Tuesday (3rd day), she played with 18 kids for y hours.
Total time spent playing tag = x + y
Given that she spent a total of 38 hours playing tag in both days, we can set up the equation:
x + y = 38...(1)
Now, let's solve for y:
y = 38 - x...(2)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1):
x + (38 - x) = 38
Simplifying:
2x = 38
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 19
So, she played with 19 kids for x = 19 hours on Monday and 18 kids for y = 37 hours on Tuesday."
"Response:  On Monday (second day), she played with 6 children. On Tuesday (third day), she played with 5 children at home. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Tuesday is:
$$ \boxed{6 - 5 = 1} $$
Therefore, she played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 18 kids in total. She played with 4 kids on Monday and still played with more kids on Tuesday. So, she played with x kids on Tuesday. Since Julia played with 4 kids on Monday, we can write an equation: 18 - 4 = x. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, Julia played with 14 kids on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Monday (quarta), Julia played with 4 children. On Tuesday (terça), she played with 17 children. And on Sunday (segunda), she played with 6 children. So, we can write an equation:

Julia played with x + 4 children on Monday.
She played with 6 + x children on Tuesday.
We know that x is equal to 17 - 4 = 13. Therefore, Julia played with 13 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
Response:  If he started with 10 cookies and then had 25 more, that means he has a total of 35 cookies now. So, if he had 43 cookies in the end, that means he must have started with 35 - 10 = 25 cookies initially.
Response:  If he came 28 candies first and then ate more 42, so in total he ate 28 + 42 = 70 candies. And if he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate, then the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 70 + 63 = 133. So, Bobby ate 133 doces.
Response:  The first three sentences of the question tell us that Bobby came 33 doces and then he ate more four. So, in total, Bobby ate 37 doces (33 + 4). Now, we are told that he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final answer is: Bobby came 37 doces and 14 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  The total number of sweets that Bobby consumed is equal to 38 + 36 = 74. Since he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate, we need to subtract this amount from the total number of sweets he ate. So, the number of more sweets than chocolate that Bobby ate is:
74 - 16 = 58
Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more sweets than chocolate."
Response:  At first, Bobby had 20 doces and he ate 34 of them. So, now he has 20 - 34 = -14 doces (negative because we subtracted). Then, he ate more 18 doces, so now he has -14 + 18 = 3 doces. Therefore, Bobby ate 3 doces in total.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 21 doces and he ate 5 of them. So, now he has 21 - 5 = 16 doces left. Then, he ate more 9 doces. Now, he has 16 + 9 = 25 doces left.
Response:  If Bobby had 22 doces and he ate some of them, then he has less than 22 doces now. So, if he ate 5 more doces after that, then he has even fewer doces left. Therefore, if he still has 8 doces left, it means that he ate 14 doces initially (22 - 14 = 8).
Response:  If Bobby had 19 doces and he ate two, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 doces left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 doces and he ate some of them, then he has less doces now. So, if he has 20 doces left, that means he ate 12 doces (32 - 20 = 12).
Response:  If he had initially 36 donuts and then ate 17 more, he would have 36 + 17 = 53 donuts in total. Then, if he ate another 15 donuts, he would be left with 53 - 15 = 38 donuts. So, there are 38 donuts left for him.
Response:  If he had 23 doces and now has 30 doces, then he gained 7 doces (30 - 23 = 7). So, he still has 7 doces left.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park, then we know that Allan has 5 - 3 = 2 more balloons than Jake in the park. So, Allan had 2 more balloons than Jake in the park.
Response:  The Allan brought two balloons to the park and the Jake brought three balloons to the park. So, in total, there are five balloons at the park (2 + 3). Now we need to find out how many more balloons the Jake had than the Allan. To do this, we can subtract the number of balloons the Allan brought from the number of balloons the Jake brought: 5 (Jake) - 2 (Allen) = 3. Therefore, the Jake had three more balloons than the Allan at the park.
Response:  If Alan brought two balloons to the park and Jake brought three balloons, then together they have five balloons at the park (2 + 3 = 5). So, Jake brought 3 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and he brought more than Allan did, then Allan must have brought x balloons to the park. Since Jake brought 6 + 4 = 10 balloons in total, we can set up the equation: 6 + 4 = 10... (1) Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem into this equation: x + 4 = 10... (2) Solving for x, we get: x = 6 So, Allan brought 6 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than that number of balloons, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park. Therefore, Jake brought 11 balloons to the park.
"Response: 
Allen brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park. So together they had 3 + 5 = 8 balloons at the park.
Then Allen bought two more balloons in the park. So now he has 8 + 2 = 10 balloons.
Jake did not buy any new balloons, so he still has 5 balloons.
Therefore, the total number of balloons that Allen and Jake have in the park is 10 (Allen) + 5 (Jake) = 15 balloons."
"Response:  The information given in the question is as follows:
O Allan trouxe dois balões e o Jake trouxe quatro balões para o parque. (2 + 4 = 6)
O Allan comprou mais 3 balões no parque. (6 + 3 = 9)
So, the number of balloons that Allan had at the park was 9, which is more than the number of balloons that Jake had, which is 6. Therefore, the correct answer is A - More than 6."
"Response:  The information given in the question is as follows:
O Allan trouxe 2 balões (initially) + 3 more balloons he bought at the park = 5 balloons brought by Allan to the park.
Jake brought 6 balloons initially. So, the difference between the number of balloons brought by Jake and Allan is:
6 - 5 = 1
So, Jake had one more balloon than Allan at the park."
Response:  The total number of balloons brought to the park by both Allan and Jake is equal to 5 + 4 = 9. Then, Allan bought additional 3 balloons at the park, so in total, he brought 9 + 3 = 12 balloons to the park.
Response:  The Allan brought 6 balloons and the Jake brought 2 balloons to the park. So, in total, they had 8 balloons (6 + 2). Then, the Jake bought more 3 balloons at the park, so now he has 5 balloons (2 + 3). Now we need to find out how many balloons Allan had more than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons that Jake bought from the number of balloons that Allan brought: 6 - 3 = 3. Therefore, Allan had 3 more balloons than Jake at the park.
Response:  The Allan brought 6 balloons to the park and the Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. So far, they have 9 balloons (6 + 3) in total. Then, the Jake bought more four balloons at the park, so he has 12 balloons now (9 + 4). Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons that the Jake had compared to the Allan is 12 - 9 = 3.
Response:  The total number of balloons brought by both is 5 + 6 = 11. Then, Jake bought more balloons and added them to his collection in the park, which means he had 11 + 3 = 14 balloons in total. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Allen brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park while Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls to the park. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 3 + 20 = 23 (balloons) and 5 + 59 = 64 (balls). Therefore, Allen had 23 balloons and Jake had 64 balls at the park.
Response:  According to the question, Allen brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park while Jake brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park. So in total, Allen had 7 + 5 = 12 items at the park, and Jake had 6 + 4 = 10 items at the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Allen and Jake had at the park is 10 (Jake) + 12 (Allen) = 22.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and he and Jake together brought 6 balloons, then Jake must have brought 1 balloon to the park. So, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more, he had a total of five balloons in the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, if Jake also brought six balloons to the same park, then Jake had six balloons there as well (6 = 6). So, the difference between how many balloons Jake had compared to Allan is equal to the number of balloons that Allan initially brought minus the number of balloons that Jake brought (5 - 6 = -1). Therefore, Jake had one fewer balloon than Allan at the park.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 2 hours learning Chinese every day. So he learns English for 6/14 = 0.43 hours per day and Chinese for 2/14 = 0.14 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours learning English and 7 hours learning Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning English from the number of hours he spends learning Chinese. So, if we subtract 6 from 7, we get -1. Therefore, Ryan spends -1 hour more learning Chinese than English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day and also spends some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours studying languages each day. So, he spends x hours learning Chinese. Since we know that Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day, we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 4. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 4 - 3. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese every day.
"Response:  According to the problem, Ryan spends 7 hours learning English and some additional time learning Chinese. If he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, then the number of hours he spends learning Chinese is:

7 - 2 = 5

So, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese."
Response:  According to the problem, Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese every day and some additional time learning English. If he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, then he spends x hours learning English. Since he spends 5 hours learning Chinese, we can write an equation as follows: 5 = x + 2. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: x + 2 = 5. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us x = 3. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours learning English each day.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of:

6 x 5 = 30 hours learning English in 5 days
7 x 5 = 35 hours learning Chinese in 5 days

Therefore, Ryan will have spent a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours learning both English and Chinese over the course of 5 days."
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day and 5 hours learning Chinese every day, then he will spend a total of 6 x 2 = 12 hours learning English in 2 days. So, the answer is 12 hours.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:

5 x 6 = 30 hours learning English
4 x 6 = 24 hours learning Chinese

Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 54 hours (30 + 24) learning both languages."
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) per day studying languages. Since he studies for 86 days, he will have spent a total of 860 hours (10 hours/day x 86 days) studying languages altogether. So, to find out how many hours he spends on each language per day, we can divide the total number of hours he studied by the number of days he studied: 860 hours / 86 days = 10 hours/day (English) and 10 hours/day (Chinese).
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours learning English every day. So, he learns English for x number of days in a week. Then, he spends 7 hours learning Chinese and 3 hours learning Spanish. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 6 = 7 + 3
Solving this equation, we get:
x = 5 (days)
So, Ryan spends 5 days learning English, 7 days learning Chinese, and 3 days learning Spanish."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week and Chinese for 3 x 24 = 72 hours per week. Since he also spends 58 hours per week learning Spanish, we can calculate how many more hours he spends learning English than learning Chinese as follows:

Hours spent learning English - Hours spent learning Chinese = 144 - 72 = 72 hours

Therefore, Ryan spends 72 hours more per week learning English than he does learning Chinese."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 7 + 7 = 14 hours per day. He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish, which means he learns Spanish for 4 + 4 = 8 hours per day. So, Ryan spends more time learning English than he does learning Spanish. The difference between these two amounts is 14 - 8 = 6 hours.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 2 hours learning English every day and 5 hours learning Chinese. He also spends 4 hours learning Spanish. So, in total, he spends 7 hours (2 + 5) learning languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many hours more he spends learning Chinese than Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the time spent learning Spanish from the time spent learning Chinese: 7 hours - 4 hours = 3 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours more learning Chinese than Spanish.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English every day, then he learns English for x hours per day. Since he also learns Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 2x = 3 (where x is the number of hours Ryan learns English)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1.5 (hours/day)
Therefore, Ryan spends 1.5 hours learning Chinese every day."
"Response:  On day 1, Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese, for a total of 9 hours (4 + 5 = 9). On each subsequent day, he spends an additional 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese, so his daily totals are: Day 2 - 9 + 9 = 18 hours; Day 3 - 18 + 9 = 27 hours; Day 4 - 27 + 9 = 36 hours; Day 5 - 36 + 9 = 45 hours; Day 6 - 45 + 9 = 54 hours; Day 7 - 54 + 9 = 63 hours. Therefore, in total, Ryan spends 63 hours learning English and 63 hours learning Chinese over the course of 7 days."
Response:  On Monday (second day), Tiffany found 7 more bags of cans than she had on Sunday (first day). So, if she had 8 bags on Sunday, then she must have had 15 bags in total (8 + 7 = 15) on both days combined.
Response:  On Monday (second day), Tiffany found 12 more bags of cans than she had on Sunday (first day). So, if she had 7 bags on Sunday and found 12 more on Monday, then she has 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans in total now.
Response:  On Monday (second day), Tiffany found more empty cans, so she had additional 4 + x = 6 sacos (where x is the number of extra cans she found). Since she already had 4 sacos on Monday, in total she has 4 + 4 + x = 10 sacos of empty cans to recycle.
Response:  On Monday (second day), she found additional 4 bags of cans. So, in total, she had 2 + 4 = 6 bags of cans. Therefore, she had 6 bags of cans on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (the first day), Tiffany had 10 bags of cans. Then, she found 3 more bags of cans on Tuesday, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans in total. Finally, on Wednesday, she found 7 more bags of cans, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday (second day), Tiffany found 10 more bags of cans, so she had 18 bags in total (8 + 10). Then, on the third day, she found 4 more bags of cans, so she had 22 bags in total (18 + 4). Therefore, after Monday, Tiffany had found a total of 22 bags of cans.
Response:  On Monday (second day), she found additional 7 bags of cans and 44 bags of bottles. So, in total, she had 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans and 44 + 44 = 88 bags of bottles. Therefore, Tiffany had a total of 10 + 88 = 98 bags of trash to recycle.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red peppers and 16 green peppers in the basket. To find out how many more red peppers there are than green peppers, we can subtract the number of green peppers from the total number of peppers:

17 - 16 = 1
So, there is one more red pepper than green pepper in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peppers and 11 green peppers in the basket. So, if we subtract the number of red peppers from the total number of peppers, we will get the number of green peppers left in the basket. Therefore, the number of green peppers left in the basket is 11 - 5 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red peppers and some green peppers in the basket. If we assume that the number of green peppers is x, then the total number of peppers in the basket is 10 + x. Since there are 15 peppers in the basket, we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, there are 5 green peppers in the basket.
Response:  If there are three red peppers and more green ones in the basket, then there must be some number of green peppers in the basket that is greater than 3 (the number of red peppers). So, if there are 10 more green peppers than red peppers in the basket, then there must be 7 green peppers in the basket (since 10 is greater than 3). Therefore, there are 7 green peppers in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red peppers, which means we have 7 x 3 = 21 units of peppers in total. Then, we have 15 yellow peppers, which means we have 15 x 4 = 60 units of peppers in total. Finally, we have 8 green peppers, which means we have 8 x 5 = 40 units of peppers in total. Therefore, there are 21 + 60 + 40 = 121 units of peppers in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red peppers in total (red peppers = 7). And we also know that there are 3 more yellow peppers than green peppers (yellow peppers = 71 - 8 = 63). So, if we add up all the numbers of peppers in the basket, we get: Red peppers + Yellow peppers = 7 + 63 = 70. Therefore, there are 70 peppers in total, including both red and green ones.
Response:  We have 2 red peppers, which means we have 2 x 6 = 12 yellow peppers and 14 green peppers. So, there are more green peppers than yellow peppers in the basket. The correct answer is 14 - 6 = 8 green peppers more than yellow peppers in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red peppers in total and 11 yellow ones. So, we can write this as an equation:

Red peppers = 19
Yellow peppers = 11
Now, let's find out how many more red peppers than yellow peppers there are:
More red peppers = Red peppers - Yellow peppers
= 19 - 11
= 8
So, there are 8 more red peppers than yellow peppers in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red peppers and 90 yellow peppers in the basket. Since each red pepper has 3 segments, we can say that there are 6 x 3 = 18 red segments in the basket. Similarly, since each yellow pepper has 4 segments, we can say that there are 90 x 4 = 360 yellow segments in the basket. Therefore, the total number of segments in the basket is 18 + 360 = 378 segments. Now, we need to find out how many of these segments are green. According to the question, there are 16 green peppers in the basket. So, the number of green segments is 16. Thus, the number of red and green peppers in the basket is 18 + 16 = 34.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red peppers in total and 14 yellow peppers in total. So, if we divide the number of red peppers by the total number of peppers (18/32), we get 0.56. Similarly, if we divide the number of yellow peppers by the total number of peppers (14/32), we get 0.44. Therefore, there are approximately 56% red peppers and 44% yellow peppers in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peppers in the basket, and each red pepper has 14 yellow peppers. So, if we multiply 5 by 14, we get 70 yellow peppers. Now, let's subtract the number of green peppers from the total number of peppers to find out how many green peppers are in the basket. If there are 6 green peppers, then we can deduce that there are 63 yellow peppers (70 - 6) and 5 red peppers in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 63 yellow peppers and 5 red peppers.
"Response:  We know that there are 65 cests and each cesto has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. So, in total we have:
7 x 65 = 455 red peaches
3 x 65 = 195 green peaches
In conclusion, there are 455 + 195 = 650 peaches in all the cests."
Response:  We have 11 baskets of strawberries. Each basket has 10 red strawberries and 18 green strawberries. So, in total, we have 10 + 18 = 28 strawberries.
Response:  We have 6 cests of strawberries and each cesta has 16 red strawberries and 18 green ones. So, we can write an equation as follows: Red strawberries = 6 x 16 = 96 Green strawberries = 6 x 18 = 108 Total number of strawberries = Red + Green = 96 + 108 = 204 Now we know that there are 204 strawberries in total, among which 96 are red and 108 are green.
Response:  We have 7 baskets of strawberries. Each basket has 10 red strawberries and 2 green ones. So, in total, we have 7 x 10 = 70 red strawberries and 2 green strawberries. Therefore, there are 70 + 2 = 72 strawberries in total.
"Response:  If there are 7 pumpkins in all the baskets, and each basket has 4 red pumpkins and 3 green pumpkins, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of red pumpkins. There are 4 red pumpkins in each basket, so the total number of red pumpkins is 4 x 5 = 20.

Step 2: Calculate the number of green pumpkins. There are 3 green pumpkins in each basket, so the total number of green pumpkins is 3 x 5 = 15.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pumpkins. The total number of pumpkins is the sum of the red and green pumpkins: 20 + 15 = 35.

So, there are 35 baskets of pumpkins."
"Response:  If there are two baskets of strawberries and each basket has 4 red strawberries and some green ones, then...

Step-by-step solution:
Let x be the number of green strawberries in one basket. Since there are two baskets, together they have 2x green strawberries.
The total number of strawberries in both baskets is 4 + 2x = 6x.
Since there are 12 strawberries in total, we can set up the equation: 6x = 12.
Solving for x, we get: x = 2.
So, there are 2 green strawberries in each basket."
Response:  If there are 16 pumpkins in the basket and 13 of them are red, then there are 3 pumpkins that are not red (since 16 - 13 = 3). So, among these 3 non-red pumpkins, some may be green. Therefore, the number of green pumpkins in the basket is 3.
Response:  If each basket has 19 red peppers and 4 green peppers, then the total number of red peppers is 19 x 15 = 285. The total number of green peppers is 4 x 15 = 60. Therefore, there are 285 + 60 = 345 peppers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 10 pêssegos in total and they are distributed equally among some number of baskets. So, each basket has an equal number of red and green pêssegos. Since there are 4 red pêssegos per basket, there must be 2 baskets with only red pêssegos (since 4 x 2 = 8). Therefore, there are 3 baskets with both red and green pêssegos ( since 6 x 3 = 18). So, there are 3 baskets in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green peppers and 2 red peppers in the basket. So, if we divide the total number of peppers (6 + 2 = 8) by the number of red peppers (2), we get the ratio of green to red peppers: 6/2 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 more green peppers than red peppers in the basket.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 4 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added more action figures to the shelf, making the total number of figures 8. So, we can conclude that Jerry added 4 + x figures to the original 4, where x is the number of additional action figures he added. Therefore, the answer is 8 - 4 = 4.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures in a shelf in his room. Later, he added more 7 action figures to the same shelf. So, initially Jerry had x action figures in the shelf. Now, there are 10 action figures in the shelf altogether, including both the initial ones and the new ones. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, Jerry initially had 3 action figures in the shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 4 dolls and 22 books in his room initially. Later, he added more action figures to the shelf. So, we can say that there were x action figures on the shelf after Jerry made the addition. Since we are asked how many action figures Jerry had in total, including both the initial ones and those he added later, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 22 + 6. Solving for x, we get x = 18. Therefore, Jerry had 18 action figures on the shelf after adding more toys.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room. Later, he added more 7 action figures to the shelf. So, initially there were 5 + 9 = 14 items in total. After adding more action figures, the total number of items became 14 + 7 = 21. Therefore, there were 21 action figures and 9 books in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had two action figures and ten books in his room. Later, he added four more action figures to the shelf. So, how many books did Jerry have initially? We know that after adding four new action figures, there were now five action figures in total. Therefore, if we subtract the number of new action figures (four) from the original number of books (ten), we get six books left over. So, the final answer is six books plus the initial number of action figures, which is two. Thus, Jerry had eight books and five action figures in his room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 figures of action and 9 books in the shelf. Later, he added more 10 books to the shelf. So, the total number of books Jerry had in the shelf is: 8 + 9 = 17 books.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had seven action figures and two books in his closet. Later, he added four more books to the shelf. So, how many action figures and books did Jerry have in total?

Action Figures: 7 + 2 = 9
Books: 2 + 4 = 6
Therefore, Jerry had 9 action figures and 6 books in his closet."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his room. Later, he added more 9 books to the shelf. So, there were total 17 items (5 action figures + 2 books + 9 books) in Jerry's room.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, how many action figures did Jerry have in total after these changes? We can use the information given in the question to find out.

Jerry had 8 action figures at first, plus 4 new ones he added later, for a total of 12 action figures. Then, he removed 5 old ones, leaving him with 7 action figures in his room. Therefore, the final number of action figures Jerry had was 7."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures in his room. Later, he added more 4 action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones. So, if there are now 6 action figures on the shelf, then Jerry must have taken 3 - 4 = 1 figure from the shelf. Therefore, Jerry took 1 action figure off the shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 action figures in his room initially. Later, he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. So, if there are now 8 action figures on the shelf, we can deduce that Jerry must have added 3 new action figures to the shelf (since 8 - 7 = 1, and 1 + 3 = 4). Therefore, Jerry added 3 new action figures to the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures in a shelf in his room. Later, he added more 2 action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures in the shelf now, how many did Jerry have initially in the shelf? We can deduce that Jerry had 3 action figures initially in the shelf (initially = at first).
Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 action figures in a shelf at first and then added more 7 action figures to it later. So, the total number of action figures he has is 9 + 7 = 16. Now, we are also told that there were 10 books on the same shelf as the action figures. Therefore, the difference between the number of action figures and the number of books is 16 - 10 = 6.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room. Later, he added more 2 action figures to the shelf. So, there were how many action figures after that addition? Answer: Total number of action figures = Initial number of action figures + Number of new action figures added = 4 + 2 = 6 action figures. Therefore, there were 6 action figures besides the 3 books in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. Later, he added more 2 action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of items Jerry had was 7 + 3 = 10. Therefore, there were 10 things (books plus action figures) in Jerry's room.
Response:  We have two birds already sitting in the fence. If more birds come and join them, then there will be a total of 6 birds in the fence now. So, if we add the number of new birds that came to sit in the fence (which is not specified in the question), it means that the total number of birds in the fence is 6 + x, where x is the number of new birds that came to sit in the fence. Therefore, the answer is 6 + x.
Response:  At first, there were 4 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So, now there are a total of 8 birds (4 + 4) sitting on the fence. Therefore, initially, there were 4 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 46 cegonhas and 4 pássaros already sitting in the fence. Then, we are told that 6 more pássaros came to join them. So, now there are 4 + 6 = 10 pássaros sitting in the fence. Therefore, the answer is 10 pássaros.
Response:  We have three birds and two hawks already sitting on the fence. Then five more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. But we were told that there are also two hawks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final number of creatures sitting on the fence is 8 (birds) + 2 (hawks) = 10.
Response:  We have three birds and four crows already sitting in the fence. Then two more birds come to join them, so we now have five birds (including the original three) and still four crows. Therefore, there are more birds than crows sitting in the fence. The correct answer is 5 - 4 = 1 more bird than crow.
Response:  We have two birds and six crows initially. Then three more birds come to join them, so we now have five birds in total (2 + 3 = 5). However, there are still six crows sitting on the fence, so the number of crows remains unchanged at six. Therefore, the final count is five birds and six crows sitting on the fence together.
Response:  We have four birds and six sparrows initially. Then two more sparrows join them, making it eight in total. So, we have four + eight = twelve birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and four crows already sitting in the fence. Then six more crows join them, making it seven crows in total. So, we now have three birds and seven crows sitting in the fence. Therefore, there are 3 + 7 = 10 creatures sitting in the fence.
Response:  We have six birds and three crows already sitting on the fence. Then two more crows join them, making it seven crows in total. So, we now have six birds and seven crows sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more birds than crows sitting on the fence. The correct answer is: Six birds and seven crows are sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds and three crows already sitting in the fence. If six more crows join them, then we will have... (4 + 6) = 10 crows sitting in the fence! So, there are ten crows more than birds sitting in the fence.
Response:  We have six birds already sitting on the fence. Then four more birds come and join them, making it ten birds in total. Next, eight crows come and join the group, bringing the total number of birds to eighteen (6 + 4 + 8 = 18). So, there are eighteen birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds (pássaros) already sitting on the fence. Then five more birds and four more hawks come to join them. So, in total, we have seven birds (pássaros) and three hawks (cegonhas) sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are seven more pássaros than cegonhas sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, two more birds join them, making it five birds in total. Next, six crows come and join the group, bringing the total number of birds to eleven (3 + 5 = 11). So, there are eleven birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have five sparrows and three birds sitting on the fence initially. Then four more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 5 + 4 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Since there are already three birds sitting on the fence, that means there are six birds in total (including the original three) sitting on the fence after the additional four birds arrive.
Response:  We have 6 crows and 2 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. But we still have 6 crows! Therefore, there are 6 crows more than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds sitting at the fence initially. Then six crows and two more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting at the fence. Therefore, there are more crows than birds sitting at the fence.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.
"Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:

80 - 37 = 43

So, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter."
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 60 Number of pages in Chapter 2 = x Where x is the number of pages in Chapter 2 We know that the total number of pages in the book is 93, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 60 + x = 93 Now let's solve for x : x = 33 So, there are 33 pages in Chapter 2.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Chapter 1 has 67 pages, so if we substitute this value into the equation above, we get: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - x Where x is the total number of pages in the book. Now we know that the total number of pages in the book is given as 67 + 36 = 103 pages. Substituting this value back into our equation, we get: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 103 - 36 = 67 pages So, the first chapter has 67 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 66 pages, so it contributes 66/3 = 22 pages to the total number of pages. Similarly, the second chapter contributes 35/3 = 11 pages, and the third chapter contributes 24/3 = 8 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 22 + 11 + 8 = 41 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and the second chapter has 18 pages less than that is 35 - 18 = 17 pages. So, the second chapter has 17 pages more than the third chapter, which has 3 pages. Therefore, the answer is 17.
"Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, we can write:

First chapter pages = 53
Third chapter pages = 21

Now, let's subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:

Number of pages difference = First chapter pages - Third chapter pages
= 53 - 21
= 32

Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter."
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1891 pages.
Response:  Since there are 2 chapters in total and each chapter has 23 pages, we can say that the first chapter has x pages, where x is equal to half of 23, which is 11.5 pages. So, the first chapter has 11 pages and ½ = 11 pages.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has x pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is 2x. Since the second chapter has 68 pages, we can write: 2x = 68. Solving for x, we get: x = 34. Therefore, the second chapter has 34 pages.
"Response:  We know that 39 campers went fishing in the afternoon and 62 campers went fishing in the morning. So, we can write this as an equation:
Morning = 62 - 39 = 23
Now let's solve for ""More"" (the difference between the number of campers who went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon):
More = 23 - 39 = -16
So there were 16 more campers who went fishing in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that 52 campers left in the morning and 61 campers left in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation:

Morning = 52
Afternoon = 61 - 52 = 9

So, there were 9 more campers who left in the afternoon than in the morning."
"Response:  If 15 campers went fishing in the morning and more arrived in the afternoon, then the total number of campers who went fishing that day is:

Morning + Afternoon = Total

So, if 32 campers went fishing that day, the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon must be:

Total - Morning = Afternoon

Now we can solve for ""Afternoon"" using the information given in the question:

Total = 15 + (more arrived in the afternoon)
Afternoon = Total - 15

Substituting the values we know into the equation, we get:

Afternoon = 32 - 15
Afternoon = 17

Therefore, 17 campers went fishing in the afternoon."
Response:  If some campers went fishing in the morning and 7 of them went fishing in the afternoon, then the number of campers who went fishing in the morning is equal to the total number of campers minus the number of campers who went fishing in the afternoon. So, if 60 campers went fishing that day, then the number of campers who went fishing in the morning is 60 - 7 = 53.
Response:  We know that 36 campers went fishing in the morning, 13 in the afternoon, and 49 at night. So, we have to add all these numbers together to find out how many campers fished altogether. Therefore, the total number of campers who went fishing is: 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers.
Response:  We know that 44 campers left in the morning, and 39 left in the afternoon. So, there are 6 more campers who left in the morning than in the afternoon (44 - 39 = 5). Therefore, 5 more campers left in the morning than at night (31 - 5 = 26).
Response:  We know that 53 campers left in the morning and 48 campers left in the afternoon. So, there are more campers who left in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, we can say that 53 - 48 = 5 more campers left in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  The number of campers who left in the morning is given as 33. Then, we are told that 34 campers left in the afternoon and 10 campers left at night. So, if there were more campers who left in the afternoon than at night, we can write an inequality:

33 + 34 > 10

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

67 > 10

Therefore, there were 57 more campers who left in the afternoon than at night."
Response:  We know that 13 campers went rowing in the morning and 59 went hiking. In addition, 21 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 13 + 59 = 72. Therefore, 72 campers went rowing altogether.
"Response:  We know that 29 campers went rowing in the morning and 66 campers walked in the morning. So, the total number of campers who went rowing or walking in the morning is:

29 + 66 = 95

Now we are told that 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went rowing in both the morning and afternoon is:

95 - 26 = 69

Therefore, there were more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon. The difference between these two numbers is:

69 - 29 = 40

So, there were 40 more campers who went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that 41 campers went swimming in the morning and 26 did so in the afternoon. So, in total, there were 41 + 26 = 67 campers who went swimming or walked during the day.
Response:  We know that 43 campers went rowing in the morning and some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation: 43 + x = 46 (where x is the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 43: x / 43 = 20 (since there are 20 campers who went rowing in the afternoon). Therefore, 20 campers went rowing in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples on the tree, then after picking the 4 apples, there would be 3 remaining apples on the tree (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples still on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples in her tree. Then she picked some of them and now there are only two left. So, Rachel picked 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 mature apples from the tree and now there are only 5 left. So, if 3 of them are mature, then how many are not mature? Well, we can deduce that 2 are not mature because there are only 5 apples left in total (both mature and immature). Therefore, the number of immature apples is 2.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked two mature apples from the tree. So, there were 2 + 2 = 4 apples left on the tree. Then, six of them ripened and became mature, leaving 4 - 6 = 0 mature apples on the tree. Therefore, the number of mature apples the tree had at the beginning was 0.
Response:  Rachel picked six mature apples from the tree. Now there are two mature apples and four immature apples on the tree. So, initially, the tree had 6 + 2 = 8 apples.
Response:  If Rachel picked three mature apples from the tree and now there are two mature apples left, then initially there were five mature apples on the tree (3 + 2 = 5).
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. So, after that, there were 6 apples left on the tree (the original 6 + the new 2). Therefore, the number of apples the tree had at the beginning was 6.
Response:  The tree had two apples initially. Then, Rachel picked four apples from it. So, there were three apples left on the tree (2 - 4 = 3). After that, three new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, the total number of apples in the tree now is 3 + 3 = 6 apples.
Response:  If Rachel had 52 apples to start with and she picked two from one of the trees, then there were 50 apples left on that tree. Now, if we subtract the number of apples Rachel picked (2) from the total number of apples on the tree (50), we get 48 apples remaining on the tree. So, the answer is 48.
Response:  If Rachel had 3 apple trees and she collected 8 apples from each tree, then she collected a total of 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). Now, there are still 9 apples left on all the trees. So, initially, there were 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 apples in all the trees.
Response:  If Rachel has 4 apple trees and she picked 7 apples from each tree, then she collected a total of 4 x 7 = 28 apples. So, there are still 29 - 28 = 1 more apple left on the trees. Therefore, Rachel picked 1 apple in total.
Response:  We know that initially, Ed had two more balls than Doug. So, Ed had 20 balls and Doug had 18 balls. Then, Doug lost some balls in the park. Now, we know that Ed has 19 balls more than Doug. Therefore, Doug must have lost 1 ball.
Response:  If the Ed had 10 more balls than the Doug, that means he has 45 + 10 = 55 balls in total. Since the Doug lost 11 balls in the park, his remaining number of balls is 45 - 11 = 34 balls. So, the difference between the number of balls the Ed and Doug have is 55 - 34 = 21 balls. Therefore, the Ed has 21 more balls than the Doug.
Response:  If the Ed had six more balls than Doug, that means he has 22 - 6 = 16 balls initially. When Doug lost 7 of his balls in the park, he now has 16 + 7 = 23 balls. So, the Doug has 23 balls now.
Response:  If the Ed had five more balls than Doug, that means the Ed has x balls and Doug has x - 5 balls. Since Doug lost three balls in the park, he now has (x - 5) - 3 = 24 balls. So, the Doug had 24 balls.
"Response:  The Ed had 24 more balls than Doug. If he found 9 additional balls, then...

Step-by-step solution:
Let X be the number of balls that Doug had initially. Since the Ed had 24 more balls than Doug, the Ed had X + 24 balls initially.

The Doug lost 27 balls in the park, so his new amount of balls is:
Doug's new ball count = X - 27

Now, we need to find out how many balls the Ed had after finding 9 additional balls. So, let's subtract the number of balls the Ed found from his initial ball count:
Ed's new ball count = X + 24 - 9 = X + 15

So, the Ed had 15 more balls than Doug after losing 27 balls in the park and finding 9 additional balls."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more balls than Doug. If Ed lost 17 of his balls in the park, then he has fewer balls now than before. So, we can say:
Ed's current number of balls = Ed's initial number of balls - Number of balls lost in the park
= 29 + 17
= 46
Therefore, Ed has 46 balls more than Doug."
Response:  The Ed had 19 balls more than Doug. So, if he lost some of them in the park, he will have less balls now. If he has 8 balls more than Doug now, that means he lost 11 balls (8 - 19 = -11).
Response:  If the Ed had 30 more balls than Doug, then he must have started with 60 (Doug's initial number of balls) + 30 = 90 balls. Now, if he lost 21 balls in the park, his remaining number of balls would be 90 - 21 = 69 balls. So, the difference between the number of balls that Ed and Doug initially had is 69 - 91 = -22 balls. Therefore, Ed had fewer balls than Doug by 22 balls.
Response:  If the Ed had 12 balls more than Doug and lost 20 of his balls in the park, then he has fewer balls now. So, if the Ed had 17 balls initially, he must have 5 balls left after losing 20 (17 - 20 = 5). Therefore, the Doug has 32 balls (5 + 27).
"Response:  If 408 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we have:

Total number of students = 408 + 42 = 450

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon:

Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes = 408
Number of students who suggested bacon = 42

So, there are 408 - 42 = 366 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  If 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding something = 479 + 489 = 968

So, more students (968) suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes (479)."
Response:  The total number of students who participated in the survey is 310. Among them, 185 suggested adding potatoes to the menu as their first choice, while 35 suggested adding bacon as their second choice (since some students may have preferred both options). Therefore, we can conclude that 185 + 35 = 220 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  The total number of students who participated in the survey is 288. Of these, 264 suggested adding bacon to the menu, while 20 (or 7%) suggested adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, 20 students sugered puré de batatas.
"Response:  If 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 more students suggested it than those who suggested bacon (x), then we can write an equation as follows:

457 + x = 63

Now, let's solve for ""x"":

x = 457 - 63

So, 49 students suggested bacon."
"Response:  If 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 166 students more suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes, then we can say that 

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ bacon = 166 - (Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ mashed\ potatoes) $$

Now, let's find out how many students suggested mashed potatoes. According to the question, ""182 students sugeriram adicionar puré de batatas."" So, the number of students suggesting mashed potatoes is $182$.

Now, substitute this value in the equation:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ students\ suggesting\ bacon = 166 - (182) = -16 $$

So, there are $16$ students who suggested adding bacon."
Response:  If 324 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu, and 374 students suggested adding bacon, then together they made up 698 students (324 + 374 = 698). And if 128 students suggested adding tomatoes, that makes it 826 students in total who participated in suggesting new food items (698 + 128 = 826). So, there were 826 students who participated in the suggestion of new food items.
"Response:  The total number of students who suggested adding purée de patates is 257 (since 257 students suggested this option). Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding purée de patates than those who suggested adding bacon. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who suggested adding bacon from the number of students who suggested adding purée de patates:

Number of students who suggested adding purée de patates - Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 257 - 120 = 137

Therefore, more students suggested adding purée de patates than those who suggested adding bacon."
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding purée of potatoes is 144, and the total number of students is 467 (since 467 students sugered adding bacon). So, we can say that 144/467 = x, where x represents the percentage of students who suggested adding purée of potatoes. Since x is a fraction, it means that more than half of the students (58%) suggested adding purée of potatoes.
Response:  The total number of students who suggested adding purée de patates is 228. The total number of students who suggested adding bacon is 337 (since 337 students sugeriram addin Bacon). And the total number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is 23 ( since 23 students sugeriram addin Tomates). So, we can say that more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding tomatoes or purée de patates.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students, 45 (450 - 38) did not participate in suggesting new food items. So, the number of students who participated is 410 (450 - 45).
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding purée of potatoes and bacon while 351 students suggested just adding bacon to the menu, then we can say that 569 (218 + 351) students made suggestions related to bacon. Therefore, 569 students sugestadd bacon.
Response:  The total number of students who suggested adding bacon is 269. The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 330. And the total number of students who suggested adding tomatoes is 76. So, we can conclude that more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon (330 vs 269). Moreover, more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes (330 vs 76).
Response:  According to the question, there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the number of boys. So, if we subtract 34 from 841, we get: 807 - 34 = 773. Therefore, there are 773 more boys than girls in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 232 girls in the school and 485 students altogether. So, if we divide the number of girls (232) by the total number of students (485), we get...
(232/485) = 0.476 or approximately 47% of the students are girls. Therefore, there are approximately 47% boys and 53% girls in the school."
"Response:  If there are 697 students in total and 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to... (1)

Step 1: Write an equation based on the information given in the question.
Let B be the number of boys in the school. Since there are 697 students in total, we can write:
B + 228 = 697 (1)

Step 2: Solve for B using substitution or elimination method.
We will use substitution method here. Substituting B = 469 into equation (1), we get:
469 + 228 = 697 (2)
Solving for B, we get:
B = 469 (3)
Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and 510 more boys than girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys Total number of students = 635 - x Where x is the number of girls. Since there are more boys than girls, x is less than 635. Therefore, the number of boys in that school is: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Number of boys = 635 - x Now we can find out how many boys there are by substituting the value of x into the equation above. For example, if x = 320 (which is a reasonable estimate), then the number of boys would be: Number of boys = 635 - 320 = 315 So, there are approximately 315 boys in that school.
Response:  If there are 868 students in total and 281 more girls than boys, then the number of boys is equal to... (do the calculation)
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in total and 142 more boys than girls. So, if we have x number of girls, then we have x + 142 number of boys. Therefore, the total number of students = x + (x + 142) = 700. Solving for x, we get x = 358. So, there are 358 girls and 358 + 142 = 496 boys in the school.
"Response:  The original number of girls in the school is 706. Then, 418 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is 706 + 418 = 1124. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of boys in the school as follows: initially, there were 222 boys in the school; then, 418 more boys joined the school, so the total number of boys now is 222 + 418 = 640. Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is 1124 (girls) + 640 (boys) = 1764."
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls Joined = 902 + 44 = 946 girls Now, let's find out how many boys are left in the school after 44 girls joined: Number of boys = Initial number of boys - Number of new boys Left = 811 -? = 767 boys Therefore, there are 946 girls and 767 boys in the school now.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, the total number of girls is now:

632 + 465 = 1097

So, the number of girls in the school is greater than the number of boys. The difference between these two numbers can be calculated as follows:

Number of girls - Number of boys = 1097 - 410 = 687

Therefore, there are 687 more girls than boys in the school."
"Response:  The initial number of girls in the school is 732. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is:

732 + 682 = 1414

Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school now."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 135 boys and 214 girls in the school. Then, another 496 girls and 910 boys entered the school. So, the total number of boys in the school now is: 
Boys = Initial + New Boys = 214 + 910 = 1124
Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school now."
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. As for the teachers, we have 36 professionals. So, the total number of people at the school is 626 (students) plus 36 (teachers), which equals 662.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. Therefore, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. As for the teachers, we have 772. So, the total number of people at the school is 624 (students) plus 772 (teachers), which equals 1,496.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are 402 girls and 739 girls, then there must be fewer boys. Let's assume that there are x boys in the school. Since we know that the total number of students is 739 + 402 = 1141, we can set up the equation: x + 402 = 1141. Now solve for x to find out how many boys there are in the school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school. So, if there are 458 boys and 692 girls, then the total number of students is equal to the number of girls plus the number of boys. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows: Number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of students = 692 + 458 = 1150. Thus, there are 1150 students in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 257 girls and 362 boys in the school. Then, another 403 girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 257 + 403 = 650 girls. Now, let's find out how many more girls than boys are in the school: Number of girls - Number of boys = 650 - 362 = 288 more girls than boys.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward has $2 now.
Response:  If Edward had $13 and he spent some money, then he has less money now. So, the amount of money that Edward spent is equal to the difference between his original amount of money ($13) and the new amount of money he has ($3). Therefore, the amount of money that Edward spent is $10 (=$13 - $3).
Response:  Before spending $8, Edward had $9 + $8 = $17. So he had $17 before spending any money.
Response:  The total cost of all 92 books is $16 x 92 = $1472. Since he has only $6 left after buying the books, we can deduce that his initial amount was $1472 - $6 = $1466. So, before buying the books, Edward had $1466.
Response:  If Ed paid $6 for each book, then he spent a total of $6 + $6 = $12. So, each book cost him half of that amount, which is $6 / 2 = $3 per book.
Response:  The total amount of money that Edward had before he spent any money was $6 + $16 = $22. So, after spending $6 for books and $16 for pens, Edward has $22 - $6 - $16 = $6 left. Therefore, Edward had $6 before he spent any money.
Response:  The total amount of money that Edward spent is given as $12. Since he spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, we know that his total spending was $4 + $3 = $7. So, Edward spent $7 on books and pens combined.
Response:  The total amount of money that Edward spent is given as $16 + $8 = $24. So he has $19 - $24 = $-5 left after buying both books and pens. Therefore, Edward spent more on books than on pens.
Response:  Before he spent $17, Edward had $17 + x = 27 dollars (where x is the amount of money he received from his friend). Now, after spending $17 and receiving $10 from his friend, Edward has $17 - $10 = $7 left. So, before he spent any money, Edward had $27 - $7 = $20 dollars.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 flexions in class today and David made 58 more than Zachary. So, if we add 44 to 58, we get... (insert your calculation here).
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 flexions and David made 44 flexions. To find out how many more flexions Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of flexions David made from the number of flexions Zachary made: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary made 7 more flexions than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 flexions in class today and Zachary did 9 more than David. So, if David made 44 flexions, then Zachary made 44 + 9 = 53 flexions.
Response:  We know that David made 51 flexions and Zachary made 49 more than David. So, Zachary made 51 + 49 = 100 flexions in total.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 flexions and 44 abdominal crunches in class today. And we also know that David did more flexions than Zachary but fewer than him. So, if David did x flexions, then he did (x - 27) flexions less than Zachary did. Therefore, David did 32 flexions.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 flexions and 17 abdominal crunches in class today. David did more flexions than Zachary (by 29), but fewer abdominal crunches (by 13). So, if David did x abdominal crunches, then he did 13 + x = 60 abdominal crunches in total. Therefore, David did 60 abdominal crunches.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 flexions and 14 abdominal crunches in class today. If David did more than Zachary, then he must have done at least 53 + 1 = 54 flexions and 14 + 1 = 15 abdominal crunches. So, the total number of flexions Zachary did is 53, and the total number of abdominal crunches he did is 14. Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Flexions: 53
Abdominal Crunches: 14"
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 flexions and 3 abdominal exercises in class today. If we add these numbers together, we get 38 (35 + 3). Now, we are told that David did 58 more flexions than Zachary. This means that David did 58 - 38 = 20 more flexions than Zachary. However, we were also told that David did 87 fewer abdominal exercises than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 3 abdominal exercises, then David did 3 - 87 = -84 abdominal exercises. In other words, David did fewer abdominal exercises than Zachary. Therefore, the difference between the number of flexions that Zachary did and the number of abdominal exercises that he did is 20 - (-84) = 106. So, Zachary did 106 more flexions than abdominal exercises.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 flexions and 58 abdominal crunches in class today. David did more flexions than Zachary (38), but fewer abdominal crunches (58 - 62 = -4). So, Zachary did 46 + 4 = 50 abdominal crunches more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 flexions in class today. David did 39 more than Zachary, so David did 58 flexions (39 + 19). However, we also know that John did 13 fewer flexions than David, so David did 45 flexions (58 - 13). Therefore, David did 45 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 flexions in class today. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 flexions (51 + 22 = 73). Since John did 4 fewer than David, John did 69 flexions (73 - 4 = 69). So, John did 69 flexions in class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 flexions in class today and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 54 flexions (39 + 15). Now we are told that David did 9 more flexions than John. Therefore, John did 45 flexions (54 - 9). Finally, we want to find out how many flexions Zachary did compared to John. To do this, we subtract the number of flexions John did from the number of flexions Zachary did: 15 - 45 = -30. So, Zachary did 30 fewer flexions than John.
Response:  We know that David did 30 more flexions than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x flexions, then David did 30 + x flexions. Now we are told that David did 37 flexions. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: 37 = 30 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So, Zachary did 7 flexions in the class.
Response:  We know that David did 56 more flexions than Zachary. So if Zachary did x flexions, then David did 56 + x flexions. Also, we are told that David did 38 fewer flexions than Zachary. Therefore, the number of flexions done by Zachary is equal to the number of flexions done by David minus the number of flexions he did less than Zachary. In other words, Zachary did x = 38 - 56 = 18 flexions.
Response:  According to the question, David did more than 40 flexions but fewer than Zachary in their gymnastics class. So, if Zachary did x flexions, then David did more than x - 40 flexions. Also, we know that Zachary did 62 abdominal exercises and David did more than 17 fewer than Zachary. Therefore, David did 62 - 17 = 45 abdominal exercises.
Response:  According to the question, David made more than 36 flexions but fewer than 33 flexions than Zachary in their gymnastics class. So, if David did 39 flexions (for example), then Zachary would have done at least 42 flexions. Now, we know that Zachary did 58 flexions and 33 abdominal exercises, so he did 25 more flexions than abdominal exercises. Therefore, Zachary did 73 flexions (58 + 15).
Response:  According to the question, David made more than 27 bends and fewer than Zachary in their gymnastics class. So if David did 27 + x bends, then Zachary did x - 7 bends. Since Zachary performed 5 bends, we can say that he did (x - 7) = 5 bends. Now, according to the question, Zachary did more abdominal exercises than bends. Therefore, the number of abdominal exercises Zachary performed is equal to the number of bends he did not perform. So, Zachary performed (5 - x) abdominal exercises. Finally, we know that David performed more abdominal exercises than Zachary, so the difference between the number of abdominal exercises David performed and the number of abdominal exercises Zachary performed is equal to the number of bends David performed minus the number of bends Zachary performed. That is, the difference between 32 and 5 is equal to the difference between 27 and 0. Thus, David performed 25 additional abdominal exercises compared to Zachary.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. So, she had more math homework than reading comprehension. In numbers, the difference between the number of math pages and reading pages is 5 - 2 = 3 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than of reading comprehension.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to make 7 pages of homework (3 pages of math and 4 pages of reading). So, she had more pages of reading than of mathematics. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of reading and math is equal to the total number of pages of homework that Rachel had to make. In this case, the difference is 4 - 3 = 1 page. So, Rachel had 1 extra page of reading homework than of math homework.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and an additional 2 pages of reading comprehension, then she had to complete a total of 7 pages of homework. So, if she completed 5 pages of math homework, she had to complete 2 more pages of reading comprehension, which is equal to 1 page of homework in total. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 6 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of homework in mathematics and she completed more than 4 pages of reading homework than her original assignment, then we can say that she had to complete 3 pages (7 - 4 = 3) of additional reading homework. So, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework beyond her original assignment.
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework in mathematics and she had to complete more than 3 pages of additional homework in mathematics than she did for reading comprehension, then we can say that...

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Rachel had to complete for mathematics homework.
8 pages x = 8/1 = 8 pages

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Rachel had to complete for reading comprehension homework.
Let's assume she had to complete x pages for reading comprehension.

Step 3: Find out how many pages Rachel had to complete in total.
Add the number of pages she had to complete for mathematics homework and reading comprehension homework.
8 pages + x pages = Total pages

So, Rachel had to complete 8 + x = 11 pages in total."
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework in math and she completed more than 6 pages of reading assignment, then we can say that she completed 8 - 6 = 2 pages of reading assignment. So, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading assignment.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 10 pages of homework in mathematics, and she completed more than 3 pages of extra math homework, then she had to complete a total of 10 + 3 = 13 pages of homework.
"Response: 
Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math worksheets, which means she needed to do 4 pages in total (since each page has 2 sides).
Then, she had to complete 3 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, which also means she needed to do 6 pages in total (again, since each page has 2 sides).
Finally, she had to complete 10 pages of science worksheets, which means she needed to do 20 pages in total (also with 2 sides per page).
So, in total, Rachel needed to complete 4 + 6 + 20 = 30 pages of homework!"
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 9 pages of homework in mathematics, 2 pages of reading comprehension, and 96 pages of science homework. To find out how many more pages she had to complete in mathematics than in reading, we need to subtract the number of pages she had to complete in reading from the total number of pages she had to complete in mathematics. So, if we subtract 2 from 9, we get 7. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 more pages of mathematics homework than she did for reading comprehension.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. Additionally, she had to complete 3 more pages of science homework than math homework. So, if she completed 11 pages of math homework, then she had to complete 8 pages (11 - 3) of science homework. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of biology homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework, and 8 pages of science homework. So far, she has completed a total of 26 pages (7 + 11 + 8). To find out how many more pages of science homework she had to do, we can subtract the number of pages she completed from the total number of pages required: 26 - 8 = 18. Therefore, Rachel had 18 more pages of science homework to complete.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading homework. Therefore, she had to complete a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in these subjects. However, there is also a mention that she had to complete an additional 29 pages of work in biology. So, in addition to the 20 pages mentioned above, Rachel had to complete another 29 pages of work in biology, making the total number of pages she had to complete 20 + 29 = 49 pages.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she needed to complete 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework in total. However, we are also given that she completed 3 additional pages of biology homework, so she actually completed 15 + 3 = 18 pages of homework in total.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework, which is equal to 5/1 = 5 pages. Then, she had to complete 10 pages of reading homework, which is equal to 10/1 = 10 pages. Finally, she had to complete 6 pages of science homework, which is equal to 6/1 = 6 pages. Therefore, in total, Rachel had to complete 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages of homework.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to make 2 pages of homework in math and 4 pages of homework in reading. So, she had to make a total of 6 pages of homework (2 + 4 = 6).
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 4 pages of homework in math and 19 pages of biology. So, she completed (4 + 19) = 23 pages of work overall. Since she had more pages of biology than math, that means she had x - 4 = 23 pages of math homework left to complete, where x is the number of pages of math homework she had to complete. Therefore, the answer is x = 6 pages of math homework.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails in the morning and two in the afternoon. So, he received a total of eight emails (6 + 2). Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and those he received in the afternoon is 8 - 6 = 2.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails in the morning and eight at afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:
6 + x = 8 (where x is the number of emails Jack received at afternoon)
Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?"
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 5 emails that day. Since we know he received 4 emails in the morning, then he must have received 1 email in the afternoon (since 5 - 4 = 1). Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails in the morning, three in the afternoon, and five at night. So, he received a total of 14 emails per day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 in the evening. So, he received a total of 13 emails. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received a total of 9 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). Now, we are asked how many emails he received at night. Since it is mentioned that he received 8 emails at night, the answer is 8. So, the number of emails Jack received at night is 8.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails at night. So, he received a total of 11 emails (3 + 8 = 11).
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 in the afternoon, and 17 at night. So, we can write:

Morning = 10 emails
Afternoon = 7 emails
Night = 17 emails

Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received in the morning with the number he received in the afternoon:

Number of emails received in the morning - Number of emails received in the afternoon = 10 - 7 = 3

So, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails at night. So, we can write an equation:

Morning = 9 + 10 = 19
Afternoon = 10
Night = 7
Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received during each time period:

Morning > Afternoon (19 > 10)
Morning < Night (19 < 7)
Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did at night. The difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and those he received at night is 2 (19 - 7)."
"Response:  According to the question, in the morning, Jack received 10 emails. In the afternoon, he received 5 emails. And at night, he received 4 emails. So, we can write this information as follows:

Morning: 10 emails
Afternoon: 5 emails
Night: 4 emails
Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received during the afternoon with the number of emails he received at night:

Number of emails received at night = 4 emails
Number of emails received during the afternoon = 5 emails
So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received at night and those he received during the afternoon is:

Difference = Number of emails received at night - Number of emails received during the afternoon
= 4 emails - 5 emails
= -1 email
Therefore, Jack received fewer emails at night than he did during the afternoon."
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails in the morning and three in the afternoon. So he received nine emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Since we are asked how many emails Jack received at ""à tarde,"" which means ""in the afternoon"" in Portuguese, we can conclude that he did not receive any more emails after 3 PM. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received at ""à tarde"" is zero."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning. In addition, he received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 3 + 5 = 8 emails per day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning. In addition, he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 14 (5 + 6) letters and 12 (9 + 7) emails. Therefore, Jack received a total of 26 letters and emails that day.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. In addition, he received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon. So, we can write:

Emails received in the morning = 10
Emails received in the afternoon = 3
Letters received in the morning = 12
Letters received in the afternoon = 44

Now, let's compare the number of emails received in the morning with the number of emails received in the afternoon:

Number of emails received in the morning - Number of emails received in the afternoon = 10 - 3 = 7

Therefore, Jack received 7 more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received six emails and eight letters in the morning. Then he received two emails and seven letters in the afternoon. So, we can say that Jack received more letters than emails in the morning. Therefore, the difference between the number of letters Jack received in the morning and the afternoon is:
6 - 2 = 4 letters
So, Jack received four more letters in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters during the morning. Therefore, he received 2 emails and sent 74 letters during the afternoon. So, we can say that Jack receives 2 emails per day.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
* Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters in the morning. So he received 4 + 2 = 6 emails and sent 2 letters.
* In the afternoon, Jack received 6 emails and sent 8 letters. So he received 6 x 2 = 12 emails and sent 8 letters.
Therefore, Jack sends an average of 8 emails per day (12 emails / 2 times)."
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 + x emails in the afternoon, where x is the number of emails he received after lunchtime. Since we are told that Jack received a total of 9 emails in the day, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 9. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. So Jack received 2 additional emails in the afternoon.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jack received 3 emails at lunchtime, 5 emails at dawn and 16 emails at night. So, we can write down the following equation:

Lunchtime = 3
Dawn = 5
Night = 16

Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received during each time period:

Manhã (dawn) > Lunchtime (3) > Night (16)

Therefore, the answer is: Jack received more emails in the morning than he did at lunchtime or at night."
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails at dawn. So he received a total of 9 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received 2 emails at afternoon.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 12 inches. So, we can say that the difference between their jumps is 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 3 more inches than the gafanhotto.
Response:  The gafanhoto jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches. So together they jumped 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 36 inches (polegadas), which means that it covered a distance of 36 inches in one jump. Then, the frog jumped 17 inches more than the cricket, so it covered a distance of 36 + 17 = 53 inches. Finally, the rat jumped 15 inches more than the frog, so it covered a distance of 53 + 15 = 68 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 68 inches.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 25 inches (polegadas), which means that it covered a distance of 25 x 0.3 = 7.5 feet (pés). Then, the frog jumped 18 inches more than the cricket, so it jumped 7.5 + 18 = 25.5 feet. Finally, the rat jumped 2 inches more than the frog, so it jumped 25.5 + 2 = 27.5 feet. Therefore, the rat jumped 27.5 feet.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 30 cm, the frog jumped x cm more than the cricket and the rat jumped y cm more than the frog. We know that the total distance traveled by the frog is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the other two animals plus its own distance. So we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = (Cricket + Frog) + Rat. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Distance = (30 + x) + y. Solving for y, we find that the rat jumped 40 cm more than the gafanhotto. Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 30 cm, which means it covered a distance of 30 cm in one jump. Since the sapo jumped 39 inches more than the gafanhotto, we can say that the sapo jumped 39 + 30 = 69 cm (or 27 inches). Finally, since the rat jumped 94 inches less than the sapo, we can say that the rat jumped 94 - 69 = 25 inches (or 63 cm). So, the sapo jumped a total distance of 69 cm (or 27 inches) away from its starting point.
Response:  The gafanhotto jumped 25 inches (polegadas), which means that it covered a distance of 25 x 12 = 300 inches in total. Then, the frog jumped 32 more inches than the cricket, so its total distance traveled was 300 + 32 = 332 inches. Finally, the rat jumped 26 fewer inches than the frog, so its total distance traveled was 332 - 26 = 306 inches. Therefore, the rat jumped 306 inches.
Response:  The rat jumped less than the frog (by 5 polegades). So, if the frog jumped x polegades, then the rat jumped x - 5 polegades. Now we know that the frog jumped 33 more polegades than the cricket (since it jumped 24 + 33 = 57 polegades), so the rat jumped 57 - 5 = 52 polegades fewer than the frog.
Response:  The frog jumped 5 cm more than the grasshopper, so it jumped 18 polegadas (5 cm x 3.6 = 18 inches). Therefore, the frog jumped 18 + 13 = 31 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 35 inches (or 89 cm). Since we know that the toad jumped 10 cm more than the frog, the toad jumped 49 cm (or 193 in). So, in total, both of them jumped 89 + 193 = 282 cm or 111.6 in.
Response:  We know that the toad jumped 15 cm less than the sapo and the frog jumped 30 cm. So if the toad jumped x cm, then the sapo jumped 30 - x cm. Since the rat jumped farther than the toad, we can say that the distance between the rat and the toad is greater than the distance between the toad and the sapo. Therefore, the distance between the rat and the sapo is equal to the difference between their jumps minus the distance between the toad and the sapo. That is, (x + 15) - (30 - x). Solving for x gives us x = 45 cm.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches (polegadas). The toad jumped more than 30 cm than the frog, so it jumped 39 + 30 = 69 cm. Now we need to find out how much the rat jumped. Since the rat jumped less than the frog and the frog jumped 69 cm, the rat jumped 69 - x cm, where x is a number between 0 and 69.
Response:  The gafanhoto jumped 21 inches (polegadas) and then added another 25 inches to that distance, making it 46 inches total (or 39 polegadas). Since the rat jumped 16 inches less than the sapo, the rat jumped 30 inches (or 76 polegadas). So, the gafanhoto jumped 16 more inches than the rat, which is 32 inches or 81 polegadas.
"Response:  The difference between the height of the jump made by the frog and that made by the toad is equal to the number of inches that the frog jumped minus the number of inches that the toad jumped. So we can write this as follows: 
Frog jump distance = Frog jump height - Toad jump height
In this case, the frog jumped 39 polegadas (or inches) and the toad jumped 17 polegadas (or inches). Therefore, we can calculate the difference in jumps as follows: 
Difference in jumps = 39 - 17 = 22 inches
So, the frog jumped 22 more inches than the toad."
Response:  The rat jumped less than the frog and more than the mole. So if the frog jumped x centimeters, the mole jumped x - 10 centimeters, and the rat jumped x - 20 centimeters (since it jumped less than the frog). Therefore, the rat jumped 15 + 20 = 35 centimeters.
"Response:  The rat jumped x cm more than the frog. Since the frog jumped 37 inches and the gafanhot jumped 15 cm, we can write:
x = 37 - 15 = 22 cm
So, the rat jumped 22 cm more than the frog."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour than she has already added (since the recipe requires 14 - 5 = 9 more cups). So, she needs to add 9 + 6 = 15 more cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 15 more cups of sugar than she has already added.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 5 more xícaras of sugar than she has already added (4) to make 9 xícaras in total. So, she needs to add 5 + 4 = 9 xícaras of sugar.
Response:  If Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour than sugar, and the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar... So if she has already added some flour (copos), then she needs to add 8 - (the amount she has already added) = 8 - x cups of flour. Where x is the amount she has already added.
Response:  If Mary has already put some cups of flour and needs to add more, we can start by finding out how many cups of flour she has already added. The question states that she needs 11 cups of flour in total, so if she has already put some cups of flour, then she still needs to add 11 - (the number of cups of flour she has already put) cups of flour. Now, let's find out how many cups of flour she has already put. According to the question, she has already put some copos of flour. Since there are 8 copos in a cup, Mary has already put 8 x 8 = 64 copos of flour. So, she still needs to add 11 - 64 = 5 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour to make the bola.
Response:  The recipe asks for 11 cups of sugar and some more flour. Mary has already added 3 cups of flour. So, if she needs to add 6 more cups of flour, how many total cups will she need in total? Therefore, the answer is 9 cups (11 - 3 + 6).
Response:  If Mary has already put 3 cups of flour (copos), and the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour in total, then she still needs to add 9 more cups of flour (12 - 3 = 9). So, she will need an additional 2 x cups of flour (since there are 2 x cups left to be added). Therefore, the final answer is 2 x 3 = 6 cups of flour remaining to be added.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 xícaras of farina and 62 xícaras of sugar to her dough. The recipe requires 9 xícaras of farina and 5 xícaras of sugar. So, we need to find out how many xícaras of farina she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar (62 xícaras) by the number of sugar required in the recipe (5 xícaras): 62 / 5 = 12.4 xícaras. Since we cannot have a fraction of an xícara, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 xícaras. Therefore, Mary needs to add 13 more xícaras of farina to her dough.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 xícaras of sugar to the mixture and the recipe requires 14 - 2 = 12 xícaras of sugar in total. So, Mary needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 more xícaras of sugar to the mixture.
Response:  We know that the total amount of flour needed is 12 xícaras and we have already added 11 xícaras. So, to find out how many more xícaras she needs to add, we can subtract the number of xícaras she has already added from the total amount needed: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more xícara of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to make 10 xícaras of farina for her cake recipe. She has already added 7 xícaras of farina, so she still needs 3 xícaras more (10 - 7 = 3). Since each xícara of farina contains 4 cups, Mary needs 3 x 4 = 12 cups of farina more. Now, we know that the total amount of sugar required is 2 xícaras, and since there are 4 cups in each xícara, Mary needs 2 x 4 = 8 cups of sugar. Finally, we know that the total amount of salt required is 80 xícaras, and since there are 4 cups in each xícara, Mary needs 80 / 4 = 20 cups of salt. So, to summarize, Mary needs 12 cups of farina, 8 cups of sugar, and 20 cups of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour than she has already added (2 cups). So, if she has already added 2 cups of flour, then she needs to add 6 + 2 = 8 more cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than she has already added.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 xícaras of flour to make the dough. The total amount of flour required is 6 xícaras. So, we need to find out how many more xícaras of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (6 - 5 = 1) by the amount of flour she has already added (5). This means that Mary needs to add an additional 1 xícara of flour. Now, let's check if she has enough salt and sugar. According to the recipe, the total amount of salt required is 7 xícaras, and Mary has already added 5 xícaras of salt. So, she still needs to add 2 xícaras of salt. Similarly, the total amount of sugar required is 8 xícaras, and Mary has already added 5 xícaras of sugar. So, she still needs to add 3 xícaras of sugar. Therefore, the answer is: Mary needs to add 1 xícara of flour, 2 xícaras of salt, and 3 xícaras of sugar to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar (since she has already added 2). So, we need to find out how many cups are in 11. There are 8 cups in 1 pint, and there are 2 pints in 1 quart. Therefore, there are 16 cups in 1 quart. Now, since Mary wants to make 13 cups of batter, we can divide 13 by 16 to get the number of quarts she needs:

13 / 16 = 0.8125 quarts
So, Mary needs to add 0.8125 quarts of sugar to her mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 xícaras of sugar to the mixture and the recipe requires 6 xícaras of sugar in total. So, we need to find out how many more xícaras of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the amount of sugar required (6 xícaras) by the amount of sugar she has already added (4 xícaras):

6 - 4 = 2

So, Mary needs to add 2 xícaras of flour more than the amount of sugar she has already added. In other words, she needs to add 2 xícaras of flour now."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add more flour than sugar. The recipe asks for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 7 cups of flour (9 - 2 = 7). To find out how many cups of flour she needs to add, we divide the amount of flour needed by the number of cups she has already added: 7 / 2 = 3.5 cups. Since you can't have a half cup of flour, Mary needs to add 4 cups of flour in total.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 xícaras of flour to make the dough. To find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add, we can use the following equation:

Sugar needed = Total amount of sugar required - Amount of sugar already added
= 5 xícaras - 11 xícaras
= -6 xícaras
So, Mary needs to add 6 xícaras of sugar more than what is required in the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has already put some flour in the bowl and needs to add more, then she will need to add 5 xícaras of flour for every xícara of sugar she has already added. So if she has already added 3 xícaras of sugar, she will need to add 15 xícaras of flour (5 x 3). Therefore, she still needs 2 xícaras of flour.
"Response:  If Mary needs to add 12 more xícaras of flour, and she has already put in some amount (let's call it x), then we can write an equation as follows:

Total amount of flour needed = 12 + x

Now, we know that the total amount of flour needed is equal to 5 times the amount of sugar needed, plus 13 times the amount of flour needed. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

5x + 13(12 + x) = 5x + 65

Simplifying the equation, we get:

18 + 78 = 93

Subtracting 78 from both sides gives us:

18 = 15

So, Mary needs to add 15 more xícaras of flour to make the bola."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 xícaras of farina and 60 xícaras of sugar to her dough. The recipe calls for a total of 14 xícaras of farina. So, we need to find out how many more xícaras of farina she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the amount of farina needed (14) by the amount of farina she has already added (7): 14 / 7 = 2. Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 more xícaras of farina to her dough.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 xícaras of sugar and 12 xícaras of flour to make the cake. To find out how many more xícaras of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount required (11 xícaras - 10 xícaras = 1). So, Mary needs to add 1 more xícara of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  We know that the total amount of sugar is 3x + 10x = 13x, and the total amount of flour is 6x + 15x = 21x. So we need to find out how much flour Mary has already added. Since she has put 6x = 6 cups of flour so far, we need to add another 15x - 6x = 9 cups of flour to make the total amount equal to 21x. Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour.
"Response:  We know that the total amount of sugar required is 9x + 14x = 23x. Since Mary has already added 4x of flour, we need to find out how much more flour she needs to add. So, we can set up an equation as follows:

23x - 4x = (total amount of flour needed)

Solving for x, we get:

19x = (total amount of flour needed)

Therefore, Mary needs 19x more flour than sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 6 xícaras of flour (since she already added 2 xícaras). So, if we divide the total amount of flour needed (9 xícaras) by the amount she has already added (2 xícaras), we get the remaining amount: 9 - 2 = 7 xícaras. Therefore, Mary needs 7 more xícaras of flour than she needs salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour, so she needs to add another 6 - 12 = 4 cups of flour. Now, we need to calculate how many cups of sugar and salt are required based on the amount of flour used. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt, and Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, she needs to add 11 - 12 = -1 cup of sugar and 9 - 12 = -3 cups of salt. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of sugar and 3 cups of salt to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to her mixture and the recipe calls for 7 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (7 cups) by the amount she has already added (4 cups):

Number of additional cups = Total amount needed / Amount already added = 7 cups / 4 cups = 1 3/4 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 1 3/4 cups of sugar to her mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 2 xícaras of flour (since she already has 10 xícaras of sugar). So, we need to find out how many xícaras of flour are in 2 xícaras. There are 8 xícaras in 1 cup, so...
Response:  We know that there are 19 families of birds near the mountain and they all migrate to warmer countries during winter. If 60% of these families migrated, then we can assume that 60/19 = 3.2 families migrated (since we rounded down). So, 3.2 families more than those who stayed behind migrated to warmer climates.
"Response:  If there are 87 families of birds that live near the mountain and 7 of them flew away to escape the winter, then the number of families of birds left behind is:

87 - 7 = 80

Therefore, 80 families of birds remained near the mountain after 7 families migrated for the winter."
Response:  We know that 20 families of birds left for warmer climates during winter and 14 families stayed behind. So, initially there were 20 + 14 = 34 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 23 families of birds flew to Africa and 37 families of birds flew to Asia. So, in total, 60 families of birds left their original location near the mountain. This means that 85 - 60 = 25 families of birds remained near the mountain. Therefore, 25 families of birds stayed near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 42 families of birds flew to Africa and 31 families of birds flew to Asia. So, the total number of families of birds that flew away is 42 + 31 = 73 families. Now, we are asked how many more families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of families that flew to Asia from the total number of families that flew away: 73 - 31 = 42 families. Therefore, 42 families of birds flew to Africa more than those who flew to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain. If 47 families of birds flew to Africa and 94 families of birds flew to Asia, then we can say that the number of families of birds that flew to Asia is greater than the number of families that flew to Africa by 94 - 47 = 47. So, 47 families of birds flew to Asia more than those who flew to Africa.
"Response:  We know that 38 families of birds flew to Africa and 80 families of birds flew to Asia. So, if we subtract these numbers from the total number of bird families (18), we get:

18 - 38 = 50

So, 50 families of birds remained in their original location near the mountain. Therefore, the answer is 50."
Response:  If there are already 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain is now 87 + 18 = 105 families.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds fled to warmer climates and 24 new families arrived at the mountain. So, the total number of bird families near the mountain is: 59 + 24 = 83 families.
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds flew to the winter near a mountain. So initially there were 68 - 27 = 41 families of birds near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain. Then, 86 families of birds flew away to go south for the winter. So, the total number of bird families now is:

Total = Initial + Newly Arrived
= 45 + 86
= 131

Therefore, 91 more families of birds flew away to go south for the winter than those who stayed behind."
"Response:  We know that 35 families of birds flew to Asia and 62 families of birds flew to Africa. So, we have:

35 + 62 = 97

Now, let's find out how many families of birds flew to Africa more than those who flew to Asia:

97 - 35 = 62

Therefore, 62 families of birds flew to Africa more than those who flew to Asia."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 families of birds living near the mountain and 26 new families arrived while 2 families flew south for winter. So, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is:
3 + 26 = 29
Therefore, 29 bird families live near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that Paul received $253$ pencils for his birthday and he lost or gave away $70$ of them. So, the number of pencils he had at the end of the school year is:
$$= 253 - 70 = 183 \text{ pencils}$$"
Response:  We know that Paul received $X$ pens in total for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had lost or given away $551$ pens, leaving him with $Y = X - 551$ pens. So, the number of pens Paul received is equal to $\boxed{X = 177}$.
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 pencils for his birthday and gave away 111 of them during the school year. This means he has 329 pencils left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that he lost 106 pencils. So, the final number of pencils Paul has is 329 - 106 = 223 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Paul received $65$ lighters for his birthday and gave away $213$ lighters during the school year. So he has given away more than he got. Now we are asked how many lighters were lost or donated. The word ""perdeu"" in Portuguese means ""lost"", so we can assume that some of the lighters Paul gave away were actually lost. Therefore, the number of lighters lost is equal to the difference between the number of lighters he gave away and the number he received. In other words, the number of lighters lost is $213 - 65 = 148$."
Response:  We know that Paul received $589$ pencils for his birthday and gave away $571$ of them to his friends during the school year. This means he has $161$ pencils left. Now, we need to find out how many more pencils he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of pencils he lost ($161$) from the number of pencils he gave away ($571$). So, the answer is $571 - 161 = 410$. Therefore, Paul gave away $410$ more pencils to his friends than he lost.
Response:  If Paul received 110 pens and gave away 90, then he has 21 left (110 - 90 = 21). Now, if he lost 412 pens, then he has a total of 633 pens (21 + 412 = 633). So, he lost more pens than he gave away. The difference between the two amounts is 412 - 90 = 322 pens. Therefore, Paul lost 322 pens more than he gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 pens during the school year and lost 558 of them. So he has 332 pens left. Now we are asked how many red pens he received as gift on his birthday. Since he only received 332 pens in total (both given away and lost), it means he did not receive any red pens as gift on his birthday. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 pens during the school year and lost or donated 535 pens in total. So if he only has 492 pens left, it means he must have given away more than he had at first (since 52 is less than 492). Therefore, the number of pens he gave away is equal to 492 - 52 = 440.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 521 pens and 66 erasers. If he didn't lose any eraser during the year, then he must have used some number of them to write with his pens. So, we can say that the number of erasers he used is equal to the number of pens he had minus the number of erasers he had initially. In other words, the number of erasers he used is given by: Number of erasers used = Pens - Erasers initially  Therefore, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of erasers used = 521 - 66 = 455 erasers. Since Paul did not lost or donated any eraser during the year, the total number of erasers he had at the end of the year is equal to the number of erasers he used plus the initial number of erasers he had: Total number of erasers = Number of erasers used + Erasers initially Total number of erasers = 455 + 66 = 521 erasers. So, Paul had 521 erasers left at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 531 pens and 38 erasers. If he didn't lose any eraser during the year, then he must have used 38 erasers throughout the year. Now, let's calculate how many pens he had left after using all those erasers. He had 531 pens initially, minus the number of erasers he used (38), equals to 493 pens left. So, Paul had 493 pens more than erasers at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 601 pens and 406 erasers. If he didn't lose any eraser during the year, then he must have used 205 erasers (406 - 201 = 205). Now we need to find out how many more erasers than pens he had at the end of the year. So, let's subtract the number of erasers he used from the total number of pens he had at the beginning of the year: 601 - 205 = 396. Therefore, Paul had 396 more erasers than pens at the end of the year.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 315 colored pens. If he received one more pen at his birthday party, then he has 316 pens now. However, in the end of the school year, only 291 pens are left, which means that he must have lost or given away 25 pens (316 - 291 = 25). So, Paul received 25 colored pens at his birthday party.
Response:  We know that Paul received $267$ pencils as a gift and lost $231$ of them during the school year. This means he has $267 - 231 = 36$ pencils left. Now, we are told that he gave away $308$ pencils to his friends. So, the number of pencils he gave away is greater than the number he had left ($308 > 36$). Therefore, the difference between the number of pencils he gave away and the number he had left is $308 - 36 = 272$.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 borrachas and 320 lápices de cor. If he didn't lose any, then at the end of the year, he would have 457 + 320 = 777 total items. So, if he received 523 more items during the year, then he must have received 523 - 777 = -354 items. Since it can't be negative, we conclude that Paul received no más than 354 lápices de cor during the year. Therefore, the answer is 354.
Response:  The employee had 11 clients initially. After some of them left, he still had 3 clients remaining. So, the number of clients that remained = 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  The employee had 3 clients initially and then some left, but we don't know how many. So, let X be the number of clients that left. Now, the employee still has 4 clients, so the total number of clients he has now is 3 + X = 7. Therefore, the number of clients who stayed more than those who left is 7 - X.
Response:  The employee had 9 clients at first and then lost 6 of them (since 9 - 6 = 3). So he still had 3 clients left after they all left. Therefore, he had 3 clients at the beginning.
Response:  The employee had 14 clients initially. If he still has 5 clients left, that means he lost 9 clients. So, the number of clients the employee still has is 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, the employee still has 5 clients.
Response:  The employee had 13 clients initially and then some left. After that, he gained 4 new clients. So, the total number of clients he had after gaining 4 new ones is 13 + 4 = 17. Now, if he still has 9 clients, it means that 8 clients have left (17 - 9 = 8). Therefore, there are 8 remaining clients.
Response:  The employee had 12 clients initially and 15 of them left, leaving him with none. Then, he got 14 new clients, so... (12 - 15) + 14 = 8. Therefore, the employee still has 8 clients.
Response:  The employee had 3 clients initially and then more clients arrived, making it 8 in total. So, the number of new clients that arrived is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  The employee had 8 clients initially. Then some left, leaving him with 5 clients. Later, he gained 99 new clients. So, the total number of clients he has now is: 5 + 99 = 104 clients. Therefore, there are 104 - 8 = 96 clients remaining.
Response:  The employee had 12 clients initially and some of them left, so he still had 14 clients after that. Then, he gained 10 new clients, bringing his total number to... (12 + 14) = 26! So, the employee has 26 clients now.
Response:  If he spent $2 for the chocolate and then got $1 more after buying it, that means he had $2 initially (the amount he spent). So, his initial balance was $2 + $1 = $3.
Response:  If O Dan had $4 initially and then spent $3 on a bar of chocolate, he would have $1 left ($4 - $3 = $1). So, the cost of the chocolate is $3.
Response:  If O Dan has $4 and he bought 99 bars of chocolate for $3 each, then he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. So, there is $4 - $297 = $-293 left over.
Response:  If O Dan paid $3 for each of the three bars of chocolate he bought, and then he paid $4 for each of those same two bars of chocolate, that means... (1) He spent $3 x 3 = $9 on the first set of three bars of chocolate. (2) Then, when he bought the second set of two bars of chocolate, he paid $4 x 2 = $8. So in total, O Dan spent $9 + $8 = $17 on all six bars of chocolate. Therefore, each bar of chocolate cost him $17 / 6 = $2.83.
"Response:  If O Dan has $2 dollars and he bought some bars of chocolate that cost $6 each, then he spent a total of $6 x number of bars = $12. Since he had only $2 to start with, we know that $12 is less than $2, so there must be fewer than 12 bars of chocolate. But we are not told how many exactly, so the answer is ""less than 12""."
Response:  If O Dan has $7 and he spent $2 for one bar of chocolate, then he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, if he bought another chocolate that cost $3, he would have $5 - $3 = $2 left. So, the amount of money that remains in O Dan's possession is $2.
Response:  The cost of one chocolate is $6 and the cost of the bar of chocolate is $7. So, if he bought one chocolate for $6, then he spent $6 + $6 = $12. If he also bought the bar of chocolate for $7, then he spent an additional $7. Therefore, in total, he spent $12 + $7 = $19.
Response:  The total amount of money spent by O Dan is $2 + $6 + $3 = $11. So, he spent more money buying one bar of chocolate than he did buying chocolates. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is $11 - $3 = $8.
Response:  The total amount of money spent by O Dan is $5 + $2 + $3 = $10. So he spent $10 on chocolate and $5 on potatoes (since there is no information about how much he spent on other items). Therefore, he spent more money on chocolate than on potatoes.
Response:  If O Dan has $4 and buys something for $8, he will have $4 - $8 = -$4 left. Then his friend gives him $5, so now he has $5 + (-$4) = $1. So, he has $1 left.
"Response:  If O Dan had $3 after buying a chocolate and he had $4 at the beginning, then we can write an equation as follows:

$4 - $3 = cost of chocolate

Now, we need to solve for the value of ""cost of chocolate"". We know that $4 is the total amount of money O Dan had initially, so if he spent $3 on something else (the chocolate), then he has $1 left ($4 - $3). Therefore, the cost of the chocolate is equal to $1.

So, the answer is: The chocolate cost $1."
Response:  If O Dan spent $3 on chocolates and each bar of chocolate costs $1, then he has $3 - $3 = $0 left. So, there is no money left after buying the chocolates.
Response:  If O Dan has $3 and spends a total of $4, he must have bought something that cost $1 more than $3. So, each bar of chocolate costs $1.
Response:  The total amount of money spent by O Dan is $5 + $3 = $8. He spent $8 to buy one bar of chocolate and $8 to buy another bar of chocolate. So, he spent more money buying the second bar of chocolate than he did buying the first bar of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is $8 - $7 = $1.
Response:  The total amount of money spent by O Dan is $4 + $7 + $2 = $13. So he spent more money on chocolate than on potatoes. Therefore, the difference between the amount spent on chocolate and potatoes is $13 - $7 = $6.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 115 books and he sold 78 of them at the garage sale. So, we can say that he has 37 books left with him (115 - 78 = 37).
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books at a garage sale, there were 105 left. So, if Paul had initially x books, we can write an equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 205
So, Paul had 205 books in total when he started."
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale and giving some to his friend, he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left with Paul

In this case, the total number of books is 108, and the number of books left with Paul is 62, so we can plug these values into the equation:

Number of books sold = 108 - 62
= 46

Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books. Then he bought some more at a garage sale, which increased his total number of books to 151. So, we can say that Paul bought x new books where x is equal to 101 (the difference between 50 and 151). Therefore, the answer is 101.
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had two books (he had ""two books""). Then he sold some of them at a garage sale and bought 150 new ones. So now he has 58 books in total. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of old books from the total number of books he has now: 58 - 2 = 56. Therefore, Paul sold 56 books at the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. Then he bought 42 new books. So, his current number of books is:

Paul's initial books = 21
Books sold at garage sale =? (we don't know)
New books purchased = 42
Total number of books now = Initial books + Books sold - New books purchased
= 21 +? - 42
= 15
Therefore, Paul sold 36 more books than he purchased."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them to raise money for his trip. Let's assume he sold x books. Now, he bought 38 new books, so he has 71 + 38 = 109 books now. Since he sold some books, we can say that he bought more books than he sold. So, the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold is equal to the total number of books he has now minus the number of books he had initially. Therefore, the answer is:

More books bought = Total books now - Initial books
= 109 - 71
= 38
Paul bought 38 more books than he sold."
"Response:  We know that initially Paul had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of books Paul sold at the garage sale.

We know that the total number of books Paul had initially was 108, so the number of books he didn't sell is:

108 - x = 66

Now, we also know that the total number of pens Paul had initially was 55, so the number of pens he didn't sell is:

55 - x = 59

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 42

So, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some books and pens at a garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So, he sold x pens at the garage sale. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 51 + x = 82 (books) and 106 - x = 14 (pens). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 32. So, Paul sold 32 pens at the garage sale.
"Response:  If Paul had initially 136 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he has fewer books now than he did before. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of books Paul has after selling = Number of books Paul had before - Number of books sold

We know that Paul had 136 books initially, so let's call this value x. We also know that he sold some books at the garage sale, but we don't know how many. Let's assume that he sold 27 books. Now, we can substitute these values into our equation to solve for x:

x - 27 = 109

Now, we need to isolate the variable x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -27:

x = 109 / -27

x = 4

So, Paul had 136 books initially (x), and he sold 27 books at the garage sale, leaving him with 4 books."
Response:  We know that after giving some books to an friend and selling others in a garage sale, Paulo had 68 books left. So, we can write an equation: 134 - 39 = 68. Now, let's solve for the number of books sold at the garage sale: 39 = x. Therefore, Paulo sold 39 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 95 canets and 153 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 canets left. So, we need to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can use the information that he started with 153 books and ended up with 13 books. Therefore, he sold 140 books (153 - 13 = 140) at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 42 canetas and 143 books. After selling some of them in a garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 canetas left. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 42 + x = 113 (where x is the number of canetas sold) Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 42 from both sides of the equation: x = 71 This means that Paul sold 71 canetas at the garage sale.
Response:  If there were initially 10 roses in the vase and Jessica cut 8 more from her garden and added them to the vase, then there are now 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  If there were some roses in the vase initially and Jessica cut 16 more from her garden and placed them in the vase, then the total number of roses in the vase is equal to the initial number plus the additional ones she brought. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of roses in the vase = Initial number + Number of new roses. In this case, the initial number of roses was 0 (since there were already some roses in the vase), and the number of new roses was 16. Therefore, the final number of roses in the vase is: Number of roses in the vase = 0 + 16 = 16. So, there were 16 roses in the vase at the beginning.
Response:  At first, there were two roses in the vase. Then, Jessica took four roses out of the vase and cut some new roses from her flower garden to put into the vase. So, now there are 23 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of roses she took out (4) from the total number of roses in the vase after she added new ones (23). Therefore, Jessica cut 19 roses.
"Response: 
Jessica took out 33 roses from the vase and cut some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now there are 17 roses in the vase. So, she cut more roses than she took out. The difference between the number of roses she took out (33) and the number she cut (more than 17) is equal to the total number of roses in the vase after she added the new ones (17). Therefore, the answer is 16."
"Response:  
Jessica had 21 roses in the vase initially. 
She took out 34 roses from the vase and cut some new roses from her flower garden to put into the vase. Now there are 15 roses left in the vase. 
So, she threw away more roses than she cut from her garden. Therefore, the difference between the number of roses thrown away and the number of roses cut is equal to the initial number of roses in the vase minus the final number of roses in the vase. 
Mathematically, we can write this as:
Difference = Initial Number - Final Number
= 21 - 15
= 6
Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 roses more than she cut from her garden."
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica cut more roses from her flower garden, which had a total of 59 roses. So, if we subtract the number of roses in the vase (7) from the total number of roses in the garden (59), we get 52. Therefore, Jessica cut 52 roses from her garden.
"Response:  If there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut more from her flower garden that had a total of 12 roses, then the number of roses in the vase after she cut them is:

New roses in the vase = Initial roses in the vase - Roses cut from the garden
= 13 -?

We are given that there are now 21 roses in the vase, so we can set up an equation:

New roses in the vase = Total roses in the garden - Roses cut for the vase
= 12 +?

Solving for? (the number of roses left in the garden), we get:

? = New roses in the vase - Total roses in the garden
= 21 - 12
= 9

Therefore, there are 9 roses left in Jessica's flower garden."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. If Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden, then now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses (15) from the new number of roses (17):

17 - 15 = 2

Therefore, Jessica cut 2 roses from her garden."
Response:  If there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase, then after Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, Jessica cut 2 orchids from her garden.
Response:  At first, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. So, we can say that there are 7 more roses than orchids in the vase now (12 - 2 = 7).
Response:  At first, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  If Jessica had initially 3 roses in her flower pot and she cut some from her garden to put into the vase, then she must have cut x number of roses. Since there are now 19 roses in the vase, we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 19. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic.
Response:  We know that initially there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. If Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden, then now there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of roses before (13) from the number of roses after (14). Therefore, Jessica cut 9 roses.
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. If Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden, then now there are 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, Jessica cut 9 roses (16 - 13 = 9) and 2 orchids (3 - 7 = -2).
Response:  At first, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, there are 22 - 6 = 16 more roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  At first, there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So, the number of orchids more than roses in the vase is 10 (13 - 3).
Response:  If Robin had 17 inches of hair and she cut some centimeters off, then her new length is 13 inches. To find out how many centimeters she cut off, we can divide the difference between the original and new lengths by the number of inches in an inch (which is 2.54 cm/inch). So, if 17 - 13 = 4 inches, then she cut off 4 x 2.54 = 10.16 cm of hair.
Response:  Before cutting her hair, Rachel had 30 cm of hair (since she cut off 20 cm). Now, after cutting, she has 15 cm of hair. So, before cutting, Rachel had 30 - 20 = 10 cm of hair.
Response:  The hair of Robin was initially 16 inches long (or 40 cm). Then she cut it by 15 cm, which is equal to 6 inches. So now her hair is 10 inches long (or 25 cm). After that, she said that her hair grew back 12 inches, which is equal to 30 cm. Therefore, her current length of hair is 30 + 25 = 55 cm or 21.6 inches.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long, and it grew an additional 18 inches, then her hair is now 37 inches long (19 + 18 = 37).
"Response:  If the robin cut 30 cm off her hair and initially it had 14 polegades of length, then we can calculate how much it has now as follows:

Length after cutting = Initial length - Cutting (in cm)
= 14 polegadas x 30 cm / 1 polegada
= 420 cm

So, the woman's hair is now 420 cm long."
Response:  The hair of Robin grew 8 inches (polegadas) and then he cut off 20 inches. So, after cutting, his hair is shorter than before by 20 - 8 = 12 inches. Therefore, the length of Robin's hair now is 45 - 12 = 33 inches or 33 cm.
Response:  We know that O Danny has 12 bottle caps in his collection initially. Then he found 53 more bottle caps in the park. So, now he has 12 + 53 = 65 bottle caps in total.
Response:  If O Danny has 21 tampas of garrafas in his collection and he found more tampas of garrafas in the park, then the total number of tampas of garrafas he has now is 21 + X, where X is the number of tampas of garrafas he found in the park. So, the answer is 21 + X = 53. Therefore, O Danny found 32 tampas of garrafas in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 63 tamps of bottle caps while he was playing at the park and then found 51 old ones. So, his collection now has 33 taps of bottle caps. To find out how many taps Danny had at the beginning, we need to subtract the number of old taps (51) from the total number of taps he found (63). Therefore, Danny had 12 taps of bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 tamps of bottles in the park and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 new tamps of bottles now. To find out how many more tamps he found than he threw away, we need to subtract the number of tamps he threw away from the total number of tamps he found: 22 - 35 = 13. Therefore, Danny found 13 more tamps of bottles in the park than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 tamps of bottles in the park and now he has 42 tanks in his collection. So, he must have thrown away 63 - 30 = 33 bottles. Therefore, Danny threw away more bottles than he found in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 0 tampas and 0 embalagens (since he found them later). Then, he found 22 tampas and 8 embalagens, so now he has 22 + 0 = 22 tampas and 8 + 8 = 16 embalagens. After that, he collected more tampas and embalagens, so his total number of tampas is now 28 and his total number of embalagens is 63. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 0 tampas and 0 embalagens.
Response:  At first, Danny had 30 embalagens and 22 tampas of bottles. Now he has 17 tampos of bottles and 57 embalagens. So, initially, Danny had 30 - 17 = 13 embalagens.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 30 tampas and 14 embalagens in his collection. Then he found more tampas and embalagens in the park, so now he has 7 tampas and 86 embalagens in his collection. To find out how many more tampas than embalagens Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of embalagens from the number of tampas: 7 - 86 = -79. So, Danny found -79 more embalagens than tampas in the park.
"Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 11 tamps and 28 emballages in his collection. Now he has 68 tamps and 51 emballages. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Tamps = Initial Tamps + Number of Tamps Found
Emballages = Initial Emballages + Number of Emballages Found

Now, let's find out how many more emballages than tamps Danny found in the park:

Number of More Emballages = Total number of emballages found - Total number of tamps found
= 51 - 11
= 40

Therefore, Danny found 40 more emballages than tamps in the park."
Response:  At first, Danny found 71 tampas and 24 embalagens in the park. So he had 95 items (tampas + embalagens) in his collection initially. Then, he collected 28 more tampas and 16 more embalagens. Therefore, now he has 103 items (tampas + embalagens) in his collection. Since we know that there are more tampas than embalagens, Danny must have more tampas than embalagens in his collection right now. The difference between the number of tampas and embalagens is equal to the total number of tampas he collected minus the total number of embalagens he collected. In this case, the difference is 28 - 16 = 12. So, Danny has 12 more tampas than embalagens in his collection right now.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 tampas and 62 embalagens in the park. So he collected 27 more tampas and 43 more embalagens to his collection. Therefore, now he has 27 + 10 = 37 tampas and 43 + 62 = 105 embalagens. So, Danny has 105 - 10 = 95 embalagens more than the number of tampas he has.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 tamps of bottles in the park and now he has 25 tanks of bottles in his collection. So, if he had x tanks of bottles at the beginning, then after losing 66 tanks, he would have x - 66 tanks. Since he now has 25 tanks, we can set up the equation: x - 66 = 25. Solving for x, we get x = 92. Therefore, Danny had 92 tanks of bottles at the beginning.
Response:  If Danny had 25 bottle caps in his collection before finding some more in the park, then he found x bottle caps in the park. Since he now has 32 bottle caps in total, we can write an equation: 25 + x = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, Danny found 7 bottle caps in the park after having 25 in his collection already.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 60 old bottles in the park and found 58 new bottles while he was there. So, his collection now has 67 bottles. To find out how many bottles Danny had at the beginning, we need to subtract the number of bottles he already had (60) from the total number of bottles he has now (67): 67 - 60 = 7. Therefore, Danny had 7 bottles at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 50 new capsules and threw away 6 old ones. So he has 50 - 6 = 44 new capsules in his collection now. Since he found more than he threw away, we can say that he found 44 + X = 60 where X is the number of additional capsules he found. Therefore, X = 16. So Danny found 16 more capsules than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 48 new bottle caps and threw away 54 old ones in the park. So he gained 48 - 54 = -7 bottle caps. Therefore, he has now 52 - 7 = 45 bottle caps in his collection.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 0 tampas and 0 embalagens (since he found them later). Then, he found 82 embalagens and 29 tampas of garrafas in the park. So, now he has 42 tampas + 61 embalagens = 103 items in his collection. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 0 tampas.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 66 embalages and found 39 more in the park. So he now has 66 + 39 = 105 embalages. Then, we are told that he collected 16 additional tampos of bottles, so he now has 105 embalages and 16 tampos = 121 objects in his collection. Therefore, Danny had 66 embalages at the beginning.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 46 embalages and 50 tampas in his collection from the park. Then he found 21 more tampos of bottles and 52 additional embalages. So, now he has 73 (46 + 21) embalages and 102 (50 + 52) tampas in his collection. To find out how many more tampas than embalages Danny found at the park, we need to subtract the number of embalages he already had from the total number of tampas he found: 102 - 73 = 29. Therefore, Danny found 29 more tampas than embalages at the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 65 embalages and 5 tampas of garrafas in his collection. Then he found more emballages and tampos in the park, so now he has 31 tampas and 9 embalagens in his collection. To find out how many more emballages than tampas Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of tampas from the number of embalagens: 9 - 31 = -22. So, Danny found 22 more embalages than tampas in the park.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 58 tampas and 25 embalagens in the park. So he had a total of 58 + 25 = 83 items. Now we are told that he has 11 embalagens and 12 tampas left after collecting them from the park. Therefore, the number of tampas Danny has now is 12 - 58 = -46 fewer than the initial number of embalagens he had. In other words, Danny has 11 - (-46) = 57 more embalagens than tampas he has now.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 15 tampas and 18 embalagens in the park. So he started with 15 + 18 = 33 items. Now we are told that after collecting more items from the park, he has 67 embalagens and 35 tampas. Therefore, the difference between the number of embalagens and tampas is: 67 - 35 = 32 embalagens. So, Danny now has 33 (initial collection) + 32 = 65 items in his collection.
Response:  If Jake has 11 pears less than Steve, and Jake has 17 pears in total, then Steve must have 17 + 11 = 28 pears. So, Steve has 28 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 pears less than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 7 pears. Also, we know that Steven has 15 pears and Jake has x - 7 pears. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x - 7) = 15... (1) Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting 7 from both sides of Equation (1), we get: x = 8... (2) So, according to the question, Jake has 8 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 pessogs less than Steven. So if Steven has x pessogs, then Jake has x - 18 pessogs. Since Steven has 19 pessogs, we can set up the equation: Jake has x - 18 = 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. Therefore, Jill has 27 pessogs.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less peanuts than Steven and Steven has 8 more peanuts than Jill. So, if we subtract 3 from the number of peanuts Steven has (8), we get the number of peanuts Jake has: 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, Jake has 5 more peanuts than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 pears less than Steven and Steven has 11 pears more than Jill. So, if we subtract 11 from 12, we get -1 = 11 (Jill has 11 pears more than Jake). Therefore, Jill has 13 pears more than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 pears less than Steve and 9 pears more than Jill. So, if Steve has 16 pears, then Jake has:
Jake = Steve - (7 + 9) = 16 - 16 = 0 pears
Therefore, Jake has 0 pears."
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 peas less than Steve and 8 peas more than Jill. So, if Steve has 17 peas, then Jake has 10 (7 - 3) peas. Now, we know that Jill has 8 peas more than Jake, so she has 10 + 8 = 18 peas. Therefore, Jill has 18 peas.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake has 9 less peas than Steve and 18 more peas than Jill. So, if we assume that Jake has x peas, then Steve has x + 9 peas and Jill has x - 18 peas. Since Steve has 16 peas, we can set up the equation: x + 9 = 16... (1) Now, solve for x using substitution or elimination method.
Response:  We know that Jake has six less peanuts than Steven and Steven has 18 more peanuts than Jill. So, if Jill has 5 peanuts, then Jake must have... (6 - 5 =) 1 peanut.
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 pêssegos less than Steven and Steven has 18 pêssegos more than Jill. So, if Jill has 87 pêssegos, then Jake has 87 - 5 = 82 pêssegos.
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has 16 pears less than Steven.
Steven has 15 pears more than Jill.
Jill has 12 pears.
Now we can calculate how many pears Jill has compared to Jake:
Jill - Jake = (15 + 12) - 16 = 7
So Jill has 7 more pears than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 79 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 12 peaches. Also, we know that Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has x - 12 peaches, so we can set up the equation:
x = 19 + (x - 12)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 31
So, Jake has 31 peaches."
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 peaches less than Steve and 3 apples more than Steve. So, if Steve has 9 peaches and 8 apples, then Jake must have 9 + 3 = 12 apples. Therefore, Jake has 12 apples.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, O Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steve and 8 more apples than Jake. So, if we assume that Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 6 = 2x apples. Also, according to the problem statement, Jake has 8 more apples than he does pears, so Jake has 2x + 8 = 2x + 8 apples in total. Now, we are told that Steve has 17 apples and 16 maçãs (which is Portuguese for ""apples""). Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2x + 8 = 17 - 16. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Steve has 9 apples and 7 maçãs."
Response:  According to the problem statement, O Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steve and 10 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x peaches and y apples, then Jake has 3x - 10y peaches and y apples. We know that Steve has 12 peaches and 15 apples, so we can set up the equation: 3x - 10y = 12 and y = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 18. Therefore, Steve has 18 more apples than peaches.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 pêssegos and Jake has 4 less than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 pêssegos. Therefore, Jake has 8 pêssegos.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 pêssegos and Jake has 12 pêssegos less than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from 18, we get 6. Therefore, Jill has 6 pêssegos.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 pêssegos and Jake has x pêssegos less than Steven. So, Jake has 19 - x pêssegos. Also, we know that Jake has 72 pêssegos more than Jill. So, Jill has y pêssegos fewer than Jake. Therefore, we can write an equation: 19 = x + 72 - y. Solving for x, we get x = 13. So, Jake has 13 pêssegos less than Steven.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 peas and Jake has 6 fewer than Steven. So, Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peas. Now we are told that Jake has 3 more peas than Jill. Therefore, Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 peas.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more maçãs than Steven. So, if Steven has x pêssegos and maçãs, then Jake has x + 84 pêssegos and maçãs. Since Jake has fewer pêssegos than Steven, we can say that Jake has less than or equal to 10 pêssegos less than Steven. Therefore, the number of pêssegos Jake has is between 10 and 13 (inclusive). So, the answer is between 10 and 13 pêssegos.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more maçãs than Steven. So, if Steven has x maçãs, then Jake has 13 + x maçãs. Also, we know that Jake has 17 fewer pêssegos than Steven. So, if Steven has y pêssegos, then Jake has 17 - y pêssegos. Now, we are given that Jake has 45 pêssegos. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 17 - y = 45. Solving for y, we get y = 6. So, Jake has 13 + x = 45, or x = 32 maçãs.
Response:  According to the problem statement, O Jake has 8 fewer apples than Steve and 10 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 8 = 2x apples. Also, we know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steve, so Jake has 2x + 10 = 3x apples. Now, we are asked how many more apples than maize Jake has. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = 18 (since Jake has 18 maizes). Solving for x, we get x = 6. So, Steve has 6 more apples than maize.
Response:  According to the problem statement, O Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steve and 4 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and y peaches, then Jake has 3 less than that, which means he has x - 3 = 27 apples and y - 3 = 16 peaches. Since Steve has 19 apples and 15 peaches, we can set up the equation: x + y = 19 (apples) and x + y - 3 = 16 (peaches). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 10 and y = 8. Therefore, Steve has 10 more apples than peaches.
Response:  The total amount of money that Olivia had was $78. She spent $15 at the supermarket, so now she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.
"Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 initially, then we can calculate how much money she had left after buying the groceries as follows:

Initial amount = $33 (given)
Amount spent = $78 (given)
New amount = Initial amount - Amount spent
= $33 - $78
= -$45

So, Olivia had $-45 after buying the groceries."
Response:  If she had $100 in her wallet and then got $148 from an ATM, that means she now has $248 ($100 + $148). Then, after buying something at the store, she had $159 left. So, she spent $161 ($248 - $159) to buy something at the store.
Response:  If she had $3 in her wallet and then withdrew $49 from an ATM, that means she now has $52 ($3 + $49). Then, after buying something at the store, she had $49 left. So, she spent $3 at the store.
"Response:  
Olivia had $53 in her wallet and then withdrew $91 from an ATM. After that, she went to the store and spent $14. So, if we subtract what she spent at the store from what she withdrew, we get:
$91 - $14 = $77
Therefore, Olivia spent more money at the store than she withdrew from the ATM."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her wallet and after visiting a store she spent $26. So, now she has $70 left ($106 - $26 = $70). Then, she went to another store where she spent $49. Now, she has $21 left ($70 - $49 = $21). Therefore, she spent $49 at the second store.
Response:  After Olivia went to the store and spent $29, she had $54 in her wallet initially. So, she spent $29 - $54 = $-25.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone. So, he still has 14 applications on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had n applications on his phone at first and he deleted 18 of them, then he has (n - 18) applications left. Since there are only 5 applications remaining after deleting all 18, we can set up an equation: (n - 18) = 5. Solving for n, we get: n = 23. So, Dave had 23 applications on his phone at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones. So, in total, he had 21 applications (10 + 11 = 21). Now, after deleting some of them, he was left with only four applications. Therefore, the number of applications he deleted is equal to 21 - 4 = 17.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and then added 89 new ones. So, the total number of applications he had after adding both sets is:

21 + 89 = 106

Now, we are asked how many applications Dave removed. The question states that after removing some, there were 24 applications left. Therefore, the difference between the total number of applications Dave had after adding both sets and the number of applications he removed is:

106 - 24 = 82

So, Dave added more applications than he removed by 82 applications."
"Response: 
Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially. He added 71 new applications, so he now has $15 + 71 = 86$ applications on his phone.
Then, he deleted some applications, leaving him with $86 - x$, where $x$ is the number of applications he deleted. Since he had 14 applications left after deleting some, we can set up the equation:
$$86 - x = 14$$
Now, solve for $x$:
$$x = 72$$
So, Dave deleted 72 applications from his phone. Therefore, the difference between the number of applications he added ($71$) and the number he deleted ($72$) is:
$$71 - 72 = -1$$
Therefore, Dave apagou um aplicação mais do que adicionou."
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files in his phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files in his phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 14 applications (17 - 3 = 14) and 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, the number of applications Dave has more than the number of files is:

Applications - Files = 21 - 4 = 17

Therefore, Dave has 17 more applications than files on his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. This means that he deleted 3 applications and 2 files. So, now he has 6 applications and 17 files (15 + 2) on his phone. Therefore, he has more files than applications on his phone.
Response:  After Dave had 17 applications on his phone and he added some more, he had 18 applications in total. So, he must have added 1 application to reach 18 from 17.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 59 files and 15 applications on his phone. If he deleted some apps and files, then he had 12 applications and 30 files left. To find out how many applications Dave deleted, we can divide the number of initial applications (15) by the number of remaining applications (12). So, Dave deleted 3 applications.
Response:  We know that initially Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 7 apps (24 - 17 = 7) and 9 files (21 - 21 = 0). Therefore, Dave deleted 7 + 9 = 16 files and apps.
"Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of applications more than files that Dave has on his phone is:

12 - 5 = 7

Therefore, Dave has 7 more applications than files on his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, we can say that he deleted 9 applications (11 - 2 = 9) and 1 file (3 - 2 = 1). Therefore, he has more files than applications in his mobile phone now. The number of files he has is 24, and the number of applications he has is 2.
Response:  If Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So, Nell still has 106 cards.
Response:  If Nell had 301 cards initially and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has none left. So, her initial number of cards was 301.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252). Therefore, the answer is 276.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now, let's say x. Then, we are told that she gave Jeff some of her cards, so he has y cards now. Since she gave him some of her cards, y < x. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information: x - y = 535 (since Nell has 535 cards left after giving some to Jeff). Solving for y, we get y = 198 (since x - y = 535). Therefore, Jeff has 198 cards now.
Response:  According to the problem, Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Then she got more baseball cards from him, which brought her total number of baseball cards to 415. Also, she has 149 ten-card packs. So, the difference between the number of baseball cards Nell has now (415) and the number of baseball cards she had before giving some to Jeff (309) is 106. Therefore, Nell has 106 more baseball cards than she did before.
"Response:  According to the question, Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card sets. So, the number of ten-card sets that Nell got from Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of baseball cards and her current number of baseball cards minus the number of baseball cards she gave to Jeff.
Let X be the number of ten-card sets that Nell got from Jeff. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
X = 404 - 246 + 495 = 355
Therefore, Nell has 355 ten-card sets more than the number of baseball cards she originally had."
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave some to both John and Jeff. After giving some to John, she has 210 cards left. So, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is equal to the total number of cards she had minus the number of cards she gave to John. Therefore, the answer is: Number of cards Nell gave to Jeff = 573 - 195 = 378.
Response:  According to the problem, Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has 55 ten-card sets and 178 baseball cards. So, the total number of baseball cards that Nell has is 178 + 55 = 233. Therefore, Nell has more than 10 baseball cards. The exact difference between the number of baseball cards Nell has and 10 is 233 - 10 = 223.
Response:  According to the question, Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has 376 ten-card sets and 111 baseball cards. So, the number of ten-card sets Nell got from Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of baseball cards (239) and her current total number of both types of cards (496). Therefore, the number of ten-card sets Nell got from Jeff is 239 - 496 = -257. Since it can't be negative, we know that Nell got no ten-card sets from Jeff.
Response:  If Paco had 19 bolinhos and gave 35 to his friends, then he must have started with some number of biscuits that is divisible by 35 (since he gave away 35). So, if we divide 100 (the total number of biscuits) by 35, we get 3. Therefore, Paco started with 3 biscuits.
Response:  If Paco came with 28 bolachas and he ate some of them, then he has 7 biscuits left. So, we can say that Paco ate x number of bolachas (where x is the difference between 28 and 7). Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  Paco had 40 bolachas initially and he ate two of them. So, he has 40 - 2 = 38 bolachas left. Then, he bought more 37 bolachas. Now, he has 38 + 37 = 75 bolachas in total. Therefore, there are 75 bolachas remaining for Paco.
"Response: 
Paco came with 25 cookies and ate 5 of them. So he had 20 left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought more 3 biscuits. So now he has 20 + 3 = 23 biscuits in total.
So, the answer is 23."
Response:  Paco came with 13 cookies and he ate two of them. So, he had 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he bought more than 36 biscuits (not just 36). Therefore, the number of biscuits he bought is greater than 11. We can conclude that he bought 37 or more biscuits.
Response:  If Paco came with 40 cookies and he ate 5 of them, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. He gave his friend 13 of those cookies, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, Paco still has 22 cookies.
Response:  If Paco came with 17 bolaches and he ate 14 of them, then he has 17 - 14 = 3 bolaches left. Now, if he gave 13 to his friend, then he has 3 - 13 = -10 bolaches left (negative because we are counting backwards). So, Paco more came than he gave away.
Response:  If Paco came with 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them, then he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. He gave his friend 21 cookies, so he gave him more than he had (-4). So, the answer is +4 cookies.
Response:  At first, Paco had 22 + 75 = 97 bolachas (doces and salty). Then he ate 15 of his doce bolachas, leaving him with 97 - 15 = 82 doce bolachas still left. Finally, he ate 54 of his salty bolachas, so now he has 82 - 54 = 28 dose bolachas remaining. Therefore, Paco still has 28 doce bolachas.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 6 salted crackers and 9 sweet crackers. Then he ate 36 sweet crackers and 3 salty crackers. So, if we subtract the number of crackers he ate from the initial amount, we get: Salted crackers left = Initially had - Ate = 6 - 36 = -30 Salted crackers left = -30 Therefore, Paco still has 6 salted crackers left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 37 bolachas doces and 11 salgadas initially. He then ate 5 biscoitos doces and 2 biscoitos salgados. So, he has 37 + 5 = 42 bolachas doces left after eating the biscuits. On the other hand, he has only 11 salgadas remaining after eating them. Therefore, the number of biscoitos doces that Paco ate more than the salgados is 42 - 11 = 31.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 8 sweet and 6 savory biscuits. He then ate 20 sweet biscuits and 34 savory biscuits. So, in total, he ate 50 biscuits (20 + 34). Now, we need to find out how many more savory than sweet biscuits he ate. To do this, we can subtract the number of sweet biscuits he ate from the number of savory biscuits he ate: 34 - 20 = 14. Therefore, Paco ate 14 more savory biscuits than sweet biscuits.
Response:  If Paco had 37 cookies initially and he gave 36 of them away, then he has 1 cookie left. So, Paco has 1 cookie.
Response:  If Paco came with 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend, then he has 22 (36 - 14) cookies left.
Response:  If Paco came with 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend, then he had 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. He ate 18 of them, so he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate more cookies than he gave to his friend.
Response:  If Paco gave his friend six cookies and he gave three times as many to his friend than he ate himself, then... (1) He ate 6 + 3 = 9 cookies. (2) He gave his friend 3 x 9 = 27 cookies. So, the difference between the number of cookies he gave his friend and the number he ate is 27 - 9 = 18 cookies. Therefore, he gave his friend 18 more cookies than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 97 bolachas salgadas and 34 doces. If he consumed 15 bolachas doces, then he has fewer doces now. So, the number of doces Paco still has is: 34 - 15 = 19.
Response:  The total number of biscuits that Paco had is equal to the sum of the number of salty and sweet biscuits he had initially: 26 + 17 = 43. Since Paco ate 14 sweet biscuits, he has 43 - 14 = 29 biscuits left. Therefore, Paco still has 29 salty biscuits.
Response:  We know that initially, Paco had 39 total biscuits (39 = 39 doce + 0 salgado). Then he ate 23 of them were salty and 32 sweet. So now he has 39 - 23 = 16 left. And among these remaining ones, 32 are sweet, so he ate more sweet than salted.
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 doce and 25 salted bolachas initially. He consumed 28 salted biscuits and 15 sweets. So he has 40 - 28 = 12 left of sweet biscuits and 25 - 15 = 10 left of salted biscuits. Therefore, he consumed more salted than sweet biscuits. The difference between the number of salted and sweet biscuits he consumed is 10 - 12 = -2.
Response:  If Gwen received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent $2 ($7 - $5 = $2).
Response:  If Gwen received $X dollars for her birthday and spent $8 of it, then she has $X - $8 = $6 left. So, Gwen received $6 + $8 = $14 dollars in total.
Response:  If she received $2 from her mom and her dad gave her $4 more, then she has a total of $6 ($2 + $4). If she spent $3, then she would have $3 left. So, the answer is $3.
Response:  If Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father, then she has a total of $13 ($8 + $5). If she spent $4, that means she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Gwen received more money from her mother than from her father. The difference between the amount she received from her mother and her father is $9 - $5 = $4.
Response:  If Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, then she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, that means she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. So, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother did. The difference between the amount given by the father and the mother is $6 (the amount the father gave) - $3 (the amount the mother gave), which is equal to $3. Therefore, Gwen's father gave her $3 more than her mother did.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and then her mother gave her $7 more, so in total she got $12 ($5 + $7). Now, if she spent $4, then she has $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her mother is $8 - $5 = $3 more than the amount she received from her father.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, then she has a total of $7 (5 + 2). If she spent $6, that means she has $1 left ($7 - 6 = $1). So, Gwen received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 balls in his collection and he lost some of them, then he has fewer than 9 balls now. We are not told how many balls he lost, but we know that he has 4 balls left. So, he must have lost 5 balls (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had x bolas in his collection and lost 21 bolas, then he has x - 21 bolas left. Since he now has 12 balls, we can set up an equation: x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. So, Josh had 33 bolas in his collection before losing any.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 bolas in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 remaining bolas. After that, he found 5 new ones, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 bolas in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 13 bolas in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had 4 balls in his collection and he lost 16 balls, then he had 4 - 16 = -12 balls left. But if he found 8 new balls, then he has 8 + (-12) = 6 balls now. So, he lost more balls than he found.
Response:  If Josh had 7 bolas in his collection and lost 8 of them, then he had 7 - 8 = -1 bolas left. Then, if he found 10 new bolas, that means he gained 10 + (-1) = 9 new bolas. So, he found more bolas than he lost. The difference between the number of bolas he found and the number he lost is 9.
Response:  If Josh had 21 balls in his collection and he found 7 more balls, then he has 21 + 7 = 28 balls now.
Response:  Josh had 20 balls in his collection and gave two to Jack. So now he has 20 - 2 = 18 balls left.
Response:  The Josh had 22 balls in his collection initially. Then, Jack gave him 20 balls. So, now he has 22 + 20 = 42 balls in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 19 balls in his collection before and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8).
"Response:  At first, Josh had 22 balls in his collection. Then he found 13 more balls of the same type while losing 5 balls. So, the total number of balls he has now is:

22 + 13 = 35

Therefore, Josh has 35 balls in his collection now."
Response:  If Josh had 15 balls in his collection and found 9 more, then he has a total of 15 + 9 = 24 balls now. However, if he lost 23 balls, then he actually has 24 - 23 = 1 ball left in his collection. So, Josh lost more balls than he found.
"Response:  We know that Josh had 3 balls in his collection initially and then he found 6 more while losing 5. So, the total number of balls he has now is:
3 + 6 = 9
So, he found 9 balls more than the ones he lost."
Response:  The total weight of the mangoes caught by both Marco and his father is given as 9 kg (4 + 5). Since Marco caught more mangoes than his father, the weight of the mangoes he caught must be greater than the weight of the mangoes his father caught. So, the difference between the weight of the mangoes caught by Marco and those caught by his father is equal to the weight of the mangoes caught by Marco. Therefore, the weight of the mangoes caught by Marco is 6 kg (9 - 3 = 6).
Response:  The total weight of the mangoes caught by Marco and his father is 35 kg. If we subtract the weight of the mangoes caught by Marco (5 kg), then the remaining weight must be equal to the weight of the mangoes caught by his father. So, the weight of the mangoes caught by his father is 30 kg (35 - 5). Therefore, the weight of the mangoes caught by his father is 30 kg more than the weight of the mangoes caught by Marco.
Response:  The total weight of the marco and his father's mangoes is 20 kg. So, if the father's mangoes weigh 5 kg, then the weight of Marco's mangoes must be equal to 20 - 5 = 15 kg. Therefore, the weight of Marco's mangoes is 15 kg.
Response:  The son and his father caught mangoes that weighed 8 kg and 32 kg together, respectively. So, if they caught x kg of mangoes in total, then the weight of each mango caught by the son would be 8/x kg, and the weight of each mango caught by the father would be 32 - 8/x kg. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies both these equations simultaneously. We can solve this problem using algebraic manipulation or substitution method. After simplifying, we get x = 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of mangoes caught by the son and his father is 8 + 32 = 40 kg.
Response:  The father and son together collected mangoes that weighed more than 7 kilograms. On their way back, Marco lost 3 kilograms of mangoes. So, the weight of Marco's remaining mangoes is 3 kilograms. Now, we need to find out how much did the father's mangoes weigh initially. Since the total weight of mangoes collected by both was more than 7 kilograms, and Marco lost 3 kilograms, it means that the father's initial share of mangoes must have been at least 7 kilograms minus 3 kilograms, which is equal to 4 kilograms. Therefore, the weight of the father's mangoes was 4 kilograms.
Response:  The father and son together collected 10 kg of mangoes. On their way back, the father lost 2 kg of mangoes. So, now the son has 5 kg of mangoes. To find out how much the father had initially, we can subtract the weight he lost from the total weight they collected: 10 kg - 2 kg = 8 kg. Therefore, the father had 8 kg of mangoes initially.
Response:  The father and son together collected 22 kilograms of mangoes. Then, the father found an additional 30 kilograms of mangoes. So, in total, they have 52 kilograms of mangoes (22 + 30). Now, let's calculate how much each person contributed to this amount. Since the father found more mangoes than the son, we can say that the father contributed x kilograms and the son contributed 22 kilograms. Therefore, the weight of the mangoes the father found is 30 - x kilograms.
Response:  The Marco and his father caught mangoes. The mangoes of Marco weighed 5 kg. If together their mangoes weigh 37 kg, then the weight of the mangoes of his father is equal to 37 - 5 = 32 kg. Therefore, the weight of the mangoes of his father is 32 kg.
Response:  The father and son together caught 50 kg of mangoes (Marko and his father caught 30 kg each). Since their combined weight is 17 kg less than the total weight of their mangoes, we can calculate that the weight of Marko's mangoes was 43 kg (17 kg - 30 kg = 43 kg). Therefore, the difference in weight between Marko's mangoes and his father's mangoes is 9 kg (43 kg - 30 kg = 9 kg).
Response:  The father and son together caught 26 kilograms of mangoes. If the weight of Marco's mangoes is x kilograms, then the weight of his father's mangoes is 5x kilograms. We are given that the total weight of their mangoes is equal to 26 kilograms. So, we can write an equation: x + 5x = 26. Simplifying the equation, we get 6x = 26. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 4. Therefore, the weight of Marco's mangoes is 4 kilograms, and the weight of his father's mangoes is 5 times that amount, or 20 kilograms.
Response:  The father of Marco caught 10 kg (5 kg x 2) of mangoes. Since together they weigh 30 kg, Marco must have caught 6 kg (30 - 10 = 6) of mangoes.
Response:  Before reaching the stop, there were two children in the car. Then more children entered the car at the stop, so now there are 10 children in the car altogether. To find out how many more children are in the car than before the stop, we need to subtract the original number of children from the current number: 10 - 2 = 8. So, there are 8 more children in the car now than there were before the stop.
Response:  The initial number of children in the bus was 26. Then, another 38 children entered the bus at the stop. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  Before reaching the bus stop, there were 3 children in the car. Then, two more children entered the bus. So, at the bus stop, there were 5 children (3 + 2) in the car. Therefore, before reaching the bus stop, there were 37 children (41 - 5) in the car.
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the stop. So, after they left, there were 21 children left in the bus. Now we want to find out how many children got off the bus at the stop. To do this, we can divide the number of children who remained in the bus (21) by the total number of children who were originally in the bus (43), which gives us a fraction of 0.5 or half. Therefore, half of the original number of children (i.e., 21/43 = 0.5) got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 41 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the stop. So, after they left, there were 18 children left in the bus. To find out how many more children were in the bus before than now, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. Therefore, the answer is: 23 (41 - 18).
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus while 5 more entered the bus. So, at this point, there are 16 children left inside the bus. Finally, we are asked how many children entered the bus at the stop. Since 5 children entered the bus and 10 children got off, the number of children who entered the bus is 5 - 10 = -5. Therefore, the answer is 5 children entered the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the car (the number of children who were already inside). Then, 63 children got off at the stop, leaving 14 children still inside the car. So, the difference between the number of children who entered and exited the car is 63 - 14 = 50. Therefore, 50 more children entered the car than left it.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and after some time, 68 children got off while others entered. So, the number of children who entered the bus is equal to the number of children who left it minus 36 = 68 - 36 = 32. Therefore, the number of children who left the bus more than they entered is 32.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more entered while some left. So, at this point, we have 62 children (22 + 40) inside the bus. Now, when 20 children left the bus, how many remained inside? Therefore, the number of children who left the bus is equal to the number of children who entered minus the number of children who remained inside. In other words, 40 - 62 = -22. Hence, there are -22 children who left the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus. Then, 82 children entered the bus while some left. So, the number of children who entered the bus is equal to the number of children who left (82 - 28 = 54). Therefore, the number of children who entered the bus more than those who left is 54.
Response:  At first, there were 23 children in the bus. Then, 24 children entered the bus while some left. So, the number of children in the bus increased to 47 (23 + 24). Now, we are told that there were 8 children in the bus who left more than they entered. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who entered and left is equal to 8. Hence, the number of children who left the bus is 8 - 8 = 0. So, none of the children left the bus.
"Response:  If the baker made 133 bolos and sold 51 of them, then he must have made more than the number of bolos he sold. So, the difference between the number of bolos he made and the number of bolos he sold is equal to the total number of bolos he made minus the number of bolos he sold. Therefore, the answer is:

Difference = Total number of bolos made - Number of bolos sold = 133 - 51 = 82

So, the baker made 82 bolos more than the ones he sold."
Response:  If the padeiro made 54 bolos and still has 13 left, that means he sold some of them. So, we can say that he sold x bolos. Now, we have to find out how many bolos the padeiro originally had. We know that the total number of bolos is equal to the number of bolos the padeiro made minus the number of bolos he sold. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 54 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 41. So, the padeiro sold 41 bolos.
Response:  The baker made 145 bolos and sold them all. So he still has 72 bolos left. To find out how many bolos the baker initially made, we can divide the number of bolos he still has (72) by the number of bolos he sold (145): 72 / 145 = x. Since x is a whole number, the baker initially made x bolos.
"Response:  The padeiro made 155 bolos in total. If his friend bought 140 of them, then the number of bolos left with the padeiro is:

155 - 140 = 15

So, the padeiro still has 15 bolos left."
Response:  The baker made 121 bolos and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) bolos left. Then, he bought 170 new bolos, so now he has 34 (16 + 170) bolos in total.
"Response:  The baker sold 91 bolos and bought 154 new ones. So, he bought more than he sold. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of bolos he sold from the number of bolos he bought:

154 - 91 = 63

So, the baker bought 63 more bolos than he sold."
Response:  The baker made 170 bread rolls and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). He also bought 31 new bread rolls. Therefore, the number of bread rolls that the baker sold is equal to the number of bread rolls he bought plus the number of bread rolls he had left. In other words, the difference between the total number of bread rolls he sold and the total number of bread rolls he bought. So we can write this as follows: Total Number Sold = Total Number Bought + Total Number Left. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total Number Sold = 31 + 92 = 123. Therefore, the baker sold 123 more bread rolls than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 bolos and sold 75 of them. So he still has 35 bolos left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, after making more 76 bolos, he now has a total of 35 + 76 = 111 bolos.
Response:  The baker made 144 bolos and sold 71 of them. Then he made more 111 bolos. So in total, he made 255 bolos (144 + 111). But he only sold 71 bolos. Therefore, he has 184 bolos left (255 - 71 = 184).
Response:  The baker made 149 bolos and 91 doces in total. If he sells 10 bolos, then he will have 139 bolos left (149 - 10 = 139). And if he sells 90 doces, then he will have 9 doces left (91 - 90 = 9). So, the baker still has 139 bolos and 9 doces.
Response:  The baker had 7 + 148 = 155 bolos initially. If he sold 15 bolos, then he has 155 - 15 = 140 bolos left. Finally, if he sold another 103 bolos, he would have 140 - 103 = 37 bolos remaining. Therefore, the baker still has 37 bolos.
Response:  The padeiro made 126 bolos and sold 115 of them. So he has 11 more bolos than he sold. Now, let's consider the doces. He made 48 doces and sold 81 of them. So he has 33 fewer doces than he sold. Therefore, the padeiro made more bolos than doces.
Response:  The baker made 19 bolos and 131 doces. If he sold 70 bolos, then he has left with 12 bolos (19 - 70 = 12). Now, if he also sold 88 more bolos, then he has sold a total of 208 bolos (88 + 12 = 208). So, the baker sold more bolos than he initially made.
"Response:  The baker made 157 bolos and 169 doces (a total of 326 pastries). If he sold 158 bolos and 147 doces (a total of 305 pastries), then we can calculate how many more bolos than doces were sold as follows:

Number of bolos sold = 158 - 147 = 11

So, the baker sold 11 more bolos than doces."
Response:  The padeiro sold 68 bolos and 92 doces, so it sold 92 - 54 = 38 more doces than bolos.
Response:  If he had made 48 buns initially and sold 44 of them, then he still has 4 (48 - 44 = 4).
"Response:  If the baker had initially made 40 bolos and sold 8 of them, then he must have made additional bolos to reach that number. So, the total number of bolos the baker made is:

Total bolos = Initial bolos + Additional bolos
= 40 + X

Since the baker sold 8 bolos, we can set up an equation based on this information:

X - 8 = Total bolos sold

Now, let's solve for X (the additional bolos made):

X = Total bolos sold + 8

Substituting the value given in the question:

X = 40 + 8
= 48

So, the baker made 48 bolos more than the initial 40 bolos."
Response:  If he had made 169 buns initially and sold 137 of them, then he still has 32 buns left (169 - 137 = 32).
Response:  The baker made 173 bolos and sold 86 of them. So he has 87 bolos left (173 - 86 = 87).
"Response:  The baker made 99 bolos and then bought 167 new ones. So he had a total of 266 bolos (99 + 167). Then, he sold 89 bolos. Therefore, the difference between the number of bolos he bought and the number he sold is:

266 - 89 = 177

So, the baker bought 177 more bolos than he sold."
Response:  The baker made 8 bolos and sold them. Then he bought 139 new bolos and sold 145 bolos in total. So, we need to find out how many more bolos the baker sold than he bought. To do this, subtract the number of bolos he bought from the number of bolos he sold: 145 - 139 = 6. Therefore, the baker sold 6 more bolos than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 62 bolos initially and then added another 149 bolos to make in total. He sold 144 of them, so he still has 15 (62 + 149 - 144) bolos left.
Response:  The baker made 81 bolos and then added more to make a total of 92 bolos. If he sold 46 of them, that means he has 46 + 81 = 127 bolos left. So, the baker made more bolos than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 61 + 167 = 228 bolos in total. If he sold 108 bolos and kept 44 bolos for himself, then he still has 44 bolos left with him.
Response:  The baker made 56 bolos and then sold 104 of them. This means that he still has 50 bolos left (56 - 104 = 50). Now, let's consider the doces. He sold 29 doces, so he must have had some doces initially. Let's assume he started with x doces. Then, we can write an equation: 50 + x = 124 (total number of bolos and doces) Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get: 50 + 29 = 124 Solving for x, we get: x = 75 So, the baker still has 75 doces left.
Response:  The baker made 52 + 84 = 136 bolos in total. If he sold 102 bolos and 94 bolos, then he has 136 - (102 + 94) = 40 bolos left. So, the baker has 40 more bolos than he originally made.
Response:  The padeiro made 134 bolos and then sold 140 bolos, so he made 6 more bolos than what he sold (140 - 134 = 6). Now, let's consider the doces. He sold 92 doces, which is less than the number of bolos he sold (140 - 92 = 48). So, the padeiro made 48 more doces than what he sold.
Response:  The baker made 14 + 153 = 167 bolos in total. If he sold 8 bolos and 97 bolos, then he has left with (167 - 8 - 97) = 72 bolos more than what he sold. So, there are 72 bolos more than what the baker sold.
Response:  The baker made 43 bolos and sold 154 bolos, so he sold 111 more bolos than he made (154 - 43 = 111). Similarly, he made 114 doces and sold 78 doces, so he sold 36 more doces than he made (78 - 114 = -36). So, in total, the baker sold 111 + (-36) = 75 more items than he made.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 games from Nintendo and she wants to have 140 games in total, then she needs to buy 118 more games (140 - 22 = 118).
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games from Nintendo and she gives 64 of them away, then she will have 42 remaining (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Kelly has 91 games from Nintendo and initially had 92 games, then he must have lost one game. So, the number of games he still has is 92 - 1 = 91.
Response:  If Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and wants to have 12 of them, she needs to give away 8 games from her collection (20 - 12 = 8).
"Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 games from Nintendo and wants to have 31 games from Sony. So we need to find out how many games of Sony she needs to give away in order to reach her goal. 
We can start by subtracting the number of games she already has (46) from the total number of games she wants (31):
46 - 31 = 15
So, Kelly needs to give away 15 games from Sony in order to reach her goal."
Response:  If Kelly already has 80 games from Nintendo and she found additional 31 games, then the total number of games she now has is 80 + 31 = 111 games. To find out how many more games she needs to have 6 games, we can divide 111 by 6: 111 / 6 = 18. So, Kelly needs 18 more games from Nintendo to have 6 games in total.
"Response:  If Randy has x quarteirões at the beginning and he uses them to build a tower with y quarteirões, then after using those quarteirões, he will have x - y quarteirões left. Since there are 52 quarteirões in total, we can write an equation:
x + y = 52... (1)
Now, we know that Randy used 38 quarteirões for building the tower, so the number of quarteirões he had left is:
x - y = 38... (2)
Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:
x = 14
So, Randy had 14 quarteirões at the beginning."
"Response:  If Randy has 97 quarterlands and he uses some blocks to build a tower, then he will have less than 97 quarterlands left after building the tower. We can assume that he used x number of blocks to build the tower, where x is a positive integer. Therefore, the total number of quarterlands Randy has after building the tower is:

97 - x

Since there are 4 quarterlands in each block, we can write:

(97 - x) / 4 = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 72 \* 4 = 288

Therefore, Randy constructed the tower using 288 blocks."
Response:  If Randy has 79 quarterlands and he uses 14 blocks to build a tower, then he will have 79 - 14 = 65 quarterlands left for other things. Similarly, if he uses 11 blocks to build a house, he will have 65 - 11 = 54 quarterlands left. So there are 54 quarterlands remaining.
Response:  We know that Randi has 58 quarterlands and he uses 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So we can write this as an equation: Tower = 27 blocks House = 53 blocks Now we need to find out how many blocks Randi used in total for both the tower and the house. To do this, we add the number of blocks needed for each one together: Total blocks = Number of blocks for the tower + Number of blocks for the house In this case, the total number of blocks is: Total blocks = 27 + 53 = 80 blocks Therefore, Randi used 80 blocks in total to build his tower and his house.
Response:  According to the problem, Randy has 37 quarterlands and he uses 33 blocks for building a tower and 13 blocks for building a house. To find out how many more blocks were used in building the tower than in building the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used in building the house from the number of blocks used in building the tower. So, the difference between 33 and 13 is equal to 20 (blocks). Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  According to the question, Randi has 86 quarterlands and he uses 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for building the tower from the total number of blocks available (86 - 79 = 7). So, Randi used 7 more blocks to build the house than to build the tower.
Response:  If Randy had 36 quarterlands to build a tower and he used all of them, then he has none left. So, if he had 59 quarterlands in total, he would have 23 quarterlands left over after using 36 for the tower.
"Response:  We know that Rand has used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write this as follows:
House = 20 blocks
Tower = 50 blocks
Now, let's find out how many more blocks were used for building the tower than for building the house. To do this, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower:
More blocks used in the tower = 50 - 20 = 30 blocks
So, Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
Response:  We know that Randi has 90 quarterlands and he used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks were used for the house than for the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 89 - 63 = 26. Therefore, Randi used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read 5 of them, then you must have read at least 15 books. So, the answer is 15.
"Response:  If there are already 13 books in the series and you still have to read 8 more, then the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

So, there are 21 books in the ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 22 different books in the series and you have already read 12 of them. So, there are 22 - 12 = 10 more books to read.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies in the series ""Stupid School"". If you have read 19 books and seen 7 movies, then we can deduce that there are 10 movies left to see. Therefore, the answer is 10."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"". If you have read 19 books and seen 13 movies, then we can deduce that there are more books than movies in the series. Specifically, there are 5 more books (19 - 14 = 5) than movies (13). Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"". If you have read 19 books and seen 61 movies, then we can say that for every book you have read, there are approximately 3 movies (61 / 19 = 3). So, if there are more movies than books in the series, it means that for each book, there are at least 3 movies. Therefore, there are more movies than books in the series ""Escola Louca e Estranha""."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Magic"". If you read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then you have read more books than you have watched movies. So, the answer is 1 (one)."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Magic"". If you have read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then you have not read any more movies than books. Therefore, the answer is (0)."
"Response:  If you have read 8 books from the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"", and there are 14 different books in the series, then you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books in the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"". If you have seen 34 films, then you still need to watch 28 more films (62 - 34 = 28). Similarly, if you have read 4 books, then you still need to read 15 more books (19 - 4 = 15). Therefore, you have 28 films and 15 books left to watch/read."
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series. If you have seen 4 movies, then you still need to see 8 - 4 = 4 more movies. So, you have 4 movies left to watch.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"". If John has read 11 books and seen 40 movies, then we can say that he has not seen any of the remaining 3 movies (14 - 40 = 3). Therefore, there are 3 more books than movies in the series ""Escola Louca e Estranha"". So, the answer is 3."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series ""Escola Louca e Estúpida"". If you have read 13 books and seen 63 movies, then we can deduce that there are more movies than books in the series. Specifically, there are 4 more movies (63 - 13 = 50) than books in the series."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series ""School of Witchcraft and Magic"". If we have read 14 movies and seen 19 books, then we must have read more books than movies. So, the number of books read is greater than the number of movies watched. To find out exactly how many more books were read, let's use algebra. Let x be the number of books read and y be the number of movies watched. From the problem statement, we know that x - y = 14 (the number of movies read) - 19 (the number of books seen). Simplifying this equation, we get x > y. In other words, you have read more books than movies."
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series. If we read 19 movies and saw 16 books, then we must have seen more movies than books. So, the number of movies watched is greater than the number of books read. To find out how many more movies were watched, we can subtract the number of books read from the total number of movies watched: 19 - 16 = 3. Therefore, the person has watched 3 more movies than they have read books.
Response:  If Dave had won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used at least 2 tickets for that purpose since he still has 2 tickets left. So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy toys is 2.
Response:  If Dave had won 15 tickets and used 12 to buy toys, then he has 3 (15 - 12) remaining tickets. So, Dave gained 3 tickets in the game room.
Response:  If Dave had won 18 tickets and used 5 to buy toys, he would have 18 - 5 = 13 remaining tickets. Then, if he used 11 more tickets to buy clothes, he would be left with 13 - 11 = 2 tickets. So, Dave had 2 tickets left after buying both toys and clothes.
Response:  If Dave won 19 tickets and used 12 to buy toys, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets. Now, if he also used 7 to buy clothes, that means he spent all his remaining tickets (7) on clothes. So, Dave used more tickets to buy clothes than he did for toys. Therefore, the difference between the number of tickets Dave used for buying clothes and toys is 7.
Response:  If Dave won 13 tickets and used 8 of them to buy toys, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he used 18 tickets to buy clothes, then he spent 18 - 8 = 10 tickets on clothes. So, Dave used more tickets to buy clothes than he did for toys. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. He used 10 of those tickets to buy toys, so he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave had 2 tickets left after buying toys.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 14 trees in the quarter of Delia. After the storm, 9 trees died. So, we need to find out how many trees died in the storm. To do this, we can divide the number of trees that died (9) by the total number of trees planted (14). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees in the quarter of Delia. After the storm (Tufão 6), 6 trees died. So, we have to find out how many trees survived the storm. To do this, we need to subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees planted. Therefore, the answer is: 13 - 6 = 7 trees survived the storm.
Response:  We know that initially there were 20 trees in the Haley's garden. After the storm, 4 trees were left. So, we can say that 16 trees (i.e., 20 - 4) died in the storm. Therefore, the answer is 16.
"Response:  If Haley planted x trees in her backyard before the storm and after the storm, 12 trees were left, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 12 = 0
Now solve for x:
x = -12
So, Haley had 12 fewer trees in her backyard after the storm than she did before it."
"Response: 
Haley had 9 trees in her garden before the storm. After the storm, 4 of them died. So now she has 9 - 4 = 5 trees left. Then, she plants 5 more trees. Therefore, she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total."
Response:  If two trees died after a hurricane and Haley had initially grown 12 trees in her backyard, then she has... (Do you want to know the answer?)
Response:  If she had initially planted 3 trees and after that 13 trees died due to the storm, then the total number of trees she had was 3 + 13 = 16. So, the difference between the number of trees that survived and the number of trees that died is 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, 3 more trees died than survived.
Response:  We know that after the hurricane, two trees in Haley's backyard died. Initially, she had planted 11 trees there. So, we can say that the number of surviving trees is equal to the initial number minus the number of dead trees. In this case, it would be: Number of surviving trees = 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, nine trees survived the hurricane.
"Response:  If they collect 66 bags per day and each bag contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges are collected in total per day as follows:

Total number of oranges = Number of bags x Number of oranges per bag
= 66 x 28
= 1904 oranges per day
Therefore, they collect 1904 oranges per day."
Response:  If they can collect 8 bags per day, it means that in one week (7 days) they will be able to collect 56 bags (8 x 7). To collect 24 bags of oranges, it will take them approximately 10 weeks (24 / 56 = 10).
"Response:  If it takes 4 days to collect all the oranges and they will be collected in bags of 10 oranges each, then we can calculate how many bags are collected per day as follows:

Number of bags collected per day = Total number of bags / Number of days for collection
= 56 bags / 4 days
= 14 bags per day
Therefore, 14 bags of oranges are collected per day."
Response:  After 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 49 x 38 = 1752 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 87 x 66 = 5904 sacs of oranges. Since each sack contains 25 oranges, we have 5904 x 25 = 147,500 oranges in total. Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, there will be 147,500 oranges.
Response:  If they collect 8 bags per day and each bag contains 35 oranges, then they collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they collect 16 bags per day and each bag contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect 16 x 57 = 904 oranges. To collect 80 bags of oranges, it will take them 80 / 904 = 8.83 days. Therefore, it will take them approximately 8 days and 22 hours to collect 80 bags of oranges.
Response:  If they collect 67 bags per day and each bag contains 12 oranges, then in one day they will collect 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. To find out how many oranges are collected if they collect a total of 35 bags, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of oranges per bag: 35 x 804 = 28,160 oranges. Therefore, they collect 28,160 oranges.
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3690 bags of oranges. Since they discard 71 bags per day, after 51 days there will be 3690 - 71 = 3620 bags of oranges left.
"Response:  We know that they collect 76 bags per day and discard 64 of them. This means that the total number of laranjas collected is equal to the number of bags collected minus the number of bags discarded. So, we can write an equation:

Number of laranjas collected = Number of bags collected - Number of bags discarded

We also know that each bag contains 50 laranjas, so we can express this in terms of our equation:

Number of laranjas collected = (Number of bags collected - Number of bags discarded) x 50

Now we have two equations and two unknowns: the number of bags collected and the number of laranjas collected. Can you use these equations to find the answers you are looking for?"
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 28 x 26 = 704 bags of ripe oranges and 52 x 26 = 1328 bags of unripe oranges. So after 26 days, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 sacs of mature oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 sacs of immature oranges. So, in total, they will have 3575 sacs of oranges after 25 days of harvesting.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1365 bags of ripe oranges and 24 x 45 = 1080 bags of unripe oranges. So, after 45 days, they will have 1365 - 1080 = 285 bags of unripe oranges left.
Response:  We know that 44 bags of mature oranges are collected per day and 25 bags of immature oranges are collected per day. So, we can write this information in an equation: 44 + 25 = x, where x is the number of bags of mature oranges collected per day. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: 44 - 25 = x. Simplifying the equation gives us x = 19. Therefore, 19 more bags of mature oranges are collected than immature oranges per day.
Response:  We know that 5 sacs of mature oranges are collected per day and 74 sacs of immature oranges are not collected per day. So, we can write this information in an equation: 5 + 74 = x, where x is the number of immature oranges collected per day. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x - 5 = 74. Therefore, there are 79 immature oranges collected per day more than the mature oranges.
Response:  If they collected 54 bags of oranges in total, and they picked 18 bags per day, then it took them... (do the calculation)
"Response:  If they collected 56 bags of oranges in one day, and they collected oranges for 14 days, then they collected a total of 

$$ \text {Total number of bags} = \text {Number of bags per day} \times \text{ Number of days } $$

So, we have:

$$ \text {Total number of bags} = 56 \times 14 = 768 $$

Therefore, they collected $ 768$ bags of oranges in total."
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, they will have collected 5 sacs of ripe oranges per day. Therefore, in total, they will have collected 5 x 73 = 365 sacs of ripe oranges after 73 days of harvesting.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, if they are collecting 46 bags of ripe oranges per day, then in total, they will have collected 276 bags (46 x 6) of oranges during those 6 days. Since they started with 65 bags of unripe oranges and collected 46 bags of ripe oranges per day, after 6 days, they will have collected a total of 311 bags (65 + 276) of oranges. So, there will be 311 bags of unripe oranges left after 6 days of harvesting.
Response:  We know that in total, they collect 41 + 86 = 127 sacs of oranges per day. So, if they collect more mature oranges than immature ones, we can say that the number of mature oranges collected is equal to the total number of oranges collected minus the number of immature oranges collected. Therefore, the number of mature oranges collected per day is 127 - 41 = 86 sacs per day.
"Response:  We know that in total, 71 sacs of unripe oranges and 60 sacs of ripe oranges are collected per day. So we have:

Total number of oranges = Number of unripe oranges + Number of ripe oranges
= 71 + 60
= 131

Now, let's find out how many more unripe oranges than ripe ones are collected each day:

Number of unripe oranges collected - Number of ripe oranges collected
= 71 - 60
= 11

So, every day, 11 more sacs of unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges."
Response:  The length of the room is given as 3 meters and its width is also 3 meters. So, we can say that the length of the room is equal to its width (L = W). Now, we are asked how much longer the room is than it is wide. To find this, we need to subtract the width from the length: L - W = 3 - 3 = 0 meters. Therefore, the room is not longer or wider than it is wide.
"Response:  We know that the length of Jesse's room is 2 meters = 6 feet (since there are 0.3048 meters in one foot). So, if we want to find out how wide the room needs to be for a carpet with an area of 14 square feet, we can use the fact that there are 12 inches in one foot and 0.0929 meters in one inch. Therefore, the width of the room needed for the carpet would be:

Width = Length / Area required
= 6 feet / 14 square feet
= 0.432 meters

So, the width of Jesse's room needed for the carpet is approximately 0.432 meters or 170.5 inches."
Response:  We know that the width of Jesse's room is 2 meters = 6 feet (since there are 3 feet in a meter). So, we can find out how long the room is by multiplying its width by its length. Since the room needs a carpet with an area of 14 square feet, and each foot is equal to 12 inches, we have: Room length = Width x Length = 6 ft x? = 72 sq ft Now, we need to divide the required area of the carpet by the area of the room to get the length of the room: Room length = Required carpet area / Room area = 14 sq ft / 72 sq ft = 1.94 meters or approximately 6.38 feet. Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is approximately 6.38 feet.
"Response:  The room is described as being 20 feet long and 30 feet wide (or 6 meters x 9 meters). So, we have:
Length = 20 feet = 6 meters
Width = 30 feet = 9 meters
Area of the room = Length x Width = 6 x 9 = 54 square meters
Now, we are told that the fourth side of the Jesse has 3 meters of carpet already laid out. This means that the length of the fourth side is 3 meters. Since this is also the width of the room, we can say that the area of the fourth side is equal to half the area of the room:
Area of the fourth side = Half Area of Room = 54 / 2 = 27 square meters
So, there are still 27 square meters of carpet left to lay down in order to cover the entire floor."
Response:  The room has a total area of 4 meters x 4 meters = 16 square meters. Since each tile covers 1 meter squared, we need 16 tiles to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We know that each quarter has a length of 6 meters and a width of 6 meters. Therefore, one square meter of floor space in any room is equal to 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Since there are 20 rooms, we need to cover an area of 36 x 20 = 720 square meters of flooring.
"Response:  The width of the room is given as $6$ meters and its length is also given as $6$ meters. So, we can say that the area of the room is equal to the product of its width and length, which is:
$$Area = Width \times Length = 6 \times 6 = 36$$
Now, let's find out how much longer the fourth of Jesse is than it is wide:
$$Longer = Width \div Height = 36 \div 4 = 9$$
So, the fourth of Jesse is $9$ meters longer than it is wide."
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 1.5 meters and we need to find out how wide it is. So, if the length is 1.5 meters, then the width must be half of that value, which is 75 cm or 0.75 meters. Therefore, the width of the room is 0.75 meters.
Response:  We know that the length of the room is twice the width of the rug, so if the rug needs to cover an area of 3 meters squared, and it has a length of x meters, then we can set up the equation: Length = 2 Width. Solving for the width, we get: Width = Length / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5 meters. So, the width of the room is 1.5 meters.
Response:  The room has an area of 6 meters squared (m²) and we know that one meter is equal to 1.20 m in length and 6.20 m in width. So, the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 1.20 m x 6.20 m = 7.44 m². Now, since we have 6 meters squared of carpet available, we need enough carpet to cover the entire floor. To do this, we will divide the total area of the room by the area covered by each piece of carpet. In other words, we will divide 7.44 m² by 6 m², which gives us approximately 1.23 pieces of carpet needed to cover the entire floor. Therefore, O Jesse needs approximately 1.23 pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor.
"Response:  The shop sells $23 per shirt and earned $230 during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. To find out how many shirts were sold, we can divide the amount earned by the price of each shirt:

$230 / $23 = 9

So, they sold 9 shirts."
Response:  The total cost of selling 3 t-shirts is $ 51. Since each shirt costs $ 17, we can write this equation: $ 51 = 3 × $ 17. Therefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $ 17.
Response:  We know that during both games, they sold a total of 95 t-shirts and $87 was made for each shirt sold. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make from those sales? $$ = \text {Number of t-shirts} \times \text{Amount made per t-shirt}$$$$ = 47 \times 87 = 3,999$  Therefore, they made $3,999 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
"Response:  We know that the store gained $106 for each shirt sold during both games combined. So if they sold x shirts during the Texas Tech game, they gained $x \* $106 = y dollars. Since they sold a total of 242 shirts between both games, we can set up the equation:

y = 242 - 115 (from the Arkansas game) + x (from the Texas Tech game)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 115 from both sides of the equation:

y - 115 = x

Now we have an equation with only one variable, x. We can divide both sides of the equation by 242 to find out how many shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game:

x / 242 = y / 242 - 115

Simplifying and solving for x gives us:

x = 77

So the store sold 77 shirts during the Texas Tech game."
Response:  We know that the store made $98 per sold shirt and they sold 163 shirts in total during both games. So if they sold 89 shirts during the Arkansas game, then they made $8570 ($98 x 89) from selling shirts during the Arkansas game.
"Response:  If the store sold $78 per shirt during the Arkansas game and they sold 172 shirts during that game, then the total amount of money made from those sales is:

$78 x 172 = $13,040

Now, we are told that the store also sold 114 shirts during the Texas Tech game. So if we multiply the number of shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by the price per shirt, we get:

$78 x 114 = $9,052

Therefore, the store made a total of $22,092 in revenue from selling t-shirts during both games."
Response:  The store makes $62 for each T-shirt and $99 for each hoodie. So if they sold 183 T-shirts, they made $11,540 ($62 x 183). If they sold 31 hoodies, they made $2,799 ($99 x 31). In total, the store made $14,339 from selling T-shirts and hoodies during the game.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $67 x 74 = $4890. From selling hoodies, they earned $165 x 156 = $25,340. So, in total, they made $4890 + $25,340 = $30,230.
"Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $ 19 and that of each sweatshirt is $ 34. So, if they sold 157 T-shirts at $ 19 each, then their total revenue from T-shirts would be:

$ 157 x $ 19 = $ 2807

Similarly, if they sold 19 sweatshirts at $ 34 each, then their total revenue from sweatshirts would be:

$ 19 x $ 34 = $ 656

Now, let's find out how much more a sweatshirt costs than a T-shirt:

Total revenue from sweatshirts - Total revenue from T-shirts
= $ 656 - $ 2807
= $- 2151

So, a sweatshirt costs $ 2151 more than a T-shirt."
Response:  The cost of each shirt is $23 and the cost of each jacket is $86. So if we want to find out how much more expensive a jacket is than a shirt, we need to subtract the price of a shirt from the price of a jacket. Therefore, the difference between the cost of a jacket and a shirt is: $86 - $23 = $63. So, one jacket costs $63 more than one shirt.
Response:  The cost price per T-shirt is $51. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they offered an discount of $8 per T-shirt and sold 130 T-shirts. So, total revenue from selling T-shirts = Number of T-shirts sold x Cost price per T-shirt - Discount given per T-shirt. In this case, Total revenue = 130 x $51 - $8 = $6,420.
"Response:  The original price of each T-shirt is $201. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the price increased to $217 per T-shirt, and they sold 14 T-shirts. So, the total amount of money made from selling T-shirts during that time period is:

$217 x 14 = $2,909

Therefore, the store made $2,909 in revenue from selling T-shirts during the game."
Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, $60 was made selling Razorback merchandise. If they make $10 for each shirt sold, how many shirts were sold? So we can calculate it like this: Number of shirts = Total amount earned / Amount per shirt. In this case, number of shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 shirts. Therefore, 6 shirts were sold.
Response:  We know that $215 was made selling 5 shirts and we want to find out how much each shirt cost. So, let's divide $215 by 5: $$ \frac {215} {5} = 43 $$ Therefore, each shirt costs $43.
Response:  The shop earns $5 for each T-shirt and $215 for each hat. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 20 T-shirts and 64 hats. So, the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is 20 x $5 = $100, and the total amount of money earned from selling hats is 64 x $215 = $13,760. Therefore, the total amount of money earned during the game is $100 + $13,760 = $13,860.
"Response:  The shop earns $204 for each T-shirt and $76 for each baseball shirt. They sold 158 T-shirts and two baseball shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So they earned a total of:
$204 x 158 = $31,920 from selling T-shirts
$76 x 2 = $152 from selling baseball shirts
Total amount earned by the store = $31,920 + $152 = $32,072
Therefore, the store made $32,072 in revenue from selling these items during the game."
"Response:  The cost of each shirt is $240 and that of each T-shirt is $210. So, if we have sold 177 T-shirts at $210 each, then the total revenue from T-shirts would be:

$177 x $210 = $36,970

Similarly, if we have sold 23 camisolas at $240 each, then the total revenue from Camisolas would be:

$23 x $240 = $5,320

Now, let's find out how much more does a camisola cost than a T-shirt:

Cost of one Camisola - Cost of one T-Shirt =?
= $5,320 - $36,970 = $31,650

So, a camisola costs approximately $31,650 more than a T-shirt."
"Response:  The cost of each shirt is $25 and that of each T-Shirt is also $25. So, we have two equations:

Camiseta = T-Shirt +? (Since they sold more Camisetas than T-Shirts)
T-Shirt =? (Since they sold less T-Shirts than Camisetas)
Now, let's substitute the values from the question into these equations:
Equation 1: Camiseta = T-Shirt + x
x = 78 - 113 = -35

Therefore, one Camiseta costs $115 - $25 = $90 more than one T-Shirt."
Response:  They have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs. So, in total they have 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. Therefore, there are 50 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If they have two tables with the same number of chairs and there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard, then each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  If they have three chairs at each of the three tables, then there are 3 x 3 = 9 chairs in total. So, if there are 9 chairs and 9 people attending the party, then each person will sit on one chair. Therefore, there is only one set of tables with three chairs.
Response:  They decided to give the party in their backyard. If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then... (calculate)...they have 11 x 13 = 143 chairs in total.
Response:  If they have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then there are 10 x 6 = 60 chairs in total. Since there are 11 people sitting, that means 60 - 11 = 49 chairs are left unoccupied.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. So, in total, we have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Then, we have 6 additional chairs. Therefore, the number of chairs for the guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If they have 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since 14 people will attend the party, they will need an additional 2 chairs (to accommodate all the guests). Therefore, they will have to buy 2 more chairs. So, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14 chairs.
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for each table and they decide to give a party in their backyard with 9 sets of tables, then they will need 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. So, they have 126 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Lewis earns $460 during 5 weeks of harvest, that means he earned $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, then we can find out how many weeks the harvest lasted as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
So, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks of harvest, he will have earned a total of:

$21 x 216 = $4,380

Now, if he has to pay $702 in taxes, his remaining amount after taxes would be:

$4,380 - $702 = $3,678

Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $3,678 left."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week during 223 weeks of harvest season, then he has earned total amount of money equal to...
Step-by-step solution:
Let x be the number of seasons that Lewis works during which he earns $1357 per week. Since there are 73 stations of harvest, we can write:
$$ \text {Total amount of money earned} = \text{Number of seasons} \times \text{Weekly income} $$
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
$$ \boxed{\text{Total amount of money earned}} = \boxed{x} \times \boxed{$1357} \text{per week} $$
Now, we need to find out how many weeks Lewis works during each station of harvest. We know that there are 223 weeks of harvest season and 73 stations of harvest. Therefore, we can write:
$$ \frac{\text{Total amount of money earned}}{\text{Number of weeks of harvest season}} = \frac{\boxed{x}}{223} $$
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
$$ \boxed{x} = \boxed{496} $$
So, Lewis works for 496 weeks during all the 73 stations of harvest. Now, let's calculate his total earnings:
$$ \boxed{Total amount of money earned} = \boxed{496} \times \boxed {$1357} \text{per week} $$
Therefore, Lewis earns a total of $648,094 during all the 73 stations of harvest."
Response:  During the harvest season, Lewis earns $28 per week for 10 weeks = $280. Additionally, he works overtime and earns $939 per week for 10 weeks = $9,390. Therefore, during the harvest season, Lewis earns a total of $9,670 ($280 + $9,390).
"Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvest and has to pay $49 in taxes per week, then his total income during that period is:

Total income = Weekly income x Number of weeks
= $403 x 233
= $91,530
Therefore, Lewis makes $91,530 during the harvest season."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $368 per week during the harvest season of 1359 weeks and he has to pay $388 in taxes per week, then we can calculate how much money he pays in taxes as follows:

Taxes paid = Weekly income x Number of weeks
= $368 x 1359
= $472,097

So, Lewis pays $472,097 in taxes during the harvest season."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks of harvest and has to pay $216 in taxes per week, at the end of the harvest season he will have:

$491 x 1181 = $573,000 (earnings)
-$216 x 1181 = $243,000 (taxes paid)
= $330,000 (net earnings)"
Response:  If Lewis gains $133 during 19 weeks of harvest, that means he earns $6.70 per week ($133 / 19 = $6.70).
Response:  If O Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest, then he earned a total of $2 x 17 weeks = $34 in income from harvest work. So, if he earned a total of $178, that means the harvest lasted for $178 / $34 = 52 weeks.
Response:  If the depth of the water is 10 times the height of Dean and he is at 9 feet, then we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 10 x 9 = 90 feet. So, the water is 90 feet deeper than the height of Dean.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to swim. The depth of the water is twice the height of Dean. Since Dean is shorter than Ron, if Ron is at a depth of 4 meters, then the depth of the water was 8 meters.
Response:  The depth of the water is 5 times the height of Ron. So if Ron is at 12 feet, then the depth of the water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet. Since Dean is shorter than Ron, he will also be less immersed in the water. Therefore, his height (or distance from the surface) is equal to half the difference between the depth and the surface. In this case, that means he is 30 feet away from the surface (since the depth is 60 feet).
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to swim. The depth of the water is 15 times the height of the Dean. So if the Dean is taller than Ron, then the depth of the water must be greater than 15 times the height of Ron. Therefore, the depth of the water is equal to or greater than 225 meters (15 x 150).
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to swim. The depth of the water is 16 times the height of Ron. Since Dean is taller than Ron, we can say that Dean is at least as tall as 16Ron. If Ron is at 4 meters, then Dean must be at least 64 meters (16 x 4) above the water level. So, the depth of the water was 64 meters.
Response:  We know that after resting, they decided to swim. The depth of the water is 9 times the height of Dean. So if Ron has a height of 5 meters and Dean is shorter than him, we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 9 times 5 = 45 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water was 45 meters.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and distributes them equally among 2 shelves, then each shelf will have Books = 34 / 2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he must have... (1)

Step-by-step solution:
Let B be the number of shelves that Brian has. Since each shelf contains 2 books, we can write:
B × 2 = 42
Now, we need to find out how many shelves Brian has. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
B = 42 / 2
B = 21
Therefore, Brian has 21 shelves."
Response:  If he has 27 books in each of his 23 bookshelves, then he has 27 x 23 = 611 books in total. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines in each of his 23 magazine racks, then he has 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines in total. So, in total, Brian has 611 + 1840 = 2451 items in his collection.
Response:  If he has 9 books in each of his 10 bookshelves, then he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines in each of his 10 magazine racks, then he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines. So, he has a total of 90 books and 460 magazines.
Response:  If he has 23 books in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has 23 x 29 = 647 books in total. Similarly, if he has 61 magazines in each of his 29 magazine racks, then he has 61 x 29 = 1759 magazines in total. So, Brian has 647 books and 1759 magazines in total.
Response:  If Brian has 7 bookshelves with the same number of books, then he must have 7 x 28 = 196 books in total. Since each shelf has the same number of books, we can divide the total number of books by 7 to find out how many books are in each shelf. So, there are 196 / 7 = 28 books in each shelf.
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then...

1. How many shelves does Brian have if he has 38 books?

$ $38 = 19 \text {shelves} $

So, Brian has 19 shelves.

2. How many books are there in each shelf?

Since each shelf contains 2 books, there are 2 x 19 = 38 books in all."
"Response:  If Carol wants to send invitations to 10 friends and each package of invitations she bought has 2 invitations, then we can write this as:

Number of packages = Number of friends / Number of invitations per package
= 10 / 2
= 5

So, Carol needs to buy 5 packages of invitations to make sure that none of her friends are left out."
Response:  If Carol is sending invitations to 12 friends and she bought three packages of invitations with the same number of invitations in each package, then we can say that there are 12 / 3 = 4 invitations per package. So, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packages of invitations and each package has 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she is sending invitations to only 2 friends, the number of invitations left for her to send is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 6 packages of invitations, each containing 14 invitations. Therefore, she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she bought additional 11 invitations. So, her final number of invitations is 84 + 11 = 95 invitations.
Response:  If Carol bought 2 packages of invitations each containing 3 invitations, then she has in total 60 invitations (2 x 30 = 60). To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 3 invitations (9 - 60 = 3). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game and she played $n$ games, then her total score is given by $\sum_{i=1}^n 12$. Since she scored a total of 36 points, we have $n = \frac{36}{12} = 3$. So, Melissa played $3$ games.
"Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in each of the three games she played, then we can write an equation based on this information:

Melissa's score in game 1 = 81
Melissa's score in game 2 = 81
Melissa's score in game 3 = 81

Now, let's solve for Melissa's score in each game separately:

Game 1:
Melissa's score = 81

Game 2:
Melissa's score = 81

Game 3:
Melissa's score = 81

So, to summarize, Melissa scored 81 points in each of the three games she played."
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each game and won 82 points in each game, then she must have scored a total of 82 x 79 = 6351 points overall. Therefore, the correct answer is 6351 points.
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 21 points in some games and she scored 7 points in each game. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game Now, we are asked to find out how many games Melissa played. Therefore, we need to solve for the variable ""Number of games"" in the above equation. We know that the total score is 21, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in 13 games, then she must have scored an average of 91/13 = 7 points per game. So, she scored 7 points in each game.
Response:  If there are 4 places in the giant wheel at the Park of Paradise and 20 people can ride it simultaneously, then each place can contain 5 people (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If each place in the giant wheel can accommodate 9 people, then we need to know how many places there are in total. We are told that 18 people can ride at the same time, so if we divide 18 by 9, we get 2. Therefore, the giant wheel has 2 places or seats.
"Response:  Each giant wheel in the Park of Paradise has 19 seats. Since each seat can accommodate 15 people, we have:

Number of seats = Number of people who can ride at once x Number of wheels
= 19 x 15
= 285 people
Therefore, 285 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously."
Response:  The giant wheel in the Park of Paradise has 18 seats, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then the total number of seats available is 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, at most 8 people can ride the giant wheel at the same time.
Response:  The giant wheel in the Park of Paradise has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people. If there are currently 16 people in the wheel, how many more people can join it? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people already in the wheel from the total capacity of the wheel. So, the answer is 16 - 14 = 2. Therefore, two more people can join the wheel.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small places in the giant wheel at the Park of Paradise, which can accommodate 14 people each, so together they can accommodate 28 people. And we also know that there are 23 large seats in the wheel, which can accommodate 54 people each, so altogether they can accommodate 1204 people. Therefore, the number of people who can ride the giant wheel in small seats is 28.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small places with 16 people each = 48 people in total. And we have 7 big places with 12 people each = 84 people in total. So, the total number of people who can fit in the giant wheel is 84 + 48 = 132 people.
Response:  If 16 people can fit in the giant wheel at the same time, then each place on the wheel can hold 16/4 = 4 people. So, each place on the wheel can contain 4 people.
"Response:  If four people can ride the giant wheel in the Paradise Park at the same time, and each place on the wheel can accommodate two people, then we need to calculate how many places there are on the wheel. To do this, we divide the number of people who can ride the wheel (4) by the number of people that each place can accommodate (2):

Number of places on the wheel = Number of people who can ride the wheel / Number of people per place
= 4 / 2
= 2
Therefore, the giant wheel has 2 places for riders."
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x Number of slices in one pizza = Total number of slices. Since there are 14 slices in total, the number of slices in each pizza is 14 / 7 = 2.
Response:  If we have a total of 28 slices and each slice is two slices long, then... (1 × 2 =) 2 pizzas.
Response:  If we have 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then... (17 x 4 =) 68 slices of pizza in total!
Response:  If we are two people and there are 9 pizzas in total, each pizza has 10 slices. So, if we distribute them equally between us, each person will receive 5 slices of pizza (since 2 x 5 = 10).
"Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 45 flower beds, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many seeds they planted altogether.
Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 45 flower beds, so they planted a total of 10 x 45 = 450 seeds."
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 45 seeds in total and they divided them equally among 9 flower beds, then each flower bed received an equal number of seeds. So, if we divide 45 by 9, we get the answer: Each flower bed received 5 seeds (45 ÷ 9 = 5).
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 36 seeds in total. Since they only got 58 flowers to grow out of each canteen, we can deduce that some seeds did not germinate or grew poorly. So, let's assume that 12 seeds (the number of seeds placed in each canteen) x 0.7 = 8 seeds did not germinate or grew poorly. Therefore, the number of seedlings that actually grew into flowers is 36 - 8 = 28. Hence, there were 28 colony birds.
"Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 55 seeds in total. Since they only sowed 15 seeds per canteen, we have:

Total number of seedlings = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per canteen
= 55 / 3 (since there are 3 canteens)
= 18

So, they cultivated 18 flowers in total."
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother to plant flowers in 10 canteiros. If they planted 60 seeds in total, then each canteen must have received 6 seeds (60 / 10 = 6). So, there will be 6 canteiros of flowers.
"Response:  If Paige was helping her mother to plant flowers in 8 gardens and they planted 32 seeds in total, then...
Step 1: How many seeds did they plant in each garden if they planted 32 seeds in total?
Step 2: What is the ratio of number of seeds planted per garden if they planted 32 seeds in total?
Step 3: Can you use this ratio to find out how many seeds were planted in each garden?
So, the answer is:
Number of seeds planted in each garden = Total number of seeds / Number of gardens
= 32 / 8
= 4 seeds/garden
Therefore, Paige and her mother planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 gardens."
"Response:  If Matthew has 11 friends and he gives each of them 2 cookies, then...

Matthew will give out a total of 2 x 11 = 22 cookies. So, Matthew had 22 cookies in total."
Response:  If Matthew had eight bolachas to give away and he gave two bolachas to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 8 / 2 = 4 friends bolachas. So, Matthew gave bolachas to 4 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 bolachas and gave the same number to each of his 5 friends, then he would have given away 15 x 5 = 75 bolachas. So, if he still has 10 bolachas left, that means he must have kept 10 - 75 = -65 bolachas. Since it is not possible to keep negative bolachas, we can conclude that Matthew did not give any bolachas to his friends. Therefore, none of his friends ate any bolachas.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 balls and gave the same number of balls to his three friends, then he would have given 8 balls to each friend (since 24 / 3 = 8). So, Matthew gave 8 balls to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 bolachas and 34 bolos, that means he had a total of 56 (22 + 34) items to distribute among his 11 friends. Since each friend received an equal number of items, the number of bolachas and bolos each person got can be found by dividing the total number of items by 11. Therefore, each person received 5 bolachas and 4 bolos (56 / 11 = 5 + 4).
"Response:  If Matthew had 29 bolachas and 30 bolos, then he gave each of his two friends an equal number of bolachas and bolos. So, if one friend got x bolachas and y bolos, then the other friend also got x bolachas and y bolos. Since there are 29 bolachas in total, the sum of the number of bolachas given to both friends is 29:
x + y = 29... (1)
Similarly, since there are 30 bolos in total, the sum of the number of bolos given to both friends is 30:
x + y = 30... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 14 and y = 16
So, each friend got 14 bolachas and 16 bolos."
Response:  If Matthew had 14 bolachas and 21 bolos, that means he had a total of 35 candies (14 bolachas + 21 bolos). If he gave the same number of candies to his 7 friends, then each friend received 35/7 = 5 candies (bolachas or bolos). So, each person consumed 5 bolachas or bolos.
Response:  If Matthew gave out the same number of cookies to his 18 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of cookies. So if he had 36 cookies in total, then he would have given 36/18 = 2 cookies to each friend.
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 bolachas to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 6 x 4 = 24 bolachas. Since he had 36 bolachas in total, that means he gave 36 - 24 = 12 bolachas left over after giving them all away. So, he gave bolachas to 4 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 cookies and gave an equal number to each of his two friends, then he gave 23/2 = 11 cookies to each friend. So, each friend got 11 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew had 31 bolachas and gave the same number of bolachas to his 5 friends, then he has 31 - 5 = 26 bolachas left. So, he gave 5 friends 26/5 = 5 bolachas each.
Response:  If Matthew had 32 bolachas and 98 bolos initially, that means he had 130 candies in total (32 + 98). Since he divided them equally among his four friends, each friend got 32/4 = 8 candies. So, Matthew did not eat any bolachas.
"Response:  If Matthew had initially 10 bolachas and 8 bolos, then he divided them equally among his 4 friends, so each friend got:

10/4 = 2.5 bolachas
8/4 = 2 bolos

So, each person received 2.5 bolachas and 2 bolos."
"Response:  If Matthew had 13 bolachas and 15 bolos initially, that means he had a total of 13 + 15 = 28 items to share among his 28 friends. Since each friend got an equal number of bolachas and bolos, we can say that each person received x bolachas and x bolos. We know from the question that the total number of bolachas and bolos shared is 28, so we can set up the equation:
x + x = 28
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 28
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 14
So, each person received 14 bolachas and 14 bolos."
"Response:  If Debbie drank 109 bottles of water per day and the promotion lasted for 74 days, then she must have bought:

$$ NumberOfGarrafas = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of bottles drunk per day}$$

So, we can calculate the number of garrafas that Debbie bought as follows:

$$ NumberOfGarrafas = 74 \times 109 = 8236 $$

Therefore, Debbie bought $8236$ garrafas of water during the promotion."
Response:  If Debbie drank 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and she drank the same number every day, then she must have drunk 9 bottles per day (153 / 17 = 9).
Response:  If Debbie bought 264 bottles of water and she drinks 15 per day for 11 days, then in total she will have drunk 1890 (15 x 11) bottles. So, after 11 days, she still has 75 (264 - 1890) bottles left.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 301 water bottles and drank 144 per day for some days, then she must have drunk x number of bottles during those days. Since she has 157 bottles remaining, we can set up an equation as follows: 
x + 301 = 157... (1) Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many days Debbie drank water. Subtracting 301 from both sides gives us: x = 156... (2) Dividing both sides by 144 gives us: x / 144 = y... (3) Where y is the number of days Debbie drank water. Solving for y in equation (3), we get: y = 10... (4) Therefore, Debbie drank water for 10 days."
"Response:  If Debbie drank 4 glasses of water per day and there were initially 88 bottles of water, it will last her for:

88 / 4 = 21 days

So, the water bottles will last Debbie for 21 days."
Response:  If Debbie drank 312 glasses of water per day and 4 glasses of refrigerant per day, it means she drank a total of 312 + 4 = 316 drinks per day. Since there are 256 bottles of refrigerant, it will last for 316 / 256 = 1.27 days. Therefore, the refrigerants will last for approximately 1.27 days.
Response:  If Debbie drinks six glasses of water per day, she will need 6 x 7 = 42 glasses of water in one week (since there are seven days in a week). Therefore, if she buys 12 bottles of water, she will have enough for 12 / 42 = 0.3 days, which is equivalent to approximately 1 day. So, Debbie would have enough water for about one day.
Response:  If Debbie drank 15 glasses of water per day and there were initially 180 bottles of water, then in one day she would drink 15/180 = 0.0833... bottles of water. Since there are 95 bottles of water left after one day, it will last for (95 / 0.0833...) = 112 days. Therefore, the water will last for 112 days.
"Response:  If Debbie drank 122 garrafas of water per day and 9 garrafas of refrigerant per day, it means that she drank a total of 131 garrafas (122 + 9) per day. Since there were initially 360 garrafas of refrigerant and 162 garrafas of water, we can calculate how many days the remaining refrigerant will last using the following formula: Number of days = Total quantity / Daily consumption x Days since purchase Where ""Total quantity"" is the initial amount of refrigerant purchased (in this case, 360), ""Daily consumption"" is the number of garrafas consumed per day (in this case, 9), and ""Days since purchase"" is the number of days that have passed since Debbie bought the refrigerant (in this case, 0). Substituting these values into the formula gives us: Number of days = 360 / 9 x 0 = 40 days Therefore, if Debbie continues to drink at this rate, the refrigerant will last for 40 days."
"Response:  If Faye has 11 lápices in each line and she is placing them in 14 rows, then...

11 x 14 = 154
So, Faye has 154 lápices in total!"
Response:  If Faye placed 12 pens in 3 rows, then she must have placed 4 pens in each row. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Faye had 28 maços de lápis and each maço has 24 lápis. So, in total, she had 28 x 24 = 672 lápis. Now, we are asked how many filas she could make with these lápis. To find out, we need to divide the number of lápis by the number of lápis in each fila, which is 16. Therefore, we can divide 672 by 16, giving us 43 filas. So, Faye could make 43 filas with the lápis she had.
Response:  We know that Faye has 6 maços de lápis, and each maço contains 14 lápis. Therefore, the total number of lápis in all six maços is 6 x 14 = 84 lápis. Now, we need to find out how many lápis Faye has placed in rows. The question states that she has placed 22 lápis in each row, so the total number of lápis in rows is 22 x 5 = 110 lápis. Finally, we add the number of lápis in rows to the number of lápis in all six maços to get the total number of lápis Faye has: 110 + 84 = 194 lápis. So, Faye has 194 lápis in total.
Response:  If Faye has 35 lápices in total and she wants to place them in rows of five each, then she will need 7 rows (since there are 7 different colors). So, she can make 7 lines.
Response:  If there are 19 fileiras and each fileira has 4 lápices, then the total number of lápices is 19 x 4 = 76. Additionally, if there are 27 lápices in each fileira, then the total number of lápices is 76 + 27 x 19 = 508. Therefore, Faye has 508 lápices.
"Response:  If there are 7 rows and each row has 36 pens (including both blue and red), then the total number of pens is:

7 rows x 36 pens/row = 252 pens

Now, we know that out of these 252 pens, 30 are red. So, the number of red pens is:

252 pens - 30 red pens = 222 pens

Therefore, Faye has 222 red pens in total."
Response:  We know that Faye has 11 rows of pens and pencils. Each row has 31 pens and 27 colored pencils. Therefore, in total, Faye has 31 x 11 = 341 pens and 27 x 11 = 307 colored pencils. So, Faye has 341 + 307 = 648 objects in total.
Response:  If Faye had 30 licks and wanted to place them in rows with 5 licks each line, she could have made 6 lines of licks (30 / 5 = 6). So, the number of rows that Faye was able to make is 6.
"Response:  If Faye had 6 pens and she placed them in two lines, then...

Line 1: 3 pens (since there are 6 pens total)
Line 2: 3 pens (again, since there are only 6 pens total)"
Response:  If Faye had 35 maços of pens, each with 4 pens inside, then she would have a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pens. Since she was placing the pens in rows with two pens in each row, she could make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of pens.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 maços of pencils and each maç contained 6 pencils. So, in total, she has 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Now, we are asked how many pencils she has after placing them in rows with 19 pencils in each line. Therefore, the number of pencils she has after arranging them in rows is 186 / 19 = 9.74 pencils. Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, the final answer is 9 pencils.
Response:  If Faye has 71 colored pens and she wants to place them in 30 rows, then each row will have how many pens? 30 x 71 = 2130 pens total.
Response:  We know that there are 16 rows and each row has 6 colored pens and 21 regular pens. So, in total, Faye has 16 x 6 = 96 colored pens and 16 x 21 = 356 regular pens. Therefore, Faye has 96 + 356 = 452 pens in total.
Response:  Since there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses, each bus can carry at most 14 students (since 98 / 7 = 14). So, there are 14 seats per bus.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each car has 118 students. So we have to calculate how many cars can fit in one classroom. To do this, we divide the number of students (118) by the capacity of each car (118). This gives us the number of cars that can fit in one classroom: 118 / 118 = 1. Therefore, we need 84 classrooms to accommodate all the cars. Now, let's count the total number of students: 84 classrooms x 1 student per classroom = 84 students. So, there are 84 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4232 students in the entire school. Since there are 6 places in each bus, we need at least 4232 / 6 = 705 buses to transport all the students for the field trip. So, the answer is 705 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 58 students. So, we have a total of 87 x 58 = 4960 students. Since two students will travel together in one car, we need to divide 4960 by 2 = 2480 cars. Therefore, 2480 cars are needed for the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in all classrooms is equal to 24 x Number of students per classroom = 24 x 120 = 2880 students. Since there are 84 seats in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats in each bus to find out how many students go on each trip. So, the number of students in each turma is 2880 / 84 = 35 students.
Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students in total. Since each car can accommodate 8 students, we need to divide the number of students by 8 to find out how many cars are needed: Number of cars = Total number of students / Capacity per car = 102 students / 8 students/car = 13 cars Therefore, 13 cars are necessary for the trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. Since each car can accommodate 99 students, we have:

Number of cars = Total number of students / Number of students per car
= 11 / 99
= 0.11 (or 11%)

So, approximately 11% or 11 out of 102 classrooms will go for the study trip. Therefore, 9 classrooms will not go for the study trip."
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each car can accommodate three students. So, we need to divide the number of students (111) by the capacity of each car (3). Therefore, we will need 37 cars for the trip.
Response:  Since there are 17 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an average of 30 students (which is just an estimate), we can assume that there will be approximately 510 students in all the classes combined (17 x 30 = 510). Now, since there are 46 school buses, if they are all full, then the number of students who can travel in each bus is 510 / 46 = 11.25 students per bus. So, there are approximately 11.25 students per bus.
Response:  If there are 11 students in class 11 and they all love playing balls, then the total number of balls they have is 11 x 9 = 99 balls. So, if Haley gives each student 9 balls, she will have 99 - 9 = 80 balls left.
Response:  If there are five boys and each boy received 5 balls from Hayley, then the total number of balls given to all the boys is 5 x 5 = 25 balls. So, Hayley gave 25 balls in total to the five boys.
Response:  If there are 4 boys in the class and they want to share the balls equally among themselves, then each boy will get 15/4 = 3.75 balls. Since you can't have a fraction of a ball, each boy will receive 4 balls.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who love to play balls and 50 who like to play cards, then we can say that each boy likes to play either balls or cards. So, if Haley has 26 ball, how many will each of them get? We need to divide the number of balls by the total number of boys playing with them. In this case, dividing 26 by 65 (the sum of the numbers of boys who like to play balls and cards) gives us 0.4 or 40%. Therefore, each boy will receive 40% of 26 balls = 10 balls.
Response:  If Haley has 20 balls and there are five boys in her class, each boy will receive how many balls? To find out, we can divide the total number of balls (20) by the number of boys (5). So, each boy will receive 4 balls (20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  If there are n boys in the group and Haley gives 2 balls to each boy, then she gave a total of 2n balls. Since she had 28 balls initially, we can deduce that n = 14 (since 28 - 2 × 14 = 0). So, Haley gave 28 balls to 14 boys.
"Response:  Since Frank read 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages, he will finish reading it in:

Days = Number of pages / Number of pages per day
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank took 27 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, we substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pages = 569 x 22 Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading his favorite book. So, he read for how many hours per day? 
Let's assume that each day he spent 8 hours reading (which is a reasonable amount of time). Therefore, he read for 8 hours/day x 6 days = 48 hours in total. 
Now, we need to divide the number of pages (612) by the total time he spent reading (in hours): 612 pages / 48 hours = 13 pages/hour. 
So, Frank read at an average rate of 13 pages per hour."
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 5 chapters in total, we can calculate how many pages each chapter has based on the number of days taken to read them: Chapter 1 - 220/5 = 44 pages Chapter 2 - 220/5 = 44 pages Chapter 3 - 220/5 = 44 pages Chapter 4 - 220/5 = 44 pages Chapter 5 - 220/5 = 44 pages Therefore, each chapter has approximately 44 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since there are 15 chapters in the book, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter by dividing the total number of days by the number of chapters: 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter. So, Frank read one chapter every 44 days.
"Response:  If Frank took 3 days to finish each book and each book has 249 pages, then he read for how many hours per day? 
Time taken = Total time / Number of books
= 3 days / 1 book
= 3 days/book
Now, let's find out how many pages Frank reads in one day.
Pages read per day = Time taken / Hours per day
= 3 days / 8 hours (assuming he reads for 8 hours a day)
= 376 pages/day
So, Frank reads 376 pages every day!"
Response:  If it took Frank 12 days to finish each book and he read 6 books in total, then it will take him 72 days (6 x 12 = 72) to finish all 6 books. However, if it takes him 492 days to finish all the books, that means he finished the last book in 492 - 72 = 420 days. So, Frank read 6 books in total.
"Response:  Since it took Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book, we can assume that he read at most $x$ pages per day, where $x$ is the number of days it took him to finish the book. Therefore, we have the equation:
$$\page = \frac{16}{x}$$
Now, we know that the book has 112 pages, so we can substitute this value into the previous equation:
$$\page = \frac{16}{x} \Rightarrow x = \frac{16}{\page}$$
Therefore, the answer is: $\page = 10$. So, Frank read $10$ pages per day on average."
"Response:  If Frank read 8 pages per day and the book had 576 pages, then he took X days to finish reading it. We can write an equation based on this information:

X = (Number of pages / Number of pages per day) x (Total number of days)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

X = (576 / 8) x (30)

Simplifying and solving for X, we get:

X = 42

Therefore, Frank took 42 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  Since there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Total pages = 41 x 450 = 17650 pages Now, let's find out how many days it took Frank to read the entire book. According to the question, he took 30 days to finish reading the book. So, we can calculate his daily page count as follows: Daily page count = Total pages / Number of days taken to read the book Daily page count = 17650 / 30 = 588 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 588 pages every day for 30 days to complete his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish reading his favorite book. This means he read at a constant rate during this time. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 594 = 1782 páginas. Substituting this value and the given time into the formula above, we get: Number of pages read per day = 1782 páginas / 607 dias = 29 páginas por dia Now, since each chapter has 594 pages, we can find out how many chapters there are by dividing the total number of pages by the page count of each chapter: Number of chapters = Total number of pages / Chapter page count In this case, the chapter page count is 594 pages, so: Number of chapters = 1782 páginas / 594 páginas = 3 chapters Therefore, each chapter has 594 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Number of chapters = Total number of chapters / Time taken to read them
= 2 x 405 pages/day

Therefore, Frank read two chapters every day for 664 days."
"Response:  If six DVDs can be bought with $120, then each DVD costs:
$120 / 6 = $20 per DVD"
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages of DVDs will cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
Therefore, buying 33 packages of DVDs will cost $2693."
Response:  The cost of each package is $107 and there is a discount of $106 in each package. To find out how many packages you can buy with $93, we need to divide $93 by the cost of one package minus the discount. So, $93 / ($107 - $106) = x. Since x is an integer, we know that you can buy x packages with $93. Therefore, the answer is x = 9.
Response:  The cost of each package is $76 and there is a discount of $25 in each package. So, to find out how much you have to pay for each package, we need to subtract the discount from the original price. Therefore, the amount you have to pay for each package is: $76 - $25 = $51.
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each package of DVDs costs $26, then...

$104 / $26 = 4 packages of DVDs
Therefore, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs with your $104."
Response:  If we have $28 and we want to buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package costs $\frac{28}{2} = 14$ dollars.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total and we want to group them into groups of size 2. So, how many groups can we make with these 18 bananas?

We can start by dividing the 18 bananas into two groups of 9 each:

Group 1: 9 bananas
Group 2: 9 bananas

Now, let's check if this is possible:

Yes, it is possible! We have successfully divided the 18 bananas into two groups of size 2. Therefore, the answer is 2."
"Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in Philip's collection and each group contains 187 bananas. So, we can write an equation: 
$$ \boxed{140} \times \boxed{187} =? $$
Now, let's solve for the unknown quantity (in this case, $x$, which represents the number of bananas Philip has in his collection):
$$ x = \boxed{140} \times \boxed{187} = 26,990 $$
Therefore, Philip has 26,990 bananas in his collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and we want to group them into 7 groups. So, each group will have 203/7 = 29 bananas. Similarly, we know that there are 63 oranges in total and we want to group them into 95 groups. So, each group will have 63/95 = 0.66 oranges per group.
Response:  We know that there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in the collection of Philip. If we organize the bananas into 47 groups, then each group will have 142/47 = 3 bananas. Similarly, if we organize the oranges into 178 groups, then each group will have 356/178 = 2 oranges. Therefore, each group of oranges has 2 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Philip's collection of bananas and he has a total of 392 bananas. Therefore, we can divide 392 by 196 to find out how many bananas each group contains: 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains 2 bananas.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 groups of size 18 in the collection of bananas owned by Philip. Since there are 180 bananas in the collection, we can divide them into groups as follows:

Group 1: 18 bananas
Group 2: 17 bananas (since 18 - 1 = 17)
Group 3: 16 bananas (since 17 - 1 = 16)
...
Group 17: 1 banana (since 180 / 18 = 10)

Therefore, there are 17 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and we want to divide them into two groups. So, let's assume that one group has x bananas. Then, we have 290 - x bananas left over. Now, we also know that there are 87 laranjas in total and we want to divide them into 93 groups. So, each group of laranjas will have y laranjas, where y is the number of groups minus 1 (since we don't need any groups with only one laranja). Therefore, we can write the following equation:
x + (290 - x) = 93y
Now, we need to solve this equation to find out how many bananas are in each group. To do this, we can first simplify the equation by combining like terms:
x + 290 - x = 93y
Simplifying further:
2x = 93y - 290
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 46.5
So, there are approximately 46.5 bananas in each group."
"Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total. If we divide the number of oranges by 16 (the number of groups we want to create), we get:

Number of oranges per group = Total number of oranges / Number of groups
= 384 / 16
= 24

So, each group will have 24 oranges."
"Response:  If the mother made 38 bolinhas and each of them has 19 bolinhos (bite-sized pieces), then...

Step 1: Calculate how many total bite-sized pieces there are in all 38 bolinhas.
Total number of bite-sized pieces = Number of bolinhas x Number of bite-sized pieces per bolinha
= 38 x 19
= 702

So, there were 702 bite-sized pieces for the guests to enjoy!"
Response:  If the mother of Brenda made 14 bolachas and each one had 30 bolinhos, then she prepared a total of... (do calculation)
Response:  If the mother of Brenda made 5 bolachas and prepared 22 bollhios, then she had to throw away 17 of them. So, each bollho has 5 - 17 = 12 bolachas. Therefore, each one would have 12 bolachas.
"Response:  If the mother made 18 biscuits and 9 did not come, then she gave each of the remaining 10 guests an equal number of biscuits (since they all had the same amount). So, if each guest received x biscuits, we can set up the equation:

x + x +... + x = 18

Since there are 10 guests in total, we have:

x = 18 / 10

So, each guest got 18/10 = 1.8 biscuits."
"Response:  If the mother of Brenda made 14 cookies for 2 guests and each guest had the same number of cookies as the other, then...

Step 1: Identify the information given in the question.

* The mother of Brenda made 14 cookies.
* Each cookie was for one guest.
* There were 2 guests.

Step 2: Use the information to find out how many cookies each guest received.

Let x be the number of cookies each guest received. Since there are 2 guests, the total number of cookies is 2x.
The problem states that the mother of Brenda made 14 cookies, so the total number of cookies including the ones for the two guests is 14 + 2x = 16.
Now, we have a equation: 16 = 2x.
Solving for x, we get x = 8.
So, each guest received 8 cookies.
Therefore, the answer is 8."
"Response:  If the mother made 10 biscuits in total for the guests and each guest had 2 biscuits, then...

Step 1: How many guests were there?
We know that the mother prepared 10 biscuits in total, so if each guest had 2 biscuits, then...

Number of guests = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits per guest
= 10 / 2
= 5 guests

So, there were 5 guests at the party."
Response:  If Frank has 42 candies and wants to put them equally in two bags, then each bag will have 42/2 = 21 candies. So there are 21 pieces of candy in each bag.
Response:  If Frank had $X$ doces and he put them in $26$ bags with $33$ pieces each, then the total number of pieces is $X \times 33 = X$. So, Frank had $X = 26 \times 33 = 840$ doces.
Response:  If Frank had 33 doces and lost 24 of them, he has 9 doces left. To divide these 9 doces into bags with 9 doces each, Frank will have 1 bag. So, Frank has one bag.
Response:  If Frank has 22 doces and he wants to put them in bags of 11 each, then... (1) He will need 2 bags. (2) Each bag contains 11 doces, so there are 2 x 11 = 22 doces in total.
Response:  If Frank had 16 doces in total and he divided them equally between two bags, then each bag would have 8 doces (16 / 2 = 8).
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 boxes of treats and each box contains 14 pieces of candy, then she needs to deliver 25 x 14 = 350 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  If Shirley sold 10 boxes of treats and each box contains 3 treats, then she has sold a total of 30 treats (10 x 3 = 30). Since she needs to deliver 5 boxes of treats, she will have delivered a total of 15 treats (5 x 3 = 15).
"Response:  The total number of garrafas of both types is given as 106 (67 + 9). So we can write:

Total number of regular refrigerant = 67
Total number of diet refrigerant = 9

Now, to find out how many more regular than diet refrigerants there are, we need to subtract the number of diet refrigerants from the total number of regular refrigerants:

Number of more regular refrigerants = Total number of regular refrigerants - Number of diet refrigerants
= 67 - 9
= 58

So, there were 58 more regular than diet refrigerants in the supermarket."
Response:  The supermarket had 22 regular bottles of refrigerant and 61 dietary bottles of refrigerant. So in total they had 83 bottles (22 + 61). Therefore, they had more than 22 bottles of dietary refrigerant than regular ones.
Response:  The supermarket had 30 regular bottles of soda and 8 diet sodas. Therefore, we have a total of 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of soda. Additionally, there were 41 apples. So, in total, we have 38 bottles of soda plus 41 apples, which equals 79 items.
Response:  The total number of garrafas of refrigerant is 79 + 53 = 132. Since there are more than 53 garrafes of regular refrigerant, we can say that the number of garrafas of regular refrigerant is greater than 53. So, the difference between the number of garrafas of regular and diet refrigerants is equal to 79 - 53 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more garrafas of regular refrigerant than diet refrigerant.
"Response:  The number of bottles of regular soda is 83, and the number of bottles of diet soda is 54. So we have:

Regular soda = 83 - 54 = 39

So there are 39 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 garrafas in total and 9 of them are regular refrigerant. So, we have 8 garrafas left (17 - 9 = 8). Now, out of these 8 garrafes, 5 are Diet refrigerants (since 50% of the remaining garrafes are Diet). Therefore, the number of Diet refrigerants is 5. 
So, the answer is 5."
Response:  The supermarket had 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles there were, we need to subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the number of regular soda bottles. So, if we subtract 19 from 60, we get 41. Therefore, there are 41 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles in the supermarket.
Response:  The supermarket had 72 regular refrigerants and 32 diet refrigerants, so they have in total 104 bottles of refrigerant (72 + 32 = 104). Now, we know that there were more than 78 apples because if it was only that amount, then the number of bottles would be equal to the number of apples plus the number of refrigerants. So, the difference between the number of bottles and the number of apples is the number of extra refrigerants they had. Therefore, the answer is 26 (104 - 78 = 26).
"Response:  The supermarket had 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles they had than apples, we need to subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles:

Total number of bottles = 80 + 54 = 134

So, the supermarket had 134 - 36 = 98 more bottles than apples."
Response:  We know that there are 30 garrafas in total and 28 of them are regular refrigerant. So, we have 28 x = number of Diet refrigerants. Since we know that the remaining 2 are not regular refrigerants, we can say that the number of Diet refrigerants is equal to 28 - 2 = 26. Therefore, there were 26 garrafas of Diet refrigerant.
Response:  If they had 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 bottles of regular soda more than the diet soda, then we can say that the number of regular soda bottles is equal to 83 - 4 = 79. So, there were 79 bottles of regular soda.
"Response:  The supermarket had 57 bottles of regular soda, 26 bottles of diet soda, and 27 bottles of light soda. So in total, we have:

Regular soda = 57 x 1 = 57 bottles
Diet soda = 26 x 1 = 26 bottles
Light soda = 27 x 1 = 27 bottles
Total number of bottles = 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles"
Response:  The total number of garrafas of refrigerant is 81 + 60 = 141. Now we know that there are more than 60 garrafes of regular refrigerant because if there were only 60, then all would be either regular or diet. Therefore, the number of garrafas of regular refrigerant is greater than 60 but less than 141. So, the answer is between 71 and 90 inclusive.
Response:  The supermarket had 49 bottles of regular soda, which means we have 49 x 1 = 49 bottles of regular soda in total. Then, it says that among these 49 bottles of regular soda, there were 40 bottles of diet soda. So, we subtract 40 from 49 to get the number of regular soda bottles left: 49 - 40 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 bottles of regular soda left. Now, let's check how many liters of each type of soda they had: Regular soda (9 bottles) x volume per bottle (355 ml): 9 x 355 = 3215 ml Total volume of regular soda = 3215 ml Diet soda (40 bottles) x volume per bottle (355 ml): 40 x 355 = 14200 ml Total volume of diet soda = 14200 ml Light soda (6 bottles) x volume per bottle (355 ml): 6 x 355 = 2190 ml Total volume of light soda = 2190 ml Now, let's calculate the total volume of all three types of soda together: Total volume of all soda = Volume of regular soda + Volume of diet soda + Volume of light soda = 3215 + 14200 + 2190 = 17505 ml Therefore, the answer is 17505 ml.
"Response:  If there were 317 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on that day and 295 visitors the day before, then we can write an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of visitors on the previous day (i.e., 295). Then, the number of visitors on the current day is equal to X + 317:

X + 317 = 317 + X

Now, let's solve for X:

X = 317 - 317

Therefore, there were 60 more visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on that day than there were the day before. So, the answer is 60."
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the palace yesterday and today there are 246 visitors, then in total there have been 949 visitors to the palace over the past 25 days (703 + 246 = 949).
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day before and after eating a healthy meal they went to see it, then the number of visitors that day is equal to the number of visitors the day before plus the number of people who visited after their meal. So if there were 666 visitors in total that day, then the number of visitors the previous day was 100, and the number of additional visitors after their meal was 566 (666 - 100). Therefore, the number of visitors to the Palace of Buckingham the day after they had a healthy meal was 666 + 566 = 1232 visitors.
"Response:  If 132 visitors came to the palace after eating a healthy meal, and there were 406 total visitors in the last 327 days, then we can calculate how many visitors came to the palace on the previous day as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors in the last 327 days / 327
= 406 / 327
= 1.25

So, approximately 1.25 visitors visited the palace on the previous day."
Response:  We know that after eating a healthy meal, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors had arrived at Buckingham Palace the day before. If 829 people visited Buckingham Palace in the last 85 days, how many visitors did Buckingham Palace receive on that particular day?
Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings in the palace after they had lunch. If we assume that each painting takes approximately 30 minutes to view (a rough estimate), then the total time taken to view all 71 paintings is 71 x 30 = 2130 minutes. Now, if 557 visitors came to the palace on the day after they had lunch, and assuming that the number of visitors per day has been constant, then the total number of visitors over the last 57 days would be 557 + (57 - 1) \* 188 = 557 + 964 = 1521. Therefore, the answer is 1521.
"Response:  If there were 39 paintings in the palace and 661 visitors came to the palace that day, then the number of visitors per painting is:

Number of visitors / Number of paintings = 661 / 39 = 17

So, 17 more visitors visited the palace on that day than the previous day (assuming there were 600 visitors the previous day)."
"Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham after lunch. If we add this number to the previous numbers given in the problem, we get:

* 419 + 103 + 92 = 614

So, before the day of the meal described in the problem, 614 people visited the Palace of Buckingham."
"Response:  If there were 512 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham on the day after they had a healthy meal, and if there were 471 visitors the day before that, then in total there would be:

512 + 471 = 983 visitors to the palace over the last two days.
If there were 808 visitors on the third day ago, then in total there would be:

983 + 808 = 1791 visitors to the palace over the last three days.
Therefore, there were 1791 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham in the last 89 days."
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to the Palace of Buckingham after they had a healthy meal. If we add this number to the previous numbers given in the problem (191 + 457 = 648), then we can see that there were 705 - 648 = 57 more visitors to the palace than in the 245 days before. So, the answer is 57.
Response:  We know that there are 159 grams of wax left to be added to the feathers. If the feathers require a total of 628 grams of wax, then we can calculate how much wax he already has by dividing the amount of wax remaining (159 grams) by the total amount required for all the feathers (628 grams). So, he already has 159/628 = 0.247 or approximately 24.7% of the total amount of wax needed.
Response:  The person needs 49 grams of colors to paint all the feathers. If each feather requires 288 grams of wax, and now he only needs 260 grams, then we can calculate how much wax he already has. So, he has 260 - 288 = -28 grams of wax left.
Response:  We know that the next person in line needs a total of 57g of colors to paint their feathers and requires an additional 22g of wax. If each feather requires 353g of wax, how many feathers does he already have? So, the answer is 353/22 = 16 feathers. Therefore, the person has 16 feathers.
"Response:  If he has 20 grams of wax and each feather requires 166 grams of wax, then we need to find out how many feathers he can make with the remaining amount of wax. So, we divide the total amount of wax (20 grams) by the required amount of wax per feather (166 grams):

Number of feathers = Total amount of wax / Required amount of wax per feather
= 20 grams / 166 grams
= 0.125 feathers
Therefore, he needs 0.125 more feathers to join all the pens."
Response:  We know that he has already used 557 grams of wax to attach the feathers and now he needs only 17 grams more. So, we can calculate the amount of wax required for each feather by dividing the remaining amount (17 grams) by the number of feathers (40). Therefore, each feather requires approximately 0.428 grams of wax (17 / 40 = 0.428).
Response:  We know that he has 11 grams of wax and the feathers require a total of 492 grams of wax. So we need to find out how many grams more than 11 grams he needs. To do this, we can subtract the amount of wax he already has from the total amount required: 492 - 11 = 481 grams. Therefore, he needs an additional 481 grams of wax.
Response:  If 94 wine tasters filled 90 barrels of grapes in 6 days, then they must have filled an average of 15 barrels per day (94 / 6 = 15).
Response:  The farmer had 266 customers who filled 90 barrels of grapes in 5 days. To find out how many barrels were filled per day, we can divide the total number of barrels by the number of days: 90 barrels / 5 days = 18 barrels per day.
"Response:  If they produce 244 barrels of grapes per day and work for 146 days, then in total they will have produced:

244 barrels/day x 146 days = 35,084 barrels
So, they would have filled 35,084 barrels with grapes during that period."
Response:  The farmer produces 221 barrels of grapes per day and needs to fill 100 barrels of frambuesas per day. So he has 121 extra barrels of grapes that he can use for other purposes or sell. If he sells them at $ 235 each, he will have earned $ 27,875 in revenue from those additional barrels. Therefore, his total income from both products would be $ 50,875 ($ 27,875 + $ 23,000).
Response:  If 252 pickers filled 108 barrels of grapes per day, then in 58 days they would fill 58 x 252 = 14644 barrels of grapes.
Response:  If they produce 8 barrels of grapes per day and there are 36 grape pickers, it means that each grape picker produces 8/36 = 1/4 barrel of grapes per day. Therefore, to fill 240 barrels of grapes, it will take them 240/1/4 = 60 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals as the total number of animals in all the aquariums. So, if we divide the total number of animals (52) by the number of aquariums (26), we get the average number of animals per aquarium:

$$ \frac{52}{26} = 3 $$

So, each aquarium has an average of 3 animals."
Response:  We know that there are 40 animals of saltwater in different aquariums. Since each aquarium has two animals, we can write an equation as follows: 40 / 2 = x, where x is the number of aquariums. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
"Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 39 animals, so we can write this as an equation: 
56 x 39 = 2174
Now, let's add up all the numbers of animals in both types of aquariums: 
56 x 39 + 10 x 39 = 2174 + 390 = 2564
So, Tyler has 2564 animals in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium has 46 animals, so we can write this down as follows:
Freshwater animals = 74 x 46 = 3380
Saltwater animals = 22 x 46 = 952
Now we need to find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has. So, we add up all the numbers of saltwater animals in each aquarium:
Tyler has 952 + 952 +... + 952 (since each aquarium has the same number of saltwater animals) = 952 x 10 = 9520 saltwater animals
Therefore, Tyler has 9520 saltwater animals."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 19 animals, so...

Step 1: Saltwater Animals - 15 x 19 = 285 animals
Step 2: Freshwater Animals - 62 x 19 = 1138 animals
Total number of animals = 285 + 1138 = 1423 animals
Therefore, he has 1423 animals in total."
"Response:  If we have 39 white shirts and each package contains 13 shirts, then...

$ $39 = 13 \times x $

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = 39 / 13 = 3 $

So, if the mother buys 39 white shirts, she will have 3 packages of them."
"Response:  If she buys 66 camisetas brancas and each package contains 3 camisetas brancas, then...

1. Divide 66 by 3 to find out how many packages she will have: 66 / 3 = 22

So, she will have 22 packages of white t-shirts."
"Response:  If there are 28 packages and each package contains 56 white shirts in total, then we can write an equation as follows: 

28 packets = 56 x (number of shirts per packet)

We know that the number of shirts per pack is not known, so we will use ""x"" to represent it. Therefore, we have:

28 packets = 56x

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 56 to solve for ""x"":

28 / 56 = x

So, each package contains 14 white shirts (56 / 4)."
Response:  If she buys 57 packages of white shirts and each package contains 53 shirts, then she will have in total... (57 x 53 = 2910)...shirts!
Response:  If she buys 51 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 shirts, then... (51 / 3 =) How many packages will she have? That is, she will have 17 packages of T-shirts!
Response:  If the mother buys 70 white T-shirts in total and she buys 14 packages of T-shirts, then each package contains how many white T-shirts? We can write an equation based on this information: Number of T-shirts in a package = Total number of T-shirts / Number of packages So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of T-shirts in a package = 70 / 14 = 5 Therefore, each package contains 5 white T-shirts.
Response:  If we have 4 bags with the same number of cookies and there are 36 cookies in total, then each bag has 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  If I have 33 biscuits and each bag has 11 biscuits, then... (1)...I will have 33 / 11 = 3 bags of biscuits. So, I will have 3 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If each sack has 41 biscuits and you have 53 sacks of biscuits, then... (1) The total number of biscuits in all the sacks is equal to the product of the number of sacks and the number of biscuits in each sack. So we can write: Total Number of Biscuits = Number of Sacks x Number of Biscuits per Sack. (2) Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total Number of Biscuits = 53 x 41 = 2193. Therefore, you have 2193 biscuits.
Response:  If we have 14 bolinhos in total and 7 sacos with the same number of bolinhos, then each saco has 14/7 = 2 bolinhos. Therefore, each saco has 2 bolinhos.
"Response:  If each sack contains 3 biscuits and you have 21 biscuits in total, then...

Step 1: How many biscuits are in one sack?
Answer: Each sack contains 3 biscuits.

Step 2: How many sacks do you have in total?
Answer: You have 21 biscuits in total, which means you can divide them equally among x sacks.

Step 3: How many biscuits are in each sack?
Answer: Since there are 21 biscuits in total and you want to divide them equally among x sacks, each sack must contain 21/x biscuits.

So, if you want to find out how many sacks you have, you need to solve for x:

x = 21 / 3 = 7

Therefore, you have 7 sacks of biscuits."
Response:  We know that we have 15 doces and 52 biscoitos in total. If each saco contains the same number of bolachas (which is not specified), then we can assume that each sack contains an equal number of doces and biscoitos as well. Therefore, if we divide the total number of doces (15) by the number of sacos with doces ( unknown), we get the number of sacos with doces: 15 / x = 15/x. Similarly, if we divide the total number of biscoitos (52) by the number of sacos with biscoitos (unknown), we get the number of sacos with biscoitos: 52 / y = 52/y. Since we are asked how many sacos of biscuits we would have, we need to find out what value of y satisfies this equation: 52 / y = Number of sacos of biscuits. Solving for y, we get y = 4. So, we would have 4 sacos of biscuits.
Response:  If we have 28 biscuits and 86 sweets in total, that means we have 86 - 28 = 58 sweets left over after giving out all the biscuits. Since each bag can hold the same number of sweets, we will divide these remaining sweets equally among the bags, so we will have 58 / 14 = 4 bags of sweets. Therefore, you would have 4 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If there are $n$ houses in a quarter, and the mailman has to deliver $k$ cards per house, then he will have to deliver $\frac{kn}{4}$ cards in total. Since each card represents one-fourth of a house, the number of cards delivered is equal to the number of houses in the quarter divided by four. Therefore, if there are $n$ houses in a quarter, the mailman will deliver $\frac{kn}{4}$ cards in total.
Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each quarter, and the garbage collector needs to deliver 9 cards of trash to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 180 cards (20 x 9 = 180).
Response:  Since there are six houses in the quarter, and each house receives 24 trash bags per day, then the total number of trash bags that need to be delivered to all the houses is 6 x 24 = 144 trash bags per day.
Response:  If there are x houses in each quarter, and the mailman delivers 14 pieces of trash to each house, then he will deliver a total of 14x pieces of trash to all the houses in one quarter. Since he also has to deliver 2 pieces of mail for each quarter, he will have to make a total of 14x + 2 trips to deliver all the trash and mail. So, we can set up an equation as follows: 14x = 2(number of quarters) where number of quarters is equal to the number of houses per quarter times the number of quarters. Solving for x, we get x = 60. Therefore, there are 60 houses in each quarter.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each quarter and the garbage man has to deliver 32 trash cans to each house, then he will have to deliver a total of 640 trash cans (20 x 32 = 640). So, the answer is 640 trash cans.
Response:  The total number of houses in all quarteirões is $78 \times 4 = 312$. Since there are $19$ houses per quarteirão, the total number of houses in one quarteirão is $312 / 19 = 16$. So, the carter needs to deliver $30 \div 16 = 1 \text{ card}$ to each house. Therefore, he will need to deliver $1 \times 312 = 312$ cards in total.
Response:  If there are $n$ houses in each quarter, and the garbage collector delivers $k$ cards to each house, then the total number of cards delivered is $\text{Total} = k \times n$. Since there are $55$ quarter...
Response:  Since there are 81 quarters and each quarter has 12 houses, the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 960 houses. So, the carrier needs to deliver 4 cards per house, which means he needs to deliver 960 x 4 = 3840 cards in total.
"Response:  Since there are 17 houses in each quarter, and the mail carrier has to deliver 4 pieces of trash to each house, the number of pieces of trash he needs to deliver is:

17 x 4 = 68

So, the mail carrier needs to deliver 68 pieces of trash in total."
"Response:  We have 10 eggs and 20 balls. To divide them into groups of 4, we need to find out how many times 4 goes into 30 (the total number of eggs + balls).

4 goes into 30 exactly 7 times. So, we can create 7 groups of 4 balls each. Therefore, the answer is 7."
"Response:  We have to divide 15 eggs into groups of 5. To do this, we need to find out how many times 15 can be divided by 5. 

15 / 5 = 3
So, we will create 3 groups of 5 eggs each. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response:  If we have a collection of eggs and want to divide them into groups of 11 with each group containing 2 eggs, then the total number of eggs is:

Number of eggs = Total number of groups x Number of eggs in each group
= 11 x 2
= 22

So, Rebecca has 22 eggs."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 balls. If she wants to divide them into 4 groups, each group will have how many eggs? To find out, we can use division. So, let's divide 8 (the number of eggs) by 4 (the number of groups): 8 / 4 = 2. Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 bowls and 15 eggs. If we divide them equally among the four bowls, each bowl will have 3-15/4 = 3-3.75 eggs. So, each group of eggs will have approximately 3 to 4 eggs.
Response:  We have to divide the total number of eggs among groups of 6. So we will divide 18 eggs into groups of 6. How many groups can be created this way? The answer is 3. Therefore, there will be 3 groups of eggs.
Response:  We have to divide the total number of objects into groups of 3. So we will divide 99 + 9 + 27 = 155 objects into groups of 3. Therefore, there will be 155 / 3 = 51 groups created.
Response:  If we divide the eggs into groups of 5, then each group will have 5 eggs and 1 boling (since there are 6 bolinhas). So, if we divide all the eggs equally among the 6 bolinhas, each bolinha will get 3/6 = 1/2 egg. Therefore, Rebecca has 20 - 10 = 10 more eggs than bolinhas.
Response:  If we divide the eggs into groups of 20, then each group will have 20/5 = 4 eggs. So, Rebecca has 12 - 4 = 8 more eggs than bolts. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and gained 11 points in each round, then he played ${{154}} / {{11}} = 14$ rounds.
Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of a game of trivia and won 46 points in each round, then he scored a total of 177 x 46 = 8320 points in the game.
"Response:  If Luke marked 84 points after playing two rounds of a trivia game and he won the same number of points in each round, then we can write an equation as follows:

Luke scored x points in Round 1 + Luke scored x points in Round 2 = 84

Since Luke scored the same number of points in both rounds, we can simplify the equation to:

x + x = 84

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 84

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 42

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points in each round."
Response:  If Luke won 146 points in each round of a game, then he scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,392 points in the entire game.
"Response:  If Luke won 3 points in each round and scored 78 points overall, then he must have played x rounds. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Luke scored 78 points = x \* 3 points/round

Now we need to solve for x, which represents the number of rounds Luke played. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 78 / 3

So Luke played 26 rounds (x = 26)."
Response:  If Emily had 2 accounts and made 32 braids, each braid needed how many accounts? To find out, we need to divide the number of braids (32) by the number of accounts (2). So, each account was used to make 16 braids.
Response:  If Emily made 11 collars and each collar has 28 accounts, then she had to make a total of 28 x 11 = 308 accounts. So, the answer is 308.
Response:  If Emily has 16 contas and each collar has 8 contas, then she can make 2 (16 / 8 = 2) collars.
Response:  If Emily made 18 collars and had 6 accounts, then each collar needed 3 accounts to complete it (since 18 / 6 = 3). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Emily made 4 collars and each collar has 5 accounts, then the total number of accounts is 4 x 5 = 20. So, Emily had 20 accounts in total.
Response:  If Emily has 6 accounts and each bracelet requires 3 accounts, then she can make 6 x 3 = 18 bracelets.
Response:  If Emily has 5 accounts and can make 20 bracelets with each account, then she needs to make 20/5 = 4 bracelets per account. Therefore, she needs 4 x 43 = 172 bracelets in total.
Response:  If Emily has made 26 collars and each collar requires 2 accounts, then she needs to make 13 accounts in total (26 / 2 = 13). So, Emily had 13 accounts in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children in the county and 668278 of them stay at home during summer vacation. So, we have to find out how many more children went to camp compared to those who stayed at home. To do this, we can divide the number of children who went to camp (819058) by the total number of children (819058 + 668278 = 1487836). This gives us a ratio of 57.6% of children who went to camp compared to those who stayed at home.
Response:  We know that there are 100,000 children in total (40,000 + 30,000 + 30,000). Since 20,000 children went to camp, we have 80,000 left behind. So, the number of children who stayed at home is 80,000 - 20,000 = 60,000. Therefore, 60,000 more children stayed at home than went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in the county of Lawrence. During the summer vacation, 629,424 children go to camp and the remaining stay at home. So, we need to find out how many children stay at home. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of children staying at home = 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627. Therefore, 268,627 children stay at home during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313.473 children in the county and during summer vacation 274.865 stay at home. So, we have to find out how many go to camp. To do this, we can divide the number of children who don't stay at home (274.865) by the total number of children (313.473). This gives us approximately 0.86 or 86%. Therefore, about 86% of the children in the county go to camp during summer vacation.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 907611 children in the County of Lawrence who stay at home during the summer holidays. On the other hand, we know that 455682 of these children go to camp. Therefore, the number of children who go to camp is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who stay at home. So, the answer is:

Number of children who go to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stay at home
= 907611 - 455682
= 451939
Therefore, there are 451939 children who go to camp from the County of Lawrence during the summer holidays."
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 8000 children from Lawrence County go to camp and the remaining stay at home. The total number of children in Lawrence County is 828521. So, the number of children who stayed at home can be calculated as follows: Number of children who went to camp = 8000 Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp = 828521 - 8000 = 748521 Therefore, 748521 children stayed at home.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 61619 children from County of Lawrence stayed at home and the rest went to camp. The total number of children in the County of Lawrence is 91676. So, we can calculate the number of children who went to camp as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, 30057 children from the County of Lawrence went to the camp.
Response:  We know that in total there are 34044 children from Lawrence County who go to camp and 13486 children who stay at home. Additionally, 424944 children from outside the county participated in the camp. So, we can write an equation: Total number of children = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside the county. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of children = 34044 + 424944 = 458388. Therefore, the number of children who participated in the camp is 458388.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:

* 610769 children from Lawrence County go to camp during summer vacation.
* 590796 children stay at home in Lawrence County.
* 22 children are from outside the county and participated in the camp.

So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is:

610769 + 590796 = 1201565

Therefore, there are approximately 1.2 million children in Lawrence County."
"Response:  We know that there are 644997 children in the county and 893835 of them went to camp. So, the number of children who stayed at home is:
644997 - 893835 = 555062
Therefore, there are 555062 children in the County of Lawrence."
Response:  If Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total, then Jackie must have 6 apples (since 9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the difference between Adam's apples (10) and Jackie's apples (2) is 8. Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  If Adam has 9 maçãs and Jackie has 10 maçãs, then Jackie has 1 more maçã than Adam. So, the difference between the number of maçãs that Jackie has and the number of maçãs that Adam has is equal to 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:

10 - 8 = 2

So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam."
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. If they had 4 more apples than each other, then Adam has x apples and Jackie has x + 4 apples. Since we want to find out how many apples Adam has, we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + (x + 4) = 6
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 4 = 6
Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 2
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 1
So, Adam has 1 apple and Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples."
Response:  If there are 9 apples in total and Adam has 4 of them, then he has 4/9 = 1/3 of all the apples. Similarly, if Jackie has 5 apples, she has 5/9 = 1/6 of all the apples. So, the remaining 9 - (1/3 + 1/6) = 9 - 2/3 = 4/3 of the apples are left. Therefore, there are 4/3 = 2 apples left.
Response:  We know that together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. And we also know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has 8 + x apples. Now, we are told that Adam and Jackie combined have 9 more apples than they have individually. This means that the total number of apples is 12 (Adam and Jackie combined) - (Adam + Jackie) = 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Jackie has 3 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie and together they have 2 apples less than six additional apples. So, if we add up all these information, we can conclude that Adam has 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie and Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples. So, if we add 5 to 89, we get 94. And if we subtract 11 from 94, we get 83. Therefore, Adam has 83 apples.
Response:  We know that Helen made 31 biscuits yesterday, and then she made 270 today. So, in total, Helen made 31 + 270 = 291 biscuits until last night.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 90 chocolate cookies. Today, she made 51 chocolate chip cookies and 484 chocolate cookies in total. So, the total number of chocolate cookies Helen made is: 90 + 51 + 484 = 625. Therefore, Helen made 625 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 527 chocolate cookies and 86 raisin cookies. Today, she made 86 raisin cookies and 554 chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen made 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies.
"Response:  We know that in total, Helen made 144 + 397 = 541 biscuits of chocolate and raisins yesterday. And today she made 85 + 403 = 488 biscuits of chocolate and raisins. So, if we subtract the number of biscuits she made yesterday from the number she made today, we get:

488 - 541 = -63

So, Helen made -63 biscuits of raisins today."
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 19 chocolate cookies and today she made 231 chocolate cookies + 237 chocolate cookies = 468 chocolate cookies in total. So, Helen made more than twice as many chocolate cookies as she did passover cookies (231 + 237 = 478). Therefore, the answer is 478.
Response:  On yesterday (Tuesday), Helen made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 raisin cookies. Today is Wednesday, so she made more cookies. Specifically, she made 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate cookies today. So, to find out how many more chocolate cookies Helen made on Tuesday compared to today, we can subtract the number of chocolate cookies she made today from the number she made yesterday: 66 - 46 = 20. Therefore, Helen made 20 more chocolate cookies on Tuesday than she did today.
Response:  On Tuesday (yesterday), Helen made 280 biscuits of raisins and 359 biscuits of chocolate, so she made a total of 640 biscuits (280 + 359). Today, she made 300 biscuits of raisins and 519 biscuits of chocolate, so she made a total of 819 biscuits (300 + 519). Therefore, Helen made 279 more biscuits of raisins yesterday compared to today (819 - 640 = 279).
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So we can write this as an equation: 81 = x + y, where x is the number of games her friends have and y is the difference between Katie's number of games and her friend's number of games. Now we are asked to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. To do this, we need to subtract y from both sides of the equation: 81 - y = x + y. Solving for y, we get y = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So, in total, Katie has 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games her old friends have. According to the question, they have 53 games. Therefore, the number of games that Katie's friends have is 179 - 53 = 126 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and 86 old games, so together she has 164 games (78 + 86). Now we are told that her friends have 48 new games. So, altogether they have 48 + 48 = 96 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19). Now we are told that her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69). Therefore, together Katie and her friends have 180 games (103 + 77).
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So, in total, they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  If the friends have 57 games and Katie has 63 games, then we can say that Katie has 63 - 57 = 6 more games than her friends. So, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Now we are told that her friends have 34 new games. So, if we subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of new games Katie has, we get: 96 - 34 = 62. Therefore, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that at the end of last week, Jason had $19 and Fred had $60. Then, he earned $33 from washing cars. So, now Jason has $33 + $19 = $52.
Response:  The total amount of money that Fred had last week was $86 + $5 = $91. Now, since Fred earned $9 and Jason didn't work, Jason still has $5. So, together they have $91 + $5 = $96.
Response:  The total amount of money that both boys had before was $35 (19 + 16). After they washed cars, Fred gained $21 ($40 - $19) and Jason gained $43 ($69 - $26). So, Fred gained $21 more than Jason. Therefore, Fred gained $64 in total ($21 + $43).
"Response:  We know that at the beginning of last week, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. After washing cars, Fred now has $21 and Jason has $78. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:
Fred's money before = $114
Jason's money before = $22
New amount of Fred's money = $21
New amount of Jason's money = $78
Now, let's solve for the increase in Jason's money:
Increase in Jason's money = New amount of Jason's money - Original amount of Jason's money
= $78 - $22
= $56
Therefore, Jason made $56 during the weekend."
Response:  The total amount of money that Fred had before he started washing cars is $111 + $40 = $151. After he finished washing cars, his new balance became $115. So, the amount of money he gained from washing cars is $151 - $115 = $36.
Response:  The total amount of money that Jason had before delivering newspapers was $3 + $63 = $66. Since he delivered newspapers and earned $66, his new balance is $66 + $63 = $129. So, Jason gained $129 by delivering newspapers.
Response:  The total amount of money that Jason had before he started delivering newspapers was $31 + $14 = $45. Since then, he has earned $14 more, so his new total is $45 + $14 = $59.
Response:  The total amount of money that Fred had at the beginning of the week is $33 + $95 = $128. Then, he earned $16 from delivering newspapers and $74 from washing cars, so his new total amount of money is $128 + $16 + $74 = $208. Therefore, the Fred gained $80 during the weekend ($208 - $128).
Response:  The total amount of money that Fred had before he started working is $47 + $99 = $146. Then, during the weekend, he earned $111 from delivering newspapers and $34 from washing cars, so his new total amount of money is $146 + $111 + $34 = $281. Therefore, Fred has $281 now.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 71 kg (pesava). After losing 20 kilograms, she now weighs... (agora) 51 kg!
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 27 kilograms (kg). After running every day, she lost 101 kg. So, her current weight is 27 + 101 = 128 kg.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 192 kg (66 + 126 = 192). So, she lost 126 kilograms after running every day.
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running for some time, she lost 35 kg. So, her current weight is:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg."
"Response:  At first, Jessie weighed 114 kg. Then, she lost 50 kg in the first week and another 60 kg in the second week. So, after two weeks of running every day, Jessie now weighs:

114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg
64 kg - 60 kg = 4 kg
Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 4 kg."
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kilograms (A). After one week of running, she lost 62 kilograms (B), so her new weight is: B - A = 62 kg - 9 kg = 53 kg. Then after another week of running, she lost an additional 140 kilograms (C), so her final weight is: C - B = 140 kg - 53 kg = 87 kg. Therefore, before starting to run, Jessie weighed 87 kilograms.
Response:  After Jessie started running every day, he lost 56 kg in the first week and 99 kg in the second week. So, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed less than 92 kg (his initial weight). We can assume that his new weight is x kg. Therefore, we have the equation: 92 - 56 = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 36 kg. So, after the first week of running, Jessie weighed 36 kg less than his initial weight of 92 kg.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in total (including both cobras and anacondas). If 64 of them are not hidden, then the number of hidden ones is equal to 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, 31 cobras are hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 93 cobras and 97 jacaré in total. If 40 of them are hidden, then we have to subtract this number from the total amount of jacarés. So, the number of jacarés not hidden is: 97 - 40 = 57.
Response:  We know that in total there are 3 cobras and 75 jacaré in the zoo. If we add 82 cobras and 19 jacares to this number, we get: 3 + 75 = 78. So, among the jacares, 75 - 19 = 56 are not hidden.
"Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the enclosure and we also know that 24 of them are cobras. So, if we subtract the number of cobras from the total number of animals, we get:

Total number of animals = 79 - 24 = 55

Therefore, 55 animals are not hidden (i.e., they are visible)."
"Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden initially. If he chose 134 of them yesterday and 30 today, then the number of tomatoes left after today is:

Initial tomatoes = 171
Chosen yesterday = 134
Chosen today = 30
Total chosen = 164 (134 + 30)
Remaining tomatoes = Initial tomatoes - Total chosen = 171 - 164 = 7
Therefore, there will be 7 tomatoes remaining after today."
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden to start with. If he chose 56 of them yesterday and 41 today, then he has 63 tomatoes left after yesterday's harvest (160 - 56 = 63).
"Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden initially. If he chose 154 of them yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he picked is:

90 + (154 - 90) = 264

So, the farmer picked 264 tomatoes in total."
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 batatas in his garden. If he collected 172 batatas, then he has 3 batatas left (175 - 172 = 3). As for the tomatoes, since he did not collect any, he still has all 175 tomatoes. So, the farmer now has 175 tomatoes and 3 batatas left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 53 tomatoes, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he gathered 12 batatas, then he has 12 - 12 = 0 batatas left. So, the farmer now has 124 tomatoes and 0 batatas in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, for a total of 176 tomatoes (105 + 71). If he collected 137 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes left is equal to the initial amount minus the collected one: 176 - 137 = 39. So, there are 39 tomatoes remaining in the farmer's garden.
Response:  If he used 4 screws to cut big pieces of wood for the walls, and each piece needs 2 screws to be attached, then John needs 8 screws (4 x 2 = 8) to attach all the pieces together. So, John needs 8 tábuas (pieces of wood).
Response:  The total number of tábuas required for the house is 13 (given in the problem). Each tábua requires 17 pregos to be fixed (also given in the problem). Therefore, the total number of pregos needed for all the tábuas = 13 x 17 = 201 pregos. However, there are also some smaller tábuas that require 8 pregos each. So, the additional number of pregos needed = 8 x however many small tables there are = 8 x X, where X is the number of small tables. Since we don't know how many small tables there are, we can't determine the final answer yet.
Response:  We know that John used 11 screws in total to cut big pieces of wood for the house walls. If each piece needs 3 screws to be fixed, then he has used 3 x 11 = 33 screws so far. But we were told that he used 8 additional screws. So, the total number of screws John used is 33 + 8 = 41 screws. Therefore, John needs 41/3 = 13 tábuas (or planks) to finish the wall.
Response:  The total number of tábuas required for the wall is 22 (12 large + 10 small). Since large tables require 15 screws and small tables require 5 screws, we can say that the total number of screws needed = 15 + 5 = 20. Therefore, John needs 20 screws to fix the walls of the house.
Response:  We know that each tábua needs 2 pedaços of screws to be fixed and we will use 16 tábuas for the whole house. So, the total number of screws needed is: 16 x 2 = 32 screws.
Response:  If he needs 74 screws for each of the 8 big wooden boards, then he will need in total... 74 x 8 = 592 screws. So John needs 592 screws to attach the walls of his house.
Response:  The total number of tábuas required for the wall is given as 12 tábuas grandes and 17 tábuas pequenas = 39 tábuas. Since each tábua grande requires 14 pregos and each tábua pequena requires 25 pregos, we need to calculate the total number of pregos needed. For the large tables, it will be 12 x 14 = 168 pregos. For the small tables, it will be 17 x 25 = 425 pregos. Therefore, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 pregos in total to fix the walls.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of elastic in each package and a total of 42 pieces of elastic. So, if we divide the number of pieces of elastic (42) by the number of packages (x), we get x = 14. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of elastic.
Response:  The total number of chicles = Total number of packages x Number of pieces in each package + Extra chicles. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chicles = 43 Pacotes x 23 Peças/Pacote + 8 Chicles Extras. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Chicles = 43 x 23 + 8 = 1056. Therefore, the Robin has 1056 chicles.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each package and the Robin has 6 extra pieces. So, if we multiply the number of packages by the number of pieces per package, we get: Number of packages = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package  Number of packages = 41 / 7  Number of packages = 6
So, the Robin has 6 packages of gum."
Response:  The total number of packages is 28 + 13 = 41. Since each package has 4 pieces of candy, the total number of candies is 41 x 4 = 164. Therefore, the robin has 164 chocolates.
Response:  We know that there are 21 packages of pills and each package has 9 pieces. So we have 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of pills in total. Now, we also know that there are 45 packages of candies and each package has 9 pieces. Therefore, we have 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy in total. Since the total number of pieces is equal to the sum of the number of pills and the number of candies, we can conclude that the Robin has 189 + 405 = 594 pieces of sweets.
Response:  The total number of packages is 28 + 14 = 42 packages. Since each package has 6 pieces, the total number of pieces is 42 x 6 = 252 pieces. So, there are 252 pieces in total.
"Response:  If the machine can make 3 camisas per minute and it made 6 camisas in total, then we need to divide the number of camisas made by the time taken to make each camisas. So, the answer is:
Minutes = Number of camisas / Time taken to make one camisas
= 6 camisas / 3 camisas/minute
= 2 minutes
Therefore, the machine functioned for 2 minutes."
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes, so it produced 5 x 4 = 20 camisas during that time.
Response:  On yesterday, the machine made 9 camisas in total. So, if it can make 3 camisas per minute, then it worked for... (3 x 9) = 27 minutes on yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in total. If it can make 8 shirts per minute, then it worked for... (13 / 8) = 15 minutes yesterday. Today, the machine made 3 shirts. So, in total, the machine worked for... (15 + 3) = 18 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 camisas in total. So, if it can make 2 camisas per minute, then it worked for... (9 / 2) = 4.5 minutes yesterday. Now, today it made 8 camisas. If it works at the same rate as yesterday, then it will work for... (8 / 2) = 4 minutes today. Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 4.5 + 4 = 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  The machine can make 3 shirts per minute, so in one hour it will make 60 shirts (3 x 20). If it made 4 shirts yesterday and 8 today, then in total it has worked for 60 + 8 = 68 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced 6 camisas per minute, so it produced 72 camisas (12 x 6). Today, the machine worked for 14 minutes and also produced 6 camisas per minute, so it produced 84 camisas (14 x 6). Therefore, in total, the machine produced 156 camisas (72 + 84).
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made x camisas in 5 minutes = 30 camisas/minute (since it can make 6 camisas per minute). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and made y camisas = 72 camisas/minute (since it can make 6 camisas per minute). Now we have two equations: 30x + 72y = 180 (from yesterday) and 30x + 72y = 120 (from today). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 40 and y = 90. So, the machine made 40 camisas yesterday and 90 camisas today. Therefore, the total number of camisas made by the machine today is 90 + 40 = 130 camisas.
Response:  If they gained $165 in 5 days, that means they gained $33 per day. So, they gained $33 per day.
"Response:  The game of ring toss at the carnival earned $144 per day. They were there for 22 days. So, how much money did they make in total?

Step-by-step calculation:

$144 (per day) x 22 (days) = $3,068

Therefore, the total amount of money made by the game of ring toss at the carnival is $3,068."
Response:  The group gained $420 in 30 days playing the game of ring toss at Carnival, and they also won $22 in addition to that. So, how much did they win per day on average? To find out, we can divide the total amount they won by the number of days they played: $420 / 30 = $14 per day. Therefore, the group won $14 per day playing the game of ring toss at Carnival.
Response:  The game made $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. So, if we add both amounts together, we get: $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, they earned $756 in total.
Response:  The total amount earned in the first 20 days of the carnival is $120, and in the remaining 16 days it was $66, for a total of $186. So, if we divide this amount by the number of days (46), we get: $186 / 46 = $4.07 per day.
"Response:  The total amount earned in the first 154 days was $325, and in the remaining 57 days it was $114. So, we can write this as:

Total earnings = $325 + $114 = $439

Now, to find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total earnings by the number of days left:

Earnings per day = Total earnings / Number of days left
= $439 / 57
= $7.80

Therefore, the group earned $7.80 per day during the last 57 days of the carnival."
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packages of cookies and 4 packages of cake, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages of sweets. So, she bought 14 more packages of cookies than she did of cake.
Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 4 packages of crackers, which means she bought 4 x 22 = 88 packets of crackers. Additionally, she bought 20 packages of cake (not 16), so that's another 20 x 22 = 440 packets of cake. Finally, she bought 16 packages of chocolate, for a total of 16 x 22 = 352 packets of chocolate. Therefore, in total, Lucy bought 88 + 440 + 352 = 970 packets of food at the store.
"Response:  According to the question, Lucy bought 23 packages of crackers and some packages of cake. So she had a total of 27 packages of purchases. Since we know that each package of cake contains 4-6 pieces, let's assume that Lucy bought x packages of cake. Therefore, the number of pieces of cake that Lucy bought is equal to x times 4 or 6. 
So, the answer is 4x or 6x."
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packages of cookies and 12 packages of candy, then she had 2 + 12 = 14 packages in total. Since she had 56 coins as change, this means that each package cost approximately 56 / 14 = $3.86. So, Lucy bought 14 packages of goods.
Response:  In the first stop, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people entered the bus at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus.
Response:  In the first stop, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people entered and 3 people left, so the new number of people in the bus is: 8 + 12 - 3 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 people in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people entered the bus. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
"Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people entered the train, so the total number of people now is:

11 + 8 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 people in the train now."
Response:  We know that there were 22 people in the program and 676 people in total. So, we can calculate the number of students who were not part of the program as follows: Number of students = Total number of people - Number of people in the program = 676 - 22 = 654 Therefore, there were 654 students who were not part of the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 people in the program (pais). Then, we have to add the number of students and teachers. So, the total number of people present is: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531. Therefore, there were 1531 people present in the program.
"Response:  If there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students also attended, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Number of students more than parents = 521 - 174 = 347

Therefore, there were 347 more students than parents in the program."
"Response:  We know that there were 61 people in the program and 177 students also attended. The program could accommodate 44 people. So, we need to find out how many people are more than the capacity of the program.

$ Number of extra people = Total number of attendees - Capacity $
= 177 - 44
= 133

Therefore, there were 133 extra people beyond the capacity of the program."
"Response:  The distance from the bottom of the cave to the end is given as $1307$ feet. Since they are already at a depth of $919$ feet in the cave, we need to find out how far they have to travel upwards to reach the end. So, the distance between their current position and the end of the cave is:

$$ Distance = 1307 - 919 = 388 $$

Therefore, the distance from the bottom of the cave to the end is $388$ feet."
Response:  The distance traveled so far is given as $849$ feet, and they are traveling at a speed of $17$ kilometers per hour. To find out how many hours it will take to reach the end of the cave, we can divide the distance left to cover by their speed: $$ \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Distance left}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1218}{17} = 73.5 \text{ hours} $$ So, it will take them approximately $73.5$ hours to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  If they are currently at 659 feet and the cave has a depth of 762 feet, then they have already traveled 106 feet (762 - 659 = 103). So, to find out how much more time it will take them to reach the end of the cave, we can divide the remaining distance (103 feet) by their current speed (659 feet per hour): Time = Distance / Speed = 103 ft / 659 ft/h = 0.16 hours or 10 minutes. Therefore, they will need an additional 10 minutes to reach the end of the cave.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 8 golden fish in the lake and then 6 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, the number of golden fish left after the cats ate some is:

8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, 2 golden fish disappeared or were eaten by the stray cats."
"Response:  According to the problem, Paige created 7 golden fish and 12 carp in the lake. If the stray cats loved to eat them, then after 15 years, how many fish would be left? We can calculate this as follows:

* After 1 year, 7 + 12 = 19 fish (since all the cats love to eat them)
* After 2 years, 19 - 7 = 12 fish (since some of the cats might have stopped eating them)
* After 3 years, 12 - 4 = 8 fish (since more cats might have started eating them)
* After 4 years, 8 - 2 = 6 fish (since even more cats might have started eating them)
* After 5 years, 6 - 1 = 5 fish (since only one cat is left)
* After 15 years, 0 fish (since all the fish were eaten by the cats)

Therefore, after 15 years, none of the original 7 golden fish or 12 carp remain in the lake. So, the answer is 0."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Paige created 16 goldfish and 71 cats in the lake. However, the stray cats were eating them all up. Now she has two goldfish left. So, we can deduce that 89 fish (16 - 2) disappeared due to the cat's feeding habits.
Response:  If Paige created 15 goldfish in the lake and five were eaten by stray cats, then there are 10 goldfish left (15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and after making some tarts he had 2 apples left. So, he used 41 apples to make the tarts.
"Response:  The chef had initially 58 apples and made some tarts using 35 of them. So, how many apples are left? We can calculate it as follows:

Initial number of apples = 58
Number of apples used for tarts = 35

Now, let's subtract the number of apples used from the initial number to find out how many apples are left:

Number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples used
= 58 - 35
= 23

Therefore, there were 23 apples left after the chef made the tarts."
Response:  The chef had 40 apples and 54 peaches to start with. If he made some tarts and ended up with 39 apples left, then he must have used 1 apple in his tarts. So, the answer is 1.
"Response:  Since there are 4 prateleiras in Adam's room and he can place 11 figures of action in each shelf, then we have:
Number of figures that can be placed in each shelf = 11
Total number of figures that can be placed in all the shelves = Number of shelves x Number of figures per shelf
= 4 x 11
= 44
Therefore, Adam could store 44 figures of action in his room."
Response:  If Adam has 10 figures of action in each shelf and his room can hold 8 shelves, then he has a total of 10 x 8 = 80 figures of action in his room.
"Response:  Since there are 4 prateleiras in Adam's room and he can place 8 figures of action and 10 closets in each shelf, then we have:
Number of figures of action that can be placed = 4 x 8 = 32
Number of closets that can be placed = 4 x 10 = 40
Therefore, the total number of things that can be stored in Adam's room is:
Total number of things = Number of figures of action + Number of closets = 32 + 40 = 72"
"Response:  We have:
Number of gardens = 10
Number of vases in each garden = 544
Number of flowers in each pot = 32
Total number of flowers = Total number of vases x Number of flowers in each pot
= 544 x 32
= 17,680
Therefore, there are 17,680 flowers in total."
Response:  We have 466 pots and each pot has 53 flowers. Therefore, we have 466 x 53 = 24,798 flowers in total. Now, let's count the sticks. Each flower has 181 sticks, so we have 24,798 x 181 = 4,409,320 sticks in total.
Response:  We have 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers. Therefore, we have 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers and there are 400 flowers in total. So, we can calculate the number of pots as follows: Number of pots = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot = 400 / 40 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 pots in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steve's collection and 4276 drinks. If we organize them into groups of 154, then each group will have how many items?

We can start by dividing the total number of items (Skittles + drinks) by 154:

4502 + 4276 = 8778

So, if we divide 8778 by 154, we get:

8778 / 154 = 57

Therefore, each group will contain 57 items (Skittles or drinks)."
Response:  Since there are 3941 Skittles in Steve's collection and he also has 4950 bottles of water, we can say that each group of water will contain 495/3941 = 0.127 groups of water. So, if we organize the 4950 bottles of water into groups of size 0.127, then each group will contain 4950 / 0.127 = 3860 bottles of water.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steve's collection and he also has 517 bottles of water and 90 scales. If we organize the Skittles into groups of equal size, each group will have to contain at least one Skittle from each of the 8 colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and black). Therefore, the number of Skittles in each group must be a multiple of 8. Since there are 896 Skittles in total, the smallest possible value for the number of Skittles in each group is 896 / 8 = 112. So, each group contains 112 Skittles.
Response:  Since there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, we can say that there are 270 / 5 = 54 classes. So, there are 54 grades in total.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of students = 304 x 75 = 22,550 students. Therefore, there were 22,550 students in total.
