"Response:  If 3 pages of a homework are equivalent to 10% of the total homework, then how many pages would be equivalent to 30% of the total homework?

Answer: To find out how many pages would be equivalent to 30% of the total homework, we can use the same proportion as before. Let's say the total number of pages in the homework is x. Then, we know that 3 pages are equal to 10% of the total, so:

3 = 0.1x

Now, we want to find out how many pages are equal to 30% of the total. We can multiply the previous equation by 3 to get:

9 = 0.3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30

So, there are 30 pages in the total homework. Therefore, 30% of the total homework is equivalent to 30 pages."

"Response:  The number of cups of sugar needed to make 14 cups of tea with 6 cups of water and 5 cups of milk is calculated as follows:

14 cups of tea x 2 cups of sugar per cup of tea = 28 cups of sugar

Since 5 cups of milk are used for every 6 cups of water, we need to add an additional 5 cups of sugar to account for the milk. Therefore, the total amount of sugar needed is:

28 cups of sugar + 5 cups of sugar = 33 cups of sugar

So, to make 14 cups of tea with 6 cups of water and 5 cups of milk, you will need 33 cups of sugar."

where $\text{Molasses}$ is in cups, $\text{Water}$ is in cups, and $\text{Weight of Molasses}$ is in kg.

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ \text{Sugar} = \frac{9}{11} \times 4 \text{ kg} = 3.64 \text{ kg} $$

Therefore, Meri can obtain approximately 3.64 kg of sugar from her 9 cups of molasses and 11 cups of water."

Response:  To find out how much chili is needed to make 6 cups of curry using 5 cups of mayonnaise, we need to calculate the ratio of chili to mayonnaise. Let's assume that the ratio of chili to mayonnaise is 1:2 (i.e., for every cup of mayonnaise, we need half a cup of chili). Therefore, for 6 cups of curry, we will need 3 cups of chili (half of 6 x 2 = 3). So, to make 6 cups of curry using 5 cups of mayonnaise, we will need 3 cups of chili.
Response:  To find out how many more cups of tea Meri can make with the remaining ingredients, we need to subtract the amount she has already used (2 cups) from the total amount available (12 cups of tea leaves and 13 cups of water).

Response:  If Meri has 13 cups of flour and she gives 5 cups to her friend, then she has 8 cups of flour left (13 - 5 = 8). If she wants to make 12 more cupcakes, she will need an additional 960 grams of flour (12 x 80 grams per cupcake = 960 grams). So, in total, Meri needs 960 + 8 = 968 grams of flour.
Response:  To find out how many more cups of rice Tinu needs to buy, we need to subtract the amount she already has (60 cups) from the total amount required for the recipe (140 cups). So, Tinu needs to buy = 140 - 60 = 80 cups of rice.
Response:  Meri has 12 cups of flour and wants to make 9 cups of dough using it. She will have 3 cups of flour left over after making the dough.
Response:  The number of cups of flour needed to make 30 kg of cake is 6 cups (15 kg / 2.5 cups per kilogram).
Response:  If Meri has 9 cups of flour and she needs to make 4 more cups of dough using 14 cups of water, then she will need 4 x 3 = 12 more cups of water. So, she will have to add 12 + 9 = 21 cups of water in total.
Response:  Tini will have 6 cups of rice (9 - 2 = 6) after cooking 7 cups of water with 4 cups of lentils and 3 cups of vegetables.

Response:  There are 53 bottles of wine in Dan's cellar.
Response:  If Dan has 21 bottles of water and he gives 53 bottles to the park, then how many bottles of water does Dan have left? Solution: Let's say Dan has x bottles of water left after giving 53 bottles to the park. We know that x + 53 = 21 (since Dan had 21 bottles initially). Simplifying the equation, we get x = 18 (Since 53 + 18 = 71, which is equal to 21). Therefore, Dan has 18 bottles of water left after giving 53 bottles to the park.

Response:  There are 120 cakes in total (105 sold and 17 new).
Response:  Bekaar sold 13 packets of cookies at Rs 91 each and bought 154 new packets at Rs 105 each. He sold 13 x 91 = 1203 packets in total and bought 154 x 105 = 16,070 packets in total.
"Response:  Bekaar sold 170 items and bought 78 items at a profit of Tk 31 per item. He also purchased 31 new items at a cost price of Tk 45 each. If he wants to sell all the items at the same profit rate, how many more items will he have to buy to reach his target of selling 200 items?

Answer: To calculate the number of additional items that Bekaar needs to purchase, we need to first find out the total value of the items he has already sold and bought. Let's do this step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the total value of the items Bekaar has sold:

170 items x Tk 31 per item = Tk 5,270

Step 2: Calculate the total value of the items Bekaar has bought:

78 items x Tk 45 per item = Tk 3,460

Step 3: Find the total value of all the items Bekaar has dealt with (i.e., the sum of the values of the items he has sold and bought):

Tk 5,270 + Tk 3,460 = Tk 8,730

Now, we know that Bekaar wants to sell 200 items in total. So, we can calculate the total amount he needs to earn from selling these items as follows:

Total amount = 200 items x Tk 31 per item = Tk 6,200

Since Bekaar has already earned Tk 8,730 from selling and buying items, he does not need to buy any more items to reach his target. In fact, he has already exceeded his target by Tk 8,730 - Tk 6,200 = Tk 2,530!"
Response:  The number of cakes that will be left with the baker after selling 75% of them is 76 - 75 = 1. So, there will be one cake left with the baker.
Response:  Bekaar sold 144 pieces of goods at Tk.71 each and then he produced 111 more pieces. How many pieces of goods did Bekaar sell in total?
"Response:  If Becky sells 149 units of cookies and 91 units of pastries, then how many cookies will be left with her after she sells all the pastries?

Solution: Let's say Becky has x cookies left after selling all the pastries. We know that she sold 91 units of pastries, so she has 91 - x cookies left. Since she also sold 149 units of cookies, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:

149 + (91 - x) = 230... (1)

We are told that Becky has 230 cookies in total, so we can solve for x by subtracting 149 from both sides of the equation:

x = 230 - 149

x = 81

Therefore, Becky will have 81 cookies left after selling all the pastries."
Response:  If Becky sells 15 pieces of cake and 103 pieces of pastry, then how many pastries will she have left after selling all her products? Formulation: Let C represent the number of cakes sold (15). P represents the number of pastries sold (103). Total Pastries = 7 x 14 + 103 = 299 + 103 = 402 Now we need to find out how many pastries are left after selling all her products. Left Pastries = Total Pastries - Sold Pastries = 402 - 103 = 309 So, there will be 309 pastries left after selling all her products.
Response:  If Becky has 126 pieces of cake and 48 pieces of pastry, and she sells 15 pieces of cake and 81 pieces of pastry, then how many more pieces of cake does she have after selling?  To solve this problem, we need to find out how much cake and pastry Becky has left after selling. Let's start by subtracting the number of items sold from the total amount of each item that Becky had: Cake: 126 - 15 = 111 Pastry: 48 - 81 = 37 So, Becky has 111 pieces of cake and 37 pieces of pastry left after selling.
Response:  If Becky has made 190 pieces of cake and 131 pieces of pastry, and she sells each piece of cake for $7 and each piece of pastry for $8, then how much money has she earned in total from selling both types of baked goods? Formulation: Total amount earned = (Number of cakes x Price per cake) + (Number of pastries x Price per pastry) Total amount earned = (190 x $7) + (131 x $8)
Response:  If Becky sells 157 units of cookies and 147 units of pastries, then she has sold 304 items in total (157 + 147).
Response:  If Becky sells 68 pieces of cake and 92 pieces of pastry, then she has sold 160 items in total (68 + 92). Therefore, she has sold 40% more pastry than cake (92/68 = 1.375 or 40%).
Response:  If Becky has 44 chocolates and she gives 48 chocolates to her friends, then how many chocolates will be left with Becky? Solution: Let's say Becky has x chocolates left after giving 48 chocolates to her friends. We know that x + 48 = 44 (since Becky had 44 chocolates initially). Now we can solve for x by subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation: x + 48 - 48 = 44 - 48. This simplifies to: x = 0. Therefore, there will be no chocolates left with Becky after she gives away all 48 chocolates.
Response:  If Becky has 80 pieces of cake and she sells 40 pieces at $2 each, then how much money will she make in total from all her sales? Formulation: Total amount made = Number of pieces sold x Price per piece Total amount made = 40 x $2 Total amount made = $80
Response:  If Becky has 137 cookies and gives 169 cookies to her friends, then how many cookies will be left with Becky? Solution: Let's use subtraction to find out how many cookies are left with Becky. We know that Becky gave 169 cookies to her friends, so we can subtract that number from the total number of cookies she had: 137 - 169 =? The result is: 137 - 169 = 32 Cookies will be left with Becky.
Response:  There are 86 new cakes left with Beka after selling 103 cakes.

Formulation: Let C be the number of units of cash left after the sale. We know that Becky sold 44 units of product for $108 each, so she received $4728 in cash (44 x $108). Since she had 61 units of product initially, she still has C units of product left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: C + 61 = 4728. Solving for C, we get: C = 3592. So, Becky will have 3592 units of cash left after the sale.
Response:  If Becky has 56 pieces of jewelry and sells 14 pieces, then how many pieces of jewelry does she have left? Solution: Let x be the number of pieces of jewelry that Becky has after selling 14 pieces. We know that she started with 56 pieces, so we can set up the equation: x + 14 = 56 To solve for x, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: x + 14 - 14 = 56 - 14 x = 42 Therefore, Becky has 42 pieces of jewelry left after selling 14 pieces.
"Response:  If Becky has 52 pieces of cake and 84 pieces of pastries to sell, and she sells 102 pieces of cake and 94 pieces of pastries, then how many more pieces of cake did she sell than pastries?

Answer: To find out how many more pieces of cake were sold than pastries, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold. Let's do that:

102 - 94 =?

The difference is:

102 - 94 = 8

So, Becky sold 8 more pieces of cake than pastries."
Response:  If Bekar has produced 134 units of goods and sold 92 units at a price of Tk. 100 per unit, then he has earned Tk. 9200 from the sale of those goods (i.e., 92 x Tk. 100). To find out how much profit he has made, we need to subtract the cost price of the goods from the selling price. Let's assume that the cost price of each unit is Tk. 80. Then, the profit per unit can be calculated as follows: Profit per unit = Selling price - Cost price Profit per unit = Tk. 100 - Tk. 80 Profit per unit = Tk. 20 Now, let's calculate the total profit: Total profit = Number of units x Profit per unit Total profit = 92 x Tk. 20 Total profit = Tk. 1840 Therefore, Bekar has made a profit of Tk. 1840 by selling 92 units of goods at Tk. 100 per unit.
Response:  If Bekar has sold 80 pieces of pastry and 97 pieces of cake, then he has sold 16 more pieces of pastry than cake (80 - 97 = 16).
Response:  If Bekar has sold 143 pieces of pastry and 78 pieces of cake, then he has sold 75 more pieces of pastry than cake. To find out how many more pieces of pastry he has sold than cake, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries: 143 - 78 = 75.

Response:  There are 79 blocks in total. He used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, there are 64 blocks left unused.
Response:  Tinu has used 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. In total, she has used 80 blocks.
Response:  To find out how many blocks Tinu has used for building his house, we need to subtract the number of blocks he has used for making the boundary wall from the total number of blocks he has. So, the answer is:  33 (total blocks) - 13 (boundary wall blocks) = 20 blocks.
Response: 79 blocks used for building a tower and 82 blocks used for building a house.
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks and uses 59 of them to build a tower, then how many blocks are left with him? Solution: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that Randy has 36 blocks in total, and he used 59 of them to build a tower. So, we can set up an equation as follows: 36 - 59 = x Where x is the number of blocks left with Randy. To solve for x, we subtract 59 from 36: 36 - 59 = 27 Therefore, there are 27 blocks left with Randy after he built his tower using 59 blocks.
Response:  Tinu will use 95 blocks to build one house and 50 blocks to build one tower. Therefore, she will use a total of 145 blocks (95 + 50).

"Response:  I have read 8 out of the total 14 books in the ""Pagal Mukh School"" series."
Response:  If you read 4 books and watch 34 movies, then how many more books can you read? To find out, we need to subtract the number of movies from the total number of books and movies. Let’s do that: Total number of books and movies = 62 (given in the problem) Number of books = 4 (what you have already done) Number of movies = 34 (what you have already done) Now, let’s subtract the number of movies from the total number of books and movies: 62 - 34 =? The result is: 62 - 34 = 28 So, if you read 4 books and watched 34 movies, you could still read 28 more books.
Response:  If you read 7 books and watch 4 movies, then you will have watched/read a total of 7 + 4 = 11 different works.
"Response:  If you read 11 books and watch 40 movies in the ""Crime Scene School"" series, then approximately how many more books are there in the series than movies?  To solve this problem, we need to find out how many books and movies are available in total in the series. Let's assume that each book has 250 pages and each movie lasts for 2 hours. Books: 11 x 250 = 2750 pages Movies: 40 x 2 = 80 hours Now, let's calculate the ratio of books to movies based on their page count and duration: Ratio of books to movies = (2750 / 80) = 34.375 This means that for every one hour of watching movies, you would have read about 34.375 pages of books in the series. So, if you watched all 40 movies, you would have read approximately 40 x 34.375 = 1378 pages of books. Since there are 15 books in the series, we can say that there are approximately 15 x 1378 = 20670 pages of books in the series. Therefore, there are approximately 20670 - 2750 = 17920 more pages of books in the series than movies."

Response:  If Tinu takes 76 sacks of rice weighing 50 kg each and has to sell them at a profit of 64 taka per sack, then how many kilograms of paddy will he have to buy daily if he wants to make a profit of 50 taka per day?  Solution: Let X be the number of kilograms of paddy that Tinu needs to buy daily. Since he is selling each sack of rice for 64 taka, his total daily income from selling rice will be 76 x 64 = 4896 taka. His expenditure on buying paddy will be X taka. So, his daily profit will be: Profit = 4896 - X  To find out X, we can set up the equation: 4896 - X = 50 Therefore, X = 4846 or X = 4896 + 50 = 4946 Thus, Tinu needs to buy either 4846 kg or 4946 kg of paddy daily to make a profit of 50 taka per day.

= $192 / $15
= 128 t-shirts

For jars of jam:
Number of jars of jam = Total amount / Price per jar of jam

Therefore, Reza needs to sell 128 t-shirts and 11 jars of jam to earn $192 and $34 respectively."
Response:  To find out how much profit is made from selling one jar of tea and one shirt, we need to calculate the total cost price of each item first. The cost price of one jar of tea is Tk 86 and the cost price of one shirt is Tk 232. So, the total cost price of one jar of tea and one shirt is: Total Cost Price = (Tk 86 + Tk 232) = Tk 318 Now, let's divide the total cost price by the number of items sold to get the unit price of each item: Unit Price of Jar of Tea = Total Cost Price / Number of Jars of Tea Sold = Tk 318 / 254 = Tk 125 per jar of tea Unit Price of Shirt = Total Cost Price / Number of Shirts Sold = Tk 318 / 43 = Tk 73 per shirt Next, we can multiply the unit price of each item by the number of items sold to get the total revenue for each item: Revenue from Selling One Jar of Tea = Unit Price x Number of Jars of Tea Sold = Tk 125 x 254 = Tk 31,200 Revenue from Selling One Shirt = Unit Price x Number of Shirts Sold = Tk 73 x 43 = Tk 3,190 Therefore, the total revenue from selling one jar of tea and one shirt is: Total Revenue = Revenue from Selling One Jar of Tea + Revenue from Selling One Shirt = Tk 31,200 + Tk 3,190 = Tk 34,390

Response:  To find out how much profit is made from selling one T-shirt and one pair of jeans, we need to calculate the cost price of each item first. The cost price of a T-shirt is $210, and the cost price of a pair of jeans is $240. So, the total cost price of both items is: Total Cost Price = $210 + $240 = $450 Now, let's calculate the selling price of each item. The selling price of a T-shirt is $177, and the selling price of a pair of jeans is $23. So, the total selling price of both items is: Total Selling Price = $177 + $23 = $200 Since the total selling price is greater than the total cost price, there will be a profit. To find out how much profit is made from selling one T-shirt and one pair of jeans, we can subtract the total cost price from the total selling price: Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price Profit = $200 - $450 = -$250 This means that selling one T-shirt and one pair of jeans results in a loss of $250.
Response:  To find out how much profit is made from selling one jar of jam and one t-shirt, we need to calculate the total cost price of both items first. The cost price of one jar of jam is Tk. 115, and the cost price of one t-shirt is Tk. 25. So, the total cost price of both items together would be: Total Cost Price = Tk. 115 + Tk. 25 = Tk. 140 Now, let's subtract the total cost price from the selling price of both items to find out the profit: Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost Price For the jar of jam: Profit = Tk. 160 - Tk. 140 = Tk. 20 For the t-shirt: Profit = Tk. 250 - Tk. 140 = Tk. 110 Therefore, the profit made from selling one jar of jam and one t-shirt together is Tk. 20 + Tk. 110 = Tk. 130.

= (233 x $49)
= $11,577

Therefore, Harvest will pay Moses $11,577 over 233 weeks at a weekly payment of $49."
Response:  If Harvest Mosume spends $368 per month and wants to increase her income by $20 per week (i.e., $388 - $368 = $20), then she needs to earn an additional $80 per month ($20 x 4 weeks) to reach her target of $388 per month. Therefore, she should charge $388 + $80 = $468 per month.
Response:  If Luis gives away $216 per month and has $491 at the beginning of 1181 months, then how much money will he have left after 1181 months? Formulation: Let X be the amount of money Luis has after 1181 months. Given that he starts with $491 and gives away $216 per month. So, we can write an equation based on the information given: X = 491 - (1181 x 216) To solve for X, we can substitute the value of 1181 into the equation: X = 491 - (1181 x 216) X = 491 - 253760 X = 491 - 253760 We know that X is the amount of money Luis has after 1181 months, so we want to find out what X is equal to. Therefore, we can say that X is equal to: X = 491 - 253760 X = 251840 This means that after 1181 months, Luis will have $251840 left if he gives away $216 per month and starts with $491.

= 3.85 cubic meters per hour."
Response:  The water in the jug was 8 feet deep.
Response:  The water level in the tank was 12 feet deep.
Response:  The water in the jug was 15 gallons (g).
Response:  The water in the tank was 16 feet deep and the diameter of the tank was 9 feet. If 13 buckets of water were taken out, then how much water was left in the tank? Solution: Let's assume that the volume of one bucket is x liters. Then, the total volume of water taken out would be 13 x liters. Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank. To do this, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder. In this case, the radius of the base of the tank is half of the diameter, which is 9/2 = 4.5 feet. So, the radius of the base of the tank is 4.5 feet. Now, we can plug in the values to get the volume of the remaining water in the tank: V = π(4.5)^2 \* 16 = approximately 80.7 cubic meters. Therefore, there are approximately 80.7 cubic meters of water left in the tank after taking out 13 buckets of water.
Response:  The water level in the tank is 9 feet (9 gunit) less than the height of the wall.

"Response:  If Devil gave 264 bottles of wine to his friends in 11 days and he used to give 15 bottles per day, then how many bottles of wine are left with him?

Answer:  To find out how many bottles of wine are left with Devil, we need to subtract the total number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles possessed by Devil. Let's do that:

Total number of bottles given away = 264 (as mentioned in the problem)
Total number of bottles possessed by Devil = 30 x 15 = 450 (since he had 30 bottles for each of the 15 days)

Now, let's subtract the total number of bottles given away from the total number of bottles possessed by Devil:

450 - 264 = 186

Therefore, there are 186 bottles of wine left with Devil."

Answer:  To find out how many days it will take for all the pani bottles to be finished, we need to divide the total amount of water in the pani bottles by the daily usage of water. Let's do that:

Total amount of water in pani bottles = 40 x 4 = 160 liters

Daily usage of water = 4 liters

Therefore, number of days required to finish all the pani bottles = Total amount of water / Daily usage of water
= 160 / 4
= 40 days

So, it will take 40 days for all the pani bottles to be finished if they are used at the rate of 4 liters per day."

"Response:  If 150 bottles of water and 180 bottles of juice are consumed daily, and if each bottle of water has 540 ml and each bottle of juice has 350 ml, then how many days will it take for all the water and juice to finish?

Answer: To find out how many days it will take for all the water and juice to finish, we need to divide the total quantity of both by the daily consumption. Let's do this step by step:

Total quantity of water = 150 x 540 ml = 81,000 ml
Total quantity of juice = 180 x 350 ml = 63,000 ml

Daily consumption of water = 150 bottles x 540 ml/bottle = 81,000 ml
Daily consumption of juice = 180 bottles x 350 ml/bottle = 63,000 ml

Now, let's divide the total quantity by the daily consumption:

Days required for water to finish = Total quantity of water / Daily consumption of water = 81,000 ml / 81,000 ml = 1 (day)

Days required for juice to finish = Total quantity of juice / Daily consumption of juice = 63,000 ml / 63,000 ml = 1 (day)

Therefore, it will take one day for all the water and juice to finish."

Response:  If 6 pensils are placed in two baskets, and each basket can hold 3 pensils, then how many pensils were left unplaced?  Solution: Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of pensils that were left unplaced. We know that 2 baskets were used, so we can write an equation for the total number of pensils as follows: 6 + 6 = 12 (total number of pensils) Now, we know that each basket can hold 3 pensils, so we can write another equation for the number of pensils in each basket: 3 + 3 = 6 (number of pensils in each basket) Now, let's substitute the value of the total number of pensils into the second equation: 12 - 6 =? (number of pensils left unplaced) Solving for x, we get: x = 6 (therefore, 6 pensils were left unplaced)

Response:  To determine how many trips are required to transport all 111 students of a school with 72 classrooms using 3 buses, we need to calculate the number of students that can be accommodated in each bus. Let's assume each bus has a capacity of 30 students (as there are 3 buses and 30 is a common capacity for each bus). Now, let's calculate the total number of students that can be transported by all three buses: Total number of students = Number of students per bus x Number of buses Total number of students = 30 x 3 = 90 students Since there are 111 students in total, we need to make more than one trip to transport all the students: Trips required = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus Trips required = 111 / 30 = 3 trips Therefore, three trips will be required to transport all 111 students of the school using 3 buses.
Response:  To find out how much rice each hostel needs to buy if all the dormitories are fully occupied, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of dormitories.

Step-by-step solution:  
Let's assume that each bag contains x apples. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  
x + x = 42... (1) Since there are two bags, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get:  
2(x + x) = 42... (2) Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:  
2x + 2x = 42... (3) Combining like terms, we get:  
4x = 42... (4) Now, dividing both sides by 4, we get:  
x = 10... (5) Therefore, if Frank gives 2 bags to each of his friends, he will have 10 apples left with him."

"Response:  Of the 190 items of regular soap and 60 items of detergent soap, how many were bottled from the detergent soap?  To solve this problem, we need to use our knowledge of ratios and proportions. Let's assume that the ratio of regular soap to detergent soap is constant. So, if x bottles of regular soap were bottled from the detergent soap, then the number of bottles of detergent soap would be 60 - x. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of bottles of regular soap bottled from the detergent soap.

We know that the total number of bottles of regular soap + detergent soap = 190 + 60 = 250.

So, the equation becomes:

x + (60 - x) = 250...(1)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 60 = 250...(2)

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us:

2x = 190...(3)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 95...(4)

Therefore, 95 bottles of regular soap were bottled from the detergent soap."

Answer: To find out how many janki meals will be distributed for every 19 houses (or buildings), we need to divide the total number of janki meals by the number of houses (or buildings). In this case, we have:

Total number of janki meals = 78 x 30 = 2340
Number of houses (or buildings) = 19

So, to distribute 2340 janki meals among 19 houses (or buildings), we can divide 2340 by 19:

2340 ÷ 19 = 123

Therefore, for every 19 houses (or buildings), 123 janki meals will be distributed."

Answer: To find out how many jin of cement are required to make 40 blocks, we first need to calculate how many jin of cement are required to make one block. We know that one block requires four jin of cement, so:

Jin of cement per block = 4 Jin

Now, we can calculate how many jin of cement are required to make 40 blocks by multiplying the number of blocks by the amount of cement required per block:

Total jin of cement required for 40 blocks = Number of blocks x Jin of cement per block
= 40 x 4
= 160 Jin

Therefore, the man will need 160 jin of cement to make 40 blocks for 17 houses, assuming each house requires an average of 4 blocks."

"Response:  If Tinu scores 84 points in a game of cricket against Ronnie and gets the same number of runs as Ronnie, then how many runs did Ronnie score? Let's assume that both players scored the same number of runs. So, we can set up an equation based on this assumption: 
Tinu's score = Ronnie's score... (1) Since Tinu scored 84 runs, we can substitute 84 for Tinu's score in equation (1): 
Ronnie's score = 84... (2) Now we need to find out what Ronnie's score was. To do this, we can divide both sides of equation (2) by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
Ronnie's score x 2 = 84 x 2... (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: 
Ronnie's score = 42... (4) Therefore, Ronnie scored 42 runs in the game of cricket."

Response:  The number of planks required for building a house with an area of 1200 square feet can be calculated as follows: Let's assume that each plank has a length of 8 feet and a width of 2 inches (assuming standard dimensions). Therefore, the area of one plank is 8 x 2 = 16 square feet. To calculate the total number of planks required, we need to divide the total area of the house by the area of one plank: Total number of planks = Total area of house / Area of one plank Total number of planks = 1200 sq ft / 16 sq ft Total number of planks = 75 Since there are 74 pieces of plywood available, we can use them to build 74/16 = 4 planks, leaving us with 71 remaining planks to cover the rest of the house. Therefore, the answer is 71 planks.
