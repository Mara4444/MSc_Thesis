Mother gave 8 taka to Goyen's father. Father gave 5 taka more than that to Goyen. If Goyen received 4 taka from his mother, then his total amount of money is 4 + 5 = 9 taka."
"Response: 4000
Explanation:
Given that Goyen's mother gave him 3 dollars from her own pocket money and his father gave him 6 dollars more than what his mother gave him, we can calculate the total amount of money given to Goyen as follows:

Total amount = Mother's gift + Father's gift
= 3 + (6 - 3)
= 3 + 3
= 6

Therefore, Goyen's father gave him 6 dollars more than what his mother gave him, making the total amount of money given to Goyen 6 dollars."
"Response: 4000
Explanation:
Given that Goyen's mother gave him 5 dollars and his father gave him 7 dollars more than what his mother gave him, we can calculate the amount of money given by his father as follows:

Father's gift = Mother's gift + 7 dollars
= 5 dollars + 7 dollars
= 12 dollars

Now, if Goyen gave 4 dollars to his mother, then the amount of money left with his mother is:

Mother's remaining amount = Original amount - Amount given by Goyen
= 12 dollars - 4 dollars
= 8 dollars

Therefore, the amount of money given by Goyen's mother is 8 dollars."

Therefore, the number of tanks Bekaar produced is either 4664 or 6064, depending on how many days he produced them for."
Response: 480 kgs (or 1057 lbs) of rice will be left with Becker after he has sold 440 kg (or 970 lbs) of rice.
"Response: 560
Explanation:
If Bekaar has 80 tonnes of sugar and he sells it at 40 taka per kg, then his total revenue will be 80 x 40 = 3200 taka. If he sold 40 tonnes of sugar in the first place, then he must have had 80 - 40 = 40 tonnes of sugar left over after selling 40 tones. Therefore, the number of kegs that Bekaar has is 40 / 10 (keg size) = 4 kegs."
"Response: 1370

"Response: 460
Explanation: According to the question, Becker made 81 tikis and sold them for $92 each. He then made 46 more tikis and sold them for $46 each. Therefore, the total number of tikis that Becker sold is 46 + 46 = 92."

"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the question, there are 46 tiles in Kelir's cache and 132 tiles in his inventory. To find out how many tiles he has of each type (Kelir or Sani), we need to divide the number of tiles he has by 2 since each game tile represents two tiles in total. Therefore, Kelir has 46/2 = 23 tiles of Kelir games and 132/2 = 66 tiles of Sani games."
Response: 6 games will be left in Kelir's bag after he takes out 31 games. So, there are 6 games that remain in his bag.

Response: 80 days
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the given information, Tina and her friends consume 67 sacks of rice per day, and each sack contains 12 kg of rice. Therefore, they consume 808 kg (67 x 12) of rice per day.

Explanation:
To find out how much money Arkansas and Texas will make from selling rice and jeans respectively, we need to multiply the number of tons sold by the price per ton.
For Arkansas, they will sell 67 tons of rice at $67 per ton, so their total revenue will be:
67 x $67 = $4389
For Texas, they will sell 165 tons of jeans at $165 per ton, so their total revenue will be:
165 x $165 = $26975
Therefore, the total amount of money Arkansas and Texas will make is:
$4389 + $26975 = $31364
Note that this calculation assumes that the prices per ton are constant, which may not necessarily be the case in real life."
Response: 192 dollars.
"Response: 107

Explanation:
The total amount of money that Lewis spends in each month is $21 x 21 = $421. Since he spends $702 in total, he has $281 left over after paying for all the months. Therefore, at the end of the 21st month, Lewis will have $354 left."
"Response: 4260$
Explanation:
If Lewis spent $1357 per week for 22 weeks, he spent a total of $29,844 ($1357 x 22). If he then worked for 73 days at $15 per hour, his total earnings would be $10,950 ($15 x 73). Therefore, Lewis's total earnings over the 22 weeks are $30,794 ($29,844 + $10,950)."
"Response: 45760
Explanation:
To find out how much money Lewis made in total, we need to multiply the number of weeks he worked (1091) by his weekly earnings ($28). This gives us a total of $28,638.
However, since Lewis worked overtime for 40 hours per week, his total earnings for the year would be higher than this amount. To calculate his total earnings, we can multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks he worked overtime (52), which is the number of weeks in a standard year. This gives us a total of $45,760."
Response: 403 x 233 = 93,596
"Response: 40270
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:
Harvest time = 1359 weeks
Average income per week = $368
Total income for harvest season = Total number of weeks x Average income per week
= 1359 x $368
= $484,770
Now, let's find out how much Harvester Moses earned during the harvest season:
If he earned $388 per day instead of $368, his total income would be:
Total income = Number of days in harvest season x Daily income
= 1359 days x $388
= $402,700
Therefore, Harvester Moses earned $402,700 during the harvest season."
"Response: 500 x $ 491 = $ 245,500
$ 245,500 / $ 216 per week = 110 weeks

Explanation:
According to the given information, Sanat's height is 6 feet (72 inches), and his weight is 180 pounds (82 kg). To calculate his BMI, we need to divide his weight in kilograms by his height in meters squared.

BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²
= 82 kg / (6 ft)²
= 82 kg / 36 m²
= 2.25

So, Sanat's BMI is approximately 2.25, which falls under the ""normal"" category according to the BMI classification chart."
Response: 27 (given that 15 x 4 = 60 and 60 / 3 = 20)
"Response: 240
Explanation:
The diameter of the wheel is given as 16 guna (units are not specified). Let's assume that each guna represents 0.5 cm (which is a common conversion factor for guna to centimeter). Then, the diameter of the wheel in centimeters is:

16 guna × 0.5 cm/guna = 8 cm

Now, we need to find out how many full turns the wheel makes in one revolution. Since the wheel has 9 fathoms (ফুট) beyond the dinar (ডিন), and there are 13 fathoms in one full turn, we can calculate the number of full turns as follows:

Number of full turns = Total length of the wheel / Length of one full turn
= 8 cm + 9 fathoms - 13 fathoms
= 8 cm + 0.5 cm - 0.5 cm
= 8.5 cm

So, the wheel makes approximately 8.5 complete turns in one revolution. Therefore, if it takes 24 hours for the wheel to make one full rotation, then it will take:

Time taken for one rotation = Number of full turns / Time period
= 8.5 turns / 24 hours
= 0.357 turns per hour

Therefore, the answer is 240."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
According to the given information, the diameter of the wheel is 32 cm and its circumference is 9 times the diameter, which means that the circumference is 32 x 9 = 288 cm.
Now, we are asked how many full turns the wheel makes in one revolution. Since there are 360 degrees in a complete rotation, we can divide the circumference by 360 to find out how many parts of a turn the wheel makes in one revolution:
288 cm / 360 = 0.78
So, the wheel makes approximately 0.78 full turns in one revolution."

* The rate of Regula's soil is 1:4 (i.e., for every 4 botols of water in Regula's soil, there are 1 botol of water in the mud).
* There are 61 botols of water in Dayeret's soil.

Now, to find out how many botols of water are in Dayeret's soil after mixing with Regula's soil, we need to multiply the number of botols of water in Dayeret's soil by the ratio of Regula's soil to mud. So, the total number of botols of water in Dayeret's soil after mixing with Regula's soil will be:

61 botols x 4/1 = 244 botols

Amount of water in one drum = 79 liters
Now, we need to find out how many drums are required to fill up the remaining amount of water (79 liters) after filling 4 drums completely.
To do this, we divide the total capacity of all drums by the capacity of each drum:
80 liters / 20 liters = 4 drums
Therefore, 4 drums are required to fill up the remaining amount of water (79 liters).
So, the number of drums that contain Regula's soil is 4."

* The amount of money that will be received per day = 100 dollars
* The number of days until the end of the year = 259 (or 260 in leap years)

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of money that will be received during the remaining days of the year. To do this, we can multiply the number of days by the amount of money received per day:

Total amount of money = Number of days x Amount of money received per day
= 259 x 100
= 25900

So, the total amount of money that will be received during the remaining days of the year is $25,900."

However, since some days have more than 600 janitors, we need to subtract the number of days with fewer than 600 janitors from the total number of days to get the final answer. Therefore, the number of janitors working in Bakirham's palaces is 26,399 - (39 - 6) = 42578."
