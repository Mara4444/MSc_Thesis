Response:  We know that Julie played with 18 toys and Mangal played with 10 toys. Now we have to find out how many toys Mangal played with more than Julie did. So, let's subtract the number of toys Julie played with from the number of toys Mangal played with: 10 - 18 = -8 To summarize, Mangal played with 8 more toys than Julie did.
Response:  On Monday (Jul 11), 11 children played together with 3 tags.  On Tuesday (Jul 12), 12 children played together with 4 tags. How many tags were there in total for these two days?
Response:  Julie has 5 bachchaaks (balls) and she plays with them every Monday. On Wednesday, there are 15 bachchaaks in total to play with. So, how many bachchaaks will Julie have after playing with them for one day (Monday)?
"Response:  We know that Julie has played with 14 toys in total and she has played with each toy for 30 minutes. So, the total time she spent playing with all her toys is:

Time = Number of toys x Time per toy
= 14 x 30
= 420 minutes

Now, we are asked how many hours Julie has spent playing with all her toys. To convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60:

Hours = Minutes / 60
= 420 / 60
= 7 hours

Therefore, Julie has spent 7 hours playing with all her toys."
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 16 children can play together in one day if they are playing with each other for 2 hours at a time. So, we need to divide 16 by 2 to get the number of times they can play together in a day:

16 / 2 = 8

So, the children can play together 8 times in a day."
Response:  We know that July has 31 days and August has 31 days as well. So, if we subtract 8 from 31, we get 23. Therefore, there are 23 days difference between July 14th and August 8th.
Response:  Julie has played with 17 toys in total and distributed them equally among 4 children. So each child got 4 toys. Now, there are 15 toys left, which means that 2 children have 3 toys each. Finally, Buddha has 2 toys. Therefore, the number of toys that Julie played with is 17.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia), there are 15 children playing together. On Monday ( Mangal), there are 18 children playing together. And on Tuesday ( Buddha), there are 97 children playing together. So, in total, there are 120 children playing together (15 + 18 + 97 = 120).
Response:  On Sunday (Som), there are 5 children playing together. On Monday (Mangal), there are 9 children playing together. And on Buddha (Budh), there are 15 children playing together. So, in total, there are 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children playing together.
Response:  Julie has 2 toys and wants to share them equally among her 4 friends. So, each friend will get 1/2 of the total number of toys = 2 x 4 = 8 toys. Now, Mangal has 14 toys and wants to distribute them equally among his 3 friends. So, each friend will get 14 / 3 = 4.67 toys (round off to 4 toys). And Buddha has 16 toys and wants to distribute them equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 16 / 5 = 3.2 toys (round off to 3 toys). Therefore, the total number of toys that all the children together have is: 8 + 4 + 3 = 15 toys.
Response:  We know that Julie has played with 9 children on Sunday and 7 children on Monday. So, in total, she has played with 9 + 7 = 16 children. Now, we are asked how many times more children Mangal did not play with than he played with. In other words, we need to find out how many fewer children Mangal played with than Julie played with. To do this, we can divide the number of children Mangal played with (96) by the number of children Julie played with (16), which gives us a ratio of 96/16 = 5.875. Therefore, Mangal did not play with 5.875 times as many children as Julie played with.
Response:  On Sunday, there are 14 children playing together. On Monday, 2 more children join them, making it 16 in total. Then, on Tuesday, 8 more children come to play, bringing the total number of children to 24. So, the difference between the number of children playing on Sunday and those playing on Tuesday is: 14 - 2 = 12.
Response:  On Monday (Mangalwar), there are 11 days in July and 9 days in August. So, if we subtract 9 from 11, we get 2 days left for playing with children during these months. Therefore, the answer is 2 days.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia), there are 15 children playing together. On Monday ( Mangal), there are 18 children playing together. On Tuesday ( Buddha), there are 7 children playing together. Now let's find out how many children were playing together on each day of the week:  Sunday - 15 children Monday - 18 children Tuesday - 7 children Total number of children playing together = 15 + 18 + 7 = 40 children Therefore, on Wednesday (Budhwar), there were 40 children playing together.
Response:  We know that Julie has 13 toys and she wants to share them equally among her 10 friends. So, each friend will get 1.3 toys (since there are 13 toys and 10 friends). Now, let's see how many toys Buddha will get if he plays with all of them together. Since there are 15 toys in total (including the ones Julie had), Buddha will get 1/3 of them, which is 5 toys. Therefore, the final answer is:  Julie has 13 toys, she shares them equally among her 10 friends, and Buddha gets 5 toys.
Response:  We have to find out how many cards Buddhinath has played so far and then calculate the number of cards left for him to play.  Based on the given information, we can see that Juliana has played 7 cards so far, and she has 3 cards left to play. Similarly, Satyam has played 10 cards so far, and he has 2 cards left to play. Now, let's come to Buddhinath. He has played 20 cards so far, which means he has 20 - 2 = 18 cards left to play. Therefore, the final answer is 18.
Response:  Julie played with Someday for 12 hours and then took a break of 4 hours. Then she played again with him for another 8 hours. So in total, Julie spent 12 + 4 = 16 hours playing with Someday. Now, let's calculate how much time Omar spent playing with Dunnock. According to the question, Omar played with Dunnock for 34 hours straight without any breaks. Therefore, the answer is 34 hours.
"Response:  We know that Julie played with 19 toys and Dunu played with 38 toys.  So, we need to find out how many times Julie's toys are equal to Dunu's toys.  To do this, we divide the number of toys played by each child by the number of days they played together.  For Julie, it is 19/5 = 3.8; for Dunu, it is 38/5 = 7.6.  Since both numbers are not whole numbers, we round them off to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Julie's toys are approximately equal to 4 times Dunu's toys."
Response:  On Monday (Julie), there were 5 children playing together. On Tuesday (Somdi), they played for 6 hours with 4 children. So, in total, they played for 5 + 6 = 11 hours.
Response:  Julie has 18 balls and wants to play with 4 children at a time. How many times can she play with them in total?  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively, how many times can she play with each child?  Finally, let's calculate the total number of times she can play with all the children together.
Response:  Julie has played with 6 toys for 17 minutes and then she took a break of 30 minutes. After that, she played again with 4 toys for 25 minutes. So, in total, Julie played with toys for 1 hour and 25 minutes (6 + 17 + 4 = 37). Now, let's compare it with Buddhin's playtime. Buddhin played with 8 toys for 30 minutes, which is equal to Julie's playtime during her second session (4 x 30 = 120). Therefore, we can say that Julie played more than Buddhin in terms of number of toys played with (6 vs 8) and duration of playtime (1 hour and 25 minutes vs 30 minutes).
Response:  Bob has eaten some mithai (sweet dish) and now he wants to know how much of it is left. He has counted that there are 25 tumblers ( small bowls used for serving food ) filled with mithai and each tumbler contains 43 mithais. So, in total, there are 25 x 43 = 1075 mithais left. Therefore, the answer is 1075.
Response:  Bob has 28 teeth and he eats 42 chocolates. So, in total, Bob has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 chocolates. Now, let's calculate how many chocolates Bob can eat per day. If Bob eats 63 chocolates in one day, then he will have 63 - 70 = -7 chocolates left for that day. Therefore, Bob cannot eat all 42 chocolates in one day.
Response:  Bob has 33 tonnes of mithai to eat and he can eat only one type of sweet at a time. He eats 14 tonnes of chocolate in total. So, he still has 19 tonnes of mithai left (33 - 14 = 19). Now, let's assume that each piece of mithai is equal to half a kilogram. Therefore, Bob has 19 x 0.5 kg = 9.5 kg of mithai left to eat. Since he already ate 14 tonnes of chocolate, there are 9.5 kg - 14 = 5.5 kg of chocolate remaining.
Response:  Bob has 38 tonnes of rice to eat and he eats 36 tonnes in one sitting. He then has 16 tonnes of chocolate left over. If Bob had 40 tonnes of chocolate initially, how much does he have now? So, Bob has 24 tonnes of chocolate left after eating 36 tonnes.
Response:  Bob has 20 pieces of cake and he eats 34 pieces. Now, there are only 18 pieces left. So, Bob does not eat any more cake.
Response:  Bob has 21 apples and he eats 5 of them. Now he has 16 apples left. He then meets Tuko who gives him 9 more apples. So now Bob has 25 apples in total (16 + 9 = 25).
Response:  Bob has 22 tonnes of chocolate and wants to share it equally among 5 friends. Each friend will get 4.4 tonnes of chocolate (22/5). Now, if Bob wants to eat one chocolate himself, he will have 0.8 tonnes left (22 - 1 = 0.8). So, the answer is 0.8 tonnes.
Response:  Bob has 19 toffees and he eats 3 at a time. How many times will he eat them?  He will eat them 6 times (19 / 3 = 6). Now, how many toffees will be left after he finishes eating them all? There will be 3 toffees left (19 - 6 x 3 = 3).
Response:  Bob has 32 tonnes of chocolate and he wants to share it equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 6.4 tonnes of chocolate (32/5). Now, let's assume that one of the friends, Omi, eats 20 tonnes of chocolate in one go. This means that there are now 12 tonnes of chocolate left (32 - 20 = 12). Therefore, Omi will have to eat only half of what is left, which is 6 tonnes (12 / 2 = 6).
Response:  Bob has 17 apples and he eats 3 in one go. Now he has 14 apples left. If he continues to eat at this rate, how many apples will he have after 15 more eating sessions of 3 apples each?  We can calculate it as follows: Number of apples Bob has after 15 eating sessions = Total number of apples Bob has x Rate of eating per session / Number of eating sessions After 15 eating sessions, Bob will have 14 x 15 / 15 = 120 apples So, after 15 more eating sessions, Bob will have 120 apples.
Response:  Bob has eaten 23 tonnes of rice in total. If he starts with 30 tonnes and then eats half of it (15 tonnes), how much will be left after he finishes eating? So, there will be 15 tonnes of rice left after Bob finishes eating.
"Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs Elon can buy with $5 and how many gumballs he will have left after buying 3 gumballs from the park.  So, firstly, we need to calculate the cost of one gumball in terms of dollars. According to the given information, ""one gumball costs $0.20"". Now, let's calculate the number of gumballs Elon can buy with $5: Number of gumballs = Cost of one gumball x Amount of money available $= $0.20 x $5$= $1.00 Now, let's check how many gumballs Elon will have left after buying 3 gumballs from the park: Number of gumballs left = Total number of gumballs - Number of gumballs bought at the park $= $1.00 - $3.00$= $-$2.00 Therefore, according to the calculation, Elon will have $2.00 worth of gumballs left after buying 3 gumballs from the park."
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Jack can throw in 3 seconds.  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken by Jack to throw one ball.  As he throws three balls simultaneously, the total time taken is 3 seconds. So, the time taken by Jack to throw one ball = 3 seconds / 3 balls = 1 second per ball. Now, let's assume that Jack can throw one ball every second. Therefore, the number of balls Jack can throw in 3 seconds = 3 seconds / 1 second per ball = 3 balls. Hence, there are 3 balls thrown by Jack in 3 seconds.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Elon can throw in 3 minutes and 30 seconds.  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken by Elon to throw each ball.  Let's assume that it takes him 1 second to throw each ball.  So, he can throw 30 balls in 3 minutes (3 x 60 = 180 seconds). Now, we need to subtract the time taken by Elon to throw each ball from the total time available. Therefore, the number of balls Elon can throw in 3 minutes and 30 seconds is: 30 balls / 1 sec per ball = 30 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs Jack can fit in his pocket and then calculate how many more he needs to reach 60 gumballs.  So, let's assume that Jack's pocket can hold 3 gumballs comfortably (based on the size of a typical gumball). Now, we need to find out how many pockets Jack has. Based on the question, Jack has 20 elbow grease bottles in his backpack. Since each elbow grease bottle takes up space equal to 4 gumballs, Jack has 80 gumballs worth of space taken up by his backpack (4 x 20 = 80). This means that Jack has room for 60 - 80 = 20 additional gumballs in his pocket. Therefore, Jack needs 60 - 20 = 40 more gumballs to fill all six pockets.
Response:  We have to take 5 tons of gobar from Elan Park and bring it to Ahmedabad. Now, we know that each ton of gobar requires 6 bags of basmati rice to fill it. So, if we want to fill 5 tons of gobar with basmati rice, we will need 30 tons (5 x 6) of basmati rice. But we don't have enough space in our park to keep 30 tons of basmati rice! Therefore, we cannot bring 5 tons of gobar from Elan Park to Ahmedabad.
Response:  We have to buy three gumballs from Elon at Park A and then go to Park B to exchange them for five gumballs. So, we will get three gumballs from Elon and then give two of them to him in exchange for one gumball each. Therefore, after this transaction, there will be four gumballs left with Elon (three he gave us plus one he kept). Now, let's calculate how many gumballs Elon has overall. He had three gumballs initially, which he gave us, so now he has three + 2 = 5 gumballs.
Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs are in each jar and then add them up.  There are three jars of gumballs, and each jar has 10 gumballs inside. So, there are 3 x 10 = 30 gumballs in total. Now, let's count the number of gumballs in each jar: Jar 1 has 10 gumballs, Jar 2 has 8 gumballs, and Jar 3 has 5 gumballs. Therefore, the total number of gumballs in all three jars is 10 + 8 + 5 = 23 gumballs. Finally, we need to subtract the number of gumballs that are already in the park (6 gumballs) from the total number of gumballs: 23 - 6 = 17 gumballs left in the park.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Jack has in total and then calculate the number of balls he has in each park.  So, let's start with the information given in the question:  Elon can throw 6 balls into the Gabbar Park. If he throws three balls at a time, how many times will he go to the Gabbar Park?  Now, we know that Jack has 3 times more balls than Elon, so he has 3 x 6 = 18 balls in total.  Since he has 18 balls, he can throw 18 / 3 = 6 balls at a time into any one of the parks.  So, if he goes to the Gabbar Park, he will throw 6 balls there.  Similarly, if he goes to the Kinnalka Park, he will throw 6 balls there too.  Therefore, the answer is:  Jack has 6 balls in the Gabbar Park and 6 balls in the Kinnalka Park.
Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs Elon can buy with $5 and how many he will be left with after buying 4 gumballs from the park. So, we need to subtract $4 from $5. Therefore, Elon has $1 left after buying 4 gumballs from the park. Now, let's assume that each gumball costs $0.30. To find out how many gumballs Elon can buy with his remaining amount of $1, we divide $1 by $0.30. Therefore, Elon can buy 3 gumballs with his remaining amount of $1.
Response:  Elon Musk has 6 Tesla Gubbaras in his park. Jack wants to buy three of them. So, Jack will have 3 Tesla Gubbaras in his park. Now, there are 9 Tesla Gubbaras left in the park (6 + 3).
Response:  Elon Musk has 6 Tesla Gubbaras in his park. He wants to sell 3 of them and buy a Jack Parker Park charger. How many Basis Gubbaras will he have left after buying the charger?
Response:  Elon Musk has 5 Tesla Gubbaras and Jack Park has 6 Tesla Gubbaras in the same park. If Elon Musk sells 3 Tesla Gubbaras to Jack Park, how many Tesla Gubbaras will Jack Park have after buying them?
Response:  We have to find out how many gubbaras are there in total and then calculate the number of jacks that can fit in them.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 30 tonnes of gubbaras and each gubbara contains 5 tonnes of ganja.  Therefore, the total amount of ganja in gubbaras is: 30 tonnes x 5 tonnes/gubbara = 150 tonnes of ganja. Now, we need to find out how many jacks can fit in these 150 tonnes of ganja. The size of a jack is given as 59 tonnes. So, we can divide the total amount of ganja by the size of a jack to get an idea of how many jacks can fit in it: 150 tonnes / 59 tonnes/jack = 2.6 jacks. Therefore, approximately 2.6 jacks can fit in 150 tonnes of ganja.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Jack can throw in 7 seconds and how many balls he can catch in 6 seconds. Then we will know how many balls he can play with in total.  So, let's calculate it!  Time taken by Jack to throw a ball = 7 seconds Time taken by Jack to catch a ball = 6 seconds Number of balls thrown by Jack = Total time / Time taken by Jack to throw a ball = 7 Seconds x 5 Balls/Second = 35 Balls Number of balls caught by Jack = Total time / Time taken by Jack to catch a ball = 6 Seconds x 4 Balls/Second = 24 Balls Now, we know that Jack has played with 35 balls and caught 24 balls. Therefore, the final answer is: Jack plays with 11 balls (35 - 24).
Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs Elon can buy with $6.  If he buys 6 gumballs at $1 each, then he will spend $6. Now, we need to calculate how many gumballs he can buy if he spends $6. So, the answer is 6 gumballs.
Response:  We have to find out how many gumballs are in each jar and then add them up.  There are 6 jars of gumballs in total.  Each jar has 30 gumballs, so there are 30 x 6 = 180 gumballs in all. Therefore, there are 180 gumballs in the park.
Response:  We have to learn English for 2 hours and Chinese for 2 hours. So, in total we will spend 4 hours learning languages (English + Chinese). Now, if we spend 1 hour learning English and 30 minutes learning Chinese, then we will spend 1 hour + 30 minutes = 75 minutes per day. Therefore, it will take us 75 minutes / 60 minutes = 1.25 days to learn both English and Chinese.
Response:  We have to learn English for 7 hours and Chinese for 6 hours in total. So, we will spend 13 hours (7 + 6) learning languages altogether. Now, let's calculate how many minutes we will spend learning each language separately. To do this, we need to divide the total time spent learning languages by the number of hours we will spend learning each language. In this case, we will spend 7 hours learning English and 6 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, we will spend 7 x 60 = 420 minutes learning English and 6 x 60 = 360 minutes learning Chinese. So, our final answer is 420 minutes + 360 minutes = 780 minutes.
Response:  The person wants to learn English and Chinese for three hours every day. So, in total, they will spend 21 hours (3 hours x 7 days) learning both languages. Now, let's calculate how much time they will spend learning each language separately. For English, they will spend 7 hours (21 hours - 14 hours), and for Chinese, they will spend 14 hours (21 hours - 7 hours). Therefore, the person will spend 7 + 14 = 21 hours learning both languages altogether.
Response:  If an English course costs Rs. 200 per hour and you attend for 2 hours, then the total cost will be Rs. 400 (2 x 200). Now, if you switch to Chinese classes and pay Rs. 150 per hour, and you attend for 3 hours, then the total cost will be Rs. 450 (3 x 150). So, the difference in cost between attending English and Chinese classes is Rs. 150 (450 - 400).
Response:  If it takes 5 hours to learn Chinese in a day and you want to spend 2 hours learning English every day, how many days will it take to learn English?  We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so if we subtract the time spent learning Chinese (5 hours) from the total number of hours available for learning English (24 hours), we get 19 hours left over for learning English. Therefore, it will take approximately 19 days to learn English with this schedule.
Response:  We have to learn English for 5 days and Chinese for 7 days in total of 12 hours per day. So, we will spend 60 hours learning English and 49 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, the total cost would be $60 x 60 = $3600 for English and $49 x 7 = $333 for Chinese, adding up to a grand total of $3833.
Response:  We have to learn English for 5 hours and Hindi for 2 hours every day. So in total, we will spend 7 hours (5 + 2) learning languages daily. Now let's calculate how much time we will spend learning each language per hour. For English, we will spend 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week learning it. Similarly, for Hindi, we will spend 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week learning it. Therefore, we will spend 35 hours/week learning English and 14 hours/week learning Hindi.
Response:  If you learn Chinese for 6 hours a day for 8 days straight (i.e., 0.5 x 8 = 4), then in total, you will have learned Chinese for 4 hours.  So, if you continue learning Chinese at this rate every day for 12 more days (i.e., 0.5 x 12 = 6), you will have learned Chinese for a total of 10 hours (4 + 6).
Response:  The person wants to learn English for 8 hours and Chinese for 6 hours every day. So in total, they will spend 14 hours (8 + 6) per day studying languages. Now, if we calculate the number of days in 86 days, it comes out to be 1072 hours (86 days x 14 hours/day). Therefore, the person will study languages for approximately 1072 hours in 86 days.
Response:  We have to convert 7 hours into minutes and then convert 3 hours into minutes. So, total minutes = (7 x 60) + (3 x 60). Therefore, the answer is 420 minutes.
Response:  We have to calculate the total time spent in English and Spanish classes for each day of the week.  Monday - English class for 3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes Tuesday - Spanish class for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes Wednesday - English class for 4 hours = 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes Thursday - Spanish class for 5 hours = 5 x 60 minutes = 300 minutes Friday - English class for 3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes Saturday - Spanish class for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes Sunday - English class for 4 hours = 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes Total time spent in English classes per day = 180 + 180 + 240 + 240 = 920 minutes Total time spent in Spanish classes per day = 120 + 120 + 300 + 300 = 1260 minutes Now we need to convert these times into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: Total time spent in English classes per day = 920 / 60 = 15.33 hours Total time spent in Spanish classes per day = 1260 / 60 = 21.00 hours Therefore, the person spends 15.33 hours in English classes and 21.00 hours in Spanish classes every day.
Response:  We have to learn English for 6 hours, Chinese for 2 hours, and Spanish for 4 hours. So in total, we will spend 12 hours studying languages. Now let's calculate how much time each language takes per hour. For English, it is 6/1 = 6 hours per hour. For Chinese, it is 2/1 = 2 hours per hour. And for Spanish, it is 4/1 = 4 hours per hour. Therefore, if we study all three languages simultaneously, we will spend 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 hours studying them altogether.
"Response:  We have to convert 5 hours of English lessons into Spanish time and then compare it with 4 hours of Spanish lessons in Chinese time.

English lesson duration = 5 hours
Spanish lesson duration = 1 hour (as we know that 1 hour is equal to 0.25 English hours)
Chinese lesson duration = 4 hours (as we know that 1 Chinese hour is equal to 0.67 English hours)

Now, let's calculate the equivalent time in Chinese time:

English lesson duration in Chinese time = 5 hours x 0.67 = 3.35 hours

So, the equivalent time in Chinese time for 5 hours of English lessons is approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes or 3:20.

Similarly, we can calculate the equivalent time in Chinese time for 4 hours of Spanish lessons:

Spanish lesson duration in Chinese time = 4 hours x 0.67 = 2.68 hours

So, the equivalent time in Chinese time for 4 hours of Spanish lessons is approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes or 2:40.

Therefore, if you want to compare the time spent on English and Spanish lessons in Chinese time, you can say that you spend around 3:20 on English lessons and 2:40 on Spanish lessons."
Response:  The person wants to learn English and Chinese for 3 hours per day. So, in one week (7 days), they will have learned English for 21 hours (3 x 7) and Chinese for 42 hours (3 x 14). Therefore, the total time taken to learn both languages is 63 hours (21 + 42).
Response:  We have to learn English for 7 days and Chinese for 5 hours per day. So in total, we will spend 49 hours learning English and 250 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, the total time spent studying both languages is 301 hours.
Response:  We are given that Tifanny reselling her old laptop for $800 and she wants to know how much money she will have after selling it. So, we can start with the calculation as follows:  First day (Sunday): She sold the laptop for $800, so she gained $800 - $400 = $400. Second day (Monday): Since she already had $400 from the previous day, today she gained another $400 x 2 = $800. Third day (Tuesday): Now she has $1,200 ($400 + $800), so she gained $1,200 - $600 = $600. Fourth day (Wednesday): Again, since she already had $600 from the previous day, today she gained another $600 x 2 = $1,200. Fifth day (Thursday): Now she has $1,800 ($600 + $1,200), so she gained $1,800 - $900 = $900. Sixth day (Friday): Today she gained $900 x 2 = $1,800. Seventh day (Saturday): Finally, she gained $1,800 - $700 = $1,100. Therefore, the total amount of money Tifanny gained from selling her old laptop is $400 + $800 + $1,200 + $1,800 + $1,800 + $1,100 = $7,300.
"Response:  We are given that Tifanny reselling her old laptop for $700 and she wants to know how much money she can make in 14 days if she sells it every day. So, we need to calculate the total amount of money she can make in 14 days by selling the laptop every day.

Day 1: Tifanny sold the laptop for $700, so she made $700.

Day 2: She sold the laptop again for $700, so she made an additional $700, bringing the total to $1,400.

Day 3: She sold the laptop once more for $700, so she made an additional $700, bringing the total to $2,100.

And so on...

So, after 14 days, Tifanny will have made a total of $2,100 x 14 = $29,400!"
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money will be required for each day and then add it up to get the total amount needed for all six days.

Day 1: टिफनी रिसाइक्लिंग लेल डिब्बा जमा करैत छल (Rs 50) + सोमदिन ओ चारि बोरा डिब्बा लेने छल (Rs 200) = Rs 250

Day 2: दोसर दिन ओ किछु आओर बैग भेटलाह जाहिमे डिब्बाक मूल्य छल (Rs 300) = Rs 300

Total amount needed for all six days = Rs 250 + Rs 300 = Rs 550

Therefore, you would need Rs 550 in total for all six days of your trip."
Response:  We have to calculate how many bags of rice can be filled with 80 kg of rice in 7 days.  To do this, we need to divide the total weight of rice (80 kg) by the weight of each bag of rice (10 kg). So, we get:  Number of bags = Total weight / Weight per bag = 80 kg / 10 kg = 8 bags Now, let's check if it is possible to fill 8 bags of rice in 7 days. Yes, it is possible because we have 7 days and each day has 24 hours, so we have a total of 168 hours in 7 days. If we divide the number of bags by the number of hours available, we get: Number of bags per hour = Number of bags / Number of hours = 8 bags / 168 hours = 0.05 bags per hour Now, since we want to know how many bags can be filled in 7 days, we multiply the number of bags per hour by the number of hours available in 7 days: Number of bags filled in 7 days = Number of bags per hour x Number of hours in 7 days = 0.05 bags/hour x 168 hours = 8 bags Therefore, it is possible to fill 8 bags of rice in 7 days with 80 kg of rice.
Response:  We are given that Tifanny reselling 10 bags of rice every day and she has to sell them in sets of 3 bags each. So, total number of sets = Total number of bags / Number of bags per set = 10/3 = 3 sets. Now, we know that Tifanny sells 3 sets of bags every day, so total number of bags sold = Number of sets x Number of bags per set = 3 x 10 = 30 bags. Therefore, the final answer is 30 bags.
Response:  We are given that Tifanny reselling her old laptop for $800 and she spent $200 on it. So, her profit is $600 ($800 - $200). Now, we are asked how much bag of rice she can buy with this amount. To find out, we need to divide the profit by the cost of one bag of rice, which is $15 per kg. Therefore, Tifanny can buy 40 bags of rice with the profit she made from selling her old laptop ($600 / $15 = 40).
Response:  We are given that Tifanny reselling three bags of rice at Rs. 10 each and earning a profit of Rs. 2 per bag. So, she sold 3 x 3 = 9 bags of rice in total. Now, we are also given that Someday bought 7 bags of rice from Tifanny at Rs. 44 per bag. So, he paid her Rs. 7 x 7 = 49 rupees for those bags. Finally, we are told that Botak bought 4 bags of rice from Someday at Rs. 56 per bag. So, he paid him Rs. 56 x 4 = 224 rupees for those bags. Therefore, the total amount of money that Botak gave to Someday was Rs. 224.
Response:  We have 17 balls in total and we need to find out how many of them are red. So, the number of red balls is 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there is one red ball among the 17 balls.
Response:  We have 5 red balls and 11 blue balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many red balls are there in 3 baskets. So, let's divide the total number of balls by 3.  Therefore, the number of red balls in each basket is : 5/3 = 1 red ball per basket.
"Response:  We have 15 tonnes of wheat and we want to know how many bags of 50 kg each can be filled from it. So, we need to divide the total weight of wheat by the weight of one bag.  Therefore, the number of bags that can be filled is:

15 tonnes = 15 x 1000 kg = 15,000 kg

Now, let's convert this amount to bags of 50 kg each:

15,000 kg / 50 kg per bag = 300 bags

So, there are 300 bags of 50 kg each that can be filled from 15 tonnes of wheat."
Response:  We have three red balls and five white balls in total. If we take out one red ball from the urn, there will be two red balls left. Now, if we put one white ball into the urn, there will be six white balls in the urn (including the one that was already there). So, after putting one white ball into the urn, the ratio of red to white balls is still 3:5. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red ball from the urn is still 3/8.
Response:  We have 6 red apples and 5 green apples in total. Now we want to know how many apples are there in the basket. So, if we divide the total number of apples (6 + 5 = 11) by the number of baskets (2), then we get the answer - 5 apples in each basket. Therefore, there are 5 apples in the basket.
Response:  We have 6 red apples and 7 green apples in total. If we take away 3 green apples from them, how many will be left with us? So, there will be 6 + 7 - 3 = 10 apples left with us.
Response:  We have 2 red apples and 6 green apples in total. Out of these, 4 are ripe (red) and 10 are unripe (green). So, there are 4 + 10 = 14 apples in total.
Response:  We have 19 red apples and 11 green apples. If we want to make a basket of equal weight with both types of apples, how much will each type of apple weigh?  Red apples weigh 100 grams each, so 19 red apples will be 19 x 100 = 1900 grams. Green apples weigh 50 grams each, so 11 green apples will be 11 x 50 = 550 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the basket is 1900 + 550 = 2450 grams.
Response:  We have to find out how many laal aadus (red beans) are needed for 90 piela aadus (black beans). So, we divide 90 by 3 (since each black bean requires 3 red beans). Therefore, we need 30 red beans for 90 black beans. Now, we have to find out how many harirya aadus (split beans) are required for 16 addu (beans). Since each split bean requires 2 whole beans, we multiply 16 by 2 to get 32 whole beans. Finally, we subtract the number of whole beans that can fit in a basket from the total number of beans to determine how many baskets are required. In this case, since one basket can hold 8 whole beans, we subtract 32 from 80 to get 48 baskets.
"Response:  We have 18 red balls and 14 blue balls in total.  Since there are more red balls than blue balls, we will get more red balls when we randomly select one ball from the basket. So, the probability of getting a red ball is higher than that of getting a blue ball. Therefore, the answer is:

Red Ball : 9 (probability = 5/9) Blue Ball : 5 (probability = 4/9)"
Response:  We have 5 red apples and 14 green apples. If we take away 6 from the total number of apples, how many will be left? So, there will be 9 (5 + 14 - 6) apples left. Now, among these 9 apples, how many are red? Well, out of 5 red apples, 3 were taken away, so now there are only 2 red apples left. And among the remaining 9 apples, how many are green? There were originally 14 green apples, so among the remaining 9 apples, there are still 5 green apples. Therefore, the final answer is 2 red apples and 5 green apples.
Response:  We have 65 tokers in total and each toker has 3 haris (hair) and 2 lalas (teeth). So, the total number of hairs = 65 x 3 = 195 hairs And the total number of teeth = 65 x 2 = 130 teeth Therefore, there are 195 hairs and 130 teeth among all the tokers.
Response:  We have 11 tokers and each toker has 10 lalas and 18 haris. So, total number of lalas = 10 x 11 = 110 lalas. Total number of haris = 18 x 11 = 208 haris. Therefore, total number of addu (lalas + haris) = 110 + 208 = 318 addu.
Response:  We have 6 tokers and each toker has 16 lal (balls) in one basket and 18 harier (baskets) in another basket. So, total number of balls = Number of baskets x Number of balls in each basket. Therefore, Total number of balls = 6 x 16 = 96.
Response:  We have 10 tokers and each toker has 2 haris (baskets) of 10 alu each. So, in total we have 200 alus (10 x 20). Now, let's calculate how many baskets are there in total. Since each basket contains 10 alus, the total number of baskets is 200 / 10 = 20 baskets. Therefore, there are 20 baskets of alus.
Response:  We have 4 large apples and 3 small apples in each tokri. So, total number of apples = 4 x 3 + 3 = 15 apples. If we have 7 tokris, then total number of apples = 7 x 15 = 105 apples.
Response:  We have 12 tokers and each toker has 4 bags of rice (30 kg each). So, total number of bags of rice = 12 x 4 = 48 bags.
Response:  We have 16 tokers in total and each toker has 4 adjoining cells. So, the total number of cells adjacent to each toker is 4 x 16 = 64. Now, we are told that there are 13 red balls in one basket and some more balls in another basket. Since there are more balls in the other basket than in the first basket, let's assume that there are 13 + x red balls in the second basket, where x is a positive integer. Therefore, the total number of red balls = 13 + x. Now, we need to find out how many red balls are adjacent to each toker. Since each toker has 4 adjacent cells, and each cell can hold at most 2 red balls (as per the given information), the total number of red balls adjacent to each toker is 4 x 2 = 8. So, the number of red balls adjacent to each toker is 8. Finally, since there are 16 tokers in total, the total number of red balls adjacent to all tokers is 16 x 8 = 128.
Response:  We have 19 small balls and 4 large balls. If we take 15 of them as tokens, then how many small balls are left? Small balls = 19 - 15 = 4. So, there are 4 small balls remaining in the container after taking 15 tokens.
"Response:  We have to find out how many full and half tokens are there in each token box. Then we will know how many full and half tokens are needed for 10 tokens.  So let's count the number of full and half tokens in each token box:

Token Box 1: 4 full tokens + 2 half tokens = 6 tokens Total
Token Box 2: 3 full tokens + 3 half tokens = 6 tokens Total
Token Box 3: 5 full tokens + 1 half token = 6 tokens Total
Token Box 4: 4 full tokens + 2 half tokens = 6 tokens Total
Total Number of Full Tokens: 18 (4 x 4)
Total Number of Half Tokens: 12 (2 x 6)
Now, we need 10 tokens, so we will take 6 full tokens and 4 half tokens from these boxes:
Full Tokens: 6 (from Token Boxes 1, 2, and 4)
Half Tokens: 4 (from Token Box 3)
So, the total number of tokens required is 10."
Response:  We have 6 large apples and 60 small apples. If we take away 2 large apples from them, how many will be left? So, there will be 58 small apples and 4 large apples left.
Response:  We have to find out how many units of each type are required to fill up the entire container (shelf) with a total capacity of 8 tons.  Since there are 100 units of each type, we can calculate the number of units needed for each type as follows:  For Type A: Number of units = Total capacity of shelf / Capacity of one unit = 8 tons / 2 tons = 4 units  For Type B: Number of units = Total capacity of shelf / Capacity of one unit = 8 tons / 3 tons = 2.67 units (round off to 2 units)  Therefore, we need 4 + 2 = 6 units of Type A and 2 units of Type B to fill up the entire shelf.
Response:  We have to find out how many questions are there in total and then divide it equally among the seven shelves. So, we can calculate the number of questions per shelf as follows: Total number of questions = 7 x 10 = 70 Questions Now, let's assume that each shelf has space for 10 questions. Therefore, the number of questions that will fit on each shelf is: Number of questions per shelf = 70 / 10 = 7 shelves With this calculation, we can conclude that there will be 7 questions on each of the seven shelves.
Response:  We have to find out how many questions are there in total and then calculate the percentage of correct answers.  So, let's break down the given information:  There are 22 questions in total. Out of these, Jeremy answered 10 correctly, which means he got 45% of the questions right (10/22 x 100%). Now, we need to find out how many questions Owen answered correctly. He answered 6 out of 10 questions correctly, which means he got 60% of the questions right (6/10 x 100%). Therefore, the final percentage of correct answers is: (45 + 60) / 2 = 85%.
Response:  We have a shelf with 5 boxes of weight 10 kg each and 9 books of weight 2 kg each. After placing these items on the shelf, there are 7 boxes left on the shelf. If we remove 3 boxes from the shelf, how many books will be left on it? Books - 3 = 6
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 10 appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of digits in each word and then adding them up.  For example, the first word ""जेरीक"" has 4 digits, the second word ""कमरामे"" has 6 digits, and so on. Therefore, the total number of digits in the given text is: 4 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 17 digits. Now, we need to divide the total number of digits by 10 to get the approximate number of times the digit 10 appears in the text. So, 17 digits / 10 = approximately 1.7 times. Since we are asked for an exact number, let's round off the result to 2 times. Therefore, there are approximately 2 times the number 10 in the given text."
Response:  We have to find out how many books Jerry can carry in one trip.  Firstly, we know that Jerry can carry 10 boxes at once.  Now, each box contains 5 books, so he can carry 5 x 10 = 50 books in total.  Therefore, the answer is 50 books.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much space is available in the shelf for storing books. The question states that there are 7 large boxes and each box contains 2 tonnes of books, so the total weight of books that can be stored in the shelf is:

7 boxes x 2 tonnes/box = 14 tonnes

Now, we need to calculate the volume of the shelf. Since the question does not provide any information about the dimensions of the shelf, let's assume it is rectangular in shape with length, breadth, and height as L, B, and H meters respectively. Then, the volume of the shelf can be calculated as:

Volume of shelf = L x B x H cubic meters

Since the question states that the shelf has a capacity of 7 tonnes, we can set up the following equation:

Volume of shelf = 7 tonnes / (weight per unit volume)

where weight per unit volume is the density of the books, which is given as 1.5 tonnes/cubic meter. So, we can substitute this value in the previous equation:

Volume of shelf = 7 tonnes / (1.5 tonnes/cubic meter) = 4.67 cubic meters

Therefore, the volume of the shelf is approximately 4.67 cubic meters. Now, we need to convert this volume from cubic meters to liters. There are 1000 liters in one cubic meter, so:

Volume of shelf in liters = 4.67 cubic meters x 1000 liters/cubic meter = 4670 liters

Finally, we can divide the total weight of books by the volume of the shelf to get the number of books that can fit in the shelf:

Number of books that can fit in the shelf = Total weight of books / Volume of shelf
= 14 tonnes / 4670 liters
= 30.38 books

So, approximately 30 books can fit in the shelf."
Response:  We have to find out how much space is required for each book and then add it up to get the total space required.  Book size = 5 x 2 = 10 square feet (assuming each book is 2 square feet in size) Total space required = 9 x 10 = 90 square feet (as there are 9 books in total) So, the total space required to place all 9 books on the shelf is 90 square feet.
Response:  We have to find out how many questions are there in total and then calculate the percentage of correct answers.  So, let's break down the given information:  There are 5 options for each question, so the total number of questions is 5 x 4 = 20 questions. Now, we need to find out how many questions were answered correctly. From the given information, we know that out of 20 questions, 17 were answered correctly, which means that 85% of the questions were answered correctly (17/20 x 100%). Therefore, the answer is 85%.
Response:  We have to find out how many tones of coal can be placed in Jeremy's room if he has already placed three tons there and wants to add more after removing four old ones. So, we need to calculate the total capacity of Jeremy's room for storing coal. The room is 60 cubic feet in volume, and each ton of coal occupies 72 cubic feet. Therefore, the total capacity of the room for storing coal = 60 cubic feet x (1 / 72) = 9 tons. Now, Jeremy has already placed three tons of coal in his room, so the remaining capacity = total capacity - amount already used = 9 tons - 3 tons = 6 tons. If he removes four old tons of coal from the room, then the available space for new coal = remaining capacity - amount removed = 6 tons - 4 tons = 2 tons.
Response:  We have to find out how many tonnes of soil can be filled in the pit after removing 10 tonnes of old excavation from it. Soil weight = Density of soil x Volume of soil  In this case, we don't know the density of soil, but let's assume an average density of soil as 1500 kg/m3 (which is a reasonable estimate). Now, we need to calculate the volume of soil that can be filled in the pit after removing 10 tonnes of old excavation. Volume of soil = Depth of pit x Width of pit x Length of pit (in m) Since we are given that the depth of the pit is 20 m, width is 10 m, and length is 20 m, we can calculate the volume of soil as follows: Volume of soil = 20 m x 10 m x 20 m = 4000 cubic meters Now, we need to convert the volume of soil from cubic meters to tonnes. We know that 1 cubic meter of soil weighs approximately 1500 kg, so: Tonnes of soil = Volume of soil x Density of soil / 1000 (since there are 1000 kg in 1 tonne) Tonnes of soil = 4000 cubic meters x 1500 kg/m3 / 1000 = 6000 kg or 6 tonnes Therefore, after removing 10 tonnes of old excavation from the pit, we can fill 6 tonnes of soil in the remaining space.
Response:  We have to find out how many tonnes of soil can be added to the existing pit without exceeding its capacity. Soil weight = Density of soil x Volume of soil  In this case, we are given that the volume of the existing pit is 20 cubic meters and the density of soil is 1.6 tons/cubic meter. Therefore, the total weight of soil in the existing pit = 20 cubic meters x 1.6 tons/cubic meter = 32 tons Now, we need to calculate how much more soil can be added to the existing pit without exceeding its capacity. Existing capacity - Total weight of soil in the existing pit = 7 tons (as per the question) So, we can add up to 7 tons of soil to the existing pit without exceeding its capacity.
Response:  Jerry has 9 boxes of books with him and he wants to pack them in his car. He has already packed 7 boxes into his car. If he adds another 10 boxes, how many boxes will he have in total? So, the answer is 16 (9 + 7 = 16).
Response:  We have three books and we want to know how many questions each book has. So, let's assume that each book contains 10 questions. Therefore, the total number of questions = Number of books x Number of questions per book = 3 x 10 = 30 questions. Now, after solving the first three questions, there are 27 remaining questions (30 - 3).
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 3 appears in the book and then divide it by 10. So, we will count the number of times the digit 3 appears in each page of the book and multiply it by 10. Now, let's calculate the total number of pages in the book. If there are 72 pages in the book, then the number of times the digit 3 appears in each page is 72 / 10 = 7. So, the total number of times the digit 3 appears in the book is 7 x 3 = 21. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  We have to find out how many tires are needed for 6 bags of rice.  Each bag of rice weighs 50 kg, so altogether we need 6 x 50 = 300 kg of weight capacity in our tires. Since each tire can carry 1.5 tons (or 1500 kg) of weight, we need 300/1500 = 2 tires to transport all 6 bags of rice. Therefore, there will be 2 tires on the truck carrying those 6 bags of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many chidiyaas (toys) are there in total and then calculate the number of chidiyas that can fit on each bad (stick).  So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many chidiyas are there in total?  Based on the given information, we know that there are 5 trays of chidiyas, and each tray has 8 chidiyas. Therefore, the total number of chidiyas = 5 x 8 = 40 chidiyas. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question - How many chidiyas can fit on each bad? According to the question, each bad can hold 3 chidiyas. So, to find out how many chidiyas can fit on each bad, we divide the total number of chidiyas by the number of bads: Total number of chidiyas / Number of bads = 40 chidiyas / 5 bads = 8 chidiyas per bad.
Response:  We have to find out how many tires are there in total and then calculate the percentage of tires that are worn out.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 46 tires in total. Out of these, 6 tires are worn out completely (80%). Now, we need to find out how many tires are left after deducting the worn-out ones. Therefore, the number of remaining tires is: 46 - 6 = 40 tires. So, the percentage of tires that are worn out is: (6/46) x 100% = 80%.
Response:  We have three turtles (3) and five tortoises (5). Now, we need to find out how many will be left after crossing the river.  So, we multiply the number of turtles with the number of tortoises: 3 x 5 = 15. Therefore, there will be 15 turtles and tortoises left after crossing the river.
Response:  We have three goats (G1, G2, and G3) standing on four bags of wheat (W1, W2, W3, and W4). Each bag of wheat has a weight of 50 kg. Now, we need to calculate how much weight each goat will carry after eating one-third of the wheat in each bag. So, for Goat 1 (G1), it will eat one-third of W1 = 16.7 kg (since W1 x 1/3 = 16.7 kg). Similarly, Goat 2 (G2) will eat one-third of W2 = 16.7 kg, and Goat 3 (G3) will eat one-third of W3 = 16.7 kg. Therefore, the total weight carried by all three goats is: G1 + G2 + G3 = 16.7 kg + 16.7 kg + 16.7 kg = 59.1 kg.
Response:  We have to find out how many tamarinds are required to fill three baskets of size 6 tamarinds each. So, we need to divide 18 (the total number of tamarinds) by 3 (the number of baskets). Therefore, the answer is 6 tamarinds per basket. Now, let's calculate how many tamarinds will be required for 7 baskets. We multiply 6 with 7, which gives us 42 tamarinds. So, there will be 42 tamarinds in total.
Response:  We have 4 tires and we need to fill them with air. Each tire requires 32 liters of air. So, in total, we need 4 x 32 = 128 liters of air. Now, let's assume that each liter of air costs Rs. 50. Therefore, the total cost of filling all four tires with air is 128 x 50 = Rs. 6400.
Response:  We have three goats and four bags of rice. Each bag contains six tonnes of rice. So, in total, we have 3 x 4 = 12 tonnes of rice. Now, each goat can eat one tonne of rice per day. Therefore, it will take 12 / 1 = 12 days for all three goats to eat all the rice.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""chid"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""chid"" appears three times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  We have 3 crows and 3 dogs. Each crow can carry 4 bags of rice. So, total number of bags carried by crows = 3 x 4 = 12 bags. Similarly, each dog can carry 5 bags of rice. So, total number of bags carried by dogs = 3 x 5 = 15 bags. Now, we need to find out how many bags of rice are left after both crows and dogs have carried their respective loads. Total number of bags of rice left = Number of bags carried by crows - Number of bags carried by dogs = 12 - 15 = -3 bags. Therefore, there are -3 bags of rice left.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""chal"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""chal"" appears three times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the word ""chid"" appears in the given text.  The word ""chid"" appears three times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  We have three turtles (3) and six birds (6). The turtles are sitting on one bad (1), so there is one bad with three turtles on it. Now, we need to find out how many birds can sit on one bad. There are six birds (6), but they cannot all fit on one bad because there is only one bad available. So, the answer is 0.
"Response:  We have five bags of rice (5), three bags of wheat (3), and one bag of barley (1). Now we need to distribute these grains among six people equally. So, each person will get: 5/6 x 3 = 2 bags of rice; 3/6 x 1 = 0.5 bags of wheat; and 1/6 x 1 = 0.17 bags of barley. Therefore, the total amount of grain each person will receive is: 2 + 0.5 + 0.17 = 2.67 bags of grains."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the word ""garud"" appears in the given text. We can see that the word ""garud"" appears three times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  We have three turtles (3) and six frogs (6). The total number of creatures is therefore 3 + 6 = 9. Now, we are asked how many will be left if five turtles (5) and two frogs (2) go away. So, the remaining creatures after they leave are 9 - 5 - 2 = 2. Therefore, there will be two creatures left on the log.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 48 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is: 2 x 48 = 96 pages. Now, we need to find out how many pages have been read from the first chapter. Since the first chapter has 48 pages, if 11 pages have been read from it, then the remaining pages are: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the number of pages left to be read from the first chapter is 37 pages.
Response:  In the first chapter of the book, there are 37 pages.  In the second chapter, there are 80 pages. So, in total, there are 37 + 80 = 117 pages in the two chapters combined.
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has 60 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 2 x 60 = 120 pages Now, we want to find out how many pages are there in the second chapter. If there are 93 pages in the entire book, then the number of pages in the second chapter is: Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter = 120 - 60 = 60 pages Therefore, there are 60 pages in the second chapter of the book.
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has 36 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 2 x 36 = 72 pages Now, we want to find out how many pages are in the first chapter. Since there are 72 pages in the book and the first chapter contains 20 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in the first chapter = 72 - 20 = 52 pages Therefore, the first chapter contains 52 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book. So, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter.  Now, let's calculate the number of pages in each chapter:  Chapter 1 has 66 pages, Chapter 2 has 35 pages, and Chapter 3 has 24 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:  Total Number of Pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 91 pages. So, the total number of pages in all three chapters is: 3 x 91 = 273 pages. Now, we need to find out how many pages have been read so far. In the first chapter, 23 pages have been read, which means that the remaining pages are: 273 - 23 = 250 pages. Similarly, in the second chapter, 25 pages have been read, leaving behind 228 pages (273 - 25 = 228). Finally, in the third chapter, 25 pages have been read, resulting in 203 pages left unread (273 - 25 = 203). Therefore, the answer to the question is: 203 pages.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book. The first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter has 18 pages, and the third chapter has 3 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:  First Chapter: 35 pages × 1 = 35 Second Chapter: 18 pages × 2 = 36 Third Chapter: 3 pages × 1 = 3 Total Number of Pages: 35 + 36 + 3 = 74 Therefore, there are 74 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 53 pages. So, the total number of pages in all three chapters is:  Chapter 1: 53 pages x 2 = 106 pages Chapter 2: 53 pages x 3 = 159 pages Chapter 3: 53 pages x 4 = 224 pages Now, we need to find out how many pages have been read so far. Let's assume that the person has read half of Chapter 1 (which is 53 pages) and half of Chapter 2 (which is 75 pages). So, the total number of pages read so far is: Half of Chapter 1: 53 pages x 2 = 106 pages Half of Chapter 2: 75 pages x 2 = 150 pages Total number of pages read so far: 106 + 150 = 256 pages Therefore, the person has read 256 pages out of a total of 686 pages in the three chapters.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1831 pages. Therefore, the correct answer is 1831 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter has 10 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is: 2 x 10 = 20 pages.
Response:  We know that there are 81 pages in the book and we have to find out how many pages are there between two consecutive chapters. So, let's assume the first chapter starts from page 1 and ends at page 2 (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the distance between the first chapter and the second chapter is 3 pages (i.e., page 2 - page 1 = 3). Similarly, the distance between the second chapter and the third chapter is also 3 pages (i.e., page 68 - page 65 = 3). Thus, there are 3 pages between each consecutive chapter.
"Response:  We know that there are 62 tonnes of rice in one camp and 39 tonnes of rice in another camp. So, if we divide the total amount of rice in both camps (101 tonnes), we get:

Ratio of rice in first camp to rice in second camp = 62/39 = 1.54

So, there are approximately 1.54 times more rice in the first camp than in the second camp."
Response:  We know that there are 52 tents in total and 61 people who have died of cold in them. Now, we need to find out how many people have died in each tent. To do this, we will divide the number of deaths (61) by the total number of tents (52). So, the number of people who have died in each tent is: 61 / 52 = 1.17  Since there are more than one person in each tent, we will round off the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is 1 tent has 1 or more dead bodies.
Response:  We know that there are 32 campers in total and they have to share the tents equally among themselves. Since each camper has to sleep in one tent, we can assume that each tent will accommodate 4 campers (since there are 32 / 8 = 4 tents). Now, let's calculate how many campers will be sleeping during the afternoon session of Day 2. If all 32 campers attend the afternoon session, then 8 campers ( since there are 32 / 4 = 8 campers) will be sleeping during this time. So, the answer is 8.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 campers in total and they have been suffering from diarrhea for 3 days each. So, the total number of days they have suffered from diarrhea is:

7 campers x 3 days per camper = 21 days

Now, we need to find out how many campers are left without diarrhea. Since 60 campers were initially present, and 7 had diarrhea, the remaining number of campers without diarrhea is:

60 campers - 7 campers with diarrhea = 53 campers

So, the percentage of campers who do not have diarrhea is:

(53 campers without diarrhea / 60 initial campers) x 100% = 88.33%

Therefore, approximately 88.33% of the campers do not have diarrhea."
Response:  We have 36 tonnes of rice in one camp and 13 tonnes in another camp. If we add both these amounts together, we get 49 tonnes of rice in total. So, the correct answer is (D) 49 tonnes.
Response:  We have to compare the number of campers in each location during different times of the day.  During the morning (6 AM - 12 PM), there are 44 campers at Boromeo and 39 campers at Dupaharme.  Therefore, the difference between the two locations is 5 campers (44 - 39 = 5).  Now let's move on to the afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM) when there are 31 campers at Sanchame and 39 campers at Dupaharme.  So, the difference between these two locations is 2 campers (31 - 39 = -8).  Finally, we need to find out which location has more campers overall.  Since Boromeo has 44 campers during the morning and 31 campers during the afternoon, its total number of campers is 75 (44 + 31 = 75).  On the other hand, Sanchame has 31 campers during both the morning and afternoon, so its total number of campers is also 75 (31 + 31 = 75).  Thus, neither location has more campers than the other overall.
Response:  We have 53 tonnes of rice in one camp and 48 tonnes of rice in another camp. Additionally, there are 49 tonnes of rice that were taken away from the second camp. So, the total amount of rice available at both camps is: 53 + 48 = 101 tonnes. Now, let's calculate how much rice each person in the first camp has: 101 / 2 (number of people) = x tonnes per person. Since there are 49 tonnes less than what was initially present in the second camp, we can conclude that each person in the second camp has: x - 49 = y tonnes of rice.
Response:  We have 33 tonnes of coal in one camp and 34 tonnes of coal in another camp at different times (33 + 34 = 67 tonnes). Now, we need to calculate how much coal is left after 10 tonnes are taken out from both camps. So, the remaining amount of coal in both camps will be: 67 - 10 = 57 tonnes.
Response:  We know that there are 13 tents in one camp and 59 tents in another camp. So, the total number of tents in both camps is: 13 + 59 = 72 tents. Now, we know that 21 tents were destroyed in one camp during heavy rain. So, the remaining number of tents in that camp is: 72 - 21 = 51 tents. Similarly, we can calculate the number of tents in the other camp as follows: Number of tents in the other camp = Total number of tents in both camps - Number of tents destroyed in the first camp = 72 - 21 = 51 tents. Therefore, the total number of tents in both camps that were not destroyed during heavy rain is: 51 tents from the first camp and 51 tents from the second camp = 102 tents.
"Response:  We know that 29 campers went for a trek and returned after 6 days. So, the total number of days they spent on the trek is:

29 campers x 6 days = 174 days

Now, we are told that 26 campers were left behind due to illness. So, the total number of days these campers spent on the trek is:

26 campers x (number of days they spent on the trek) = 26 x 174 = 4508 days

Therefore, the difference between the number of days the 29 campers spent on the trek and the number of days the 26 campers spent on the trek is:

4508 days - 174 days = 4334 days

So, there are 4334 more days than the number of days the 29 campers spent on the trek."
Response:  We know that there are 41 tents in total and 26 of them are in the camping site. So, we have to find out how many tents are not in the camping site. To do this, we need to subtract the number of tents in the camping site from the total number of tents. Therefore, the answer is: 41 - 26 = 15 tents outside the camping site.
Response:  We know that in one day there are 46 tents and 43 tents are occupied at night. So, we have 3 unoccupied tents during the daytime (46 - 43 = 3).
"Response:  If Rahul has 7 tons of sugarcane and he wants to sell it at Rs. 10 per kilogram, then:

Total amount of money that Rahul can earn from selling his 7 tons of sugarcane = Number of kilograms of sugarcane x Selling price per kilogram
= 7 tons x Rs. 10 per kg
= Rs. 70,000 (approximately)
So, if Rahul starts selling his sugarcane at Rs. 10 per kilogram, he can expect to earn around Rs. 70,000 based on this calculation."
Response:  We have 4 seeds to start with and we need to plant them in different parts of the garden. Let's assume that each seed can grow into 3 plants (this is an average number). So, after planting all 4 seeds, we will have 12 plants growing in the garden. Now, let's consider how many seeds will be left for next year's crop. If we want to maintain a balance of 4 seeds per year, then we will need to harvest 3 seeds from this year's crop (since there are already 12 plants growing) and save them for next year. Therefore, the answer is 3 seeds.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are there in total and then divide them equally among five people. So, firstly we need to count the number of apples available. According to the question, there are 7 apples in total. Now, let's assume that each person gets an equal share of apples. Since there are 5 people, each person will get : 7 apples / 5 = 1 apple per person. Therefore, each person will get 1 apple.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in one gram of each type of apple.  For this, we will use the following formula: Number of seeds = Total weight of apples / Weight of one seed.  Now, let's calculate the total weight of apples: 700 grams (as given in the question) x 6 = 4200 grams.  Next, we need to find out the weight of one seed. Unfortunately, there is no direct information available about the weight of an apple seed. However, we can estimate it based on the size and shape of the seed. Assuming that an average apple seed weighs around 0.1-0.2 grams, we can calculate the number of seeds as follows: Number of seeds = 4200 grams / 0.1 grams per seed = 42000 seeds. Therefore, there are approximately 42,000 seeds in 700 grams of apples.
"Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in 6 big apples and then calculate how many small apples will be obtained if we divide them into 2 equal parts of 4 each. Finally, we need to determine how many seeds there are in one small apple. Here is the calculation:

Number of seeds in 6 big apples = Number of seeds per apple x Number of big apples
= 4 seeds/apple x 6 apples
= 24 seeds

Now, let's divide 24 seeds equally among 2 groups of 4 apples each:

Group 1 (4 apples): 24 seeds / 4 apples = 6 seeds per apple
Group 2 (4 apples): 24 seeds / 4 apples = 6 seeds per apple

So, there are 6 seeds in each of the 4 small apples in Group 1 and 6 seeds in each of the 4 small apples in Group 2.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Number of seeds in one small apple = 6 seeds"
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in three packets of wheat flour and then divide it by two to get the number of seeds per packet.  So, let's first calculate the total number of seeds in three packets of wheat flour:  Three packets of wheat flour contain 27 apples + 30 apples = 57 apples. Now, we need to divide this number by two to get the number of seeds per packet:  Therefore, there are 57 apples / 2 = 28.5 seeds per packet of wheat flour.
"Response:  Rahul has 7 seeds of wheat and he wants to plant them in his garden. He plants 3 seeds in each row and has 2 rows of wheat. Therefore, the total number of wheat plants that Rahul will have is:

Number of seeds = 7
Rows = 2
Seeds per row = 3
Total number of wheat plants = Number of seeds x Rows x Seeds per row
= 7 x 2 x 3 = 42 wheat plants
So, there are 42 wheat plants in Rahul's garden."
Response:  Firstly, Rahul gave three apples to Gaurav. Then, Gaurav divided them equally among four of his friends, so each friend got one apple. Now, there are three apples left with Gaurav. Therefore, the final number of apples with Gaurav is 3.
"Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in one gram of sugarcane juice.  Firstly, we know that there are approximately 20-25 seeds in one sugarcane stalk. So, if we take an average of 22 seeds per stalk, then:

 Number of seeds in one sugarcane stalk = 22 seeds

Now, we need to convert grams to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram. So, if we want to find out how many seeds are in one kilogram of sugarcane juice, we can use the following formula:

Number of seeds in one kilogram of sugarcane juice = Number of seeds in one sugarcane stalk x Number of grams in one kilogram
= 22 seeds/stalk x 1000 grams/kilogram
= 2200 seeds/kilogram

Finally, we need to convert kilograms to grams. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram. So, if we want to find out how many seeds are in one gram of sugarcane juice, we can use the following formula:

Number of seeds in one gram of sugarcane juice = Number of seeds in one kilogram of sugarcane juice / Number of grams in one kilogram
= 2200 seeds/kilogram / 1000 grams/kilogram
= 2.2 seeds/gram

So, there are approximately 2.2 seeds in one gram of sugarcane juice."
Response:  We have to choose 3 apples from the basket of 9 apples. So, we can choose any 3 apples and leave the remaining 6 apples in the basket. Now, let's assume that each apple is equally likely to be chosen. Therefore, the probability of choosing each apple is 1/9. Since there are 3 apples to be chosen, the total number of ways to choose them is 3! = 6. So, the expected value of the number of apples chosen is 6 × 1/9 = 7.
Response:  Rahul has 4 cars and each car can carry 7 bags of sugar. So, in total, he can carry 28 bags of sugar (4 x 7 = 28). Now, let's find out how many bags of sugar Rahul will buy if he wants to buy all the sugar available at the market.
Response:  We have to find out how many bulbuls are there in the field of ed. The question is asking about the number of bulbuls that can be seen in the field of ed. So, we need to count the number of bulbuls in the field of ed. According to the question, there are 19 gots in the field of ed. Now, each got has 5 bulbuls. Therefore, the total number of bulbuls in the field of ed is 19 x 5 = 95 bulbuls.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Ed can throw in one minute if he has 45 golf balls and each ball weighs 0.1 kg.  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken by Ed to throw one ball. As per the question, Ed takes 11 seconds to throw one ball. So, the total time taken by Ed to throw all 45 balls is: Time = Number of balls x Throwing time/Throwing speed Where throwing speed is the time taken to throw one ball. In this case, it is 11 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by Ed to throw all 45 balls is: Time = 45 x 11 / 10 = 495 seconds or 8 minutes and 25 seconds. Now, let's find out how many balls Ed can throw in one minute. To do this, we will divide the total time taken by Ed to throw all 45 balls by 60 (the number of seconds in one minute). This gives us: Balls thrown in one minute = Total time / 60 = 495 / 60 = 8.625 balls per minute Now, since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we can simplify the calculation as follows: Balls thrown in one minute = 8.625 x 60 = 505 balls per minute. Therefore, Ed can throw approximately 505 balls in one minute with 45 golf balls and taking 11 seconds to throw each ball.
Response:  We know that there are 6 goats in total and each goat has 2 babies (goblins). So, we have a total of 12 goblins. Now, let's see how many goblins will be left after 22 years. If one goat gives birth to two goblins every year, then in 22 years, it will give birth to 2 x 22 = 44 goblins. But we already have 12 goblins, so the remaining number of goblins is 44 - 12 = 32 goblins. Therefore, there will be 32 goblins left after 22 years.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Ed can throw in total and then calculate how many balls he will throw per minute.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many balls does Ed have?  According to the question, Ed has 5 bags of marbles, each bag contains 27 marbles. Therefore, Ed has a total of 5 x 27 = 135 marbles. Now, we need to calculate how many minutes it takes for Ed to throw all these marbles. As per the second part of the question, Ed throws one ball every 30 seconds. So, if Ed starts throwing marbles at this rate, it will take him (135 marbles / 30 seconds per marble) = 4.5 minutes to throw all the marbles.
Response:  We know that there are 27 goats in total and each goat has 9 kids. So, the total number of goats including the mother is 27 + 9 = 36 goats. Now, we need to find out how many goats are left after 24 hours have passed. As per the question, 24 goats were sold during this time period, so the remaining goats are 36 - 24 = 12 goats. Therefore, the answer is 12 goats.
"Response:  We know that Ed has 29 goats and he sold 17 of them in the market at Rs. 50 per goat. So, Ed got Rs. 855 from selling those goats (17 x 50 = 855). Now, we are asked how much money did Ed have left after selling those goats. To find this out, we need to subtract the amount Ed got from selling the goats from his initial total amount of money. Therefore, the answer is:  Ed had Rs. 640 left after selling the goats (29 - 17 = 12; 855 - 855 = 0)."
Response:  We know that there are 19 bulbs in total and Ed has already lit 8 of them. So, we have to find out how many bulbs will be left unlit after Ed lights all the bulbs he can. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bulbs Ed has already lit from the total number of bulbs. Therefore, the answer is:  There will be 11 bulbs left unlit after Ed lights all the bulbs he can (19 - 8 = 11).
Response:  We know that there are 30 dogs in total and each dog has 21 gots (bones). So, the total number of gots is 30 x 21 = 630 gots. Now, we need to find out how many gots Ed took from the field. According to the question, Ed took 21 gots from the field, which means he left with 630 - 21 = 609 gots. Finally, we need to calculate how much money Ed made selling those gots. Since each got costs 50 paise, Ed made 609 x 50 = Rs. 304.50.
"Response:  We have to find out how many goblins can fit in each square of the grid and then calculate the total number of goblins that can be placed in the entire grid.

Firstly, we need to determine the size of each square in the grid. According to the question, each square measures 12 feet by 12 feet, which means each square has an area of 144 square feet (12 x 12 = 144).

Next, we need to find out how many goblins can fit in each square. The question states that there are 20 goblins in total, and they are bulbuls (which means they are small in size). So, let's assume each goblin takes up an area of 1 square foot (a rough estimate since we don't know their exact size). Therefore, we can fit 20/144 = 0.136 goblins in each square (round it off to 0.14 goblins per square for simplicity).

Now, let's calculate the total number of goblins that can be placed in the entire grid. Since the grid consists of 12 rows and 12 columns, the total area of the grid is 12 x 12 = 144 square feet. Dividing the total area by the area of one square (i.e., 144 / 144 = 1), we get the total number of squares in the grid, which is 144.

Finally, multiplying the number of goblins that can fit in each square by the total number of squares in the grid, we get the total number of goblins that can be placed in the entire grid: 0.14 goblins per square x 144 squares = 19.56 goblins (round it off to 20 goblins).

So, to answer your question, there are 20 goblins that can be placed in the entire grid."
"Response:  We have to find out how many students can get the meal allowance of Rs. 408 each if there are 408 students in total and we want to distribute it equally among them. So, the number of meals that one student will get is:

Number of meals = Total amount of meal allowance / Number of students
= Rs. 408 / 408
= 1

So, each student will get only one meal. Now, let's assume that 42 students want to avail the meal allowance. Out of these 42 students, 36 students have already availed the meal allowance, leaving 6 students who haven't availed it yet. Therefore, the number of meals that each of the remaining 6 students will get is:

Number of meals = Total amount of meal allowance / Number of students left
= Rs. 408 / 6
= 67

So, each of the remaining 6 students will get 67 meals."
"Response:  We have to find out how many students can eat at most in each of the two dining halls.  For this, we need to divide the total number of students (479) by the capacity of each dining hall (100). So, for Hall A, the maximum number of students who can eat there is:

479 / 100 = 4.79

Similarly, for Hall B, the maximum number of students who can eat there is:

479 / 100 = 4.79

Now, let's assume that some students may not want to eat in either of the two dining halls due to various reasons like personal preferences or dietary restrictions. So, let's assume that 5% of the total number of students do not eat in the dining halls.

5% of 479 = 23.95

So, the total number of students who can eat in the two dining halls is:

4.79 + 23.95 = 28.74

Therefore, the answer is 28.74."
Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in total and then calculate the percentage of students who prefer vegetarian food.  So, firstly we need to find out the total number of students.  According to the question, there are 310 students in the school.  Now, let's assume that all the students are males (which is not true).  If there were 185 male students, then the remaining 125 students would be females.  But according to the question, all the students prefer non-vegetarian food, which means that none of them prefer vegetarian food.  Therefore, the percentage of students who prefer vegetarian food is zero percent (0%).
Response:  We have to find out how many students will take lunch and how many will not take lunch based on their preference.  So, we can write two equations:  For those who want to take lunch: 288 - 105 = 183  For those who don't want to take lunch: 264 - 105 = 159 Now, let's find out how many students will take lunch: 183 / 264 = 0.70 (approximately) So, around 70 students will take lunch.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can give suggestions for each dish and then calculate the total number of suggestions required.  For this, we need to know the number of dishes being served.  From the question, we know that there are 457 students in total and they all want to give suggestions for different dishes. So, the total number of dishes being served is 457. Now, let's assume that each student wants to suggest only one dish. In that case, none of the students will be able to give more than one suggestion, as the question states that each student can give only one suggestion. Therefore, the total number of suggestions required from all the students is 457 (the number of dishes being served). If some students want to suggest more than one dish, then the calculation would be slightly different. But since the question does not provide any information about it, we cannot make any assumptions or calculations based on that.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can get the opportunity to eat lunch if 182 students are already eating and there are 30 more students who want to eat lunch.  If we divide 182 by 30, we get 6 (round off to nearest integer). So, 6 students will get the opportunity to eat lunch.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can be accommodated in each of the three categories - vegetarian, non-vegetarian and vegan.  For this, we need to divide the total number of students (324) among these categories.  Vegetarian category: Since there are 374 male students, if we want to accommodate all of them in the vegetarian category, we will have to provide 374 x 2 = 748 meals per day.  Non-vegetarian category: As there are 128 female students, if we want to accommodate all of them in the non-vegetarian category, we will have to provide 128 x 2 = 256 meals per day.  Vegan category: Since there are 324 students in total, if we want to accommodate all of them in the vegan category, we will have to provide 324 x 1 = 324 meals per day. Therefore, the final answer is: Vegetarian - 748 meals/day Non-vegetarian - 256 meals/day Vegan - 324 meals/day
Response:  If there are 257 students in total and each student has to give suggestions for 3 dishes, then the total number of suggestions will be 257 x 3 = 761. Now, if 120 students have given their suggestions directly, then the remaining 137 students (i.e., 257 - 120) have not given any suggestion. Therefore, out of these 137 students, 97 students have given suggestions indirectly through their friends or relatives, which means that they have influenced the decision-making process indirectly. So, the final answer is 761 + 97 = 858.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can eat at most one meal per day and how many students can eat more than one meal per day.  From the given data, we know that there are 144 students in total, and they need to be divided into three groups - those who can eat at most one meal per day, those who can eat more than one meal per day, and those who cannot eat any meals per day.  For the first group (those who can eat at most one meal per day), we have 467 menus available, which means each student in this group can eat at most one meal per day. Therefore, the number of students in this group is 467/1 = 467.  For the second group (those who can eat more than one meal per day), we have 79 tomatoes available, which means each student in this group can eat more than one meal per day. Therefore, the number of students in this group is 79/1 = 79.  For the third group (those who cannot eat any meals per day), we have no information provided in the question, so let's assume there are zero students in this group. Therefore, the total number of students is 467 + 79 + 0 = 546.
Response:  We have to find out how many students can eat in each of the three dishes ( Aloo Gobi, Tamarind Rice and Tomato Rice) based on their preferences.  For this, we need to divide the total number of students (228) among these three dishes according to their preference.  Since 104 students prefer Aloo Gobi, 65 students prefer Tamarind Rice, and 59 students prefer Tomato Rice, we can allocate them accordingly:  Aloo Gobi - 104 students x 2 = 208 servings Tamarind Rice - 65 students x 2 = 130 servings Tomato Rice - 59 students x 2 = 118 servings Now, let's see how many students can eat in each serving:  Aloo Gobi - 208 servings / 337 students = 0.61 servings per student Tamarind Rice - 130 servings / 337 students = 0.38 servings per student Tomato Rice - 118 servings / 337 students = 0.35 servings per student Based on this calculation, we can conclude that:  * 208 students can eat in one serving of Aloo Gobi.  * 130 students can eat in one serving of Tamarind Rice.  * 118 students can eat in one serving of Tomato Rice.
Response:  We have to distribute 66 options among 450 students in such a way that each student gets at least one option and no more than three options.  Since there are 38 options left after distributing 17 options to 17 students, we can give 2 options to 19 students, leaving 2 options for 3 students. Therefore, the number of options each student will get is: Number of options = Total number of options / Total number of students x Number of students who will get at most 3 options So, the number of options each student will get is: 66 / (450 + 3) x 38 = 38 options Each student will get 38 options.
"Response:  We have to find out how many students can give suggestions for each dish and how many dishes they want to suggest.  From the given information, we know that there are 218 students in total, and among them, 351 students want to give suggestions for dishes. So, the number of students who can give suggestions for each dish is:

Number of students giving suggestions = Total number of students / Number of students wanting to give suggestions
= 218 / 351
= 0.67 (or approximately 3/5)

Now, let's find out how many dishes each student wants to suggest. Since there are 351 students who want to give suggestions, and each student can suggest at most 4 dishes, the total number of dishes suggested by all the students is:

Total number of dishes suggested = Number of students x Maximum number of dishes each student can suggest
= 351 x 4
= 1404

So, the answer to the question is:

Out of 218 students, 67 students can give suggestions for each dish, and they will suggest a maximum of 4 dishes each, resulting in a total of 1404 dishes being suggested."
Response:  We have to find out how many students can get lunch if we give 269 students breakfast and 330 students dinner. So, total number of students who will be given food = 269 + 330 = 599. Now, we need to divide this number with the number of meals (lunch) available, which is 76. Therefore, the number of meals each student will get = Total number of students / Number of meals = 599 / 76 = 8.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many pairs of students can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students (569 + 236) by 2. So, the number of pairs of students is: 569 + 236 = 780 / 2 = 390 pairs. Since each pair consists of one boy and one girl, the number of boys in each pair is equal to the number of girls in each pair, which is 190. Therefore, the number of boys who have a base of a girl is also 190.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in the school and 841 boys. So, the number of boys who have at least one girl as their neighbor is given by: Number of boys with at least one girl as their neighbor = Total number of boys - Number of boys who have no girls as their neighbors (i.e., those who only have boys as their neighbors) Total number of boys = 841 Since there are 34 girls in the school, the number of boys who have no girls as their neighbors is equal to the total number of boys minus the number of boys who have exactly one girl as their neighbor. Therefore, we can write: Number of boys with no girls as their neighbor = Total number of boys - Number of boys who have exactly one girl as their neighbor Number of boys with no girls as their neighbor = 841 - 34 = 797 Now, let's find out how many boys have exactly one girl as their neighbor. To do this, we need to subtract the number of boys who have more than one girl as their neighbor from the total number of boys. Therefore, we can write: Number of boys with exactly one girl as their neighbor = Total number of boys - Number of boys who have more than one girl as their neighbor Number of boys with exactly one girl as their neighbor = 841 - 206 = 635 Finally, we can find out the boy whose Basanti does not live near him by counting the number of boys who do not have any girl as their neighbor. There are 797 boys who do not have any girl as their neighbor, so the boy whose Basanti does not live near him is among them. Therefore, the answer is 797.
Response:  We have 485 students in total and 232 are girls. So, the number of boys is 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in the school.
Response:  We have 697 girls in the school and we need to find out how many boys are left after 228 of them got married. So, the number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls who got married. = 697 - 228 = 469 boys. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 635 girls in the school and 510 boys, then the total number of students in the school is: 635 + 510 = 1145 Now, if 400 boys leave the school, the remaining number of boys will be: 510 - 400 = 110 So, the number of boys left in the school is 110.
Response:  We have 868 students in total and 281 of them are boys. So, the number of girls is 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, there are 587 girls in the school.
"Response:  We have 700 girls and 142 boys in the school. If we distribute them equally among all the classes, then each class will have:

Number of girls = Total number of girls / Number of classes = 700 / 5 = 140

So, there are 140 girls in each class. Now, let's find out how many boys are left after distributing them equally among all the classes:

Number of boys = Total number of boys / Number of classes = 142 / 5 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 boys left in the school after distributing them equally among all the classes."
Response:  We have 706 girls and 222 boys in school initially. If 418 girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be: 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Now, we need to find out how many boys are left in the school after 418 girls join. So, the number of boys left is: 222 - (418 / 2) = 222 - 209 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 boys in the school now.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. If 44 of them join the club, then the number of girls in the club will be 902 - 44 = 858. So, there will be 858 girls in the club.
Response:  We have 632 girls and 410 boys in school initially. If 465 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be: 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Now, we need to find out how many boys are left after adding these new girls. So, the total number of boys is: 410 - (Number of girls added) = 410 - 465 = 255 boys. Therefore, there are 255 boys in the school who are not part of the group that joined later.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. If 682 girls join the club, then we have:  Total number of girls = 732 - 682 = 50 Girls who did not join the club = 761 - (682 + 50) = 91 Boys who did not join the club = 761 - (682 + 50 + 91) = 40 So, there are 40 boys who did not join the club.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school. If all of them attend school together, then the total number of students in the school is 135 + 214 = 349. Now, if 496 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls in the school becomes 135 + 496 = 631. Similarly, if 910 more boys join the school, then the total number of boys in the school becomes 214 + 910 = 1124. So, there are 1124 boys in the school who do not attend classes with the existing 135 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. If we assume that each teacher teaches an equal number of students (boys and girls), then the total number of students a teacher can have is: Total Number of Students = Number of Boys x Number of Girls = 318 x 308 = 9544 Now, since there are 36 teachers in the school, the maximum number of students each teacher can have is: Maximum Number of Students per Teacher = Total Number of Students / Number of Teachers = 9544 / 36 = 274 Therefore, there must be at least 274 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school.  If we assume that each teacher has to teach at least one class of students (which is not always true), then we can calculate the minimum number of classes required for each gender as follows: For Girls: Number of girls = 315 Minimum number of classes required per girl = 772 / 315 = 2.46 classes per girl For Boys: Number of boys = 309 Minimum number of classes required per boy = 772 / 309 = 2.58 classes per boy Since both numbers are greater than 1, we can conclude that there are more than 2 classes for each gender in the school. Therefore, there must be at least 3 classes for each gender in the school. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have 402 girls and 739 boys in total. If we want to find out how many boys are there in the school, we can divide the number of boys by the total number of students. So, 739 / 1141 = 0.65 or approximately 65 boys. Therefore, there are 65 boys in the school.
Response:  We have to find out how many students are in the school and then divide it by the number of boys. So, we can start with finding out the total number of students in the school. According to the question, there are 458 girls in the school. If there were 692 boys, the total number of students would be 458 + 692 = 1140. Now, let's divide the total number of students by the number of boys: 1140 / 692 = 1.73 Therefore, there are approximately 1.73 times more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We have 362 boys and 257 girls in school. If we add 403 more girls to the school, then the total number of girls will be 403 + 257 = 660. So, there are 660 - 362 = 308 girls in the school now. Therefore, there are 308 girls for every 362 boys in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the advertisement which is given as $1600. Now, we have to find out how many days the ad will run for. According to the question, the ad will run for 18 days. So, the daily cost of the ad is calculated as follows: Total Cost / Number of Days = $1600 / 18 = $88 per day. Therefore, the answer is $88.
Response:  Advertisement cost is $13 dollars per hour. If he works for 3 hours, then his total advertisement cost will be $39 (13 x 3). Now, if he gets paid $20 for each hour of work, then his total earnings from working for those three hours will be $60 ($20 x 3). So, the amount left after paying for advertisement is $41 ($60 - $39).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Edward has spent so far. According to the question, he has spent $9000 and has $1700 left. So, the total amount he has spent is $9000 - $1700 = $7300. Now, let's find out how much money he will have after buying the new laptop. As per the question, he will get $800 off on the new laptop, which means he will pay $8000 - $800 = $7200. Therefore, after buying the new laptop, Edward will have $7200 - $7300 = -$100 left.
"Response:  We know that there are 92 books in total and each book costs $16. So, the total cost of all the books is:

$16 x 92 = $1472

Now, we need to find out how much money Edward has left after buying all the books. We know that he had $80 initially, so let's subtract the total cost of the books from his initial amount:

$80 - $1472 = $-1392

So, Edward has $1392 left after buying all the books."
Response:  We have to find out how many dollars each book costs and then add them up to get the total cost of all six books.  So, let's start with the first book: $20 x 6 = $120 The second book costs half of the first one, so it costs $120 / 2 = $60 The third book costs twice as much as the second book, so it costs $60 x 2 = $120 The fourth book costs $50 more than the third book, so it costs $120 + $50 = $170 The fifth book costs $30 less than the fourth book, so it costs $170 - $30 = $140 The sixth book costs $20 less than the fifth book, so it costs $140 - $20 = $120 Therefore, the total cost of all six books is $120 + $60 + $120 + $170 + $140 + $120 = $890
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Edward has spent so far. According to the question, he has spent $60 on books and $16 on stationery. Therefore, his total spending till now is $76 ($60 + $16). Now, let's find out how much money Edward has left after buying the notebook. As per the question, he bought a notebook worth $18. So, he has spent $76 - $18 = $58 on the notebook. Hence, Edward has $58 left after buying the notebook.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the cost of each book in dollars. As per the given information, one book costs $40 and three books cost $3 x $3 = $90. Therefore, the total cost of all four books is $40 + $90 = $130. So, the cost of each book is $130 / 4 = $32.50.
Response:  We know that Edvard spent $16 on books and then he got $8 back as change. So, the amount of money left with him after buying the book is $16 - $8 = $8.
Response:  Advertisement cost is $17 per hour and his friend has given him $10 for betting. He won $7 from the game. So, he has earned $7 - $10 = $3 more than what he spent on advertising. Therefore, the net profit is $3.
Response:  James scored 44 push-ups today and David did 58 beer push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups David did than James, we need to subtract their scores. So, the difference between their scores is: 44 - 58 = -14. Therefore, David did 14 more push-ups than James.
"Response:  We have two quantities to be compared: Jackie's push-ups (51) and David's push-ups (44). To compare them, we need to convert both numbers into a common unit of measurement, such as meters or kilometers for distance, or weight in kilograms for mass. Since push-ups are not measured in units of distance or weight, let's assume that they are equivalent to a standardized unit of effort, such as ""push-up units"" (PUU). Then, we can calculate the number of PUUs required for each person as follows: Jackie did 51 push-ups, which is equal to 51 / 3 = 17 PUUs per minute. David did 44 push-ups, which is equal to 44 / 3 = 14 PUUs per minute. Now, to find out who did more push-ups overall, we simply add up the total number of PUUs performed by each person: Jackie did 17 x 60 = 1020 PUUs over 60 minutes, while David did 14 x 60 = 840 PUUs over 60 minutes. Therefore, based on this comparison, Jackie performed more push-ups than David."
Response:  We know that David has 44 push-ups in total and he wants to do 50 more. So, he needs 6 push-ups more. Now, we are given that Jack can do 9 more push-ups than David. Therefore, Jack can do 50 - 9 = 41 push-ups more than David.
Response:  David has 51 push-ups to do and he did 49 in total. So, he still needs to do 2 more push-ups.
Response:  Jamie scored 59 push-ups and 44 crunches today. David did 19 tuck jumps in 27 seconds. So, David did more push-ups than Jamie but fewer crunches. Therefore, David is better at push-ups than Jamie.
Response:  David has made 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. If he continues to do so at the same rate, in how many minutes will he complete 30 push-ups and 20 crunches? We know that David does one push-up every 3 seconds and one crunch every 5 seconds. So, if he completes 44 push-ups in 39 minutes (since there are 60 seconds in a minute), then he will take 39 x 3 = 117 minutes to complete 30 push-ups. Similarly, if he takes 17 minutes to complete 17 crunches, then he will take 17 x 5 = 85 minutes to complete 20 crunches. Therefore, David will require 117 + 85 = 202 minutes to complete 30 push-ups and 20 crunches.
Response:  Jamie scored 53 push-ups and 14 crunches today. David did 17 tuck jumps in 10 seconds. Jackie did 20 push-ups and 8 crunches. So, Jamie did 53/2 = 26.5 push-ups per minute, and David did 17 x 60 = 1020 jumping jacks per minute. Now, let's calculate how many push-ups or crunches Jackie did per minute: Jackie did 20 push-ups in 1 minute, so she did 20 / 60 = 0.33 push-ups per second. She also did 8 crunches in 1 minute, so she did 8 / 60 = 0.13 crunches per second.
Response:  David has made 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. To calculate how many meters he ran, we need to know that one meter is equal to 100 push-ups. So, if David did 35 push-ups, then he ran 35 x 100 = 3500 meters. Therefore, David ran 870 meters less than 3500 meters.
Response:  Jamie scored 46 push-ups and 58 crunches today. David did 38 tuck jumps in 62 seconds. Jackie completed 10 squats in 20 seconds. So, we need to find out how many crunches Jackie did relative to Jamie's score. We know that Jackie took 62 seconds to do 10 squats, which means she did one squat every 6.2 seconds (since there are 10 squats). Now, let's convert this time into minutes: 60 seconds / 60 = 1 minute. Therefore, Jackie did 10 squats in 1 minute. Since Jamie scored 58 crunches, we can say that Jackie did half of Jamie's number of crunches, i.e., 58/2 = 29 crunches.
Response:  David has 19 push-ups and Jack has 39 more than him. So, Jack has 58 push-ups (39 + 19). Now, John does 13 less than Jack. Therefore, John has 45 push-ups (58 - 13).
Response:  Jamie scored 51 push-ups today. David did 22 more than Jamie, so he scored 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Jack also did 40 more than David, so he scored 113 push-ups (73 + 40 = 113). Therefore, John scored 113 push-ups.
Response:  Jamie scored 15 push-ups today and David did 39 more than him. Jackie did 9 less than John. So, if John did 30 push-ups, then Jamie did 15 + 9 = 24 push-ups.
"Response:  David has 37 tonnes of push-ups to do in total. If he does 30 tonnes per day, how many days will it take him to complete all 37 tonnes?

Answer:  To find out how many days it will take David to complete his target of 37 tonnes of push-ups, we can divide the total amount by the daily amount he is doing:

37 tonnes / 30 tonnes per day = 12.33 days
So, it will take David approximately 12.33 days to complete his entire target of 37 tonnes of push-ups if he continues at the same rate of 30 tonnes per day."
Response:  David has 56 tons of basmati rice to sell. If he sells each ton at Rs.38 per kilogram, how much money will he make in total? So, David will make Rs.2072 (56 x 38) in total.
"Response:  We know that David has 40 tonnes of push-ups and he wants to sell them at Rs. 17 per kilogram. So, if we calculate the total amount of money he will get from selling all his push-ups, it would be:

Total amount = Number of push-ups x Selling price per kg
= 40 tonnes x Rs. 17 per kg
= Rs. 680 (approximately)
Now, let's see how much Jackie can buy with Rs. 340. If Jackie pays Rs. 340 for 25 tonnes of push-ups, then the cost per kilogram is:

Cost per kg = Total amount / Amount paid by Jackie
= Rs. 680 / Rs. 340
= Rs. 2.0 (approximately)
So, David can sell 25 tonnes of push-ups to Jackie for approximately Rs. 2.0 per kilogram."
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 36 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 36, 27, 18, 9, 58, 33, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1.  Since there are 12 numbers in the sequence, we can divide each number by 12 to get an average value for the entire sequence:  (36 / 12) = 3, (27 / 12) = 2, (18 / 12) = 1.5, (9 / 12) = 0.75, (58 / 12) = 4.5, (33 / 12) = 2.75, (20 / 12) = 1.67, (10 / 12) = 0.83, (5 / 12) = 0.42, (3 / 12) = 0.25, and (2 / 12) = 0.17.  Therefore, the average value of the given sequence is approximately 2.5.
Response:  David has 27 tonnes of push-ups and wants to know how many crunches he can do in 7 minutes. To calculate this, we need to convert the weight from tonnes to kilograms. There are 1000 kg in 1 tonne, so David has 27,000 kg of push-ups (27 x 1000). Now, let's assume that each crunch takes 1 second, which means David can do 7 x 60 = 420 crunches in 7 minutes (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute). Therefore, David can do approximately 27,000 / 420 = 63 crunches per minute.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of math homework are there in total and then divide it by 2 to get the number of pages that Omi has done.  So, let's calculate the total number of pages of math homework as follows:  Total number of pages = 5 + 2 = 7 pages.  Now, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of pages that Omi has done: Number of pages done by Omi = 7 pages / 2 = 3.5 pages. Since we can't have half a page, we round off the result to the nearest whole number, which is 4 pages. Therefore, Omi has done 4 pages of math homework.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are there in each of the three books and then add them up.  Book 1 has 30 pages, Book 2 has 40 pages, and Book 3 has 50 pages. So, the total number of pages is: 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 pages. Therefore, there are 120 pages in all three books combined.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages of homework are there in total and then divide it by 5 to get the number of pages per student. So, let's calculate the total number of pages of homework first. According to the question, there are 7 homeworks in total. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework is: 7 x 5 = 35 pages. Now, we need to divide the total number of pages of homework by 5 to get the number of pages per student. So, the number of pages per student is: 35 / 5 = 7 pages.
Response:  If O has completed 7 pages of his/her homework and wants to know how many more pages he/she needs to complete to finish all 16 pages, then we can use the following calculation: Number of remaining pages = Total number of pages - Completed pages = 16 - 7 = 9 pages Therefore, O needs to complete 9 more pages of his/her homework.
Response:  If Rahul has completed 8 pages of his math homework and he wants to complete 3 more pages, then he will have completed a total of 11 pages (8 + 3 = 11). So, out of the remaining 5 pages, he can complete 2 pages (5 - 2 = 3) leaving him with 3 pages left to complete.
Response:  If Rahul has completed 8 pages of his homework and he had to complete 6 pages in total, then he still needs to complete 2 more pages (8 - 6 = 2). So, out of the remaining 4 pages, if he completes 1 page every day, then it will take him 4 days to complete all 4 pages (4/1 = 4 days). Therefore, Rahul will be able to complete his entire homework in 4 + 2 = 6 days.
Response:  If O has completed 10 pages of his/her math homework and wants to know how many pages he/she needs to complete to finish all 30 pages, then we can calculate it as follows: Total number of pages = Number of pages completed / Number of pages left to complete = 10 / 20 = 0.5 or  half So, O needs to complete 15 more pages (30 - 10 = 20) to finish all 30 pages of his/her math homework.
Response:  We have to make 2 x 3 = 6 pages of math worksheets and 10 pages of science worksheets. So in total we need to make 6 + 10 = 16 pages of worksheets.

Response:  We have to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and 7 pages of biology homework in total. Out of these, we have completed 3 pages of mathematics homework and 2 pages of biology homework so far. Therefore, there are remaining 5 pages of mathematics homework and 5 pages of biology homework left to be completed.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are there in each subject and then add them up.  Here is what we know from the question:  * There are 5 subjects in total.  * Each subject has 10 pages.  * The homework book contains 6 pages of biology.  * The homework book contains 4 pages of mathematics.  So, let's calculate the number of pages for each subject:  Biology: 6 pages x 5 subjects = 30 pages Mathematics: 4 pages x 5 subjects = 20 pages Now, let's add up the total number of pages: Total pages = 30 + 20 = 50 pages Therefore, there are 50 pages in the homework book.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are there in each subject and then add them up.  For math, we have 4 pages, so the total number of pages is 4.  For science, we have 3 pages, so the total number of pages is 7 (4 + 3). Therefore, the total number of pages in all subjects is 7 + 4 = 11 pages.
Response:  We have to find out how many pages are there in each subject book and then add them up.  For mathematics, we have 7 pages (pages 1-7).  For science, we have 8 pages (pages 1-8).  So, the total number of pages is 7 + 8 = 15 pages.
Response:  We know that Jack has Rs 60 in his pocket and he wants to buy something worth Rs 20 from an email shop. So, he will have Rs 40 left after buying something from the email shop. Now, we are asked how much money Jack will have if he spends Rs 15 more than what he already has. Therefore, the answer is Rs 40 + (Rs 15) = Rs 55.
Response:  We know that Jack has Rs 6 in his pocket and he wants to buy something worth Rs 8 from an email shop. So, we need to find out how many emails can be bought with Rs 6. Now, let's assume that each email costs Rs 1. Therefore, we can calculate the number of emails as follows: Number of emails = Total amount of money available for buying emails / Cost of each email = Rs 6 / Re 1 = 6 emails Now, since Jack wants to buy something worth Rs 8 from the email shop, we can conclude that he will have Rs 2 left after buying the emails (Rs 8 - Rs 6 = Rs 2).
Response:  Jack sends an email to Charli at 2 pm every day. He wants to send her 5 emails in total today. So, he will send 1/5 of his daily emails at 2 pm = 0.4 emails per hour ( rounded off to nearest whole number). Therefore, Jack will be able to send all 5 emails to Charli by 5 pm today.
Response:  Jack can send 6 emails in an hour, and he sends 3 emails in the evening. So, in one day, Jack can send 6 x 24 = 144 emails.
Response:  Jack has 5 emails in his inbox at noon and he sends out 8 mails in the evening. So, the number of emails in his inbox after sending those 8 mails is: 5 - 8 = -3. Therefore, Jack has -3 emails in his inbox after sending those 8 mails.
Response:  Jack wants to send an email at 5 pm and he wants to receive it at 6 pm. So, there is a time difference of 1 hour between when Jack sends the email and when he receives it. Therefore, if Jack sends the email at 5 pm, he will receive it at 6 pm + 1 hour = 7 pm.
Response:  Jack has three emails in his inbox at noon and four messages in his chat box at 3 pm. So, there are 7 (three + four) emails or messages in total that Jack has received during this time period.
"Response:  We know that Jack has sent 10 emails in the morning and received 7 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails exchanged between them is:

10 (morning) + 7 (evening) = 17

Therefore, there are 17 emails exchanged between Jack and his friend."
"Response:  We know that Jack can walk 9 miles in the morning and 7 miles in the evening. So, if he walks for 3 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening, his total distance walked will be:

Morning distance = 9 x 3 = 27 miles
Evening distance = 7 x 2 = 14 miles
Total distance = Morning distance + Evening distance = 27 + 14 = 41 miles
Therefore, Jack can cover 41 miles in one day."
Response:  Jack has 10 emails in his inbox at noon and sends out 5 emails in the evening. So, he has sent a total of 15 emails (10 + 5). Now, we need to find out how many emails he will have in his inbox after sending those 15 emails. We know that for every email he sends, he gets back 4 emails. So, if he sends 15 emails, he will get 60 emails (15 x 4) in his inbox after sending them. Therefore, Jack will have 75 emails (60 - 10) in his inbox after sending those 15 emails.
Response:  Jack sends an email at 2 pm with a weight of 6 emails. In the evening, he receives 3 more emails, making it a total of 9 emails. So, in one day, Jack received a total of 10 emails (including both sent and received).
Response:  Jack can send 3 emails in 1 minute and 64 emails in 1 hour. So, he can send 3 x 60 = 180 emails in 24 hours. Now, let's calculate how many emails Jack can send in one day. There are 24 hours in a day, so Jack can send 180 emails / 24 hours = 7.5 emails per hour. Therefore, Jack can send approximately 7.5 emails per hour.
Response:  We know that Jack can send 5 emails and receive 6 emails per day. So, in one week (i.e., 7 days), he can send 5 x 7 = 35 emails and receive 6 x 7 = 42 emails. Now, we need to calculate how many emails Jack will have after 9 days (i.e., 9 x 7 = 63). Since Jack sends 35 emails in one week and receives 42 emails in one week, he will have 35 - 42 = -7 emails left after 9 days. Therefore, Jack will not have any emails left after 9 days.
Response:  We know that Jack has received 10 emails and sent 12 letters. Now, we need to find out how many times he has written an email or letter in total. To do this, we multiply the number of emails he received (10) by the number of letters he wrote (12), which gives us 120. Then, we subtract the number of emails he sent (3) from the total number of emails he wrote (120), which gives us 117. Finally, we divide the number of letters he wrote (44) by the number of emails he sent (3), which gives us 15. So, Jack has written 15 emails in total.
Response:  We know that Jack has received 6 emails and wants to send 8 letters in response. So, he needs to send 2 more letters than the number of emails he received. Therefore, the total number of letters Jack will send is: 6 + 2 = 8.
Response:  Jack sent 6 emails in total and received 91 emails in return. So, he received an average of 15.17 emails per day (91/6).
Response:  Jack has received 6 emails in total and he spends 8 minutes reading each email. So, the time taken by Jack to read all the 6 emails is: Time = Number of emails x Time per email = 6 x 8 = 48 minutes.
"Response: 
Jack received 9 emails in one day and he replied to all of them. Now, let's calculate how many emails Jack sent during that day.
Total number of emails = Number of emails received + Number of emails sent
= 9 + (Number of emails replied)
So, Jack sent 7 emails during that day as he replied to 7 out of 9 total emails received."
Response:  Jack has three emails in his inbox and five spam emails in his spam folder. He wants to transfer three emails from his inbox to his spam folder. So, he will have three emails in his spam folder after transferring them from his inbox. Now, let's calculate the number of emails that Jack has in his spam folder before transferring any emails. There are 20 emails in his spam folder initially. After transferring three emails from his inbox, the total number of emails in his spam folder will be 20 + 3 = 23 emails. Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  We know that Jack can send three emails in one minute and there are six hours in a day. So, he can send 3 x 6 = 18 emails per day. Now, we need to calculate how many emails he can send in total in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so Jack can send 18 x 30 = 540 emails in a month.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the tiddler (9 inches) is greater than the height of the Frappuccino cup (12 inches). So, we divide the height of the Frappuccino cup by the length of the tiddler: $$ \frac{12}{9} = 1.33 $$ Therefore, there are $ 1 + 33 = 34 $ times that the length of the tiddler is greater than the height of the Frappuccino cup.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the smaller rectangle (31 inches) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two rectangles (35 + 28 = 63 inches). So, we can say that the ratio of the longer rectangle to the shorter one is 63 : 31 or 2 : 1. Now, let's convert this ratio into a decimal value. Since 2 / 1 = 2, so the decimal equivalent of this ratio is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many inches Tiddly is from Muffin.  Tiddly is 20 inches tall and Muffin is 17 inches tall, so Tiddly is 3 inches taller than Muffin. Now we need to find out how far Tiddly is from Muffin. Since Tiddly is 3 inches taller than Muffin, for every inch that Tiddly is tall, Muffin is 1/3 of an inch away. Therefore, if Tiddly is x inches tall, Muffin is (x / 3) inches away. So, the distance between Tiddly and Muffin is x - (x / 3). Simplifying this expression, we get x = 15 inches. Therefore, Tiddly is 15 inches away from Muffin.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the tape (25 inches) is greater than the distance between two points (18 inches). So, we divide the length of the tape by the distance between two points:  $ \frac{25}{18} = 3$  Therefore, there are three times the length of the tape between the two points.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the tape (19 inches) is greater than the distance between two points (10 inches). So, we divide 19 by 10 and get 1.9. Now, we need to find out how many times the length of the tape (20 inches) is less than the distance between two points (10 inches). So, we divide 20 by 10 and get 2. Therefore, there are 2 times when the length of the tape is less than the distance between two points.
Response:  We have to find out how much distance there is between the two points (0, 19) and (39, 94). To do this, we can use the formula for distance = square root of (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2. In this case, x1 = 0, x2 = 39, y1 = 19, and y2 = 94. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: Distance = sqrt(39^2 - 0^2 + 94^2 - 19^2) Distance = sqrt(1161 + 4025 + 8072 - 3675) Distance = sqrt(14688) Distance = 123.06 meters So, the distance between the two points (0, 19) and (39, 94) is approximately 123.06 meters.
Response:  We have to find out how much longer is the tail of the second mouse from its head than the first mouse.  The length of the tail of the first mouse is 32 inches and that of the second mouse is 26 inches less than its head. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Head-tail length of first mouse = 32 inches Tail-head length of second mouse = 26 inches - (length of head of second mouse) Now, we need to find the length of the head of the second mouse. According to the question, the height of the second mouse is 25 inches less than the height of the first mouse. So, we can write another equation as follows: Height of second mouse = Height of first mouse - 25 inches Substituting the value of 25 inches in the first equation, we get: Head-tail length of first mouse = 32 inches Tail-head length of second mouse = 26 inches - (Height of first mouse - 25 inches) Simplifying and solving for the length of the tail of the second mouse, we get: Length of tail of second mouse = 9 inches Therefore, the tail of the second mouse is 9 inches longer than the head of the second mouse.
Response:  We have to find out how many inches Chuha (dog) is from Tiddi (cat).  Tiddi is 24 inches long and has a tail of 33 inches. So, the total length of Tiddi including its tail is 57 inches. Now, we need to find out how much distance there is between Tiddi and Chuha. According to the question, Chuha is 5 inches shorter than Tiddi. Therefore, the distance between them is 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the grasshopper can jump in one second.  Firstly, we know that the grasshopper can jump 13 inches in one leap.  Now, let's calculate the time taken for the grasshopper to cover this distance.  The distance is 13 inches, and the speed of the grasshopper is 0.5 feet/second (as given in the question). So, the time taken to cover this distance is: Time = Distance / Speed = 13 inches / 0.5 feet/second = 26 seconds. Therefore, the grasshopper can jump 26 times in one second.
Response:  We have to find out how many inches are there between two consecutive lines of text in the given passage.  To do this, we need to count the number of inches between each line and divide it by the total number of lines.  Based on the given passage, we can see that there are 20 lines of text. So, let's count the number of inches between each line:  Line 1 to Line 2 = 4 inches Line 2 to Line 3 = 5 inches Line 3 to Line 4 = 6 inches Line 4 to Line 5 = 7 inches... (and so on) Therefore, the total distance between each line is: 4 + 5 + 6 +... = 20 inches Now, dividing the total distance by the total number of lines gives us the average distance between each line: 20 inches / 20 lines = 1 inch per line So, the answer to the question is 1 inch.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the grasshopper (19 inches) is greater than the length of the mouse (4 inches). So, we divide 19 by 4 and get 4.75. Since we can't have a fraction of an inch, round it off to the nearest whole number which is 5. Therefore, the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse is 5 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how many inches are between two points - 39 inches and 19 inches. So, we subtract 19 from 39: 39 - 19 = 20 inches. Now, we need to find out how far is the mouse from the base of the grasshopper. The question states that the mouse is 12 inches away from the base of the grasshopper. Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the base of the grasshopper is 12 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of Tiddlywink (21 inches) is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other three objects (Mousetrap, Meatball, and Bread).  The total length of these four objects is given as 85 inches. So, we can calculate it as follows:  Length of Tiddlywink = 21 inches  Length of Mousetrap = 30 inches  Length of Meatball = 25 inches  Length of Bread = 16 inches  Total length of all four objects = 85 inches Now, let's check which one is shorter than or equal to Tiddlywink:  Tiddlywink < 85 inches (since its length is only 21 inches)  Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Gajanan is 39 inches tall and Tiddee is 17 inches tall. Now, we need to find out how far Tiddee is from Gajanan. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Start Position - End Position In this case, the speed of Tiddee is unknown, so we cannot calculate the distance directly. However, we can use an indirect method to solve the problem. Since Gajanan is standing still, his start position is (0, 0). Tiddee starts at a height of 17 inches above the ground, which means he is at a distance of 17 inches from Gajanan. As Tiddee moves away from Gajanan, his distance from him increases linearly with time. So, after some time, Tiddee will be at a distance of x inches from Gajanan. Therefore, the equation for the distance between Tiddee and Gajanan at any given time t is: d(t) = 17 + (x/t) Where 'd(t)' represents the distance between Tiddee and Gajanan at time t, and 'x' is the total distance traveled by Tiddee in that time. Now, we are asked to find out how far Tiddee is from Gajanan after 39 seconds have passed. Using the equation above, we can see that after 39 seconds, Tiddee has traveled a distance of: x = 39 \* (60/1) = 235 inches Therefore, the distance between Tiddee and Gajanan after 39 seconds is: d(39) = 17 + (235/39) = 40.8 inches So, the answer to the question is 40.8 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how many inches Grasshopper can jump in one leap and then calculate the distance between Mouse and Turtle.  The height of Grasshopper is given as 9 inches.  So, it can jump that much distance in one leap.  Now, we need to find the distance between Mouse and Turtle.  According to the question, the distance between them is 33 inches.  Therefore, the distance between Mouse and Turtle after Grasshopper jumps is 33 - 9 = 24 inches.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of the tape measure (in inches) is equal to or greater than the length of the pencil (in inches).  The length of the tape measure is given as 14 inches, and the length of the pencil is given as 37 inches.  So, we need to find out how many times 14 inches is equal to or greater than 37 inches.  To do this, we can divide 37 inches by 14 inches and see if the result is a whole number.  If the result is a whole number, then that many times the length of the tape measure is equal to or greater than the length of the pencil.  In this case, when we divide 37 inches by 14 inches, we get 2.57.  This means that the length of the tape measure is equal to or greater than the length of the pencil approximately 2.57 times.
Response:  We have to make 14 cups of rice and we need 6 cups of water for it. So, we will require 8 more cups of water (14 - 6 = 8). Now, if we want to cook 5 cups of atta (flour), we will require 3/4 cup of oil (5 / 4 = 3/4) since each cup of atta requires 1/4 cup of oil. Therefore, the total amount of water required is 8 + 3/4 = 10.75 cups.

Now, we have to calculate how much chili powder is needed for 7 cups of rice.  If we assume that 1 tablespoon of chili powder makes 1/4 cup of chili paste, then we need 30 tablespoons of chili powder (7 x 4 = 28).  So, the final answer is 7 cups of rice and 30 tablespoons of chili powder.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice are required to make 12 cups of biryani. Since each cup of basmati rice requires 5 cups of water, we need (12 x 5) = 60 cups of water for cooking the biryani. Now, since there are 49 cups of nuskha in 1 cup of chini, we need (60 / 49) = 1.22 cups of chini for every cup of biryani. So, if we want to make 12 cups of biryani, we will require 12 x 1.22 = 14.64 cups of chini. Therefore, the answer is 14.64 cups of chini.
Response:  We have to make 10 cups of tea using 2 cups of water and 80 grams of noonak (a type of herb). So we need 30 grams of noonak for each cup of tea. Now, let's calculate how many cups of tea we can make with 200 grams of noonak:  Number of cups = Total amount of noonak / Amount of noonak required per cup = 200 grams / 30 grams = 6.67 cups Of course, you cannot make half a cup of tea, so the maximum number of cups we can make is 6. Therefore, if we use 200 grams of noonak, we can make approximately 6 cups of tea.

Response:  We have to make 9 cups of tea using 6 cups of water and 3 teaspoons of milk powder. So we need 3 more cups of water to make 9 cups of tea. Therefore, we need 12 cups of water in total (9 + 3). Now, let's calculate how much chai masala is required for 12 cups of tea. Since each cup of tea requires 1/4 teaspoon of chai masala, we need 3 teaspoons of chai masala for 12 cups of tea. So, the final answer is 3 teaspoons of chai masala are needed to make 12 cups of tea.
Response:  We have to make 6 cups of tea using 9 cups of water and we need to add milk accordingly. So, we will require 3 cups of milk (6/9 x 100) = 33.33% more milk than water. Therefore, we will need 9 + 3 = 12 cups of milk in total. Now, if we want to know how many cups of tea we can make with 12 cups of milk, we simply divide the number of cups of milk by the number of cups of tea required per cup of milk. In this case, since each cup of tea requires 1/4 cup of milk, we can make 12 / 4 = 3 cups of tea with 12 cups of milk.
Response:  We have to make 5 cups of tea using 14 cups of water. So, we need 9 cups of water left after making 5 cups of tea. Now, let's calculate how many cups of tea we can make with 9 cups of water. Since each cup of tea requires 1/2 cup of water, we can make 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of tea. But since we cannot make half a cup of tea, we can make exactly 4 cups of tea. Therefore, the answer is 4 cups of tea.
Response:  We have to make 3 cups of tea for Mr. Kekke and Mrs. Nuskhama. Each cup requires 1 teaspoon of tea leaves. So we need 3 x 1 = 3 teaspoons of tea leaves in total. Now, there are 50 grams in 1 teaspoon, so we need 3 / 50 = 60 grams of tea leaves altogether. Since each packet contains 20 grams of tea leaves, we need 60/20 = 3 packets of tea leaves. Therefore, we will use 3 packets of tea leaves to make 3 cups of tea for Mr. Kekke and Mrs. Nuskhama.
Response:  We have to make 5 cups of tea using 13 cups of water and 8 teaspoons of tea leaves. So we need 7 more cups of water (13 - 5 = 8). Therefore, we can make 12 cups of tea in total (8 + 4 = 12).

"Response:  We have to find out how many turtles can fit in 87 tumblers of water.  Firstly, we need to calculate the volume of one tumbler of water.  A standard tumbler contains approximately 200 ml of water. Therefore, the total volume of 87 tumblers of water is:

Volume = Number of tumblers x Volume of each tumbler
= 87 x 200
= 17400 ml

Now, we need to find out how much space each turtle needs to swim comfortably. According to the question, each turtle requires about 3 times the volume of water needed for its body. So, if a turtle needs 3 times the volume of water as its body, then it means that the volume of water required for one turtle is:

Volume of water required per turtle = 3 x Body volume of turtle

We know that the average length of an adult turtle is around 20 cm (based on the information provided earlier). Therefore, the volume of a single turtle can be calculated as follows:

Body volume of turtle = Length x Width x Height
= 20 x 15 x 10
= 3000 cubic centimeters (or 3 liters)

So, the volume of water required for one turtle is:

Volume of water required per turtle = 3 x 3000
= 9000 cubic centimeters (or 9 liters)

Now, let's come back to our original problem. We want to know how many turtles can fit in 17400 ml of water. To do this, we simply divide the total volume of water by the volume of water required for each turtle:

Number of turtles that can fit in 17400 ml of water = Total volume of water / Volume of water required per turtle
= 17400 / 9000
= 0.86 or roughly 86%

Therefore, based on the calculations above, we can conclude that approximately 86% of "
"Response:  We know that there are 20 families in the village and each family has 5 members. So, the total number of people in the village is:

20 families x 5 members per family = 100 people

Now, let's consider the situation where some families have more than 5 members. For example, one family may have 7 members. In this case, we need to calculate the additional number of people in those families.

Let's assume that 3 families have more than 5 members. If each of these families has an additional 2 members (for a total of 7 members), then the total number of extra people in these families is:

3 families x 2 additional members per family = 6 extra people

So, the total number of people in the village including the extra members is:

100 people + 6 extra people = 106 people

Therefore, the answer is 106."
"Response:  We have to find out how many turtles can fit in a basket of size 85 liters and then calculate how many baskets are needed to carry all the turtles from Africa to Asia.

Let's assume that each turtle takes up approximately 1 liter of space inside the basket. Therefore, we can estimate the number of turtles that can fit in an 85-liter basket as follows:

Number of turtles = Volume of basket (in liters) / Space required per turtle (in liters)
= 85 liters / 1 liter
= 85 turtles

Now, let's calculate how many baskets are needed to carry all the turtles from Africa to Asia:

Total number of turtles = Number of turtles in Africa + Number of turtles in Asia
= 23 turtles (from Africa) + 37 turtles (from Asia)
= 50 turtles

Since we cannot divide a turtle into two parts, we need at least 50 complete baskets to transport all the turtles from Africa to Asia."
"Response:  We have to find out how many turtles can fit in a basket of size 42 cubic feet.  Firstly, we need to convert the size of the basket from cubic feet to liters. There are 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter, so:

42 cubic feet x 1000 / 35.3 = approximately 1200 liters
Now, we need to calculate the volume of a single turtle. The average length and width of an African spurred tortoise (the species mentioned in the question) is around 27-30 inches or 69-76 cm. Let's assume an average length of 30 inches or 76 cm. The height of an adult African spurred tortoise is typically around 12-18 inches or 30-46 cm. So, the volume of a single turtle can be estimated as follows:

Volume of a single turtle = Length x Width x Height = 76 cm x 30 cm x 46 cm = approximately 10,384 cubic centimeters (or 10.384 liters)
Now, let's divide the total volume of the basket (1200 liters) by the volume of a single turtle (10.384 liters):

Number of turtles that can fit in the basket = 1200 liters / 10.384 liters per turtle = approximately 115 turtles
Therefore, based on these calculations, it is possible to fit approximately 115 African spurred tortoises in a basket with a volume of 42 cubic feet."
Response:  We have to find out how many penguins can fit in a box of size 38 cm x 25 cm x 10 cm.  Since we know that each penguin takes up an area of about 0.4 m^2 (based on the given information), we can calculate the volume of one penguin as follows: Volume of one penguin = Area of one penguin x Height of one penguin = 0.4 m^2 x 0.5 m = 0.2 m^3 Now, let's calculate the total volume of all the penguins that can fit in the box: Total volume of penguins = Volume of one penguin x Number of penguins = 0.2 m^3 x 38 = 7.6 m^3 So, there can be approximately 7.6 million penguins in the box.
Response:  We have to find out how many turtles can fit in a basket of size 18 cubic feet.  The question states that there are 38 turtles in total and they all want to go to Africa.  So, we need to divide the number of turtles by the capacity of the basket to determine how many turtles can fit in it.  Therefore, the answer is:  Number of turtles that can fit in a basket = Total number of turtles / Capacity of the basket = 38 turtles / 18 cubic feet = 2.06 turtles per basket
Response:  We have to find out how many pigeons can fit in an area of 87 square meters.  To do this, we need to know the size of each pigeon and the shape of the area.  If there are 87 square meters of space available for the pigeons, then we can calculate the maximum number of pigeons that can fit in it as follows:  First, let's assume that each pigeon takes up an area of about 0.5 square meters (this is just an estimate, as pigeons come in different sizes). So, if we divide the total area of 87 square meters by the area occupied by each pigeon (0.5 square meters), we get:  Number of pigeons = Total area / Area per pigeon = 87 / 0.5 = 174 pigeons Now, since we cannot have more than 18 pigeons flying at once (as mentioned in the question), we need to subtract that number from the total number of pigeons we calculated earlier:  Number of pigeons left after removing 18 = 174 - 18 = 156 pigeons Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, we can conclude that approximately 156 pigeons can fit in an area of 87 square meters.
Response:  We have to find out how many families of birds are there in total and then calculate the number of chicks that can fit in each family based on their size.  Based on the information given in the question, we know that there are 49 bird families in the area. Each family has an average of 5 members, which means there are 49 x 5 = 245 birds in total. Now, let's assume that each family can accommodate 3-4 chicks on average. This is just an estimate as it may vary depending on the species of bird and other factors. So, we will use this rough estimate to calculate the maximum number of chicks that can fit in each family. Therefore, the total number of chicks that can fit in all the bird families is: 245 x 3 = 735 chicks. However, since not all chicks will survive, some may die due to various reasons like predators, weather conditions, etc., so the actual number of chicks that will hatch from these eggs might be lower than 735.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pigeons can fit in a valley of 27 square kilometers and then compare it with the area of another valley that has 41 square kilometers.

Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pigeon families that can be accommodated in a single square kilometer of land. As per the given information, there are approximately 30-40 pigeon pairs in each family. Therefore, the total number of pigeon families in one square kilometer = (Number of pigeon pairs/Family size) x Area of one square kilometer.

Now, let's calculate the number of pigeon families that can be accommodated in the first valley of 27 square kilometers:
 Number of pigeon families in the first valley = Total area of the first valley / Area of one square kilometer
= 27 km² / 1 km²
= 27 pigeon families

Similarly, for the second valley of 41 square kilometers, we can calculate the number of pigeon families as follows:
 Number of pigeon families in the second valley = Total area of the second valley / Area of one square kilometer
= 41 km² / 1 km²
= 41 pigeon families

Therefore, if we start counting from the beginning of the first valley, we will reach the last pigeon family at a distance of 27 km from the starting point. Similarly, if we start counting from the beginning of the second valley, we will reach the last pigeon family at a distance of 41 km from the starting point.

So, the answer to the question is: The last pigeon family in the second valley is at a distance of 41 km from the starting point."
Response:  We have to find out how many pigeons can fit in a basket of 86 taels (a tael is an old Indian unit of weight equal to about 375 grams).  If we assume that each pigeon takes up space equivalent to half a tael (i.e., 1/2 x 86 = 43 taels), then we can calculate the maximum number of pigeons that can fit in the basket as follows:  Number of pigeons that can fit in the basket = Total weight of the basket / Weight of one pigeon  Number of pigeons = 86 taels / 43 taels per pigeon = 205 pigeons  So, approximately 205 pigeons can fit in a basket of 86 taels.
Response:  We have to find out how many penguins are there in Antarctica and Africa.  In Antarctica, we have 41 penguin families, and each family has 3-5 penguins. So, the total number of penguins in Antarctica is: 41 x 3 = 123 penguins. Now, let's move to Africa. If 35 penguin families can fit in one ship, then the total number of penguins that can fit in one ship from Africa is: 35 x 62 = 2180 penguins. Therefore, the total number of penguins in both Antarctica and Africa is: 123 + 2180 = 2303 penguins.
Response:  We have to find out how many tiger families are there in the forest and how much area they cover.  From the given information, we know that there are 30 tigers in the forest and each family has 5-7 members. So, there are 30 x 5 = 150 tiger individuals in one family. Now, let's assume that each family covers an area of 10 square kilometers. Therefore, the total area covered by all the tiger families is 150 x 10 = 1500 square kilometers.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensil are required for each person in the school and then multiply it with the total number of people in the school.  So, firstly we need to calculate the number of pensils required per person.  As there are 253 students in the school, and each student needs one pencil, therefore, the total number of pensils required for all students is 253. Now, if we consider that each student has to give away one pencil, then the total number of pensils given away will be equal to the total number of students multiplied by the number of pensils required per student. Therefore, the total number of pensils given away will be 253 x 1 = 253 pensils.  Since the last day of school falls on a Saturday, so the school will remain closed on that day. Hence, no pensils will be distributed on that day. Therefore, the final answer is 253 pensils.
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year and we have to find out how many pensils will be needed for each student on their birthday. Since there are 177 students in total, we need to divide the number of pensils required per student by the number of students. So, the answer is:  Number of pensils required = 365 / 177 = 2
Response:  We have to fill 440 pens with ink and give them to our friends. Since there are 111 days left in the year, we can fill 37 pens per day (440 / 111 = 3.36). So, in total, we will fill 37 x 37 = 1359 pens. Now, let's calculate how many different colors of ink we need based on the number of pens filled. If each pen has 4 different colors of ink (red, blue, green, and black), then we will use 4 colors of ink for every 37 pens filled, which means we will use 4 x 37 = 148 colors of ink overall. Therefore, we will need 148 different colors of ink to fill all 1359 pens.
Response:  We know that there are 65 pens in total and we have to distribute them equally among 213 friends. So, each friend will get an average of 0.65 pens per person (65/213). Now, let's find out how many pens each color has. There are 16 different colors of pens, so each color has an average of 0.16 pens per person (16/213). Therefore, the number of pens each color has is as follows:  Black - 0.16 pens Red - 0.16 pens Blue - 0.16 pens Green - 0.16 pens Yellow - 0.16 pens Orange - 0.16 pens Purple - 0.16 pens Pink - 0.16 pens Brown - 0.16 pens Grey - 0.16 pens White - 0.16 pens Total - 0.65 pens
Response:  We know that there are 589 students in the school and they have to bring 161 pens as per the teacher's instruction. So, the total number of pens required is 589 x 161 = 92,790 pens. Now, we need to distribute these pens among the friends equally. Since there are 371 friends, each friend will get (92,790 / 371) = 254 pens.
Response:  We have to make 110 pensil boxes for Pol's birthday party and each box has to contain 90 different colors of pens. So, in total we need 9900 pens (110 x 90). Now, out of these 9900 pens, 412 are blue color. Therefore, we have 9588 pens left (9900 - 412 = 9588).
Response:  We know that Polly has 563 pens and she wants to give one pen to each of her 558 friends on her birthday. So, in total, she needs 558 pens. But then, we are told that there are 332 different colors of pens available. Now, if Polly gives one pen to each of her friends, she will have to choose from these 332 different colors. Therefore, the number of pens Polly can use on her birthday is 332.
"Response:  We know that Polly has 52 pens and she wants to give one pen to each of her 53 friends. So, in total, she needs 53 pens. Now, we are given that there are 492 different colors of pens available. Since Polly can choose any color she likes, let's assume that she chooses 492 different colors. Therefore, the number of pens Polly will have after giving one pen to each of her 53 friends is:

$$ \boxed{53} \times \boxed{492} = 2616 $$

So, the answer is $2616$."
"Response:  We know that there are 52 cards in a deck of playing cards and each card has four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades). So, we have 52 x 4 = 208 possible combinations of suits. Now, let's count how many times each suit appears in the given sequence:

* Hearts - 13 cards (13 x 6 = 78)
* Diamonds - 9 cards (9 x 6 = 54)
* Clubs - 10 cards (10 x 6 = 60)
* Spades - 13 cards (13 x 6 = 78)

So, out of the total number of possible combinations, the number of times each suit appears is:

Hearts - 78/208 = 0.377
Diamonds - 54/208 = 0.263
Clubs - 60/208 = 0.288
Spades - 78/208 = 0.377

Therefore, the probability of drawing any particular suit from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is approximately 0.377 for hearts, 0.263 for diamonds, 0.288 for clubs, and 0.377 for spades."
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are needed for 531 students and how much time is required to fill 391 tubes with ink.  So, we need to divide the number of students by the number of pens available per student.  For this, we will use division.  Division is denoted by the symbol /.  In this case, we have 531 students and 38 pens available per student, so we can calculate the total number of pens needed as follows: Number of pens = Total number of students x Number of pens per student  Number of pens = 531 x 38 = 19,688 Now, let's move on to the second part of the question. We have to find out how long it takes to fill 391 tubes with ink. To do this, we will use multiplication. Multiplication is denoted by the symbol x. In this case, we have 391 tubes and each tube requires 10 ml of ink, so we can calculate the total amount of ink required as follows: Total amount of ink = Number of tubes x Amount of ink per tube  Total amount of ink = 391 x 10 = 3,910 ml Now, we know that one liter is equal to 1000 ml, so we can convert the total amount of ink from milliliters (mL) to liters (L) as follows: Total amount of ink (in L) = Total amount of ink (in mL) / 1000  Total amount of ink (in L) = 3,910 / 1000 = 3.91 liters Finally, we can see that it would take approximately 3.91 hours to fill all 391 tubes with ink, assuming a constant rate of filling. Therefore, the answer to the second part of the question is 3.91 hours.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 601 appears in the pattern of colors and numbers given in the question.  The pattern is as follows:  Every 3 colors are followed by a number that represents the position of the color in the sequence (starting from 1). For example, ""Red"" is at position 1, ""Yellow"" is at position 2, etc.  Now, let's count the number of occurrences of 601 in the pattern:  Red - 1st position = 601 Yellow - 2nd position = 601 Blue - 3rd position = 601 Green - 4th position = 601 Orange - 5th position = 601 Purple - 6th position = 601 So, there are 6 occurrences of 601 in the pattern. Therefore, the answer is 6."
Response:  We have to find out how many pensil are required for each student in a class of 40 students and how much time is taken to complete one batch of 291 pensils.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pensils required per student. Since there are 40 students in the class, and each student requires 315 pensils, therefore, the total number of pensils required for all the students is: Number of pensils = 40 x 315 = 12600 pensils Now, let's assume that it takes 2 hours to complete one batch of 291 pensils. Therefore, the time taken to complete all the pensils can be calculated as follows: Time taken = Total number of pensils / Speed of completion (in hours) = 12600 pensils / 2 hours = 6300 minutes or 105 minutes per penil Now, since there are 40 students in the class, and each student has to complete 105 minutes per penil, therefore, the total time taken by all the students to complete their pensils can be calculated as follows: Total time taken by all students = Number of students x Time taken per student = 40 x 105 minutes = 4200 minutes or 70 minutes per student Finally, since the teacher wants to give the pensils on the birthday of the student, we need to subtract the time taken by the teacher from the total time taken by all the students. Therefore, the time left after deducting the time taken by the teacher can be calculated as follows: Time left after deducting teacher's time = Total time taken by all students - Teacher's time = 4200 minutes - 70 minutes = 4130 minutes So, the teacher will have enough time to distribute the pensils among all the students on the birthday of the last student.
Response:  We know that Polly has 267 pens and she wants to give one pen each to her 308 friends. So, we need to divide 267 by 308 to find out how many pens each friend will get.  Therefore, each friend will receive approximately 0.84 pens (267 / 308).
Response:  We know that Polly is 45 years old and has been working for 320 months. Therefore, her salary per month is $320 x 12 = $3840 per year. Now, we need to calculate how much she can save each month after paying all her expenses. Let's assume her expenses are $2500 per month (which includes rent, food, transportation, etc.). So, her savings per month will be $3840 - $2500 = $1340. Since she wants to save $5230 in total, she needs to save $5230 / 12 = $436 per month.
Response:  We have 11 water tanks and each tank can hold 10 liters of water. So, total capacity of all the water tanks is 11 x 10 = 110 liters. Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the bank after filling three tanks. To do this, we will divide the total capacity of all the tanks (110 liters) by 3, which gives us 36 liters. Therefore, there are 36 liters of water left in the bank after filling three tanks.
Response:  We have three water tanks of capacities 10 liters, 20 liters and 30 liters respectively. A person can carry at most 5 liters of water at a time. Now let's assume that there are three people in total who need to cross the river. The first person has already crossed with 10 liters of water, leaving him/her with 0 liters. The second person has also crossed with 20 liters of water, leaving him/her with 10 liters. The third person is yet to cross and has 30 liters of water. Since each person can only carry 5 liters of water at a time, the third person will be able to carry 6 liters (30 - 5 = 6) of water when he/she crosses the river. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We have 9 water bottles and each bottle contains 1 liter of water. So, in total, we have 9 liters of water. Now, let's assume that 3 more customers come to buy water. Each customer buys 1 liter of water, so now we have 9 + 3 = 12 liters of water in total.
Response:  We have 5 water tanks and each tank can hold 14 liters of water. So, total capacity of all 5 tanks is 5 x 14 = 70 liters. Now, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tanks after filling them completely. To do this, we divide the total capacity of the tanks (70 liters) by the number of tanks (5). So, there will be 70 / 5 = 14 liters of water left in each tank after filling them completely.
Response:  We have 13 water bottles and 9 grackles. Each grackle can hold 4 water bottles in its beak. So, total number of water bottles that one grackle can carry = 9 x 4 = 36 water bottles. Now, we need to find out how many grackles it will take to carry all the 13 water bottles. Therefore, number of grackles required to carry 13 water bottles = 13 / 36 = 0.375 or 3/8 grackles.
Response:  We have 12 water tanks and each tank can hold 10 liters of water. So, total capacity of all the water tanks is: 12 x 10 = 120 liters. Now, we know that 15 tanks are full and 14 tanks are empty. So, total amount of water in the full tanks is: 15 x 10 = 150 liters. And total amount of water in the empty tanks is: 14 x 10 = 140 liters. Therefore, there is a difference of 10 liters between the full and empty tanks.
Response:  We have three water vessels - one large and two small. The large vessel can hold 10 liters of water, and each small vessel can hold 2 liters of water. Now, we need to find out how many new grackles will be added after filling up the large vessel with water. So, let's fill the large vessel first. It can hold 10 liters of water, so if we add 10 liters of water to it, there will be no space left in the vessel. Now, let's add 2 liters of water to each of the two small vessels. Since each small vessel can hold 2 liters of water, they will now hold 4 liters of water in total (2 liters x 2 vessels). Therefore, after adding 2 liters of water to each of the two small vessels, there will be 4 new grackles.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 9 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Since there are 10 numbers in the sequence, we can say that the number 9 appears once in it. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have 12 water tanks and each tank can hold 50 liters of water. So, total capacity of all the water tanks is: 12 x 50 = 600 liters. Now, we need to find out how much water is left in the tanks after filling them up to their full capacity. So, let's subtract the amount of water filled in each tank from its capacity: 600 - (12 x 50) = 600 - 6000 = -5400 liters. Therefore, there are -5400 liters of water left in the tanks.
Response:  We have three options for spending money: buying chocolates (C), dancing (D), and drinking coffee (O). The cost of each activity is as follows: C - $3, D - $5, O - $2. Now, let's calculate how much money we will spend in total if we do all three activities: C + D + O = $3 + $5 + $2 = $10. So, after doing all three activities, we will have spent a total of $10.
Response:  We have to buy three chocolates for $3 each. So, we will spend $9 on buying those chocolates. Now, we have $2 left after buying the chocolates. Therefore, there are $2 left after buying the chocolates.
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Dan will get after selling his car for $30,000 and then divide it equally among the 99 people in the group.

Firstly, we need to find out how many dollars each person will get if the amount is divided equally among all 99 members of the group. To do this, we can use the formula: Total amount / Number of people = Amount per person. In this case, the total amount is $30,000, and there are 99 people in the group, so we can plug these values into the formula to get: $30,000 / 99 = $310 per person.

Now that we know how much each person will get, let's see how much money Dan will get after selling his car. Since he has already spent $27,000 on the car, he will be left with $30,000 - $27,000 = $3,000. So, Dan will get $3,000."
Response:  We have three chocolate bars of different prices - $10, $5, and $3.  If we buy all three together, we will pay a total of $28 (10 + 5 + 3 = 28). Now, if we divide this amount equally among the three chocolate bars, each bar will cost $9 ($28 / 3 = $9).
"Response:  We have to buy chocolates for 6 people at $3 each. So, we need to spend:
$3 x 6 = $18
So, we will buy 18 chocolates."
Response:  Dan bought 2 chocolates worth $3 each and spent $6 overall. He got $4 in change. So, he has $4 left with him.
Response:  We have $7 in dollars and we want to buy chocolates worth $6. So, we will have $1 left over after buying the chocolates. Now, let's calculate how much each chocolate costs. If we buy one bar of chocolate for $8, then each chocolate costs $8 / 1 = $8 per chocolate.
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Dan will spend in total and then find out how many chocolates he can buy with that amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Dan will spend = $6 + $3 = $9

Now we know that Dan has $9 to spend on chocolates. So, if he spends $1 on each chocolate, he can buy 9 chocolates."
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Ollie has after buying 3 chocolates for $2 each and then calculating how much he spent on each chocolate.

Firstly, let's calculate the total amount of money Ollie spent on buying 3 chocolates:
$2 x 3 = $6
So, Ollie spent a total of $6 on buying 3 chocolates.
Now, let's calculate how much money Ollie has left after buying those chocolates:
$10 - $6 = $4
So, Ollie has $4 left after buying those chocolates."
Response:  Dan bought a chocolate bar for $8 and gave $5 to his friend. So, he has $3 left ($8 - $5 = $3).
"Response:  We have three options for buying chocolates - Danak, TinTa, and Chocklet. The price of each bar is given as follows:
Danak: Rs. 10 per bar
Tintat: Rs. 20 per bar
Chocklet: Rs. 30 per bar
Now, we want to know how much will it cost us to buy 4 bars of chocolate if we start with Rs. 40. So, let's calculate the total cost of buying 4 bars of chocolate:
Cost of 1 bar = Price of chocolate x Number of bars bought
= Rs. 10 x 4
= Rs. 40
So, the total cost of buying 4 bars of chocolate is Rs. 40."
Response:  We have to buy three chocolates of Rs 10 each, so the total cost will be Rs 30 (3 x Rs 10). Now, we have Rs 27 left after buying the chocolates (Rs 30 - Rs 3 = Rs 27). So, there is Rs 27 left with us.
Response:  We have three chocolates and we want to know how much they cost in total. Each chocolate costs $1.50, so the total cost of all three chocolates is: $1.50 x 3 = $4.50. Therefore, each chocolate costs $4.50 / 3 = $1.50.
"Response:  We have to buy 5 chocolates at $3 each and 7 chocolates at $7 each. So, total cost of buying both sets of chocolates is:
$3 x 5 = $15 for the first set
$7 x 7 = $49 for the second set
Total cost = $15 + $49 = $64
So, we will spend $64 in total to buy all 12 chocolates."
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Dan spent on chocolates and then find out how much he saved after buying them in bulk.

Question: डैनक चारि डालर अछि । ओ ७ डॉलर मे चॉकलेट आ २ डॉलर मे चॉकलेट बार खरीदलक. ओ चॉकलेट पर कतेक पैसा खर्च केलक ओ चॉकलेट बार पर की?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's break down the calculation:

Dan spent $7 on chocolates at one place and bought them in bulk for $2 each at another place. To find out how much he saved, we need to subtract the cost of buying them in bulk from the total amount he spent.

Cost of buying chocolates in bulk = $2 x 2 = $4
Total amount spent by Dan = $7 + $4 = $11

So, Dan saved $6 ($11 - $5) by buying chocolates in bulk."
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then calculate the percentage of books that are not sold.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 115 books in total. Out of these, 78 books were sold. Now, we need to find out what percentage of books are not sold. To do this, we will divide the number of unsold books (78) by the total number of books (115). Then, multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage. So, the percentage of books that are not sold is: (78/115) x 100 = 69% Therefore, 69% of the books are not sold.
Response:  We know that 137 + 105 = 242. So, there are 242 books in total.
Response:  We know that Polak has 108 books and wants to sell them for Rs. 35 each. So, he will get Rs. 35 x 108 = Rs. 3760 from selling all his books. Now, his friend Gyaraij has offered him Rs. 62 per book. So, if Polak sells all his books, he will get Rs. 62 x 108 = Rs. 6640. Therefore, Polak can make a profit of Rs. 6640 - Rs. 3760 = Rs. 2880 by selling all his books to Gyaraij.
"Response:  We know that Poll is asking for 260 books and he wants to buy them from Geraj Bikriam at Rs.151 each. So, the total cost of buying all these books will be:

Total Cost = Number of Books x Price per Book
= 260 x 151
= 39,100

So, the number of books Poll can buy with this amount is:

Number of Books = Total Cost / Price per Book
= 39,100 / 151
= 260

Therefore, Poll can buy 260 books with the given amount."
"Response:  We know that Poll has 150 tonnes of potatoes and he wants to sell them for Rs 150 per tonne. So, the total amount of money he will get is:

150 tonnes x Rs 150 per tonne = Rs 22,500
Now, we have to calculate how many kitabs (books) Poll can buy with this amount of money. We know that each kitab costs Rs 58, so:

Rs 22,500 / Rs 58 per kitab = 376 kitabs
Therefore, Poll can buy 376 kitabs with the money he will get from selling his potatoes."
Response:  We have to find out how many books Polk will buy if he has Rs 420 with him and he wants to buy at least 15 books.  So, we can start by finding out how much one book costs. According to the question, each book costs Rs 21Ta. Now, let's calculate how many books Polk can buy with his money: Number of books = Total amount of money x Cost of one book Total amount of money = Rs 420 x Cost of one book = Rs 420 x Rs 21Ta = Rs 8,720 Books that Polk can buy = Rs 8,720 / Rs 21Ta = 40 books Therefore, Polk can buy 40 books with the given amount of money.
Response:  We know that Polly has 71 books and she sold 38 of them at Rs. 38 each. So, she earned Rs. 1452 from selling those books. Now, we are asked how much money did she gain if she bought 116 books at Rs. 10 each and sold them at Rs. 15 each. To find out, let's calculate the total amount gained from selling those books: Total amount gained = Number of books sold x Selling price per book Total amount gained = 116 x 15 = Rs. 1790 Now, we need to subtract the amount she spent on buying those books from the total amount gained: Amount gained after buying books = Total amount gained - Cost of buying books Amount gained after buying books = Rs. 1790 - (Rs. 116 x 10) = Rs. 1674 Therefore, Polly gained Rs. 1674 by buying and selling books.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then calculate the cost of each book.  So, let's break down the given information into smaller parts:  Total number of books = 108 Total number of pages = 550 Number of pens = 66 Cost per pen = Rs 20 Now, we need to find out how much is the total cost of all the books together. To do this, we will multiply the total number of books with the cost per pen: Total cost = Total number of books x Cost per pen = 108 x 20 = Rs 2160 Finally, we get the answer as Rs 2160.
"Response:  We have 51 tablespoons of oil and we want to sell them for Rs 82 each. So, the total amount we will get is:

51 x 82 = Rs 4160
Now, we have 106 tablespoons of oil left after selling 51 tablespoons. So, the remaining amount we will get from these 106 tablespoons is:

106 x 82 = Rs 8532
So, in total, we will get Rs 4160 + Rs 8532 = Rs 12692 from all the oil."
Response:  We have to find out how many books Poll can sell in total and then calculate how much he will get from each book.  So, let's break down the given information:  Book price = Rs. 270 per book Total number of books = 270 books x Number of books sold = 136 books (since he has already sold 136 books) Remaining books = Total number of books - Sold books = 270 - 136 = 134 books Now, we need to calculate how much Poll will get from each remaining book: Price per book = Total revenue / Number of remaining books = Rs. 270 / 134 = Rs. 200 per book Therefore, if Poll sells all 134 remaining books, he will get a total revenue of Rs. 200 x 134 = Rs. 27,800.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are left after selling 39 books and buying 68 books from the same shop. So, we subtract 39 from 68: 68 - 39 = 29. Therefore, there are 29 books left in the shop.
Response:  We have 95 books and we want to sell them in 13 batches of 7 books each. So, the total number of batches is 95 / 7 = 13. Now, each batch contains 7 books, so the total number of books sold is 13 x 7 = 91 books. Therefore, the remaining 4 books are left over after selling all the 95 books.
"Response:  We have 42 tonnes of coal and we want to sell it for Rs 113 per tonne. So, total revenue will be:

42 tonnes x Rs 113/tonne = Rs 4756
Now, we have to pay Rs 19 per kilogram of potato. So, total cost of potatoes will be:

143 kg / 1000 kg (conversion factor) x Rs 19/kg = Rs 1430
Total profit will be:

Rs 4756 - Rs 1430 = Rs 3326
So, the owner of the bike can make a profit of Rs 3326 by selling the coal and buying potatoes."
"Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are there in the garden and then calculate the number of red roses among them.  So, let's start counting the flowers one by one:

1. First flower - Red rose
2. Second flower - Yellow daisy
3. Third flower - Pink carnation
4. Fourth flower - Bluebell
5. Fifth flower - Purple lily
6. Sixth flower - Orange marigold
7. Seventh flower - White chrysanthemum
8. Eighth flower - Green fern
9. Ninth flower - Lavender
10. Tenth flower - Daffodil

Now, we know that there are ten flowers in total in the garden. Among these, three are red roses, so the answer is:

Number of red roses = 3"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 bags of flowers in total. Now, out of these 16 bags, 8 bags contain red roses and 8 bags contain white lilies. So, the number of red roses is 8 x 8 = 64. Similarly, the number of white lilies is also 8 x 8 = 64. Therefore, the total number of flowers in both the groups is 64 + 64 = 128. Now, as per the question, 23 bags of flowers are kept in the first row, so the number of flowers in each bag is 128 / 23 = 5.5 bags.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many flowers are in the garden. The question says there are 23 flowers in the garden. Now, we need to calculate how much space each flower takes up. According to the question, each flower takes up 1/4 of a square meter. So, if there are 23 flowers in the garden, then the total area of the garden is: Area = Number of flowers x Space taken up by each flower = 23 x 1/4 = 5.75 square meters. Therefore, the answer is 5.75.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many flowers are there in the field. The question states that there are 17 tulips in the field. So, the total number of flowers in the field is 17. Now, we need to calculate how much time it will take for 33 tulips to bloom. As each tulip takes 20 days to bloom, it will take 33 x 20 = 660 days for all 33 tulips to bloom. Therefore, the answer is 660 days.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 210 tulips and 34 roses. So, the total number of flowers in the garden is = 210 + 34 = 244 flowers. Now, we are asked how many flowers will be left after cutting 15 tulips and 5 roses from the garden. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of flowers that will be cut (15 tulips and 5 roses) from the total number of flowers in the garden. Therefore, the number of flowers left after cutting = Total number of flowers - Number of flowers cut = 244 - (15 x 10) = 244 - 150 = 94 flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden as follows: Total Number of Flowers = (Number of Guavas x Number of Petals per Guava) + (Number of Roses x Number of Petals per Rose) Total Number of Flowers = 59 x 6 + 20 x 4 = 378 flowers Now, let's find out how many guavas are left after cutting 20 guavas from the tree: Remaining Guavas = Total Number of Guavas - Number of Guavas Cut = 378 - 20 = 358 guavas Therefore, there are 358 guavas left in the garden after cutting 20 guavas from the tree.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 120. Now, out of these, 21 are already picked by Jesus. So, the remaining flowers in the garden are 120 - 21 = 99. Finally, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of bags that can be filled, which is 21. Therefore, the number of bags that can be filled with flowers from the garden is 99 / 21 = 4.5 bags.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in both gardens combined. The total number of flowers in the first garden is 15 tonnes and in the second garden it is 62 tonnes. So, the total number of flowers in both gardens together is:

15 tonnes + 62 tonnes = 77 tonnes

Now, we need to find out how many bags of 17 kg each can be filled with these flowers. To do this, we divide the total number of flowers by 17:

77 tonnes / 17 kg per bag = 4.5 bags

So, approximately 4.5 bags of 17 kg each can be filled with the flowers from both gardens."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in both baskets. The first basket has 12 flowers and the second basket has 20 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 12 + 20 = 32 flowers. Now, we need to subtract the number of flowers that Jessica picked from the first basket. She picked 8 flowers from it, so the remaining flowers are 32 - 8 = 24 flowers. Finally, we need to add the number of oranges that Jessica picked from the second basket. She picked 15 oranges, so the total number of fruits (oranges and flowers) that Jessica picked is 24 + 15 = 39 fruits.
"Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are there in total and then calculate the number of red roses among them.  So, let's start counting the flowers one by one:

1. First flower - Red rose
2. Second flower - Yellow daisy
3. Third flower - Pink carnation
4. Fourth flower - Bluebell (not mentioned in the question)
5. Fifth flower - Orange marigold
6. Sixth flower - Purple lily
7. Seventh flower - White chrysanthemum
8. Eighth flower - Green bamboo (not mentioned in the question)
9. Ninth flower - Red tulip
10. Tenth flower - Violet (not mentioned in the question)

Now, we know that there are 12 flowers in total. Among them, 3 are red roses, which means that 3/12 = 0.25 or 25% of the flowers are red roses."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 110 tulips and 20 orchids. So, the total number of flowers in the garden is = 110 + 20 = 130. Now, we need to find out how many bunches of flowers are there in the garden. We know that each bunch contains 4-5 flowers, so the total number of bunches of flowers in the garden is = 130 / 4 = 32.5 bunches. Since we can't have half a bunch, the actual number of bunches of flowers in the garden is = 32. Therefore, the number of bunches of flowers in the garden is 32.
"Response:  Jessica has 19 tulips in her garden and wants to know how many gulabs (a type of flower) she can plant there. If she plants three gulabs per square meter, then the number of gulabs she can plant in her garden is:

Number of gulabs = Total area of the garden / Area per gulab
= 19 tulips x 4 meters^2 / 3 gulabs/meter^2
= 63 gulabs
Therefore, Jessica can plant 63 gulabs in her garden if she wants to use all the space for them."
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 13 tauns (or 130) and the total number of orchids which is given as 84 tauns (or 840). So, the total number of flowers and orchids in the garden are:

Flowers = 13 tauns x 100 = 1300
Orchids = 84 tauns x 100 = 8400

Now, we need to find out how many times the area of the flower bed can be covered with orchids. We know that there are 91 tonnes of salami flowers and 14 tonnes of orchids in the garden. So, the ratio of salami flowers to orchids is:

Salami flowers : Orchids = 91 : 14

To cover the entire area of the flower bed with orchids, we need to divide the total number of orchids by this ratio:

Number of orchids needed to cover the entire area = Total number of orchids / Ratio of salami flowers to orchids
= 8400 / 91 : 14
= 926.36 (approximately)

So, approximately 926 orchids would be needed to cover the entire area of the flower bed."
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 16 taulas (or 16 x 4 = 64). Now, out of these 64 flowers, 3 are orkids and 13 are gulabs. So, the total number of gulabs in the garden is 13 x 4 = 52. Therefore, the remaining 12 - 52 = 40 flowers are salamis.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 60 tonnes. Then, we need to subtract the number of salami flowers (21 tonnes) and Gulab (22 tonnes). So, the remaining number of flowers are: 60 - 21 = 39 tonnes. Now, we have to divide the remaining number of flowers by the number of Orkid flowers (which is not mentioned in the question). Therefore, the number of Orkid flowers in the garden can be calculated as follows:  Number of Orkid flowers = Total number of flowers / Number of Salami flowers = 39 / 21 = 1.85 Orkid flowers per ton.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of flowers in the garden which is given as 9 Tulips and 6 Orchids. So, the total number of flowers = 9 + 6 = 15. Now, we need to find out how many Salami flowers are there in the garden. The ratio of Salami flowers to other flowers is given as 3:2 i.e., for every 3 Tulips, there are 2 Salami flowers. Therefore, the number of Salami flowers = (3 x 15) / 2 = 18. Finally, we get the answer that there are 18 Salami flowers in the garden.
Response:  The length of Robinka's kite is 17 inches and he wants to cut it into pieces of equal length. If each piece is 3 inches long, then how many pieces can he make?  Therefore, the number of pieces that Robinka can make is 17 / 3 = 5.
"Response:  We have to find out how many inches Robbin can stretch his cap if he stretches it for 20 minutes and then calculates how much longer or shorter Kesh will be after 10 minutes of stretching.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Time taken by Robbin to stretch his cap = 20 minutes
2. Distance covered by Robbin in one minute = 60 seconds / 60 = 1 inch per minute (assuming 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds)
3. Total distance covered by Robbin in 20 minutes = 20 x 1 = 20 inches
4. Remaining distance left for Kesh to stretch his cap = Total distance covered by Robbin - Distance covered by Kesh in 10 minutes
5. Distance covered by Kesh in 10 minutes = Total distance covered by Robbin / 2 (as Kesh takes half the time taken by Robbin to stretch his cap)
6. Distance covered by Kesh in 10 minutes = 20 inches / 2 = 10 inches
7. Length of Kesh's cap after 10 minutes of stretching = Original length + Distance covered by Kesh in 10 minutes
8. Length of Kesh's cap after 10 minutes = 10 inches + 10 inches = 20 inches
9. Difference between original length and new length of Kesh's cap = New length - Original length
10. Difference between original length and new length of Kesh's cap = 20 inches - 10 inches = 10 inches

Therefore, the answer is 10 inches."
Response:  We know that the length of Robin's kite is 16 inches and its tail is 11 inches long. If we add 12 inches to the length of the kite, it will become longer by 3 feet (12 inches x 3 = 36 inches). So, the new length of the kite after adding 12 inches to its length is 19 feet (16 + 36 = 52 inches). Therefore, the length of Robin's kite after adding 12 inches to its length is 19 feet or 52 inches.
Response:  We know that the height of Robin is 5 feet 9 inches (190 cm). Now, we need to find out how many times the height of Robin can be accommodated in the length of the boat.  The length of the boat is given as 18 feet (540 cm). So, we divide the height of Robin by the length of the boat to get the number of times his height can fit inside the boat:  Height of Robin = 5 ft 9 in = 190 cm Length of boat = 18 ft = 540 cm Number of times Robin's height fits in the boat = Height of Robin / Length of boat = 190 cm / 540 cm = 3.6  Therefore, approximately 3.6 times the height of Robin can fit inside the boat.
Response:  If Robin cut off his hair of length 13 inches and then grew it to 14 inches long again, how much longer is his new hair than the original length? So, the difference in length between the two lengths is 14 - 13 = 1 inch. Therefore, Robin's new hair is 1 inch longer than the original length.
Response:  The height of Robin is 14 inches and he grows another 8 inches taller. So his new height is 22 inches (14 + 8). Now, there are 20 inches in one foot, so we can convert Robin's height from inches to feet as follows: 22 inches = 20 feet x ⅔ = 13 feet 6 inches. Therefore, Robin is 13 feet 6 inches tall.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in a truck with a capacity of 12 tons.  To do this, we need to know the volume of one bottle of water.  The volume of one liter of water is 1000 milliliters (mL). So, the volume of one bottle of water is 1 L = 1000 mL. Now, let's calculate the number of bottles that can fit in a truck with a capacity of 12 tons. We know that 1 ton = 1000 kg, so the capacity of the truck in kilograms is 12 tons x 1000 kg/ton = 12000 kg. Since the volume of one bottle of water is 1 L, we can divide the total capacity of the truck by the volume of one bottle to get an estimate of how many bottles can fit in the truck: Number of bottles = Total capacity of truck / Volume of one bottle = 12000 kg / 1000 mL = 1200000 mL / 1000 mL = 12 million bottles. Therefore, if there are 53 bottles of water in the park, it means that only about 467,000 bottles can fit in the truck (53 bottles / 12 million bottles = 0.00467 million bottles).
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in a truck with a capacity of 21 tons. To do this, we need to know the volume of one bottle of water. Lets assume that each bottle of water has a volume of 18 liters (which is a reasonable estimate). Now, let's calculate the total volume of 53 bottles of water: Volume of 53 bottles = Number of bottles x Volume of one bottle = 53 x 18 = 946 liters So now we know that 53 bottles of water can fit in a truck with a capacity of 21 tons. But wait! There are more details to consider... The question also asks us to imagine that there are some empty spaces inside the truck due to the shape of the bottles. Let's assume that these empty spaces take up about 10% of the total space in the truck (this is just an estimate, and you may want to adjust it based on your own knowledge or experience). So, if we subtract 10% of the total volume from the calculated volume of 53 bottles, we get: Actual volume of 53 bottles = Calculated volume - Empty space = 946 - 53 = 893 liters Therefore, we can fit approximately 893 liters of bottled water in a truck with a capacity of 21 tons, assuming that the bottles are arranged efficiently without any gaps and taking into account the shape of the bottles.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in an old pickup truck with a capacity of 630 liters. To do this, we need to divide the capacity of the truck (630 liters) by the volume of one bottle of water (1 liter). So, we get: Number of bottles = Capacity of truck / Volume of one bottle = 630 liters / 1 liter = 630 bottles Now, let's assume that each bottle takes up half the space of the truck bed. Therefore, the number of bottles that can be placed side by side in the truck bed is equal to the total length of the truck bed divided by twice the width of a single bottle. Using the dimensions given in the problem, we know that the length of the truck bed is 510 cm and the width of a single bottle is 27 cm. So, we get: Number of bottles = Length of truck bed / (2 x Width of a single bottle) = 510 cm / (2 x 27 cm) = 184 bottles Therefore, there are approximately 184 bottles of water that can fit in the old pickup truck.
Response:  We have 36 bottles of water in total (including the old one). If we take out 22 bottles from the park, then how many bottles will be left in the park? So, there are 14 bottles left in the park. Now, let's calculate the number of bottles that Ollie has taken with him. Since he took 35 bottles, and there were 14 bottles left in the park, then Ollie has taken 21 bottles from the park (35 - 14 = 21).
Response:  We have 30 bottles of water in one park and we want to distribute them equally among 42 people. So, each person will get 0.71 bottle (30/42). Now, let's consider the old man who has 63 bottles of water. He will get more than his share as he already has a lot of water. So, we will give him 0.85 bottles (63/76), which is more than his actual share. Therefore, the total number of bottles distributed among all 42 people including the old man is: 0.71 + 0.85 = 1.56 bottles per person.
Response:  We have 22 bottles of drinking water in one park and 8 bottles of bandage in another park. So, if we add both parks together, we get 28 bottles of drinking water + 8 bottles of bandages = 36 bottles.
Response:  We have 22 bottles of drinking water in total and we want to pack them into boxes of 30 bottles each. So, we will need 7 boxes (22 / 30 = 7). Now, there are 17 bottles left over after packing 7 boxes (55 - 7 = 17). Therefore, Denny has 17 extra bottles of drinking water.
Response:  We have 30 bottles of water in one park and 14 bottles of juice in another park. If we take 7 bottles of water from the first park and add them to the second park, how many bottles of water will be left in the first park?  Therefore, there will be 23 bottles of water left in the first park (30 - 7 = 23).
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in one truck and then calculate how much space is left after filling up all the trucks with water from the park.  The question states that there are 11 bottles per top, so we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of tops to get the number of bottles per top. In this case, there are 680 bottles. Now, let's assume each top holds 28 bottles (as stated in the question). Therefore, we have 680 / 28 = 25 tops. Since there are 11 bottles per top, we have 25 x 11 = 275 bottles of water that can fit in one truck. Now, let's move on to calculating the remaining space in the trucks after filling them up with water from the park. According to the question, there are 28 tons of water in each truck, which means there are 28 x 28 = 784 tons of water in total. If we subtract the number of bottles we calculated earlier (275) from the total amount of water in the trucks, we get 784 - 275 = 509 tons of water left over after filling all the trucks with water from the park.
Response:  We have 71 bottles of water in total and we want to pack them into boxes of 24 bottles each. So, we will need 3 boxes of water. However, there are only 28 bottles left after packing 71 bottles into 3 boxes, so we will have 5 extra bottles left over. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have 10 bottles of water in total (including the one that is already empty).  If we fill each bottle with 27 ml of water, then we will have 27 x 10 = 270 ml of water in total.  Since there are 62 ml of water in each bottle, we can calculate the number of full bottles as follows:  Number of full bottles = Total amount of water / Amount of water in each bottle = 270 ml / 62 ml = 4.35 bottles. Therefore, there will be 4 full bottles and 6 partially filled bottles.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in a car with a capacity of 66 liters. To do this, we need to divide the capacity of the car by the volume of one bottle of water. The volume of one bottle of water is 250 milliliters (mL). So, we can calculate the number of bottles as follows: Number of bottles = Capacity of car / Volume of one bottle = 66 L / 250 mL = 260 bottles Now, let's check if Denny's claim that he has 300 bottles is true or not. Yes, it is true! Denny has indeed 300 bottles of water.
Response:  We have 32 bottles of water in total. If we take out 8 bottles from the park, then there will be 24 bottles left in the park. Now, if we add 16 more bottles to the park, there will be 40 bottles in total (24 + 16 = 40). So, the answer is 40.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in a container with a volume of 60 liters. To do this, we need to divide the volume of the container (60 liters) by the volume of each bottle of water (1 liter). So, we get: Number of bottles = Volume of container / Volume of one bottle = 60 liters / 1 liter = 60 bottles Now, we are asked how many bottles of water can fit in a container that has a capacity of 58 liters. To find this out, we need to use the same formula as before: Number of bottles = Volume of container / Volume of one bottle = 58 liters / 1 liter = 58 bottles Therefore, there can fit 58 bottles of water in a container with a capacity of 58 liters.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of Danish beer can fit in a new batch of 50 tons of beer.  Firstly, we need to convert the weight of beer from tons to kilograms. There are 1000 kg in 1 ton, so 50 tons is equal to 50 x 1000 = 50,000 kg.  Next, we need to calculate the volume of one bottle of beer in liters. The capacity of a standard 33 cl bottle of beer is approximately 33 liters. Therefore, the total volume of beer that can fit in one batch of 50,000 kg is:  Volume of beer = 50,000 kg / 33 L = 1562.5 liters.  Now, we need to divide this total volume by the volume of each bottle (33 liters) to get an estimate of how many bottles can fit in the entire batch: Number of bottles = Total volume of beer / Volume of each bottle = 1562.5 L / 33 L = 47.8 bottles. So, approximately 47.8 bottles of Danish beer can fit in a new batch of 50 tons of beer.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in the old box (which is 54 tonnes). Since we know that the new box has a capacity of 48 tonnes, so we need to subtract the weight of the empty box from the total weight of the water to get the actual weight of the water. So, the weight of water = Total weight of water - Empty box weight = 54 tonnes x 48 tonnes / 2 = 1600 kg Now, we know that each bottle of water weighs approximately 1.5 kg, so we can calculate the number of bottles as follows Number of bottles = Total weight of water / Weight of one bottle = 1600 kg / 1.5 kg = 1067 bottles Therefore, there are approximately 1067 bottles of water that can fit in the old box.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water can fit in an 82-ton truck and then calculate how much space is left after loading 42 tons of bottled water into it.  The volume of one ton of water is equal to 1000 liters (L). So, the volume of 82 tons of water = 82 x 1000 L = 82,000 L. Now, let's assume that each bottle of water has a capacity of 500 ml. Therefore, the number of bottles that can fit in an 82-ton truck = 82,000 L / 500 ml per bottle = 164,000 bottles. Since we want to know how much space is left after loading 42 tons of bottled water, we subtract this amount from the total volume of the truck: 164,000 - 42,000 = 122,000 bottles.
"Response:  We have:

* 66 bottles in total (including the one that is already empty)
* 39 full bottles
* 16 empty bottles

So, the number of full bottles minus the number of empty bottles is:

39 - 16 = 23

Therefore, there are 23 full bottles left after 66 bottles were used and some emptied."
"Response:  We know that there are 46 trees in the park and each tree has 5 branches. So, the total number of branches in the park is:

46 x 5 = 230 branches

Now, we need to calculate how many bottles can be hung from these branches. Each branch can hold 21 bottles, so the total number of bottles that can be hung from all the branches in the park is:

230 branches x 21 bottles per branch = 4730 bottles

Therefore, there are approximately 4730 bottles hanging in the park."
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of 31 bottles each are required to fill up the total capacity of 650 liters in the park.  So, we need to divide the total capacity by the capacity of one packet: 650 liters / 31 bottles = 21.35 packets. Since you cannot have a fraction of a packet, we round off the result to the nearest whole number: 21 packets. Therefore, there will be 21 packets of 31 bottles each needed to fill up the total capacity of 650 liters in the park.
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of water Danine can fill from the tank in 58 minutes.  The tank has 250 liters of water and Danine fills at a rate of 11 liters per minute. So, she can fill 250/11 = 23 liters of water in one minute. Now, we need to calculate how many minutes it takes her to fill 58 liters of water. 58 / 23 = 2.56 minutes. Therefore, Danine can fill 58 liters of water in approximately 2.56 minutes.
Response:  We have 15 bottles of water in one package and 18 packages of water in another package. So, we have total 270 bottles (15 x 18 = 270). Now, out of these 270 bottles, 67 are defective (67/270 = 0.25). Therefore, there are 353 non-defective bottles left (353 - 67 = 286).
"Response:  We have to find out how many 11-digit numbers are less than or equal to 17 digits. To do this, we need to count the number of 11-digit numbers that are less than or equal to 17 digits.

Let's assume that there are x 11-digit numbers less than or equal to 17 digits. Then, we can write an equation based on the given information:

x = Number of 11-digit numbers less than or equal to 17 digits

Now, let's analyze the options:
Option A: 110000000 - This is not an 11-digit number as it has only 9 digits.
Option B: 11000000 - This is also not an 11-digit number as it has only 9 digits.
Option C: 1100000 - This is an 11-digit number but it is greater than 17 digits (18 digits).
Option D: 110000 - This is an 11-digit number and it is less than or equal to 17 digits (16 digits). Therefore, option D is the correct answer. So, the answer is 110000."
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 less apples than Steve and Steve has 14 more apples than Jill. So, if Jill has x apples, then Steve has x + 14 apples and Jack has x - 7 apples. Therefore, Jack has 9 apples (x = 13).
Response:  We know that Jack has 18 apples and he wants to share them equally among 4 of his friends. So, each friend will get 18/4 = 4.5 apples. But since we can't have half an apple, each friend will get 4 whole apples. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If Jill has 13 apples and she wants to distribute them equally among 6 of her friends, then each friend will get 13/6 = 2.17 apples. Since we can't have decimal parts, each friend will get 2 whole apples. Therefore, the total number of apples distributed is 4 + 2 = 6 apples.
Response:  We know that there are three beats in each jack (J), and eight beats in each basi (B). So, we have: J = 3, B = 8. Now, let's find out how many beats there are in one station of six stages: Station = 6 x J = 6 x 3 = 18 beats. Therefore, there are 18 beats in one station of six stages.
Response:  We know that Jack has 12 passes and he wants to give 4 of them to Jill. So, we need to find out how many passes Jack will have left after giving 4 passes to Jill.  We can do this by subtracting the number of passes Jack gives to Jill from his total number of passes.  Therefore, Jack will have 8 passes left (12 - 4 = 8).
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 passes and he wants to give 9 balls to Jill. So, we need to subtract 7 from 9 to get the number of balls left with Jack. Therefore, there are 2 balls left with Jack (9 - 7 = 2). Now, let's consider the size of each ball. If each ball is 16 tumors in diameter, then the total area of all the balls given to Jill would be 2 x 16 = 32 tumors.
"Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate the number of balls that are left after 7 balls are taken from the first basket and 8 balls are added to the second basket. So, let's do it!

Total number of balls = 17 (as given in the question)
Number of balls taken from the first basket = 7
Number of balls remaining in the first basket = Total number of balls - Number of balls taken = 17 - 7 = 10
Number of balls added to the second basket = 8
Number of balls in the second basket = Number of balls added + Number of balls remaining = 8 + 10 = 18
So, the number of balls left in the second basket is 18."
Response:  We know that Jack has 9 cows and he wants to sell them for Rs 18 per head. So, if he sells all his cows, he will get Rs 160 (9 x Rs 18). Now, we need to find out how many heads of cattle he can buy with this amount. To do this, we divide the total amount he got from selling his cows by the price he sold each cow for: Rs 160 / Rs 18 = 9 heads of cattle. Therefore, Jack can buy 9 heads of cattle with the money he got from selling his 9 cows.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 cows and Steve has 18 bales of hay. Each cow produces 50 kg of milk per day, so Jack's cows produce 300 kg of milk per day (6 cows x 50 kg/cow/day). Similarly, each bale of hay weighs 40 kg, so Steve has 720 kg of hay (18 bales x 40 kg/bale). Now, let's calculate how much milk Jack can sell if he sells all his cows to Steve. If Jack sells all his cows to Steve, then Steve will get 6 x 50 kg = 300 kg of milk per day from Jack. So, Jack can sell 300 kg of milk per day to Steve. Therefore, the answer is 300 kg.
Response:  We know that Jack has 5 stations and each station has 18 tanks. So, the total number of tanks is 5 x 18 = 90 tanks. Now, we are told that there are 87 tanks in the field. Therefore, the difference between the number of tanks in the field and the number of tanks at the station is: 90 - 87 = 3 tanks. So, there are 3 tanks more in the field than at the station.
"Response:  We know that Jack has 16 camels and he wants to exchange them for 15 tons of basil. So, we need to find out how many camels will be left with him after exchanging 1 ton of basil. Now, we have:

Number of camels = 16
Weight of basil = 15 tons
Weight of one camel = 70 kg (as per the question)
Now, let's calculate the number of camels that can be obtained from 1 ton of basil:

Number of camels = Weight of basil / Weight of one camel
= 15 tons / 70 kg
= 214.29 camels
So, if Jack exchanges 1 ton of basil for 15 tons of basil, he will get 214.29 camels back. Therefore, the answer is 214."
Response:  We know that Jack has 12 apples and he wants to share them equally among 79 students in his school. So, each student will get = (Total number of apples / Number of students) = (12 apples / 79 students) = 0.15 apples per student. Now, we need to find out how many apples Jack will have after sharing them with the students. Therefore, we can subtract the total number of apples he will give to the students from the original number of apples he had = (Original number of apples - Total number of apples given to students) = (12 apples - x apples where x is the number of apples Jack will give to the students). Since Jack wants to keep 14 apples for himself, we can set this value as the minimum amount he will have after giving away the apples to the students. Therefore, the final equation becomes: x >= 12 - 79x/100 = 14. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. So, Jack will have 18 apples left after sharing them with the students.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 apples and he wants to share them equally among 3 basins. So, each basin will get 4 apples (13/3 = 4). Now, we have 9 apples left with Jack, which he can distribute among 2 basins. Therefore, each basin will get 4.5 apples (9/2 = 4.5).
Response:  We know that there are 6 jackets and 8 basins in total. So, we have to divide the number of jackets among the basins such that each basin gets an equal number of jackets. Since there are 17 trays and 16 seeds, we can distribute 17 jackets among them as follows: Jacket 1 goes with Basin 1, Jacket 2 goes with Basin 2,..., Jacket 17 goes with Basin 16. Now, let's count how many jackets are left over after distributing them equally among all basins: There are 6 - 1 = 5 jackets left over. Therefore, some basins may have more than one jacket.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are required for 30 baskets of wheat and how much space is available in the station.  From the question, we know that there are 12 tons of wheat and 15 tons of seeds available at the station. So, the total weight of seeds available = 12 + 15 = 27 tons. Now, we need to calculate the number of seeds required for 30 baskets of wheat. To do this, we will use the formula: Number of seeds = Total weight of seeds / Weight of one basket of wheat x Number of baskets of wheat. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of seeds = 27 tons / (15 tons/basket) x 30 baskets = 495,000 seeds. Therefore, there are approximately 495,000 seeds available in the station.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice are required for each village and then calculate the total number of bags needed for all the villages.  For Village 1, we need 12 bags of rice as per the question.  For Village 2, we need 4 bags of rice as per the question. So, the total number of bags of rice required for both villages is 12 + 4 = 16 bags. Now, let's move on to the next village. For Village 3, we need 75 bags of rice as per the question. Therefore, the total number of bags of rice required for all three villages is 16 + 75 = 91 bags.
"Response:  We have to find out how many 18-tooth gears are needed to cover 12 teeth less than 36 teeth and how many 8-tooth gears are needed to cover 4 teeth less than 12 teeth.  So, we need:

For 18-tooth gears: 36 - 12 = 24 gears
For 8-tooth gears: 12 - 4 = 8 gears"
"Response:  We know that there are 19 tires in total and we have to find out how many tires Jack has. So, let's start with the first part of the question - ""There are 12 cars less than Steve."" This means that Steve has 12 fewer cars than the total number of cars. Therefore, the number of cars Steve has is equal to the total number of cars minus 12. Now, we can use this information to calculate the number of tires Jack has. Since Jack has 72 more basements than Steve, the number of tires Jack has is equal to the number of tires Steve has plus 72. So, the final answer is: Number of tires Jack has = (Total number of cars - 12) + 72 = 84 tires."
Response:  We have to find out how many trees are there in station 14 and then calculate the average height of those trees. So, we need to know the number of trees in each plot of land. From the question, we come to know that there are 6 plots of land in total, and each plot has 3 beds of trees. Therefore, the total number of trees in all the plots is 6 x 3 = 18 trees. Now, let's assume that the average height of each tree is 20 feet (which is a rough estimate). So, the total height of all the trees in the station is 18 x 20 = 360 feet.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are required for 84 tons of sugarcane juice and then calculate how much water is needed for that amount of juice.  Firstly, we need to convert the weight from tons to kilograms. There are 1000 kg in one ton, so 84 tons = 84,000 kg. Now, we know that 1 seed produces 0.67 liters of juice, so we can calculate the total volume of juice required as follows: Total volume of juice = Number of seeds x Volume of juice per seed Total volume of juice = 84,000 kg x 0.67 L/seed = 56,960 L (approximately) Therefore, we require approximately 56,960 liters of water to produce 84 tons of sugarcane juice.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 tonnes of seeds and wants to exchange them for 17 tonnes of apples. So, he will have to give some amount of seeds in exchange for each tone of apples. Now, we know that there are 8 tonnes of apples available at the station, so Jack can get 8/13 = 0.6154 tonnes of apples from those 8 tonnes (since there are 13 tonnes of seeds). Therefore, Jack will have 13 - 0.6154 = 12.3846 tonnes of seeds left after exchanging 8 tonnes of apples.
Response:  We know that Jack has 8 big apples and wants to share them equally among 10 students in his class. So, each student will get 0.8 big apple (8/10). Now, we also know that each small apple is equal to 1/2 of a big apple. Therefore, if Jack gives 1 small apple to each of the 10 students, he will have 10 x 1 = 10 small apples left over after sharing the big apples.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are required for 3 baskets of 15 tomatoes each and then calculate the total number of seeds needed.  So, we need 3 x 15 = 45 tomatoes in total. Now, let's assume that one seed can produce 2-3 tomato plants. So, we will need around 45 / 2 = 22.5 seeds to grow all those tomatoes. Therefore, the answer is 22.5 seeds.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the supermarket items. The cost of each item is given as $15 per dollar. So, if Oliva buys 78 bags of chips, the total cost would be:

$15 x 78 = $1200

Now, let's find out how much money Olive has left after buying these items. According to the question, she had $78 in her wallet initially. After buying the supermarket items, she spent $1200. Therefore, the amount of money Olive has left is:

$78 - $1200 = $-1122

So, Olive has $1122 left in her wallet."
Response:  Oliva spends $78 on a supermarket bill. If she starts with $33 in her purse and adds $45 every time she makes a purchase, how much will she have after buying 33 items?  So, after buying 33 items, Olivia will have $119 ($33 + (33 x $45)) in her purse.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Oliva spent on Batuaam and Supermarkets. The cost of Batuaam is $100, and he spent $148 on it. Therefore, the total amount spent on Batuaam is $148 + $100 = $248. Now, let's move on to Supermarkets. He spent $159 on Supermarkets. So, the total amount spent on Supermarkets is $159. Finally, we add both these amounts together to get the total amount of money that Oliva spent: $248 + $159 = $367.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Oliva spent on three supermarkets. According to the question, she spent $49 at Supermarket A, $49 at Supermarket B, and $49 at Supermarket C. Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is: $$49 + $49 + $49 = $147$$ Now, we need to find out how much money Olive has left after buying these three supermarkets. According to the question, she had $80 with her initially, and she spent $147 on the supermarkets. So, the amount of money she has left is: $$80 - $147 = -$67$$ Since it is not possible to have negative money, we can conclude that Olive does not have any money left after buying those three supermarkets.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Oliva spent on the supermarket bill. According to the question, Oliva spent $53 on the supermarket bill and got $91 as change from the cashier. So, the total amount of money Oliva spent is: $53 + $91 = $144. Now, let's find out how much money Oliva saved after buying the supermarket items. According to the question, Oliva bought some items worth $144 and paid with an $100 bill. So, the remaining amount Oliva paid is: $144 - $100 = $44. Therefore, the difference between what Oliva paid and what he actually owed is $44.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of the supermarket items that Oliva wants to buy. The cost of each item is given in the question as follows:

* Bread (10 loaves x $2.50 per loaf) = $25
* Butter (10 sticks x $3.00 per stick) = $30
* Milk (1 gallon x $3.50 per gallon) = $35
* Eggs (1 dozen x $2.00 per dozen) = $20
* Cheese (1 block x $7.00 per block) = $70
* Chicken (1 pack x $10.00 per pack) = $100
* Vegetables (1 bag x $5.00 per bag) = $50
* Fruits (1 bag x $7.00 per bag) = $70
* Meat (1 pack x $15.00 per pack) = $150

Total cost of supermarket items = $25 + $30 + $35 + $20 + $70 + $100 + $50 + $70 + $150 = $820

Now, we need to find out how much money Oliva has left after buying all these items. We know that she had $260 with her initially and she spent $820 on supermarket items. Therefore, the amount of money Oliva has left = $260 - $820 = $-560.

So, the answer to the question is $-560."
Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of oil are required to fill up the tank with 54 liters of fuel.  Firstly, we need to convert the volume of fuel from liters to milliliters (mL). There are 1000 mL in one liter, so 54 liters is equal to 54,000 mL. Now, we know that each bottle of oil can hold 29 mL, so we need to divide the total amount of fuel required by the capacity of each bottle: 54,000 mL / 29 mL = 1867 bottles. Therefore, it will take 1867 bottles of oil to fill up the tank with 54 liters of fuel.
Response:  Oliva spends $38 on supermarket shopping. If she starts with $128 and pays $0.40 per item, then she will have $96 left after buying all items. So, the amount of money she has left is $96.
Response:  Dev has 19 apps in his phone and he wants to delete 5 of them. So, out of 19, he will have 14 apps left after deleting 5.
Response:  Dev has 18 metals in his bag and he gives 5 of them to someone else. So, initially, Dev had 18 - 5 = 13 metals in his bag. Now, after giving 5 metals away, Dev has 13 - 5 = 8 metals left in his bag. Therefore, the number of metals Dev has left in his bag is 8.
Response:  Dev has 10 apps in his phone and he wants to delete 3 of them. He has already deleted 2 apps so far. Therefore, there are 7 apps left in his phone that he wants to delete. However, after deleting 3 more apps, there will be 4 apps left in his phone. So, the final answer is 4.
"Response:  We have to find out how many apps are there in total and then calculate the percentage of free apps among them.  So, let's break down the given information as follows:

* Number of apps in Dev's phone = 21
* Total number of apps = 89 (as per the question)
* Number of free apps = 24 (as per the question)

Now, we need to calculate the percentage of free apps among all apps. To do this, we can use the following formula:
Percentage of free apps = (Number of free apps / Total number of apps) x 100

Substituting the values, we get:
Percentage of free apps = (24 / 89) x 100 = 27.3%

So, there are approximately 27.3% free apps among the total number of apps in Dev's phone."
Response:  Dev has Rs. 150 in his phone and he spends Rs. 71 on an app. He is left with Rs. 79. After some time, he gets Rs. 14 as change. So, the total amount of money that Devi has after getting change is Rs. 93 (Rs. 79 + Rs. 14).
Response:  We have 16 apps and 77 files in total. If we delete 5 apps and 23 files, then the remaining number of apps will be 16 - 5 = 11, and the remaining number of files will be 77 - 23 = 54. So, the final count of apps after deleting 5 apps and 23 files is 11, and the final count of files after deleting 5 apps and 23 files is 54.
Response:  We have 17 apps and 21 files in total. If we delete 3 apps and 7 files, then we will have 10 apps and 14 files left. So, the number of apps that are not deleted is 10 - 3 = 7, and the number of files that are not deleted is 14 - 7 = 7. Therefore, out of all the apps and files, 7 apps and 7 files are remaining after deletion.
Response:  We have 15 apps installed on the phone and we want to delete 7 of them. So, the total number of apps left after deleting 7 is 15 - 7 = 8. Now, out of these 8 apps, 3 are banking apps, so the total number of non-banking apps left is 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 non-banking apps remaining in the phone after deleting 7 apps.
Response:  We have 19 files of size 10 MB each and we delete 6 files leaving us with 13 files. Then, we add 15 new files of size 20 MB each, so the total file size is now 13 x 10 = 130 MB + 15 x 20 = 300 MB = 430 MB. Therefore, the final file size after adding and deleting files is 430 MB.
Response:  Dev has 17 apps installed on his phone and he wants to know how many of them are still active after 18 months. So, we need to find out which apps have been used in the last 18 months.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of Active Apps = Total Number of Apps - Number of Inactive Apps Now, let's calculate the number of inactive apps using the information provided in the question: Number of Inactive Apps = Total Number of Apps x Time Period (in months) / Lifespan of an App For example, if an app has a lifespan of 6 months, then the number of inactive apps would be: Number of Inactive Apps = 17 x 18 / 6 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 apps that are no longer active after 18 months.
Response:  We have 59 files with a total size of 15TB and we want to reduce it to 12TB. So, we need to delete some files. Now, let's assume that each file takes up approximately 30MB of space on average (this is just an estimate). Therefore, to reduce the overall size of the files from 15TB to 12TB, we would need to delete around 4,500 files (12TB / 30MB per file = 45,000 files). However, since we cannot delete individual files directly in DevC++, we will need to use another application or tool to do so.
"Response:  We have 24 files with a total size of 13TB and we want to compress them into 17TB.  To do this, we can use an average compression ratio of 2:1 (i.e., for every two original files, one compressed file will be produced).  So, the number of compressed files will be:

Compressed files = Original files x Compression ratio
= 24 x 2/1 = 48

Now, let's calculate the size of each compressed file:

Size of each compressed file = Size of original file / Compression ratio
= 13TB / 2 = 6.5TB

So, we will need approximately 6.5TB of storage space to store all the compressed files."
Response:  We have 24 apps installed on Dev's phone and we want to move 5 of them to the SD card. So, the total number of apps left on the phone after moving 5 is 24 - 5 = 19. Now, out of these 19 apps, 3 are backup files, so the remaining number of apps is 19 - 3 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 apps left on the phone after moving 5 to the SD card.
Response:  We have 11 files in total and we want to delete 3 of them. So, the remaining files are 8 (11 - 3). Now, out of these 8 files, we want to move 2 to another folder. So, the number of files left after moving 2 is 6 (8 - 2). Finally, there are 24 files in total including the ones moved to another folder. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  We have to find out how many cards Neil has and how many cards he can keep.  From the question, we know that Neil has 242 cards in total and he wants to keep 136 of them. So, we need to calculate how many cards he can discard. To do this, we divide the number of cards he wants to keep (136) by the total number of cards he has (242): 136 / 242 = 0.55 or approximately 55 cards. Therefore, Neil can discard around 55 cards.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cards are there in total and then calculate the percentage of cards that are missing.  So, let's first calculate the total number of cards:

301 cards x 154 cards = 45,740 cards

Now, we need to find out how many cards are missing:

45,740 cards - 154 cards = 45,586 cards

So, the percentage of missing cards is:

(154/45,740) x 100% = 3.42%

Therefore, approximately 3.42% of the total number of cards are missing."
Response:  We have 528 cards in total and we want to know how many cards are left after taking out 11 cards from the deck of size 11 x 528 = 5696 cards. So, there are 5696 - 11 = 5685 cards left in the deck.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cards Neil has in total and then calculate the percentage of Jeff's cards that he has.  So, let's start with the information given in the question:
Neil has 566 cards in his collection.
Jeff has 234 cards in his collection.
Now, we need to find out what percentage of Jeff's cards Neil has. To do this, we can use the formula:
Percentage = (Number of Neil's cards / Total number of cards) x 100
Plugging in the values, we get:
Percentage = (566 / 800) x 100 = 71.25%
So, Neil has 71.25% of Jeff's cards."
Response:  We have 309 base ball cards and 356 card maker. So, we can make 356 x 10 = 3560 base ball cards with these materials. Now, we need to find out how many base ball cards are left after making 415 base ball cards. Therefore, we subtract 415 from 3560, which gives us 3145 remaining base ball cards. Finally, we divide 10 by 3145, which gives us approximately 327 base ball cards per batch of 10 cards.
Response:  We have been given two numbers: 246 and 404.  We need to find out how many times 246 goes into 404. To do this, we divide 404 by 246: 404 / 246 = 1.6375. So, 246 goes into 404 exactly 1.6375 times.
Response:  We have 573 cards in total and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 143 cards (573 / 4 = 143). Now, there are 195 cards left, which means that John has already taken 195 cards (195 - 143 = 52). Therefore, Jeff has 210 cards left (210 - 52 = 158).
"Response:  We have been given four information in the question: 

1. There are 438 balls in total.
2. Out of these, 181 balls are blue and 10 balls are red.
3. Among the blue balls, there are 55 balls that are smaller than the others.
4. The remaining 263 balls are bigger than the smaller blue balls.

Now, let's calculate the number of big blue balls:

Big blue balls = Total blue balls - Small blue balls = 438 - 55 = 383

So, out of the 383 big blue balls, how many are bigger than the red ball?

Answer: 383 - 10 = 373

Therefore, there are 373 big blue balls that are bigger than the red ball."
"Response:  We have been given two sets of cards:  set A has 239 base ball cards and 38 special cards; set B has 10 basic card packs with 11 each.  Now we need to find out how many special cards Neil has in total.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Total number of special cards = Number of basic card packs x Number of special cards per pack.  In this case, there are 38 special cards in set A, so if we divide it by 38, we get the total number of special cards Neil has:  Total number of special cards = 38 / 38 = 1. Therefore, Neil has one special card."
"Response:  If Pako can eat 19 cups of rice in one sitting and he eats 35 cups more than him, then the total amount of rice that Pako will eat is:

19 + (35 - 19) = 35 cups of rice

So, Pako will eat 35 cups of rice in total."
Response:  We know that Pakistani cuisine is famous for its rich flavors and spices. So, if we have to eat 28 tonnes of kukri (a type of Nepali dish) in one meal, it would be quite challenging. However, let's assume that we can manage somehow. Now, we need to calculate how many plates of kukri we would need to serve 28 tonnes of food. To do this, we will use the following formula: Number of plates = Total amount of food / Amount of food per plate For example, if we want to divide 100 kg of rice among 5 people, we would need 20 plates of rice (100 kg / 5 kg per plate). In our case, we are dealing with 28 tonnes of kukri, which is equivalent to approximately 28,000 kilograms or 28 million grams. If we assume that each plate of kukri contains about 500 grams (which is a rough estimate), then we would need: Number of plates = 28,000,000 g / 500 g per plate = 56,000 plates of kukri Therefore, if we had to eat 28 tonnes of kukri in one meal, we would need around 56,000 plates of kukri! This is an extremely large number, and I hope you understand why I said earlier that it would be quite challenging to achieve.
Response:  We know that Pako has 40 kg of kukri and he wants to sell it for Rs. 37 per kg. So, if he sells all his kukri at this price, he will get Rs. 1580 (40 kg x Rs. 37/kg). Now, he buys 37 kg of kukri from Odo at Rs. 40 per kg. So, he spends Rs. 1460 (37 kg x Rs. 40/kg) on buying new kukri. Therefore, Pako makes a profit of Rs. 120 (Rs. 1580 - Rs. 1460).
Response:  We have 25 coins in total and we need to distribute them among 3 friends such that each friend gets an equal number of coins. So, we will divide 25 coins into 3 parts. Each part will contain 8 coins ( since there are 3 friends). Now, let's calculate how many coins each friend will get. Friend 1 will get 8 coins x 3 = 24 coins. Friend 2 will get 8 coins x 3 = 24 coins. And Friend 3 will get 8 coins x 3 = 24 coins. Therefore, the answer is 24 coins for each friend.
Response:  We know that Pako has 13 kg of rice to sell and he wants to buy 36 kg of rice. So, we need to find out how many bags of 5 kg each Pako can buy with the money he has.  First, let's convert the amount of rice in terms of bags: 13 kg / 5 kg/bag = 2.6 bags  Now, let's see how much money Pako has left after buying 36 kg of rice: 2.6 bags x 36 kg/bag = Rs 87.60 (approximately) Therefore, Pako has Rs 87.60 left after buying 36 kg of rice.
Response:  We know that Pako has 40 kg of rice and he wants to distribute it equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get 8 kg of rice (40/5 = 8). Now, let's see how much rice Pako will have left after distributing it to his friends. 8 kg + 8 kg = 16 kg (Pako's remaining rice). Therefore, Pako will have 16 kg of rice left after distributing it to his friends.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water Paku can drink in total and then how much water is left after he drank 14 cups. So, let's calculate it as follows:
Paku can drink 17 cups of water at once, so he has drunk 17 x 1 = 17 cups of water already. Now, he wants to drink 13 more cups of water, which means he will have drunk a total of 17 + 13 = 30 cups of water. Since he started with 14 cups of water, there are 30 - 14 = 16 cups of water left after he finished drinking."
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice Pakistani can eat in total and then divide it among his friends. So, firstly we will calculate the number of cups of rice that Pakistani can eat. According to the question, he can eat 12 cups of rice at one time. Now, let's assume that he eats 3 times a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Therefore, he will eat 12 x 3 = 36 cups of rice per day. Now, we need to calculate the total number of days that Pakistani has been alive. According to the question, he is 70 years old, which means he has been alive for 70 x 365 = 25550 days. Now, we will divide the total number of cups of rice that Pakistani can eat per day by the total number of days he has been alive to get the average number of cups of rice he eats per day. Average number of cups of rice eaten per day = Total number of cups of rice that Pakistani can eat per day / Total number of days he has been alive = 36 cups/day / 25550 days = 0.14 cups/day On an average, Pakistani eats 0.14 cups of rice per day. Now, let's find out how much rice he can give to each of his 16 friends. To do this, we will divide the total number of cups of rice that Pakistani can eat per day by the number of friends he wants to share with. Number of cups of rice Pakistani can give to each friend = Total number of cups of rice that Pakistani can eat per day / Number of friends he wants to share with = 0.14 cups/day / 16 friends = 0.0086 cups/friend On an average, Pakistani can give approximately 0.0086 cups of rice to each of his 16 friends.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice and how much weight of sugar are required for making 22 portions of kheer with 15 tonnes of milk.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of cups of rice needed for each portion of kheer. As per the question, there are 22 portions of kheer in total, so we can divide the total amount of rice (10 kg) by the number of portions (22). This gives us approximately 466 grams of rice per portion. Now, let's move on to calculating the weight of sugar required for each portion of kheer. As per the question, there are 75 kilograms of sugar available, which means that we can use approximately 308 grams of sugar per portion of kheer (based on the calculation above). Therefore, the total weight of sugar required for all 22 portions of kheer is approximately 6940 grams (308 grams x 22 portions). So, to make 22 portions of kheer with 15 tonnes of milk, we would require approximately 466 grams of rice and 6940 grams of sugar.
Response:  Pako has eaten 9 small cakes and 6 sweetmeats. He has also drunk 36 ml of milk. To find out how much he has left after drinking milk, we need to subtract 36 ml from the total amount of food he had. So, the number of small cakes and sweetmeats left with Pako is:  Number of small cakes = Total number of small cakes - Amount of milk drunk = 9 - 36 = 0 Small cakes left with Pako Number of sweetmeats = Total number of sweetmeats - Amount of milk drunk = 6 - 36 = 0 Sweetmeats left with Pako Therefore, there are no small cakes or sweetmeats left with Pako.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice and lentils are required for making 37 gots of mithai and 11 gots of namkeen.  Firstly, we need to convert the quantity of mithai and namkeen from grams to cups.  For this, we will use the conversion factor of 100 grams = 4 cups (approximately). So, 37 gots of mithai is equal to 37 x 4 = 148 cups of mithai. Similarly, 11 gots of namkeen is equal to 11 x 4 = 44 cups of namkeen. Now, let's calculate the total amount of water required for cooking these quantities of rice and lentils. To do this, we will use the formula: Water requirement = (rice + lentils) x Cooking time x Conversion factor. In this case, the cooking time is 5 minutes, so the water requirement would be: Water requirement = (148 cups of mithai + 44 cups of namkeen) x 5 minutes x 2 liters/cup = 1960 milliliters. Therefore, the answer is 1960 milliliters.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of each candy are there in total.  So, we will start with the first part of the question: ""पाको आठटा मीठा कुकीज आ"" which means ""How many pieces of Mithai (candy) does Paako have?""  Now, let's see what the options are:  A - 20 pieces B - 34 pieces C - 56 pieces D - 80 pieces E - 104 pieces Since there are five options, we will choose one option randomly and mark it as our answer.  So, our answer is: Option B - 34 pieces of Mithai.  Next, we come to the second part of the question: ""ओ २० टा मीठ कुकीज आ ३४ टा नमहर कुकीज खालक"". Which means ""Out of 20 pieces of Mithai, how many are Halwa (a type of sweet dish)?"" Again, let's see the options: A - 7 pieces B - 14 pieces C - 21 pieces D - 28 pieces E - 35 pieces Since there are five options, we will choose one option randomly and mark it as our answer.

Which means ""How much money did Paako spend on buying these candies and sweets?"" Now, let's see the options: A - Rs. 100 B - Rs. 200 C - Rs. 300 D - Rs. 400 E - Rs. 500 Since there are five options, we will choose one option randomly and mark it as our answer.  So, our answer is: Option B - Rs. 200. Therefore, our final answer is: Option B for the first part, Option C for"
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 36 liters.  To do this, we need to know the volume of one cup of water.  In Nepal, one cup of water is equal to 200 milliliters (mL). So, if we want to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 36 liters, we can divide 36 liters by 200 mL per cup.  Therefore, the number of cups of water required to fill up 36 liters is: 36 liters / 200 mL per cup = 180 cups  Since there are 8 cups in one liter, we can convert 180 cups to liters as follows: 180 cups x 8 mL/cup = 1440 mL  Finally, we can convert 1440 mL from milliliters to liters as follows: 1440 mL / 1000 mL = 1.44 liters  Therefore, the answer to the question is: 36 liters = 180 cups = 1440 mL = 1.44 liters

"Response:  Pakko has 41 cups of rice and wants to share it equally among his friends. He has 9 friends who will take 18 cups each. So, how many cups of rice will be left with Pakko after he shares it with his friends?

Answer: 23 cups (41 - 9 x 18 = 23)"
Response:  We have to distribute 30 cups of rice among 5 friends in such a way that each friend gets an equal amount (i.e., 6 cups). So, we will give 6 cups of rice to each of the 5 friends. Now, let's see how many cups of rice are left after distributing 23 cups among 3 friends. Since there are 3 friends and they get 23 cups of rice each, the total number of cups of rice distributed is 23 x 3 = 69 cups. Therefore, there are 69 - 6 = 63 cups of rice left.
Response:  We know that Pako has eaten 97 pieces of sweet candy and 34 pieces of sour candy. So, the total number of candies he has eaten is: 97 + 34 = 131 candies. Now, we are asked how many more mithai (sweet) candies Pako will eat if he continues to eat at this rate for 56 more minutes. To find out, we need to multiply the number of minutes by the number of candies he eats per minute: 56 x 131 = 7260 candies. Therefore, Pako will eat an additional 7260 - 131 = 7129 candies if he continues to eat at this rate for 56 more minutes.
Response:  We know that Pako has eaten 26 sweet cakes and 17 salty cakes. If he had eaten 9 more sweet cakes, then he would have eaten a total of 35 sweet cakes. So, the number of sweet cakes left with him after eating 9 more is 35 - 26 = 9. Similarly, if he had eaten 4 more salty cakes, then he would have eaten a total of 17 + 4 = 21 salty cakes. So, the number of salty cakes left with him after eating 4 more is 17 - 17 = 0. Therefore, the total number of cakes left with Pako after eating 9 sweet cakes and 4 salty cakes is 9 + 0 = 9.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of milk are required to make 39 g of paneer and how much time it will take to prepare 6 cups of namkeen mixture.  Firstly, we need to convert grams to cups of milk.  To do this, we can use the conversion factor of 1 cup = 240 ml (milliliters). So, 39 g of paneer is equal to 0.157 cups of milk (39/240). Now, let's move on to finding out how long it will take to prepare 6 cups of namkeen mixture. According to the question, it takes 23 minutes to prepare 1 cup of namkeen mixture. Therefore, it will take 23 x 6 = 138 minutes to prepare 6 cups of namkeen mixture. Finally, we need to calculate how much time it will take to cook the paneer in the mixture. As per the question, it takes 10 minutes to cook the paneer in the mixture. Therefore, the total time required to prepare all six cups of namkeen mixture with paneer will be 138 + 10 = 148 minutes.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of rice are required to make 40 kg of rice flour and then calculate how much water is needed for that amount of rice flour.

Firstly, we need to convert the weight of rice from kilograms (kg) to grams (g). There are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so:

40 kg x 1000 g/kg = 40,000 g

Now, we know that 1 cup of rice flour requires 125 g of water. So, to make 40 kg of rice flour, we can use this formula:

Number of cups = Total weight of rice / Weight of 1 cup of rice flour

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of cups = 40,000 g / 125 g/cup = 320 cups

Therefore, there are approximately 320 cups of rice flour required to make 40 kg of rice flour."
Response:  Gwen's birthday is on July 7th and she received $7 as gift money from her parents. She spent $5 of it on something she wanted but didn't need. So, the remaining amount of money that Ollie has with him is $2.
Response:  Genie can grant any wish as per his power. So, if he wants to give $8000 to someone on his birthday, he can simply wave his hand and make it happen. But why would he want to give such a large amount of money to just one person? It doesn't make sense for him to do so. Moreover, giving away such a huge sum of money without any reason or purpose goes against the very nature of genie-hood. As a genie, Genie's primary duty is to serve and help those who seek his assistance, but not to indulge in random acts of charity. Therefore, I believe that Genie did not give anyone $8000 on his birthday.
Response:  Gwenak Janmadin is celebrating his birthday today and has received $20 from each of his three friends - Babuji, Omkara, and Charu. He spent $3 on something he wanted but didn't need. So, he now has $17 left with him. Now, let's calculate how much money Gwenak has after spending $3:  $20 (received from friends) - $3 (spent) = $17 (money left with Gwenak)
"Response: 
Gwen's birthday is on August 8th and she received $8 from her father as pocket money. She spent $4 of it on arcade games with Babuji. So, Gwen has $4 left in her pocket. Now, let's calculate how much money Gwen's father gave to each of them (Gwen and Babuji). Since Gwen received $8 and spent $4, her father gave her $8 - $4 = $4. Similarly, since Babuji spent $4, his father gave him $8 - $4 = $4. Therefore, Gwen's father gave $4 to Gwen and $4 to Babuji."
"Response: 
Gwen's father gave her $300 for her birthday. Gwen spent $40 of it on something. So, she has $260 left. Now, let's calculate how much money each of Gwen and her father have after they split the remaining amount equally.
Gwen's father has $260 / 2 = $130.
Gwen has $260 - $40 = $220."

"Response:  Josh has collected 16 tons of garbage and wants to know how much it weighs in gold mohars. If each ton is equal to 800 mohars (as per the given information), then the weight of 16 tons of garbage in gold mohars would be:

16 tons x 800 mohars/ton = 12,800 mohars
Now, Josh wants to know how many bags of 5 kg each he can fill with this amount of gold mohars. To do this, we need to divide the total weight of gold mohars by the weight of one bag:

12,800 mohars / 5 kg/bag = 2560 bags
So, Josh can fill 2560 bags of 5 kg each with the weight of gold mohars that his garbage collection amounts to."
Response:  Josh has 7 bags of gumdrops and he wants to share them equally among his 8 friends. So, each friend will get 10 gumdrops (7 x 10 = 70). Now, there are 10 gumdrops left over after sharing them with the friends, so Josh has 30 gumdrops remaining (10 - 70 = 30).
Response:  Josh has 21 goblins in his collection and he wants to know how many goblins are left after giving 7 of them away. So, if he gives 7 goblins away, then there will be 21 - 7 = 14 goblins left in his collection.

Response:  Josh has 22 goblins in his collection and Jack has 20 goblins to sell. So, if Josh buys all of Jack's goblins, he will have 42 goblins (22 + 20).
Response:  Josh has 11 gots of gold coins and he wants to distribute them equally among his 19 friends. Since each friend gets 4 gots (as per the question), we need to divide 11 gots by 19 friends, which gives us 0.58 gots per friend. So, Josh will have 0.58 x 11 = 6.22 gots left after distributing all the gold coins among his friends.
Response:  Josh has 22 goblars in his collection and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 of his friends. So, each friend will get 4 goblars (22 / 5 = 4). Now, out of these 4 goblars, 3 are big ones (4 x 3 = 12) and 1 is small one (4 - 1 = 3). Therefore, there are 12 big goblars and 3 small goblars left after distribution.
"Response:  Josh has 15 marbles in his collection and he wants to distribute them equally among 9 friends. So, each friend will get 1-1/9 = 0.111 marbles. Now, there are 23 marbles left, so each of the remaining 2 friends will get 0.23 x 2 = 0.46 marbles. Therefore, the final distribution is: Josh - 0 marbles; Friends 1-9 - 0.111 marbles each; Friends 10-12 - 0.46 marbles each."
Response:  Josh has three bulbs in his collection and he wants to give five of them as gifts. He has six goats that can carry one bulb each. How many bulbs will be left with Josh after giving away five bulbs as gifts? Solution:  After giving away five bulbs as gifts, Josh will have three bulbs left (since he had three bulbs initially). So, there will be three bulbs left with Josh.
Response:  Marko has 4 pounds of steak and Okar has 19 pounds of steak. If Okar gives half of his steak to his father, how much steak will he have left?  So, Okar will have 9.5 pounds (19 - 10 = 9.5) of steak left after giving half to his father.
Response:  Marko has a weight of 80 kg and his father has a weight of 60 kg. If Marko wants to have the same BMI as his father, he needs to weigh 49 kg (60/2 = 30). So, Marko's current weight is 80 - 49 = 31 kg more than his ideal weight.
Response:  Marko has 20 pounds of meat and his father has 17 pounds of meat. So, if Marko gives half of his meat to his father, how much meat will he have left? Marko will have 10 pounds (half of 20) of meat left.
"Response:  We know that Marko has 8 pounds of meat and he wants to make 32 pounds of sausages. So, we need to calculate how many times he can divide the original weight into smaller pieces to get the desired weight.

Let's assume each piece of sausage weighs x pounds. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

x = 8 / n

where n is the number of times Marko divides the original weight (8 pounds) into smaller pieces.

Now, we want to find out what value of x will give us 32 pounds of sausages. So, we substitute n = 4 (since Marko wants to make 4 batches of sausages) into the above equation:

x = 8 / 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2 pounds per piece of sausage

Therefore, Marko needs to divide the original weight of meat (8 pounds) into 4 equal parts or pieces of sausage to make 32 pounds of sausages."
Response:  We know that Marko had 25 kilograms of sugar and gave 9 pounds to his father. So, he has 16 kilograms of sugar left (25 - 9 = 16). Now, we are asked how much sugar Marko has in total after giving 3 pounds to his brother. To find this out, we need to convert 3 pounds to kilograms. There are 0.453592 kilograms in 1 pound, so 3 pounds is equal to 3 x 0.453592 = 1.360788 kilograms. Therefore, Marko has 16 + 1.360788 = 17.360788 kilograms of sugar in total after giving some to his brother.
Response:  We have to find out how many pound of Marko's father's strawberries are left after Marko took 36 pounds and then his father gave him another 12 pounds. So, we need to calculate the total amount of strawberries that Marko got from his father. Firstly, Marko took 36 pounds of strawberries, so he got 36 x 0.45 = 15.7 pounds of strawberries (as each pound is equal to 0.45 kg). Then, his father gave him another 12 pounds of strawberries, so he got an additional 12 x 0.45 = 5.48 pounds of strawberries (as each pound is equal to 0.45 kg). Therefore, in total, Marko got 15.7 + 5.48 = 21.18 pounds of strawberries from his father.
Response:  Marko has 22 pounds of strawberries and wants to share them equally among his three friends. Each friend will get how many pounds of strawberries?  We know that Marko has 30 pounds of strawberries in total, so he has 7 pounds left after sharing with his friends. How much does each friend get if Marko gives 36 pounds of strawberries altogether?  So, each friend gets 7/3 = 2 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  Marko has 15 pounds of steak and wants to divide it equally among his three friends. Each friend will get 5 pounds of steak. Now, if Dunu got 37 pounds of steak instead of 5 pounds, how much would each of Marko's friends get?
Response:  Marko has 30 pounds of meat and wants to divide it equally among his three sons. Each son will get 10 pounds of meat (30/3 = 10). Now, each son has 10 pounds of meat, and they want to distribute it equally among themselves. So, each son will get 3.33 pounds of meat (10/3 = 3.33). Therefore, the weight of meat that each son will get is 3.33 pounds.
Response:  Marko has 10 pounds of steak and wants to divide it equally among his three children. Each child will get 3 pounds of steak. Now, let's calculate how much weight each child will lose if they eat 26 pounds of steak in total.  We know that each child will eat 3 pounds of steak, so they will lose 26 / 3 = 8.67 pounds.
Response:  Marko has 11 pounds of steak and he wants to divide it equally among his three friends. So, each friend will get 3.67 pounds of steak (11 / 3 = 3.67). Now, let's calculate how much steak Dunno will get if Marko gives him half of what he got. Half of 3.67 pounds is 1.84 pounds (3.67 / 2 = 1.84). Therefore, Marko's stake is 1.84 pounds.
"Response:  We have to find out how many children are in the bus and then calculate the total number of children who got off the bus.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - ""बसमे दूटा बच्चा सवार छल"".  There are 10 children in the bus.  Now, we need to find out how many children got off the bus.  The second part of the question is ""बस स्टॉप पर किछु आओर बच्चा बस मे चढ़ल"".  Out of these 10 children, 3 children got off the bus.  Therefore, the final answer is 7 (10 - 3)."
Response:  We have 26 children in total and we need to distribute them equally among 3 buses. So, each bus will have 26/3 = 8 children. Now, there are already 38 children on one of the buses, so we need to subtract that number from the total number of children. Therefore, the remaining number of children who don't have a bus is 26 - 38 = -12.
Response:  We have 41 babies in the bus and we need to distribute them equally among 5 stops. So, each stop will get 8 babies (41/5 = 8). Now, let's assume that there are 3 stops where all the babies will be distributed equally. So, the number of babies at each stop is 8 x 3 = 24 babies. Therefore, the answer is 24 babies.
Response:  We have 43 children in total and 21 of them are boys. So, the number of girls is 43 - 21 = 22. Now, we need to find out how many girls are there in the bus stop. Since 21 boys are already there, the remaining 22 girls will also be there. Therefore, the total number of children at the bus stop is 22 + 21 = 43.
Response:  We have 41 children in the bus and we need to find out how many are sitting in each row. Since there are 18 rows in total, let's divide 41 by 18 to get the number of children sitting in each row. So, each row has 2.375 children ( rounded off to 2 children). Now, since there are 2 children in each row, and there are 18 rows in total, we can conclude that there are 36 children (2 x 18 = 36) sitting in the bus.
"Response:  We have 21 children in total and we need to distribute them equally among 5 buses. So, each bus will have 4 children (21/5 = 4). Now, let's assume that there are already 10 children in one bus, so we need to add 3 more children to it (4 - 10 = 3). Therefore, the number of children in the first bus is 10 + 3 = 13. Similarly, we can calculate the number of children in each of the remaining 4 buses as follows: Bus 2: 21 - 10 = 11; Bus 3: 21 - 9 = 12; Bus 4: 21 - 8 = 13; Bus 5: 21 - 7 = 14. Thus, the total number of children in all 5 buses is 13 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 65."
Response:  We have 63 children in total and we need to distribute them equally among 5 buses. So, each bus will have 12 children (63/5 = 12). Now, there are already 14 children inside one of the buses, so we can add another 8 children to that bus (14 + 8 = 22). Therefore, the number of children outside the bus is 22 - 14 = 8.
Response:  We have 36 children in total and we need to distribute them equally among 68 buses. So, each bus will have 68/36 = 1.94 children. Since there are 12 children left over after distributing them equally among all buses, they will be distributed among the remaining 68 buses in proportion to their capacity. Therefore, each bus will get 12/68 = 0.175 children. Now, let's calculate how many buses will have at least one child. There are 68 buses in total, so the number of buses with at least one child is 68 - (0.175 x 68) = 68 - 11.6 = 56.4 buses.
Response:  We have 22 children in Bus A and 40 children in Bus B. If we add both these numbers, we get 62 children. Now, out of these 62 children, 20 children got off at Stop C. So, the number of children left in Bus B after stopping at Stop C is 40 - 20 = 20 children. Therefore, there are 20 children in Bus B who will reach their destination.
Response:  We have 28 children in the bus and 82 children get off the bus. So, the total number of children left inside the bus is 82 - 28 = 54. Now, we are asked how many children will go out of the bus. Since each child can go out only once, the number of children who will go out of the bus is equal to the total number of children inside the bus (54) minus the number of children already got off the bus (82). Therefore, the answer is 54 - 82 = -28.
Response:  We have 23 children in one bus and 24 children in another bus. If we add both the numbers, we get 47 children in total. So, there are 47 children in both buses combined.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 51 can be divided into 133. So we need to divide 51 by 133. When we divide 51 by 133, we get 0 with remainder 42. Therefore, the number of times 51 can be divided into 133 is 42.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 54 tonnes of rice can be packed in 13 tons of bags. To do this, we need to divide 54 by 13. When we divide 54 by 13, we get 4. So, 54 tonnes of rice can be packed in 4 x 13 = 52 bags. Therefore, the answer is 52.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice Becker can make from 145 tonnes of rice.  Since each bag of rice weighs approximately 20 kg, we need to divide the total weight of rice by the weight of one bag of rice. So, 145 tonnes / 20 kg = 7250 bags of rice. Now, since there are 7250 bags of rice and Becker has already made 81 bags (as mentioned in the question), then the remaining number of bags that Becker can make is 7250 - 81 = 7169 bags.
"Response:  We have to buy 155 kg of rice at Rs. 140 per kg. So, the total cost of buying 155 kg of rice is:

Cost = Number of kg x Price per kg
= 155 kg x Rs. 140 per kg
= Rs. 21,750 (approximately)

So, if we buy 155 kg of rice and sell it at Rs. 180 per kg, our profit would be:

Profit = Selling price - Cost
= Rs. 180 per kg x Number of kg sold
- Rs. 21,750 (cost of buying 155 kg of rice)

To find out how much profit we can make selling 155 kg of rice, we need to subtract the cost of buying the rice from the selling price:

Profit = Rs. 180 per kg x Number of kg sold - Rs. 21,750
= Rs. 180 x 155 kg - Rs. 21,750
= Rs. 26,975 (approximately)

Therefore, if you buy 155 kg of rice at Rs. 140 per kg and sell it at Rs. 180 per kg, your approximate profit would be Rs. 26,975."
"Response:  The bekar has 121 kg of rice and wants to sell it for Rs. 105 per kg. To calculate how many kgs he can buy with the money he will get from selling his rice, we need to divide the amount he will get from selling his rice by the price he is getting per kg. So, 

Amount he will get from selling his rice = 121 kg x Rs. 105/kg = Rs. 12675 (approximately)
Now, let's see how much rice he can buy with this amount.  Number of kgs of rice he can buy = Amount he will get from selling his rice / Price he is paying per kg = Rs. 12675 / Rs. 105/kg = approximately 120 kgs.
So, the bekar still has around 120 kgs of rice left after selling 121 kgs."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money Becker has spent on buying new keys for his bike. According to the question, he has bought 13 new keys and each key costs Rs 91. So, the total amount he has spent is:

13 x 91 = Rs 1123

Now, let's find out how much money Becker has saved after selling his old keys. According to the question, he has sold 91 keys and each key fetched him Rs 50. So, the total amount of money he has earned from selling his old keys is:

91 x 50 = Rs 4550

Now, let's calculate the difference between the amount Becker has spent (Rs 1123) and the amount he has earned (Rs 4550). The difference is:

Rs 4550 - Rs 1123 = Rs 3427

Therefore, Becker has saved Rs 3427 by buying new keys for his bike."
"Response: 
The bekar has 170 kg of rice and wants to sell it for Rs 31 per kilogram. He has already sold 78 kg of rice at this price. Now he wants to know how much he will get if he sells the remaining 92 kg of rice at the same price.
So, the calculation is:
Total amount earned from selling 78 kg of rice = 78 x Rs 31/kg = Rs 2564
Amount left after selling 78 kg of rice = Remaining weight of rice (92 kg) - Amount earned from selling 78 kg of rice = 92 kg - Rs 2564 = Rs 2308
Therefore, if the bekar sells the remaining 92 kg of rice at the same price of Rs 31/kg, he will get Rs 2308."
Response:  We know that 110 kg of beef was sold and 75 tonnes were bought. So, we have to find out how much is left after buying 76 tonnes. To do this, we need to subtract the amount bought from the total amount available. Therefore, the remaining quantity of beef = Total quantity - Amount bought = 110 kg - 75 tonnes = 35 kg.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 71 can be divided into 144 and also how many times 111 can be divided into 71.

Firstly, we will divide 144 by 71:

144 / 71 = 2

So, Becker can make 2 bags of 71 tonnes each.

Now, let's see how many times 111 can be divided into 71:

111 / 71 = 1.63

So, Becker can make approximately 1.63 bags of 71 tonnes each using 111 tonnes of coal."
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of 10 tonnes each can be made from 90 tonnes of sugar.  To do this, we need to divide 90 tonnes by 10 tonnes per packet.  So, the number of packets that can be made is: 90 tonnes / 10 tonnes/packet = 9 packets. Therefore, 9 packets of 10 tonnes each can be made from 90 tonnes of sugar.
"Response:  We have to find out how many posts can be made with 1530 rupees.  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each post as follows:

Cost of one post = Total amount / Number of posts
= 1530 / 7
= 216

Now, we know that 216 rupees are enough to make 7 posts. So, the number of posts that can be made with 1530 rupees is:

Number of posts = Total amount / Cost of one post
= 1530 / 216
= 7

Therefore, with 1530 rupees, you can make 7 posts."
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of 126 kg can be filled with 8150 kg of rice. To do this, we need to divide the total weight of rice (8150 kg) by the weight of each packet (126 kg). So, the number of packets that can be filled with 8150 kg of rice is:

Number of packets = Total weight of rice / Weight of each packet
= 8150 kg / 126 kg
= 63 packets
Therefore, 63 packets of 126 kg each can be filled with 8150 kg of rice."
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of beads are required to make 70 tassels and then calculate how many packets of beads will be left after making those tassels.

Firstly, we need to determine the number of beads in each packet. According to the question, there are 19 kinds of beads and each kind has 131 pieces. Therefore, the total number of beads in one packet is:

19 x 131 = 2599

Now, we need to find out how many packets of beads are required to make 70 tassels. To do this, we can divide the total number of beads needed for 70 tassels by the number of beads in each packet:

70 / 2599 = 0.0274 or approximately 27 packets

So, we require approximately 27 packets of beads to make 70 tassels. Now, let's see how many packets of beads will be left after making those tassels:

Total number of beads needed for 70 tassels = 27 packets x 2599 beads/packet = 68,770 beads

After making 70 tassels, we will have used approximately 68,770 beads, which means that we will have approximately 27 - 68,770 = 21 packets of beads left."
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of beads are required to make 157 beads into 147 packets of beads.  To do this, we need to divide 157 by 147.  When we divide 157 by 147, we get:

157 / 147 = 103

So, we require 103 packets of beads to make 157 beads into 147 packets of beads."
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of rice Becker can produce from 54 kg of rice and how much money he will get for selling those packets.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of packets of rice that Becker can produce from 54 kg of rice. To do this, we divide the weight of rice (in kg) by the weight of each packet of rice (which is given as 143 g). So, Number of packets = Total weight of rice / Weight of each packet = 54 kg / 143 g/packet = 370 packets Now, we know that Becker wants to sell these packets of rice at Rs 92 per packet. Therefore, total revenue = Number of packets x Selling price per packet = 370 packets x Rs 92/packet = Rs 33,660 So, Becker will get Rs 33,660 for selling all 370 packets of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice Becker can produce in 48 hours with his current production capacity of 40 bags per day. So, we need to calculate the number of days required for Becker to produce 48 bags of rice.  To do this, we divide the total number of bags of rice he needs to produce (48) by his daily production capacity (40): Number of days = Total number of bags / Daily production capacity = 48 / 40 = 1.2 days Now that we know it takes Becker 1.2 days to produce 48 bags of rice, we can calculate how much time he will take to produce one bag of rice. To do this, we divide the total time taken to produce 48 bags of rice (1.2 days) by the number of bags he needs to produce (48): Time taken to produce one bag = Total time taken / Number of bags produced = 1.2 days / 48 = 0.025 days or 1/4 hour Therefore, Becker will require approximately 1/4 hour to produce one bag of rice.
Response:  We have to sell 80 tonnes of beetle nut and make a profit of Rs 40 per kg. So, we will get a total revenue of Rs 3200 (80 tonnes x Rs 40/kg). Now, let's calculate our cost price. If it takes 16 days to produce 1 tone of beetle nut, then it will take 128 days (16 days x 8) to produce 80 tonnes. Therefore, our total cost will be Rs 12800 (80 tonnes x 128 days). Since we are making a profit of Rs 3200, our net profit will be Rs 9600 (Rs 12800 - Rs 3200).
Response:  If the friend started with Rs. 169 and invested it in Kailash's scheme at an interest rate of 3% per annum, then after 1 year, he would have earned interest of Rs. 4.77 (Rs. 169 x 3%). So, his total amount now would be Rs. 173.77. Now, if he continues to invest every year for next 15 years at the same interest rate, here is how much money he would accumulate: Year    | Interest Earned | Total Amount | 169 | 4.77 | 173.77 | 205.54 | 248.31 | 295.18 | 344.05 | 393.93 | 444.81 | 496.69 | 549.57 | 604.46 | 660.35 | 716.24 | 772.13 | 830.02 | 888.91 | 948.80 | 1008.69 | 1068.58 | 1128.47 | 1188.36 | 1248.25 | 1308.14 | 1368.03 | 1428.92 | 1488.81 | 1548.70 | 1608.59 | 1668.48 | 1728.37 | 1788.26 | 1848.15 | 1908.04 | 1967.93 | 2027.82 | 2087.71 | 2147.60 | 2207.50 | 2267.39 | 2327.28 | 2387.17 | 2447.06 | 2506.9
Response:  The bekar has 173 kg of sugar and wants to sell it for Rs 86 per kilogram. So, he will get Rs 86 x 173 = Rs 14,958 from selling all his sugar. Now, he still has some sugar left with him, which is equal to 173 - 86 = 87 kg. Therefore, the bekar now has 87 kg of sugar left with him.
Response:  The bekar has 99 coins and wants to sell them for 167 rupees. He also wants to buy new coins worth 89 rupees. So, he will have 89 - 99 = (-) 10 coins left after buying the new ones. Therefore, the number of coins the bekar has is 10.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 139 tonnes of sugar at Rs. 145 per tonne. So, the total cost would be:

139 tonnes x Rs. 145 per tonne = Rs. 18,675 (approximately)
Now, let's assume that Becker has already bought 10 tonnes of sugar at Rs. 145 per tonne and wants to sell it for Rs. 139 per tonne. To find out how much profit he can make from selling these 10 tonnes of sugar, we need to subtract the cost price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= Rs. 139 per tonne - Rs. 145 per tonne
= Rs. (-6) per tonne
So, if Becker sells these 10 tonnes of sugar, he will incur a loss of Rs. (-6) per tonne or a total loss of Rs. (-60) (since there are 10 tonnes)."
Response:  We know that 62 + 149 = 211. So, there are 211 keys in total. Now, we need to find out how many keys Becker has left. Since he gave away 144 keys, Becker has 211 - 144 = 67 keys left. Therefore, the answer is 67 keys.
Response:  We know that 81 + 92 = 173. So, if we have to make 46 tonnes of rice, and each tonne is equal to 1000 kg, then we need 46 x 1000 = 46,000 kg of rice. Now, let's calculate how much money Becker will get for selling this amount of rice at Rs 2 per kg.  Total amount of rice sold = 46,000 kg x Rs 2/kg = Rs 92,000. Therefore, Becker will get Rs 92,000 for selling 46,000 kg of rice.
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of rice can be made from 61 kg of uncooked rice and how much money will be left after selling those packets at Rs. 108 per kilogram.

Firstly, we need to calculate the number of packets of rice that can be made from 61 kg of uncooked rice. To do this, we divide the weight of uncooked rice (in kg) by the weight of one packet of rice (which is given as 167 grams).

So, Number of packets = 61 kg / 167 g = 365 packets

Now, let's find out how much money will be left after selling these packets at Rs. 108 per kilogram. We multiply the total number of packets by the selling price per kilogram to get the total amount of money that will be earned.

Total amount of money = Number of packets x Selling price per kilogram
= 365 packets x Rs. 108/kg
= Rs. 39,420

Therefore, after selling all the 365 packets of rice at Rs. 108 per kilogram, there will be Rs. 39,420 left over."
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of rice can be made from 56 kg of uncooked rice. To do this, we need to divide the weight of uncooked rice (in kg) by the weight of one packet of rice (in kg).  Based on the information provided in the question, one packet of rice weighs 104 grams. Therefore, to calculate the number of packets of rice that can be made from 56 kg of uncooked rice, we can use the following formula: Number of packets = Total weight of uncooked rice / Weight of one packet  Number of packets = 56 kg / 104 g = 537 packets  So, approximately 537 packets of rice can be made from 56 kg of uncooked rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 52 can be divided by 84 without leaving any remainder. So we divide 52 by 84 and get 0 with no remainder. Now let's check if 102 can be divided by 94 without leaving any remainder. We divide 102 by 94 and get 1 with no remainder. Therefore, the number of times 52 can be divided by 84 without leaving any remainder is 1, and the number of times 102 can be divided by 94 without leaving any remainder is also 1.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of pasta can be made from 134 kg of rice and 11 tonnes of wheat flour.  Firstly, we need to convert the weight of rice and wheat flour into equivalent weights in terms of pasta.  For example, 1 kg of rice is equal to 200 grams of pasta, so 134 kg of rice is equal to 26800 grams of pasta (134 x 200). Similarly, 1 tone of wheat flour is equal to 1000 kg, so 11 tons of wheat flour is equal to 11000 kg (11 x 1000) of pasta. Now, let's calculate the total number of packets of pasta that can be made using these quantities: Total weight of rice = 26800 grams Total weight of wheat flour = 11000 kg Number of packets of pasta per kilogram of rice = 200 packets/kg Number of packets of pasta per ton of wheat flour = 1000 packets/ton Therefore, the total number of packets of pasta that can be made is: Total number of packets = Total weight of rice / Number of packets per kilogram of rice x Total weight of wheat flour / Number of packets per ton of wheat flour = 26800 / 200 x 11000 / 1000 = 14000 packets So, there are approximately 14000 packets of pasta that can be made from 134 kg of rice and 11 tonnes of wheat flour.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 14 tonnes of rice and how much money will be gained from selling those bags at Rs 97 per kg.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of bags that can be filled with 14 tonnes of rice. To do this, we divide the weight of rice (in tonnes) by the weight of each bag (in kg):

Number of bags = 14 tonnes / 80 kg/bag = 175 bags
Now, let's assume that all these bags are sold at Rs 97 per kg. To calculate the total amount of money gained from selling these bags, we multiply the number of bags by the price per kg:
Total amount of money gained = Number of bags x Price per kg
= 175 bags x Rs 97/kg = Rs 16,275
Therefore, if 14 tonnes of rice are sold in bags of 80 kg each, then the total amount of money gained is Rs 16,275."
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of rice can be made from 43 kg of uncooked rice and how much money will be earned by selling those packets at Rs 154 per packet.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of packets of rice that can be made from 43 kg of uncooked rice. To do this, we divide the weight of uncooked rice (in kg) by the weight of one packet of rice (which is given as 114 g). So, Number of packets = Weight of uncooked rice / Weight of one packet = 43 kg / 114 g = 370 packets Now, let's assume that all these packets are sold at Rs 154 each. Therefore, Total amount earned = Number of packets x Selling price per packet = 370 packets x Rs 154 = Rs 56,900 So, the answer is Rs 56,900.
Response:  We know that Keliki wants to buy 22 tonnes of game meat and he has Rs 140 for it. Now we have to calculate how many games he can buy with this amount.  Game price = Rs 140/tonne So, total cost of 22 tonnes of game meat = 22 x 140 = Rs 3080 Now, let's check if Keliki has enough money to buy all these games. He has Rs 140, which is less than the total cost of the games (Rs 3080). Therefore, Keliki cannot buy all 22 tonnes of game meat with his current budget.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Keliki can score in 64 turns. Since he scores an average of 10 points per turn, we need to calculate how many turns it takes for him to reach his target of 640 points. So, we divide 640 by 10: 640 / 10 = 64 turns. Therefore, Keliki will be able to score 640 points in 64 turns.
Response:  If we have to play 91 games of cricket in one day, and each game lasts for 2 hours, then we will need to start playing at 8 AM and finish at 6 PM. However, if we have to play 92 games of cricket in one day, then we will need to start playing at 7 AM and finish at 5 PM. Therefore, the answer is (B) 7 AM.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 70 tonnes of soni khela can be made using 20 tonnes of nintendos.  So, we need to divide 70 by 20.  When we do this, we get 3.5.  This means that 3.5 times as much soni khela can be made using 20 tonnes of nintendos as there are tonnes of soni khela.
Response:  We have to find out how many sones are there in total and then calculate the percentage of sones that O has given away.  So, let's first count the number of sones:  There are 46 tones in total.  Now, we need to find out how many sones O has given away:  O has given away 132 sones.  Therefore, the percentage of sones that O has given away is: (132/46) x 100 = 287%
Response:  We have to find out how many times Kelik can play Nintendon Game in 80 minutes.  He has played for 31 minutes so far. So, we need to divide 80 by 31 to get the number of times he can play.  Therefore, Kelik can play Nintendo game 26 times (80/31 = 26).
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required to fill up 52 tonnes of sand in a rectangular box with dimensions 38 tonnes x 10 meters long x 5 meters wide.  To do this, we need to calculate the volume of the box first. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is: Volume = Length x Width x Height So, in this case, the length and width of the box are given as 38 tonnes and 10 meters respectively, while the height is 5 meters. Therefore, the volume of the box is: Volume = 38 x 10 x 5 = 1900 cubic meters Now, we know that we want to fill the box with 52 tonnes of sand. Since one tonne is equal to 1000 kilograms, we can convert the volume of sand required to fill the box as follows: Sand requirement = Volume of box / Density of sand (which is approximately 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter) Sand requirement = 1900 cubic meters / 1.6 grams/cubic centimeter = 1174 kg or 1174 tonnes Since we already know that there are 38 tonnes of sand available, we can subtract it from the total amount required to find out how many more tonnes of sand are needed: More sand required = Total sand requirement - Available sand = 1174 - 38 = 836 tonnes Finally, since we cannot have fractional tonnes of sand, we round off the result to the nearest whole number. In this case, we get: Number of extra tonnes of sand required = Roundoff(836 / 100) = 8 tonnes There you go!
"Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are there in total and then calculate the number of blocks that can be made using each block.

Total number of blocks = 97 blocks

Now, let's find out how many blocks can be made from one block:

Number of blocks that can be made from one block = Total number of blocks / Number of blocks in one block
= 97 blocks / 72 blocks (as per the question)
= 13 blocks

So, we can make 13 blocks from one block."
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each task and then add them up.  Task 1: Making 79 blocks of size 10 cm x 10 cm = 790 cubic centimeters (since there are 10 cm x 10 cm in each block).  Task 2: Making 14 blocks of size 5 cm x 5 cm = 70 cubic centimeters (since there are 5 cm x 5 cm in each block).  Total volume of material needed = Volume of task 1 + Volume of task 2 = 790 cubic centimeters + 70 cubic centimeters = 860 cubic centimeters. So, we need 86 blocks of size 5 cm x 5 cm to make the same amount of material as 79 blocks of size 10 cm x 10 cm.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each task and then add them up.  Task 1: Building an L-shaped house requires 58 blocks.  Task 2: To build a wall around the house, we need 27 blocks. So, in total, we require 58 + 27 = 85 blocks.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each of the three situations given in the question.  Situation 1: Randi has 37 blocks and wants to build a block tower that is 33 blocks tall. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of blocks available (37) by the height of the tower (33). So, the number of blocks needed for this situation is: 37 / 33 = 1.1 (approximately 11 blocks) Situation 2: Omi has 33 blocks and wants to build a block tower that is 20 blocks tall. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of blocks available (33) by the height of the tower (20). So, the number of blocks needed for this situation is: 33 / 20 = 1.65 (approximately 17 blocks) Situation 3: The homeowner has 13 blocks and wants to build a wall that is 8 blocks long. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of blocks available (13) by the length of the wall (8). So, the number of blocks needed for this situation is: 13 / 8 = 1.625 (approximately 14 blocks) Therefore, the total number of blocks needed for all three situations is: 11 + 17 + 14 = 48 blocks.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each house and then add them up.  For House 1, we need 86 - 79 = 7 blocks.  For House 2, we need 82 - 79 = 3 blocks. Therefore, the total number of blocks needed is 7 + 3 = 10.
"Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required to cover 36 square meters area with 59 blocks of size 10 cm x 10 cm each.  To do this, we need to calculate the number of blocks needed for one meter length and then multiply it by the width of the area (in meters).

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the number of blocks needed for one meter length:
There are 100 blocks in one square meter, so there are 100 / 10 = 10 blocks per meter.
2. Calculate the total number of blocks needed for the given area:
The area is 36 square meters, so the total number of blocks needed is 36 x 10 = 360 blocks."
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each of the two situations given in the question.  Situation 1: 95 tonnes of sand are needed for construction work at home.  To calculate this, we need to know the volume of one block of sand.  According to the question, one block of sand is equal to 20 tonnes. Therefore, to find out how many blocks of sand are required, we can divide the total quantity of sand needed (95 tonnes) by the volume of one block of sand (20 tonnes): 95 tonnes / 20 tonnes per block = 4.75 blocks  So, we need approximately 4.75 blocks of sand for this situation.  Situation 2: 20 tonnes of sand are required for construction work outside the house.  Again, we need to know the volume of one block of sand to calculate the number of blocks required.  According to the question, one block of sand is equal to 5 tonnes. Therefore, to find out how many blocks of sand are required, we can divide the total quantity of sand needed (20 tonnes) by the volume of one block of sand (5 tonnes): 20 tonnes / 5 tonnes per block = 4 blocks  So, we need approximately 4 blocks of sand for this situation.  Now, let's combine both situations and find out the total number of blocks of sand required: 4.75 + 4 = 8.75 blocks  So, we require approximately 8.75 blocks of sand for both situations combined.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are required for each task and then add them up.  For task 1 (Rainy day), we need 90 blocks.  For task 2 (Home), we need 89 blocks.  For task 3 (Tower), we need 63 blocks.  So, in total, we need 90 + 89 + 63 = 242 blocks.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then we will know which book is missing from the list of 20 books. So, let's count the number of books mentioned in the passage - 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 books. Therefore, one book is missing from the list of 20 books.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 books in the library and we have read 8 of them. So, the number of books left to read is:

13 - 8 = 5

So, there are 5 books left to read in the library."
Response:  We are given that there are 22 different books and 10 different movies.  If we read 12 books, then we have read 12/22 = 54% of the total number of books. Similarly, if we watch 56 movies, then we have watched 56/10 = 560% of the total number of movies. So, the percentage of books and movies that we have read or watched is: Books - 54%, Movies - 560%.
Response:  We have to find out how many books and movies are there in total.  From the given options, we can see that there are 4 different types of books and 17 different types of movies.  So, the total number of books is 4 x 19 = 76. Similarly, the total number of movies is 17 x 7 = 120. Therefore, if you read 19 books and watched 7 movies, you would still have 53 movies left to watch (120 - 7 = 53).
"Response:  We have to find out how many books and movies are there in the series of ""Paagal Mookh School"". From the given options, we can see that there are 16 different books and 14 different movies in this series. So, if we want to know how many books or movies are there in the series, we need to divide the total number of books or movies by 2 (since there are two parts - books and movies). Therefore, the answer is: Books - 16 / 2 = 8; Movies - 14 / 2 = 7."
Response:  We are given that there are 19 books and 61 movies in the school library.  Now, we need to find out how many pairs of book and movie match each other.  To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of pairs = Total number of items / 2 Since there are 19 books and 61 movies, the total number of items is 19 + 61 = 80. So, the number of pairs of book and movie that match each other is: Number of pairs = 80 / 2 = 40 pairs Therefore, there are 40 pairs of book and movie that match each other in the school library.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 books and 11 films.  If we read 13 books, then we will have read all the books (since there are only 10). Therefore, the number of films left to watch is 11 - 10 = 1. So, if we watched 12 films, we would have watched all the films (since there are only 11 left). Thus, the answer is 1.
"Response:  We are given that there are 11 different books and 17 different movies.  We have to find out how many pairs of book and movie match each other.  To do this, we can use combinatorics.  The number of ways to choose one book from 11 options is C(11, 1) = 11.  Similarly, the number of ways to choose one movie from 17 options is C(17, 1) = 17.  Now, let's count the number of pairs of book and movie that match each other.  For each book, there are 16 possible movies that it could be matched with (since there are 17 movies and only one book left).  Therefore, the number of pairs of book and movie that match each other is:

C(11, 16) = 105

So, there are 105 pairs of book and movie that match each other."
"Response:  We are given that there are 14 different books in the ""Pagal Mookh School"" library.  Now, we need to find out how many times each book is mentioned in the passage.  To do this, we can count the number of times each book name appears in the passage and divide it by 14.  For example, if Book A appears 5 times in the passage, then we can say that it has been mentioned 5/14 = 0.36 times.  Similarly, for Book B, if it appears 7 times in the passage, then we can say that it has been mentioned 7/14 = 0.50 times, and so on.  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Books appear in the passage: 0.36, 0.29, 0.26, 0.24, 0.21, 0.18, 0.15, 0.13, 0.11, 0.09, 0.07, 0.05, 0.04 times respectively."
Response:  We know that there are 62 different films and 19 different books.  If we want to watch all the films and read all the books, it will take us 48 hours to finish watching all the films (since each film takes 2 hours to complete) and 34 hours to finish reading all the books ( since each book takes 1 hour to complete). So in total, it will take us 82 hours (48 + 34) to finish both tasks.
Response:  We are given that there are 21 different books and we have to choose one of them to watch a movie based on it. So, the probability of choosing any particular book is 1/21. Now, once we choose a book, there are 7 different movies associated with it, so the probability of choosing any particular movie from those 7 is (7/21) = 35%. Therefore, the overall probability of watching a movie based on a particular book is (1/21) x (35%) = 0.63 or approximately 63%.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different films and 15 different books in the ""Stupid School"" library. If we watch 11 hours of movies and read 40 hours of books, then we have watched 11 x 14 = 154 minutes of movies and read 40 x 15 = 600 minutes of books. So, the number of minutes we spent watching movies is 154, and the number of minutes we spent reading books is 600."
Response:  We know that there are 17 books and 11 films in the school library.  If we read 13 books, then we have read 13 x 17 = 201 books.  Now, if we watch 63 films, then we have watched 63 x 11 = 703 films. So, the total number of books and films that we have consumed is 201 + 703 = 904. Therefore, the answer is 904.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 different books and 6 different films.  If we watch 14 films, then we will have watched 14 x 6 = 84 films in total. Therefore, the number of books we will have read is 10 - 84 = -74 books. So, the answer is -74 books.
Response:  We know that there are 19 films and 16 books.  If we watch 13 films, then we have watched 13 x 19 = 207 films. Similarly, if we read 8 books, then we have read 8 x 16 = 128 books. So, the total number of films and books watched is: 207 + 128 = 335. Therefore, the person has watched a total of 335 films and books.
Response:  Dev has 7 tickets and wants to sell them. Out of these, he sold 3 tickets at Rs. 10 each, which means he earned Rs. 30 (3 x 10). Now, he is left with 4 tickets. He wants to sell these 4 tickets again, but this time he got only Rs. 20 for each ticket (not Rs. 10 as before) due to some reason. So, he earned Rs. 80 from selling all 4 tickets (4 x 20 = 80). Therefore, the total amount of money that Dev earned from selling his 7 tickets is Rs. 110 (30 + 80).
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Dev can buy with his $1200. Since he has already bought 8 tickets, he has $1200 - $8 = $1192 left. Now we need to find out how many tickets he can buy with this amount. There are 14 tickets in total, and each ticket costs $10. So, Dev can buy $\frac {1192}{10} = 119$ tickets. Therefore, if he buys all these tickets, he will get 119 tickets.
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Dev can buy with his $18.  Since he has already bought 5 tickets, he has $18 - 5 = $13 left.  Now, we need to find out how many tickets he can buy with this amount.  There are 11 tickets remaining in total, and each ticket costs $1.  So, Dev can buy $\frac{13}{1}$ = 12 tickets.  Therefore, Dev can buy 12 tickets with his remaining money.
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Dev can buy with his money.  He has Rs 1900 and he wants to buy tickets of Rs 7 each. So, we need to divide Rs 1900 by Rs 7 = 268 tickets. Now, since there are 12 tickets in one booklet, Dev can buy 268 / 12 = 22 booklets of tickets. Therefore, Dev can buy 22 booklets of tickets with his Rs 1900.
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets Dev can buy with Rs. 1300 and how many tickets he will get after selling his old tickets worth Rs. 8000.  So, we need to calculate these two amounts separately.  Firstly, Dev can buy 8 x 8 = 64 tickets with Rs. 1300.  Secondly, after selling his old tickets worth Rs. 8000, he will get 8000 / 2 = 4000 tickets.  Now, let's see what happens when he buys 4000 tickets with Rs. 4000. He will get 4000 x 2 = 8000 tickets.  So, in total, Dev will get 64 + 8000 = 8880 tickets.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Dev can win and lose in total.  Since he won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, the total number of games played is 16 (14 + 2).  Now, we need to find out how many times each outcome occurred.  In 16 games, Dev won 10 times (10/16) and lost 6 times (6/16). So, the final result is:  Dev wins 10 times and loses 6 times, for a total of 16 games.
Response:  We are given that Helly has 14 kg of rice and she cooked 3 kg of it for herself. Now, there are 9 people in total who came to her house after Taifun hit the area. So, the remaining amount of rice is 14 kg - 3 kg = 11 kg. Since we know that 2 kg of rice were consumed per day, the number of days the rice lasted can be calculated as follows: Number of days = Total amount of rice / Amount consumed per day = 11 kg / 2 kg/day = 5.5 days After 5.5 days, the rice would have been finished, so the answer is 5.5 days.
Response:  We are given that Helly has 13 cows and each cow gives 6 liters of milk per day. So, in total, Helly gets 13 x 6 = 78 liters of milk per day. Now, we are also given that one buffalo gives 50 liters of milk per day. So, if there were 6 buffalos (which is what the next number after 5 is), they would give 6 x 50 = 300 liters of milk per day. However, since there are only 5 buffalos, they give 6 x 50 = 300 liters of milk per day. Therefore, the total amount of milk produced every day is 78 + 300 = 478 liters.
Response:  We know that Helly has 20 kg of rice and she cooked 8 kg of it. So, there are 20/8 = 5 kg of uncooked rice left. Now, we are told that one andah (a unit of measurement) is equal to 4 kg. Therefore, the total amount of uncooked rice Helly has is 5/1 = 5 kg.  Since Charita took out 3 kg of rice, there are now 5 - 3 = 2 kg of uncooked rice left with Helly.
Response:  We have 12 goats and we want to know how many will be left after 5 of them die. So, initially, there are 12 x 5 = 60 goats. Now, 5 goats die, leaving us with 60 - 5 = 55 goats. Therefore, 55 goats will be left after 5 of them die.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of days that passed between Helena's birth and her death. According to the question, Helena was born in 1925 and died in 2016, which means she lived for approximately 91 years. Therefore, the total number of days that passed between her birth and death is:

91 years x 365 days/year = 33,745 days

Now, let's calculate the number of times Helena went to the beach after turning 40 years old. According to the question, Helena turned 40 in 1965, and she went to the beach every year thereafter. Therefore, the number of times Helena went to the beach after turning 40 is:

Years since turning 40 = 50 (as per the question)
Number of trips to the beach = Years since turning 40 x Number of days per trip
= 50 x 33,745 days
= 1,687,500 days

Finally, let's calculate the approximate number of sand castles built by Helena at the beach. As per the question, Helena built one sand castle every time she visited the beach, and each sand castle took her around 4 hours to build. Therefore, the approximate number of sand castles built by Helena is:

Total number of visits to the beach = 1,687,500 days
Average time taken to build one sand castle = 4 hours
Number of sand castles built = Total number of visits x Average time taken to build one sand castle
= 1,687,500 days x 4 hours/day
= 6,750 sand castles

Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 6,750 sand castles built by Helena at the beach."
Response:  If we start with 12 eggs and break them all, then we will have 0 eggs left. So, the number of eggs that Ollie can hold is 0.
Response:  If it takes 13 minutes to fill up 3 tons of water in a bucket, and we start filling at 8 AM, then how much time will it take to fill up 1 ton of water? Time = Distance / Speed = 13 minutes/ton x (time taken to fill 3 tons) / 3 = 4 minutes 40 seconds So, it will take approximately 4 minutes and 40 seconds to fill up 1 ton of water after starting at 8 AM.
Response:  If we start with 110 g of sugar and burn it completely to produce carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat energy, then the mass of carbon dioxide produced will be equal to the mass of sugar consumed. So, the mass of carbon dioxide produced = 110 g. Now, if we assume that each molecule of carbon dioxide has a mass of 44 g/mol (which is a reasonable assumption), then the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced = mass / molecular weight = 110 g / 44 g/mol = 2.56 x 10^23 molecules. Finally, since there are 6.022 x 10^23 atoms in every molecule of CO2, the total number of atoms of carbon released into the atmosphere through combustion = number of moles x Avogadro's constant = 2.56 x 10^23 x 6.022 x 10^23 = 1.58 x 10^47 atoms. Therefore, after burning 110 g of sugar, approximately 1.58 x 10^47 atoms of carbon would have been released into the atmosphere.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the word ""cat"" appears in the given text and then divide it by the total number of words in the text to get the average frequency of the word ""cat"".

From the given text, we can see that the word ""cat"" appears 6 times. Now, let's calculate the total number of words in the text:

Total number of words = Number of sentences x Total number of words in each sentence
= 7 x (28 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 13 + 19) / 6
= 7 x 140 / 6
= 210

Now, we can calculate the average frequency of the word ""cat"":

Average frequency of ""cat"" = Number of appearances of ""cat"" / Total number of words in the text
= 6 / 210
= 0.029 (or 2.9%)

Therefore, the average frequency of the word ""cat"" in the given text is 2.9%."
Response:  We are given that Ojha has reached his destination after traveling for 10 hours at a speed of 50 km/h. Now we need to find out how many kilometers he has traveled in total. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance traveled by Ojha is: Distance = 50 km/h x 10 h = 500 km. Therefore, Ojha has traveled a total distance of 500 km from his starting point to his destination.
Response:  We are given that Ojha reached the destination at 10 am and took 4 hours to reach there. So, he started his journey at  : 10 = . Then, we are also given that he walked for 5 km per hour. Therefore, he walked a total distance of 5 x = 20 km during his journey. Now, we need to find out how many bags of wheat he could have carried if he walked 20 km in 4 hours. To do this, we will use the formula: Total distance = Speed x Time. In this case, our speed is 5 km/hour, and time is 4 hours, so: Total distance = 5 x 4 = 20 km. Now, we know that Ojha had 56 bags of wheat with him, and each bag weighs 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the bags he carried is: Total weight = Number of bags x Weight per bag = 56 x 40 = 2240 kg. Finally, we can calculate the number of bags of wheat Ojha could have carried based on the distance he walked: Number of bags = Total distance / Distance per bag = 20 km / 5 km = 4 bags. So, Ojha could have carried 4 bags of wheat if he walked 20 km in 4 hours.
"Response:  We are given that there are 38 days in April and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in April is:

38 days × 24 hours/day = 867 hours

Now, we are asked how many times 49 days (which is the duration of the season) fit into April. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of hours in April by the number of days in the season:

867 hours / 49 days = 17.5 hours/day

So, during the entire season of 49 days, there are approximately 17.5 hours per day in April."
Response:  We are given that there are 87 days left in the growing season and each plant produces 25 tomatoes per day. So, total number of tomatoes produced by all plants = Total number of days in the growing season x Number of tomatoes produced per day = 87 x 25 = 2175 tomatoes.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for all the wheat seeds to germinate and grow into mature plants.  There are 720 wheat seeds in one borer (as per the question).  Each seed takes 35 days to germinate and grow into a mature plant (also as per the question). So, we need to calculate the total number of days required for all the seeds to germinate and grow. Total Number of Days = Number of Seeds x Time taken for each seed to Germinate and Grow = 720 x 35 = 24,600 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 24,600 days or around 69 years for all the wheat seeds in one borer to germinate and grow into mature plants.
Response:  We are given that there are 80 days in a month and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in a month = 80 x 24 = 1920 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours OJK will work in a year. Since OJK works for 16 hours a day, he works for a total of 16 x 365 = 5770 hours in a year. Therefore, the answer is 5770 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are there in total and then calculate the number of apples that can be sold per day.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 35 baskets of apples, and each basket contains 12 apples.  Now, we need to find out how many days are there in a week.  Based on the question, there are 67 boras (days) in a week.  Therefore, the total number of apples = 35 x 12 = 420 apples.  Now, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of days in a week to find out how many apples can be sold per day:  Number of apples that can be sold per day = Total number of apples / Number of days in a week = 420 apples / 67 boras = 6 apples per day.
"Response:  We are given that Ojha reached the destination at 7:40 AM and took 74 minutes to cover the distance of 32 km. Therefore, his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time taken = 32 km / 74 min = 43.6 km/h

Now, we are also given that Pata had covered 71 km in 51 days. So, his average speed for the entire journey is:

Average Speed = Total distance covered / Number of days taken = 71 km / 51 days = 14.1 km/h

Therefore, the difference between Ojha's speed and Pata's average speed is:

Difference = Ojha's speed - Pata's average speed = 43.6 km/h - 14.1 km/h = 29.5 km/h"
Response:  We have to find out how many times 76 is divisible by 10 in a day.  There are 24 hours in a day, so we can divide 76 by 24 and get 3.  Now, let's see if there are any remainders when dividing 76 by 10 three times.  When we divide 76 by 10, the remainder is 6. So, after dividing 76 by 10 thrice, the remainders will be 6, 6, and 0. Therefore, the number of times 76 is divisible by 10 in a day is 3 x 6 = 18.
"Response:  We are given that there are 28 days in a month and 52 weeks in a year. So, if we start counting from January 1st of every year, then:

January 1st to February 27th = 28 days x 4 weeks = 112 days
February 28th to March 26th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
March 27th to April 24th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
April 25th to May 23rd = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
May 24th to June 22nd = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
June 23rd to July 21st = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
July 22nd to August 19th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
August 20th to September 17th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
September 18th to October 15th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
October 16th to November 13th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
November 14th to December 12th = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
December 13th to December 31st = 30 days x 4 weeks = 120 days
Total number of days = 112 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 1120 days
Therefore, after 26 days (i.e., from March 27th to April 24th), the total number of days will be:

1120 - 26 = 1094 days"
"Response:  We are given that there are 82 bore wells in total and each bore well requires 61 cubic meters of water per day. So, the total amount of water required from all the bore wells is:

82 bore wells x 61 cubic meters/day = 4931 cubic meters/day

Now, we are also given that the depth of the bore well is 80 feet (or 24.38 meters) and it takes 25 days to fill the bore well completely. So, the volume of water that can be stored in one bore well in 25 days is:

Volume of water in one bore well = Depth of bore well x Cross-sectional area of bore well x Time taken to fill the bore well (in days)
= 24.38 m x π x 25 d
= 700.5 cubic meters

So, the total volume of water that can be stored in all the 82 bore wells in 25 days is:

Total volume of water in all bore wells = Volume of water in one bore well x Number of bore wells
= 700.5 cubic meters x 82 bore wells
= 56,035 cubic meters

Therefore, after 25 days, the total amount of water available in all the 82 bore wells is approximately 56,035 cubic meters."
"Response:  We are given that there are 31 days in April and 24 days in August. So, if we subtract the number of days in August from the total number of days in April, we get:

31 - 24 = 7

So, there are 7 more days in April than in August. Now, let's find out how many days it takes for the farmer to harvest his crops after planting them. The question states that he plants his crops every 45 days, so it will take him 45 days to harvest his crops. Therefore, the answer is:

7 x 45 = 315

So, the farmer will be able to harvest his crops after 315 days or approximately 9 months."
Response:  We are given that Ojha reached the destination at 10 am and took 4 hours to reach there. So, he started his journey at 6 am. Now, we need to find out how many kilometers he traveled in one hour. To do this, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed of Ojha's vehicle is 25 km/h, so we can plug it into the formula like this: Distance = 25 km/h x Time. Since Ojha traveled for 4 hours, the distance he covered is: Distance = 25 km/h x 4 hours = 100 km. Therefore, Ojha traveled 100 km in one hour.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the cat can jump in one minute and then calculate the total distance traveled by it in that time frame.  The cat jumps 5 boxes per second, which means it covers a distance of 5 x 74 = 370 boxes in one minute. So, the cat travels a total distance of 370 boxes / 60 seconds = 6.17 boxes per second.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it will take for all the 54 bore wells to dry up completely if each of them dries up at a rate of 18 bore wells per day. So, we need to divide 54 by 18 to get the number of days required. Therefore, it will take approximately 3 days for all the 54 bore wells to dry up completely.
"Response:  We are given that Ojha reached the destination at 3 pm and took 56 boras to reach there. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take him to cover the distance of 14 dhars (units) with an average speed of 20 km/bora.

Day = Distance / Speed
= 14 dhars / 20 km/bora
= 7 days

Therefore, Ojha will take 7 days to cover the distance of 14 dhars with an average speed of 20 km/bora."
Response:  We are given that Ojha reached the destination at 10 am and took 25 days to reach there. So, he started his journey at 10 am on day 1. Now, let's calculate how many days have passed since then until he reaches the destination. Since he takes 25 days to reach the destination, it means that in total, 25 days have passed from the time he started his journey till he reaches the destination. Therefore, the answer is 25 days.
Response:  We are given that there are 65 boys and 46 girls in a class. The teacher has asked them to bring their lunch boxes every day. Out of these, 30 boys and 20 girls have brought their lunch boxes today. So, the number of boys who did not bring their lunch boxes is 35 (65 - 30) and the number of girls who did not bring their lunch boxes is 26 (46 - 20). Therefore, the total number of students who did not bring their lunch boxes is 35 + 26 = 61.
"Response:  We are given that in 41 days, OJK made $86 profit from selling mangoes. So, his daily profit is:

$86 / 41 = $2.05 per day

Now, we are asked how many more mangoes OJK should sell to make $100 profit per day. To find this out, we need to divide the desired profit ($100) by the daily profit ($2.05):

$100 / $2.05 = 49.37 mangoes

So, OJK needs to sell at least 49 mangoes per day to make $100 profit per day."
"Response:  We are given that there are 71 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is:

71 days x 24 hours/day = 1684 hours/year

Now, we are also given that the farmer works for 60 days straight without taking any break. Therefore, the total number of hours he works in a year is:

60 days x 24 hours/day = 1440 hours/year

So, the difference between the total number of hours worked by the farmer and the total number of hours in a year is:

1684 - 1440 = 244 hours

Therefore, the farmer works an extra 244 hours per year compared to the standard working hours."
"Response:  The length of the room is 12 feet and the height is 11 feet. So, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Height = 12 x 11 = 132 square feet Now, we need to find out how much longer the smaller room is than the larger one. Let's call the length of the smaller room ""x"". Since the length of the larger room is 12 feet, we can write: x + 12 = 11 (as the shorter room is 1 foot less than the larger one) Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 9 feet Therefore, the smaller room is 9 feet longer than the larger one."
Response:  The height of the room is 7 feet and it has an area of 14 square feet. If we want to make the ceiling higher by 2 feet, how much will the volume of the room change? Volume = Length x Width x Height = 7 x 14 x 9 = 1068 cubic feet So, if we increase the ceiling height by 2 feet, the new volume of the room will be: New Volume = Old Volume + (New Height - Old Height) = 1068 + (2 - 9) = 1059 cubic feet Therefore, the volume of the room after increasing the ceiling height by 2 feet is 1059 cubic feet.
Response:  The height of Jessica is 7 feet and she wants to know how much longer her shadow will be if it is cast on a road that is 14 varge (approximately 4.25 meters) long. To find out, we need to use the formula for calculating the length of a shadow based on the angle between the sun and the object casting the shadow. We can assume that the angle between the sun and Jessica's shadow is approximately equal to the angle between the sun and the road. So, let's first calculate the angle between the sun and the road using trigonometry: tan = opposite / hypotenuse = 14 varge / √(hypotenuse^2 + opposite^2) = 14 varge / √(49 + 7^2) = 14 varge / √(368) = 0.29 radians Now, we can use the formula for calculating the length of a shadow based on the angle between the sun and the object casting the shadow: Length of shadow = shadow distance x sin(angle) = 7 ft x sin(0.29) = 5.57 ft Therefore, Jessica's shadow would be approximately 5.57 feet longer than its original length of 7 feet if it were cast on a road that is 14 varge long.
Response:  The height of the room is 11 feet and the length is 15 feet. To find out how many square feet the room area is, we need to multiply the height and length. So, the area of the room is: Area = Height x Length = 11 x 15 = 165 sq ft Now, let's calculate the perimeter of the room. Perimeter = 2 (Width + Length) = 2 (10 + 15) = 40 sq ft Finally, we can divide the perimeter by the area to get the price of the baseboard heating system required for the room: Price = Perimeter / Area = 40 / 165 = $0.25 per sq ft Therefore, the price of the baseboard heating system required for the room is approximately $37.50 ($0.25 x 165 sq ft).
Response:  The length of the room is 2 feet + 12 feet = 14 feet. Since each tile size is 4 feet long, we need to divide the total length of the room by the number of tiles. So, the number of tiles required is: Total length of room / Number of tiles per foot = 14 feet / 4 feet/tile = 3.5 tiles. Therefore, you will need 3 and half tiles to cover the entire floor of the room.
"Response:  We have two rectangles with dimensions given as follows:

Rectangle A has length 19 feet and width 18 feet.
Rectangle B has length 20 feet and width 16 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many square feet of floor space are common between these two rectangles. To do this, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

Area = Length x Width

For Rectangle A, the length is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet, so the area is:

Area of Rectangle A = 19 x 18 = 342 sq ft

For Rectangle B, the length is 20 feet and the width is 16 feet, so the area is:

Area of Rectangle B = 20 x 16 = 320 sq ft

Now, we want to know how much common floor space there is between these two rectangles. To find this, we will subtract the area of Rectangle B from the area of Rectangle A:

Common Area = Area of Rectangle A - Area of Rectangle B
= 342 - 320
= 22 sq ft

Therefore, there are 22 square feet of common floor space between the two rectangles."
Response:  The height of the room is 19 feet and its length is 20 feet. To find out how many times the height is equal to the length, we can divide them: Height = Length x Number of times the height is equal to the length. In this case, if we divide 19 feet by 20 feet, we get: 19 / 20 = 0.95 So, there are approximately 0.95 times (or 95%) as long as the height of the room is to its width.
Response:  We have to find out how many feet are there in total and then calculate the length of each compartment.  The total number of feet is given as 10 varge (which means 10 x 3 = 30 feet). Now we need to divide this total length among the 4 compartments. Since each compartment should be equal in length, we will divide the total length equally among them. So, the length of each compartment will be 30/4 = 7.5 feet.  Now let's consider the height of each compartment. As per the question, if the height of one compartment is 5 feet, then the height of all the four compartments together would be 5 x 4 = 20 feet. Therefore, the height of each compartment is 20 / 4 = 5 feet.
Response:  We have to find out how many feet are there in total and then calculate the length of each compartment.  The total area of the room is given as 10 x 20 = 200 square feet. Since we want to divide it into 10 equal parts, each part will be 20 square feet. Now, let's find out the length of each compartment. If the height of the room is 8 feet, then the length will be half of that, i.e., 4 feet. So, the length of each compartment will be 20 square feet / 4 feet = 5 feet. Therefore, there are 10 compartments in total, each measuring 5 feet long and 20 square feet in area.
"Response:  We have to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for a room that is 18 feet wide and 20 feet long. To do this, we need to multiply the width and length of the room in feet. So, the area of the room is: Area = Width x Length = 18 x 20 = 360 square feet Now, we want to know how much of this area is covered with carpet. The question says that the carpet covers ""most"" of the floor, which means that not all of the floor will be covered with carpet. Let's assume that about 75% of the floor is covered with carpet (this is just an estimate, you may need to adjust it based on your specific situation). So, the amount of carpet needed is: Amount of carpet = Area x Percentage covered = 360 x 0.75 = 270 square feet Therefore, you would need approximately 270 square feet of carpet to cover most of the floor in a room that is 18 feet wide and 20 feet long."
"Response:  We have to find out how many t-shirts each person can sell in one day to make $230 profit.  So, we need to calculate the number of t-shirts that can be sold per day.  To do this, we will divide the total amount of money earned ($230) by the cost price of each t-shirt ($15).  Therefore, the number of t-shirts that can be sold per day is:
$230 / $15 = 15 t-shirts per day
So, if all 23 people sell t-shirts for 8 hours a day, they can sell a total of:
23 x 15 = 345 t-shirts per day
Now, let's assume that each person sells an average of 2 t-shirts per hour (this is just an assumption, as it may vary depending on various factors such as their sales skills and marketing strategies).
Therefore, the total number of t-shirts that each person can sell in one day is:
345 t-shirts / 8 hours = 43 t-shirts per person per day
So, if all 23 people sell t-shirts for 8 hours a day, they can collectively sell:
23 x 43 = 971 t-shirts per day"
Response:  We know that Raj has earned $ 51 dollars in total from selling three T-shirts during an Arkansas game. Now we need to find out how much money he made per T-shirt. To do this, we will divide the total amount of money he earned ($ 51) by the number of T-shirts he sold (three). So, the cost price of each T-shirt is: $ 51 / 3 = $ 17 per T-shirt.
Response:  We know that Raju has 87 dollars and he wants to buy 95 t-shirts. So, he needs money to make up for the difference between his current balance and the cost of the t-shirts. The total cost of buying all 95 t-shirts is $950. Now, we need to find out how much money Raju will have left after buying all those t-shirts. To do this, we divide the total cost of the t-shirts by the number of t-shirts he wants to buy: $$ \frac {950} {95} = 10 $$ So, Raju will have $10 left after buying all 95 t-shirts.
Response:  We know that Raj has sold each of his 106 t-shirts for $106 each. So, he has earned total revenue of $106 x 106 = $1,0928 from selling those t-shirts. Now, we are told that Arkansa played Texas Hold'em and won $243 in one session. So, if Arkansa plays Texas Hold'em during the time it takes to sell all 115 t-shirts (i.e., 2 hours), then he will win $243 / 2 = $121.5 per session. Therefore, the number of sessions it would take Arkansa to earn as much money as Raj did selling t-shirts is: $1,0928 / $121.5 = 8,780 sessions.
Response:  We know that Raj has 163 t-shirts to sell and he wants to make at least $98 per day.  If he sells each t-shirt for $98, then he will make a total of $163 x 98 = $157,440 in one day.  Now, let's assume that Arkansa plays cricket for 2 days and sells all his t-shirts during these two days. So, he will make a total of $157,440 x 2 = $314,880 in those two days. Therefore, if Arkansa sells all his t-shirts during the two days of cricket match, he will make $314,880.
Response:  We have to find out how much money each t-shirt sold for and then calculate the total amount of money earned from selling all 186 t-shirts.  If each t-shirt was sold for $78, then we can calculate the total amount of money earned as follows: Total Amount of Money Earned = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt Total Amount of Money Earned = 186 x $78 Total Amount of Money Earned = $14,304 So, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the game, the total amount of money earned would be $14,304 - $14,204 = $900.
"Response:  We have to find out how many T-shirts and jeans can be sold in total for each price range.  For T-shirts, we know that there are 183 T-shirts available at $62 each, so the total number of T-shirts that can be sold is:

$$ \text {Total no. of T-shirts} = \text {No. of T-shirts at } $62 \times \frac{\text{Total quantity}}{\text{Price}} $$

We also know that there are 31 jeans available at $99 each, so the total number of jeans that can be sold is:

$$ \text {Total no. of jeans} = \text {No. of jeans at } $99 \times \frac{\text{Total quantity}}{\text{Price}} $$

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from both T-shirts and jeans:

$$ \text {Total revenue} = \text {Total no. of T-shirts} \times \$62 + \text {Total no. of jeans} \times \$99 $$

Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:

$$ \text {Total revenue} = 183 \times \$62 + 31 \times \$99 = \$10,753 $$

So, if all 183 T-shirts and 31 jeans are sold, the total revenue will be $10,753."
Response:  We have to find out how many T-shirts and jeans can be made with the given amount of money.  The cost of each T-shirt is $ 67, and that of each pair of jeans is $ 165. Now we need to calculate how much money will be left after buying these clothes.  If we buy 74 T-shirts and 156 pairs of jeans, then the total cost will be:  T-shirts = 74 x $ 67 = $ 4892  Jeans = 156 x $ 165 = $ 25,300 Total Cost = $ 4892 + $ 25,300 = $ 30,192 Now, let's see how much money will be left after buying these clothes: Money Left = Total Cost - (T-shirts x Price of T-shirts) - (Jeans x Price of Jeans) = $ 30,192 - ($ 4892 x 74%) - ($ 25,300 x 74%) = $ 30,192 - $ 33,396 - $ 18,512 = $ 7,286 So, there will be $ 7,286 left after buying these clothes.
Response:  We have to calculate the total cost of 192 T-shirts and 34 jackets. The cost per T-shirt is $19.20, and the cost per jacket is $34. So, the total cost of 192 T-shirts will be: $19.20 x 192 = $3658.80 And the total cost of 34 jackets will be: $34 x 34 = $1156. Therefore, the total cost of all 192 T-shirts and 34 jackets together is: $3658.80 + $1156 = $4814.80
Response:  We know that each T-shirt costs $86 and each jeans cost $232. So, if we want to calculate how much one T-shirt and one pair of jeans will cost together, we need to multiply their individual prices. Therefore, the total cost of one T-shirt is $86 x 1 = $86, and the total cost of one pair of jeans is $232 x 1 = $232. Now, let's find out how many T-shirts and pairs of jeans can be bought with $254. To do this, we divide the amount of money ($254) by the cost of one T-shirt or pair of jeans. For example, to find out how many T-shirts can be bought with $254, we divide $254 by $86, which gives us approximately 3 T-shirts. Similarly, to find out how many pairs of jeans can be bought with $254, we divide $254 by $232, which gives us approximately 11 pairs of jeans. Therefore, one T-shirt and one pair of jeans will not cost exactly $254.
Response:  We have to find out how many T-shirts can be sold at $51 each and then calculate the total revenue from selling those T-shirts.  The cost price of each T-shirt is given as $30, so we need to subtract that amount from the selling price to get the profit per T-shirt.  Profit per T-shirt = Selling price - Cost price = $51 - $30 = $21 per T-shirt.  Now, we are asked to find out how many T-shirts can be sold at this price to make a profit of $130.  To do this, we simply divide the profit per T-shirt ($21) by the selling price ($51): Number of T-shirts that can be sold = Profit per T-shirt / Selling price = $21/$51 = 4.18 T-shirts.  So, approximately 4 T-shirts can be sold to make a profit of $130.
Response:  We have to find out how many t-shirts can be sold at $217 each and then calculate the total revenue from those sales.  The cost price of each t-shirt is $201, so we can sell them for $217 each to make a profit of $16 per t-shirt.  To find out how many t-shirts can be sold, we need to divide the total revenue by the cost price per t-shirt.  So, if we want to know how many t-shirts can be sold, we can use the following formula: Number of t-shirts = Total revenue / Cost price per t-shirt  In this case, the total revenue is $358 (217 x 14), and the cost price per t-shirt is $201.  Therefore, we can sell 17 t-shirts ($358 / $201).
Response:  We know that Arcanas sold each T-shirt for $60 during the 30 days of the sale. So, the total number of T-shirts sold = Total revenue / Selling price per T-shirt = $60 x 30 = 1800 T-shirts. Now, we need to find out how much money Reservoir made from selling each T-shirt. To do this, we will divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold. Therefore, the amount of money Reservoir made from each T-shirt = Total revenue / Number of T-shirts sold = $1800 / 1800 = $10 per T-shirt.
Response:  We know that there are 5 T-shirts and each T-shirt costs $215. So, the total cost of all 5 T-shirts is: 5 x $215 = $1075. Now, we need to find out how much money Arcansa made from selling these T-shirts. Since he sold them for $5 each, the total amount of money he made from selling all 5 T-shirts is: $1075 x 5 = $5375.
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts and jackets are sold in total.  From the given information, we know that 50 jerseys were sold at $215 each, which is equal to $10750.  Now, let's calculate the number of shirts sold. The cost of 215 shirts is $215 x 215 = $46825. So, the total amount of money earned from both shirts and jackets is $10750 + $46825 = $57575. Therefore, the answer is 57575.
Response:  We know that Raj has sold each t-shirt for $204 and each jacket for $760. So, in total, he has earned $158 per item. Now, we need to find out how many items Raj has sold altogether. According to the question, Raj has sold 158 t-shirts and 204 jackets in total. Therefore, the total number of items Raj has sold is: 158 + 204 = 362 items.
"Response:  We have to find out how many shirts and jackets can be bought with $210 and $240 respectively.  So, we will divide each amount by their respective prices per unit.  For shirts, the price is $23 per unit, so:
$210 / $23 = 9 units of shirts can be bought.
For jackets, the price is $26 per unit, so:
$240 / $26 = 9 units of jackets can be bought as well.
Now, since both shirts and jackets are being sold in sets of 3, we need to multiply the number of units by 3 to get the total number of pieces that can be bought. Therefore:
Total number of shirts that can be bought = 9 x 3 = 27 shirts.
Total number of jackets that can be bought = 9 x 3 = 27 jackets."
Response:  We have to find out how many shirts and dresses are needed for each person in order to make $115 per day.  For this, we will divide $115 by $25 (the cost of one t-shirt). This gives us 4.6 people who can buy one t-shirt per day. Now, let's calculate how many days it takes to sell all the t-shirts and dresses. We know that there are 113 t-shirts and 78 dresses in total. To find out how many days it takes to sell these clothes, we will divide the total number of clothes by the number of people buying them per day. So, if 4.6 people buy one t-shirt per day, it will take approximately 25.9 days to sell all the t-shirts (113 / 4.6 = 25.9) and 18.5 days to sell all the dresses (78 / 4.6 = 18.5). Therefore, after selling all the clothes, one t-shirt will be left over.
Response:  We have to find out how many sets of 10 cups each are required for 50 people.  So, we need to divide 50 by 10 to get the number of sets.  Therefore, the answer is 5 sets.
"Response:  We have to find out how many tables are needed for 20 people and then multiply it with the number of cups per table. So, we need to divide 20 by 4 (as there are 4 people in each table) to get the number of tables required:

$$ \frac{20}{4} = 5 $$

So, we need 5 tables to accommodate 20 people. Now, let's calculate the total number of cups required:

$$ \text {Number of cups} = \text {Total number of people} \times \text {Number of cups per person} $$

Since there are 4 people in each table, we can assume that each table requires 4 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups required is:

$$ \boxed{\text {Total number of cups}} = 5 \times 4 = 20 $$

Therefore, the answer is $20$."
Response:  We have to find out how many sets of three cups each we can make from 9 cups of water.  Since there are 3 cups in each set, we need to divide 9 by 3 to get the number of sets. So, the answer is 3 sets of three cups each.
Response:  We have to find out how many tables are required for each participant in the party and then multiply it with the number of participants to get the total number of tables needed.  So, let's assume that each table can accommodate 4 people comfortably.  Now, we know that there will be 11 parties, and each party has 13 guests.  Therefore, the total number of guests attending all the parties is 11 x 13 = 143 guests.  Since each guest needs one table, we need to divide the total number of guests by 4 to get the total number of tables required: 143 / 4 = 35 + 2 (for the host and hostess) = 37 tables.
Response:  We have to calculate how many cups of water are required for each person in the party and then find out if there is enough water available.  For this, we need to know the number of people attending the party.  Based on the question, there are 20 people attending the party.  Now, let's assume that each person requires 6 cups of water per day (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, the total number of cups of water required for all the guests at the party would be:  Number of guests x Required cups of water per guest = 20 x 6 = 120 cups of water.  However, as mentioned in the question, there are only 10 tables with 6 cups of water each. So, we can see that there are not enough cups of water available for all the guests at the party. In fact, there are only enough cups of water for about 83% of the guests (120 / 10 = 0.83).
Response:  We have to calculate the total number of cups required for each set and then add them up to get the total number of cups needed.  For Set A, we need 4 cups (as mentioned in the question). For Set B, we need 6 cups (also mentioned in the question). So, the total number of cups required for both sets is: 4 + 6 = 10 cups. Therefore, there are 10 cups in total that the guests will need.
Response:  There are 14 people in the party and each person has to buy 3 cups of tea. So, total number of cups required = 14 x 3 = 42 cups.
"Response:  We have to find out how many tables are required for each person in the party and then calculate the total number of tables needed.  Based on the given information, we know that there will be 9 tables at the party and each table can accommodate 14 people. So, to find out how many tables are required for one person, we need to divide the number of tables by the number of people who can sit on each table. Therefore, the number of tables required for one person is:

Number of tables / Number of people per table = 9 / 14 = 0.64

Since you cannot have a fraction of a table, we round off the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of tables required for one person is:

0.64 rounded off to the nearest whole number = 1

So, if there are 9 tables in total, then each person at the party will require approximately 1 table."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis can make in one week (7 days) if he works for 5 hours per day and his hourly wage is $12.  So, daily income = $12 x 5 hours/day = $60 per day. Now, let's calculate how much money Lewis can make in one month (30 days). Daily income = $60 x 30 days = $1800 per month. Finally, let's calculate how much money Lewis can save in five weeks (35 days) if he saves $500 per week. Savings = $500 x 35 days = $17,500. Therefore, Lewis can save $17,500 in five weeks.
"Response:  We know that Louisa has invested $1216 in farming and earned $16 per week. To calculate how many weeks she can continue farming, we need to divide her total investment by her weekly earnings:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

So, Louisa can continue farming for 78 weeks before running out of money."
Response:  If Louis spends $216 per month for 7 months and earns $702 in total, then he will have $486 left after paying off his debt of $216 x 7 = $1532. So, Louis will have $486 - $1532 = $-1046 left after paying off his debt.
Response:  If Lewis harvests every week for 223 weeks in a year, he will have harvested for 1357 weeks in 7 years (since there are 52 weeks in a year). So, the total amount of wheat harvested by Lewis in 7 years is: Total Wheat Harvested = Number of Weeks x Amount per Week = 1357 weeks x $1357 = $1840,690.
Response:  We know that Louis earns $28 per week during each of the seven weeks in his seasonal job. So, he earns a total of $28 x 7 = $196 for those seven weeks. Now, we are told that he also works as an additional four weeks at $939 per week. Therefore, his total earnings from both jobs is $196 + ($939 x 4) = $196 + $3776 = $3952.
Response:  We are given that Louis makes $403 per week and wants to know how much he can make in 233 weeks (which is approximately equal to 5 years). So, we need to calculate the total amount of money Louis will have made after 5 years. To do this, we multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he has worked: Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks Worked = $403 x 233 = $93,610 Now, let's convert this amount from dollars to rupees using the current exchange rate (approximately 1 USD = 70 INR): Total Income in Rupees = $93,610 x 70 INR/USD = ₹6,287,700 After 5 years, Louis will have earned a total of ₹6,287,700 ($93,610) working 233 weeks at $403 per week.
Response:  Louis earns $368 per week and spends $1359 every 13 weeks. If he invests $388 in each of those 13 weeks, then he will have $388 x 13 = $4720 after 13 weeks. So, his profit is $4720 - $1359 = $3361.
Response:  We are given that Louis spent $1181 in total for 7 weeks of farming and earned $491 per week. So, his total earnings from farming were: Total Earnings = Number of Weeks x Weekly Earning = 7 x $491 = $3177. Now, we need to find out how much he spent each week on average. To do this, we will divide his total spending by the number of weeks he spent money: Average Spending Per Week = Total Spending / Number of Weeks = $3177 / 7 = $450 per week. Therefore, Louis spent an average of $450 per week on farming during those 7 weeks.
Response:  Lewis has been working for 19 weeks and earned $133 per week. If he works for one more week, how much money will he earn in that week? So, if he works for one more week, he will earn $134 dollars. Therefore, after one more week, his total earnings would be $134 + (133 x 18) = $2652.
"Response:  If Louis makes $2 per hour working in his garden every weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he will make a total of $34 per week ($2/hour x 2 days x 7 hours/day). Now, if he works for 50 weeks in a year (assuming no breaks or holidays), his annual income from gardening would be:
Annual Income = Total Weekly Income x Number of Weeks Worked
= $34/week x 50 weeks
= $1,700/year
So, Louis can expect to earn around $1,700 per year from his gardening hobby."
"Response:  If Vishram Kayalak Badi O Sbh Pohari Par Jaye Lelak (If Vishram Kayalak goes to Sbh Pohari and stays there for 10 days), then he will have spent a total of 10 x 24 = 240 hours at Sbh Pohari. Now, if he spends 9 feet in height and 10 feet in width, then his volume would be 9 x 10 = 90 cubic feet. So, the ratio of his volume to the time he stayed at Sbh Pohari is:

Volume : Time = 90 cubic feet : 240 hours = 0.375 cubic feet per hour

Therefore, the answer is 0.375 cubic feet per hour."
"Response:  We have to find out how many feet are there in total and then calculate the height of Ron.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - ""विश्राम कयलाक बाद ओ सभ पोखरि पर जाए लेल निर्णय केलक"". This means that Vishram has walked for 140 miles (which is equal to 225 kilometers) and reached a place where he had to take a decision. Now, we need to convert this distance into feet. There are 5,280 feet in one mile, so the distance Vishram walked is: 140 miles x 5,280 feet/mile = 73,600 feet. Next, we come to the second part of the question - ""पानीक गहराई डीनक उचाइसँ दुगुना अछि ।"" This means that Pani has dug a well which is 14 feet deep. Finally, we come to the last part of the question - ""डीन रॉन सँ आठ फीट छोट अछि."" This means that Ron is 7 feet tall. So, now we can calculate his height in feet as follows: Height of Ron = 7 feet + 14 feet (depth of the well) = 21 feet. Therefore, the height of Ron is 21 feet."
Response:  We have to find out how much water will be required for irrigation in each field and then calculate the total amount of water needed for all fields.  The area of each field is given as follows:  Field A - 5 bighas (30,000 square feet) Field B - 7 bighas (49,000 square feet) Field C - 8 bighas (56,000 square feet) Field D - 10 bighas (64,000 square feet) Field E - 12 bighas (75,000 square feet)  Therefore, the total area of all five fields is:  Total Area = 5 + 7 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 48 bighas (312,000 square feet) Now, we need to determine how much water is required for each field based on its size. Let's assume that one bigha requires 100 cubic meters of water for irrigation purposes. So, the total water requirement for all five fields can be calculated as follows:  Water Requirement = Total Area x Water Required per Bigha = 48 bighas x 100 cubic meters/bigha = 4,800 cubic meters Of course, this is just an estimate since actual water requirements may vary depending on factors such as soil type, crop variety, weather conditions, etc. But hopefully, this gives you an idea of how much water might be needed for irrigation in these fields.
Response:  We have to find out how much water is required for each plant and then calculate the total amount of water needed for all plants together.  For this, we need to know the size of each plant in feet.  From the given information, we can see that there are 15 basins with an average depth of 6 inches each, which means they hold 120 cubic feet of water (15 x 6 = 90). Now, let's assume that each dinosaur requires 13 feet of water per day. So, the total amount of water required for all dinosaurs would be 13 x 13 = 169 feet (since there are 13 dinosaurs in total). However, since Ron has already filled up 4 feet of water from one basin, he has saved 4 feet of water for himself, which means he only needs 165 feet of water for all his dinosaurs (169 - 4 = 165). But wait! There's more! Since Denis has 7 basins, he has saved even more water than Ron. He has saved 28 feet of water (7 x 6 = 42), which means he only needs 137 feet of water for all his dinosaurs (165 - 28 = 137). And finally, there's Pooh, who has 5 basins and has saved 30 feet of water (5 x 6 = 30), which means he only needs 107 feet of water for all his dinosaurs (137 - 30 = 107). So, the final answer is: 107 + 137 + 165 = 409 feet of water needed for all the dinosaurs together.
"Response:  We have to find out how much water is required for Ronak and Din to take bath together in a bathtub of capacity 16 gallons. Since both of them are taking bath simultaneously, we need to divide the total capacity of the bathtub by the number of people taking bath. So, the amount of water required for each person will be:

Total capacity of bathtub = 16 gallons
Number of people taking bath = 2 (Ronak and Din)
Amount of water required per person = Total capacity / Number of people taking bath
= 16 gallons / 2
= 8 gallons per person
Therefore, Ronak requires 8 gallons of water and Din requires 8 gallons of water as well, since they are taking bath together."
Response:  We have to find out how many times the length of Ron's body (15 feet) is equal to or greater than the height of Shravan (9 feet). So, we need to divide the length of Ron's body by the height of Shravan and see if it gives us a whole number or not.  When we divide 15 by 9, we get 1.67. Since this is not a whole number, Ron's body is longer than Shravan's height by more than half. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have three books with different prices - $34, $20, and $15. If we buy all three books together, their total cost would be $69 ($34 + $20 + $15). Now, if we buy two of these books, the price of each book would be reduced to $30 ($69 / 2 = $30). So, the price of one book is $30.
Response:  We have to find out how many books Brain can read in total and then divide it by 42 to get the average number of pages he can read per book.  So, let's calculate the total number of books Brain can read: 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 20 books. Now, each book has 200 pages, so the total number of pages Brain can read is: 20 x 200 = 4000 pages. Divided by 42, we get an average of 96 pages per book.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then divide it by 80 to get the average number of books per shelf. So, let's break down the given information:  Bookshelves: 27 Books on each shelf: 80 Books Total books: 27 x 80 = 2160 Books per shelf: 2160 / 80 = 27 Now we can see that there are approximately 27 books on each shelf, and since there are 3 shelves in total, the total number of books is 27 x 3 = 81.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then divide it by 10 to get the average number of pages per book. So, let's calculate the total number of books first. From the given information, we know that Brain has written 10 books and each book contains 96 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages written by Brain is: Total Number of Pages = 10 x 96 = 960 pages Now, let's divide the total number of pages by 10 to get the average number of pages per book: Average Number of Pages per Book = 960 / 10 = 96 pages So, the answer to the question is 96 pages.
Response:  We have to find out how many books are there in total and then divide it by 29 to get the average number of books per issue. So, let's calculate the total number of books first. According to the question, there are 61 books in all. Now, we need to divide it by 23 to find out the average number of books per issue. Therefore, the answer is:  Average number of books per issue = Total number of books / Number of issues = 61 books / 23 issues = 2.66 books per issue
"Response:  We have to find out how many books Brain has in total and then divide it equally among all the people present there.  So, if Brain has 28 books in total, and there are 7 people present there, each person will get:

28 / 7 = 4 books per person"
Response:  We have to find out how many books Brain can read in total if he reads each book for 2 hours and there are 38 books in total.  So, the time taken to read one book is 2 hours/book = 1 hour per book. Since Brain can read 20 books at a time, the number of books he can read in 1 hour is 20 books / 1 hour = 20 books/hour. Therefore, the total number of books Brain can read in 38 hours is 38 hours x 20 books/hour = 760 books.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of cake are required for each friend based on their age group.  For example, if we want to give one packet of cake to each friend who is between 21-30 years old, then we will need 4 packets (since there are 4 friends in this age group). Similarly, if we want to give two packets of cake to each friend who is between 31-40 years old, then we will need 8 packets (since there are 8 friends in this age group). Therefore, the total number of packets of cake required is: 4 + 8 = 12 packets. So, there are 12 packets of cake required for all the friends.
Response:  We have three friends - A, B, and C. They are celebrating their birthdays today. Each friend has brought three gifts for the others. So, in total, there will be 3 x 3 = 9 gifts. Now, each gift contains an equal number of candles. Therefore, the total number of candles among all the gifts is also 9. Since each candle represents one year of age, the total number of years among all the gifts is also 9. So, the sum of ages of the three friends is 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 years.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of cake are required for each friend based on their age group and then calculate the total number of packets needed for all friends.  For example, if we want to give one packet of cake per friend who is above 60 years old, then we will need 15 packets (since there are 15 friends in this category). Similarly, if we want to give two packets of cake per friend who is between 40-59 years old, then we will need 7 packets (since there are 7 friends in this category). Finally, if we want to give three packets of cake per friend who is below 30 years old, then we will need 21 packets (since there are 21 friends in this category). Therefore, the total number of packets of cake required is: 15 + 7 + 21 = 43 packets.
Response:  We have to calculate the total cost of all the packets and then find out how many packets each friend can buy.  The cost of each packet is Rs 14, so we need to multiply it by the number of packets available for each friend.  For example, if a friend has 14 packets, they will pay Rs 14 x 14 = Rs 196.  Now, let's see how many friends can buy 11 packets each.  If there are 25 friends in total, and each friend can buy 11 packets, then the total number of packets that can be bought is 25 x 11 = 275 packets.  So, the remaining packets (275 - 250 = 25 packets) cannot be bought by any friend.
Response:  Karol has 9 friends and each friend gives him Rs. 10 as a gift on his birthday. So, in total, Karol receives Rs. 90 (9 x Rs. 10) as gifts from his friends. Now, if he wants to buy three more packets of chips worth Rs. 50 each, he will have to spend an additional amount of Rs. 150 (3 x Rs. 50). Therefore, the total amount that Karol spends is Rs. 240 (Rs. 90 + Rs. 150).
"Response:  We know that Melisa has scored 12 marks in each of the 12 games she played. So, the total number of marks she got is:

12 x 12 = 144

Now, we are told that if Ollie had scored 36 marks in all the 12 games he played, then how many games did he play?

So, the ratio of the number of games played by Melisa and Ollie is:

12/36 = 1/2

Therefore, Melisa played 6 games and Ollie played 12 games."
Response:  Melisa has scored 81 points in total and wants to divide them equally among 3 games. So, she will score 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  We know that Melisa has scored 109 marks in each game and obtained 82 bonus points. Now we have to find out how many marks she got in total for 79 games. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total marks = (Number of games x Marks obtained per game) + Bonus points Total marks = (79 x 109) + (82 x 79) Total marks = 6,531 + 6,145 Total marks = 12,676 Therefore, Melisa got 12,676 marks in total for playing 79 games.
Response:  Melisa has played 21 games and scored 7 points in each game. Therefore, she has scored a total of 21 x 7 = 147 points.
Response:  We have to find out how many ankas Melisa can get in total and then divide it equally among all games.  So, let's first calculate the total number of ankas Melisa can get:  Total ankas = Number of games x Ankas per game = 13 x 91 = 1133 ankas Now, we need to divide this amount equally among all games:  Number of ankas each game gets = Total ankas / Number of games = 1133 / 13 = 87 ankas Therefore, each game will receive 87 ankas.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each seat can accommodate 20 people in one hour. So, we need to divide the total number of seats (100) by the time period (one hour). Therefore, the answer is:

Number of times each seat can accommodate 20 people = Total number of seats / Time period
= 100 / 1
= 100

So, each seat can accommodate 20 people once in an hour."
Response:  We have to find out how many seats can be filled with 9 people in each seat. So, we need to divide 18 by 9.  When we do that, we get 2. Therefore, there can be 2 seats filled with 9 people each.
"Response:  We have to find out how many seats are available in each ferry and then calculate the total number of seats that can accommodate 20 people at once.  So, let's assume there are 19 ferries with different seat capacities as follows: Ferry 1 has 36 seats; Ferry 2 has 48 seats; Ferry 3 has 52 seats; Ferry 4 has 60 seats; Ferry 5 has 72 seats; Ferry 6 has 84 seats; Ferry 7 has 96 seats; Ferry 8 has 108 seats; Ferry 9 has 120 seats; Ferry 10 has 132 seats; Ferry 11 has 144 seats; Ferry 12 has 156 seats; Ferry 13 has 168 seats; Ferry 14 has 180 seats; Ferry 15 has 192 seats; Ferry 16 has 204 seats; Ferry 17 has 216 seats; Ferry 18 has 228 seats; Ferry 19 has 240 seats. Now, we need to find out how many seats are available for 20 people at once. Let's assume all ferries have equal capacity, so we can take any one ferry as an example. For instance, let's consider Ferry 1 with 36 seats. If 20 people want to travel together, they will occupy all 36 seats. Therefore, the answer is 36."
Response:  We have 18 seats in total and each seat has 15 goats as its weight. If 10 seats get damaged, we will have 180 goats less than the original amount. So, the remaining number of goats after 10 seats get damaged is: 180 - 18 = 162 goats.
Response:  We have to find out how many gote are required for each seat and then multiply it with the total number of seats to get the total amount of gote required.  So, let's start by finding out how many gote are required for one seat. According to the question, each seat requires 14 gote. Now, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. From the question, we know that there are 6 trays, and each tray has 16 gote. Therefore, the total number of seats is: 6 trays x 16 gote/tray = 96 seats. Now, we can calculate the total amount of gote required as follows: Total amount of gote required = Number of seats x Required gote per seat = 96 seats x 14 gote/seat = 1352 gote.
Response:  We have two small seats and three large seats. Each small seat can accommodate 2 people, so we have a total of 4 people who can sit in those seats (2 x 2 = 4). Now, each large seat can accommodate 5 people, so we have a total of 14 people who can sit in those seats (3 x 5 = 15). Therefore, there are 19 people (4 + 15) who can sit in all the seats combined.
Response:  We have three small seats and six large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate one person, so we have a total of 3 x 1 = 3 people who can sit on the small seats. Similarly, each large seat can accommodate two people, so we have a total of 6 x 2 = 12 people who can sit on the large seats. Therefore, there are 3 + 12 = 15 people who can sit on both types of seats combined.
Response:  If there are 16 goats in one field and each goat can eat 4 bags of wheat, then how many bags of wheat will be eaten altogether?  We need to calculate this by multiplying the number of goats with the number of bags each goat can eat. So, the total number of bags of wheat eaten will be: 16 x 4 = 64 bags of wheat.
"Response:  If each seat can hold 4 people, and there are 10 seats in total, then the maximum number of people that can go to heaven at one time is:

Response:  We have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices. So, in total we have 7 x 8 = 56 slices of pizza. Now, if there are 14 people to share these slices equally among them, then each person will get 56 / 14 = 4 slices of pizza.
Response:  We have 28 slates and each slate has 2 tonnes of soil. So, we need to calculate how many tonnes of soil we will get in total. To do this, we multiply the number of slates with the amount of soil in each slate:  Number of slates = 28 Slates x Amount of soil per slate = 2 x 2 = 4 tonnes Total amount of soil needed = 4 tonnes x 28 slates = 112 tonnes
"Response:  We have 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we have a total of 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. Now, let's calculate how many pieces (or ""tukdars"") of pizza each person will get if there are 25 people in total. To do this, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 68 slices / 25 people = 2.68 tukdars per person. Therefore, each person will get approximately 2.68 tukdars of pizza."
Response:  We have 9 pizzas to share among us. Each pizza has 10 slices, so we will get 9 x 10 = 90 slices in total. Since there are 2 of us, each person will get 45 slices (90 / 2).
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are in each pot and then multiply it with the number of pots. So, let's calculate the total number of flowers first. Each pot has 12 flowers, so there are 12 x 4 = 48 flowers in all 45 pots. Now, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of pots to get the average number of flowers per pot. Therefore, the average number of flowers per pot is 48 / 45 = 106 flowers per pot.
Response:  We have 9 flowers and each flower has 45 seeds. So, total number of seeds = 9 x 45 = 405 seeds. Now, we are asked how many seeds will be left if one seed is removed from each flower. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of flowers. Total number of seeds / Number of flowers = 405 seeds / 9 flowers = 45 seeds per flower. Therefore, after removing one seed from each flower, there will be 45 seeds remaining in each flower.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are in each pot and then calculate the total number of flowers.  Each pot has 12 flowers, so there are 12 x 36 = 432 flowers in all.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers will bloom in total and then calculate the number of seeds per flower.  Based on the given information, we can conclude that there are 55 flowers in each pot and each flower has 15 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds in all pots is 55 x 15 = 825 seeds. Now, let's assume that every flower blooms for 3 days, so the total number of days that all flowers will bloom is 825 / 3 = 275 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are there in total and then calculate the number of seeds required for each flower.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many flowers are there in total?  Based on the information given in the question, we can see that there are 60 baskets of flowers, and each basket contains 10 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is: 60 x 10 = 600 flowers. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question - How many seeds are required for each flower? As per the question, each flower requires 10 seeds. So, the total number of seeds required for all 600 flowers is: 600 x 10 = 6,000 seeds.
"Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are there in each flower and then multiply it with the total number of flowers to get the total number of seeds.  So, let's start by finding out how many seeds are there in each flower. According to the question, ""each flower has 8-10 seeds"". Therefore, the number of seeds in each flower is 8 or 10. Now, we need to find out the total number of flowers. The question states that there are 32 trees, and each tree has 50 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 32 x 50 = 1600 flowers. Now, we can calculate the total number of seeds as follows: Total number of seeds = Number of seeds in each flower x Total number of flowers = 8/10 x 1600 = 1280 seeds. Therefore, there are 1280 seeds in the entire field of 32 trees."

Response:  There are 7 friends - A, B, C, D, E, F and G. They want to share equally among themselves. So, they will get 1/7 of 21 kg = 3 kg each. Therefore, each friend will get 3 kg of potatoes.
Response:  We have 18 friends and we want to equally distribute them among 36 boxes. Each box can hold 2 people. So, we need to divide 18 by 36 to find out how many people each box can hold.  Therefore, each box can hold 0.5 people (or 1/36 of an person).
Response:  We have to divide 36 into 6 equal parts of 6 each. So we will get 6 x 6 = 36 pieces of patakhe (patta or leaf). Therefore, out of 36 leaves, Mitra will give 6 leaves to each of his 6 friends.
Response:  There are 23 friends in total and each friend eats 11 rotis. So, the total number of rotis eaten is: 23 x 11 = 253 rotis.
Response:  Mathyuk has 31 rotis and wants to distribute them equally among his 5 friends. Each friend will get 6 rotis (31/5 = 6). Now, Mathyuk has 23 extra rotis left over (31 - 6 x 5 = 23). So, he can give 7 rotis each to all his 5 friends (23 / 5 = 7), leaving him with no extra rotis left over.
Response:  We have to divide 320 by 98, which gives us 3.25. So, each person will get approximately 3.25 tonnes of rice.
Response:  We have 10 apples and we want to distribute them equally among 8 people. So, each person will get 1 apple.
Response:  If there are 28 friends and each friend has to eat 13 packets of chips, then total number of packets required = 28 x 13 = 340 packets. Now, if each packet contains 15 chips, then total number of chips required = 340 packets x 15 chips/packet = 5100 chips. So, each person will have to eat 5100 chips in total.
"Response:  We are given that Debi has 109 bottles of kinnik (a type of liquor) and she wants to sell them in 74 days. Now, we need to find out how many bottles she will have left after selling them for 74 days.

To do this, we can use the formula: Number of bottles remaining = Total number of bottles x (Number of days / Days taken to sell one bottle).

From the question, we know that Debi takes 1 day to sell one bottle of kinnik. So, if she sells one bottle per day, then after 74 days, she will have sold 74 bottles.

Now, let's plug in these values into the formula: Number of bottles remaining = 109 bottles x (74 days / 1 day/bottle) = 109 bottles x 74 = 8260 bottles.

So, after selling her kinnik for 74 days, Debi will have 8260 bottles left."
Response:  We are given that Debi has 153 bottles of milk and she wants to distribute them equally among all the children in her neighborhood. Since there are 20 children in total, each child will get 7-8 bottles of milk (since we can't divide 153 by 20 exactly). Now, let's assume that Omi takes 17 days to finish his share of milk. So, he will get 17 x 7 = 119 bottles of milk during those 17 days.
Response:  We are given that Debi bought 264 bottles of panic at Rs. 15 each and sold them in 11 days with an average sale per day of 15 bottles. Now we need to find out how many bottles were left unsold after 11 days. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of bottles unsold = Total number of bottles x (Number of days - Days sold) / Days sold In our case, the total number of bottles is 264, the number of days is 11, and the number of days sold is 11. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get: Number of bottles unsold = 264 x (11 - 11) / 11 = 0 bottles Therefore, all 264 bottles were sold within the 11-day period.
Response:  We are given that Debi has 301 tanks of kerosene oil and she uses 144 bottles per day. So, in one day, she uses 144 bottles of kerosene oil. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for her to finish all the 301 tanks of kerosene oil. To do this, we can divide the total number of tanks by the number of bottles used per day:  Number of days = Total number of tanks / Number of bottles used per day = 301 / 144 = 2.09 years Therefore, Debi will finish all the 301 tanks of kerosene oil in approximately 2.09 years.
Response:  We have to calculate how many days it will take for Debi to buy 88 tonnes of paddy and sell it at 13 tonnes per day.  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question.  From the question, we can see that the date of purchase is December 20 th, and the date of sale is January 4 th. So, the number of days between these two dates is :  December 20 - January 4 = 26 days  Now, let's calculate how many days Debi will take to buy 88 tonnes of paddy. Since she buys 13 tonnes per day, it will take her : 88 tonnes / 13 tonnes/day = 6.75 days to buy all the paddy.  Finally, let's calculate how much profit Debi will make selling the paddy at 13 tonnes per day. Since she buys 88 tonnes of paddy, she will sell : 88 tonnes x 13 tonnes/day = 1091 tonnes of paddy per day. And since she sells each tonne of paddy at Rs. 1000, her daily profit will be : 1091 tonnes x Rs. 1000/tonne = Rs. 1091000 per day. Therefore, Debi will make a total profit of : 1091000 x 26 days = Rs. 27776000 from selling the paddy.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bottles of oil Debi can buy with Rs. 200 and how much she will pay for each bottle.  From the given information, we know that Debi has Rs. 256 in her account and she wants to buy 312 bottles of oil. So, the cost of one bottle of oil is:

Cost of one bottle = Total amount / Number of bottles
= Rs. 256 / 312
= Rs. 80 per bottle

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take Debi to save enough money to buy all the bottles of oil she needs:

Days taken to save enough money = Total amount / Daily savings
= Rs. 256 / Rs. 80 (per bottle)
= 3 days

So, Debi will need 3 days to save enough money to buy all the bottles of oil she needs."
Response:  Debi has 6 bottles of drinking water per day and each bottle contains 12 tumors. So, in total, she consumes 72 tumors (6 x 12) of water per day. Now, if we want to know how many days it will take for her to consume 120 tumors (which is the cost of 12 bottles), we can divide the total amount of water consumed per day by the number of bottles she wants to buy: 72 tumors / 12 bottles = 6 days. Therefore, it will take Debi 6 days to consume 120 tumors of water.
Response:  We have to calculate how much water is required for Debi's daily needs and how much water she can save per day.  Debi requires 180 liters of water per day, which means she uses 180/2 = 90 liters of water per day. Now, let's find out how much water she can save per day if she replaces 15 liters of water with sodas every day. To do this, we need to divide the amount of water saved (in liters) by the number of days she saves it (in days). So, in this case, Debi can save 15 liters of water per day x 7 days = 105 liters of water per week. Therefore, Debi can save 105 liters of water per week by replacing 15 liters of water with soda every day.
"Response:  Debi has 360 bottles of oil and wants to sell them at Rs. 162 per bottle. If she sells each bottle for Rs. 162, then she will earn total revenue of:

Revenue = Number of bottles sold x Price per bottle
= 360 bottles x Rs. 162 per bottle
= Rs. 57,940
Now, if she spends Rs. 12,200 on transportation costs, her profit will be:
Profit = Revenue - Transportation cost
= Rs. 57,940 - Rs. 12,200
= Rs. 45,740
So, after selling all 360 bottles in one day (which is not possible), she will have a profit of Rs. 45,740."
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are there in total and then divide it by 11. So, let's count the number of pensils first.  There are 14 pencils in total. Now, we need to divide it by 11.  Therefore, the answer is 126 pensils (14 x 11 = 126).
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are there in total and then divide it equally among three pencils. So, firstly we need to calculate the total number of pens. From the given information, we know that there are 12 pens in total. Now, let's divide it equally among three pencils. Since there are 3 pencils, each pencil will get 4 pens (12/3 = 4). Therefore, each pencil will have 4 pens.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pencils are there in total and then divide it by 28 to get the number of pencils per pack.  So, let's calculate the total number of pencils first:

Total number of pencils = 16 + 28 = 44 pencils

Now, we need to divide the total number of pencils by 28 to get the number of pencils per pack:

Number of pencils per pack = 44 / 28 = 1.57 pencils per pack (round off to 1.6 pencils per pack)"
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are there in total and then divide it by 22 to get the number of pens per packet.  So, let's calculate the total number of pens first.  There are 22 packets of pens, and each packet contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens is: 22 x 5 = 110 pens. Now, we need to divide this number by 22 to get the number of pens per packet: 110 / 22 = 5 pens per packet.
Response:  We have to divide 35 into 7 parts of equal size. So we need to find out how many times 35 can be divided by 7.  Can you do that?
Response:  We have 19 pens and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 4 pens. Now, let's calculate how many pens each pen will have if there are 27 different colors of pens available. Each color has 4 pens, so total number of pens for each color is 4 x 27 = 108 pens. Since we have 19 pens in total, each pen will have 19 / 108 = 0.173 pens of each color.
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are there in total and then divide them into seven groups of equal size.  So, we can start with the first group of 36 pens (since each group should contain an equal number of pens). Now, let's count the remaining pens: 30 x 7 = 210 pens. Therefore, there are 246 pens in total (36 + 210).
Response:  We have 11 pens of different colors and each pen has 31 pens inside it. So, in total we have 31 x 11 = 341 pens.
Response:  We have to find out how many paisa (coins) are needed to make 30 taas (handfuls) of panch-pachh (5 coins each). So, we need 30 x 5 = 150 coins in total. Now, there are 64 annas (coins) in one rash (handful), so we need 150 / 64 = 2.34 rashes (handfuls) of coins. Therefore, there will be approximately 2.34 rashes (handfuls) of coins left over after distributing 30 taas (handfuls) among 5 people.
Response:  We have to find out how many pensils are required for each pandit and then multiply it with 6 to get the total number of pensils needed.  So, let's assume that each pandit requires 1 pencil per day (which is a rough estimate).  Therefore, the number of pensils required for each pandit in one week = 7 days x 1 pencil/day = 7 pensils per pandit.  Now, we need to calculate the total number of pensils needed for all the pandits.  Total number of pandits = 6 pandits x 7 pensils/pandit = 42 pensils.  Therefore, the total number of pensils needed is 42 pensils.
"Response:  We have to pack 35 pens in a box of size 35 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm. Since each pen is of size 4 cm x 1 cm x 16 cm, we can fit 35 pens in one box as follows:

| Pen | Box |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Top left corner |
| 2 | Bottom left corner |
| 3 | Middle left side |
| 4 | Middle right side |
| 5 | Bottom right corner |

Now, let's calculate the volume of each pen and total volume of all 35 pens:
Volume of each pen = Length x Width x Height = 4 cm x 1 cm x 16 cm = 64 cubic centimeters (cm³)
Total volume of 35 pens = Volume of first pen + Volume of second pen +... + Volume of thirty-fifth pen = 64 cm³ + 64 cm³ +... + 64 cm³ = 3968 cm³

So, there are 3968 cubic centimeters of space available inside the box for packing the 35 pens."
Response:  We have to find out how many pens are needed for each pack of 31 pens and then calculate the total number of pens required.  Each pack of 31 pens contains 6 pens, so we need 31/6 = 5 packs of 6 pens each. Therefore, the total number of pens required is 5 x 6 = 30 pens.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pens are there in total and then calculate the number of each color pen.  So, let's start with the first part of the question: ""There are 30 pens in total."" Therefore, the total number of pens is 30. Now, let's come to the second part of the question: ""Each pack contains 71 pens."" Since there are 30 packs, the total number of pens in all packs is 30 x 30 = 900 pens. Finally, we need to calculate the number of each color pen: There are 24 red pens, 24 blue pens, 24 green pens, and 24 yellow pens. So, the number of each color pen is: Red - 24, Blue - 24, Green - 24, Yellow - 24."
Response:  We have to arrange 16 pens in a row with each pen having 6 different colors. So, we need to choose 16 unique colors from the total of 21 colors available. The remaining 5 colors can be used for the remaining 4 pens. Therefore, the answer is: 16/21 = 0.76 or approximately 3/4.
Response:  School has 21 classes and 98 students. If each bus can accommodate 7 students, then how many buses are required to transport all the students? Number of buses = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 98 students / 7 students per bus = 14 buses. Therefore, 14 buses are required to transport all the students in this school.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in total and each class has 118 seats. So, the total number of students in all schools is:

Total no. of schools = Number of classes x No. of students per class
= 84 x 118
= 9520

So, there are approximately 9520 students in all schools combined."
Response:  School has 67 classes and each class has 66 students. If there are 6 buses available for transportation, then how many trips can be made in total? To find out, we need to divide the number of students by the capacity of each bus.  Number of students = 66 per class x 67 classes = 4282 students Total number of trips = Number of buses x Capacity of each bus = 6 x 66 = 396 trips So, there will be approximately 396 trips that can be made using the 6 buses provided.
"Response:  School has 87 students and 58 classes. Each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in each bus is:

Number of classes = 58
Number of students per class = 87 / 58 = 1.5
Total number of students in each bus = Number of classes x Number of students per class = 58 x 1.5 = 87
So, there are 2 buses required to transport all the students."
Response:  School has 24 classes and 120 students in total. Since each class has an equal number of students, there are 5 students per class (120/24). Now, since each bus can seat 84 students, we have: Number of buses = Total number of students / Seating capacity of one bus = 120 / 84 = 1.46 buses. So, approximately 1.5 buses are needed to transport all the students from school to their homes.
Response:  We have 66 classes in total and each class has 8 students on average. So, we have 66 x 8 = 504 students in total. Now, if 22 students do not go for their trips, then there will be 504 - 22 = 482 students who will go for their trips. Therefore, the required number of buses is 482 / 8 = 60 buses.
Response:  School has 102 students in total and 11 students are going for the trip. Since each school bus can accommodate only 99 students, if 8 students do not go for the trip, then how many students will be left to travel in the buses of other schools? Therefore, the answer is 3 (8 - 11 = 3).
Response:  School has 72 classes and each class has 30 students. Total number of students in school is 111. Now, if we want to know how many buses are required for transportation, we need to divide total number of students with capacity of each bus. Capacity of each bus is 56 (as there are 30 students per class and 72 classes in total). So, number of buses required = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 111 / 56 = 2.
Response:  School has 17 classes and total number of students is 92. Since there are 46 buses available, each bus can accommodate how many students? To find out, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. So, the answer is: Number of students each bus can accommodate = Total number of students / Number of buses = 92 / 46 = 2 Students per Bus
Response:  We have to find out how many balls each boy has and then add them up.  There are 11 boys in total, so let's start with that number.  Each boy has 9 marbles, except for one boy who has 8 marbles. So, if we multiply 11 by 9, we get 99 marbles. But wait! One boy doesn't have 9 marbles, he has 8. So, we need to subtract 8 from 99, which gives us 91 marbles. Therefore, there are 91 marbles in total among all the boys.
Response:  We have 5 boys and 3 girls in total. Each boy has to give 2 balls to each girl. So, how many balls will each boy give?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of boys (5) with the number of girls (3). Therefore, each boy will give 10 balls (5 x 3 = 15). Now, let's count the number of balls that each girl will receive from all the boys. Since there are 5 boys and 3 girls, each girl will receive 5 x 3 = 15 balls in total.
Response:  There are 4 boys and 3 girls in total. Each boy has to give 23 balls to each girl. So, the total number of balls that each boy needs to give is 23 x 4 = 92 balls. Now, there are 15 balls left with each boy after giving them to the girls. Therefore, the total number of balls that each boy has is 92 - 15 = 77 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls each boy can throw in total and then divide it by 50 to get the average number of throws per boy.  So, let's calculate the total number of balls that all boys together can throw:  Number of balls thrown by 13 boys = 13 x 50 = 650 balls  Now, we need to divide this total number by the number of boys to get the average number of throws per boy:  Average number of throws per boy = Total number of balls / Number of boys = 650 / 13 = 50 So, each boy can throw approximately 50 balls.
Response:  There are 20 boys in class 2A and each boy has 5 marbles. So, there are total 100 marbles (20 boys x 5 marbles/boy). Now, out of these 100 marbles, 30 marbles have been taken away by Helik. So, now there are 70 marbles left (100 - 30 = 70). Since there are 20 boys in class 2A, each boy will get 3.5 marbles (70 / 20 = 3.5) as their share. Therefore, the answer is 3.5.
Response:  We have to find out how many bulbs are needed for each child to play with and then multiply it by the number of children.  So, let's assume that each child needs 3 bulbs to play with (as mentioned in the question). Now, there are 28 children playing together. Therefore, we need 28 x 3 = 84 bulbs in total for all the children to play with.
Response:  We know that Frank reads his favorite book for 14 pages every day. So, in total, he will read 392 pages of the book in one month (30 days). Now, let's calculate how many months it will take him to finish reading the entire book of 568 pages.  We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages Frank reads per day: 392 pages / 14 pages/day = 27 days Therefore, Frank will need 27 days to finish reading the entire book of 568 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank reads his favorite book for 2 hours and 29 minutes every day. So, in total, he spends 569 days reading his favorite book. Now, let's calculate how many pages he has read so far. If he reads 20 pages per hour, then he has read (569 x 20) = 11380 pages of his favorite book till now.
Response:  We know that Frank has to read his favorite book for 6 days in total. If he reads one chapter per day, then he will finish reading the entire book in 6 days. So, on the seventh day, he won't be able to read any more chapters of the book. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 7 days.
Response:  The book has 555 pages and Frank reads 8 pages per day. To find out how many days it will take him to read the entire book, we can use the formula: Number of days = Total number of pages / Reading speed per day So, in this case, the total number of pages is 555, and Frank reads at a pace of 8 pages per day, so the number of days it will take him to read the entire book is: Number of days = 555 / 8 = 71.875 days Approximately 72 days.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 193 days and completed 15 chapters. Since each chapter has 4 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 15 x 4 = 60 pages Now, we are asked how many days it would take Frank to read one chapter. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days Frank spent reading: Days taken to read one chapter = Total number of pages / Number of days spent reading = 60 / 193 = 0.30 days So, if Frank reads one chapter every day, it will take him approximately 0.30 days or 18 minutes to complete one chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 249 pages in each pothee and it takes 3 days to read one pothee. So, total number of days required to read all 249 pothees is = 3 x 249 = 747 days. Now, let's calculate how many pages can be read in one day. Since we have 747 days, so total number of pages that can be read in one day is = 747 / 3 = 249 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that each pot contains 66 pages and there are 12 pots in total. So, the total number of pages in all pots is:

66 x 12 = 792 pages

Now, we are asked how many days it would take to read all these pages if each pot takes 12 days to finish reading. Therefore, the total number of days required to read all the pages is:

792 pages / 12 days per pot = 65.17 days (approximately)"
Response:  We are given that Frank can read his favorite book for 16 days continuously. If there are 112 pages in the book, then we need to find out how many pages he can read in one day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days he can read the book: Number of pages Frank can read in one day = Total number of pages / Number of days he can read the book = 112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages per day Now, if Frank reads one page every day, it will take him 112 days to finish reading the entire book. So, the answer is (112 days).
Response:  We are given that Frank likes to read his favorite book for 8 hours every day.  There are 576 pages in the book. To find out how many days it will take to finish reading the entire book, we can divide the number of pages by the time he spends reading per day: Number of days = Number of pages / Time spent reading per day = 576 pages / 8 hours/day = 72 days So, it will take Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book entirely if he continues reading at this rate.
Response:  We know that Frank has to read his favorite book of 450 pages in 30 days. So, he needs to read approximately 15 pages per day (450 pages / 30 days = 15 pages/day). Now, let's assume that Frank reads for exactly one hour every day. Therefore, he will cover a distance of 15 pages x 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes in a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, Frank will cover a total distance of 900 minutes/24 hours = 37.5 pages per day. So, in one day, Frank will cover approximately 37.5 pages of his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 607 days and there are 594 pages in the book. So, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 594, and the number of days taken to read the book is 607. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per day is: Number of pages read per day = 594 / 607 = 0.98 pages/day Now, let's convert this value to a decimal format: Number of pages read per day (decimal) = 0.98 = 0.98 Decimal value represents how many pages Frank read per day.
Response:  We know that Frank has to read his favorite book for 664 days. Since there are 2 chapters in the book and each chapter contains 405 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank needs to read as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Total number of chapters = 2 Chapters per chapter = 405 pages/chapter Total number of pages = 2 x 405 = 810 pages Now, since Frank has to read the entire book in 664 days, he will have to read an average of pages per day. So, the answer is 810 pages.
Response:  We have to find out how much kilogram of rice can be purchased with $120 in package 6 of Divya Bhaskar. To do this, we need to divide the amount of money ($120) by the price per packet (in dollars). So, the calculation is as follows: $120 / $1 = $120 per packet Now, we know that Package 6 contains 12 packets of rice. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing all the packages would be: $120 x 12 = $1440 Now, since you want to know how many kilograms of rice you can buy with $1440, let's convert the price from dollars to rupees using the current exchange rate (as of today): $1 = Rs.70 So, $1440 / Rs.70 = Rs.20,000 approximately This means that with $1440, you can purchase around 20 kilograms of rice.
Response:  We have to calculate how much money will be saved if we buy 33 DVDs instead of 81 DVDs at $81 each. So, let's do the calculation: Total cost of buying 81 DVDs = 81 x 81 = $6,578 Total cost of buying 33 DVDs = 33 x $81 = $2,693 Now, the difference in cost between buying 81 and 33 DVDs is: Difference = $6,578 - $2,693 = $3,885 Therefore, by buying 33 DVDs instead of 81 DVDs, you will save $3,885.
Response:  We have to find out how much discount is available in each pack of DeviDici and then calculate the total cost of buying all the packets.  The price of one DeviDici packet is $107, and there is a discount of $10 per pack. So, the price of each pack after discount is $97 ($107 - $10). Now, we need to buy 5 packets of DeviDici, so the total cost will be 5 x $97 = $485. Therefore, you can buy 5 packets of DeviDici for $485.
Response:  We have to calculate how much money each DVD costs and then find out how many DVDs can be bought with the given amount of discount.  So, let's start by calculating the cost of one DVD: $76 / 1 = $76 per DVD. Now, we know that there is a discount of $25 on each pack of 4 DVDs. So, if we buy 4 DVDs together, we will get a discount of $25 x 4 = $100. Therefore, the total cost of buying 4 DVDs together would be $76 + $100 = $176. Now, let's check whether we can buy all 8 DVDs or not: $176 / $25 = 7 DVDs. Yes, we can buy 7 DVDs with the given discount.
Response:  We have to buy $104 worth of DVDs at $26 each. So, we need to know how many DVDs can be bought with that amount. To find out, divide $104 by $26: $$ \frac {104}{26} = 4 $$ Therefore, you can buy 4 DVDs with $104.
Response:  We have to buy two packages of DVDs worth $28 each. So, we will spend $56 for both packages. Now, if we get one package free, then we will save $56 / 2 = $28. Therefore, we can buy two packages of DVDs worth $28 each and get one package free, which means saving $28.

Response:  We have 140 people in a hall with an area of 187 square meters. To find out how many people can fit in the hall, we need to divide the area of the hall by the area of each person. So, Area per Person = Hall Area / Number of People = 187 sqm / 140 ppl = 1352.69 sqft (approximately) Therefore, approximately 1352.69 square feet can fit in the hall with 140 people.
Response:  We have 203 balls in total and we want to distribute them equally among 6 groups of 7 people each. So, each group will get 28 balls (203 / 6 = 33). Now, let's assume that there are 95 people in total who will be divided into 10 groups of 9 people each. Each group will get 9 balls (95 / 10 = 9). Therefore, each person will get 28 + 9 = 37 balls in total.
"Response:  We have 142 teams in total and we want to divide them into 47 groups of 356 members each. To do this, we need to find out how many members are required for each group.  So, the number of members per group is:

142 teams x 356 members/group = 47 x 356 = 16,092 members

Now, let's see how many members will be left over after dividing all the teams into groups:

16,092 members - (47 x 356) = 16,092 - 16,092 = 0 members

So, there will be no members left over after dividing all the teams into groups of 356 members each."
Response:  We have to find out how many members are there in each group of 196 people and then sum up all these numbers. So, we can start with the first group of 39 people and calculate their average age as follows: Average Age = Total Number of People / Group Size In this case, the total number of people is 196, and the group size is 39, so the average age of the first group is: $ \boxed{58.70 years} $ Now, let's move on to the next group of 42 people and repeat the calculation: Average Age = Total Number of People / Group Size In this case, the total number of people is 196, and the group size is 42, so the average age of the second group is: $ \boxed{45.71 years} $ We continue this process for all groups, calculating the average age of each group separately. Here are the calculations for all 19 groups: Group 1: $ \boxed{58.70 years} $ Group 2: $ \boxed{45.71 years} $ Group 3: $ \boxed{48.57 years} $ Group 4: $ \boxed{46.30 years} $ Group 5: $ \boxed{44.60 years} $ Group 6: $ \boxed{43.50 years} $ Group 7: $ \boxed{42.40 years} $ Group 8: $ \boxed{41.30 years} $ Group 9: $ \boxed{40.20 years} $ Group 10: $ \boxed{39.10 years} $ Group 11: $ \boxed{38.00 years} $ Group 12: $ \boxed{36.90 years} $ Group 13: $ \boxed{35.80 years} $ Group 14: $ \boxed{34.70 years} $ Group 15: $ \boxed{33.60 years} $ Group 16: $ \boxed{32.50 years} $ Group 17: $ \

Response:  If there are 87 tulips in one pot and each pot contains 29 tulips, then there will be 3 pots with 87 tulips in total. Now, if we divide these 87 tulips equally among 10 pots, each pot will contain 87/10 = 8 tulips. So, the number of tulips in each pot is 8.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 384 can be divided into 192 without leaving any remainder.  To do this, we need to divide both numbers and see if the result is less than or equal to 16.  If it is less than 16, then we know that 384 cannot be divided into 192 exactly, so there will always be some remaining amount.  Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 38 liters.  To do this, we need to know the volume of one cup of water.  In India, the standard size of a cup is 200 ml. So, if we want to convert liters to cups, we can use the following conversion factor: 1 liter = 4 cups (or 200 ml). Therefore, to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 38 liters, we can divide 38 liters by 4 cups per liter: 38 liters / 4 cups/liter = 9.5 cups. So, there are approximately 9.5 cups of water required to fill up 38 liters.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 14 goes into 30 and then multiply it with 25. So, we need to divide 30 by 14 which gives us 2.14. Now, if we multiply 2.14 with 25, we get 53.5. Therefore, the answer is 53.5.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 22 liters in 17 containers of 1 liter each. To do this, we need to divide 22 liters by 17 containers. So, the number of cups of water required is:

22 liters / 17 containers = 1.30 cups (approximately)"
Response:  We have to find out how many times 10 gots can be divided into 9 equal parts.  So, we need to divide 10 by 9.  When we divide 10 by 9, we get 1 with remainder 1.  Therefore, there are 11 parts (10 + 1 = 11).
Response:  We are given that Brahma made 14 cups of kukri and distributed them equally among 5 people. So, each person got 2-1/2 cups of kukri. Now, we need to find out how many cups of kukri each person got. To do this, we can divide the total number of cups (14) by the number of people (5). Therefore, each person got 2-1/2 cups of kukri / 5 = 0.4 cups of kukri per person.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required for each guest and then multiply it with the total number of guests to get the total amount of water needed.  So, let's start by finding out how much water is required for one guest.  According to the question, each guest requires 2 liters of water.  Therefore, the total amount of water required for 10 guests would be: 10 x 2 = 20 liters.
Response:  We have 42 bags of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 4.2 bags of rice ( rounded off to two decimal places).
Response:  We have to find out how many chocolates Frank has in total and then calculate what percentage of them are broken.  So, let's start with finding out how many chocolates Frank has in total. According to the question, Frank has 33 chocolates in all. Now, we need to find out how many of them are broken. The question says that 26 of them are broken, which means that 9 (26/3) chocolates are broken. Therefore, Frank has 33 - 9 = 24 unbroken chocolates. So, the percentage of broken chocolates is 9/24 x 100 = 375%.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags Frank can carry in total and then divide it by 33 to get the number of bags he can carry per trip.  So, let's calculate the total number of bags Frank can carry:  Number of bags = Total weight of bags / Weight of each bag  In this case, the total weight of bags is 33 x 24 = 768 kg (since there are 33 bags with a weight of 24 kg each). Now, we need to divide the total weight by the weight of each bag to get the number of bags Frank can carry per trip: Number of bags per trip = Total weight of bags / Weight of each bag  Number of bags per trip = 768 kg / 24 kg = 31.5 bags per trip Since Frank can carry only whole numbers of bags, round up the result to 32 bags per trip. Therefore, Frank can carry 32 bags per trip.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of chocolates Frank has in total and then calculate how much he will get if each bag contains 11 tricks.  So, let's assume that Frank has x bags of chocolates. Since there are 22 tricks in each bag, the total number of tricks Frank has is 22x. Now, we need to find out what fraction of the total tricks Frank will get if each bag contains 11 tricks. To do this, we can divide the number of tricks Frank gets (11x) by the total number of tricks he has (22x). Therefore, the fraction of tricks Frank will get is 11/22.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of chocolates Frank has given to each person in the group. Since there are 16 people in the group, and each bag contains 30 pieces of chocolate, we can calculate as follows: Number of bags = Total number of pieces of chocolate / Number of people in the group x Number of pieces per bag So, the total number of bags is: Number of bags = 16 x 30 / 16 = 2 bags Therefore, Frank has given 2 bags of chocolates to each person in the group.
"Response:  We have to find out how many boxes of 14 kg each can be packed in 25 boxes of size 30 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm.

Step 1: Calculate the total volume of all the boxes that can be packed.
Volume = Length x Width x Height = 30 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm = 600 cubic centimeters (cm³)

Step 2: Divide the total volume by the volume of one box to get the number of boxes that can be packed.
Number of boxes = Total volume / Volume of one box = 600 cm³ / 14 kg/box = approximately 42.86 boxes

So, we can pack approximately 42.86 boxes of 14 kg each in 25 boxes of size 30 cm x 20 cm x 10 cm."
Response:  We have 10 boxes of chocolates and we want to distribute them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 2 boxes of chocolates. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 diet sodas in total. If we take away 9 diet sodas from the total number of bottles, then how many regular sodas will be left? So, the answer is 58 (67 - 9 = 58).
Response:  We have 22 bottles of soft drink in the store and we sold 61 bottles. So, if we want to know how many bottles of diet soda were sold, we can subtract the number of bottles of regular soda sold from the total number of bottles available in the store. Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda sold is: 61 - 22 = 39 bottles.
Response:  We have 30 bottles of kerosene in one store and we sold 8 bottles of diesel from that same store. Now, there are 22 bottles of kerosene left (30 - 8 = 22). So, if we sell 41 seeds from that remaining stock of kerosene, then the number of bottles of kerosene left will be: Number of bottles of kerosene left = Total number of bottles of kerosene available for sale - Number of bottles of diesel sold = 22 - 41 = -19 bottles. Therefore, there are -19 bottles of kerosene left in the store after selling 41 seeds.
"Response:  We have 79 bottles of soft drink in total. If we sell 53 bottles at Rs.42 each, then our revenue will be:
R = 53 x 42 = Rs.2186
Now, let's find out how much profit we made selling those bottles:
P = R - C
where C is the cost price of one bottle. Since we don't know the exact cost price of one bottle, let's assume it to be Rs.20 (just for simplicity).
So, P = R - 20 = Rs.2186 - Rs.20 = Rs.2166
Therefore, the profit made from selling those 53 bottles is Rs.2166. Now, let's calculate the number of bottles that can be sold with the remaining amount of money:
N = A / P
where A is the remaining amount of money and P is the profit made.
A = Rs.2186 - Rs.2166 = Rs.200
N = A / P = Rs.200 / Rs.2166 = 9
So, we can sell approximately 9 bottles more with the remaining amount of money."
Response:  We have 54 bottles of diet soda in one store and 83 bottles of regular soda in another store. If we want to mix them equally, how many bottles will each type contain after mixing?  To find out, let's divide the total number of bottles (137) by 2 (the number of types of soda). So, each type of soda will contain 68.5 bottles (137 / 2 = 68.5). Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there will be 69 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda after mixing them equally.
Response:  We have 17 bottles of kerosene in total and we want to fill 9 bottles with diesel oil. So, we will have 8 bottles left over after filling them with diesel oil. Now, let's calculate how much diesel oil is required to fill each bottle. Since there are 29 tomatoes in one seb (a unit of measurement), we can calculate that amount as follows: Number of bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles filled with diesel oil = 17 - 9 = 8 Number of tomatoes per bottle = Number of sebs / Number of bottles = 29 / 8 = 4 sebs Therefore, we need 4 sebs of diesel oil to fill each bottle.
Response:  We have 19 bottles of diet soda and we want to fill 60 bottles with normal soda. So, we need to calculate how many times we can fill each bottle of diet soda with normal soda.  Since there are 19 bottles of diet soda, we can fill them with normal soda 60/19 = 3 times. Therefore, we will be able to fill 3 x 19 = 57 bottles of normal soda.
Response:  We have 72 bottles of oil in total and we need to fill 32 bottles with diesel. So, we will have 40 bottles left over after filling the diesel bottles. Now, each bottle contains 78 tablespoons of oil, so we can calculate the number of tablespoons left over as follows: Number of tablespoons = Total amount of oil - Amount filled into diesel bottles x Tablespoons per bottle Total amount of oil = 72 x 78 = 5664 tablespoons Amount filled into diesel bottles = 32 x 78 = 2592 tablespoons Therefore, there are 3072 tablespoons of oil left over (5664 - 2592).
"Response:  We have:

* 36 tonnes of sugar in one store (S1)
* 80 tonnes of salt in another store (S2)
* 54 tonnes of diet soda in yet another store (S3)

Now, we need to find out how many bottles each type of item can fill. Let's assume that:

* One tonne of sugar is equal to 1000 bottles (based on average weight of a bottle and volume of sugar)
* One tonne of salt is equal to 800 bottles (based on average weight of a bottle and volume of salt)
* One tonne of diet soda is equal to 700 bottles (based on average weight of a bottle and volume of diet soda)

Using these assumptions, let's calculate the number of bottles each store has:

Store S1: 36 tonnes x 1000 bottles/tonne = 36,000 bottles
Store S2: 80 tonnes x 800 bottles/tonne = 64,000 bottles
Store S3: 54 tonnes x 700 bottles/tonne = 39,000 bottles

So, there are approximately 36,000 bottles of sugar, 64,000 bottles of salt, and 39,000 bottles of diet soda in total across all three stores."
Response:  We have 30 bottles of oil and we want to fill 28 bottles with diesel. So, we will have 2 extra bottles of diesel left over after filling all the bottles. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have 4 bottles of diet soda and each bottle contains 79 milliliters. So, in total, we have 4 x 79 = 316 milliliters of diet soda. Now, if all four bottles are filled to the brim (i.e., completely full), then the total volume of diet soda is 316 milliliters / 4 = 79 milliliters per bottle. Therefore, there will be 79 milliliters of diet soda in each of the 4 bottles.
Response:  We have 57 bottles of oil in total. Out of that, 26 bottles are diet oil and 31 bottles are regular oil. So, the number of bottles of regular oil is 31. Therefore, the total number of bottles of all types of oil is 57 + 31 = 88 bottles.
"Response:  We have 81 bottles of soft drink in total.  If we sell 60 bottles at Rs. 25 each, then our revenue will be:

R = 60 x 25 = Rs. 1500

Now, if we subtract the cost price of the remaining 21 bottles (which is equal to 21 x Rs. 25), we get:

C = 21 x 25 = Rs. 525

So, our profit is:

P = R - C = Rs. 975

Now, let's find out how many bottles of diet soda are left after selling 60 bottles of regular soda. Since we sold 60 bottles of regular soda, and there were initially 81 bottles, the number of bottles of diet soda left is:

D = 81 - 60 = 21

Therefore, the answer is:

P = Rs. 975
D = 21"
"Response:  We have 49 bottles of oil in total. If we sell 40 bottles at Rs. 60 each, then our total revenue will be:

R = 40 x 60 = 2400

Now, if we subtract the cost price of the remaining 9 bottles (which is equal to 9 x Rs. 60 = 540), then we get:

Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Price = 2400 - 540 = 1860

So, there are 6 bottles of light left after selling all the other bottles."
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and April together (31 + 30 = 61). So, if we subtract the number of days passed since the last day of March from the total number of days in April, we get: 61 - 29 = 32 days. Therefore, there are 32 days left in April after considering the time period given in the question.
Response:  We know that Bhogank has 73 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, there are total 1807 hours (73 x 24) in a year of Bhogank. Now, we need to find out how many hours are left after subtracting the number of days spent eating from the total number of hours in a year. Therefore, if Bhogank spends 25 days eating, then he will have 1807 - 25 = 1782 hours remaining for other activities during the rest of the year.
Response:  The question is asking about how many days it took for the bread to become stale after being baked in an oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). We are given that the bread was baked for 10 hours and then left out to cool. To find out how long it took for the bread to become stale, we need to use some basic math. If the bread was baked for 10 hours, that means it spent 1/2 of its total time in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). So, if the bread took 10 hours to bake, it will take half that time (or 5 hours) to become stale. Therefore, the bread became stale after 5 hours of being baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).
"Response:  We know that there are 132 guests at the hotel and they have been staying for 32 days. So, the total number of days they have stayed is:

132 guests x 32 days = 4064 days

Now, we need to find out how many tourists visited the hotel in the previous day. According to the question, if 406 locals visited the hotel in one day, then the number of tourists who visited the hotel in the previous day can be calculated as follows:

Number of tourists in the previous day = Number of locals visiting the hotel in one day x Total number of days they have stayed
= 406 x (4064 - 327)
= 406 x 937
= 37580

Therefore, the number of tourists who visited the hotel in the previous day was 37580."
"Response:  We know that there are 829 houses in the village and each house has an average of 4.5 people per household. So, the total population of the village is:

829 houses x 4.5 people/household = 3671 people

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for all the tourists to visit every house in the village. We know that there are 85 days left in the year after the festival ends, so let's calculate the number of visitors per day:

Total number of visitors = Total population of the village / Number of days left in the year
= 3671 people / 85 days = 43 people/day

So, if 43 people visit the village every day during the remaining 85 days of the year, they will be able to see all the 829 houses in the village."
"Response:  We know that there are 71 tikas (drawings) in the Bakinigham Mahal and it took 557 days for them to complete it. Now we have to find out how many days it would take to complete 188 tikas.  If they completed 57 tikas in 557 days, then the number of tikas they completed per day is:

$$ \frac {57}{557} = 0.103 $$

So, it would take $103$ days to complete $188$ tikas."
"Response:  We know that there are 39 trees in the garden and each tree has 661 branches. So, the total number of branches in the garden is:

39 x 661 = 27591

Now, we need to calculate the number of visitors who came to the garden yesterday. The question states that there were 661 visitors yesterday, so the number of visitors per branch is:

27591 / 661 = 40.8

So, approximately 40.8 visitors came to the garden yesterday for every branch."
Response:  We know that there are 92 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a year is: 92 x 24 = 2168 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Bhonjan took to build his house. According to the question, he built it in 419 days, so the number of hours he worked per day is: 419 / 24 = 17 hours per day. Therefore, the total number of hours Bhonjan spent building his house is: 17 hours/day x 419 days = 6,593 hours.
"Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year (not including leap years), so if today is March 5th, then yesterday was February 4th. Therefore, the number of bags of wheat sold during the last 512 days would be:

$$ \text {Number of bags of wheat sold} = \frac{808}{365} - \frac{471}{365} $$

Simplifying and solving for $\text {number of bags of wheat sold}$, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text {Number of bags of wheat sold}} = 236 $$

Therefore, there were $236$ bags of wheat sold during the last $512$ days."
Response:  We know that there are 365 days in a year (not including leap years), so we can assume that Bhogankumar has been alive for exactly one year. Therefore, he was born on February 28th or March 1st of last year. Now let's calculate how many days have passed since his birth:  From February 28th or March 1st to July 7th is 191 days. So far, Bhogankumar has lived for 191 days.  From July 7th to October 4th is 134 days (134 x 3 = 398 days). In total, Bhogankumar has lived for 398 days from his birth until October 4th. Finally, from October 4th to December 24th is 103 days (103 x 3 = 309 days). In conclusion, Bhogankumar has lived for exactly 309 days from his birth until December 24th.
"Response:  We have to find out how many grams of moom are required for 159 gms of moom in total. So, we need to divide 159 gms by 628 gms (total amount of moom). Therefore, the answer is:

$$ \frac{159}{628} = 0.247 $$

So, there are $ 0.247$ grams of moom required for every gram of moom in total."
Response:  We have to find out how much moisture is required for each type of rice and then calculate the total amount of moisture needed.  For Basmati Rice, we need 15-20% moisture content in the grains. So, if we take an average of 17.5%, we need 49 grams of moisture per 100 grams of Basmati Rice.  Similarly, for Non-Basmati Rice, we need 10-12% moisture content in the grains. So, if we take an average of 11%, we need 260 grams of moisture per 100 grams of Non-Basmati Rice. Therefore, the difference between the two types of rice is 211 grams (260 - 49 = 211).
Response:  We know that there are 57 grams of rice and we need to find out how many grams of moong are required to make it equal to 22 grams of moom. So, we can start with the ratio of rice to moong as follows: Rice : Moong = 57 : x (where x is the number of grams of moong needed) Now, we know that Hunka wants to add 22 grams of moom to the mixture, so we can write an equation based on this information: 57 + x = 22 + 22 (since he already has 22 grams of moom) Simplifying the above equation, we get: x = 19 grams Therefore, Hunka needs 19 grams of moong to make the mixture equal to 22 grams of moom.
"Response:  We have to find out how much more or less than 166 grams of sugar is required to make 20 grams of sugar. So we need to subtract 20 grams from 166 grams. Therefore, the answer is:

166 - 20 = 146 grams"
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of momo are required to make 557 grams of momo mixture. So, we need to divide 557 grams by 17 grams (which is the weight of one momo). Therefore, the number of momo required = 557 / 17 = 32.8.
Response:  If Okra weighs 11 grams per piece and there are 4 pieces of okra in total, then the weight of okra is: 4 x 11 = 44 grams. So, the total weight of all the ingredients including okra is: 44 + 150 = 194 grams.
Response:  We know that there are 94 days left for Anant to reach his final destination. Since he has already walked for 6 days, in the next 88 days (i.e., from day 7 to day 94), he will walk for 88 \* 2 = 176 days. So, in total, Anant will walk for 6 + 176 = 182 days.
"Response:  We are given that there are 266 trees in the orchard and each tree bears 90 mangoes per day. So, the total number of mangoes produced by all the trees in one day is:

266 trees x 90 mangoes/tree/day = 23840 mangoes/day

Now, we are asked how many days it takes for all the mangoes to ripen. We know that there are 266 days in a year, so the number of days it takes for all the mangoes to ripen is:

23840 mangoes/day x 266 days = 657120 mangoes

So, after 266 days, all the mangoes in the orchard will have ripened."
Response:  We are given that there are 294 days in a year and Omar takes 146 days to dig one well. So, he can dig 244 wells in a year (294 days / 146 days per well = 244 wells).
"Response:  We are given that there are 235 days in a year and Omar takes 77 days to fill his barrel with water. So, we need to find out how many times Omar can fill his barrel with water in a year. Therefore, we divide the number of days taken by Omar to fill his barrel (77) by the number of days in a year (235):

$$ \frac {77} {235} = 0.321 $$

So, Omar can fill his barrel with water approximately $321$ times in a year."
Response:  We are given that Oapn has 57 stones and he wants to make 252 steps. So, in each step, he will have to move 252/57 = 4.36 stones. Now, we are also given that he takes 108 steps in total. Therefore, the number of times he moves his stone is 108 / 4.36 = 252. Hence, Angurak can move his stone 252 times in 58 days.
Response:  We are given that there are 36 working days in a month and each day an average of 240 lotas (a unit of measurement) of angur is produced. So, total production per month = Total production per day x Number of working days per month = 240 lotas/day x 36 working days/month = 8,640 lotas/month.
Response:  We have to find out how many grams of salt are present in 26 tonnes of water.  One tonne is equal to 1000 kilograms, so 26 tonnes means 26 x 1000 = 26,000 kilograms of water. Now, we know that one gram of salt dissolves in 1 litre of water, so to find out how much salt is present in 26,000 kilograms of water, we need to divide it by 1000 (as there are 1000 millilitres in 1 litre). Therefore, the number of grams of salt present in 26,000 kilograms of water is 26,000 / 1000 = 26,000 grams. So, there are 26,000 grams of salt in 26 tonnes of water.
"Response:  We have to find out how many animals are there in each enclosure and then sum them up.  There are 40 tanks in total, and each tank can hold 2 animals. So, the total number of animals we have is:

Total number of animals = Number of tanks x Capacity of each tank
= 40 x 2
= 80 animals

So, there are 80 animals in all the enclosures combined."
Response:  We have to find out how much water is required for 56 tonnes of namkeen (a type of snack) and then calculate how many trays are needed to pack it.  Firstly, we need to convert the weight of namkeen from tonnes to kilograms. There are 1000 kg in one tonne, so 56 tonnes = 56 x 1000 = 56,000 kg. Now, let's assume that each tray can hold approximately 39 kg of namkeen (based on the given information). Therefore, to pack 56,000 kg of namkeen, we will need 56,000 / 39 = 1427 trays.
Response:  We have to find out how many trays of namkeen (dried fish) are required to fill up 22 liters of water in each tray.  Firstly, we need to calculate the volume of one tray of namkeen. According to the question, each tray contains 46 pieces of dried fish, and each piece is approximately 10 grams in weight. Therefore, the total weight of one tray of namkeen = 46 x 10 g = 460 grams. Now, we know that 1 liter of water weighs 1000 grams, so we can convert the volume of water in liters to grams by dividing it by 1000: 22 L / 1000 = 22,000 grams. Since there are 460 grams of namkeen in one tray, we can divide the total weight of water by the weight of one tray of namkeen to get an estimate of how many trays of namkeen are needed to fill up 22 liters of water: 22,000 grams / 460 grams per tray = 48.75 trays. So, approximately 49 trays of namkeen are needed to fill up 22 liters of water.
"Response:  We have to find out how many animals are there in total and then calculate the average weight of each animal.  So, let's start with the given information:

* Number of animals = 15 + 62 = 77
* Average weight of each animal = 19 tonnes (as mentioned in the question)

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of all the animals together:
Total weight of animals = Number of animals x Average weight of each animal
= 77 x 19
= 1433 tonnes

So, there are 77 animals in total, and their average weight is approximately 19 tonnes."
Response:  We have to buy 13 t-shirts in total. The pack of 39 t-shirts contains 3 packets of 13 t-shirts each. So, we need 3 packets of t-shirts. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have to buy 66 t-shirts in total and each package contains 3 t-shirts. So, we need 21 packages of t-shirts (66 / 3 = 21).
Response:  We are given that there are 28 packets of t-shirts and each packet contains 5 shirts. So, in total, we have 28 x 5 = 140 t-shirts.
Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of t-shirts Mom has bought in total. According to the question, Mom has bought 57 t-shirts and packed them into 34 packets. So, we can calculate the number of t-shirts per packet as follows: Number of t-shirts per packet = Total number of t-shirts / Number of packets = 57 / 34 = 1.67 t-shirts per packet Now, let's assume that Safed T-Shirt is equal to 1 t-shirt. Therefore, the total number of Safed T-Shirts that Mom has bought is: Total number of Safed T-Shirts = Number of t-shirts per packet x Number of packets = 1.67 x 34 = 55 Safed T-Shirts Hence, the correct answer is 55 Safed T-Shirts.
Response:  The mother has bought 51 t-shirts and wants to know how many packets of three t-shirts each she can buy with the remaining money.  We have Rs. 30 left after buying 51 t-shirts. To find out how many packets of three t-shirts each we can buy, we need to divide the remaining amount (Rs. 30) by the cost of one packet of three t-shirts (Rs. 27). So, we can buy 3 / 27 = 0.11 packets of three t-shirts each with the remaining money.
Response:  We know that the mother has bought 70 t-shirts and wants to divide them equally among her 4 children. So, each child will get 17.5 t-shirts (70/4 = 17.5). Now, we need to find out how many packets of t-shirts each child will get from one packet containing 4 t-shirts. To do this, we divide 17.5 by 4, which gives us 4.38 (17.5 / 4 = 4.38). Since we can't have a fraction of a packet, we round off the result to the nearest whole number, which is 4 packets (4.38 rounded up to the nearest whole number = 4). Therefore, each child will get 4 packets of t-shirts.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice are needed for 4 tonnes of rice and then multiply it by 36 to get the total number of bags required.

So, let's convert 4 tonnes to kilograms:

1 tone = 1000 kg

Therefore, 4 tonnes = 4 x 1000 = 4000 kg

Now, we know that each bag of rice weighs 50 kg, so we can calculate the number of bags needed:

Number of bags = Total weight of rice / Weight of one bag
= 4000 kg / 50 kg/bag
= 80 bags

Finally, we need to multiply the number of bags by 36 to get the total number of bags required:

Total number of bags = Number of bags x Number of bags per month
= 80 bags x 36 bags/month
= 2880 bags

So, there will be 2880 bags of rice needed to store 4 tonnes of rice for 36 months."
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 33 liters.  To do this, we need to know the volume of one cup of water.  The volume of one cup of water is equal to 250 milliliters (mL). So, to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 33 liters, we can divide 33 liters by 250 mL.  Therefore, there are 132 cups of water required to fill up 33 liters.
Response:  We know that there are 41 tonnes of coal in each borewell and we have to calculate how many borewells will be required to extract 53 tonnes of coal. So, firstly, we need to divide the total amount of coal (in tonnes) by the amount of coal in each borewell (in tonnes). This gives us: Number of borewells = Total amount of coal / Amount of coal in each borewell = 53 tonnes / 41 tonnes = 1.29 borewells Now, since we cannot have fractional borewells, we round off the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of borewells required to extract 53 tonnes of coal is 1 borewell.
Response:  We have 14 bags of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 7 bags of wheat. So, we will divide 14 by 7 = 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 21 tons of kukri jute bags.  Firstly, we need to convert the weight of kukri jute bags from tons to kilograms.  One ton is equal to 1000 kg, so 21 tons is equal to 21,000 kg.  Next, we need to calculate how much space each bag occupies in terms of volume.  The volume of one kukri jute bag is approximately 3 cubic feet or 0.09 m3.  Therefore, to calculate the total volume of 21 tons of kukri jute bags, we can multiply the number of bags by their volume:  Volume of 21 tons of kukri jute bags = Number of bags x Volume of one bag = 21,000 kg / 0.09 m3 = 233,333 cubic feet or 6875 cubic meters.  Now, we know that one cup of water is equivalent to 0.034 cubic meters.  So, to find out how many cups of water are required to fill up 21 tons of kukri jute bags, we can divide the total volume of the bags by the volume of one cup:  Cups of water required to fill up 21 tons of kukri jute bags = Total volume of bags / Volume of one cup = 6875 cubic meters / 0.034 cubic meters = 196,583 cups.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice Ahan has and how much weight each bag contains.  From the given information, we know that Ahan has 26 bags of rice, and each bag weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the bags of rice Ahan has is:

$$ \text {Total weight of rice} = \text {Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} $$

$$ \therefore \text {Total weight of rice} = 26 \times 50 = 1300 \text {kg} $$

Now, we are asked how much weight Kukiji has in his bag. Since he has 15 bags of rice, and each bag weighs 50 kg, the total weight of all the bags of rice Kukiji has is:

$$ \text {Total weight of rice} = \text {Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} $$

$$ \therefore \text {Total weight of rice} = 15 \times 50 = 750 \text {kg} $$

Finally, we need to subtract the weight of rice that Ahan has from the weight of rice that Kukiji has to find out how much weight Kukiji has left after giving some to Ahan. So, the difference between the total weight of rice that Kukiji has and the weight of rice that Ahan took from him is:

$$ \text {Difference} = \text {Total weight of rice} - (\text {Total weight of rice} \div 2) $$

$$ \therefore \text {Difference} = 1300 - (1300 / 2) = 650 \text {kg} $$

Therefore, Kukiji has $650$ kg of weight left after giving some to Ahan."
"Response:  We have 28 bags of rice and we want to distribute them equally among 86 people. So, each person will get:

Number of bags per person = Total number of bags / Number of people
= 28 / 86
= 0.327 (or approximately 32.7 bags per person)"
Response:  We have to find out how many houses are there in each block and then calculate the total number of houses in all blocks.  So, let's start with the first block:  There are 5 tankers of water in each block, so there will be 5 x 5 = 25 tanks of water in this block. Now, we know that each house gets 25 tanks of water, so there are 25 / 25 = 1 house in this block. Similarly, for the second block, there are 5 tankers of water in each block, so there will be 5 x 6 = 30 tanks of water in this block. And since each house gets 25 tanks of water, there are 30 / 25 = 2 houses in this block. Therefore, there is one house in the first block and two houses in the second block.
Response:  We have to divide 90 tonnes of junk among 20 blocks in each house. So, we need to calculate how much junk can be placed in one block.  One block has a volume of 5 cubic meters (as given in the question). Therefore, we can place 90/5 = 18 tonnes of junk in one block. Since there are 20 blocks in each house, we can place 18 x 20 = 360 tonnes of junk in each house. Now, since there are 10 houses, we can place 360 x 10 = 3600 tonnes of junk altogether.
Response:  We have 6 houses in one block and each house has 24 tanks of water. So, total number of tanks of water in one block = 6 x 24 = 144 tanks. Now, we need to find out how many tanks of water are there in each house. Since there are 6 houses in one block, so total number of tanks of water in all the houses = 144 / 6 = 24 tanks per house. Therefore, each house has 24 tanks of water.
Response:  We have to find out how many houses are there in each block and then sum them up.  So, let's start with the first block.  There are 14 houses in each block, right?  So, in the first block, there are 14 x 1 = 14 houses. Now, we move to the second block. In this block, there are also 14 houses. Therefore, the total number of houses in both blocks is 14 + 14 = 28 houses. Since there are 5 blocks in total, the total number of houses is 28 x 5 = 140 houses.
Response:  We have to distribute 20 tonnes of junk among 20 blocks with each block having 32 tons of junk. So, we need to calculate how many tons of junk can be distributed in one block. To do this, we divide the total amount of junk (20 tonnes) by the number of blocks (20). Therefore, each block will get: 20/20 = 1 ton of junk. Now, let's check if it is possible to distribute 32 tons of junk in each block. Yes, it is possible since 32 tons is less than 1 ton. So, each block will get 32/1 = 32 tons of junk.
Response:  We have to find out how many janks of melon are required to fill one block and then calculate how many blocks it will take to fill 30 tons of melons.  So, let's start with finding out how much space one block takes in terms of janks of melon. According to the question, one block is equal to 78 blocks, so we can assume that one block takes 78 janks of melon. Now, we need to find out how many janks of melon are required to fill one block. Since there are 30 tons of melons and each ton is equal to 16 kgs (as per the question), we can calculate the number of janks of melon required to fill one block as follows: Number of janks = Total weight of melons / Weight of one jank of melon = 30 tons x 16 kg/ton = 480 kg / 78 janks = approximately 6.25 janks of melon per block Therefore, if we want to fill 30 tons of melons, we will require approximately 30 x 6.25 = 187.5 janks of melon.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks it will take to cover 55 tons of coal in one block.  Since each block has 8 tons of space, we need to divide 55 tons by 8 to get the number of blocks required. So, we need 7 blocks (55/8 = 7). Now, let's assume that each block can hold 32 tons of coal. Therefore, if we want to fill one block with coal, we need 32 tons of coal. If there are 8 blocks in total, then we can calculate the total amount of coal needed as follows: Total coal needed = Number of blocks x Amount of coal per block = 8 x 32 = 256 tons.
Response:  We have 81 blocks in total and each block has 4 houses. So, we have 81 x 4 = 324 houses altogether. Now, each house has 12 tanks of water, so we have 324 x 12 = 3968 liters of water in total.
Response:  We have 16 blocks of size 4 tonnes each. So, total weight of one block = 4 tonnes. Now, we need to find out how many janks (a unit of measurement) are required to fill one block. As per the question, each jank is equal to 0.25 tonne. Therefore, number of janks required to fill one block = Total weight of one block / Jank weight = 16 tonnes / 0.25 tonnes = 64 janks. Since there are 17 blocks in total, number of janks required to fill all the blocks = Number of janks required to fill one block x Number of blocks = 64 janks x 17 blocks = 1088 janks.
Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 10 people Rebeka can make with her 20 balls. To do this, we need to divide 20 by 10. So, there are 2 groups of 10 people that Rebeka can make with her 20 balls. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 5-5 members can be formed from 10 people. To do this, we need to divide 10 by 5, which gives us 2. So, there are 2 groups of 5-5 members that can be formed from 10 people. Now, let's see how many groups of 4-4 members can be formed from the remaining 5 people after forming the two groups of 5-5 members. To do this, we need to divide 5 by 4, which gives us 1.25. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, there are 2 groups of 4-4 members that can be formed from the remaining 5 people after forming the two groups of 5-5 members.
"Response:  We have to divide 11 into 2 parts such that each part contains an equal number of andas (units).  There are 5 andas in one rebekam (a unit of measurement), so we need to find out how many rebekams we can make from 11.  To do this, we divide 11 by 5:

11 / 5 = 2.2

So, we can make 2 rebekams from 11. Each rebekam has 5 andas, so there will be 5 x 2 = 10 andas in total."
Response:  We have 7 people in total (Rebeka and 6 others). Each person has to carry either an apple or an orange. Since Rebeka is carrying an apple, each of the other 6 people will have to carry either an apple or an orange. So, there are 6 apples and 6 oranges in total. Therefore, the answer is 12 fruits.
Response:  We have three groups of people who want to collect sand from the beach. Each group has 5 members. How many sandbags will each member need if they are working together?  To find out, we can divide the total number of sandbags needed (3 x 5 = 15) among the three groups. So, each member in each group will need 5 sandbags.
Response:  We have to group 18 red beads and 72 black beads into 6 sets of equal size. To do this, we can use division. So, let's divide both groups by 6: 18 / 6 = 3 (red beads) and 72 / 6 = 12 (black beads). Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 red beads and 12 black beads we can make. There are 6 sets possible: {3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0}, {3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, or {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}. Therefore, there are 6 different ways to arrange the beads in sets of 3 red beads and 12 black beads.
Response:  We have to divide 99 into three parts such that the sum of the parts is equal to 27.  The smallest possible part is 1, so we can take one part as 1.  Now, let's find out how many parts we can take for the remaining amount of 98.  We can take 3 parts of 32 each (since 3 x 32 = 96), and then 1 part of 5 left over ( since 5 - 3 x 32 = 5). Therefore, the solution is:  One part of 1 + Three parts of 32 + One part of 5 = 99 / 4 = 27.
"Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required to make 50 kg of anda (bread).  Since we know that 1 kg of anda requires 200 g of rice flour, we can calculate the number of kilograms of rice needed as follows:

Ratio of rice to anda = 200 g/kg of anda
Number of kgs of anda = 50 kg
Total amount of rice required = Number of kgs of anda x Ratio of rice to anda
= 50 kg x 200 g/kg of anda
= 10,000 g

Therefore, we need 10 kg of rice to make 50 kg of bread."
Response:  We have to find out how many groups of 20 can be formed with 50 members and how many groups of 12 can be formed with 50 members.  To do this, we need to divide both numbers by 20 and 12 respectively.  So, 50 / 20 = 2.5 groups of 20 can be formed and 50 / 12 = 4 groups of 12 can be formed. Now, let's see what happens when we multiply these two numbers together. 2.5 x 4 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 groups of 20 that can be formed with 50 members and 4 groups of 12 that can be formed with 50 members.
Response:  If Lyuk can get 154 points in total, and each round has 11 points, then we need to find out how many rounds Lyuk will play. So, we divide 154 by 11 = 13.63 (round number). Since you cannot have a fraction of a round, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 14 rounds. Therefore, Lyuk will play 14 rounds.
Response:  We have 177 rounds to play and each round has 46 points. So, in total we have 177 x 46 = 8208 points to distribute among the rounds. Now, if O plays 5 rounds, then he will get 5 x 46 = 230 points from those rounds. Therefore, the remaining points (8208 - 230) are distributed among the other players.
Response:  We have to find out how many rounds are there in total and then calculate the average score for each round.  There are 84 points in total.  If we divide it by 2 rounds, we get an average score of 42 points per round.
Response:  If there are 146 rounds in each round, and if one round takes 3 minutes to complete, then the total time taken for all 146 rounds will be: Time = Number of rounds x Time per round = 146 x 3 = 438 minutes. Now, if we want to know how many rounds can be completed in 157 minutes, we need to divide the total time by the time required for one round: Rounds = Total time / Time per round = 438 / 3 = 146 rounds. So, in 157 minutes, 146 rounds can be completed.
Response:  If Lyuk can get 3 points for each round he plays, and he has played 78 rounds so far, then he has gotten a total of 234 points (3 x 78 = 234). So, if Oy asks how many rounds Lyuk will play in total, we can say that Lyuk will play a total of 78 + X rounds, where X is the number of rounds that Oy wants to play. Therefore, the answer is 78 + X.
Response:  We have to find out how many motes are required for each har and then sum them up.  There are 2 types of har - small and big. The ratio of small to big har is given as 1:3. So, if there are x small har, there will be 3x big har. Now, we need to calculate the total number of motes required for all the har. For small har, it takes 2 motes to make one har, so the total number of motes required for x small har is 2x. Similarly, for big har, it takes 32 motes to make one har, so the total number of motes required for 3x big har is 32x. Therefore, the total number of motes required for all the har is 2x + 32x = 54x.
Response:  We know that Amilie has 11 friends and each friend of hers loses Rs. 280 due to her mistake. So, in total, Amilie's friends lose Rs. 280 x 11 = Rs. 3080. Now, we are asked how many motis (a unit of weight equal to 4 grams) of gold can be bought with this amount. To find out, we need to divide the total amount by the price of gold per moti. Assuming the price of gold is Rs. 50 per moti, we get: Rs. 3080 / Rs. 50 = 61.6 motis of gold. Therefore, Amilie's friends can buy 61.6 motis of gold with the money they lost due to Amilie's mistake.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Emily can make her friend Moti lose in 16 games of hide and seek. Since each game lasts for 3 minutes, we need to divide the total time by the number of games played. So, if Emily plays with Moti for 1 hour (which is equal to 60 minutes), she will play 16 x 3 = 48 games of hide and seek with Moti. Now, since Moti loses every game, Emily wins 48 games. Therefore, the answer is 48.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times Emily can make her friend Moti lose weight.  If she can make him lose 18 kg of weight in 6 months, then she will be able to make him lose 30 kg of weight in total (since there are 24 months left). So, the number of times Emily needs to make Moti lose weight is:

$$ \frac{30}{18} = 1.77 \times $$

Therefore, Emily needs to make Moti lose weight approximately 1.77 times."
Response:  We have to find out how many motes are there in each har and then sum them up.  There are 5 harms in total, so let's count the number of motes in each harm:  Har 1 has 4 motes, Har 2 has 3 motes, Har 3 has 2 motes, Har 4 has 5 motes, and Har 5 has 7 motes. Therefore, the total number of motes is: 4 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 23 motes. So, Amilie has 23 motes.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times Emily can make her friend lose $72 in total.  If each time she takes away $3 from her friend, then after 6 times, her friend will be left with nothing ($0). So, the number of times Emily can make her friend lose $72 is:

$72 / $3 = 24 times

Therefore, Emily can make her friend lose $72 24 times."
Response:  We have to find out how many motes are required for each haram and then sum them up.  For the first haram, we need 43 tonnes of motes (43 x 10 = 430).  For the second haram, we need 20 tonnes of motes (20 x 10 = 200).  So, in total, we need 630 tonnes of motes (430 + 200 = 630).
Response:  We have to find out how many motis Emily has lost in total and then calculate the average loss per haram.  So, let's break down the given information:  Emily has lost 44 tamarind balls (harams) in total. Out of these, she has lost 26 tamarinds to Moti. Now, we need to find out how many motis Emily has lost per haram. To do this, we divide the number of tamarinds Emily lost to Moti (26) by the total number of tamarinds Emily lost (44):  Number of motis Emily lost per haram = 26/44 = 0.57 (or approximately 1/2) Therefore, Emily has lost around half a moti for every haram she has lost.
Response:  We have two children - 819058 and 668278. They are both going to school during summer vacation. The distance between their homes is 4 km. Now, let's calculate how long it will take for them to reach each other's houses walking at a speed of 3 km/h.  For child 819058, it will take 1 hour to walk 4 km = 4 hours to reach home from school. Similarly, for child 668278, it will take 1 hour to walk 4 km = 4 hours to reach home from school. Therefore, they will meet after 4 hours. So, the answer is 4 hours.
Response:  We know that there are 20 children in total - 5 from Group A, 7 from Group B, and 8 from Group C.  During the summer camp, 3 children from each group went to the countryside for 3 days. So, the number of children who stayed at home is:  Number of children from Group A = 5 x 3 = 15  Number of children from Group B = 7 x 3 = 21  Number of children from Group C = 8 x 3 = 24 Total number of children staying at home = 15 + 21 + 24 = 60 Therefore, out of the 20 children, 40 remained at home during the summer camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in the village and 629424 of them have gone to school. So, the number of children who haven't gone to school is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627. Therefore, out of the total 898051 children in the village, 268627 children haven't gone to school yet.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many children are there in total. From the question, we can see that there are 313473 children. Now, let's calculate the number of children who went to school. According to the question, 274865 children went to school. So, the difference between the total number of children and those who went to school is 38608 (313473 - 274865). Therefore, 38608 children did not go to school during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that Garmiik (Garima) has 3 children - Aryan, Anushka and Avni.  So, the total number of children in her house is 3.  Now, we are told that there are 907611 students in Larenees School.  Since Garmiik lives near Larenees School, it means that some of these students live nearby too.  Therefore, the number of students living near Garmiik's house is not zero.  However, since we don't have any information about how many students actually live near Garmiik's house, let's assume that the number of students living near her house is also 3.  So, the final answer is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 828521 children in the school and we want to find out how many of them live at home. So, let's divide the total number of children by the number of children who live at home: 828521 ÷ 40 = 207130. Therefore, approximately 207130 children live at home.
Response:  We know that there are 616 students in Larence School and 917 students in Larkin School.  So, the total number of students in both schools is 616 + 917 = 1533.  Now, we need to find out how many students from Larence School went to the camp.  Since 80% of the students from Larence School went to the camp, we can calculate it as follows:  Number of students from Larence School who went to the camp = (616 x 0.8) = 492.
"Response:  We know that there are 3404 students in the school and they have to attend the summer camp for 13 days. So, the total number of students attending the summer camp is:

3404 x 13 = 42,652

Now, we need to subtract the number of students who will be attending the summer camp from the total number of students in the school:

42,652 - 34,044 = 8,608

So, approximately 8,608 students will not be attending the summer camp."
"Response:  We know that there are 6107 students in the school and they have to attend the summer camp for 5907 hours. So, the total number of hours spent by all the students at the summer camp is:

Total hours = Number of students x Total hours attended
= 6107 x 5907
= 3485910 hours
Now, we need to find out how many students went outside the village during the summer camp. The passage says that 22 students went outside the village. Therefore, the number of students who did not go outside the village is:

Number of students who did not go outside = Total number of students - Number of students who went outside
= 6107 - 22
= 6085 students
So, out of the total 6107 students, 6085 students stayed inside the village during the summer camp, while 22 students went outside the village."
Response:  We have 649 students in total (including both inside and outside the house). Out of them, 321 are boys and 328 are girls. So, the number of boys is 321.
Response:  Aditya has three trays of basil seeds and wants to know how many seeds Jackie has. If Aditya has 3 trays with 20 seeds in each tray, then he has a total of 60 seeds (3 x 20 = 60). Now, we need to find out how many seeds Jackie has. According to the question, Jackie has 9 seeds. So, the difference between the number of seeds Aditya has and Jackie has is 60 - 9 = 51 seeds. Therefore, Jackie has 51 seeds of basil.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in one apple and then multiply it with the number of apples Jack has given Dakota. So, let's start by finding out how many seeds are in one apple. According to the question, an apple contains 5 seeds. Now, we need to find out how many apples Jack gave Dakota. From the question, we know that Jack gave Dakota 10 apples. Therefore, the total number of seeds in all the apples that Jack gave Dakota is: Number of seeds in one apple x Total number of apples = 5 seeds/apple x 10 apples = 50 seeds Now, we need to find out how many seeds Dakota gave Jack. From the question, we know that Dakota gave Jack 20 seeds. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of seeds in all the apples (given by Jack) = 50 seeds + Number of seeds in all the apples (given by Dakota) = 50 seeds + 20 seeds = 70 seeds
Response:  Adam has 9 seeds and Jackie has 10 tonnes of seeds. To find out how many seeds Jackie has, we need to convert 10 tonnes into number of seeds. 1 tone = 1000 kg So, Jackie has 10 x 1000 = 10,000 kg of seeds. Now, let's convert kg to number of seeds. 1 kg = 1000 seeds (approximately) Therefore, Jackie has 10,000 / 1000 = 10 seeds.
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and wants to share them equally among 4 people. So, he will give 2.5 apples to each person (10 / 4 = 2.5). Now, there are 8 apples left with Edam, who has already eaten 2.5 apples. Therefore, Edam has 5.5 apples left (8 - 2.5 = 5.5).
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in total and then calculate the number of seeds that Jackie has.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 6 seeds in one apple.  Jackie has 4 apples.  Therefore, the total number of seeds that Jackie has is: 6 x 4 = 24 seeds.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in 9 tonnes of basil and then subtract that from 1800 kg. So, let's start with finding out how many seeds are in 9 tonnes of basil.  One tonne is equal to 1000 kg, so 9 tonnes is equal to 9 x 1000 = 9000 kg. Now, we know that 1 kg of basil contains 250 seeds, so 9000 kg of basil contains 9000 x 250 = 225,000 seeds. Now, we need to subtract this number from 1800 kg. Therefore, the answer is 1675 kg (1800 - 225,000).
"Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are there in total and then calculate the percentage of Jackie's share.  So, let's start with the total number of seeds first.  There are 12 trays of seeds, each containing 3 seeds. Therefore, the total number of seeds is:

12 x 3 = 36 seeds
Now, we need to find out how many seeds Jackie gets. According to the question, Jackie gets 9 trays of seeds, which means he gets:

9 x 3 = 27 seeds
So, Jackie gets 27/36 = 75% of the total seeds."
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are there in each of the following quantities: 10 tonnes, 50 tonnes, and 100 tonnes.  So, we will start with the first quantity - 10 tonnes. There are 100 kg in 1 tonne, so there are 1000 kg (10 tonnes x 100 kg/tonne) of seeds in total. Now, let's move to the next quantity - 50 tonnes. There are again 100 kg in 1 tonne, so there are 5000 kg (50 tonnes x 100 kg/tonne) of seeds in total. Finally, for the last quantity - 100 tonnes, there are 10,000 kg (100 tonnes x 100 kg/tonne) of sebs in total. Therefore, the total number of seeds is: 1000 kg + 5000 kg + 10,000 kg = 25,000 kg.
Response:  Jack has 5 tangerines and 8 oranges in his basket. He wants to know how many apples he has. So, we need to subtract the number of fruits that are not apples from the total number of fruits. Therefore, the number of apples Jack has is: 5 (tangerines) - 8 (oranges) = 3 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of cups Helen has given away so far. According to the question, she has given away 31 cups out of which 270 are still left with her. So, the total number of cups she has given away is 270 - 31 = 239 cups. Now, let's find out how many cups Helen will have after 419 days. As per the question, if she gives away one cup every day, then she will have 419 - 365 (days taken to give away 31 cups) = 54 cups left with her after 419 days. Therefore, the answer is 54 cups.
Response:  Helena made 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 rice krispie treats today. That means she has baked a total of 141 treats so far (90 + 51). Now, let's calculate how many chocolate chip cookies Helena has left. If she had 484 chocolate chip cookies in total, then she must have given away or used up 343 cookies (484 - 141 = 343). So, Helena has 141 chocolate chip cookies left.
Response:  We know that Helena has 527 chocolates and 86 kishmishes. If she gives away 10 chocolates and 3 kishmishes to her friend, then she will have 517 chocolates and 83 kishmishes left. Now, if she wants to give away 86 more chocolates and 554 more kishmishes to her friend, then she will have 0 chocolates and 309 kishmishes left. So, the final amount of chocolates and kishmishes that Helena has after giving them all away is 0 chocolates and 309 kishmishes.
Response:  We have to find out how many chocolates and cookies Helen has in total.  From the question, we know that Helen has 144 chocolate chip muffins and 397 rice krispie treats. To calculate the total number of chocolates and cookies, we need to add these two numbers together. So, the total number of chocolates and cookies is: 144 + 397 = 541. Therefore, Helen has 541 chocolates and cookies in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of chocolate chips in Helen's bag. According to the question, there are 19 tablespoons of chocolate chips in each bar of chocolate. Since there are 231 bars of chocolate in Helen's bag, the total number of chocolate chips in her bag is:

19 x 231 = 4599 chocolate chips

Now, let's move on to calculating the number of rice crackers in Helen's bag. The question states that there are 237 rice crackers in each pack. Since there are 5 packs of rice crackers in Helen's bag, the total number of rice crackers in her bag is:

237 x 5 = 1185 rice crackers

So, the final answer is:

4599 (chocolate chips) + 1185 (rice crackers) = 5784 snacks in Helen's bag."
Response:  Helena has 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 kishmish cookies. If she wants to make 75 truffles with each cookie having 2-3 pieces of filling, how many pieces of filling will she need in total?  To calculate this, we can use the following formula: Total number of pieces of filling = Number of cookies x Number of pieces per cookie x Factor (in this case, 2 or 3) So, total number of pieces of filling needed = 197 cookies x 2 pieces/cookie x 75 truffles = 10,825 pieces of filling.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of chocolates that Helen has given away. According to the question, she gave away 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 rice krispies treats. Therefore, the total number of chocolates = 519 + 300 = 819 chocolates. Now, let's find out how many rice krispies treats Omi has made. According to the question, Omi made 280 rice krispies treats. So, the total number of rice krispies treats = 280 treats. Finally, we can conclude that Helen has given away 819 chocolates and Omi has made 280 rice krispies treats.

Response:  We have to find out how many new friends Okkad can make if he plays cricket with his old friend for 48 hours and then invites all of them to play together.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of hours Okkad has played cricket with his old friend. As per the question, they have been playing for 78 hours. Now, let's assume that in these 78 hours, Okkad made 30 new friends (as per the question). So, the total number of people Okkad has met through cricket is: 78 hours x 30 new friends = 2340 hours. Next, we need to calculate the time taken by Okkad to invite all of them to play together. As per the question, it took him 86 hours to invite all of them. Therefore, the total time taken by Okkad to meet new friends through cricket is: 2340 hours - 86 hours = 2254 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many new games and old games Katrik will play in total.  New games = 8 x 10 = 80 Old games = 69 So, total number of games Katrik will play is 80 + 69 = 149.
Response:  We know that Ketaki has played 62 games and won 80 points. Her friend Mitra has played 73 games and won 41 points. To find out how many more points Ketaki has scored than Mitra, we need to subtract the number of points Mitra has won from the total number of points Ketaki has won. So, the difference between their scores is: 62 - 41 = 21 points. Therefore, Ketaki has scored 21 more points than Mitra.
Response:  We have 57 friends and we want to play cricket with them. So, each friend will get 1/57 chance of playing. Now, there are 63 players in total including us (the narrator). So, each player including us will get 1/63 chances of playing. Therefore, the probability of any particular player getting to play is 1/63.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Keti can play with her friends in total and also how much time she will take to complete that task.  So let's calculate it as follows:  Total number of days = 57 days - 39 days (old games) = 18 days  Now, we need to divide the total number of days by the number of days Keti spends playing with each friend.  Since Keti plays with all her friends for 34 days, we can calculate it as follows:  Number of days Keti spends playing with each friend = Total number of days / Number of days spent playing with all friends = 18 days / 34 days = 0.52 or 1/2 days per friend. Therefore, Keti can play with her friends for approximately half a day per friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred made $60 last week and Jessie spent $19 of it. So, Fred has $41 left with him. Now, let's calculate how much money Jessie earned in one day. Since he worked for 33 days, his daily earning can be calculated as follows: Daily Earning = Total Earnings / Number of Days Worked = $41 / 33 = $1.27 per day.
Response:  Fred earned $86 last week and spent $5 this week. He has $9 left after buying groceries. Jessie did not spend anything. So, Fred has $81 left with him. Now, let's calculate the amount of money that both Fred and Jessie have together: Fred - $81 + Jessie (nothing) = $81 + $0 = $81. Therefore, the total amount of money that both Fred and Jessie have is $81.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much money Fred made in the previous week. According to the question, Fred made $40 more than Jessie in the previous week. So, if Jessie made $16 dollars, then Fred must have made $56 dollars ($40 + $16). Therefore, Fred made $56 dollars in the previous week.
Response:  We have to find out how much profit Jessan made in one week and then calculate the percentage of profit.  So, we can write an equation as follows: Profit = Total revenue - Cost Total Revenue = $114 x 7 = $790 Cost = $22 x 5 = $110 Therefore, the profit is $680 ($790 - $110). Now, let's convert it into percentage. To do this, we need to divide the profit by total revenue and multiply by 100. Percentage of profit = (Profit / Total Revenue) x 100 = ($680 / $790) x 100 = 85.3% So, Jessan made approximately 85.3% profit in that week.
Response:  Fred earned $111 last week and spent $40 on Jason. So, Fred has $71 left. On the other hand, Jason received $85 from his grandfather and spent $44 on something. Therefore, Jason has $41 left. Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has after buying their toys: Fred bought a car for $115 and spent $44 on it, so he has $71 left. Jason bought a bicycle for $44 and spent $44 on it, so he has $0 left. Therefore, Fred has more money than Jason after buying their toys.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Fred made in the previous week. As per the question, Fred earned $49 dollars last week. Now, let's move on to Jason's earnings. According to the question, Jason earned $3 dollars less than what Fred earned. So, Jason earned $46 dollars last week ($49 - $3 = $46). Next, we need to find out how many days have passed since Fred started his job. As per the question, it has been 7 months (or 25 weeks) since Fred started working at the company. Finally, we can calculate Jason's salary increase as follows: Salary Increase = Total Earnings of Last Week x Percentage Increase = $46 x 10% = $4.60 Therefore, Jason received an increase of $4.60 in his salary for the past week.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much money Fred made in the previous week. According to the question, Fred earned $78 last week and Jessie spent $31 of that amount. So, Fred had $47 left after Jessie's expenditure. Now, let's calculate how much money Fred gained or lost due to Jessie's purchase. If Jessie bought something worth $14, then Fred lost $14. Therefore, Fred's balance is now $47 - $14 = $33. Finally, if Fred received $90 more this week, then his current balance would be $33 + $90 = $123.
Response:  Last week Fred earned $33 dollars and this week he earned $95 dollars. So, his total earnings for last seven days are = $33 + $95 = $128 dollars. Now, let's calculate how much money he made in each day of the week. To do that we divide his total earnings by the number of days he worked. So, if he worked for 7 days, then his daily earnings will be = $128 / 7 = $18 dollars per day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Fred made in total during the last week. We know that he earned $47 per day and worked for 5 days, so his total earnings for the week are: $47 x 5 = $235. Now, let's move on to Jason's part of the calculation. We know that he earned $99 per day and worked for 4 days, so his total earnings for the week are: $99 x 4 = $396. Finally, we add both their earnings together to find out who made more money overall: $235 + $396 = $631. Therefore, Fred made slightly more money than Jason overall.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate Jessica's weight in kilograms. As she is 71 years old and has a BMI of 28, her weight can be calculated as follows:

Weight (in kg) = Height (in meters) x Weight (in pounds) / 0.453592

Height = 160 cm / 100 = 1.6 m
Weight (in pounds) = 71 years x 0.453592 = 31.5 kg

Therefore, Jessica's weight in kilograms is approximately 31.5 kg. Now, let's calculate her body fat percentage based on her weight and height. According to the formula provided in the question:

Body Fat Percentage = (Weight in kg - Weight in water in kg) / (Weight in kg + Weight in water in kg)

Weight in water = 0.453592 x Weight in kg = 0.453592 x 31.5 kg = 14.2 kg

Therefore, Jessica's body fat percentage is approximately 20%."
Response:  Jessica weighs 27 kilograms and wants to lose weight. She has been jogging for an hour every day and has lost 10 kilos so far. To calculate how much more she needs to run to reach her target of losing 5 kg, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. Since Jessica runs at a speed of 6 km/h (which is a reasonable running speed), let's assume that she runs for 30 minutes per session. Therefore, the distance she covers in one session is: Distance = 6 km/h x 30 min = 1800 meters. Now, since she has already lost 10 kilos, her current weight is: Weight = 27 kg - 10 kg = 17 kg. To find out how many sessions she needs to run to reach her target of losing 5 kg, we can divide her remaining weight by the distance she covers in each session: Number of Sessions = Remaining Weight / Distance Covered = 17 kg / 1800 meters = 9.47 sessions. So, Jessica needs to run for approximately 9.5 sessions to reach her target weight of 15 kg.
Response:  Jessica weighed 126 kg before losing weight and now she weighs 66 kg. To calculate how much weight she lost, we can use the formula: Weight loss = New weight - Old weight So, in this case, the weight loss would be: Weight loss = 66 kg - 126 kg = -60 kg This means that Jessica lost 60 kg of weight.
Response:  Jessica weighs 35 kg and wants to lose weight. She starts jogging every day for 45 minutes from tomorrow. If she burns 69 calories per minute while jogging, how much weight will she lose in one week?  To calculate this, we need to know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if Jessica jogs for 45 minutes daily, she will burn a total of 45 x 7 = 315 calories per day through jogging. Now, to lose weight, she needs to consume fewer calories than what her body burns during exercise. Let's assume that she reduces her daily calorie intake by 500 calories. Therefore, her net caloric deficit per day would be 315 - 500 = -185 calories per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, her overall net caloric deficit for the week would be -185 x 7 = -1265 calories. As Jessica loses weight, her body will start burning more fat as fuel instead of carbohydrates. This means that she will also experience an increase in metabolism, which can help her lose even more weight. However, it is important to note that losing too much weight too quickly is not healthy and may lead to muscle loss or other negative consequences. It is always best to consult with a doctor or nutritionist before starting any new diet or exercise plan.
"Response:  Jessica weighs 114 kg and wants to lose weight. She has been jogging for 30 minutes every day for 7 days a week and has lost 50 kg in one month. To maintain her weight loss, she needs to eat fewer calories than she burns. If she eats 60 kcal less per day, how much will she weigh after 2 months?

Solution:
Let's calculate Jessica's daily calorie intake and expenditure based on the given information:
Daily Calorie Intake = BMR x Activity Level (in Kcal/day)
= 114 kg x 1.9 x 7 (days/week) x 30 min/day x 48 hours/week (assuming 8 hours of sleep/night)
= 2,500 kcal/day

Now, let's calculate the weight loss per month:
Weight Loss Per Month = Daily Calorie Deficit x Number of Days in Month
= 500 kcal/day x 30 days
= 15,000 kcal

So, Jessica loses approximately 15 kg or 33 lbs in one month.

To find out how much she will weigh after two months, we can multiply the weight loss per month by 2:
New Weight After Two Months = Weight Loss Per Month x Number of Months
= 15,000 kcal x 2 months
= 30,000 kcal

Therefore, after two months, Jessica will weigh approximately 84 kg or 185 lbs."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesica has lost 9 kilograms in 9 weeks. So, her weight loss per week is 9/9 = 1 kilogram per week. Now, she gained 62 kilograms in one month and lost 140 kilograms in another month. Therefore, her total weight gain or loss can be calculated as follows: Total weight gain or loss = Gain in one month + Loss in another month = 62 kg + (-140 kg) = -78 kg. So, Jesica has lost a total of 78 kilograms.
Response:  First week (Week 1), Jessica consumed 92 kilos of food and lost 56 kilos of weight. In the second week (Week 2), she consumed 99 kilos of food and lost 43 kilos of weight. Now, let's calculate how much weight Jessica will lose in total after two weeks: Total weight loss = Weight gained in Week 1 + Weight lost in Week 2 - Weight gained in Week 2 Total weight loss = 92 kg + 56 kg - 43 kg = 77 kg So, Jessica will lose 77 kilograms of weight in total after two weeks.
Response:  We have to find out how many pins are required for 95 tonnes of sugar and then divide it by 64 to get the number of bags per ton. So, firstly we need to convert 95 tonnes into kilograms. 1 tone = 1000 kg, so 95 tonnes = 95 x 1000 = 95,000 kg. Now, we know that each bag of sugar can hold 64 kg, so we need to divide the total weight of sugar by the capacity of each bag to get the number of bags.  Number of bags = Total weight of sugar / Capacity of each bag = 95,000 kg / 64 kg/bag = 1521 bags. Therefore, if you want to pack 61 tons of sugar in 64-kg bags, you will require 61 x 64 = 3872 bags.
Response:  We are given that there are 93 pins in one side of the box and 97 pins in the other side. Since we have to find out how many pins are in total, we need to add both these numbers. So, the total number of pins is : 93 + 97 = 190 pins. Therefore, there are 190 pins in the box.
"Response:  We have to find out how many grams of rice are required to make 30 chapatis and how much wheat flour is required for making 75 rotis.  So, we need to convert both these quantities from ""chapati"" or ""rotis"" to grams.  For 30 chapatis, we need 30 x 100 = 3000 grams of rice.  And for 75 rotis, we need 75 x 100 = 7500 grams of wheat flour.  Now, let's calculate the total weight in grams of all the ingredients needed for making these chapatis and rotis.  For this, we need to add the weights of rice and wheat flour.  So, the total weight in grams of all the ingredients needed is 3000 + 7500 = 10500 grams.  Therefore, the answer is 10500 grams."
Response:  We know that there are 79 dogs in the shelter and 24 cats. So, the total number of pets is 79 + 24 = 103. Now, we need to find out how many pets are left after 51 pets have been adopted. Therefore, the remaining number of pets is 103 - 51 = 52.
"Response:  We have 171 tomatoes in one bigha of land and we sell them at Rs 30 per kg. So, total revenue from selling tomatoes is:

Revenue = Number of Tomatoes x Selling Price per Kg
= 171 x 30
= 5130

Now, after deducting the cost price of tomatoes, we get the profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost Price
= 5130 -?

We don't know the exact cost price of tomatoes, but let's assume it to be Rs 20 per kg. Then, the profit would be:

Profit = 5130 - 20 x 171
= 5130 - 3420
= 1710

So, after selling all 171 tomatoes, the farmer will have a profit of Rs 1710."
"Response:  We have 160 bags of potatoes and we want to sell them for Rs.56 each. So, the total revenue will be:

Revenue = Number of bags x Selling price per bag
= 160 x 56
= Rs.8,720

Now, after deducting the cost price of Rs.41 per kg, we get the profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost price
= 8,720 - (160 x 41)
= Rs.4,396

So, there will be Rs.4,396 left after selling all the 160 bags of potatoes."
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of 10 kg each can be filled with tomatoes from 90 tonnes.  So, we need to divide 90 tonnes by 10 kg per bag.  Therefore, the number of bags that can be filled is:

90 tonnes / 10 kg per bag = 900 bags

So, there are 900 bags of 10 kg each that can be filled with tomatoes from 90 tonnes."
Response:  We have 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in total. If we give 12 tomatoes to each of the 10 people, how many tomatoes will be left for us?  Therefore, there will be 175 - (12 x 10) = 143 tomatoes left for us. Similarly, if we give 8 potatoes to each of the 10 people, how many potatoes will be left for us? Therefore, there will be 77 - (8 x 10) = 69 potatoes left for us.
Response:  We have 177 tomatoes and 12 aloo (potatoes) in one bag. If we take out 53 tomatoes from that bag, how many tomatoes will be left in the original bag? So, there will be 124 tomatoes left in the original bag.
"Response:  We have:

* 105 hectares of land (bigha)
* 71 lakh tomatoes (red and ripe)
* Total area under cultivation = 105 bighas x 71 lakh tomatoes = 7455 lakh square feet (approximately)

Now, we need to calculate how many tonnes of tomatoes can be grown in this area.

To do this, we will use the conversion factor between square feet and tonnes. One square foot is equal to 0.11 square meters (approximately). So,

Total area under cultivation = 7455 lakh square feet / 0.11 square meter = 6782500 tonnes (approximately)

Therefore, if 137 tonnes of tomatoes are added to the existing crop, it would cover an area of approximately:

6782500 tonnes / 137 tonnes = 502976 square meters (approximately)"
Response:  We have to make sure that each of the 10 balls (5 red and 5 blue) are placed in separate boxes so that they don't get mixed up.  Since there are 10 balls in total, we need at least 10 boxes to keep them organized.  So, the minimum number of boxes required is 10.
"Response:  We have to find out how many tanks are required for each house and then multiply it with the total number of houses to get the total number of tanks needed.  So, let's first calculate the number of tanks required for each house:

Each house requires 17 tankers of water (as per the question). Now, we need to divide this value by 8 (since there are 8 hours in a day) to get the number of tanks required per hour:

17 / 8 = 2.13 tankers per hour

Now, we need to convert this value into minutes:

2.13 tankers per hour x 60 minutes per hour = 129.8 minutes per hour

So, each house requires approximately 129.8 minutes worth of water per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can multiply this value by 24 to get the total number of minutes required for all the houses in a day:

129.8 minutes per hour x 24 hours per day = 3075.2 minutes per day

Finally, we need to convert this value from minutes to seconds:

3075.2 minutes per day x 60 seconds per minute = 184,570 seconds per day

Therefore, the answer is 184,570 seconds."
Response:  We have to find out how many tiles are required for each wall and then add them up.  For that, we need to know the length of each wall.  Let's assume the length of each wall is x meters.  Now, we need to calculate the number of tiles required for each wall based on the formula given in the question: Number of tiles = Length of wall / 11 meters per tile. So, the number of tiles required for each wall is x/11 meters. Since there are 4 walls, the total number of tiles required is 4x/11 meters. To find out how much area each tile covers, we can use the formula: Area of one tile = Length of wall / Number of tiles. So, the area of each tile is x/4x = 1/4 meter^2. Therefore, the total area of all four walls is 4x/11 meters \* (1/4) meter^2 = 10/4 = 2.5 meters^2.
Response:  We have to find out how many small boxes (less than 5 kg) can be packed in one big box (15 kg). To do this, we need to divide the total weight of the small boxes (30 kg) by the weight of each small box (0.5 kg). So, we get: Number of small boxes = Total weight of small boxes / Weight of each small box = 30 kg / 0.5 kg = 60 small boxes Now, we know that 60 small boxes can fit inside one big box (15 kg), so John can pack 60 small boxes in one big box.
"Response:  We have to find out how many bags of wheat flour John can make from one quintal of wheat.  One quintal is equal to 100 kg or 200 lbs. So, we need to divide the weight of wheat by the weight of one bag of wheat flour.  The weight of one bag of wheat flour is approximately 25 kg (or 55 lbs). Therefore, we can calculate as follows:

Number of bags = Total weight / Weight of one bag
= 100 kg / 25 kg
= 4

So, John can make 4 bags of wheat flour from one quintal of wheat."
Response:  We have to find out how many times John can make a hole in one day if he takes 74 minutes to make one hole. To do this, we need to divide the total time taken by John to make one hole (74 minutes) by the time taken for him to make one hole (74 minutes). So, the number of holes John can make in one day is: Number of holes = Total time taken / Time taken for one hole = 74 minutes / 74 minutes = 1 Therefore, John can make only one hole in one day.
Response:  We have to find out how many tonnes of soil are required for each big and small pit.  For each big pit, we need 14 tons of soil, so the total requirement is 14 x 4 = 56 tons.  Similarly, for each small pit, we need 25 tons of soil, so the total requirement is 25 x 8 = 200 tons.  Therefore, John needs 56 + 200 = 256 tons of soil in total.
Response:  We have to divide the total weight of the packets (42 tonnes) by the number of packets (3). So, we get: 42 tonnes / 3 packets = 14 tonnes per packet. Therefore, Robin can carry one packet containing approximately 14 tonnes of goods.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of chammach can be made from 43 robin bags containing 23 tukdars each.  So, we need to divide 43 by 23 to get the number of packets that can be made.  When we divide 43 by 23, we get 1.9. Therefore, there can be approximately 1 packet of chammach made from every 1.9 robin bags.
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of Robin can fit in one box and then calculate how much space is left after filling all the boxes with Robin.  The size of each packet is given as 7 tukda (pieces) per packet.  So, we need to divide the total number of pieces of Robin by the number of packets that can fit in one box.  From the question, we know that there are 41 pieces of Robin in total.  Therefore, we can calculate the number of packets that can fit in one box as follows:
Number of packets = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per packet
= 41 / 7
= 6
So, six packets of Robin can fit in one box. Now, let's calculate the amount of space left after filling all the boxes with Robin:
Space left = Total number of pieces - Number of packets filled x Number of pieces per packet
= 41 - 6 x 7
= 28
Therefore, there will be 28 tukda (pieces) of space left in the box after filling all the six packets of Robin."
Response:  We have 28 packets of chammach (each packet contains 4 tukdars). So, total number of tukdars = 28 x 4 = 112 tukdars. Now we have to distribute these 112 tukdars among 13 packers in such a way that each packer gets an equal number of tukdars. Since there are 13 packers, each packer will get = 112 / 13 = 8 tukdars. Therefore, Robink has distributed 8 tukdars to each of the 13 packers.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of chammach can be filled in each packet of robin.  Each packet of robin contains 9 tukdars, so we need to divide the total number of tukdars by 9 to find out how many packets of chammach can be filled in each packet of robin.  Total number of tukdars = 21 x 45 = 945 tukdars.  Now, dividing 945 by 9 gives us 106 packets of chammach that can be filled in each packet of robin.
"Response:  We have 28 packets of chammach (each containing 6 tukdars) and 14 packets of mithai ( each containing 5 tukdars). So, in total we have:

28 packets x 6 tukdars/packet = 168 tukdars of chammach
14 packets x 5 tukdars/packet = 70 tukdars of mithai
Total number of tukdars = 168 + 70 = 238 tukdars
So, there are 238 tukdars in Robinka's bag."
Response:  We have to make 3 shorts in 60 minutes. So, we need to make 1/2 short per minute. Now, let's calculate how many minutes it takes to make 6 shorts. 6 / 0.5 = 12 minutes. Therefore, it will take 12 minutes to make 6 shorts.
Response:  The machine can make 5 shirts in 1 minute. So, it makes 5 x 60 = 300 shirts in 1 hour. Now, if we have to calculate how many shirts the machine can make in 5 minutes, we need to multiply the number of shirts made in 1 hour by 5/60. Therefore, the machine can make 300 x 5/60 = 75 shirts in 5 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts and today it made 44 shirts in one minute. So, if we divide the number of shirts made yesterday by the time taken to make them (in minutes), we get: Number of shirts made per minute = Total number of shirts made / Time taken to make them = 9 / 1 = 9  Therefore, the machine can make 9 shirts in one minute.
"Response:  The machine made 13 shirts yesterday and today it made 3 shirts in 6 minutes. So, the rate at which the machine makes shirts is:

Number of shirts made = Total number of shirts / Time taken to make one shirt
= 13 + 3 / 6
= 20

Therefore, the machine can make 20 shirts in one minute."
Response:  The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and today it took 1 minute to make 8 shirts. So, the time taken by the machine to make one shirt is: Time = Number of shirts / Speed (in minutes) = 9/1 = 9 minutes.
Response:  If one machine can make three shirts in one minute and four shirts are made today, then the total number of shirts produced today is: 3 + 4 = 7 shirts.  Now, if eight shirts are made tomorrow, the total number of shirts produced today and tomorrow is: 7 + 8 = 15 shirts.
Response:  We know that in one minute, the machine can produce 6 shirts. So, in 12 minutes, it can make 6 x 12 = 72 shirts. Now, we need to find out how many shirts the machine can make in total. Since today is Monday and there are 5 days left in the week (Monday to Friday), the machine will make a total of 72 x 5 = 360 shirts. Therefore, the answer is 360 shirts.
Response:  The machine can produce shirts in 6 minutes each. So, in one minute, it can make 6/60 = 0.1 shirts. In an hour, it can make 0.1 x 60 = 6 shirts. Therefore, today, the machine made 12 - 6 = 6 more shirts than yesterday.
"Response:  We are given that Rohan earns $165 per day and he works for 5 days in a week. So his total daily income is:

$165/day x 5 days/week = $825/week

-$66 = $2334

So, Ramesh had $2334 left after spending."
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Ringo made in total during his 154 days of work and then divide it by the number of working days to get the average amount earned per day.

So, according to the question, Ringo worked for 154 days and earned $325 per day. Therefore, his total earnings are:

$325 x 154 = $ Fifty-seven thousand four hundred fifty dollars ($57,450)

Now, let's divide this amount by the number of working days to find out the average amount earned per day:

$57,450 / 154 days = $ $386 per day

Therefore, Ringo averaged $386 per day during his 154 days of work at the carnival."
Response:  We have to buy 10 kg of sugar and we are given two options - option A and option B. Option A is to buy it from Lusi Kirana Store at Rs. 45 per kg, and option B is to buy it from Kekkake Packaging at Rs. 38 per kg. So, if we choose option A, we will have to pay Rs. 45 x 10 = Rs. 450 for 10 kg of sugar. If we choose option B, we will have to pay Rs. 38 x 10 = Rs. 380 for 10 kg of sugar. Therefore, the cheaper option is to buy sugar from Kekkake Packaging at Rs. 38 per kg.
Response:  We have 4 packets of chocolates (22 pieces) and we want to distribute them equally among 4 friends. So each friend will get 5 packets of chocolates (5 x 22 = 110 pieces). Now let's assume that there are 16 packs of cookies (16 x 10 = 160 pieces). If we divide these cookies equally among the same 4 friends, then each friend will get 4 packs of cookies (4 x 16 = 64 pieces). Therefore, the total number of chocolate packets that Kirana will give to Kunal is 110.
Response:  We have to find out how many packets of kerosene are there in total and then calculate the cost of each packet.  So, we can start with the given information:  There are 23 packets of kerosene in total. Each packet contains 5 liters of kerosene. Now, let's calculate the total volume of kerosene in all the packets: Total volume = Number of packets x Volume per packet = 23 packets x 5 liters/packet = 115 liters Now, we know that the price of one liter of kerosene is Rs. 60. So, we can calculate the total cost of all the kerosene packets as follows: Total cost = Total volume x Price per liter = 115 liters x Rs. 60/liter = Rs. 6900 Therefore, there are 23 packets of kerosene in total, and the total cost of all these packets is Rs. 6900.
Response:  We know that Lucia bought 2 packets of kerosene worth Rs. 12 each and spent Rs. 56 in total. Now, we need to find out how many packets of kerosene Lucia bought. So, let's divide the total amount she spent (Rs. 56) by the price of one packet of kerosene (Rs. 12):  Rs. 56 / Rs. 12 = 4.5 packets of kerosene. Therefore, Lucia bought 4.5 packets of kerosene.
Response:  We have 12 balls in total and we need to divide them equally among 4 baskets. So, each basket will get 3 balls (12 / 4 = 3). Now, there are 36 small boxes in each basket, and each box can hold 3 balls (3 x 36 = 108). Therefore, the number of balls that can fit in each basket is 108.
Response:  We have 7 balls in total and we need to put them into 4 baskets. So, each basket will contain how many balls?  Since there are 12 balls in total, each basket can hold 12/4 = 3 balls. Now, we have placed 3 balls in one basket, so there are 3 - 3 = 0 balls left over. Therefore, the number of balls remaining in the basket is 0.
Response:  We have 13 balls in total and we started with 4 balls in Bas's basket. So, there are 9 remaining balls. Now, how many balls will Bas get if he takes 3 balls from his basket? There are now 6 balls left in Bas's basket. Therefore, Bas will get 3 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many gote are there in total and then calculate the percentage of gotes that are left after 11 trains pass through them. So, let's assume the number of gotes at the starting point is 11. Now, each train passes through 7 gotes, so after 11 trains pass through, the number of gotes left will be = 11 - (7 x 11) = 11 - 77 = 64. Therefore, the percentage of gotes left after 11 trains pass through them is (64/111) x 100% = 58%.

Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in total and then calculate the number of students who are not present in the program.  So, let's first calculate the total number of students.  There are 174 teachers and 521 students in the school.  Therefore, the total number of students is:  Total Number of Students = 521 + 174 = 695 Now, we need to find out how many students are not present in the program.  According to the question, 30 students are absent from the program.  Therefore, the number of students who are not present in the program is:  Number of Students Not Present in Program = 30
Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in total and then calculate the number of students who are absent from each class.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many students are there in total?  From the given information, we know that there are 61 teachers and 177 students in total. Therefore, the total number of students is 61 x 177 = 10593. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question - How many students are absent from each class? According to the question, 44 students are absent from Class A, 28 students are absent from Class B, and 32 students are absent from Class C. Therefore, the total number of absentees is 44 + 28 + 32 = 104.
"Response:  We know that Gupha is located at an altitude of 919 feet (274 meters) above sea level and Osbh is located at an altitude of 1307 feet (398 meters) above sea level. To find out how far Gupha is from Osbh, we need to subtract their altitudes. So, the distance between Gupha and Osbh is:

Gupha - Osbh = 919 - 1307 = -388 feet or -118 meters

Therefore, Gupha is approximately 118 meters away from Osbh."
Response:  We know that Gupha is at an altitude of 1218 meters and wants to reach Osho's ashram which is located at an altitude of 849 meters. To find out how many steps Gupha needs to take to reach Osho's ashram, we need to calculate the difference in altitude between the two locations. The difference in altitude is: Altitude of Osho's ashram - Altitude of Gupha = 849 - 1218 = -369 meters. Since Gupha is already at an altitude of 1218 meters, it means that it will have to descend by 369 meters to reach Osho's ashram. Therefore, Gupha will need to take 369 steps to reach Osho's ashram.
Response:  We know that O is at an altitude of 659 feet and Gufa is at an altitude of 762 feet. To find out how far Gufa is from O, we need to subtract their altitudes. So, Gufa is 762 - 659 = 83 feet away from O.
"Response:  We have 6 sunhari mushrooms and we want to put them in a pot of water. The weight of each mushroom is approximately 0.1 kg (based on my rough calculation). So, the total weight of 6 sunhari mushrooms would be:

Weight of 6 sunhari mushrooms = 6 x 0.1 kg = 0.6 kg

Now, let's assume that the goldfish has a weight of around 0.5 kg (again based on my rough calculation). So, if we add the weight of the mushrooms to the weight of the goldfish, we get:

Total weight = Goldfish weight + Mushroom weight = 0.5 kg + 0.6 kg = 1.1 kg

Therefore, the answer is 1.1 kg."
Response:  We have to find out how many cats can fit in a box of size 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 3 inches high.  To do this, we need to use the formula for volume of a rectangular prism, which is V = lwh, where l is length, w is width, and h is height.  In this case, the length of the box is 12 inches, the width is 6 inches, and the height is 3 inches, so the volume of the box is V = 12 x 6 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.  Now, let's convert the volume from cubic inches to liters. There are 1000 milliliters (mL) in 1 liter, so we can divide the volume in cubic inches by 1000 to get the volume in mL. Doing this gives us V = 72 / 1000 = 0.072 liters.  Finally, we want to know how many cats can fit in the box. The average cat weight is around 4 kg (8.8 pounds), and each cat needs about 0.5 liters of space to move around comfortably. So, to calculate the number of cats that can fit in the box, we can divide the volume of the box by the amount of space needed per cat: N = V / (W x H), where W is the width of the box and H is its height. Substituting the values given in the question, we get N = 0.072 liters / (6 inches x 3 inches) = approximately 2.33 cats. Therefore, based on these calculations, we can estimate that approximately 2-3 cats can fit in the box.
Response:  We have to find out how many goldfish are in Page 16 and how many cats are in Page 71.  From Page 16, we know that there are 80 goldfish.  From Page 71, we know that there are 49 cats. So, the total number of goldfish and cats together is 80 + 49 = 129. Therefore, the answer is 129.
"Response:  We have to find out how much goldfish can eat in one day.  The weight of the goldfish is given as 15 tonnes.  If we assume that each goldfish eats half a kilogram of food per day (which is a reasonable estimate), then the total amount of food that all the goldfish in the pond can eat in a day would be:

15 tonnes x 0.5 kg/day = 7.5 tons of food per day

So, there are 7.5 tons of food available for all the goldfish in the pond to eat every day."
"Response:  After the fire broke out in the kitchen, two apples were saved from the ashes. Now let's calculate how many apples are left after the fire.  From the given information, we know that there were initially 43 apples in the basket. Since 2 apples were saved from the ashes, the number of apples left in the basket is:

Number of apples left = Initial number of apples - Number of apples saved from ashes
= 43 - 2
= 41

Therefore, there are 41 apples left in the basket after the fire."
Response:  We have a rectangular box with dimensions of length 58 inches and width 35 inches. The height of the box is not given in the question. To find out how many seeds can fit inside the box, we need to calculate the volume of the box first. Volume = Length x Width x Height = 58 x 35 x? = 2067 cubic inches Now, we know that there are 16 seeds per square inch. So, to find out how many seeds will fit in the box, we divide the volume of the box by the area of one seed: Number of seeds = Volume / Area of one seed = 2067 / 0.064 = 329 seeds Therefore, there will be 329 seeds inside the box.
Response:  We have to find out how many seeds are in 40 apples and how much space is required for growing those seeds.  So, firstly we need to calculate the number of seeds in 40 apples.  There are approximately 3-4 seeds in each apple. Therefore, the total number of seeds in 40 apples will be: Number of seeds = Total number of apples x Number of seeds per apple = 40 x 3 = 120 seeds Now, let's come to the second part of the question. The passage mentions that the area required for growing these seeds is 39 square meters. To find out how many seeds can be grown in an area of 39 square meters, we need to divide the area by the size of one seed bed (which is 1 meter x 1 meter = 1 square meter). Therefore, the number of seed beds that can be grown in an area of 39 square meters will be: Number of seed beds = Area available / Size of one seed bed = 39 / 1 = 39 seed beds So, to summarize, there are 120 seeds in 40 apples, and 39 seed beds can be grown in an area of 39 square meters.
"Response:  We have to find out how many questions are there in each section and then calculate the total number of questions.  Section A has 11 questions, so we can write:

Section A: 11 questions

Section B has 40 questions, so we can write:

Section B: 40 questions

Now, let's find out how many questions are there in each section:

Section A: 11/4 = 2.75 questions per sheet (round off to 3)
Section B: 40/4 = 10 questions per sheet (round off to 10)

So, there are 3 sheets in each lot, and each sheet has 3 questions from Section A and 10 questions from Section B. Therefore, the total number of questions is:

Total Number of Questions = 3 x 3 + 10 x 4 = 39 + 40 = 79 questions

Therefore, there are 79 questions in the entire examination."
Response:  We have to find out how much space each shelf takes and then calculate the total area of all the shelves.  Each shelf takes up 10 square feet of space, so there are 10 x 8 = 80 square feet of space taken up by the shelves. Now, we need to find out how many shelves fit in one wall. Since each shelf is 2 feet wide, there can be 20 shelves (2 ft/shelf) in one wall. Therefore, the total number of shelves that can fit in one wall is 20. Now, let's calculate the total area of all the shelves that can fit in one wall. The area of each shelf is 10 square feet, so the total area of all the shelves in one wall is 10 x 20 = 200 square feet. Finally, we need to divide the total area of all the shelves by the total area of the room to get the percentage of the room occupied by the shelves. So, the percentage of the room occupied by the shelves is 200 / 400 = 50%.
"Response:  We have to find out how many cubes can fit in each shelf of the cabinet.  There are 10 shelves in total.  Each shelf has a height of 2 feet (60 inches). So, we need to divide the height of each shelf by the length of one cube (which is equal to half the width of the cabinet) to get an estimate of how many cubes can fit in each shelf.  Therefore, the number of cubes that can fit in each shelf is:

$$ \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 $$

So, there can be 4 cubes in each shelf. Now, let's calculate the total number of cubes that can fit in the entire cabinet:

$$ Total = 10 \times 4 = 40 $$

Therefore, there are 40 cubes in total that can fit in the cabinet."
Response:  We have 544 bags of rice and each bag contains 32 tons. So, in total, we have 544 x 32 = 17068 tons of rice. Now, let's calculate how many flowers are there in total. Each flower is equal to 32 tons / 544 bags = 0.06 tons per bag. Therefore, the total number of flowers are 17068 tons / 0.06 tons per bag = 284133 bags.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers and leaves are there in each bartan and then sum them up to get the total number of flowers and leaves in all the bartans together. So, let's start with the first bartan - it has 53 flowers and 181 leaves. Now, we need to multiply these numbers by 46 to get the total number of flowers and leaves in that one bartan alone. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the first bartan is 53 x 46 = 2492 flowers. Similarly, the total number of leaves in the first bartan is 181 x 46 = 8464 leaves. Now, let's move on to the second bartan - it has 47 flowers and 143 leaves. Again, we need to multiply these numbers by 46 to get the total number of flowers and leaves in that one bartan alone. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the second bartan is 47 x 46 = 2092 flowers. The total number of leaves in the second bartan is 143 x 46 = 6494 leaves. Now, let's continue this process for all the remaining bartans. In total, there are 46 bartans, so we need to multiply the number of flowers and leaves in each bartan by 46 to get the total number of flowers and leaves in all the bartans together. Therefore, the total number of flowers in all the bartans is 46 x 2492 = 11,768 flowers. Similarly, the total number of leaves in all the bartans is 46 x 8464 = 37,844 leaves. Thus, the final answer is 11,768 flowers and 37,844 leaves.
Response:  We have 141 bartans and each bartan has 71 taels of flowers and 91 taels of leaves. So, in total, we have: 141 Bartans x 71 Taels of Flowers = 9831 Taels of Flowers 141 Bartans x 91 Taels of Leaves = 12691 Taels of Leaves Total amount of flowers + Total amount of leaves = 9831 + 12691 = 22522 Taels
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers are in each pot and then multiply it with the total number of pots to get the total number of flowers. So, let's first calculate the number of flowers in each pot. According to the question, there are 40 flowers in each pot. Now, we need to find out how many pots there are in total. From the question, we know that there are 400 pots in total. Therefore, the total number of flowers is: Number of flowers in each pot x Total number of pots = 40 flowers/pot x 400 pots = 16,000 flowers.
Response:  We have 4502 skittles in total and 4276 of them are red. So, there are 226 blue skittles. Now, let's assume that each group of 154 skittles has an equal number of red and blue skittles. Therefore, there will be 154/2 = 77 red skittles and 77 blue skittles in each group.
Response:  We have 3941 scooters and 4950 rubber bands. Each scooter requires 495 rubber bands. So, we need (3941 x 495) = 187625 rubber bands in total to produce all the scooters.
Response:  We have 896 skittles in total and we want to distribute them equally among 517 groups of 90 each. So, we need to divide 896 by 517 which gives us 1.73 skittles per group.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each grade has 5 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of grades = Number of students / Number of students per grade.  In this case, the total number of grades is equal to 270 / 5 = 54 grades. Therefore, there are 54 grades in the school.
Response:  School has 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, total number of students in school is = 304 x 75 = 22,550 students.
