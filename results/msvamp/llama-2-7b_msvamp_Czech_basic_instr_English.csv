Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 new beetles and already had 6 old ones in his collection before he went to the park. Therefore, the total number of beetles he found in the park is 50 + 6 = 56. Since he threw away 6 beetles, that means he has 56 - 6 = 50 beetlies left in his collection after throwing them away. So, he found 30 more beetles than he threw away (50 - 6 = 34)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, Danny threw away 54 old tickets and found 48 new ones in the park. This means he had 52 tickets left after finding the new ones. To find out how many more tickets Danny threw away than he found, subtract the number of tickets he found (48) from the total number of tickets he threw away (54): 54 - 48 = 6. Therefore, Danny threw away 6 additional tickets beyond those he found in the park."

Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 of them to Jeff. Therefore, she still has 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106)."
Response: 200
Response: 40
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave Jeff some of them, resulting in Jeff having 535 cards now. Therefore, the difference between the number of cards Nell had and the number of cards Jeff has is equal to the number of cards Jeff received from Nell, which is 31."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 tens before she gave some to Jeff. Now, Nell has 415 baseball cards and 149 tens, which means that she has 26 more baseball cards than she did initially. Since each deck of baseball cards contains 10 cards, Nell has 26 x 10 = 260 more baseball cards than she did initially. Therefore, Nell has 309 + 260 = 569 baseball cards in total, including both her original collection and the ones she received from Jeff."
"Response: 78
Explanation: According to the passage, Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 decks before she gave some of her cards to Jeff. If she gave him ""pár"" (which means ""a few"") of her cards, then she must have given him fewer than half of them. Therefore, the number of cards she has left is equal to the total number of cards she had minus the number of cards she gave to Jeff. In this case, that's 246 - 49 = 207. Since each deck contains 10 cards, the number of decks she has left is 207 / 10 = 20 decks. So, Nell has 78 additional decks."
Response: 40
Response: 26
"Response: 54
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card packs. If she gave Jeff some of her cards and now has 376 ten-card packs and 111 baseball cards, then the number of additional tens that Nell has is equal to the difference between the total number of cards she had (239 + 38 = 277) and the number of cards she currently has (376 + 111 = 487). Therefore, the answer is 54."

Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 2 children in the bus, and then 4 more children got on at the stop. Therefore, there are now 6 children (2 + 4) more than the initial number of children in the bus."
Response: 64 children are currently in the bus.
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were initially ""nějaké"" children who boarded the bus. Then, two more children got off at a stop, leaving a total of 41 children in the bus. Therefore, there were 20 children in the bus before the stop."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children on the bus. When they arrived at the bus stop, 21 children got off the bus, leaving 22 children still on the bus."
"Response: 33
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There were 41 children in the bus before they got off at the stop.
* After getting off, there were 18 children left in the bus.

So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children remaining in the bus minus the initial number of children in the bus.

Number of children who got off = Number of children remaining - Initial number of children
= 18 - 41
= -23

Since the result is negative, it means that there were more children in the bus after they got off than there were before they got off. Therefore, the correct answer is 33 (the difference between the initial and final numbers)."
Response: 10
Response: 5 - 6 = 1
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There were initially 36 children on the bus.
* At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus.
* Some more children boarded the bus.
* After these events, there were 12 children left inside the bus.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the initial number of children and the final number of children:

Initial number of children - Final number of children = 36 - 12 = 24

So, there were 24 more children who got off the bus than the number of children who originally boarded it (i.e., 68 - 36 = 32)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 22 children on the bus. Then, 40 children got off at the stop and some of them stepped onto the bus again. Finally, two children got off the bus. Therefore, the number of children who stepped onto the bus is equal to the number of children who got off minus the number of children who remained on the bus, which is 40 - 2 = 38."
"Response: 14
Explanation:
The number of children who got into the bus is 82 - 28 = 54. The number of children who got off the bus is 30. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got onto and off the bus is 54 - 30 = 24. So, there are 14 more children in the bus than those who got off it."

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Pekárna (bakery) made 133 Kolaches and sold 51 of them.
So, the number of Kolaches that the baker made more than he sold is:
133 - 51 = 82
Therefore, the baker made 42 more Kolaches than he sold."
"Response: 13
Explanation: The total number of kolaches made by the bakery is 54. If some were sold, then the number of unsold kolaches is equal to the number of kolaches sold minus the number of kolaches used for sale. In this case, if 13 kolaches were sold, then there are 41 unsold kolaches (54 - 13 = 41)."
"Response: 72

Explanation:
The total number of colaches sold is 145. If there are 72 remaining colaches, then the baker made 73 colaches (145 - 72 = 73)."

"Response: 26

Explanation:
The statement ""Prodal jich 91"" means that the bakery sold 91 doughnuts. The statement ""Koupil 154 nových"" means that Baker bought 154 new doughnuts.

"Response: 42

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
Pekárník (the baker) made 170 rolls and sold 78 of them. He also bought 31 new rolls. Therefore, the total number of rolls that Pekárník had after buying some new ones is:
170 - 31 = 139

Now, we need to find out how many more rolls Baker sold than he bought. To do this, we can subtract the number of rolls that Baker bought from the number of rolls that he sold:
78 - 31 = 47

Therefore, Baker sold 47 more rolls than he bought."
"Response: 24
Explanation: The total number of kolachkes made is given as 110 + 76 = 186. Since 75 were sold, that leaves 111 remaining (186 - 75). So, the baker still needs to make 24 more kolaches."
"Response: 23
Explanation:

Explanation: If Pekárník made 149 Kolaches and 91 Pečiva, and he sold 10 Doughnuts and 90 Pečiva, then Baker has to make 32 Doughnuts more."
"Response: 269

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Pekárna made 7 Kolaches and 148 Pečiva. If he sold 15 Doughnuts and 103 Pečiva, then he has X Pečiva left.
We know that the total number of Pečiva produced is 148 + 103 = 251.
So, X = 251 - 15 - 103 = 269.
Therefore, Baker has 269 Pečiva left."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Baker made 30 more doughnuts than bread rolls. Therefore, if he sold 115 doughnuts and 81 bread rolls, he must have made 30 more doughnuts than the number of bread rolls he sold. So, the number of doughnuts he made is 30 + 81 = 111."
"Response: 42
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the pekárna (bakery) made 19 Kolaches and 131 pieces of bread. When it sold 70 doughnuts and 88 pieces of bread, it means that the bakery produced more bread than doughnuts. Specifically, the bakery produced 131 - 70 = 61 pieces of bread more than doughnuts. Therefore, the pekárna produced 42 pieces of bread more than doughnuts."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Pekárník made 157 doughnuts and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 doughnuts and 147 pastries, then Baker sold 30 doughnuts."
"Response: 70

Explanation:
The total number of pečiva made by the baker is given as 143 + 92 = 235. If he sold 68 colačů and 92 pečiva, then he must have sold all of his remaining pečiva (i.e., 235 - 92 = 143). Therefore, the baker sold an additional 70 pieces of pečiva."

"Response: 27
Explanation: The total number of kolachkes made by the baker is 173 + 103 = 276. Since he sold 86 and bought 103 new doughnuts, he has 276 - 86 - 103 = 97 kolaches left."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the passage, Pekárník made 99 colaches and bought 167 new ones. Then he sold 89 of them. To find out how many more colaches Baker bought before selling any, we need to subtract the number of colaches he sold from the total number of colaches he bought: 167 - 89 = 78. Therefore, Baker bought 78 additional colaches before selling any."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker sold 26 more dentures than he bought. This is because he sold 145 dentures and bought 139 dentures. Therefore, the difference between the number of dentures sold and the number of dentures bought is 26."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The baker made a total of 211 colachs (62 + 149). He sold 144 of them. Therefore, he has 7 colaches left (211 - 144 = 7)."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
The total number of pastries made by Pekárník is given as 81 + 92 = 173. Since he sold only 46 pastries, that means he had 127 left over (173 - 46). Therefore, Baker must have made more than 127 pastries, but less than 173, since he sold 46. So the difference between the number of pastries Baker made and the number he sold is 46 - 127 = -81."
"Response: 29
Explanation: If Pekárník sold 108 dentists and 44 pečivas, he would have 35 (108 - 73) dentists left. Since Baker wants to buy all of Pekárník's remaining dentists, Baker needs 29 dentists from Pekárník."
"Response: 38
Explanation: If Pekárník sold 104 dentists and 29 pečivas, he would have 75 pečivas left (124 - 104 = 75). Therefore, Baker needs to make 38 more pečivas than what Pekárník has left."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Baker made 36 more doughnuts than he sold. This is because he sold 102 doughnuts but only produced 52 doughnuts. Therefore, Baker made 36 additional doughnuts beyond what he sold."

"Response: 26
Explanation: If Pekárna made 14 doughnuts and 153 pastries, and sold 8 pastries and 97 doughnuts, then Baker sold 26 doughnuts."
"Response: 26

Explanation:
The total number of pečiva and koláče sold by the baker is given as 154 + 78 = 232. Since the baker sold 114 pečiva and 43 koláči, he must have sold an additional 26 pečiva to make up for the difference between the total number of items sold and the number of items he had available (i.e., 232 - 114 - 43 = 26)."

Explanation:
The given information is that daily they pick 66 pytles of oranges and each pytle contains 28 oranges. To find out how many oranges are picked daily, we can divide the total number of pytles by the number of pytles containing oranges per day:

Total number of pytles = 66
Number of pytles containing oranges per day = 66 / 28 = 2.4
So, they pick 2.4 x 28 = 71.2 oranges daily."

Response: 1400 (or 1400 pomerančů)
Response: 8 pytlů/day x 35 pomerančů/pytel = 280 pomerančů/day
"Response: 4 days  
Explanation: According to the question, they are currently producing 16 pytles of pomerances per day. To produce 80 pytles in total, it will take 4 times as long, or 4 days."
Response: 35 x 12 = 420 pomerančů
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have 3980 pytlů (74 x 51) of oranges.
"Response: 1280
Explanation: According to the question, 64 pytle are thrown away every day, which means that 64 x 50 = 3200 pomeranches are harvested daily. Therefore, the number of pomeranches harvested daily is 3200 - 64 = 3136."

"Response: 130 pytlů
Explanation: If they are currently sklízeining 65 pytlů of unripe oranges per day and it takes 6 days for them to ripen completely, then after 6 days they will have 65 x 6 = 390 pytlů of unripe oranges. Since some of these will also ripen into ripe oranges, we can subtract the number of ripe oranges they already have (46 pytlů) from this total to get the remaining unripe oranges: 390 - 46 = 344 pytlů. So, after 6 days there will be 344 pytlů of unripe oranges left to be harvested."

Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 stops and its width is 11 stops. Therefore, her room is longer than it is wide.
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is 3 meters (16 cubic feet).
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 6 meters (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 13 meters.
"Response: 40
Explanation: The length and width of the room are given as 3 meters each, so the area of the room is 3 x 3 = 9 square meters. Since the carpet has to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of one square meter (which is equal to 10 square feet) to find out how many squares of carpet we need: 9 / 10 = 90 square feet. Therefore, we need 90/12 = 7.5 pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
The area of one square foot is equal to 0.1 square yards. Therefore, the area of each square yard is equal to 0.1 square feet. Since the room is 20 feet long and 12 feet wide, its total area can be calculated as follows:

Area = Length x Width = 20 ft x 12 ft = 240 sq ft
Since we want to cover the entire floor with tiles that are 4 square feet in size, we will need:

Number of Tiles = Total Area / Size of Each Tile = 240 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 60 tiles
Therefore, there will be 60 tiles needed to cover the entire floor of the room."
Response: 400 cubic feet (or 10,764 cubic meters)
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 6 meters and its width is 6 meters, making it 6 x 6 = 36 square meters in area. Since the length is greater than the width (6 > 6), the room is longer than it is wide, so its volume is greater than its surface area.
Response:  The width of her room is 2 stops (since 5 x 2 = 10).
Response:  The length of her room is 5 steps (délka = 2 + 3).
"Response: 36
Explanation:  To find out how many cubes of carpet Jesse needs for the entire floor, we need to multiply the length and width of her room. The length is 4 times 18 = 72 feet, and the width is 20 times 18 = 360 feet. Therefore, Jesse needs 36 cubes of carpet for the entire floor."

Explanation:
To calculate how much money Lewis will earn in total over 73 seasons, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works per season and then sum up all these products.

So, if Lewis earns $1357 per week, and there are 223 weeks in a season, he will work for 73 seasons, which means he will work for a total of:

$$ \text {Total weeks} = 223 \times 73 = 16,091 \text{ weeks} $$

Now, let's calculate his total income over 73 seasons:

$$ \text {Total income} = 1357 \times 16,091 = 21,673,330 \text{ dollars} $$

"Response: 25 feet
Explanation:  If Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than he is (i.e., 10 x 9 = 90 feet), then the depth of the water is 90 - 9 = 81 feet below Dean's height."
Response:  The depth of the water was twice Dean's height, which is 8 feet (2 x 5 = 10). Since Dean is 6 feet tall, and Ron is 8 stops above him, Ron must be at least 14 + 8 = 22 feet away from the surface.
"Response: 50 feet
Explanation:  According to the passage, ""Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron,"" which means that Dean is 3 meters less than Ron's height. Since Ron stands at 12 steps (which is equal to 12 x 3 = 36 feet), and Dean is 3 meters shorter than Ron, then Dean stands at 36 - 3 = 33 feet. The depth of the water is five times greater than Ron's height, so the depth of the water would be 5 x 36 = 180 feet."
"Response: 20 meters (or 66 feet)

Question:  Po odpočinku se rozhodli jít plavat. Hloubka vody je 15krát vyšší než Deanovo výška. Dean je o metr vyšší než Ron. Jestliže Ron stojí na 13 stopách, jak hluboká byla voda?  
Please provide a brief explanation of how you arrived at your answer.  Explanation:  To find the depth of the water, we need to use the given information and the fact that Dean is one meter taller than Ron. We can start by using the formula for finding an unknown distance in meters: distance = height x gear ratio. In this case, the height is Dean's height minus Ron's height, which is 2 meters (Dean - Ron). The gear ratio is 15 times higher than Dean's height, or 15 x 2 = 30 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water is 30 meters."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation:  According to the passage, ""Dean is nine inches taller than Ron,"" which means that Dean's height is 9 + 5 = 14 inches (or 1 foot) greater than Ron's height. Since Ron is 13 steps away from shore, and each step is 2 feet tall, then Ron is currently standing at a depth of 13 x 2 = 26 feet below sea level. Therefore, if they decide to go swimming after their break, the water will be 26 + 14 = 38 feet deep."
"Response: 9 x (Dean's height) + 5 =? meters

Solution:
Let Dean's height be D meters. Since the depth of water is 9 times greater than Dean's height, we can write:

H = 9D

Now, we are told that Ron is 5 meters tall. So, we can find Dean's height by subtracting Ron's height from the total depth of water:

D = H - 5

Substituting the expression for H into this equation, we get:

D = 9D - 5

Simplifying and solving for D, we get:

D = 45 meters

Therefore, the depth of water was 45 meters."

Response: 360 places (98 students / 7 buses).
"Response: 3600 students
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an average of 30 students (which is a reasonable assumption for a primary school). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of classes as follows:
Number of classes = Number of tříd x Number of students per třída
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
Since there are 95 school buses and 118 seats in each bus, we know that the total number of students who can go on the field trip is equal to the number of seats available on the buses minus the number of students who cannot go (e.g., those who do not have transportation or who live too far away to walk). So, the number of students who can go on the field trip is:
Total number of students who can go on the field trip = Total number of students - Number of students who cannot go
= 2520 -?
Now, let's use the information provided in the question to find out how many students cannot go on the field trip. We know that 95 school buses are fully occupied, which means that 95 x 118 = 11,270 students are already accounted for (i.e., they will be going on the field trip). This leaves us with:
Total number of students who can go on the field trip = 2520 - 11,270
= 14,030 students
Therefore, there are approximately 14,030 students in the school."
"Response: 10
Explanation: If there are 67 classes in total and each class has 66 students, then the total number of students is 67 x 66 = 4282. Since there are 6 seats in each school bus, we need 4282 / 6 = 10 buses to accommodate all the students for the field trip."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students (58 students / 87 classes = 0.66 students/class). Since there are two seats in each bus, we need at least one bus for every 0.66 students (2 / 0.66 = 3.04 buses). Therefore, we will need 4 buses to accommodate all the students on the field trip."
"Response: 30 students
Explanation: Let's assume that each class has the same number of students as there are classes in total (i.e., 24 x 120 = 2880 students). Since there are 84 seats available in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to find out how many students will be in each bus: 2880 / 84 = 35 students per bus. As there are 2 buses, the total number of students who will go on the field trip is 35 x 2 = 70 students. Therefore, each class will have 70/24 = 30 students."
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 66 classes and 102 students in total, then each bus can hold 8 students. So, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, we need 3 buses to transport them."
Response: 34 students will go on the field trip.
"Response: 48
Explanation: If there are 72 classes in total and each class has 3 students, then the number of students going on the field trip is 72 x 3 = 216. Since each bus can hold 3 students, we need 216 / 3 = 72 buses for the entire group to fit comfortably. Therefore, 48 buses will be needed for the field trip."
"Response: 46
Explanation: If there are 46 students in total and 17 classes, then each class has an average of 2.6 students (46/17). Since each bus can seat at most 50 people (according to the problem), we know that at least 3 buses will be needed for the entire group (50 - 2.6 = 3). Therefore, there will be 3 x 46 = 138 passengers in total, or 138 / 50 = 2.76 buses."
"Response: 45
Explanation: If each boy had 9 kulicheks and there are 11 boys, then the total number of kulicheks is 11 x 9 = 99. However, since Haley gave each boy 9 kulicheks, the total number of kulicheks given by Haley is 9 x 11 = 99. Therefore, the correct answer is 45."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave each of the four boys 5 kuliček (kuličky), so in total she gave them 20 kuliček (4 x 5)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for himself, that means he will have 9 marbles left to share with the other boys. Since there are 4 boys in total, each boy will get 9/4 = 2 marbles from Haley. Therefore, each boy will get 7 marbles."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, there are 13 boys who love playing marbles and 50 boys who love playing cards. If Haley has 26 marbles, then each of the 13 boys will get 26 / 13 = 2 marbles."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, there are 20 marbles in total and they will be divided equally among the boys in the class. Since there are 5 boys in the class, each boy will receive 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4)."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave each of the five boys two marbles, so she gave them in total 10 marbles (5 x 2 = 10). Since there were originally 28 marbles, and Haley gave away half of them, there must have been 14 marbles left over after she gave them away (28 - 10 = 14)."

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Frank read his favorite book for 569 days.
* He read 22 pages per day.

To find out how many pages are in the book, we can use the formula: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of pages per day.
Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:
Number of pages = 569 days / 22 pages/day = 25931 pages
Therefore, there are 25931 pages in Frank's favorite book."
"Response: 35
Explanation:
The book had 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. If it took Frank six days to finish reading the book, then he read x pages per day, where x is the number of pages in one chapter. Since there are 24 chapters, each chapter has x/24 pages. Therefore, Frank read 35 pages per day (x/24)."
"Response: 17

"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read his favorite book for eight pages per day (8). If he started reading the book when it had 576 pages (576), and he reads eight pages per day, then it will take him ten days to finish reading the book (576 / 8 = 72 days)."
Response: 27 pages/day
Response: 3 x 594 = 1782
"Response: 2
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it took Frank 664 days (or 18 years) to read his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages and there are two chapters per day, Frank would have read one chapter per day. Therefore, he read 2 chapters per day."

If each DVD box costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 per box, then you can buy 4 boxes for $93 ($106 x 4 = $428)."
"Response:  $51
Explanation:
To find out how much you need to pay for each DVD, we can use the following formula:
Cost = Original price - Discount
In this case, the original price of each DVD is $76, and there is a discount of $25 (or 30%) off that price. So, the cost of each DVD after the discount is:
Cost = $76 - ($76 x 30%) = $76 - $22.80 = $53.20
Therefore, you will have to pay $53.20 for each DVD."
"Response: 4
Explanation: To find out how many DVD boxes you can buy with $104, we need to divide the amount of money by the cost of each box. Since each box costs $26, you can buy 4 boxes ($104 / $26 = 4)."

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* In the day before, there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* In the current day, there are 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace in the current day than in the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors in the previous day from the number of visitors in the current day:

317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, 22 more visitors visited Buckingham Palace in the current day than in the previous day."

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before dinner was 100.
* There were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before.

To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace after dinner, we need to subtract the number of visitors before dinner from the total number of visitors the day before:

666 - 100 = 566

So, there were 566 visitors who visited Buckingham Palace after dinner."
"Response: 406 - 132 = 274

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days is given as 406. The number of visitors during the day of the event is given as 132. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 327 days minus the number of visitors during the day of the event. This gives us an answer of 274."

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace during the previous day was 45.
* The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last 85 days was 829.

To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that particular day, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors on that day = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors the previous day
= 829 / 45
= 1036

Therefore, the answer to the question is 1036."
"Response: 557 - 188 = 369

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is that there were 71 paintings in the Buckingham Palace and that 557 visitors came to the palace on the day in question. The previous day, there were 188 visitors. To find out how many visitors visited the palace during the 57-day period, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day. Therefore, the answer is 557 - 188 = 369."
"Response: 71
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
• The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after (661) - The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before (600) = 61
Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on the two days is 61."

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* Before yesterday (i.e., 1 day ago), there were 419 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* Yesterday (i.e., today), there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace before today, we need to subtract the number of visitors yesterday from the number of visitors before yesterday:

419 - 92 = 327

So, before today, 327 people visited Buckingham Palace."
"Response: 512 - 471 = 41

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace during the last 89 days is calculated by subtracting the number of visitors from the previous day (471) from the current number of visitors (512). Therefore, the answer is 41."
"Response: 368

Explanation:
Let's call the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace on day t as B(t). We know that B(day-1) = 191 and B(day-2) = 457. Also, we are told that there were 705 visitors on the day in question. Therefore, we can write the equation:

B(day) - B(day-1) + B(day-2) = 705

Simplifying this equation, we get:

B(day) = 191 + (705 - 191) = 368

So, there were 368 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question than there were in the previous 245 days."

Response: 18 sudes of grapes per day.
Response: 530 sudes hroznů.
Response: 46 sudes of grapes.
"Response: 394 sudes

Explanation:
The given information can be used to calculate the total number of sudes (measured in liters) that would be filled during 58 days. The daily production is 108 sudes per 252 workers, which means each worker produces 0.426 sudes per day (108/252). Therefore, the total number of sudes produced over 58 days is:

Total sudes = Daily production x Number of days
= 0.426 sudes/day x 58 days
= 23.66 sudes

So, there would be approximately 23.66 sudes (or 23.66 liters) of wine produced every day for 58 days."
"Response: 5 days

Explanation:
The given information is that there are 36 wine beggars who fill up 8 jugs of wine per day. To find out how many days it will take to fill up 240 jugs, we can multiply the number of beggars by the number of jugs they fill per day:

Number of days = Number of beggars x Number of jugs filled per day
= 36 x 8
= 288

So, it will take approximately 5 days (288 / 56) to fill up 240 jugs of wine."

Explanation: According to the question, the postman must give 5 pieces of unhealthy mail to each block. Since there are 25 letters in total that the postman is giving to each block, and since each block has 5 pieces of unhealthy mail, then there are 25 / 5 = 10 houses in each block."
"Response: 180
Explanation:
The total number of houses in all blocks is given as 20 x 3 = 60 houses. Since each block has 5 houses that did not receive any mail, the total number of houses that did not receive any mail is 60 x 5 = 300 houses. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 9 kusy of unhealthy mail to each of the remaining 300 houses, for a total of 9 x 300 = 2700 pieces of unhealthy mail."
"Response: 6 x 24 = 144

Explanation:
The question states that there are six houses in one block and the postman needs to deliver 24 incomplete letters to each house. Therefore, the total number of incomplete letters he needs to deliver is 6 x 24 = 144."
"Response: 50
Explanation:
The number of houses in each block is given as 14. Since there are two packages of unhealthy mail to be delivered to each block, and one block has 14 houses, then there will be 28 packages of unhealthy mail (14 x 2 = 28) to be delivered overall. Therefore, there are 50 houses in total (14 houses per block x 5 blocks)."
"Response: 48
Explanation: To determine how many pieces of incomplete mail the postman needs to deliver to each block, we need to multiply the number of homes in each block (20) by the total number of blocks (5). So, the postman needs to deliver 100 pieces of incomplete mail (20 x 5 = 100) to all the homes in the five blocks combined."
"Response: 5
Explanation:
The total number of kusy nezdravé pošty that the postman must deliver is 30. Since there are 78 blocks in total, each block has an average of 2.64 kusy (30 / 78).
Since there are 19 homes in each block, the postman needs to give 5 kusy unsolicited mail to each home (5 x 19 = 95). Therefore, the postman must deliver 5 kusy unsolicited mail to each of the 78 blocks, for a total of 390 kusy (5 x 78 = 390)."
Response:  There are 55 blocks in total, and each block has 8 houses. Therefore, there are 55 x 8 = 440 houses in total. When he sends 32 emails to each house in one of the blocks, there are 32 x 8 = 256 emails in that block alone.
"Response: 36
Explanation:
The total number of houses in all 81 blocks is 972 (81 x 12). Since the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 36 × 4 = 144 pieces of unwanted mail."
"Response: 280
Explanation:
The total number of houses in all 16 blocks is 17 x 16 = 252. Since the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, the total number of pieces of unwanted mail that need to be delivered is 252 x 4 = 1008. Therefore, the postman needs to give 280 pieces of unwanted mail (1008 - 728) back to the post office."

"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5, then she will have 20/5 = 4 groups of eggs and 6/5 = 1 group of marbles. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles by 4 - 1 = 3."
"Response: 3

Explanation: According to the question, if each large wooden plate requires two hammers, and John used four hammers to cut through the plates for the wall of his house, then he must have needed eight plates to cover the entire wall."
Response: 23 x 17 = 401 hřebíkové kusy + 8 = 409 hřebíkové kusy
"Response: 42

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let X be the number of planks needed for the wall.
We know that each large sheet requires 3 hinges for fixing and there are 11 large sheets in total. Therefore, the total number of hinges required is 11 x 3 = 33 hinges.
Now, we have additional 8 small sheets, which require 2 hinges each. So, the total number of hinges required for all 8 small sheets is 8 x 2 = 16 hinges.
Therefore, the total number of hinges used is 33 + 16 = 50 hinges.
Since one hinge is required to fix every 4 feet of the wall, we need 50 / 4 = 12.5 feet of hinges.
So, John needs 12.5 feet of hinges to fix the wall."
Response: 19 hřebíku
Response: 32 hřebíku
Response: 560 kusů hřebíků.
"Response:  To calculate how many nails (hřebíky) John needs to build the wall of his house, we need to multiply the number of large boards by the number of nails required per board and add it to the total number of nails needed for all small boards. Let's do this step-by-step:

Large boards:
Number of large boards = 12
Nails required per large board = 14
Total nails needed for large boards = 12 x 14 = 168

Small boards:
Number of small boards = 17
Nails required per small board = 25
Total nails needed for small boards = 17 x 25 = 425

Total number of nails needed for entire wall = Large boards + Small boards = 168 + 425 = 593
Therefore, John needs 593 nails to build the wall of his house."

Response:  Each group contains approximately 28 gum and 39 Skittles.
Response:  The size of each group is 495/3941 = 0.1276 or approximately 13 groups.
"Response: 43

Explanation:
The total number of Skittles is 896. If we divide this number by 8 (the number of groups), we get the total number of Skittles in each group: 112 Skittles per group. Since Steven also has 517 pieces of gum and 90 weights, he does not have enough to give one piece of gum or one weight to every member of each group. Therefore, there must be at least 4 people in each group (since you cannot divide 112 Skittles evenly among fewer than 4 people). So, the size of each group is at most 4 people."
"Response: 12
Explanation: If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then there will be 270 / 5 = 54 classes in total."
Response: 28,900 students. Explanation: If the school has 304 classes and each class has 75 students, then the total number of students in the school is: 304 x 75 = 21,000 students. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of students for one day as follows: 21,000 / 7 = 3,000 students per day. Therefore, the total number of students in the school over the course of a year (365 days) is: 3,000 x 365 = 1,095,000 students. However, since the question asks for the total number of students in the school, we need to subtract the number of classes that do not have any students (e.g., kindergarten or special education classes): 1,095,000 - 304 = 28,900 students.
