Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 18 children. On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 10 children. So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 18 - 10 = 8 more children. Therefore, there are 8 more children that Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 11 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  12 - 11 = 1 Therefore, there are 1 more child playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played with 5 children on Sunday (Isnin), and then she played with some kids on Monday (Selasa), we can assume that she played with more than 5 children on Monday.  So, if she played with 15 children on Monday, then she must have played with at least 10 additional children compared to Sunday (5 + 10 = 15). Therefore, there were 10 more children playing with Julia on Monday than on Sunday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Monday (Isnin), and she played with 16 children on Tuesday (Selasa), then we can say that:  Number of children Julia played with on Monday = 14  Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 16 - 14 = 2 So, there were 2 more children playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 16 children. If she also plays with another 12 children on Monday (Selasa), then the total number of children she played with on that day is: 16 + 12 = 28 children.
Response:  On Monday (Selasa), Julia played with 14 children. If she plays with 8 more children on Tuesday (Isnin), then the total number of children she played with on Tuesday is 14 + 8 = 22 children. Therefore, there are 22 children playing with Julia on Tuesday.
Response:  On Sunday (Isnin), Julia played with 17 children.  On Monday (Selasa), she played with 15 children.  On Tuesday (Rabu), she played with 2 children. Therefore, in total, Julia played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
"Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 15 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 18 children.  Therefore, the number of children that Julia played with on Monday is less than the number of children she played with on Tuesday. So, the answer to the question ""Berapa ramai anak yang dia main dengan pada hari Isnin"" is 15."
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 5 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 9 children.  On Wednesday (Rabu), she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with: 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children. Therefore, there were 30 children that Julia played with across these three days.
Response:  On Monday (Rabu), Julia played with 16 children. So, the number of children she played with on Monday is 16.  On Tuesday (Selasa), Julia played with 2 children. Therefore, the number of children she played with on Tuesday is 2.  Hence, the total number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 16 + 2 = 18.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 9 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 7 children.  On Wednesday (Rabu), she played with 96 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more children on Wednesday than on any other day. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with on Monday is less than the number of children she played with on Wednesday. In other words, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is 96 - 9 = 87.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 2 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 14 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  14 - 2 = 12 children. Therefore, there are 12 more children that Julia played with on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Selasa), Julia played with 11 children.  On Tuesday (Rabu), she played with 9 children. So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is:  11 - 9 = 2 more children played with Julia on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, there are 2 more children who played with Julia on Monday compared to Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 15 children.  On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 18 children.  And on Wednesday (Rabu), she played with 7 children. So, we can see that the number of children Julia played with decreases as the days go by:  Monday > Tuesday > Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is:  Difference = 15 - 7 = 8 children.
Response:  On Sunday (Isnin), Julia played with 13 children. On Monday (Selasa), she played with 10 children. On Tuesday (Rabu), she played with 15 children. Therefore, the total number of children that Julia played with is: 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Sunday (Isnin), Julia played with 7 children. On Monday (Selasa), she played with 13 children. On Tuesday (Rabu), she played with 20 children. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children.
Response:  On Sunday (Isnin), Julia played with 12 children for 3 hours = 3 x 3 = 9 hours.  On Monday (Selasa), she played with 14 children for 5 hours = 5 x 3 = 15 hours. So, in total, Julia spent 9 + 15 = 24 hours playing tag with different groups of children. Therefore, there were 24 / 2 = 12 children that Julia played with in total.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 19 children. On Tuesday (Selasa), she played with 18 children. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  19 - 18 = 1 So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (hari Selasa), Julia played with 5 children.  On Wednesday (hari Isnin), she played with 6 children more than on Monday (hari Selasa). So, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is 6 - 5 = 1 child. Therefore, there are 1 additional child playing with Julia on Wednesday compared to Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Isnin), Julia played with 4 children. So, there are 4 children playing with her on that day. Now, let's count how many children she plays with on Tuesday (Selasa). According to the question, Julia plays with 18 children in total. Since she already played with 4 children on Monday, that means she has 14 remaining children to play with on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia plays with 14 children on Tuesday.
Response:  On Wednesday (hari Rabu), Julia played with 4 children.  On Thursday (hari Isnin), she played with 6 children more than on Wednesday. So, the number of children she played with on Thursday is 6 + 4 = 10.  Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Thursday and Wednesday is 10 - 4 = 6.
Response:  If Bobby initially eats 10 pieces of candy, and then he eats an additional 25 pieces, the total number of candies he has eaten is:  10 + 25 = 35 pieces of candy. So, Bobby has eaten 35 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 28 pieces of gula-gula and then he ate 42 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of gula-gula.  Next, we are told that Bobby also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate is equal to 2 keping, Bobby ate 63 x 2 = 126 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 70 (gula-gula) + 126 (chocolate) = 196 sweets.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 33 keping gula-gula and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 keping gula-gula.  Next, we are told that Bobby also ate 14 keping coklat. Therefore, the total number of sweets Bobby ate is 37 (kping gula-gula) + 14 (kping coklat) = 51 sweets.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 38 pieces of gula-gula and then he ate 36 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 74 pieces of gula-gula (38 + 36 = 74). Now, we are asked how many more pieces of gula-gula Bobby ate than coklat. Since Bobby ate 16 pieces of coklat, the difference between the number of gula-gula and coklat that Bobby ate is 74 - 16 = 58. Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of gula-gula than coklat.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 20 pieces of sugar cane. Then he ate 34 more pieces, so the total number of pieces he ate is:  20 + 34 = 54 pieces of sugar cane. Finally, he ate 18 more pieces, so the total number of pieces he ate in the end is:  54 + 18 = 72 pieces of sugar cane. Therefore, Bobby makan 72 keping gula-gula.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 21 pieces of candy (gula-gula). Then he ate 5 pieces. So, he left with 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy. Later, he ate another 9 pieces. Therefore, he now has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy (gula-gula). Then he ate some candies and left with 8 remaining pieces. We want to know how many pieces he ate initially. So, we can say that after eating some candies, Bobby had x number of pieces of candy. Since he ate 5 more pieces later, the total number of pieces he ate is x + 5. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the given condition. Let's use substitution method. Given: Number of pieces of candy at first = 22 x = Number of pieces of candy after eating some = 8 Substitution: After eating some, Bobby had x pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy he ate is x + 5. Solving for x, we get: x + 5 = 22 - 8 x = 14 Therefore, Bobby ate 14 pieces of candy initially.
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 19 pieces of candy and then he ate 2 more, that means he has left 17 pieces of candy remaining. So, the number of pieces of candy that Bobby still has is 17.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have less than 32 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces he ate, but we can assume it's a finite number since he didn't eat all 32 pieces. So let's call that number x. Then we know that Bobby has x pieces of candy left after he finishes eating. Now, we are asked how many pieces of candy Bobby ate if there were originally 20 pieces left. So, if Bobby had x pieces of candy left after eating, then he must have eaten at least 20 - x pieces of candy initially. Therefore, the answer is x = 14.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 17 pieces of candy ( initial amount). Then he ate 15 more pieces ( additional amount). So, the total number of candies that Bobby has now is: Initial amount + Additional amount = 17 + 15 = 32 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are still 32 pieces of candy left with Bobby.
"Response:  If Bobby has 23 keping gula-gula and he initially had 30 keping gula-gula, then we can find out how many keping gula-gula are left by subtracting the number of gula-gula that Bobby has from the initial amount:

Number of gula-gula remaining = Initial amount - Number of gula-gula owned by Bobby
= 30 - 23
= 7

So there are 7 keping gula-gula left."
Response:  Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. So far, we have 5 + 3 = 8 balloons in total. Therefore, the number of balloons that Allan has is equal to the number of balloons that Jake has, which is 8.
Response:  Allan has 2 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. So, in total, they have 5 balloons (2 + 3). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Allan brings 2 bunches of bananas to the park and Jake brings x bunches of bananas, then the total number of bananas brought to the park is 2 + x. Since Jake does not bring any bananas, the only possible value for x is 0. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 bunches of bananas.
Response:  If Jake brings 6 balls to the park and he has more than Allan who brought 4 balls, then we can say that Jake brought x balls more than Allan. So, the difference between the number of balls brought by Jake and Allan is equal to x. Therefore, the number of balls brought by Allan is 4 - x. Now, we are given that Jake brought 6 balls to the park, so we can write an equation as follows: 6 = 4 - x. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Allan brought 4 balls less than Jake to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then we can say that Jake brought x balls to the park. Since Allan brought 5 balls initially, so total number of balls brought by both is 5 + x = 10. Therefore, Jake brought 4 balls (x - 5) to the park.
Response:  At first, Allan brought 3 balls to the park and Jake brought 5 balls to the park. So, in total, they had 8 balls (3 + 5). Then, Allan bought 2 more balls at the park. Therefore, the final number of balls that Allan and Jake have in the park is 10 (8 + 2).
Response:  At first, Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. So, in total, they had 6 balloons (2 + 4 = 6). Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park. Therefore, now Allan has 9 balloons (6 + 3 = 9), while Jake still has 4 balloons.  So, the number of balloons that Allan has is 9, and the number of balloons that Jake has is 4.
Response:  At first, Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. So, the total number of balloons they had together was 2 + 6 = 8. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons in the park. Therefore, the updated number of balloons that Jake had compared to Allan at the park was 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 4 balls. So far, they have 9 balls (5 + 4). Then, Allan bought 3 more balls at the park. Now, they have 12 balls in total (9 + 3). Therefore, Allan brought 12 balls to the park.
Response:  At first, Allan has 6 balloons and Jake has 2 balloons, so the total number of balloons they have is:  Allan = 6 + Jake = 2 = 8 balloons. Then, Jake buys 3 more balloons in the park, so the updated number of balloons he has is: Jake = 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Now, we need to find out how many balloons Allan has compared to Jake in the park. To do this, we divide the number of balloons Allan has (8) by the number of balloons Jake has (5):  Number of balloons Allan has compared to Jake = 8 / 5 = 1.6. So, Allan has approximately 1.6 times as many balloons as Jake in the park.
Response:  Allan has 6 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons initially. Then, Jake buys 4 more balloons in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Jake has is:  Initially = 3 + (4) = 7 Balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons that Jake has and Allan has is:  Difference = 7 - 6 = 1 balloon.
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 5 balls to the park and then Jake brought 6 balls to the park. So far, they have 11 balls in total (5 + 6 = 11). Then, Jake bought 3 more balls at the park, so now he has 9 balls (6 + 3 = 9) and the total number of balls in the park is 20 (11 + 9 = 20). Therefore, Jake brought 9 balls to the park.
Response:  Allan has 3 balls and 20 balls in total, so he has 20 + 3 = 23 balls at the park. Similarly, Jake has 5 balls and 59 balls in total, so he has 59 - 5 = 54 balls at the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Allan and Jake have at the park is 23 + 54 = 77 balls.
"Response: 
Allen has 7 balls and brings them to the park with him. So he already has 7 balls at the park.  Then, Jake also goes to the park with 6 balls in his bag. Now, there are total of 13 balls (7 + 6) at the park.  Finally, Allen and Jake have 5 balls each left after they arrive at the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Allen and Jake have at the park is 5 x 2 = 10 balls."
Response:  If Allan brings 5 balls to the park and he and Jake bring 6 balls together to the park, then the total number of balls brought to the park is 5 + 6 = 11 balls. Therefore, Jake brings 11 balls to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 2 bunches of bananas to the park and then bought 3 more bunches there, that means he had a total of 5 bunches (2 + 3 = 5) in the park.  Now, if Jake brought 6 bunches to the same park, we can say that for every bunch that Allan had, Jake had 1.5 times as many bunches (6 / 5 = 1.2). So, Jake had 7 bunches at the park (6 x 1.2 = 7).
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, if Ryan spends 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week studying English and 2 x 24 = 48 hours per week studying Chinese, then he spends 144 - 48 = 96 hours more per week studying English than Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends approximately 96/7 = 13.71 hours more per week studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning English from the number of hours he spends learning Chinese. So, in this case, Ryan spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more per day learning Chinese than English. Therefore, the ratio of the time Ryan spends learning Chinese to the time he spends learning English is 1:1.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he spends 4 hours per day learning both languages combined, we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 4 (1) Now, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends learning Chinese in total. To do this, we can substitute Equation (1) into the equation above: 3 + x = 4 (2) Solving for x, we get: x = 1 (3) Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends more than 2 hours learning English than Chinese per day, then he must spend at least 2 hours learning English and some number of hours less than 2 hours learning Chinese.  Therefore, we can write an inequality as follows:  2h + x < 7h where h is the number of hours Ryan spends learning both languages combined (English and Chinese).  Now we need to find out what value of x satisfies this inequality.  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and some number of hours less than 2 hours studying Chinese, so the total time he spends studying both languages is:  7h + x = 9h.  Subtracting 7h from both sides gives us:  x = 2.  So, Ryan spends 2 hours studying Chinese and 5 hours studying English.
Response:  If Ryan spends more than 2 hours learning English than Chinese per day, then he must spend at least 2 hours learning English for every hour he spends learning Chinese. So if he spends x hours learning Chinese, he must spend at least 2x hours learning English. Therefore, we can write an inequality as follows: 2x > 2h where x is the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese and h is the number of hours he spends learning English. Solving this inequality gives us x > h/2 which means that Ryan spends more time learning English than he does learning Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese for 5 days, then he will spend a total of:

English: 6 x 5 = 30 hours
Chinese: 7 x 5 = 35 hours
Total: 30 + 35 = 65 hours
Therefore, if Ryan learns both languages every day for 5 days, he will spend a total of 65 hours doing so."
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day studying languages.  If he studies for 2 days, then he will spend a total of 11 x 2 = 22 hours studying languages over those 2 days. So, Ryan spends 22 hours studying languages if he learns both English and Chinese for 2 consecutive days.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 9 hours (5 + 4) per day studying languages.  If he studies for 6 days in a row, he will spend a total of 54 hours (9 x 6) studying languages.
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of:  Time spent learning English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 328 hours Time spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours In total, Ryan has spent 832 hours (328 + 504) learning both languages during those 86 days.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 7 hours per day learning Chinese, and 3 hours per day learning Spanish. So in total, he spends 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day studying languages. Therefore, he spends 16/24 = 0.667 (or approximately 66.7%) of his time studying languages.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, which means he spends 12 x 6 = 72 hours per week studying English. He also spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese and 58 hours per week studying Spanish. So, in total, Ryan spends 72 + 3 + 58 = 133 hours per week studying languages. Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, which means he spends 14 hours (7 x 2) studying Chinese and 28 hours (7 x 4) studying Spanish. So, Ryan spends more time studying Spanish than Chinese. Therefore, the ratio of time spent studying English to time spent studying Chinese is 14 : 28 = 3 : 6 or 1/2.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, which means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) learning English in one week. He also spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and 4 hours per day learning Spanish, so he spends 20 hours (5 x 4) learning Chinese and Spanish combined in one week. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends 6 hours (3 x 2) learning Chinese every other day. Therefore, Ryan spends 6/7 of his time learning Chinese.
Response:  For English, he spent 4 hours per day for 7 days = 28 hours (since there are 7 days).  For Chinese, he spent 5 hours per day for 7 days = 35 hours (since there are 7 days). So in total, Ryan spent 63 hours learning both languages (28 + 35) during those 7 days.
Response:  On day 1 (Isnin), Tiffany collected $8 in coins. The next day, she found $7 more coins with a total value of $15. So, the number of coins Tiffany had on day 2 is:  $8 + $7 = $15 / $0.10 = 150 coins. Therefore, there are 150 coins that Tiffany brought from day 1 compared to the ones she found on day 2.
Response:  On day Isnin, Tiffany collected 7 beg worth of tin. Then, on the next day, she met 12 more beg that were worth tin. So, in total, Tiffany collected 7 + 12 = 19 beg worth of tin on the second day.
Response:  On day 1 (Isnin), Tiffany had 4 tins of money. If she met more beggars on the next day and got 6 tins of money from them, then the total number of tins she has now is:  Total number of tins = Number of tins on Day 1 + Number of tins gained from Beggars on Day 2  Total number of tins = 4 + x  Where x is the number of tins gained from Beggars on Day 2  Therefore, the answer to the question is 6.
Response:  On day Isnin, Tiffany collected $10 in coins. The next day, she found $4 more coins. Therefore, the total amount of money Tiffany had on day Isnin is: $10 + $4 = $14. So, Tiffany had 14 coins on day Isnin.
Response:  On day 1 (Isnin), Tiffany had 10 tins of money. Then she met 3 more tins on the next day and 7 more tins on the day after that. So, in total, Tiffany has 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 tins of money now.
Response:  On day 1 (Isnin), Tiffany collected 8 beg tins.  On day 2, she met 10 more beg tins, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 beg tins in total.  On day 3, she met 4 more beg tins, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 beg tins in total. Therefore, Tiffany collected a total of 22 beg tins after day 3.
Response:  On day 1 (Isnin), Tiffany had 3 beg tins. So far so good! Then she met 7 more beggars on the next day and gave them each 1 beg tin. That means she now has 3 + 7 = 10 beg tins in total. But wait, there's more! The following day, she encountered 44 more people who needed help, and she gave each of them 1 beg tin as well. Therefore, the final number of beg tins that Tiffany has is 10 + 44 = 54 beg tins!
Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples there are than green apples, we can use subtraction. So, the difference between the number of red apples and green apples is: 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there are one more red apple than green apple in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can use subtraction. So, the difference between the number of green apples and the number of red apples is: 11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are 15 apples in total, then the number of green apples must be less than or equal to 5 (since we already have 10 red apples). Therefore, there are exactly 5 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red apples and some green apples in the basket. If there are more than 10 more green apples than red apples in the basket, then we can say that the number of green apples is greater than or equal to 13 (3 + x), where x is the difference between the number of red apples and the number of green apples. So, the number of green apples in the basket is greater than or equal to 13.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples, 15 yellow apples, and 8 green apples in the basket. So, we can write this information as follows: 7 + 15 + 8 = x (where x is the total number of apples). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use the equation above and substitute the values given in the problem: 7 + 15 + 8 = x Substituting the values given in the problem: 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red persimmons (persik merah), 71 yellow persimmons (persik Kuning), and 8 green persimmons (persik Hijau) in the basket. To find out how many more green persimmons than red persimmons there are, we can use the following equation: Number of green persimmons = Total number of persimmons - Number of red persimmons So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of green persimmons = 8 + 71 - 7 = 62 Therefore, there are 62 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 14 more persimmons than oranges in the basket. So, if there are 6 orange persimmons, then there are 14 + 6 = 20 green persimmons in the basket. Therefore, there are 20 more green persimmons than yellow persimmons in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red persimmons, 11 yellow persimmons, and 12 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more red persimmons than yellow persimmons, we need to subtract the number of yellow persimmons from the total number of persimmons. So, the answer is: 19 - 11 = 8 more red persimmons than yellow persimmons.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. So, if we want to find out how many red apples and green apples are in the basket, we can use the following formulae: Number of red apples = 6 Number of green apples = 16 Now, let's convert these numbers into fractions or decimals. To do this, we need to divide each number by the total number of apples (i.e., 90). Number of red apples as fraction = 6/90 = 0.067 Number of green apples as fraction = 16/90 = 0.178 Now, we can express our answers in decimal format by rounding off these fractions to two decimal places. Therefore, the number of red apples in the basket is approximately 0.07, and the number of green apples is approximately 0.18.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket. So, we have a total of: 18 + 14 = 32 apples in the basket. Therefore, there are 32 apples in the basket, including both red and yellow ones.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket. Since we also have 6 green apples, let's assume they are distributed equally among the other two colors. So, the number of yellow apples is 14 / 2 = 7. Therefore, there are 5 red apples, 7 yellow apples, and 6 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 65 bakuls of persimmon in total.  Each bakul contains 7 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of red persimmons = 7 x 65 = 455 red persimmons Total number of green persimmons = 3 x 65 = 195 green persimmons In summary, there are 455 + 195 = 650 buah persik (persimmons) altogether.
Response:  We know that there are 11 bakuls of persimmon fruits in total. Each bakul contains 10 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of red persimmons = 10 x 11 = 110  Total number of green persimmons = 18 x 11 = 208  Therefore, the total number of persimmons (red + green) in all 11 bakuls is equal to 328.
Response:  We know that there are 6 bakuls of persimmon fruits in total. Each bakul contains 16 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of red persimmons = Number of bakuls x Number of red persimmons per bakulTotal number of green persimmons = Number of bakuls x Number of green persimmons per bakulNow, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations:Total number of red persimmons = 6 x 16 = 96Total number of green persimmons = 6 x 18 = 108Therefore, there are 96 red persimmons and 108 green persimmons in the total of 6 bakuls of persimmon fruits.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 bakuls of persimmon fruits. Each bakul contains 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So, in total, we have:
Red persimmons = 7 x 10 = 70
Green persimmons = 7 x 2 = 14
Therefore, there are 14 green persimmons in the 7 bakuls of persimmons."
Response:  If there are 7 persimmons in total, and each basket has 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons, then we can calculate the number of baskets as follows: Number of baskets = Total number of persimmons / Number of persimmons per basket  Number of baskets = 7 / (4 + 3)  Number of baskets = 7 / 7  Number of baskets = 1 So, there is one basket with 7 persimmons in total.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fruits in total, and each basket contains 4 red apples and some green apples. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of fruits = Number of red apples + Number of green apples 12 = 4x + y (where x is the number of green apples) Now, we want to find out how many green apples are in each basket. To do this, we divide the total number of green apples by the number of baskets: Number of green apples per basket = Total number of green apples / Number of baskets  Number of green apples per basket = 12 / 3 = 4 Therefore, there are 4 green apples in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 16 persimmons in total and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green persimmons is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in the basket.
Response:  We know that each bakul contains 19 red persimmons and 4 green persimmons. So, if there are 15 bakuls in total, then we can calculate the number of red persimmons as follows: Number of red persimmons = Total number of bakuls x Number of red persimmons per bakul Number of red persimmons = 15 x 19 = 285 red persimmons Similarly, we can calculate the number of green persimmons as follows: Number of green persimmons = Total number of bakuls x Number of green persimmons per bakul Number of green persimmons = 15 x 4 = 60 green persimmons Therefore, there are 285 red persimmons and 60 green persimmons in total.
Response:  We know that there are 10 baskets of persimmons in total. Each basket has an equal number of red and green persimmons. So, if each basket has 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons, then the total number of red persimmons is 4 x 10 = 40, and the total number of green persimmons is 6 x 10 = 60. Therefore, there are 40 + 60 = 100 baskets of persimmons in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green apples, 60 yellow apples, and 2 red apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can use the following equation: Number of green apples - Number of red apples = Difference between number of green and red apples In this case, the difference between the number of green and red apples is: 6 (green) - 2 (red) = 4 Therefore, there are 4 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures in his collection. Then he added some more action figures to the collection. If there are currently 8 action figures in his collection, then the number of action figures that Jerry added is equal to 8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, Jerry added 4 action figures to his collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures in his room. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. How many action figures did Jerry have initially in his room if there are now 10 action figures total on the shelf?  To find out, we can divide the number of action figures on the shelf (10) by the number of action figures Jerry had at first (let's call it x). So, x = 10 / 7 = 1 and 4. Therefore, Jerry had 5 action figures initially in his room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his shelf. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures is now: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures. Therefore, there are 10 action figures in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry has 5 action figures and 9 books in his shelf initially. Then he adds 7 more action figures, so the total number of action figures is now 12 (5 + 7). Now we need to find out how many action figures are there in addition to the ones already present in the shelf. Therefore, the total number of action figures = 12 (newly added) + 5 (initial amount) = 17 action figures. So, there are 17 action figures in addition to the ones already present in Jerry's shelf after he adds 7 more action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books in his shelf. Then he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures is now 6 (2 + 4). The total number of books remains unchanged at 10. Therefore, there are 6 action figures and 10 books in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books in his shelf initially. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items in Jerry's shelf is: 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 items. Therefore, there are 27 books in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his shelf initially. Then he added 4 more books. So, the total number of items on his shelf is: 7 + 2 = 9. Since there are 9 items on his shelf, the number of action figures is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his shelf. Then he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items in Jerry's shelf is now:  Action Figures = 5 + 9 = 14 Books = 2 + 9 = 11 Therefore, there are 14 action figures and 11 books in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room. Then he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, the total number of action figures that Jerry has now is: 8 + 4 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures in his shelf. Then he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones. So, the total number of action figures that Jerry took from the shelf is equal to the original number minus the number he removed. In this case, the original number was 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, Jerry took 7 action figures from the shelf.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his shelf. Then he added some more actions to the shelf and removed 10 old ones. So, the total number of action figures in Jerry's shelf now is: 7 + (some numbers) - 10 =?  We are not given any information about the ""some numbers"" that Jerry added to his shelf, so we cannot determine the exact number of action figures there now. However, based on the information provided, we know that the total number of action figures in Jerry's shelf after adding new ones and removing old ones is greater than 7 but less than or equal to 17 (since 10 old action figures were removed). Therefore, the answer is between 7 and 17, inclusive."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures in his shelf. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. So, the total number of action figures that Jerry had at first is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, Jerry initially had 5 action figures in his shelf.
Response:  If Jerry has 9 action figures in his room and then adds 7 more action characters, he now has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total.  If he also has 10 books in his room, that means he has 16 action figures plus 10 books = 26 items in total.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his shelf initially. When he added 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures became 6. So, the number of action figures after adding 2 new ones is 6 + 2 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 action figures in Jerry's shelf now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his shelf. Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, now Jerry has 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Since there are twice as many action figures as books (3 vs 7), we can say that for every action figure, there are approximately 2 books. Therefore, the number of books is 10 x 2 = 20 books.  So, the answer is 20 books.
Response:  We have 2 birds already sitting on the fence (Dua). Then, more birds come to join them (beberapa). So, in total, we have 2 + however many new birds came = number of birds sitting on the fence now. Therefore, the answer is 2 + x, where x is the number of new birds that came.
Response:  At first, there were 4 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have 8 birds (4 + 4) sitting on the fence initially. Therefore, the answer is 8.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 birds perched on the fence and 46 birds in total. So, if we add 6 more birds who joined them, then the total number of birds on the fence is:  
$ Number = 4 \times 46 + 6 $  $= 180 + 6 $  $= 186 $ Therefore, there are 186 birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 3 birds and 2 crows already sitting on the fence. If we add 5 more birds, then there are in total 8 birds (3 + 2 + 5). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We have 3 birds (gagak) already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds come to join them, making it 5 birds in total. So, there are 5 birds more than the original 3 birds who were sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We have 2 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds come to join them, making it a total of 5 birds (including the original 2). So, there are 5 birds in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4 storks already sitting on the fence. Then, we are told that 2 more eagles join them. So, in total, there are now 6 birds (the original 4 storks + the 2 new eagles). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 crows sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence. Then, another 6 birds join them. Therefore, the final number of birds sitting on the fence is 7 + 6 = 13 birds.
Response:  We have 6 birds (burung) sitting on the fence. Then, we have 3 crows (gagak) also sitting on the fence with them. So, in total, we have 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more than 9 birds sitting on the fence compared to the number of crows (gagak).
Response:  We know that there are 4 birds perched on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds join them, making it 7 birds in total. Finally, 6 additional birds arrive, bringing the total number of birds to 13 (7 + 6). Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  We have 6 birds already sitting on the fence. Then, we have 4 more birds coming to join them. So, in total, we have 10 birds (6 + 4) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 5 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, we have 4 more crows joining them, making it a total of 9 birds (5 initial + 4 new). So, there are more than 4 crows than sparrows if we compare the number of crows to the number of sparrows. Therefore, the correct answer is 9 - 4 = 5.
Response:  We have 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, we have 2 more birds joining them, making it 5 birds in total. Next, another 6 birds come to join, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (5 + 6). Therefore, there are 11 birds in total - 3 birds that were originally sitting on the fence and 8 new birds that joined later.
Response:  We have 5 birds perched on a fence (gagak). Then, we have 3 more birds sitting on the same fence (duduk). So far, we have 8 birds in total. Next, another 4 birds arrive to join them, bringing the total number of birds to 12. Therefore, there are more than 5 times as many birds as gagaks sitting on the fence. The correct answer is 12 / 5 = 2.
Response:  We have 6 birds perched on a fence and 2 birds sitting on it. Then, 3 more birds arrive to join them. So, in total, we have 6 + 2 = 8 birds. Therefore, there are 8 birds of gaggles (groups) of birds.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence and 6 birds flying overhead. So, the total number of birds is 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 birds in total - 3 birds sitting on the fence and 6 birds flying overhead.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages long and the second chapter has 11 pages long. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, there are 37 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
"Response:  We know that Bab Pertama has 37 pages and Bab Kedua has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in Bab Kedua than in Bab Pertama, we can subtract the number of pages in Bab Pertama from the number of pages in Bab Kedua:

Pages in Bab Kedua - Pages in Bab Pertama = 80 - 37 = 43

So, there are 43 more pages in Bab Kedua than in Bab Pertama."
Response:  We know that there are 60 pages in the first chapter and 93 pages in total in the book. So, if we divide the number of pages in the second chapter (93) by the number of pages in the first chapter (60), we get: $ \frac {93} {60} = 1.55$ pages. Therefore, there are approximately 155 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and Chapter 2 has 36 pages long. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, there are 31 pages in Chapter 1 of the book.
Response:  We know that there are three parts to this book: Bab 1 (66 pages), Bab 2 (35 pages), and Bab 3 (24 pages). So, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages Therefore, the answer is 125 pages.
"Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages long, and the second chapter has 23 pages long. So, we need to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter. To do this, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:

Number of pages in first chapter - Number of pages in second chapter = 91 - 23 = 68
Therefore, there are 68 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter."
Response:  We know that there are three chapters (bab) in this book. Chapter one is 35 pages long, chapter two is 18 pages long, and chapter three is 3 pages long. To find out how many more pages chapter two has than chapter three, we can subtract the number of pages in chapter three from the number of pages in chapter two: 18 - 3 = 15 So, chapter two has 15 more pages than chapter three.
Response:  We know that bab pertama has 53 pages and bab ketiga has 21 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in bab kedua as follows:  Number of pages in bab kedua = 53 + (75 - 21) = 53 + 54 = 107 pages  Therefore, there are more than 107 pages in bab pertama compared to bab ketiga.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages long. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Length of Each Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages So, the total number of pages in the book is 1931 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 10 pages long. So, the total number of pages in the first chapter is 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters (bab) in the book with a total of 81 pages (halaman). Since we want to find out how many pages are in Chapter 2, we can start by identifying the number of pages in each chapter:
Chapter 1 has 30 pages (3 x 10 = 30), and
Chapter 2 has 68 pages (68 halaman). Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
Answer: 30 + 68 = 98 pages."
Response:  At dawn (pagi), there are 62 people kayaking. Then, 39 of them go fishing at dusk (petang). So, how many people were kayaking at dusk compared to dawn? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of people who went fishing from the total number of people kayaking at dawn: 62 - 39 = 23 Therefore, there were 23 more people kayaking at dawn than at dusk.
Response:  At dawn (pagi), there are 52 people kayaking.  At dusk (petang), there are 61 people going for a sunset cruise. To find out how many more people went for the sunset cruise compared to those who went kayaking at dawn, we need to subtract the number of people who went kayaking from the number of people who went for the sunset cruise: 61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 more people who went for the sunset cruise compared to those who went kayaking at dawn.
Response:  We know that 15 people went kayaking in the morning and some more arrived later in the day. So, let's assume that x is the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon (including those who arrived after 3 pm).  Since there are 32 total people going kayaking, we can write an equation based on this information:  Number of people who went kayaking in the morning + Number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon = Total number of people going kayaking 15 + x = 32 Now, we want to find out how many people went kayaking in the afternoon. To do this, we need to divide the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon (x) by the total number of people going kayaking (32): x / 32 = 15 / 32 x = 8 Therefore, there were 8 people who went kayaking in the afternoon.
Response:  If there are 7 kayaks sailing in the evening and 60 people sailing during the day, then we can calculate the number of people who sailed during the day as follows:  Number of people sailing during the day = Total number of people sailing x Percentage of people sailing during the day / 100  In this case, the percentage of people sailing during the day is 60/7 = 85.71% (rounded to two decimal places) So, if there were 70 people sailing during the day, we would have:  Number of people sailing during the day = 70 85.71% = 59.29 people Therefore, there were approximately 59 people sailing during the day that particular morning.
Response:  We know that there are 36 boats sailing in the morning and 49 boats sailing at night. So, we have to find out how many people are sailing altogether. To do this, we need to multiply the number of boats sailing during each time period by the number of people per boat. For example, if there are 36 boats sailing in the morning and each boat has an average of 5 people (which is just an estimate), then the total number of people sailing in the morning would be: 36 x 5 = 180 people. Similarly, if there are 49 boats sailing at night and each boat has an average of 4 people (again, just an estimate), then the total number of people sailing at night would be: 49 x 4 = 196 people. Therefore, the total number of people who are sailing in the area is: 180 + 196 = 376 people.
"Response:  We know that there are 44 people who go to work in the morning and 39 people who go to work in the evening. So, we have:
Morning = 44 x 1 = 44 people
Evening = 39 x 1 = 39 people
Now, let's find out how many more people go to work in the evening than in the morning:
More people in evening = Number of people in evening - Number of people in morning = 39 - 44 = -5
So, there are 5 fewer people who go to work in the evening than in the morning."
"Response:  We know that there are 53 people who went for a swim in the morning and 48 people who went for a swim in the evening. So, we have:

Morning: 53 x = 100 (since 53 is less than 100)
Evening: 48 x = 96 (since 48 is less than 96)
Now, let's find out how many more people went for a swim in the evening compared to the morning:

More people went for a swim in the evening: 96 - 100 = -4
So, there were 4 fewer people who went for a swim in the evening compared to the morning."
Response:  If there are 34 people who go to the beach during the evening (waktu petang), and 10 people who go to the beach during the night (waktu malam), then we can calculate the ratio of people who go to the beach during the night compared to those who go during the evening as follows:  Number of people who go to the beach at night / Number of people who go to the beach during the evening = 10/34 = 0.29  So, approximately 29% of the total number of people who go to the beach do so during the night.
Response:  We know that there are 13 people who went kayaking in the morning and 59 people who went hiking in the morning. Therefore, the total number of people who went to the mountain in the morning is 13 + 59 = 72 people. Now let's move on to the evening. We know that 21 people went kayaking in the evening. So, the total number of people who went to the mountain in the evening is 72 (morning) + 21 (evening) = 93 people. Therefore, the answer is 93 people.
Response:  We know that there are 29 people who went kayaking in the morning and 66 people who went hiking in the morning. Then, we also know that 26 people went kayaking in the evening. So, how many more people went kayaking in the evening compared to those who went in the morning? To find out, let's divide the number of people who went kayaking in the evening (26) by the number of people who went kayaking in the morning (29):  Number of people who went kayaking in the evening / Number of people who went kayaking in the morning = 26/29 = 0.89 or approximately 9 people more went kayaking in the evening than in the morning. Now, let's compare this with the number of people who went hiking in the morning and evening. We know that 66 people went hiking in the morning and 26 people went hiking in the evening. So, how many more people went hiking in the evening compared to those who went in the morning? To find out, let's divide the number of people who went hiking in the evening (26) by the number of people who went hiking in the morning (66): Number of people who went hiking in the evening / Number of people who went hiking in the morning = 26/66 = 0.38 or approximately 4 people more went hiking in the evening than in the morning. Therefore, based on these calculations, it can be concluded that approximately 9 more people went kayaking in the evening than in the morning, while approximately 4 more people went hiking in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  Orang-orang yang pergi mendayung = 41 (as given in the question) + 4 (as given in the question) = 45 people went for kayaking and hiking.  People who went for kayaking only = 26 (as given in the question) = 26 people went for kayaking. Therefore, the number of people who went for both kayaking and hiking is: 45 - 26 = 19 people.
Response:  We know that there are 46 people in total who went for a swim.  During the morning (pagi), 43 people went for a swim. So, we have 43 - 43 = 0 people who went for a swim during the afternoon (petang). Therefore, the number of people who went for a swim during the evening is 0.
Response:  If there were initially 7 epal on the tree and Rachel took 4 of them, then the number of epal left on the tree is:  7 - 4 = 3 So, there are still 3 epal remaining on the tree after Rachel took 4 of them.
Response:  At first, Pokok Rachel has 4 epal (epal). Then, Rachel takes some of them and now there are only 2 epal left on the tree. So, we can say that Rachel took 2 epal from the original 4 epal. Therefore, the number of epal that Rachel took is 2.
Response:  Rachel took 7 ripe mangoes from her tree. Now there are still 5 ripe mangoes left on the tree. If 3 of them have already been picked and the rest haven't been picked yet, how many unpicked mangoes are left on the tree now?  Therefore, the answer is 5 (unpicked mangoes).
Response:  If Rachel takes 2 ripe mangoes from her tree and there are still 7 unripe mangoes left on the tree, then the number of ripe mangoes on the tree is 7 - 2 = 5. So, there are 5 ripe mangoes left on the tree after Rachel takes 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel took 6 immature durians from her tree. Now, the tree has 2 immature and 4 unripe ones. So, the total number of immature durians on the tree is 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that Rachel took 3 ripe mangosteens from her tree. Now, the tree has 2 ripe mangosteens and 27 unripe ones. To find out how many ripe mangosteens the tree needs to produce, we can use the following equation: Number of ripe mangosteens = Total number of mangosteens - Number of ripe mangosteens already present So, in this case, the total number of mangosteens is 2 + 27 = 30. Therefore, the tree needs to produce 30 - 2 = 28 more ripe mangosteens.
Response:  Rachel took 7 apples from her tree. After that, two new apples grew on the same tree. Now there are still 6 apples above the ground. So, the total number of apples that the tree produced is 6 + 2 = 8 apples.
Response:  Pokok Rachel has 2 apples initially. Then, she takes 4 apples from the tree. After that, 3 new apples grow on the tree. So, how many apples are there in the tree now?  We can use the following equation to calculate the number of apples: Number of apples = Initial apples + Apples taken - New apples grown Initial apples = 2 (from the question) Apples taken = 4 (from the question) New apples grown = 3 (from the question) Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: Number of apples = 2 + 4 - 3 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 apples in Pokok Rachel's tree now.
Response:  If Rachel has 52 peppers and takes 2 from one of them, she will have 52 - 2 = 50 peppers left. Now, there are still 7 peppers above the remaining plant. So, the total number of peppers that the plant produced is 7 + 50 = 57 peppers.
Response:  We know that Rachel has taken 8 epal from each of her three gardens, so she has taken in total 8 x 3 = 24 epal. Now, we are told that after taking these epal, the number of epal left on each garden is still above them. So, the total number of epal left on all the gardens before Rachel took any was 9 - 24 = -15 epl. Therefore, there were initially -15 epal in all the gardens combined.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 4 pepper plants and she takes 7 peppers from each plant. So, in total, she takes 4 x 7 = 28 peppers. But now we are told that there are still 29 peppers left above the plants. Therefore, the number of peppers Rachel took is equal to the number of peppers left above the plants, which is 29 - 28 = 1. So, Rachel took 1 pepper.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 2 marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had 2x marbles, then after playing in the park, Ed would have x + 3 marbles (since he gained 3 marbles) while Doug would have 2x - 5 marbles (since he lost 5 marbles). Now, we are told that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 3 = 19...(1)...and solve for x: x = 16...(2) Since Doug had 2x marbles initially, we can substitute this value into equation (2): 2x = 16...(3) Solving for x, we get: x = 8...(4) So, Doug originally had 8 marbles, and Ed had 10 marbles (8 + 3). Therefore, Ed gained 3 marbles during their playtime at the park.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 10 marbles than Doug because he has 45 marbles and Doug only has 31 marbles. So, we can say that Ed has x marbles more than Doug. Now, we are told that Doug lost 11 marbles in the park. This means that Doug now has 31 - 11 = 20 marbles left. Therefore, Ed still has x marbles more than Doug after Doug lost his marbles. Since Ed had 45 marbles initially, we can set up the equation: x + 20 = 45. Solving for x, we get: x = 25. So, Ed has 25 marbles more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 6 marbles than Doug because he has 22 marbles and Doug lost 7 balls in the game. So, we can say that Ed has at least 15 marbles (22 - 7 = 15). Therefore, Doug now has 9 marbles (6 + 3 = 9).
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 5 marbles than Doug initially because he has 27 marbles and needs to lose 3 for the game. So, we can start with Ed having x marbles at first. Then, since Doug lost 3 marbles, his initial number of marbles is less than or equal to x - 3. Now, we are given that Ed has 5 more marbles than Doug, so Ed's final number of marbles (x + 5) must be greater than Doug's initial number of marbles (x - 3). Solving for x, we get: x = 20. Therefore, Ed had 20 marbles initially, and Doug had fewer than 20 marbles initially.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 24 marbles and Doug has less than 24 marbles. When they played in the park, Doug lost 27 marbles while Ed gained 9 marbles. So, if we subtract the number of marbles Doug lost from the number of marbles he had (which is less than 24), we can find out how many marbles Ed got. Therefore, the answer is:  Ed has 24 - 27 = 3 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 29 marbles than Doug because he has 36 marbles in total (29 + 7). However, we also know that Ed lost 17 marbles playing outside. So, how many marbles does Ed have left after losing them?  Well, if Ed had 36 marbles and lost 17 of them, then he has 19 marbles left (36 - 17 = 19). Therefore, the number of marbles Ed has is 19, which is less than the number of marbles Doug has.
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 19 marbles than Doug initially. So, if Ed loses some marbles in the game, he will have fewer marbles than before.  Since now Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, we can deduce that Ed had 27 (19 + 8) marbles initially and lost x marbles in the game. Therefore, Ed lost 27 - x marbles.
"Response:  We know that Ed has more than 30 marbles than Doug because he has 91 marbles and Doug only has 61 marbles. So, we can say that Ed has x marbles more than Doug. Now, we are told that Ed lost 21 marbles in the park game. Therefore, the number of marbles Ed had after losing them is:
x - 21 = 70
So, Ed has 70 marbles more than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 12 marbles because he has 17 in total. If Ed lost 20 marbles from his collection of 17, then how many does he have left? So, Doug now has 17 - 20 = 7 marbles.
Response:  If 408 students suggest adding mung bean paste to the menu and 42 students suggest adding meat, then we can calculate the ratio of students who suggested mung bean paste to those who suggested meat as follows:  Ratio = Number of students suggesting mung bean paste / Total number of students = 408 / (408 + 42) = 10.35 So, approximately 10.35 times more students suggested mung bean paste than suggested meat.
"Response:  If 479 students suggest adding mung bean soup to the menu and 489 students suggest adding beef to the menu, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding protein = 479 + 489 = 968

So, out of every 100 students, 96 (968/100) students suggested adding beef to the menu."
Response:  If 310 students were asked to suggest a type of food for lunch and 185 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu, then we can say that 185/310 = 0.59 (or approximately 60%) of the students suggested adding potatoes. Now, if we want to know how many students suggested adding meat, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested adding potatoes from the total number of students. So, 310 - 185 = 125 students did not suggest adding potatoes, which means they must have suggested something else. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding meat is 125 / 310 = 0.41 (or approximately 41%) of the students.
Response:  If 288 students were asked to suggest a type of food for lunch and 264 students suggested adding bacon, then there are 288 - 264 = 124 students who did not suggest adding bacon. Of these, 124 / 2 = 62 students suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, there are 62 students who suggested adding potatoes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students suggested adding potatoes and chicken in their meals. According to the question, 457 students suggested adding potatoes while 290 students suggested adding chicken. So, the total number of students who suggested adding these two ingredients is 457 + 290 = 747.  Next, we need to find out what percentage of students suggested adding each ingredient. To do this, we can divide the number of students who suggested adding each ingredient by the total number of students (i.e., 747). For potatoes, the percentage is 457/747 x 100% = 61%. For chicken, the percentage is 290/747 x 100% = 38%. Therefore, if there are more than 61% of students who suggested adding potatoes, then there will be more students who suggested adding chicken.
Response:  If 182 students suggest adding potatoes and 166 students suggest adding meat to the menu, then there are more students who suggest adding meat than those who suggest adding potatoes. So, the number of students who suggest adding meat is greater than the number of students who suggest adding potatoes. Therefore, the answer is (A) Many more students suggest adding meat than those who suggest adding potatoes.
Response:  If 324 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and 374 students suggest adding meat, then there are a total of 698 suggestions for new food items (324 + 374 = 698).  And if 128 students suggest adding tomatoes, then there are a total of 826 suggestions for new food items (698 + 128 = 826). Therefore, the number of students who take part in suggesting new food items is 826.
Response:  If 257 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 120 of them suggest adding beef, then there are 257 + 120 = 377 suggestions for potatoes.  If 97 students suggest adding tomatoes, then there are 97 additional suggestions beyond those who suggested beef. Therefore, the total number of suggestions for tomatoes is 97 + (377 - 120) = 97 + 257 = 454 suggestions.
Response:  If 144 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, then there are 144 x 4 = 576 students who do not suggest adding potatoes.  If 467 students suggest adding beef to the menu, then there are 467 - 144 = 323 students who do not suggest adding beef.  Finally, if 79 students suggest adding tomatoes to the menu, then there are 79 - 467 = 388 students who do not suggest adding tomatoes. Therefore, among the students who suggested adding potatoes, there are 576 / 79 = 7.4 times more students than those who did not suggest adding potatoes.
Response:  If 228 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, then there are 228 x 3 = 684 students who do not suggest adding potatoes.  If 337 students suggest adding meat to the menu, then there are 684 - 337 = 347 students who do not suggest adding meat.  Finally, if 23 students suggest adding tomatoes, then there are 347 - 23 = 324 students who do not suggest adding tomatoes. Therefore, out of the total number of students (228 + 337 + 23), 324 students do not suggest adding any of the three food items mentioned in the question.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students chose each type of food in total. From the given information, there are 66 options for food and 450 students participated in the survey. Therefore, the total number of choices made by all students is:  Total choices = Number of students x Number of options = 450 x 66 = 29,700 Now, let's find out how many students chose each option: Option A (Kentang Tumbuk) - 38 students chose this option, so the frequency of this option is: Frequency of Kentang Tumbuk = Number of students who chose it / Total number of choices = 38 / 29,700 = 0.127 or approximately 12.7% Option B (Daging) - 45 students chose this option, so the frequency of this option is: Frequency of Daging = Number of students who chose it / Total number of choices = 45 / 29,700 = 0.15 or approximately 15% Option C (Lain-lain) - The remaining 223 students did not choose any of the above options, so their frequency is: Frequency of Lain-lain = Total number of choices - (Frequency of Kentang Tumbuk + Frequency of Daging) = 29,700 - (0.127 + 0.15) = 29,700 - 0.27 = 29,430 or approximately 97.3% So, based on these frequencies, we can conclude that: * Approximately 12.7% of students chose Kentang Tumbuk as their first choice. * Approximately 15% of students chose Daging as their first choice. * Approximately 97.3% of students did not choose either of the two options as their first choice.
Response:  If 218 students suggest adding mashed potatoes and pork, then there will be 218 x 2 = 436 servings of mashed potatoes and pork added to the menu.  If 351 students suggest adding only pork, then there will be 351 x 1 = 351 servings of pork added to the menu. Therefore, in total, there will be 436 + 351 = 787 servings of meat (mashed potatoes and/or pork) added to the menu based on the suggestions of these two groups of students.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students have suggested adding daging pekat (DP) to the menu. From the question, we know that 269 students have made this suggestion. Next, we need to find out how many students have suggested adding kentang tumbuk (KT) to the menu. According to the question, 330 students have made this suggestion. Finally, we need to find out how many students have suggested adding tomato (TOM) to the menu. Based on the question, 76 students have made this suggestion. So, the total number of students who have suggested adding any of these ingredients is 269 + 330 + 76 = 675.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can divide the number of girls by the number of boys:  Number of girls / Number of boys = 569/236 = 2.41  So, for every boy in the school, there are approximately 2.41 girls.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys attending this school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, if we subtract 34 from 841, we get: 841 - 34 = 796 Therefore, there are 796 more boys than girls at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school. From this information, we can calculate the number of male students as follows: Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students Therefore, the number of male students is equal to: 485 - 232 = 253 male students So, there are 253 male students at the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are more female students than male students at this school. So, let F be the number of female students and M be the number of male students. We can write an equation based on the information given in the question as follows:  F + M = 697 (Total number of students)  Now, we want to find out how many more female students there are compared to male students. To do this, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students:  F - M =?  Substituting the values we have obtained so far into the above equation gives us:  F - M = 228  Therefore, there are 228 more female students than male students at this school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are more than 635 girls in the school (since the number of boys is less than half). So, let's assume that there are x girls in the school. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Number of boys = 635 + 510 = 1145 Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 1145.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are more female students than male students in the school. So, let F be the number of female students and M be the number of male students. We can write this as:  F > M  Secondly, we know that there are 281 more females than males in the school. This means that if F is the number of female students, then F - M = 281. Now, we want to find out how many male students there are in total. Since we know that F > M, we can write this as:  M < F - 281. Finally, we want to find out the exact number of male students in the school. To do this, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of students. So, we can write:  Male Students = Total Students - F + 281. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Male Students = 868 - (F + 281) = 868 - (569 + 281) = 307. Therefore, there are 307 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are more male students than female students in the school. So, if there are 700 total students and 142 more males than females, then the number of male students must be greater than or equal to 700 - 142 = 558. Therefore, the answer is 558.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school initially. So, the total number of students is 706 + 222 = 928. Then, we are told that 418 more girls joined the school. Therefore, the updated number of students in the school now is 928 + 418 = 1346.
Response:  We know that there are initially 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls join the school, so the total number of girls now is: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are currently 946 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 632 + 410 = 1042. Now, we want to find out how many girls are there compared to the boys. To do this, we divide the number of girls (465) by the total number of students (1042). Therefore, the ratio of girls to boys is 465/1042 = 2.57. So, for every 2.57 boys, there is one girl in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school initially. Then, we know that 682 more girls joined the school later, so the total number of girls now is 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, the number of girls currently in the school is 1414.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially. Then, we have 496 more girls joining the school, so the total number of girls is now: 135 + 496 = 631 girls. Similarly, we have 910 boys joining the school, so the total number of boys is now: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, the current number of boys in the school is 1124.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school.  If we assume that each class has an equal number of students (which may not be true), then we can estimate the total number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class  In this case, if we assume that there are 308 girls and 318 boys, and each class has 35 students (which is a rough estimate based on typical class sizes), then we get: Number of classes = 308 + 318 = 626 Number of classes = 626 / 35 = 17 Classes So, there are approximately 17 classes in the school. Now, let's find out how many teachers are needed to teach these classes. We know that there are 36 teachers in the school, and we want to find out how many classes each teacher teaches. To do this, we divide the number of teachers by the number of classes: Number of teachers per class = Number of teachers / Number of classes  In this case, if we divide 36 teachers by 17 classes, we get: Number of teachers per class = 36 / 17 = 2.11 teachers per class This means that on average, each class has about 2.11 teachers.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many total students are in the school. We can do this by adding up the number of girls and boys:  Total Students = Number of Girls + Number of Boys  Total Students = 315 + 309 = 624 Therefore, there are 624 students in the school. Next, we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. We know that there are more male than female teachers, so let's use that information to our advantage! The ratio of male to female teachers is given as ""berapa ramai orang"". This means that for every X male teachers, there are Y females teachers. In other words, if we want to find out how many male teachers there are, we can multiply the number of female teachers by the ratio of male to female teachers: Male Teachers = Female Teachers x Berapa Ramai Orang  Male Teachers = 772 (Female Teachers) x 2 = 1544 Therefore, there are 1544 teachers in the school - including both male and female teachers. So, the answer to the question is 1544."
Response:  We know that there are more females than males at this school. So, if we want to find out how many boys there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of boys is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls.  Using the information given in the question, we can calculate as follows: Total number of students = 402 + 739 = 1,141 Number of girls = 402 Hence, the number of boys is equal to 1,141 - 402 = 739
Response:  We know that there are more female students than male students at this school. So, if there are 458 more females than males, then the number of male students is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of female students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students  Now, we are given that the total number of students is 692. Substituting this value into our equation, we get: Number of male students = 692 - 458 = 234 male students.  Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 male students and 257 female students in the school initially. So, the total number of students is 362 + 257 = 619. Then, we are told that 403 more girls joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of students is 619 + 403 = 1022. Now, to find out how many females are there compared to males, we divide the number of females (403) by the number of males (362): 403 / 362 = 1.11. So, for every one male student, there are approximately 1.11 females students in the school.
"Response:  We know that Edward has $ 18 and he spends $ 16. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $ 18 - $ 16 = x  Where ""x"" represents the amount of money left with Edward after he spent $ 16. Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $ 2 (since there are two dollars in one dollar):  $ 9 = x  Therefore, Edward has $ 9 left after he spent $ 16."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 13 initially. Then he spends a little money and now he only has $ 3 left. So, the amount of money that Edward spent is equal to the difference between his initial balance ($ 13) and his current balance ($ 3), which is $ 10. Therefore, the answer is $ 10.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $ 9. Then he spent $ 8 and now has $ 17. So, initially Edward had $ 9 - $ 8 = $ 1 more than $ 9. Therefore, Edward had $ 9 before he spent his money.
Response:  If Edward spent $ 16 to buy 92 books and each book cost him the same amount of money (i.e., $ 16), then he had $ 16 / 92 = $ 0.178 before spending his money. Therefore, Edward has $ 6 - $ 0.178 = $ 5.82 left after spending his money.
Response:  If Edward spends $ 6 to buy one book that costs him the same amount of money (i.e., $ 6), then he will spend twice as much for two books, which is $ 12. Therefore, each book costs $ 6.
Response:  Firstly, Edward spent $ 6 to buy a book and $ 16 to buy a pen. So he has $ 6 + $ 16 = $ 22 left after making these purchases. Now, we are told that Edward has $ 19 dollars left after spending his money. Therefore, the amount of money Edward had before he spent any money is $ 19 - $ 22 = -$ 3.
Response:  If Edward spent $ 4 for the book and $ 3 for the pen, then he has $ 12 left after making those purchases. So, we can write an equation as follows: Book cost = $ 4 Pen cost = $ 3 Total amount spent = $ 12 Now, let's solve this system of equations to find out how much Edward spent on each item. We can do this by subtracting the cost of one item from the total amount spent: Book cost = $ 12 - $ 4 = $ 8 Pen cost = $ 12 - $ 3 = $ 9 Therefore, Edward spent $ 8 on the book and $ 9 on the pen.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $ 16 for the book and $ 8 for the pen. So he has $ 19 left after purchasing both items. To find out how much he spent on the book compared to the pen, we can divide the amount of money he had left ($ 19) by the cost of the book ($ 16): $$ \frac {19}{16} = 1.125 $$ This means that Edward spent approximately 125% more on the book than he did on the pen.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $ 17. Then he received $ 10 from his friend. Now he has $ 7 left. So, to find out how much Edward had before spending money, we can subtract the amount he spent ($ 10) from the initial amount he had ($ 17): $ 17 - $ 10 = $ 7. Therefore, Edward had $ 7 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did more than 44 push-ups. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44. Now, we are given that David did 58 push-ups more than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 58 = 102 (since David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 102 - 58 = 44  Therefore, Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 44 + 58 = 102 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can divide the number of push-ups Zachary did by the number of push-ups David did:  Number of push-ups done by Zachary = 51  Number of push-ups done by David = 44  Difference between the two numbers = (Zachary's number - David's number) = (51 - 44) = 7  So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups in class today and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x push-ups, then we can write an equation as follows:  David did 44 push-ups, so Zachary did x - 9 push-ups. Now we have to solve for x. To do this, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation: x = 35. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups in class today.
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 push-ups. So, we can write an equation as follows:  David + Zachary = Total number of push-ups done.  In this case, the total number of push-ups is equal to 51 (David) plus 49 (Zachary), which equals 100. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches.  David did more than 19 push-ups but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 19 but less than 59. Therefore, David did 30 push-ups (since 30 is the only integer between 19 and 59).
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches.  We also know that David did more than 29 push-ups but fewer than 44 push-ups. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 29 but less than or equal to 44. Similarly, we know that David did y crunches where y is greater than 17 but less than or equal to 44 (since Zachary did 17 crunches). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + y = 44...(1) Since David did more push-ups than Zachary, we know that x > 29. Moreover, since David did fewer crunches than Zachary, we know that y < 17. Substituting these values into equation (1), we get:  x + y = 44...(1)  x > 29...(2) y < 17...(3) Solving for y, we get: y = 26 Since David did 29 push-ups and 26 crunches, the answer is 26.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. So, we can write this as Z = 53 + 14. Similarly, we know that David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 17 + 53 = 70 push-ups. However, David did 10 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 14 - 10 = 4 crunches. Therefore, the total number of push-ups and crunches done by Zachary is Z = 53 + 14 = 67, and the total number of push-ups and crunches done by David is D = 70 + 4 = 74.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches.  David did more than 58 push-ups but fewer than 87. So we can say that Zachary did x push-ups where x is between 35 and 58 (inclusive). Therefore, the answer is 42 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Push-ups = 46 Crunches = 58 - (Crunches - Push-ups) Now, we are given that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows:  Push-ups = 38 + 46 = 84 Since there are 62 less crunches than push-ups, we can write one final equation as follows:  Crunches = 58 - 62 = -4 Now, to find out how many more crunches Zachary did than David, we subtract the value of 'crunches' from the value of 'push-ups':  More crunches = 58 - (-4) = 62 Hence, Zachary did 62 more crunches than David.
Response:  We know that David did more than 39 push-ups because he is greater than Zachary who did 19 push-ups. So, if David did x push-ups, then Zachary did 19 - x push-ups. Since John did fewer push-ups than David, we can say that John did x - 13 push-ups. Now, we have two equations:  x + 19 = 39 (from the first equation) and x - 13 = 42 (from the second equation). Solving for x, we get:  x = 58. Therefore, David did 58 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 51 - 22 = 29 push-ups. Since John did 4 fewer push-ups than David, John did 29 + 4 = 33 push-ups. Therefore, John did 33 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did more than 39 push-ups. So, we can say that David did at least 44 push-ups (since he did more than 39). Now, we also know that John did fewer than 44 push-ups since he did 9 less than David. Therefore, Zachary did 15 + (44 - 9) = 26 push-ups more than John.
Response:  If David did 30 push-ups more than Zachary (which means David did 30 + X push-ups), then we can say that Zachary did x push-ups. So, if David did 37 push-ups, it means he did 37 - 30 = 7 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary did 7 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 56 push-ups more than Zachary. So, if we subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zachary, we will get the number of push-ups that Zachary did. Therefore, the answer is:  Push-ups done by Zachary = Total push-ups - Number of push-ups done by David.  In this case, the total number of push-ups was 56 + 38 = 94. So, the number of push-ups done by Zachary is:  Push-ups done by Zachary = 94 - 38 = 56.
Response:  We know that David did 40 push-ups more than Zachary and 17 less than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups, then David did 40 - 17 = 23 push-ups. Now we are given that David did 62 crunches. Therefore, the number of crunches Zachary did is 62 - 34 = 28 crunches.
Response:  We know that David did 36 push-ups more than Zachary (36 - 33 = 3). So if Zachary did 58 push-ups, then he must have done 21 push-ups less than David (58 - 3 = 25). Now we need to find out how many push-ups Zachary did compared to his crunches. If Zachary did 33 crunches, then he did 22 push-ups fewer than his crunches (33 - 22 = 11). Therefore, Zachary did 11 push-ups fewer than David.
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and 7 crunches less than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 5 push-ups, then he must have done x crunches where x is the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches that David did. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Push-ups = 5 + x Crunches = 17 - 7 = 10  Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. To do so, we can substitute the values given in the question into the equation:  Push-ups = 5 + x Crunches = 17 - 7 = 10  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Push-ups = 5 + x = 17 - 7 = 10  Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 3  Therefore, Zachary did 3 more crunches than push-ups he did.
Response:  Rachel has to solve 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more pages of math homework there are than pages of reading comprehension homework. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages of reading comprehension from the total number of pages of homework:  Number of pages of math homework = 5 pages Reading comprehension homework = 2 pages Total number of pages of homework = 5 + 2 = 7 pages Therefore, there are 7 - 2 = 5 more pages of math homework than pages of reading comprehension homework.
Response:  Rachel has to solve 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. To find out how many more pages of reading comprehension homework she has to do than math homework, we can subtract the number of pages of math homework from the total number of pages of homework:  Total number of pages = 3 (pages of math homework) + 4 (pages of reading comprehension homework) = 7 pages So, Rachel has to do 7 - 3 = 4 more pages of reading comprehension homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel needs to solve 5 pages of math homework and more than that for reading comprehension, then she needs to solve (more than 5) + 5 = 10 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel has already completed 7 pages of homework and she needs to complete 4 more pages, then the total number of pages she needs to complete is:  7 + 4 = 11 pages. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 11 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel has already solved 8 pages of homework and she needs to solve 3 more pages, then we can say that the total number of pages she needs to solve is 8 + 3 = 11 pages.
Response:  If Rachel has already solved 8 pages of homework from her math book, and she needs to solve 6 more pages, then we can calculate the total number of pages she needs to solve as follows: Total pages = 8 + 6 = 14 pages So, Rachel needs to solve 14 pages of homework from her math book.
Response:  If Rachel has already solved 10 pages of homework for math class and she needs to solve 3 more pages, then we can say that the total number of pages she needs to solve is 10 + 3 = 13 pages. Therefore, the answer is 13 pages.
Response:  Rachel needs to solve 2 pages of math homework and 3 pages of reading comprehension for a total of 5 pages. Then she has 10 additional pages of science homework, so that's another 10 pages in total. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 15 pages of homework in total.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to solve 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.  Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to solve is 9 + 2 = 11 pages.  Now we are asked how many more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework Rachel has. So let's subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension from the total number of pages of math homework: 11 - 2 = 9 pages.  Therefore, Rachel has 9 more pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  Rachel has to solve 11 pages of homework in mathematics and 2 pages of reading comprehension. Additionally, she needs to complete 3 more pages of math homework. Therefore, the total number of pages of math homework that Rachel needs to complete is 11 + 2 = 13 pages. So, there are 13 pages of math homework for every 3 pages of biology homework (3/13).
Response:  Rachel has to solve 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension. So far, she has 7 + 11 = 18 pages of work to do. Then, there are 8 more pages of science homework. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework that Rachel has is 18 + 8 = 26 pages.
Response:  If Rachel needs to solve 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension, then she has a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework to complete.
Response:  If Rachel needs to solve 8 pages of homework in mathematics and 7 pages are related to reading comprehension, then she has to solve 15 pages of homework (8 + 7 = 15). However, there is an additional 3 pages of homework in biology that she needs to complete, so the total number of pages of homework she needs to solve is 15 + 3 = 18 pages. Therefore, Rachel needs to solve 18 pages of homework.
Response:  Rachel needs to solve 5 pages of math homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension for her English class. Additionally, she has to complete 6 more pages of science homework in Biology. Therefore, the total number of pages that Rachel needs to complete is: 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages.
Response:  Rachel has to solve 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math problems. We know that there are more math problems than reading comprehension pages, so we can write an equation: Number of math problems = Number of reading comprehension pages + 4. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of math problems = 2 + 4 = 6. Therefore, Rachel has to solve 6 pages of math problems.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to solve 4 pages of homework in reading comprehension and 7 pages of homework in mathematics. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more pages she needs to solve in mathematics than in reading comprehension. To do this, we simply subtract the number of pages she needs to solve in reading comprehension from the total number of pages she needs to solve in both subjects combined. Mathematics: 7 pages Reading comprehension: 4 pages Total: 11 pages Therefore, Rachel needs to solve an additional 6 pages (11 - 4 = 6) of mathematics homework compared to her reading comprehension homework.
Response:  At morning time, Jack received 6 emails and at evening time he received 2 emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received during the morning is 8/2 = 4 more than the number of emails he received during the evening.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and at evening he received 10 emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 10 = 16 emails. Therefore, the number of emails that Jack received at evening is twice as many as those he received at morning.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the evening, then he must have received a total of 4 + x emails in one day, where x is the number of emails he received in the evening. Since we are given that Jack received 5 emails in the evening, we can write an equation as follows:  Total emails = 4 + 5 = 9. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails in one day.
Response:  At dawn, Jack received 6 emails (enam). In the afternoon, he received 3 more emails (tiga), so the total number of emails he received is now 6 + 3 = 9. Finally, at night, he received 5 more emails (lima), bringing the total to 9 + 5 = 14. Therefore, Jack received a total of 14 emails in one day.
Response:  At morning (8 e-mails), at noon (0 e-mails), and at night (72 e-mails). So, in total, Jack received 8 + 0 + 72 = 80 e-mails. Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  At dawn, Jack received 4 emails. Then at noon, he received another 5 emails, so the total number of emails he received until noon is 4 + 5 = 9. Next, at evening, he received 8 more emails, so the total number of emails he received until evening is 9 + 8 = 17. Finally, at night, he received 3 more emails, bringing the total to 17 + 3 = 20. Therefore, Jack received a total of 20 emails during the day and night.
Response:  At time 4 am, Jack received 3 emails. So at this time, he has received a total of 3 + 3 = 6 emails.  At time 4 pm, Jack received another 2 emails, so now he has received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails. And finally, at time 8 pm, Jack received 8 more emails, bringing his total to 8 + 8 = 16 emails. Therefore, Jack received a total of 6 emails during the morning and afternoon hours combined.
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation as follows: Morning = 10 + 7 = 17 Evening = 7 + 10 = 17 Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received during the morning to those he received during the evening. As shown above, Jack received 17 emails in total, with 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. Therefore, the ratio of emails Jack received during the morning to those he received during the evening is 10 : 7 or 2 : 3.
Response:  At morning time (10 e-mails), Jack received 10 emails.  At evening time (9 e-mails), Jack received 9 emails. So, in total, Jack received 19 emails (10 + 9). Therefore, the number of emails Jack received at morning time is 10/19 = 52.6% of the total emails he received.
Response:  At dawn (waktu pagi), Jack received 10 emails.  At noon (waktu petang), Jack received 5 more emails, so he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails.  At night (waktu malam), Jack received 4 more emails, so he received a total of 15 + 4 = 19 emails. Therefore, Jack received 19 emails in total during the evening and nighttime hours compared to the morning hours when he received 10 emails.
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and 3 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 9 emails during the day (morning + evening). So, if he received 10 emails in a day, then he must have received 1 email at night. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 email and 64 letters, so he totaly received 67 items (3 + 64). Then, in the evening, he received 5 emails and 54 letters, so he totaly received 121 items (5 + 54). Therefore, Jack terima 121 e-mel dalam sehari.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters, so he received a total of 11 items (emails + letters).  In the evening, Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 16 items (emails + letters) that day. Therefore, Jack terima 16 surat dalam sehari.
Response:  At dawn, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So far, he has received a total of 22 messages (10 emails + 12 letters). Then at dusk, he received 3 emails and 44 letters. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received at dusk is 3/22 = 0.1364 emails.
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and 10 letters.  In the evening, he received 2 emails and 7 letters. So, at night, Jack received more letters than emails. Therefore, the number of letters Jack received at night is 7 - 2 = 5.  Hence, the difference between the number of letters Jack received at morning and evening is 5.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. This means he received an email every 15 minutes (6/91 = 0.06).  Then in the evening, Jack received 2 more emails and sent 74 letters. So he received another email every 30 minutes (2/74 = 0.028). Therefore, Jack received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails in one day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 emails. So, he hantared 4 + 2 = 6 emails in the morning.  In the evening, Jack received 6 emails and sent 10 emails. So, he hantared 6 + 10 = 16 emails in the evening. Therefore, Jack hantared a total of 6 + 10 = 16 emails in one day.
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails per day and he received 7 emails in the morning, then he received x emails in the evening where x is equal to 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 additional emails in the evening.
Response:  At time morning (waktu pagi), Jack received 3 emails.  At time evening (waktu petang), Jack received 16 emails. So, in total, Jack received 3 + 16 = 19 emails during that day. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received at time morning is 19 / 2 = 9.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails at evening and additional ones in the evening, then he received total of 3 + x emails during the day (where x is the number of additional emails). Since he received 10 emails in a day, we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 10...(1) Now, let's solve for 'x'. We know that Jack received 3 emails at evening, so x = 3. Substituting this value into equation (1), we get: 3 + 3 = 10...(2) Simplifying equation (2), we have: 6 = 10...(3) Which means that Jack did not receive any emails during the day. Therefore, the answer is (D) None.
Response:  Belalang can jump 9 inches and frog can jump 12 inches. To find out how far frog is from belalang, we need to subtract the distance that belalang can jump from the distance that frog can jump. So, the answer is: Distance = 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, frog is 3 inches away from belalang.
Response:  Belalang and frog have to jump simultaneously.  The height of belalang is 31 inches, and that of the frog is 35 inches. To find out how many times they can jump together, we need to divide their respective jumps by each other. So, 31 / 35 = x, where x is the number of times they can jump together. Now, since both are jumping at the same time, the product of these numbers will give us the total distance traveled by both during one jump. Therefore, x × x = 765 (since the product of two numbers equal to 765). Thus, they can jump together 765 times.
Response:  Belalang melompat 36 inches, and katak melompat x inches more than that. So, katak melompat 36 + x = 52 inches. Now, we know that tikus melompat 15 inches less than katak, so tikus melompat 52 - 15 = 37 inches. Therefore, the distance katak jumped is 37 inches.
"Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 25 inches and Tikus can jump 2 inches more than Katak. So, if Katak can jump x inches, then Tikus can jump x + 2 inches. Now we are given that Belalang can jump 25 inches, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 2) = 25
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 2 = 25
Subtracting 2 from both sides:
2x = 23
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 11
Therefore, Tikus can jump 11 inches."
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 19 inches and Katak can jump 10 inches more than Belalang. So, Katak can jump 29 inches (10 + 19). Tikus can jump 20 inches more than Katak. Therefore, Tikus can jump 49 inches (20 + 29).
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 19 inches and Tikus can jump 94 inches. So, we have two equations:  Belalang + Tikus = Total distance (inches)  Belalang + Tikus - Katak = Total distance (inches) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations:  Equation 1: Belalang + Tikus = 19 + 94 = 113 inches  Equation 2: Belalang + Tikus - Katak = 113 - 39 = 74 inches Therefore, Katak can jump 74 inches.
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 25 inches and Tikus can jump 26 inches less than Belalang. So, Tikus can jump 26 - 26 = 0 inches. Therefore, Tikus did not jump at all.
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 24 inches and Tikus can jump 5 inches less than Belalang. So, Tikus can jump 29 inches (24 - 5 = 29). Now we need to find out how much longer Katak jumps than Tikus. According to the question, Katak jumps 33 inches more than Tikus. Therefore, Katak jumps 62 inches (33 + 29 = 62).
Response:  We know that the length of Belalang's jump is 13 inches and Katak's jump is 2 inches longer than Belalang's jump. So, Katak's jump is 15 inches (2 + 13 = 15). Therefore, the distance Katak jumped is 15 inches.
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 35 inches and the toad jumped 4 inches more than the frog. So, the toad jumped 39 inches (4 + 35). Now we need to find out how many times they both jumped equally far. To do this, we divide their total distance by each other's distance: $ \frac{39}{35} = 1.13$ times. Therefore, they both jumped the same distance $1.13$ times.
Response:  We know that Belalang (Frog) can jump 19 inches and Katak (Toad) can jump 44 inches. Tikus (Mouse) cannot jump as much as Belalang or Katak. So, we can conclude that Tikus must have jumped less than 19 inches. Now, let's calculate how far Katak jumped: Distance = Height x Speed (in this case, speed is equal to distance traveled by Tikus) Since Tikus did not jump as much as Katak, its distance traveled will be shorter than Katak's distance. Therefore, Katak jumped 44 - 4 = 36 inches.
Response:  We know that Belalang (Frog) can jump 39 inches and Katak (Toad) can jump 12 inches less than Frog. So, Katak can jump 39 - 12 = 27 inches. Tikus (Mouse) cannot jump as far as Katak because Tikus is shorter than Katak. Therefore, Tikus can only jump 27 / 4 = 6.75 inches.
Response:  We know that Belalang (Frog) can jump 21 inches and Tikus (Mouse) can jump 16 inches less than Frog. So, the distance between Frog and Mouse is: Distance = 21 - 16 = 5 inches. Therefore, Belalang jumps 5 inches more than Tikus.
Response:  Katak melompat 39 inci and Belalang melompat 17 inci. We need to find out how many times Katak can jump than Belalang. So we divide 39 (Katak) by 17 (Belalang).  Therefore, Katak can jump 2.28 times more than Belalang.
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 9 inches and Mouse can jump less than 3 inches shorter than Kangaroo who can jump 33 inches more than Belalang. So, if we let x be the distance that mouse can jump, then we have the following equation based on the information given in the problem: Distance = 3 + (Distance of Kangaroo - Distance of Belalang) = 3 + (33 - 9) = 40 inches Now, since the mouse can jump less than 3 inches shorter than Kangaroo, we know that the distance that mouse can jump is greater than or equal to 3 inches. Therefore, the distance that mouse can jump is between 3 and 40 inches inclusive. Since the distance that mouse can jump cannot exceed 40 inches, therefore the maximum possible distance that mouse can jump is 36 inches. Hence, the correct answer is 36 inches.
Response:  We know that Belalang (frog) jumped 14 inches and Mouse jumped less than 16 inches. So, we can say that Mouse jumped x inches where x is less than 16. Now, we are given that Katak (toad) jumped 37 inches more than Belalang. Therefore, the distance mouse jumped = 37 - 14 = 23 inches. Hence, the distance mouse jumped from belalang is 23 inches.
Response:  We know that Mary has already mixed 5 cups of flour into the dough, and she needs 9 more cups (14 - 5 = 9). So, she needs to add 9 more cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (which is 4/9 of the total amount needed), then we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added. We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar in total. So, if 4 cups have been added so far, that means there are 7 cups of sugar remaining to be added (11 - 4 = 7). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour and needs 8 more cups of flour, then she must have used some of the flour that was originally needed for the recipe. So, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already used from the total number of cups of flour required to make the recipe.  Therefore, if the recipe requires 6 cups of flour and Mary has already used some of it, then she needs 8 - x cups of flour where x is the amount of flour she has already used.  Since the recipe also requires 13 cups of sugar, we know that Mary needs at least 8 + 13 = 21 cups of ingredients in total to make the recipe.  So, if she only needs 8 more cups of flour, then she must have used at least 21 - 8 = 13 cups of flour already.
Response:  If Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and needs 2 more cups than she has, then she needs 9 cups of flour in total (since 11 - 2 = 9). So, the answer is 9.
"Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to the recipe and the recipe requires 11 cups in total, then we can calculate the remaining amount of flour needed as follows:

Remaining flour = Total flour required - Amount already added
= 11 cups - 3 cups
= 8 cups

Therefore, the recipe requires 8 cups of flour more than what Mary has already added."
Response:  If Mary has already put down 10 cups of flour (as stated in the problem), and she needs 12 cups total, then she still needs to add 2 more cups of flour. So, the number of cups of flour that Mary added is 2.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe so far. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required (9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour to complete her recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar to her mixture so far. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required (in this case, 14 cups). So, the number of additional cups of sugar Mary needs to add is:

14 - 2 = 12

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar to her mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to her mixture so far. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount of flour required (in this case, 12 cups). So, the number of additional cups of flour needed is:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Mary needs to add one more cup of flour to her mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already mixed 7 cups of flour into the dough. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required (in this case, 10 cups). So, the number of additional cups of flour needed is:

10 - 7 = 3

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has added 2 cups of flour so far and she needs 6 more cups to complete the recipe. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of cups of flour needed = 6 - 2 = 4 cups.  Therefore, Mary needs 4 more cups of flour than the amount of sugar required for the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and needs to add more. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add based on the original recipe. According to the recipe, for every cup of flour, there are 8 cups of sugar required. Therefore, if Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, then she needs to add 40 cups of sugar (5 x 8 = 40).
"Response:  If Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar and she needs 13 cups in total, then we can calculate how many more cups she needs as follows:

Number of remaining cups = Total amount needed - Amount already added
= 13 cups - 2 cups
= 11 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs 6 cups in total, then she still needs to add 2 cups (6 - 4 = 2) more cups of sugar. Therefore, the number of cups of flour that Mary needs to add is equal to the number of cups of sugar that she still needs to add, which is 2 cups. So, the answer is 2 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has added 2 cups of flour so far and she needs 9 cups of flour in total. So, we can calculate the number of cups of flour left to be added as follows: Number of cups of flour left = Total amount of flour needed - Amount already added = 9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups Therefore, there are 7 cups of flour left for Mary to add now.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and needs to add another 4 cups (since she only has 5 cups left). So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are needed if there are 4 cups of flour remaining.  Therefore, the number of cups of sugar needed is equal to 5 - 4 = 1 cup.
Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of sugar and needs 5 more cups than she has added, then we can calculate it as follows:  Number of cups of sugar needed = Total amount of sugar - Amount already added  In this case, the total amount of sugar is 3 cups (since the recipe requires 3 cups), and the amount already added is also 3 cups (since Mary has already added 3 cups). So, the number of cups of sugar needed is: Number of cups of sugar needed = 3 - 3 = 0 cups  Therefore, Mary does not need any additional cups of sugar beyond what she has already added.
Response:  If Mary has already added some amount of flour (which is not specified), then we know that she still needs to add 12 cups of flour more. So, if she adds 1 cup of flour at a time, she will need to add 12/1 = 12 cups of flour in total. Therefore, the answer is 12 cups.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required (in this case, 14 cups). So, the number of additional cups of flour needed is:

14 - 7 = 7

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cups of flour to her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and needs another 3 cups to complete the recipe. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added (10) from the total amount required for the recipe (13). Therefore, there are 3 more cups of sugar needed.
Response:  We know that Mary needs 3 cups of sugar, 10 cups of flour, and 15 cups of salt to make her recipe. She has already added 6 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount she has already added (6 cups) from the total amount needed (3 + 10 + 15 = 28). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 22 cups of flour (28 - 6 = 22).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour and needs to add more. To find out how many cups of flour she needs to add now, we can divide the total amount of flour required (9 cups) by the amount of flour she has already added (4 cups). So, the number of cups of flour she needs to add now is:  9 / 4 = 2.25 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has added 2 cups of flour so far and she needs 6 cups of flour in total to make the recipe. So, we need to find out how many cups of flour are left to be added now.  To do this, we can divide the number of cups of flour needed (6) by the number of cups of flour added so far (2): 6 / 2 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 cups of flour left to be added now.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (since she only has 6 cups of sugar left). So, we can calculate the number of cups of sugar needed as follows:

Number of cups of sugar = Total amount of sugar required - Number of cups of sugar already used
= 9 cups - 6 cups
= 3 cups
Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe."
"Response:  If Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs 7 more cups, then we can calculate how many cups she still needs to add as follows:

Total amount of sugar needed = 7 - 4 = 3 cups
So, Mary still needs to add 3 cups of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the mixture, which means she still needs to add 2 more cups (12 - 10 = 2). Now we need to find out how many cups of flour are needed based on the amount of sugar added. According to the recipe, for every cup of sugar used, 1.5 cups of flour are required. So if Mary needs to add 2 cups of sugar, then she needs to add 3 cups of flour (2 x 1.5 = 3). Therefore, the number of cups of flour that Mary needs to add now is 3 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain. If 60 families fly away for winter, then the number of families remaining behind is:  19 - 60 = -41 families. So, there are 41 fewer families of birds staying behind than flying away to escape the cold weather.
Response:  If 7 families of birds flew away for winter, then there are 80 families (87 - 7) left behind. So, the number of families of birds that stayed behind is 80.
Response:  We know that there are 20 families of birds that fly away for winter and 14 families that stay behind. So, we need to find out how many families stayed behind initially.  The initial number of families can be calculated as follows: Total number of families = Number of families that fly away + Number of families that stay behind Initial number of families = Total number of families - Number of families that fly away = 20 (families that fly away) + 14 (families that stay behind) = 34 families That means there were 34 families of birds that stayed behind initially near the mountain.
Response:  If 23 families of birds flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia, then the total number of families that left is 23 + 37 = 60.  So, there are 60 - 23 = 37 families of birds left near the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near a mountain. If 42 families fly to Africa and 31 families fly to Asia, then we can calculate the number of families flying to Africa as follows: Number of families flying to Africa = Total number of families - Number of families flying to Asia = 8 - 31 = 53 families Therefore, there are 53 families of birds flying to Africa more than the number of families flying to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain. If 47 families fly to Africa and 94 families fly to Asia, then we can calculate the number of families flying to Asia as follows: Number of families flying to Asia = Total number of families - Number of families flying to Africa Total number of families = 38 + (47 x 1) = 38 + 47 = 85 Therefore, there are 85 families of birds flying to Asia.
Response:  If 38 families of birds fly to Africa and 80 families fly to Asia, then the total number of families that flew away is: 38 + 80 = 118 families.  Since there are initially 18 families living near the mountain, the remaining number of families after some families have flown away is: 18 - x, where x is the number of families that flew away.  Therefore, the number of families that flew away for winter is: 118 - 18 = 100 families.
Response:  If there are currently 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families join them, then the total number of families of birds living near the mountain is now: 87 + 18 = 105 families.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 families of birds living near the mountain during the warm season. Then, 59 families of birds fly away to escape the cold weather and only 24 new families arrive from the Arctic region to live nearby the mountain. Therefore, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is: 49 + (59 - 24) = 73 families.
Response:  We know that there are 27 families of birds flying away for winter and they live near a mountain. If there were initially 41 families of birds living nearby the mountain, then after 27 families flew away for winter, how many families of birds would still be left living nearby the mountain? So, the answer is 41 - 27 = 14 families of birds would still be living nearby the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are 86 families of birds flying away for winter and they come from near the mountain. If there were 45 families of birds living nearby the mountain at first, then how many more families flew away to escape the cold than those who lived behind the mountain initially?  Therefore, the answer is 41 (45 - 41 = 4).
Response:  We know that there are 41 families of birds living near a mountain. If 35 families fly to Asia and 62 families fly to Africa, then we can calculate the number of families flying to Africa as follows: Number of families flying to Africa = Total number of families - Number of families flying to Asia = 41 - 35 = 7 families Therefore, 7 families of birds flew to Africa from the area near the mountain.
Response:  Firstly, there are already 3 families of birds living near the mountain. Then, 26 new families of birds come to live near the mountain from the Arctic while 2 families fly away to the south for winter. So, the total number of families of birds living near the mountain is: 3 + 26 = 29 families.
Response:  At first, Paul got 253 pensils of different colors for his birthday. Then he lost or gave away 70 of them by the end of the school year. So, how many pensils does Paul have left? We can calculate it as follows: Number of pensils Paul has = Total number of pensils - Number of pensils given away/lost = 253 - 70 = 183 pensils Therefore, Paul has 183 pensils of different colors left at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 551 pensils in total and he only has 177 left. So, we can calculate how many pensils he had initially as follows: Number of pensils Paul had initially = Total number of pensils - Number of pensils he currently has = 551 - 177 = 374 pensils. Therefore, Paul has 374 pensils for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 440 pensils for his birthday and gave away 111 pensils to his friends during the school year while losing 106 pensils. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pensils Paul has = Total number of pensils - Number of pensils given away - Number of pensils lost  Number of pensils Paul has = 440 - 111 + (-106)  Number of pensils Paul has = 223 pensils Therefore, Paul has 223 pensils left.
Response:  If Paul received 65 pensils for his birthday and gave away 213 pensils to his friends during the school year while losing 16 pensils, then we can calculate as follows:  Number of pensils given away = 213 Number of pensils lost = 16 Total number of pensils = Number of pensils given away + Number of pensils lost = 213 + 16 = 229 So, there are 229 pensils in total.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 pensils for his birthday and gave away 571 pensils to his friends during the school year while he lost 161 pensils. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pensils given away = 571 Pensils lost = 161 Now, let's solve this equation. To find out how many more pensils Paul gave away than he lost, we need to subtract the number of pensils lost from the number of pensils given away. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of additional pensils that Paul gave away. In other words, the answer to the question is:  Difference = 571 - 161 = 410 Additional pensils given away by Paul.
Response:  If Paul gave away 90 pensils and lost 412 pensils, then he has 412 - 90 = 322 pensils left. So, the number of pensils that he gave away is equal to the number of pensils he has left, which is 322. Therefore, the answer is 322.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 pensils and lost 558 pensils, then he has 7 pensils left. So, if he only has 332 pensils of colorful pens, he can have at most 332 - 7 = 325 pensils for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul has 492 pensils left after giving away 52 pensils to his friends. So, he had 492 - 52 = 440 pensils initially. Now, we are told that he lost 535 pensils. Therefore, the number of pensils he lost is equal to 535 - 440 = 195 pensils. So, there were 195 pensils missing or given away.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 pensils and used 66 of them. So he has 455 pensils left (521 - 66 = 455). Now we are asked how many pensils he had at the end of the year. The answer is 154, which means that 301 pensils were either lost or given away (455 - 154 = 301).
Response:  We know that Paul has 531 pensils and 38 erasers at the beginning of the year. If he doesn't lose any erasers during the year, then the number of erasers he has left is equal to the original amount minus the number he had at the end of the year. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of erasers = 531 - 391 = 140 erasers. Therefore, there are 140 more erasers than pensils that Paul has.
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 pensils and used 406 of them. So he has 205 pensils left at the end of the year (601 - 406 = 205). Now we want to find out how many pencils are left after he didn't lose any. Since he didn't lose any, all 205 pensils are still there. Therefore, the number of pencils Paul has is 205.
Response:  We know that Paul received 400 pensils for his birthday and he gave or lost 315 of them. So, we have to find out how many pensils are left with him after giving or losing some. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of pensils left = Total number of pensils - Number of pensils given or lost Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation: Number of pensils left = 400 - 315 = 85 Therefore, there are 85 pensils left with Paul after giving or losing some.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received 267 pensils for his birthday and lost 231 pensils during the school year. So, he has 36 pensils left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, let's see how many more pensils he gave away than he had left. He gave away 308 pensils to his friends, which is more than the number of pensils he had left (36 > 308). Therefore, the difference between the number of pensils he gave away and the number of pensils he had left is equal to the number of pensils he had left minus the number of pensils he gave away: 308 - 36 = 272. So, Paul gave away 272 more pensils than he had left.
Response:  We know that Paul has 457 erasable blocks and 320 pens. At the end of the year, he only has 523 remaining while not losing any erasable blocks. So, we can deduce that Paul had more pens than erasable blocks at the beginning of the year. Therefore, the number of pens Paul has is greater than the number of erasable blocks he has. In other words, the difference between the number of pens and erasable blocks is positive. To find out exactly how many more pens Paul has than erasable blocks, we need to subtract the number of erasable blocks from the total number of pens he has: (Number of pens) - (Number of erasable blocks) = 320 - 457 = -137 The negative sign indicates that Paul has more pens than erasable blocks. So, the correct answer is (-137).
Response:  At first, the servant had 11 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving him with 3 customers remaining. So, the number of customers who stayed is equal to the original number minus the number that left. In this case, the number of customers who stayed is 11 - 4 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 customers left.
Response:  If the servant has 3 customers initially and some of them leave, then he still has 4 customers left. So, the number of customers who left is equal to the initial number of customers minus the number of customers remaining. In this case, we can write it as follows: Number of customers who left = Initial number of customers - Remaining number of customers = 3 - 4 = -1 customer Therefore, there are 1 fewer customer behind those who left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers (S). After they left, he still had 12 customers (T). So, the number of customers at the beginning was T - S = 12 - 9 = 3.
Response:  We know that there are 14 customers in total and 5 of them live far away. So, we need to subtract 5 from 14 to get the number of customers who do not live far away. Therefore, the number of customers who do not live far away is 14 - 5 = 9.
Response:  At first, there were 13 customers. Then some of them left, so there are fewer customers now. After that, 4 new customers arrived, bringing the total number to 17 (13 + 4). So, there are currently 17 customers remaining.
Response:  The pelayan has 12 original customers and gets 15 new customers while 15 of his existing customers leave. So, the total number of customers he has now is:  Original Customers + New Customers = 12 + 15 = 27 Customers. Therefore, there are 27 customers left for the pelayan.
Response:  The first servant has 3 customers initially. Then, after some people arrive, there are 8 customers in total. So, to find out how many new customers arrived, we need to subtract the initial number of customers from the total number of customers now:  New customers = Total customers - Initial customers  = 8 - 3  = 5 new customers arrived.
Response:  At first, the servant has 8 customers. Then some of them leave, so he still has 5 customers left. After that, he gets 99 new customers, so the total number of customers now is: 8 + 5 - x = 99 where x is the number of customers who left. Solving for x, we get x = 3. Therefore, there are 10 (8 + 5) customers in total.
Response:  At first, the servant had 12 customers. Then some of them left, so he still had 14 customers. Later, he got 10 new customers, bringing the total number to how many?  Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has $ 3 left after buying a bag of candy for $ 2. So, he has $ 3 - $ 2 = $ 1 remaining money. Therefore, the amount of money that Dan had initially is $ 1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spent $3 on candy. So, how much money does Dan have left? $$ = \text { amount of money left } = \text { initial amount of money - amount spent } = 4 - 3 = 1$$ Therefore, there are 1 dollar left after Dan bought the candy.
Response:  We know that Dan has $ 4 and he bought 99 pieces of candy with each piece costing $ 3. So, we can calculate the total amount spent as follows: Total amount = Number of candies x Price per candy Total amount = 99 x $ 3 Total amount = $ 297 Now, we need to find out how much money is left after buying the candies. Money left = Initial money - Amount spent Money left = $ 4 - $ 297 Money left = -$ 293 Therefore, there are $ 293 left in Dan's pocket after buying the candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $ 3 to spend. Then he buys 2 packets of candy with each packet costing $ 4. So, in total, Dan spends $ 8 (2 x $ 4). Therefore, the price of one packet of candy is $ 4 / 2 = $ 2 per packet.
Response:  If Dan has $ 2 and he buys some candy for $ 6 per one piece of candy, then he can buy how many pieces of candy with his money?  We know that the cost of each piece of candy is $ 6, so we need to divide $ 2 (the amount of money Dan has) by $ 6 (the cost of each piece of candy): $ 2 / $ 6 = x (where x is an integer). Since Dan wants to buy as many pieces of candy as possible, we should choose the largest value of x that makes sense in this context. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Dan can buy is x = 4. So, Dan buys 4 pieces of candy.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $ 7. Then he buys chocolates for $ 2 and candies for $ 3. So, the total amount of money Dan spends is $ 2 + $ 3 = $ 5. Therefore, after buying these sweets, Dan has $ 7 - $ 5 = $ 2 left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan has $ 4 to spend. Then he buys gula-gula which costs $ 7 and coklat which costs $ 6. So, in total, Dan spends $ 7 + $ 6 = $ 13. Therefore, Dan pays $ 13 for the gula-gula and coklat.
Response:  If Dan spends $ 2 to buy gula-gula, then he has $ 2 - $ 6 = $ -4 left for buying coklat. So, he will spend $ -4 to buy coklat. Therefore, the amount of money that Dan spent to buy gula-gula is $ 6 / $ -4 = 15 times more than the amount he spent to buy coklat.
Response:  If Dan spends $ 5 to buy both chocolate and sugar, then he will spend $ 5 / 2 = $ 2.50 for each item. So, if he buys chocolate, he will spend $ 3 more than he spent on sugar, which is $ 2.50 + $ 3 = $ 5.50. Therefore, Dan pays $ 5.50 for the chocolate compared to $ 2.50 for the sugar.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has $ 4. Then he buys candy for $ 8. So, his remaining money is $ 4 - $ 8 = -$ 4. Therefore, there are no dollars left after giving $ 5 to his friend.
Response:  If Dan has $3 left after buying candy and he had $4 at the beginning, then we can calculate the cost of each piece of candy as follows: Cost per piece = Total amount of money / Number of pieces of candy Total amount of money = $4 Initial amount + $3 Left after buying candy = $7 Number of pieces of candy = Total amount of money / Cost per piece = $7 / $1 = 7 pieces So, the cost of each piece of candy is $1.
"Response:  We know that Dan has $ 4 and he buys 10 packets of candy each worth the same amount of money as his remaining balance. So we can write an equation based on this information:

$ 4 = x (where x is the number of packets of candy)

Now, since each packet of candy costs the same amount of money as Dan's remaining balance, we can rewrite the above equation as follows:

x = $ 4 / number of packets of candy

We are given that Dan buys 10 packets of candy, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

x = $ 4 / 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = $ 0.40 or $ 40 cents

Therefore, there are 40 cents left after Dan buys 10 packets of candy with $ 4."
"Response:  We know that Dan has $ 3 and he buys 2 packages of candy each worth the same amount of money. So we can write an equation as follows:
Dan has $ 3 + (2 x cost per package) = Total spending
We are given that the cost per package is equal to the amount of money Dan has ($ 3). Therefore, we can substitute this value into the above equation:
$ 3 + (2 x $ 3) = Total spending
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$ 7 = Total spending
Therefore, the cost per package of candy is $ 7."
Response:  If Dan spent $ 5 for something else, and he bought chocolate for $ 3, then he had $ 5 - $ 3 = $ 2 left.  And if he spent $ 7 for sugar, then he had $ 2 - $ 7 = -$ 5 left (since we are subtracting the amount he spent from the initial amount). So, Dan spent more money to buy sugar than he did to buy chocolate.
Response:  If Dan spent $ 4 to buy chocolate and $ 2 for sugar, then he spent a total of $ 6. So, if he bought chocolate that was worth $ 7 more than the money he spent, then the cost of one piece of chocolate is $ 7 - $ 6 = $ 1. Therefore, the number of pieces of chocolate that Dan can buy with the $ 4 he has is $ 4 / $ 1 = 4 pieces.
Response:  We know that Paul has 115 books in total. He sells 78 of them in a garage sale. So, how many books does he have left?  Books remaining = Total number of books - Number of books sold in garage sale  Books remaining = 115 - 78  Books remaining = 37 Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 200 books initially. He sold 137 of them and was left with 105 books. So, the number of books he had initially is equal to the number of books he has now minus the number of books he sold. Therefore, the answer is:  $200 - 137 = 63$ books.
Response:  We know that Paul has 108 books in total and he sells some of them at a garage sale. After selling some books, he is left with 62 books. So, we can say that the number of books he sold = Number of books remaining - Initial number of books (108 - 62) = 46 books. Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul has 50 books initially and after selling some of them in the garage sale, he has 151 left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books bought = Total number of books - Number of books sold  In this case, the total number of books is 50 (initially) + 151 (after selling some). Therefore, the number of books bought by Paul is:  Number of books bought = 50 + 151 = 201 books  So, Paul bought 201 books at the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had two books initially and sold some of them at his garage sale, then he has fewer books left.  We know that after selling some books, he bought 150 new ones. So, the total number of books he has now is 58 (the initial number minus the number sold). Therefore, the answer is 58.
Response:  If Paul has 21 books and sells some of them, then he will have fewer books left. Let's assume that he sold x books. Then, his remaining number of books is 21 - x. After that, he bought 42 new books, so his total number of books now is 21 - x + 42. To find out how many books he sold compared to the ones he bought, we need to divide the number of books he sold (x) by the number of books he bought (42). Therefore, the answer is x / 42.
Response:  If Paul has 71 books and sells some of them, he will have fewer books left. Let's assume that he sold x books. Then, his remaining number of books is 71 - x. After buying new books, his total number of books becomes 38 + (71 - x) = 38 + 39 = 77 books. So, the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold is 77 - x. Therefore, the answer to the question is 77 - x.
Response:  We know that Paul has 108 books and 55 pens initially. After selling some of them at the market, he has 66 books left. Now we need to find out how many books he sold at the market. To do this, we can use the information that after selling some books, he has 66 books left, which means he must have had 42 books (108 - 66 = 42) before selling any books. So, the number of books he sold at the market is 42. Similarly, we can find out the number of pens he sold by using the information that after selling some pens, he has 59 pens left, which means he must have had 36 pens (55 - 59 = -3) before selling any pens. Therefore, the number of pens he sold at the market is also -3.
"Response:  We know that Paul has 51 books and 106 pens at first. After selling some of them in the market, he has 82 books left and 14 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Books = 51 - x Pens = 106 - 14 Where ""x"" is the number of pens sold in the market. Now, we need to find out how many pens Paul sold in the market. To do this, we can substitute the value of ""x"" into the second equation: Books = 51 - (106 - 14) = 51 - 92 = -45 Pens = 106 - 14 = 92 Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens in the market."
Response:  If Paul has 136 books initially and sells some of them in his garage sale, leaving him with 27 books, then we can find out how many books he sold by subtracting the number of books he left with from the initial number of books he had. So, the answer is:  Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Number of books left after the sale = 136 - 27 = 109 books
Response:  We know that Paul has 134 books in total and he gives away 39 of them to his friend. So now, Paul has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sells some books at a garage sale and is left with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books Paul sold at the garage sale is:  Number of books remaining after garage sale = 68 Books sold at garage sale = Total number of books available for sale - Number of books remaining after garage sale = 68 - 95 = 27 books
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 95 books and 153 pens. After selling some of them at the market, he has 13 books and 23 pens left. To find out how many books he sold at the market, we can subtract the number of books he has now (13) from the initial number of books he had (95): 95 - 13 = 82 books. So, Paul sold 82 books at the market.
Response:  We know that Paul has 42 pens and 143 books initially. After selling some of his books and pens at the market, he has 113 books and 19 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Number of pens = 42 + (Number of books sold x Price per book) Number of pens = 42 + (143 x $5) Number of pens = 42 + 715 Number of pens = 757 Now, we need to find out how many pens Paul sold at the market. To do this, we divide the number of pens he had after selling by the number of pens he had initially: Number of pens sold = Number of pens after selling / Number of pens initial Number of pens sold = 757 / 42 Number of pens sold = 18 Therefore, Paul sold 18 pens at the market.
Response:  If there are initially 10 marigold flowers in the vase and Jessica cuts off 8 more from the flower garden and puts them into the vase, then the total number of marigold flowers in the vase now is:  Initially, there were 10 marigold flowers in the vase = 10 x 8 = 80 marigold flowers in the vase after Jessica adds the new ones = 80 + 8 = 88 marigold flowers in the vase now. Therefore, there are 88 marigold flowers in the vase now.
Response:  At first, there were only 4 bunga mawar in the vase (Ada). Then, Jessica cut 16 more bunga mawar from the flower garden and put them into the vase (Jessica memotong). So, now there are 20 bunga mawar in the vase (Kini terdapat 20 bunga mawar dalam pasu). Finally, we are asked how many bunga mawar were originally in the vase (Berapa banyak bunga mawar yang ada dalam pasu pada mulanya)? To find this, we need to subtract the number of bunga mawar that Jessica added (16) from the total number of bunga mawar in the vase now (20): 20 - 16 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 bunga mawar in the vase at the beginning (Berapa banyak bunga mawar yang ada dalam pasu pada mulanya).
Response: 1) Ada 2 bunga mawar dalam pasu initially. 2) Jessica membuang 4 bunga mawar dari pasu bunga, so now there are 6 (2 + 4) bunga mawar in the jar. 3) She cut some new flowers from the garden and added them to the jar, making the total number of flowers 23. Therefore, the number of flowers that she cut was 17 (23 - 6).
Response:  Firstly, Jessica bought 33 bunga mawar from the flower shop and added them to the vase of flowers. Then she cut some fresh bunga mawar from the garden and put them into the same vase. After that, there are now 17 bunga mawar in the vase. So, how many more bunga mawar did Jessica cut than the ones she brought from the shop? We can find this difference by subtracting the number of bunga mawar she brought (33) from the total number of bunga mawar in the vase after adding both sets (40). Therefore, the answer is 6 (33 - 40 = 6).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessica has 34 bunga mawar from the flower bed and she cut some new ones from her garden to add into the mixture. So, there are now 15 bunga mawar in the mixture.  To find out how many more bunga mawar Jessica cut than she added, we can subtract the number of new bunga mawar (34) from the total number of bunga mawar in the mixture (15):  34 - 15 = 19 Therefore, Jessica cut 19 more bunga mawar than she added to the mixture.
Response:  We know that Jessica cut some more marigolds from a garden with 59 marigolds in total. Now there are 20 marigolds left in the pot. So, we need to find out how many marigolds Jessica cut. To do this, we can divide the number of marigolds left (20) by the total number of marigolds before (59). Therefore, Jessica cut 39 marigolds (59 - 20 = 39).
Response:  We know that there are currently 21 bunga in the vase. If we subtract the number of bunga that Jessica cut from the total number of bunga in the garden (which is 12), then we can determine how many bunga were left in the garden after she cut some. Therefore, the number of bunga left in the garden = Total number of bunga - Number of bunga cut = 21 - 12 = 9 bunga. So, there are 9 bunga mawar left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 bunga mawar and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more bunga mawar and orchids from the garden. Now, there are 17 bunga mawar and 96 orchids in the vase. So, we can calculate how many bunga mawar Jessica cut as follows: Number of bunga mawar cut = Total number of bunga mawar - Initial number of bunga mawar = 17 - 15 = 2 Therefore, Jessica cut 2 bunga mawar from the garden.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 12 bunga mawar and 2 orkid in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more orchids from her garden. After that, she put them into the same vase with the existing ones. So now, there are 10 bunga mawar and 21 orkid in the vase. To find out how many orkid Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of orkid (2) from the current number of orkid (21):  Therefore, Jessica cut 19 orkid.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 bunga mawar and 3 orkid in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more bunga mawar and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 12 bunga mawar and 2 orkid in the vase. So, we can calculate the number of additional bunga mawar as follows: Number of additional bunga mawar = Total number of bunga mawar now - Initial total number of bunga mawar = 12 - 5 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 more bunga mawar than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 marigolds and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from the garden to add to the vase. This means that now there are 11 marigolds and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than marigolds are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of marigolds from the total number of orchids:  Number of orchids = 20 - 11 = 9 So, there are 9 more orchids than marigolds in the vase now.
Response:  If there were initially 3 bunga mawar in the vase and Jessica cut 6 of them to put into the vase, then the number of bunga mawar left in the vase is 3 - 6 = -3. So, if there are currently 19 bunga mawar in the vase, it means that Jessica has cut a total of 19 + (-3) = 16 bunga mawar from the original 3 bunga mawar in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 marigolds and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from the garden to add to the vase. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 marigolds in the vase. So, we can calculate how many marigolds Jessica cut as follows: Number of marigolds cut = Total number of marigolds - Initial number of marigolds = 14 - 13 = 1 Therefore, Jessica cut 1 marigold.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 bunga mawar and 3 orkid in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more orchids and bougainvilleas from the garden. Now, there are 7 orkid and 13 bougainvilleas in the vase. So, we can deduce that Jessica cut 4 orkid from the vase (since there were originally 3 orkid and now there are only 7). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 6 bunga mawar and 20 orkid in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more orchids from the flower garden. Now, there are 21 orchids and 22 bunga mawar in the vase. To find out how many more bunga mawar than orchids there are now, we can subtract the number of orchids that Jessica cut (which is 4) from the total number of bunga mawar:  Number of bunga mawar = 22 - 4 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 more bunga mawar than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 bunga mawar and 6 orkid in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more orchids and marigolds from the garden. Now, there are 13 orkid and 3 marigolds in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than marigolds are now in the vase, we can subtract the number of marigolds from the number of orkid:  Number of orkid - Number of marigolds = 13 - 3 = 10 So, there are 10 more orchids than marigolds in the vase now.
Response:  If Rambut Robin is currently 17 inches long and she cuts off some inches of her hair, then the new length of her hair will be 13 inches. So, to find out how many inches of hair she cut off, we can subtract the new length from the original length:  17 - 13 = 4 inches. Therefore, Rambut Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.
Response:  Before Robin cut his hair, it was 20 inches long. Now, after he cut it, it is 10 inches long. So, to find out how long his hair was before he cut it, we can subtract the length of his current hair from its original length: 20 - 10 = 10 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair was 10 inches long before he cut it.
Response:  At first, Robin had long hair that was 16 inches (16 in). Then she cut it to 11 inches (11 in). Later, her hair grew again and reached 12 inches (12 in) in length. So, now Robin's hair is 13 inches (13 in) long (from 11 in - 12 in = 1 in).
Response:  If Rambut Robin is currently 19 inches long and she grows an additional 18 inches, then her new length would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Rambut Robin now has 37 inches of hair.
Response:  If Robin cut his hair to 13 inches long initially and then grew it back to its original length of 14 inches, how much longer is his current hair than when he first cut it? So, the answer is 14 - 13 = 1 inch.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rambut Robin is initially 14 inches long. Then, she cut off 20 inches of her hair, which means she has 4 inches left (14 - 20 = 4). So, the length of Rambut Robin's hair now is 4 inches.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 bottles initially and then he met 53 more bottles in the park. So, the total number of bottles Danny has now is:  12 + 53 = 65   Therefore, the answer is 65.
Response:  If Danny has 21 bottles in his collection and he met 5 of them in the park, then there are 21 - 5 = 16 bottles left in his collection. So, if he meets 9 more bottles in the park, then there are 16 + 9 = 25 bottles that he met in total (including both his collection and the ones he met in the park). Therefore, the number of bottles that Danny met in the park is 25.
Response:  At first, Danny gathered 70 bottles (70 - 51 = 19). Then he threw away 51 old bottles and now has 33 bottles left in his collection (33 / 2 = 16.5). So, initially, Danny had 19 bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny collected 35 old bottles and threw away 35 bottles. So, he has 22 new bottles in his collection now.  To find out how many more bottles Danny picked up besides those he threw away, we need to subtract the number of bottles he threw away from the total number of bottles he collected. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of additional bottles = Total number of bottles collected - Number of bottles thrown away = 22 - 35 = -13
Response:  We know that Danny collected 42 bottles after he threw away 63 old bottles in the park. So, the total number of bottles he threw away is 63 - 42 = 21. Therefore, the number of additional bottles Danny threw away outside of the park is 21.
Response:  At first, Danny had 10 tutup botol and 5 bungkus (as mentioned in the problem). Then he collected more tutup botol and bungkus from the park. So, after collecting them all, Danny had 28 tutup botol and 63 bungkus. Therefore, the number of tutup botol that Danny had at first is 28 - 10 = 18.
Response:  At first, Danny had 22 tubes and 30 boxes in his collection. Then he collected more tubes and boxes as follows:  + 17 tubes = 49 tubes  + 57 boxes = 107 boxes So initially, Danny had 57 boxes.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 bottles and packed 14 boxes in the park. Now he has 7 bottles and 86 boxes with him. To find out how many more bottles than boxes Danny collected, we can subtract the number of boxes from the number of bottles: 7 - 14 = -7. So, Danny collected fewer bottles than boxes. Therefore, the answer is -7.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 11 bottle caps and 28 boxes in the park. So far, he has 68 bottle caps and 51 boxes in his collection. Now we need to find out how many more box than bottle cap he found in the park. To do this, we can divide the number of boxes he found (28) by the number of bottle caps he found (11). This gives us a ratio of boxes per bottle cap, which is 28/11 = 2.57. Since Danny already had 51 boxes in his collection before going to the park, we can add the new amount he found (28) to the original amount he had, giving him a total of 79 boxes now. Therefore, there are 79 - 51 = 28 more boxes than bottle caps that Danny found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 71 bottle caps and 24 boxes in the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 boxes in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps than boxes Danny has now, we can subtract the number of boxes from the number of bottle caps:  Number of bottle caps - Number of boxes = 28 - 16 = 12 Therefore, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than boxes now.
Response:  We know that Danny had 10 tutup botol and 62 bungkus in his collection initially. Then he collected more items, which resulted in him having 27 tutup botol and 43 bungkus now. To find out how many more bungkus than tutup botol Danny has, we can subtract the number of tutup botol from the total number of bungkus:  Number of bungkus > Number of tutup botol = 43 - 10 = 33 Therefore, there are 33 more bungkus than tutup botol that Danny currently has.
Response:  At first, Danny had 100 tubes (tutup botol). Then he lost 66 of them in the park. So, he has 34 tubes left (25 + 9 = 34). Therefore, Danny had 100 tubes at first.
Response:  Before Danny found 32 bottle caps in the park, he had 25 bottle caps in his collection. So, the number of bottle caps that Danny met in the park is equal to the difference between the total number of bottle caps and the number of bottle caps he already had:  $32 - 25 = 9$  Therefore, there are 9 additional bottle caps that Danny met in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 60 old bottles in his collection. Then he found 58 new bottles and added them to his collection. So, now he has 67 bottles in total. To find out how many bottles Danny had at first, we can subtract the number of new bottles (58) from the total number of bottles he has now (67): 67 - 58 = 9. Therefore, Danny initially had 9 bottles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny threw away 6 old bottles in the garden while he met 50 new bottles. So, now he has 60 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps Danny collected besides the ones he threw away, we need to subtract the number of bottles he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he collected:  Number of bottle caps collected = Total number of bottle caps - Number of bottles thrown away  In this case, the total number of bottle caps is 60 (as given in the question), and the number of bottles thrown away is 6. Therefore, the number of bottle caps Danny collected besides the ones he threw away is:  Number of bottle caps collected = 60 - 6 = 54  So, Danny collected 54 additional bottle caps besides the ones he threw away in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny collected 54 old bottles in the garden and then he met 48 new bottles. So, now he has 52 bottles in his collection. To find out how many more bottles Danny threw away than he found, we need to subtract the number of new bottles (48) from the total number of bottles he had after collecting them all (52). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of additional bottles thrown away = Total number of bottles after collection - Number of new bottles found = 52 - 48 = 4.
Response:  We know that Danny gathered 82 bungkus and 29 tutup botol in the park. So initially, he had 82 + 29 = 111 items. Now, he has 42 tutup botol and 61 bungkus, so he lost 111 - (42 + 61) = 70 items. Therefore, initially, Danny had 70 tutup botol.
Response:  We know that Danny gathered 66 bungkus and 39 tutup botol in the park. So initially, he had 66 + 39 = 105 items. Now, he has 16 tutup botol and 68 bungkus, so he lost 49 items (105 - 49 = 56). Therefore, initially, Danny had 56 bungkus.
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 bungkus and 50 tutup botol in the park. So far, he has 21 tutup botol and 52 bungkus in his collection. To find out how many more tutup botol than bungkus, we need to subtract the number of bungkus from the total number of tutup botol. Therefore, the difference between the number of tutup botol and bungkus is:  
(50 - 52) = -2 = 2 less tutup botol than bungkus  So, there are 2 fewer tutup botol than bungkus that Danny collected in the park."
Response:  We know that Danny collected 65 bungkus and 5 tutup botol in the park. So far, he has 31 tutup botol and 9 bungkus in his collection. To find out how many more bungkus than tutup botol Danny collected, we need to subtract the number of bungkus from the total number of tutup botol. Therefore, the difference between the number of bungkus and tutup botol is:  Number of bungkus - Total number of tutup botol = 9 - 65 = -57  So, Danny collected 57 more bungkus than tutup botol in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 58 bottles and packed 25 boxes in the park. Now he has 11 boxes and 12 bottles in his collection. To find out how many more bottles than boxes Danny has, we can subtract the number of boxes from the total number of bottles:  Number of bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of boxes  In this case, the total number of bottles is 58 + 25 = 83. Subtracting the number of boxes (11) gives us the difference between the number of bottles and boxes:  Number of bottles minus Number of boxes = 83 - 11 = 72 Therefore, there are 72 more bottles than boxes in Danny's collection now.
Response:  We know that Danny gathered 15 bottles and packed 18 boxes in the park. Now he has 67 boxes and 35 bottles in his collection. To find out how many more boxes than bottles Danny has, we can subtract the number of bottles from the number of boxes:  Number of boxes - Number of bottles = 67 - 35 = 32 Therefore, there are 32 more boxes than bottles in Danny's collection now.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has 17 apples, then Steven must have 6 (17 - 11 = 6) apples. Therefore, Steven has 6 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples more than Jill, then Jake has x - 7 apples less than Steven. Also, we know that Steven has 15 apples in total. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:
x + (x - 7) = 15
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x - 7 = 15
Adding 7 to both sides of the equation, we get:
2x = 22
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 11
So, Jake has 11 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 13 apples. Since Steven has more apples than Jill, we can say that Jill has x - 13 apples. Now, we are given that Steven has 19 apples, so we can set up the equation:
x = 19 - 13
Solving for x, we get:
x = 6
So, Jill has 6 apples."
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has fewer apples than Steven (3 vs 8).
Steven has more apples than Jill (5 vs 3).
So, we can conclude that Jake has x fewer apples than Jill.
We are also given that Steven has 8 more apples than Jill, so Steven has x + 8 apples.
Now, we need to find out how many more apples Jake has than Jill. So, we subtract the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Jill has:
x + 8 - x = 15...(1)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
Therefore, Jake has 7 more apples than Jill."
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has fewer apples than Steven (12 - 11 = 1).
Steven has more apples than Jill (11 > 4 = 7).
So, the difference between the number of apples Jill has and the number of apples Jake has is equal to the number of apples Steven has minus the number of apples Jake has plus seven. In other words:
Lebih persik yang Jill ada daripada Jake = Steven persik - Jake persik + 7
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Lebih persik yang Jill ada daripada Jake = 11 - 1 + 7 = 9
Therefore, there are nine more apples in Jill's basket than in Jake's basket."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more apples than Jill. So, we can start with Jake's number of apples as follows:  Jake = x (less than Steven) + 9 (more than Jill).  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Jake = x - 7 + 9 = 16 (since Steven has 16 apples).  Therefore, Jake has 16 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 7 apples than Steven and more than 8 apples than Jill. So, if we let S be the number of apples Steven has (which is given as 17), then we can write an equation based on this information:
Jake = S - 7
Jill = S + 8
Now, we are asked to find out how many apples Jill has. Using the second equation above, we can substitute the value of S (which we just found) into the equation:
Jill = S + 8
Substituting S = 17, we get:
Jill = 17 + 8
Jill = 25
Therefore, Jill has 25 apples."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven and more apples than Jill. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:  Jake - 9 = Steven + 16  Now let's solve for the difference between Steven and Jill:  Jill = Steven - (9 - 16)  Simplifying the expression, we get:  Jill = Steven -7  Therefore, there are 7 more apples in Steven's basket than in Jill's basket.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 6 apples than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples, then Jake has x - 6 apples.  We also know that Steven has more than 18 apples than Jill. So, if Jill has y apples, then Steven has y + 18 apples.  Now we can set up an equation based on these two statements:  x - 6 = y + 18  Solving for x (the number of apples Jake has), we get:  x = 12  Therefore, Jake has 12 apples.
Response:  We know that:  * Jake has fewer than 6 apples (Steven has more than 18).  * Jill has more apples than Jake but less than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Jill has x + 18 apples. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x < 6 and x + 18 > 87. Solving for x, we get:  x = 4. So, Jake has 4 apples fewer than Steven.
Response:  We know that:  • Jake has 16 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, Jake has x - 16 pears.  • Jill has 12 more pears than Jake. So, if Jake has x - 16 pears, Jill has x + 12 pears.  Now we can set up an equation based on these two statements:  x - 16 = (x + 12) / 2  Simplifying the equation:  x = 30  Therefore, Jill has 30 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 19 apples. Since Steven has more apples than Jake, we can say that Jake has less than or equal to x apples. Now, let's focus on the number of pears. We know that Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 12 pears. Therefore, the number of apples that Jake has is between 0 and 19, inclusive. Since Jake cannot have a negative number of apples, the minimum value of x must be 0. Hence, Jake has 0 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 3 buah epal and less than or equal to 13 buah persik. So, we can say that Jake has between 3 + x and 13 - x buah epal, where x is an unknown number. Now, let's check the information given in the question:  • Jake has 13 Kurang Buah Persik (KBP) which means he has 13 - x buah epal.  • Jake has 3 Lebih Banyak Buah Epal (LEB) which means he has 3 + x buah epal.  • Steven has 9 Buah Persik (BP) and 8 Buah Epal (BE).  From the above information, we can write two equations:  Equation 1: 13 - x = 9  Equation 2: 3 + x = 8 Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, we get: 3 + x = 9  Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 3 Therefore, Jake has 3 + x = 8 buah epal. Since x is already determined as 3, we have: Jake has 3 + 3 = 6 buah epal.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y apples, we can write an equation as follows:  Jake has x apples, Steven has y apples.  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Jake has 6 less apples than Steven, so Jake has x - 6 = y apples.  Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:  x - 6 = y. Solving for x, we get:  x = 9. Therefore, Steven has 9 more apples than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 10 more apples. Therefore, the total number of apples owned by both Jake and Steven is:
x + (x + 10) = 3x + 10
Now we are given that Jake has 3 less apples than Steven. So, we can set up an equation as follows:
3x - 3 = 3(x + 10)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x - 9 = 30
Solving for x, we find that Jake has 7 apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples owned by Jake and Steven is:
Steven - Jake = 10 - 7 = 3
So, there are 3 more apples in Steven's collection than Jake's."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x number of persimmons. Since Jill has 67 persimmons less than Steven, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 67 = 12 ( since Jill has 67 less than Steven) Now, let's solve for x :  x = 12 - 67 = -55 Therefore, Jake has 55 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 18. So, Jake must have 17 or fewer persimmons. Since Jill has more persimmons than Jake, Jill must have at least 18 - 17 = 1 persimmon more than Jake. Therefore, Jill has 19 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x persimmons where x is between 16 (the number of persimmons Steven has) and 19 (the maximum number of persimmons anyone could have). Now, we are also told that Jill has 72 persimmons less than Jake. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x - 72 = Jill's total number of persimmons. Solving for x, we get:  x = 80  So, Jake has 80 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 14 persimmons. So, there are 14 - x persimmons in Jake's collection, where x is the number of persimmons Jake has. Also, we know that Jill has 3 more persimmons than Jake. Therefore, the total number of persimmons Jill has is 14 + (3) = 17 persimmons.
"Response:  We know that Jake has more than 84 apples and less than 10 fewer bananas than Steven. So, if we let X be the number of bananas Jake has, then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
X = 84 + (10 - 13) = 84 + (-7) = 77
Therefore, Jake has 77 bananas."
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 13 apples and fewer than 17 pears than Steven. So, if we assume that Jake has x apples, then Steven must have x + 13 apples. Since Steven has 8 pears, Jake must have x - 5 pears (since he has fewer pears than Steven). Therefore, Jake has 10 epal (x - 5 = 10).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has more than x apples (since he has 18). Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Jake has 8 less apples than Steven, so Jake has x - 8 = 16 apples.
We also know that Jake has more persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has y persimmons, then Steven has less than y persimmons (since he has 11). Therefore, we can write another equation:

Steven has y - 11 = 10 persimmons.
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y):

x - 8 = 16... (1)
y - 11 = 10... (2)
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 14... (3)
y = 17... (4)
So, there are 14 more persimmons than apples in Steven's basket."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 4 apples. Since Steven has more apples than Jake, we can say that Jake has less than x apples. Now, let's find out how many more apples Steven has than Jake. We are given that Steven has 19 apples and Jake has x - 3 apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples owned by Steven and Jake is 19 - (x - 3) = 16. So, there are 16 more apples in Steven's collection than in Jake's collection. Similarly, since Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven, we can conclude that Jake has less than x - 3 persimmons, and Steven has x + 4 persimmons. Now, let's find out how many more persimmons Steven has than Jake. We are given that Steven has 15 persimmons and Jake has x - 3 persimmons. Therefore, the difference between the number of persimmons owned by Steven and Jake is 15 - (x - 3) = 12. So, there are 12 more persimmons in Steven's collection than in Jake's collection.
Response:  Ada 78 dollar in Olivia's purse initially. She spent 15 dollars at the market. So, the amount of money left with her is: $78 - $15 = $63. Therefore, Olivia has $63 left after spending at the market.
"Response:  If Olivia spends $78 at the market and she still has $33 left, then we can calculate how much money she had initially as follows:

$ Initial amount = $33 + $78 = $111
Therefore, Olivia had $111 to start with."
"Response: 
Ada $100 in Olivia's wallet initially. 
She took out $148 from an ATM. So now there is $100 + $148 = $248 left in her wallet.  Therefore, she spent $248."
"Response: 
Ada $3 in Olivia's wallet initially. 
She took $49 from an ATM later. So, the total amount of money she had after visiting the market was $49 - $3 = $46. Therefore, the difference between the amount she collected at the ATM and the amount she spent at the market is $49 - $46 = $3."
"Response: 
Ada $53 in Olivia's wallet initially. Then she took an additional $91 from the ATM. After visiting the market, there were only $14 left. So, how much money did Olivia spend at the market compared to what she collected from the ATM?
Let X be the amount of money Olivia spent at the market. Since there were only $14 left after her visit to the market, we know that $X + $91 = $65 (the total amount of money Olivia had before going to the market). Subtracting $91 from both sides gives us $X = $74. Therefore, Olivia spent $74 at the market compared to the $91 she collected from the ATM."
"Response: 
Ada $106 in Olivia's pocket initially. 
After she visited the market and spent $49 at the exhibition, there were $57 left ($106 - $49 = $57). So, Olivia spent $49 at the exhibition."
Response:  If there were $29 left after buying something at the market and Olivia had $54 in her purse initially, then we can calculate how much she spent as follows: Total amount of money Olivia had = Initial amount + Money left after buying = $54 + $29 = $83 So, Olivia spent $83.
"Response:  If Olivia spends $38 at the market and she has $128 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate how much money is left in her wallet as follows:

$ Initial amount = $128
-$ Spent amount = $38
= Remaining amount = $90

Therefore, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after spending $38 at the market."
Response:  If Dave has 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then there are 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  At first, Dave had 18 applications on his phone. After he deleted 18 of them, he was left with 5 applications. So, initially, Dave had 18 applications on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 10 applications initially and then added 11 new ones, he would have a total of 21 applications (10 + 11 = 21). Then, after deleting some of them, he has 4 remaining apps. Therefore, the number of applications that Dave deleted is equal to 21 - 4 = 17.
Response:  At first, Dave had 21 applications on his phone. Then he added 89 new apps, so now he has 100 (21 + 89) applications in total. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 applications. So, the number of additional applications that Dave added is equal to 24 - 21 = 3.
"Response: 
Dave had 15 applications on his phone initially. He added 71 new apps, so he now has 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). Then, after deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, the number of applications that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the total number of applications he had and the number of applications he had after deleting some of them: 86 - 14 = 72. Therefore, Dave deleted 72 applications from his phone."
Response:  If Dave had 16 applications and 77 fails in his phone before he deleted some of them, that means he had 16 + 77 = 93 apps and fails combined. After deleting some of them, he has 5 applications and 23 fails remaining. So, to find out how many applications he deleted, we can subtract the number of applications he has after deleting from the total number of applications he had initially:  Number of applications deleted = Total number of applications - Number of applications after deleting = 93 - 5 = 88 applications. Therefore, Dave deleted 88 applications.
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications and 17 applications after he deleted some of them. So, we can write an equation as follows: Applications = 21 - x Failures = 17 - y Where x is the number of applications Dave deleted (i.e., 17) and y is the number of failures Dave deleted (we are asked to find out). Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Applications = 21 - 17 = 4 Failures = 17 -? Solving for y, we get: y = 4 Therefore, Dave deleted 4 fails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 15 applications and 24 fails in his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, so he had 21 applications left. Next, we are told that he still has 4 fails after deleting some applications. Therefore, the number of applications Dave has is 21 + 4 = 25 more than the number of fails he has, which means he has 25 - 4 = 21 more applications than fails. So, the difference between the number of applications and fails in Dave's phone is 21.
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 fails in his phone initially. After he closed some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 fails. To find out how many more fails than applications he has, we need to subtract the number of applications from the total number of fails: Number of fails minus number of applications = 15 - 6 = 9 So, there are 9 more fails than applications that Dave left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications before adding some more, then he must have added at least 1 application to reach 18 applications in total. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  If Dave had 59 applications and 15 apps after deleting some of them, then he must have deleted 44 applications (59 - 15 = 44). So far, he has 12 applications left. To find out how many more applications he deleted, we need to subtract the number of remaining applications from the total number of applications he initially had: 44 - 12 = 32. Therefore, Dave deleted 32 applications in addition to the 15 he already had.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 13 fails initially. After he deleted some of them, he had 17 applications left and 21 fails remaining. To find out how many fails Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of fails he had after deleting from the total number of fails he had initially: Number of fails deleted = Total number of fails - Number of fails after deletion = 21 - (17 + 13) = 21 - 24 = -3 So, Dave deleted 3 fails.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has 24 applications and 9 fails in his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, so he had 5 fails and 12 applications left. To find out how many more applications than fails he has, we can subtract the number of fails from the total number of applications: Number of applications - Number of fails = 12 - 9 = 3 So, Dave has 3 more applications than fails in his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 fails in his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 24 fails and 2 applications left. To find out how many more fails than applications he had initially, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of fails: Number of fails = Total fails - Applications So, Number of fails = 24 - 11 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 more fails than applications that Dave had in his phone initially.
Response:  We know that Nell collected 242 pennies and gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, how many pennies does Nell have left?  To find out, we can subtract the number of pennies she gave away from the total number of pennies she had:  Number of pennies Nell has = Total number of pennies - Number of pennies given away  In this case, the total number of pennies Nell had was 242, and she gave away 136 pennies, so the number of pennies Nell has left is:  Number of pennies Nell has = 242 - 136 = 106 pennies.
Response:  At first, Nell gathered 301 cards and gave 154 to Jeff. So, the number of cards Nell had at first is: 301 - 154 = 147
Response:  If Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer cards now. So, if she gave 10 cards to Jeff, she would have 518 cards left (528 - 10 = 518). Now, we know that Jeff has 11 cards, so he got 10% of Nell's total cards (11 / 518 = 0.01 or 1%). Therefore, Nell gave Jeff approximately 10 cards out of her original 528 cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell collected 566 cards initially and gave some of them to Jeff. So, after giving some to Jeff, Nell had 535 cards left. Now, we need to find out how many cards Jeff has now. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards Nell gave him from his initial amount of cards. Therefore, Jeff currently has 234 - (535 - 566) = 109 cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-dollar bills. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so now she has fewer baseball cards than before. Specifically, she has 415 baseball cards left after giving some to Jeff. Since each baseball card is worth $1, we can calculate the total value of Nell's remaining baseball cards as follows: Total Value = Number of Baseball Cards x Value per Card = 415 x $1 = $415 Now, let's find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than she did initially. To do this, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she gave away from the initial number of baseball cards she had: Number of More Baseball Cards = Initial Number of Baseball Cards - Number of Baseball Cards Given Away = 309 -? = 309 - 356 = -$247 Therefore, Nell has -$247 more baseball cards than she did initially.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-dollar bills. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so she now has 404 baseball cards left.  To find out how many more ten-dollar bills Nell has than she did initially, we can subtract the number of ten-dollar bills she gave to Jeff from the total number of ten-dollar bills she had at first:  Number of ten-dollar bills Nell has now = Total number of ten-dollar bills Nell had - Number of ten-dollar bills given to Jeff  So, if Nell had 214 ten-dollar bills at first and gave 21 to Jeff, then she has 214 - 21 = 193 ten-dollar bills left.  Therefore, there are 193 more ten-dollar bills than baseball cards Nell has.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and she gave some to John. So, after giving some to John, she has 210 cards left. Now we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. According to the problem, ""Dia bagi 195 kad kepada John danlebih kepada Jeff."" This means that Nell gave 195 cards to John and more than that to Jeff. Since there are more than 195 cards left after giving some to John, it means that Nell gave all of her remaining cards (which is equal to 210 - 195 = 15) to Jeff. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is 15."
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 basketball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 55 basketball cards left and 178 baseball cards. So, the number of baseball cards Nell had initially is equal to the number of basketball cards she gave away minus the number of baseball cards she has now.  Therefore, the number of baseball cards Nell had initially is:  Number of baseball cards = 438 - 55 - 178 = 205  So, Nell had 205 baseball cards initially.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 376 baseball cards and 111 basketball cards left. To find out how many more basketball cards Nell has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of basketball cards she gave to Jeff from the total number of basketball cards she has:  Number of basketball cards Nell has = 376 - (number of basketball cards she gave to Jeff) So, if Nell gave 38 basketball cards to Jeff, then the number of basketball cards Nell has is:  Number of basketball cards Nell has = 376 - 38 = 338  Therefore, Nell has 338 more basketball cards than baseball cards.
Response:  If Paco eats 19 biscuits at first and then has only 35 biscuits left, that means he ate some of them initially. So, we need to find out how many biscuits he ate initially. We know that after he ate 19 biscuits, he had 35 - 19 = 16 biscuits left. Therefore, the number of biscuits Paco ate initially is 19.
Response:  If Paco has eaten some of his 28 biscuits and has 7 left, then we can calculate how many he ate as follows: Number of biscuits eaten = Total number of biscuits - Number of biscuits remaining = 28 - 7 = 21 So, Paco ate 21 biscuits.
Response:  Initially, Paco had 40 biscuits and he ate 2 of them. Then, he bought 37 more biscuits. So, the total number of biscuits that Paco has is:  Total = Initial + Purchased = 40 (initial) + 37 = 77 biscuits.
Response:  Initially, Paco had eaten 5 biscuits out of 25. Then he bought 3 more biscuits. So, in total, Paco had eaten 5 + 3 = 8 biscuits.
Response:  Paco initially had 13 biscuits and ate 2 of them. Then he bought 36 more biscuits. So, the total number of biscuits that Paco has now is:  Initially, Paco had 13 biscuits + The 2 biscuits he ate = 15 biscuits.  He then bought additional 36 biscuits, so the total number of biscuits that Paco has now is: 15 (initial) + 36 = 51 biscuits. Therefore, the answer to the question is 51.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 5 biscuits and given 13 to his friend, then he must have had 40 - 5 = 35 biscuits left initially. So, the number of biscuits that Paco has is 35.
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 biscuits and given 13 to his friend. So, he still has how many biscuits left?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of biscuits he gave away (13) from the total number of biscuits he had (17). Therefore, the answer is:  Paco has 4 more biscuits than he gave away to his friend.
Response:  Paco consumed 12 biscuits and gave 21 to his friend. So, he had 9 (12 - 21) biscuits left. Now, let's calculate how many more biscuits he gave to his friend than he consumed:  Number of biscuits given to friend = Number of biscuits consumed + Number of biscuits given to friend = 9 + 21 = 30 Therefore, Paco gave 30 more biscuits to his friend than he consumed.
Response:  If Paco had 22 biskuts of manis and he ate 15 of them, then he has 22 - 15 = 7 remaining manis biskuts. Similarly, if he had 75 biskuts of masin and he ate 54 of them, then he has 75 - 54 = 21 remaining masin biskuts. So, the number of manis biskuts that Paco has is 7.
Response:  If Paco eats 9 biscuits that are sweet and 6 biscuits that are salty, then he has a total of 15 biscuits (9 + 6).  If he eats 36 more biscuits that are sweet, then he has a total of 51 biscuits (15 + 36).  Finally, if he eats 3 more biscuits that are salty, then he has a total of 54 biscuits (51 + 3). Therefore, the number of salted biscuits that Paco has is 54.
Response:  If Paco has 37 biscuits of chocolate and 11 biscuits of cookies, then he eats 5 biscuits of chocolate and 2 biscuits of cookies. So, the number of chocolate biscuits left is 37 - 5 = 32, and the number of cookie biscuits left is 11 - 2 = 9. Therefore, the ratio of chocolate to cookie biscuits that Paco ate is 32 : 9 or 4 : 1.
Response:  If Paco eats 8 biscuits of chocolate and 6 biscuits of cheese, then he has eaten a total of 8 + 6 = 14 biscuits.  Now, if he eats 20 biscuits of chocolate and 34 biscuits of cheese, then he has eaten a total of 20 + 34 = 54 biscuits. So, the number of cheese biscuits that Paco has eaten is 54 - 14 = 40 biscuits. Therefore, Paco has eaten 40 cheese biscuits for every 14 chocolate biscuits he ate.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 36 biscuits and he had 37 cookies initially, then we can say that after eating all those biscuits, Paco has consumed (37 - 36) = 1 cookie less than what he had initially. So, the number of cookies left with Paco is 37 - 1 = 36 cookies.
Response:  If Paco has 36 biscuits and he gives 14 to his friends, then he has 22 (36 - 14) biscuits left for himself. So, the number of biscuits that Paco has is 22.
Response:  Paco has 41 biscuits and he gives 9 to his friend. So, he has 32 biscuits left (41 - 9 = 32). Now, he eats 18 biscuits. So, the number of biscuits he has left is 32 - 18 = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 23 biscuits and given away 30 biscuits to his friends, then he must have had 6 - 30 = -24 biscuits left over for himself. So, the number of biscuits that Paco gave away is equal to the number of biscuits he ate minus the number of biscuits he kept for himself, which is -24. Therefore, the answer is -24.
Response:  If Paco has 97 machine guns and 34 candy, he eats 15 candies and 56 machine guns. So, how many candies does Paco have left? We know that after eating 15 candies, Paco had 34 - 15 = 19 candies left. Therefore, Paco has 19 candies left.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 26 biscuits in total and he has eaten 14 biscuits that are sweet, then he must have left 12 biscuits (26 - 14 = 12). So, there are 12 sweet biscuits left for Paco to eat.
Response:  If Paco has 39 biskut manis and 6 biskut masin, then he has a total of 45 biskuts (39 + 6).  If he eats 23 biskut masin, then he has 22 biskuts left (45 - 23).  And if he also eats 32 biskut manis, then he has 10 biskuts left (22 - 32). So, the number of biskuts Manis that Paco eats is 32 / 2 = 16. Therefore, the ratio of Biskuts Manis to Biskuts Masin that Paco eats is 16 : 2 or 8 : 1.
Response:  If Paco eats 40 biscuits that are sweet and 25 biscuits that are salty, then he has eaten in total 65 biscuits (40 + 25).  If he eats 28 biscuits that are salty and 15 biscuits that are sweet, then he has eaten in total 43 biscuits (28 + 15). So, the number of salted biscuits that Paco ate is 65 - 43 = 22 more than the number of sweet biscuits he ate. Therefore, the ratio of salted to sweet biscuits that Paco ate is 22/15 = 1.5.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $7. Then she spent some money and had $5 left. So, the amount of money that Gwen spent is equal to the difference between the initial amount ($7) and the remaining amount after spending ($5). Therefore, the answer is $2.
Response:  If Gwen received $ for the day and spent $8, then she has $6 left. So, the amount of money that Gwen received is $ Substitution: Let x = the amount of money that Gwen received for the day. Now we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:  We know that Gwen spent $8, so we can subtract this from the amount of money she received to find out how much she had left:  Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen received for the day is $
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $2 from her mother and then she got additional $4 from her father, so in total she has $6 ($2 + $4). If she spends $3, then the amount left with her is $6 - $3 = $3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. So far, she has received a total of $13 ($8 + $5).  Next, we are told that Gwen spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen received from her mother is equal to the amount she received from her father minus the amount she spent ($13 - $4 = $9).  Hence, Gwen received $9 from her mother compared to $5 from her father.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6).  If she spends $4, then she will have $5 left ($9 - $4). So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her father is $5 more than the amount she received from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. So far, she has received a total of $12 ($5 + $7). Then, she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money Gwen received from her mother is $7 - $4 = $3 more than the amount she received from her father. In other words, Gwen received $3 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $5 from her father and then she got additional $2 from her mother, so in total she received $7 (5 + 2). Now, if she spends $6, it means that she has $1 left with her ($7 - $6 = $1). So, the amount of money Gwen received from her father is more than the amount she received from her mother.
Response:  At first, Josh had 9 marbles in his collection. Then he lost some marbles. So, let's say he lost x marbles. Now, we know that Josh has 4 marbles left in his collection. To find out how many marbles Josh had initially, we can use the equation: Number of marbles Josh had = Total number of marbles - Number of marbles he lost. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of marbles Josh had = 9 - x. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, Josh had 9 marbles at first and then lost 5 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 30 marbles in his collection and he lost 21 of them, then he has 9 marbles left (30 - 21 = 9). So, now Josh has 9 marbles in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 marbles, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left. Finally, he got 5 new marbles, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 marbles in total. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  If Josh has 4 marbles in his collection and he lost 16 marbles, then he had 4 + 16 = 20 marbles initially. Now, he got 8 new marbles, so he has 20 + 8 = 28 marbles now. Therefore, he is left with 28 - 4 = 24 marbles less than what he initially had.
Response:  If Josh has 7 marbles in his collection and he loses 8 of them, then he has 7 - 8 = 9 marbles left. But then he gets 10 new marbles, so now he has 9 + 10 = 19 marbles in total. Therefore, the number of marbles that Josh gained is 19 - 7 = 12 marbles.
Response:  At first, Josh had 21 marbles in his collection. Then he met 7 marbles. So, now Josh has 21 + 7 = 28 marbles.
Response:  At first, Josh had 20 marbles in his collection. Then he gave 2 marbles to Jack. So now, Josh has 18 marbles left (20 - 2 = 18). Therefore, Josh currently has 18 marbles in his collection.
Response:  We know that Josh had 22 marbles initially and then Jack gave him 20 more marbles. So, in total, Josh now has 22 + 20 = 42 marbles.
Response:  Before Josh got 11 more marbles, he had 19 marbles in total. So, after getting 11 more marbles, the number of marbles he has now is:  19 + 11 = 30 marbles. Therefore, Josh currently has 30 marbles.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 5 marbles. So, he has 22 - 5 = 17 marbles left. Therefore, Josh currently has 17 marbles in his collection.
Response:  If Josh has 15 marbles initially and meets 9 more later, then he has a total of 15 + 9 = 24 marbles. However, when he loses 23 marbles, he is left with 24 - 23 = 1 marble. So, there are only 1 marble less than the number of marbles he had initially. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Josh has 3 marbles in his collection initially and then he lost 5 of them. So, the number of marbles left with him is 3 - 5 = -2 marbles. Now we are asked how many more marbles Josh found than he lost. Therefore, the answer is +2 marbles.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 4 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco alone picked x pounds of strawberries, then he would have contributed to only 4/x pounds of the total weight of strawberries they collected. Since Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, we can set up the equation: 4/x = 19. Solving for x, we get:  x = 76. Therefore, Marco's father must have picked 76 - 4 = 72 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  The total weight of all strawberries is given as 35 pounds (paun).  Since Marco has 13 pounds of strawberries, his share is 13/35 = 0.37 pounds (paun).  Now we need to find out how much more his father's strawberries are than Marco's. So, we subtract Marco's weight from the total weight: 35 - 0.37 = 34.63 pounds (paun). Therefore, Marco's father's strawberries are 34.63 pounds more than Marco's.
Response:  We know that the total weight of strawberries collected by Marco and his father is 20 pounds (paun). The weight of the strawberries collected by Marco alone is 3 pounds less than the total weight, which means that the weight of the strawberries collected by his father is 20 - 3 = 17 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the strawberries collected by Marco is 17 / 2 = 8.5 pounds.
Response:  The weight of the strawberries that Marco picked is 8 pounds (paun).  The weight of the strawberry jam that he made is 32 pounds (paun), which means it takes 4 times as much strawberries to make the same amount of jam. So, if Marco picked 8 pounds of strawberries, then he must have used 32 pounds of strawberries to make the jam. Therefore, the total weight of strawberries Marco and his father picked is 8 + 32 = 40 pounds (paun).
Response:  If Marco and his father together picked 24 pounds of strawberries, then the total weight of all the strawberries they collected is 24 pounds. Since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries during the journey back home, the remaining weight of strawberries he has now is 3 pounds. So, the weight of strawberries that Marco's father had is 24 - 9 = 15 pounds.
"Response: 
Marco and his father together picked 36 pounds of strawberries. Then, during their journey back home, Marco's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So, the total weight of the strawberries that Marco has now is 12 pounds (36 - 8 = 12). Therefore, the weight of the strawberries that Marco's father currently has is 36 - 12 = 24 pounds."
"Response: 
Marco and his father together picked 22 pounds of strawberries in their journey. Then, when Marco's father met him again, he had an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, the total weight of strawberries that Marco's father now has is: 22 + 30 = 52 pounds."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have picked 37 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco alone has picked 15 pounds, then his father must have picked how much more?  Therefore, the weight of strawberries picked by Marco's father is 37 - 15 = 22 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have 17 pounds of strawberries (Marco has 30 pounds minus what he and his father have together). So, if they have 17 pounds together, then Marco must have x pounds of strawberries. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: 30 - (x + 17) = 0  Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us: -13 = x Solving for x, we get: x = 50 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's father must have 50 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  The total weight of strawberries that Marco and his father picked is given as 26 pounds (paun). Since Marco alone weighed 10 pounds, then the weight of strawberries he picked is also 10 pounds. Therefore, the weight of strawberries his father picked is 26 - 10 = 16 pounds. So, the difference in weight between the strawberries his father picked and those he picked is 16 - 10 = 6 pounds.
Response:  The total weight of Marco and his father picking strawberries is 30 pounds (paun). Since Marco alone weighs 11 pounds, then the weight of his father must be 2 times that of Marco, or 2 x 11 = 22 pounds. So, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 30 - (11 + 22) = 6 pounds.
Response:  Before boarding the bus, there were 2 children (Dua) who got on the bus. Then, 5 more children got on the bus at the bus stop. So, in total, there are 7 children inside the bus now (2 + 5 = 7).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 children in total who want to board the bus. Then, we are told that 38 more children got on the bus after waiting at the bus stop. So, the total number of children on the bus now is: 26 + 38 = 64 children. Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus currently.
Response:  At first, there were some children who rode the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus at the stop. Finally, there were 41 children altogether in the bus. So, the number of children who rode the bus before reaching the stop is:  Number of children who rode the bus = Total number of children - Number of children who got on at the stop  = 41 - 2  = 39
Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the rest stop. However, we don't know how many children got off. So, let's assume that x number of children got off. Now, we have 21 children left inside the bus. Therefore, the total number of children who got off is equal to 43 - 21 = 22. Hence, 22 children got off from the bus at the rest stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the rest stop. So, the number of children left inside the bus was 18. To find out how many more children were inside the bus before the rest stop, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. Therefore, the answer is: 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children who boarded the bus. Then, 10 of them got off the bus while some others got on it. So, the total number of children inside the bus after this process is: 21 - 10 = 11. Finally, there are 16 children inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus at the stop is: 16 - 11 = 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 children who boarded the bus initially. Then, 63 children got off the bus while some others got on. Finally, there were 14 children inside the bus. To find out how many children got on the bus compared to those who got off, we can use the following equation: Number of children who got on = Number of children who got off + Initial number of children on the bus (5) So, in this case, the number of children who got on the bus is equal to 63 - 5 + 5 = 53 children. Therefore, there were 53 children who got on the bus compared to those who got off.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 children who boarded the bus initially. Then, 68 children got off the bus while some others got on it. So, the total number of children on the bus afterward is: 36 + (68 - x), where x is the number of children who got on the bus. Since there were 12 children inside the bus initially, we can set up the equation as follows: 36 + (68 - x) = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 56. Therefore, there were 56 children who got on the bus afterward, and 68 children got off the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 40 children who got off the bus at the rest stop. Then, 2 more children entered the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus now is 40 + 2 = 42. Finally, 40 children got off the bus at the rest stop, leaving only 2 children inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the rest stop is 42 - 40 = 2.
Response:  At first, there were 82 children who got off the bus (total number of children = 82). Then, 28 more children boarded the bus (additional number of children = 28). So, the total number of children on the bus now is: Total number of children on the bus = 82 + 28 = 110 children. Finally, 30 new children entered the bus, so the total number of children on the bus now is: Total number of children on the bus = 110 + 30 = 140 children. Therefore, there are 70 fewer children who got off the bus than those who entered the bus (answer = 70).
Response:  At first, there were 23 children who boarded the bus. Then, 24 children got off the bus while 8 new children entered it. So, how many children are left on the bus now? To find out, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who boarded the bus:  Number of children remaining on the bus = Total number of children who boarded the bus - Number of children who got off  In this case, the total number of children who boarded the bus was 23, and 24 children got off, so the number of children remaining on the bus is:  Number of children remaining on the bus = 23 - 24 = -1  Therefore, there is one child less than the original number of children who boarded the bus.
Response:  If Tukang Roti makes 133 pieces of bread and sells 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now, let's assume that Baker also made 133 pieces of bread, but sold only 51 of them. So, Baker has 82 remaining bread as well (133 - 51 = 82). Therefore, the number of bread pieces made by Baker is equal to the number of bread pieces left by Tukang Roti, which is 82.
Response:  If the baker has 54 cookies and sells some of them, then he will have fewer cookies left. We can assume that he sold half of his cookies (since it is not specified how many he sold). So, after selling half of his cookies, he will have 54 / 2 = 27 cookies left. Therefore, the number of cookies sold by the baker is 27 - 13 = 14 cookies.
Response:  We know that Tukang Roti has sold 145 of his total 160 rotis (since he still has 72 left). So, to find out how many rotis were made by Baker, we can divide the number of rotis sold by the total number of rotis made:  Number of rotis made by Baker = Number of rotis sold / Total number of rotis made  Number of rotis sold = 145 / 160  Number of rotis made by Baker = 145 / 160 x 100%  Number of rotis made by Baker = 90  Therefore, there are 90 rotis made by Baker.
Response:  Tukang Roti has sold 155 pieces of bread to his friend. If his friend bought 140 pieces from him, then there are 15 - (140 / 155) = 29 pieces of bread left with the baker.
Response:  Tukang Roti has 121 pieces of bread and sells 105 of them. This means he still has 16 pieces of bread left (121 - 105 = 16). Then, he buys 170 new pieces of bread. So, now he has 16 + 170 = 186 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  If Tukang Roti sold 13 cakes and bought 154 new ones, then he has 154 - 13 = 141 extra cakes that he did not sell. So, the number of cakes that Baker bought is equal to the number of cakes that he did not sell, which is 141. Therefore, Baker bought 141 cakes more than what she sold.
Response:  The baker sold 170 cookies and bought 31 new ones. So, the number of cookies he sold is greater than the number of cookies he bought. Therefore, we can say that the number of cookies the baker sold = 170 - 31 = 139 cookies.
Response:  Tukang roti first made 110 pieces of bread and sold 75 of them. Then he made additional 76 pieces of bread. So, the total number of bread that Tukang roti has is: Total = Sold + Newly Made = 75 + 76 = 151 pieces of bread. Therefore, there are 151 pieces of bread left in the baker.
Response:  The baker made 144 cookies and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 cookies. So, in total, the baker made 255 cookies (144 + 111). Therefore, there are 255 - 71 = 184 more cookies that the baker made than he sold.
Response:  If pembakar makes 149 keks and 91 pastries, then he has a total of 230 items (149 + 91 = 230).  If he sells 10 keks and 90 pastries, then he is left with 220 items (230 - 10 - 90 = 220). Therefore, there are still 220 keks remaining after he sells 10 keks and 90 pastries.
Response:  If pembakar makes 7 keks and 148 pastries, then he has a total of 7 + 148 = 155 items.  If he sells 15 keks and 103 pastries, then he is left with 7 + 148 - 15 - 103 = 26 pastries. Therefore, there are 26 pastries remaining after he sells his goods.
Response:  Tukang roti has made 126 keks and 48 pastries. If he sells 115 keks and 81 pastries, then we can calculate how many more keks than pastries he sold as follows: Number of keks sold = 115 Total number of keks produced - Number of keks sold = 126 - 115 = 11 Number of pastries sold = 81 Total number of pastries produced - Number of pastries sold = 48 - 81 = -33 Therefore, there are 33 more keks than pastries that were sold by the baker.
Response:  If pembakar makes 19 keks and 131 pastries, then he has a total of 150 items (keks + pastries).  If he sells 70 keks and 88 pastries, then he has sold a total of 158 items (70 keks + 88 pastries). So, there are 158 - 150 = 8 more pastries than keks that were made by the baker.
Response:  Tukang Roti made 157 keks and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 keks and 147 pastries, then we can calculate how many more keks were sold than pastries as follows: Number of keks sold = Total number of keks produced - Number of keks sold = 157 - 158 = -1 So, there were 1 fewer kek sold than pastries. Therefore, the answer is -1.
Response:  Tukang roti has made 54 keks and 143 pastries. If he sells 68 keks and 92 pastries, then we can calculate how many more pastries he sold than keks as follows: Number of pastries sold = 92 - 68 = 24 more pastries were sold than keks. Therefore, tukang roti sold 24 more pastries than keks.
Response:  If Tukang Roti sells 44 keks initially and then makes 48 more, the total number of keks he has is: Total Number of Keks = Initially sold + Newly made = 44 + 48 = 92 keks. So, there are still 92 keks left after making the additional 48 keks.
Response:  If Tukang Roti sells 8 pieces of bread at first and then makes 40 more pieces, we can calculate how many pieces he has made in total as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of pieces sold initially + Number of additional pieces made = 8 + 40 = 48 pieces So, Baker has made 48 pieces of bread in total.
"Response:  If Kawan bought 137 rotis from him and he made 169 keks to start with, then we can calculate how many keks are left as follows: Number of keks remaining = Total number of keks made - Number of rotis bought x Number of keks per rot i (Note that this is just an assumption; it may not be accurate depending on how much each baker makes.) So, in this case, the number of keks remaining would be: Number of keks remaining = 169 - (137 x 4) = 169 - 552 = -383 Therefore, there are -383 keks left."
Response:  Tukang roti has 173 cookies and he sells 86 of them. So, how many cookies are left with him?  We can calculate this as follows: Total number of cookies = Number of cookies bought + Number of cookies sold - Number of cookies remaining = 103 + 86 - x = 173 - 86 = 87 Cookies Therefore, there are 87 cookies left with the baker after selling 86 cookies.
Response:  If Tukang Roti bought 99 cakes and sold 89 cakes, then he has 99 - 89 = 10 extra cakes left with him.  Therefore, Baker bought more cakes than she sold.
Response:  If Tukang Roti bought 8 packs of bread and sold 145 packs, we can calculate how many packs he sold based on the number of packs he bought as follows: Number of packs sold = Number of packs bought x Number of packs sold / Number of packs bought So in this case, if Tukang Roti bought 8 packs of bread and sold 145 packs, then the number of packs he sold is: Number of packs sold = 8 x 145/8 = 175 packs Therefore, Baker sold 175 packs more than the number of packs he bought.
Response:  Firstly, Tukang Roti made 62 pieces of kek and then he made additional 87 pieces (149 - 62 = 87). So, the total number of keks that Tukang Roti made is 62 + 87 = 150. Then, he sold 144 pieces of kek. Therefore, there are 150 - 144 = 6 keks left with Tukang Roti.
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""tukang roti buat 81 kek."" This means that Baker made 81 cookies. Then comes the second part of the question ""Kemudian dia buat 92 lagi kek."" This means that after making the initial 81 cookies, Baker made additional 92 cookies. Finally, we are asked to find out how many more cookies Baker made than he sold. So, let's subtract the number of cookies sold (46) from the total number of cookies made (92): 92 - 46 = 46 Therefore, Baker made 46 more cookies than he sold."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tukang Roti has made 61 patties and 167 cakes in total. If he sells 108 cakes, then the number of cakes left is:  Number of cakes sold = 108 Cakes remaining = Total cakes - Sold cakes = 167 - 108 = 59 cakes. Therefore, there are 59 cakes left after Tukang Roti sells 108 cakes.
Response:  If Tukang Roti makes 56 pancakes and 124 cakes, then he has a total of 180 items (pastries + cakes).  If he sells 104 cakes, that means he still has 76 items left (180 - 104 = 76). So, there are 76 pastries and cakes remaining after Tukang Roti sold 104 cakes.
Response:  If Tukang Roti makes 52 pasteris and 84 keke, then he has a total of 136 pieces (52 + 84).  If he sells 102 keks and 94 pastries, then he will have 102 - 94 = 7 more keks than pastries left. So, there are 7 more keks than pastries left after selling them.
Response:  Tukang roti has made 134 pasteris and 11 keke. If he sells 140 cakes and 92 pasteris, how many more pasteris does he sell than cakes?  To find out, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of pasteris made: 134 - 140 = -7 Pastries. So, tukang roti sells 7 fewer pasteris than the number of cakes he sells.
Response:  If Pembakar makes 14 cakes and 153 pastries, then he has a total of 167 items (14 cakes + 153 pastries).  If he sells 8 cakes and 97 cakes, then he has left with 167 - 8 = 159 items.  Now, if we compare this to the number of cakes sold by Baker, which is 8, then we can see that Pembakar has more than 8 cakes. In fact, he has 159 - 8 = 151 more cakes than Baker. Therefore, the answer is 151.
Response:  Tukang Roti made 43 keks and 114 pastries. If he sold 154 keks and 78 keks, then we can calculate how many more keks were sold than pastries as follows: Number of keks sold = Total number of keks sold - Number of keks sold by Baker Number of keks sold = 154 + 78 - x Where x is the number of keks sold by Baker. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of keks sold = 232 - x Now, we need to find out how many more keks were sold than pastries. To do this, we subtract the number of pastries sold (114) from the total number of keks sold: Number of keks sold minus Number of pastries sold = 232 - 114 = 118 Therefore, there were 118 more keks sold than pastries.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she needs to have 140 remaining games, then we can calculate how many more games she needs as follows: Number of games needed = Total number of games - Current number of games  Number of games needed = 140 - 22 = 118 Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to have 140 remaining games.
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she gives away 64 of them, then she will have 42 remaining (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Kelly had 91 games at first and then gave away 92 more games, that means she has 91 + 92 = 183 games now. So, there are 183 games in total.
Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, that means she has a total of 90 games. To have 12 Nintendo games left, we need to subtract 20 (the number of Nintendo games she already has) from 90 (the total number of games she has). So, Kelly needs to give away 78 games (90 - 20 = 78).
Response:  If Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to have 31 Sony games left, we can calculate how many Sony games she needs to give away as follows: Number of Sony games needed = Total number of Sony games - Desired number of Sony games to keep (31) Total number of Sony games = 132 (number of Sony games Kelly has) - 31 (desired number of Sony games to keep) = 101 Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 31 Sony games to have 31 remaining.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she meets 31 more games of Nintendo, then the total number of games is: 80 + 31 = 111 games. So, Kelly needs to give 11 - 6 = 5 more games for her to have 6 additional games.
Response:  We know that Randy used 52 blocks to build his tower. So initially, he had 52 - 38 = 14 blocks left. Therefore, Randy had 14 blocks at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If there are still 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can say that Randy used x number of blocks to build the tower. Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies the given condition.  So, let's write an equation based on the information provided in the question: Number of blocks available = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower  In this case, the total number of blocks is 97, and the number of blocks used for the tower is 72, so we can write the equation as follows:  Number of blocks available = 97 - 72  Number of blocks available = 25  Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total. He uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, how many blocks are left after he builds these structures?  To find out, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the tower and the house from the total number of blocks available.  Therefore, the remaining number of blocks is: 79 - (14 + 11) = 54 blocks.
Response:  If Randy has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower, then he has 58 - 27 = 31 blocks left.  Now, if he uses 53 of these remaining blocks to build a house, then he has 31 - 53 = -20 blocks left (negative because we can't have negative blocks). So, Randy did not use any blocks to build the house. Therefore, the number of blocks used to build the tower is 27, and the number of blocks used to build the house is 0.
Response:  If Randy has 37 blocks and he uses 33 blocks to build a tower, then he has 4 blocks left over (37 - 33 = 4). Now, if he uses 13 blocks to build a house, how many blocks does he have left? So, the number of blocks used for building a tower is equal to the number of blocks left after building the house. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Randy uses 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house, then we can say that he used more blocks for building the house than for building the tower. So, if we divide the number of blocks used for building the house (82) by the number of blocks used for building the tower (79), we get:  Number of blocks used for building the house = 82 / 79 = 10  Therefore, Randy used 10 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
"Response:  If Randy uses 36 blocks to build a tower and he has 59 blocks in total, then we can find out how many blocks are left over as follows:

Number of blocks used = Number of blocks available = 36 blocks x 59 blocks = 2140 blocks
So there are 2140 - 36 = 2084 blocks left over after building the tower."
Response:  If Randy has 95 blocks and uses 20 of them to build a house, then he has 75 blocks left (95 - 20 = 75).  If he uses 50 blocks to build a tower, then he has 25 blocks left (75 - 50 = 25). So, Randy used more blocks to build the tower than he did for the house. Therefore, the number of blocks Randy used to build the tower is greater than the number of blocks he used to build the house.
Response:  If Randy has 90 blocks and uses 89 of them to build a house, then he has 1 block left over.  If he uses 63 blocks to build a tower, then he has 27 blocks left over (90 - 89 = 1). So, for every 1 block used to build the tower, Randy has 27/1 = 27 blocks left over to build the house. Therefore, Randy uses 27 times as many blocks to build the house as he does to build the tower.
Response:  If Ada has read 20 books in Siri's School for Fools, then she must have read at least 5 books before that, since each book takes her 4 days to finish reading. So, the number of books Ada has read is: 5 + 20 = 25 books.
Response:  We know that Ada has read 13 books and there are 8 more books left to be read in the school library. So, the total number of books in the school library is:  13 + 8 = 21 books. Therefore, there are 21 books in the school library.
Response:  If Siri has read 22 books and watched 10 movies in Sekolah Gila that is foolish, then we can assume that she has not read or watched any other books or movies outside of Sekolah Gila. Therefore, if she reads 12 more books and watches 56 more movies, it means that she has now read 34 books (22 + 12) and watched 78 movies (10 + 56). So, to find out how many more books and movies Siri needs to read/watch, we subtract the number of books and movies she has already read/watched from the total number of books and movies available: 34 - 22 = 12 books, and 78 - 10 = 68 movies. Hence, Siri still needs to read 12 more books and watch 68 more movies.
Response:  If Siri has read 4 books and watched 17 movies in her school, that means she has consumed a total of 21 pieces of media (books + movies).  If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still need to consume an additional 2 pieces of media (books or movies) before reaching Siri's level of consumption. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  If Ada read 16 books in the ""Gila School"" and watched 14 movies, then she has a total of 16 + 14 = 30 items in her collection.  Now, if we add the number of books to the number of movies, we get 30 + 13 = 43 items in total. Therefore, there are 43 more books than movies in Ada's collection."
Response:  If Ada reads 8 books in the school library that are stupid, then she has read a total of 8 books.  If she watches 10 movies, it means she has watched a total of 10 movies.  So, the number of movies she has watched is equal to the number of books she has read plus 10 (the number of movies she watched). Therefore, the answer is 8 + 10 = 18 movies.
Response:  If Ada read 10 books and watched 11 movies in School of Stupidity, that means she read 10/1 = 10 books and watched 11/1 = 11 movies.  So, if she reads 13 books and watches 12 movies after that, then she has read 13 - 10 = 3 more books than before and watched 12 - 11 = 1 more movie than before. Therefore, the number of books she read is 3 and the number of movies she watched is 1.
Response:  If Ada reads 11 books in Sekolah Gila yang Bodoh, then she has read a total of 11 books.  If she watches 17 movies in Sekolah Gila yang Bodoh, then she has watched a total of 17 movies.  To find out how many movies Ada has watched after reading 7 books, we need to subtract the number of books she has read from the total number of movies she has watched. So, the answer is:  Movies watched = Total movies - Number of books read = 17 - 7 = 10 movies.
Response:  If you have read 8 books from 'Siri's School of Stupidity', and there are 14 books in total in that series, then we can calculate the number of remaining books as follows:  Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 books - 8 books = 6 books So, there are 6 more books left to be read in the series.
Response:  If Ada has read 62 books in total (including 19 from Siri's School), then she still needs to read 43 books (62 - 19 = 43).  Similarly, if she has watched 34 movies, then she still needs to watch 76 movies (34 + 19 = 76). Therefore, the answer is 43 for books and 76 for movies.
Response:  If Ada reads 8 books in school and watches 21 movies, that means she has read 8/21 = 0.36 x 7 = 2.52 books left to read. Similarly, if she has watched 4 movies so far, there are 21 - 4 = 17 movies left for her to watch.
Response:  If you read 11 books from the library, that means you have 11 books in your possession.  Now, let's assume that each book has an average of 200 pages (this is just an estimate). So, if you read 11 books, you would have read a total of 2200 pages (11 x 200 = 2200).  As for the movies, if you watched 40 movies, that means you have watched a total of 80 hours of movie time (40 x 60 minutes/movie = 80 hours).  Therefore, the difference between the number of books you read and the number of movies you watched is 80 - 2200 = -1920 hours.  In other words, you spent more time watching movies than reading books.
Response:  If you read 13 books from the library, that means you have watched 13 x 6 = 78 movies. Since there are 11 books in the school's collection, you have watched 78 - 11 = 67 movies more than the number of books you read. Therefore, the answer is 67 movies.
Response:  If Siri has read 10 books and watched 6 movies in School of Stupidity, that means she has spent 10 + 6 = 16 hours watching or reading those media.  Now, if we assume that each movie takes approximately 2 hours to watch (this is just an estimate), then the total time spent watching movies would be 6 x 2 = 12 hours. Similarly, if each book takes approximately 3 hours to read (again, this is just an estimate), then the total time spent reading books would be 10 x 3 = 30 hours. Therefore, if Siri has read 14 books and watched 19 movies, she has spent a total of 30 + 12 = 42 hours consuming these media.
Response:  If Siri has read 8 books and watched 5 movies in School of Stupidity, that means she has consumed a total of 8 + 5 = 13 pieces of media.  If you have read 19 books and watched 16 movies outside of school, that means you have consumed a total of 19 + 16 = 35 pieces of media. So, the difference between the number of media consumed inside and outside of school is 35 - 13 = 22 pieces of media.
Response:  If Dave has won 7 tickets and he uses one ticket to buy a game, then he will have 6 remaining tickets. Now, if he wants to buy another game using his remaining tickets, he can use up to 5 tickets because he only has 6 remaining tickets. So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy the second game is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Dave has already won 12 tickets and he is using them to buy a toy. So, there are 14 - 12 = 2 tickets left with him. Therefore, Dave has won 2 tickets in total.
Response:  If Dave has won 18 tickets and he uses 5 of them to buy a toy, then he has 13 remaining tickets.  If he uses 11 more tickets to buy clothes, that means he has spent all his remaining tickets (13) plus 11 = 24 tickets. So, Dave now has 24 tickets left.
Response:  If Dave has won 19 tickets and he uses 12 of them to buy some games, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets.  Now, if he uses 7 more tickets to buy some clothes, that means he has used up all his remaining tickets (7). So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy clothes is equal to the total number of tickets he had left after buying games, which is 7.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and he uses 8 of them to buy some toys, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5).  Now, if he wants to buy some clothes with his remaining 5 tickets, he will use all of them up (5 = 0). So, in total, Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys and 5 tickets to buy clothes, which means he has 0 tickets left.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, then he has a total of 16 tickets left (14 + 2 = 16).  If he uses 10 tickets to buy some games, then he will have 6 tickets left (16 - 10 = 6).
Response:  We know that Haley has 14 plants in her backyard and after the storm (taufan), 9 of them died. To find out how many plants survived, we need to divide the number of surviving plants by the total number of plants. So, the ratio of surviving plants to dead plants is:  Number of surviving plants = Total number of plants - Number of dead plants  In this case, the total number of plants was 14, and 9 of them died, so the number of surviving plants is:  Number of surviving plants = 14 - 9 = 5  Therefore, there were 5 surviving plants in Haley's backyard after the storm.
Response:  We know that Haley has 13 plants in her backyard and after the storm, 6 of them died. So, we need to find out how many plants survived the storm. To do this, we can use the ratio of surviving plants to total number of plants. Ratio = Surviving plants / Total number of plants = 7 (surviving) / 13 (total) = 0.54 (or 54%)  Therefore, 54% of Haley's plants survived the storm.
Response:  If Haley has 20 plants in her backyard and after the storm, 4 of them are left, then we can calculate the number of dead plants as follows: Number of dead plants = Total number of plants - Number of surviving plants = 20 - 4 = 16 So, there were 16 dead plants in Haley's backyard after the storm.
Response:  If Haley has grown some plants behind her house after the storm that killed 5 people, and she allowed them to grow without any restrictions, then we can assume that the number of plants she grew is proportional to the time since the storm.  Therefore, if it took 3 years for Haley to grow 12 plants from the original 5, then the rate at which she grows plants is 2 per year (12/3 = 4).  So, in total, Haley will have grown 48 plants over the course of 5 years (4 x 5 = 20).
Response:  At first, Haley had 9 plants behind her house after the storm killed 4 of them. Then she planted 5 more plants. So, in total, Haley has 14 plants (9 + 5).
Response:  If two trees behind Haley's house died due to Tufan, and she had initially planted 12 trees there, then we can calculate how many trees are left as follows: Total number of trees = Initial number of trees x (Number of surviving trees / Number of dead trees) Total number of trees = 12 x (2/3) = 8 So, there are 8 trees left after the storm.
Response:  If there were initially 3 pokok behind Haley's house that survived the tornado and now 13 have died, then the number of pokok that died is 10 (13 - 3).
Response:  If initially there were 11 healthy trees behind Haley's house that survived the tornado, and 5 of them died as a result of the storm, then the number of surviving trees would be 11 - 5 = 6. So, there are 6 healthy trees left behind Haley's house after the tornado.
Response:  If they harvest 66 beg every day and each beg contains 28 jeruk, then we can calculate how many jeruk they harvest daily as follows:  Number of jeruk = Total number of beg x Number of jeruk in each beg  Therefore, the total number of jeruk harvested daily is:  Number of jeruk = 66 beg x 28 jeruk/beg = 1792 jeruk/day
Response:  If it takes 8 beg sehari to harvest 1 jeruk, then it will take x beg sehari to harvest 24 beg oren (which is equal to 3 jeruks). So we can set up an equation as follows:  x = 8 / 3 = 2.67 days. Therefore, it will take approximately 2.67 days to harvest 24 beg oren of jeruk.
Response:  If they harvest 56 beg oren each day for 4 days, then the total number of beg oren they will have after 4 days is:  Total = Daily amount x Number of days = 56 x 4 = 224 beg oren. Therefore, the correct answer is 224 beg oren.
Response:  If they harvest 38 begs per day and each beg contains 42 orens, then the total number of orens collected in one day is:  Number of begs = 38  x 42 orens/beg = 1576 orens/day Now, let's calculate how many orens they will have after 49 days: Total number of orens after 49 days = Daily collection x Number of days = 1576 orens/day x 49 days = 76,080 orens So, after 49 days, they will have approximately 76,080 orens.
Response:  If they harvest 66 begs every day and each beg contains 25 jeruk, then the total number of jeruk collected in one day is:  Number of jeruk = Total number of begs x Number of jeruk in each beg  Therefore, the total number of jeruk collected in one day is:  Number of jeruk = 66 x 25 = 1650 jeruk  Now, let's calculate the total number of jeruk that will be available after 87 days:  Total number of jeruk after 87 days = Daily collection x Number of days  Therefore, the total number of jeruk that will be available after 87 days is:  Total number of jeruk after 87 days = 1650 x 87 = 143,500 jeruk  So, there will be approximately 143,500 jeruk available after 87 days.
Response:  If they harvest 8 bags of rice per day and each bag contains 35 rice grains, then we can calculate how many rice grains they collect in one day as follows: Number of rice grains collected = Total number of rice grains / Number of bags per day So, if they collect 8 bags of rice per day, then the total number of rice grains they collect is: 8 x 35 = 280 rice grains per day. Therefore, the correct answer is 280.
Response:  If they harvest 16 begs per day and each beg contains 57 orens, then the total number of orens collected daily is: 16 x 57 = 902 orens per day. To collect 80 begs of orens, we need to multiply the number of days required to collect 1 beg of orens by 80: 902 orens/day x 80 begs = 72,160 orens. Therefore, it will take approximately 72,160 / 902 = 80 days to collect 80 begs of orens.
Response:  If they harvest 67 bunches of grapes per day and each bunch contains 12 grapes, then the total number of grapes harvested daily is: 67 x 12 = 804 grapes per day.  Now, if they harvest 35 bunches of grapes in total, then the total number of grapes harvested is: 804 x 35 = 28,200 grapes.
Response:  If they harvest 74 begs daily and throw away 71 of them, then they have 3 begs left after 51 days. So, the number of begs they will have after 51 days is 3.
Response:  If they harvest 76 begs per day and throw away 64 of them, then the number of jeruk they collect is equal to the number of begs they don't throw away. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of jeruk = Number of begs not thrown away  In this case, the number of begs not thrown away is 12 (76 - 64). Therefore, the number of jeruk collected per day is also 12.
"Response:  If they harvested 28 beg oren matang and 52 beg oren not yet ripe daily, then after 26 days of ripening, they will have collected a total of:

$$ Total = 28 \times Matang + 52 \times NotMatang $$

We know that $ 28 \times Matang = 704 $ (since there are 28 beg oren matang) and $ 52 \times NotMatang = 1328 $ (since there are 52 beg oren not yet ripe). Therefore, we can write:

$$ Total = 704 + 1328 = 2032 $$

So, after 26 days of ripening, they will have a total of 2032 beg oren."
"Response:  If they harvest 82 beg oren matang and 61 beg oren that are not yet ripe every day, then after 25 days of ripening, they will have a total of:

Matang beg oren = 82 + (61 x 25) = 2340 beg oren
So, there will be 2340 beg oren matang after 25 days of ripening."
"Response:  If they harvest 31 beg oren matang and 24 beg oren that are not yet ripe every day, then after 45 days of ripening, they will have collected a total of:

$$ Total = 31 \times Matang + 24 \times NotMatang $$

We know that $ BegOrenMatang = 31 $ and $ BegOrenNotMatang = 24 $. So we can substitute these values into the equation above to get:

$$ Total = 31 \times 31 + 24 \times 24 $$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$$ Total = 1067 $$

Therefore, after 45 days of ripening, they will have collected a total of 1067 beg oren that are not yet ripe."
Response:  If there are 44 beg oren matang and 25 beg oren that have not yet ripened each day, then the total number of beg oren (both ripe and unripe) is 44 + 25 = 69 beg oren per day. So, more than half of the beg oren (which is 69/2 = 34.5) are ripe. Therefore, the number of ripe beg oren per day is 34.5.
Response:  If there are 5 beg of immature lemons and 74 beg of mature lemons harvested daily, then the total number of beg of lemons harvested daily is:  Total beg of lemons harvested daily = 5 + 74 = 89 beg of lemons. Now, to find out how many more immature lemons than mature lemons are harvested daily, we need to subtract the number of mature lemons from the total number of beg of lemons harvested daily: Number of more immature lemons harvested daily = Total beg of lemons harvested daily - Number of mature lemons harvested daily = 89 - 74 = 15 more immature lemons harvested daily. Therefore, there are 15 more immature lemons than mature lemons harvested daily.
Response:  If they have harvested 54 beg oren in total and they are harvesting 18 beg oren per day, then it will take them __________ days to harvest all of them.  Solution:  To find out how many days it will take for them to harvest all of the beg oren, we can divide the total amount of beg oren (54) by the daily amount they are harvesting (18). So, it will take them __________ days to harvest all of the beg oren.
Response:  If they harvested 56 begor for 1 day, then they will have harvested 56 x 14 = 780 begor for 14 days. Therefore, they will have harvested 780 begor each day.
"Response:  If they harvest 25 immature dates every day and 5 mature dates every day, then after 73 days of ripening, they will have collected a total of:
Immature dates = 25 x 73 = 1825
Mature dates = 5 x 73 = 365
So, in total, they will have collected 1825 + 365 = 2190 dates after 73 days of ripening."
Response:  If they harvested 65 immature dates every day and there were 46 mature dates every day, then after 6 days of ripening, the total number of immature dates would be: 65 x 6 = 390 immature dates. So, the number of immature dates they will have after 6 days of ripening is 390.
Response:  If there are 41 immature oranges and 86 mature oranges harvested each day, then the total number of oranges harvested daily is:  Total oranges = Immature oranges + Mature oranges  Total oranges = 41 + 86  Total oranges = 127  So, more than half (59) of the oranges harvested daily are mature ones.
Response:  If there are 71 immature oranges and 60 mature oranges harvested each day, then the total number of oranges harvested daily is:  Immature oranges + Mature oranges = 71 + 60 = 131 oranges per day. Now, to find out how many more immature oranges than mature oranges are harvested daily, we need to subtract the number of mature oranges from the total number of oranges harvested:  Number of immature oranges harvested - Number of mature oranges harvested = 131 - 60 = 71 more immature oranges harvested daily than mature oranges. Therefore, the answer is 71 more immature oranges are harvested daily than mature oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. So, if we calculate the length of Jesse in relation to its width, we get: Length = 12 ft Width = 11 ft Now, let's find out how much longer Jesse is than it is wide: Longer = Length - Width = 12 ft - 11 ft = 1 foot Therefore, for every one foot that Jesse is wide (11 ft), he is 1 foot longer (12 ft).
Response:  If Jesse is 7 feet tall (which is equal to 216 inches), and he needs a canvas that is 14 feet wide (which is equal to 1680 inches). So we can calculate the length of the canvas as follows: Length = Height x Width = 216 inches x 1680 inches = 369,600 inches Therefore, the width of the canvas needed for Jesse is 369,600 inches or approximately 30 feet.
"Response:  If Jesse's room is 7 feet wide and he needs a rug that is 14 square feet in size, we can calculate the length of the rug as follows:
Length = Width x Area Required / Room Width
= 7 x 14 / 7
= 98 inches
Therefore, the length of the rug Jesse needs is approximately 98 inches or 8.25 feet."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the room is 11 feet (kaki) and its width is 15 feet (kaki). So, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Now, we are asked how many square feet of carpeting Jessie needs to cover the entire floor. To find this out, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of one square foot of carpeting. Therefore, the number of square feet of carpeting Jessie needs to cover the entire floor is: Number of square feet of carpeting = Total area / Area of one square foot of carpeting = 165 / 9 = 18 square feet. So, Jessie needs 18 square feet of carpeting to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Jesse is 2 feet tall and 12 feet wide. To cover the entire floor with tiles, we need to calculate how many tiles are needed based on the area of the floor. The formula for finding the area of a rectangle is A = length x width, so in this case, the area of the floor is: Area = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Now, since each tile covers an area of 4 square feet, we can divide the total area of the floor by the size of each tile to find out how many tiles are needed: Number of tiles = Total area / Size of each tile = 24 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 6 tiles. Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that each box of Jesse is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. So, if he has 20 boxes, we need to find out how many square feet are covered by all these boxes. The area of one box = length x width = 19 x 18 = 352 square feet. Therefore, the total area covered by all 20 boxes = 20 x 352 = 7040 square feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long. Now, let's calculate how many times longer he is than he is wide. We can do this by dividing his length by his width:  Length / Width = 20 ft / 19 ft = 1.056 (approximately) So, Jesse is approximately 10% longer than he is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs to cover his room with a carpet of size 10 square feet (kaki). Since we are given that the length of the room is 5 feet (kaki), we can calculate the width of the room as follows:  Width = Length / Size of Carpet  Width = 5 kaki / 10 kaki  = 0.5 kaki or 2 feet So, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.
Response:  We know that the area of the carpet needed is 10 square feet and it needs to cover a room with a width of 2 feet. So we can start by finding out how long the room is in feet. To do this, we divide the width of the room (in feet) by the width of the carpet (in feet). In this case, if the room is 2 feet wide, then the length of the room is:  $ \frac {2}{1} = 2$ feet $$ Therefore, the length of the room is 2 feet. Now we have all the information we need to find the area of the room. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = Length x Width $$ Area = 2 x 2 = 4 square feet $$ Therefore, the area of the room is 4 square feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor. Since the length of the room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, we can calculate the area of the room as follows: Area = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sqft Now, since Jesse has 18 sqft of carpet, we need to divide the total area of the room by the amount of carpet he has: Total Area / Amount of Carpet = 80 sqft / 18 sqft = 4.44 times more carpet than needed So, Jesse needs approximately 4.44 times more carpet than he currently has to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Kedai baju Razorback made $ 23 for each shirt they sold. So if they sold x t-shirts, their total revenue would be $ 23x. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they earned $ 230 selling t-shirts. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  $ 23x = 230  To solve this equation, divide both sides of the equation by $ 23:  x = 10  So, Kedai baju Razorback sold 10 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kedai baju Razorback sold 3 shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, the total revenue from selling those shirts is $ 51 dollars. Now, to find out how much each shirt cost, we can divide the total revenue by the number of shirts sold: $ 51 / 3 = $ 17 per shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $ 17.
Response:  If they sold 95 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game and made $87 for each shirt, then they made a total of $8325 from selling T-shirts ($87 x 95 = $8325). Now, if they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make from those sales? So, we can calculate it as follows: Total amount earned from T-shirt sales = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt Total amount earned from T-shirt sales = 47 x $87 = $4099 Therefore, the answer is $4099.
Response:  If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and their total sales were 242 T-shirts, then the number of T-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game is equal to 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, they sold 127 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that during the Arkansas game, they sold 89 t-shirts and made $98 per t-shirt. So, in total, they made $8,722 ($98 x 90). During the Texas Tech game, they sold 163 t-shirts and made $98 per t-shirt, so they made $15,454 ($98 x 163) altogether. Therefore, if they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they made $8,722 from those sales.
Response:  If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and made $78 per t-shirt, then they made total revenue of $78 x 172 = $13,040 from selling t-shirts during that game. Now, we are told that they also sold 186 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. So, if they made $13,040 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much did they make from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game? We can find this out by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game by the amount they made per t-shirt during that game: $13,040 x 186 = $25,296. Therefore, they made $25,296 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is 183 + 31 = 214. Since each shirt costs $ 62, the total revenue from selling shirts is 214 x $ 62 = $ 13,058.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold during the game was 74, and the price per shirt was $ 67. Therefore, the total amount earned from selling shirts is:  Total revenue = Number of shirts x Price per shirt = 74 x $ 67 = $ 4892.  Now let's move on to the jerseys. During the game, they sold 156 jerseys at a price of $ 165 each. So the total amount earned from selling jerseys is:  Total revenue = Number of jerseys x Price per jersey = 156 x $ 165 = $ 25,340.  Therefore, in total, they earned $ 25,828 ($ 4892 + $ 25,340) from selling both shirts and jerseys during the game.
Response:  We know that Kedai Razorback sold 157 T-shirts and 19 Jerseys during their match against Arkansas and Texas Tech. To find out how much money they made from each item, we can use the prices given in the question: $ 192 for T-shirts and $ 34 for Jerseys. So, if they sold X T-shirts, they would make $ 192X dollars, and if they sold Y Jerseys, they would make $ 34Y dollars. Since they sold more T-shirts than Jerseys (157 vs 19), let's start by finding out how much money they made from T-shirts: $$ 192 \times 157 = $ 28,606 $$ Now, let's find out how much money they made from Jerseys: $$ 34 \times 19 = $ 656 $$ Therefore, the total amount of money Kedai Razorback made from both items is: $$ 28,606 + 656 = $ 29,262 $$ So, the number of T-shirts sold is: $$ \frac {29,262}{192} = 157 $$ And the number of Jerseys sold is: $$ \frac {29,262}{34} = 87 $$
"Response:  We know that Kedai Razorback sold 254 shirts and 43 jerseys during their match against Arkansas and Texas Tech. From this information, we can calculate the ratio of the number of jerseys to the number of shirts as follows:

Number of jerseys / Number of shirts = (43) / (254) = 0.17 or approximately 17%

Now, let's find out how much more expensive each jersey is compared to each shirt:

$232 (jersey price) - $86 (shirt price) = $146 ($/jersey - $/shirt)

So, for every jersey sold, Kedai Razorback made an additional profit of $146 compared to each shirt."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each shirt costs $ 51 dollars and they sell every shirt for this price. So, if they sold x shirts, their total revenue from selling shirts would be $ 51x.  Next, we are given that during the game, they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. Therefore, their total revenue from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Discount Per T-Shirt $ 8 x 130 = $ 1,040 Now, let's find out how much money they made from both shirts and t-shirts by adding their total revenue from both sources: Total Revenue from Shirts + Total Revenue from T-Shirts = $ 51x + $ 1,040 $ 51x + $ 1,040 = $ 1,091 This means that they made a total of $ 1,091 in revenue from selling both shirts and t-shirts during the game.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 14 (t-shirts) + 201 (dresses). So we have: Total Number of Shirts = 14 + 201 = 215 shirts. Now, let's calculate how much money they made from selling each shirt: Money Made per T-Shirt = Price per T-Shirt x Number of T-Shirts Sold = $ 217 x 14 = $ 3,068. Therefore, they made $ 3,068 from selling t-shirts.
Response:  We know that Arkansas and Texas Tech sold $ 60 worth of merchandise. If they made $ 10 per T-shirt sold, then we can calculate how many T-shirts they sold as follows: Number of T-shirts = Total revenue / Price per T-shirt So, number of T-shirts = $ 60 / $ 10 = 6 T-shirts Therefore, Arkansas and Texas Tech sold 6 T-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that Arkansas and Texas Tech sold $215 worth of merchandise (t-shirts). If they sold 5 t-shirts, then we can calculate the cost per t-shirt as follows: Cost per t-shirt = Total revenue / Number of t-shirts sold = $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt. Therefore, the cost per t-shirt is $43.
Response:  The total amount of money that Kedai Razorback made from selling T-shirts is given as $215. Since they sold 20 T-shirts during the game against Arkansas and Texas Tech, we can find out how much each T-shirt cost by dividing the total amount of money they made by the number of T-shirts they sold: $$ 215 = 20 \times price$$  We are asked to find out how much money Kedai Razorback made from selling each T-shirt. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 20: $$price = 215 / 20 = $10.75$$ So, each T-shirt costs $10.75.
Response:  The cost price of one razorback shirt is $ 204 and that of one jersey is $ 76. So if they sell 158 t-shirts and 2 jerseys, their total revenue from these sales will be: Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Cost Price of T-Shirt + Number of Jerseys x Cost Price of Jersey  Revenue = 158 x $ 76 + 2 x $ 76  Revenue = $ 11,936  Therefore, the amount of money they can get from selling those jerseys is $ 11,936.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling T-shirts is equal to the number of T-shirts sold multiplied by the price of each T-shirt. Similarly, we can calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys as the number of jerseys sold multiplied by their price. So, if we have x T-shirts and y jerseys sold, then the total revenue from selling T-shirts is x \* $ 240 = 240x, and the total revenue from selling jerseys is y \* $ 210 = 210y. Now, we are given that the total revenue from both T-shirts and jerseys is $ 210 + $ 240 = $ 450. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 240x + 210y = 450. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 177 and y = 23. So, there were 177 T-shirts and 23 jerseys sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 113. Since each shirt costs $25, the total revenue from shirts is $25 x 113 = $2725. Now we are asked to find out how many jerseys were sold. We know that the total number of items sold is 113 + 78 = 191. So, the ratio of jerseys to shirts can be found by dividing the number of jerseys by the total number of items sold: Jerseys / Total Items Sold = 78/191 = 0.406 or approximately 40.6%. Therefore, there were approximately 40.6% of the total items sold as jerseys and 59.4% as shirts.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs.
Response:  If there are 12 chairs behind their house and they have two tables with the same number of chairs, then the number of chairs for each table is half of the total number of chairs. So, if there are 12 chairs behind the house, then there are 6 chairs per table.
Response:  If they have 9 chairs in their backyard and each table has 3 chairs, then we can calculate the number of tables as follows: Number of tables = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per table = 9 chairs / 3 chairs per table = 3 tables. Therefore, there are 3 sets of tables behind their house.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows:  Total number of chairs = Number of sets x Number of chairs per set  Total number of chairs = 11 x 13  Total number of chairs = 143 chairs. Therefore, there are 143 chairs behind their house.
Response:  If there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  Since there are 11 people sitting at the tables, that means 5 chairs are left empty (since 11 - 6 = 5). So, 5 chairs are left kosong.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Then we have 6 additional chairs for guests, so the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs.  If 14 people will attend the party, then we need to buy additional chairs to accommodate them. So, the answer is 12 + 4 = 16 chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs is:  9 x 14 = 126 chairs.
"Response:  If Lewis received $460 in 5 weeks, then he would have earned:
$460 x 5 = $2300
So, he can earn up to $2300 per week."
"Response:  If Lewis got $ 1216 throughout the season, and he received $ 16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks the season lasted as follows:
$ 1216 / $ 16 = x weeks
x = 78 weeks (rounded to nearest whole number)
Therefore, the season lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response:  If Lewis gets $ 21 every week for 216 weeks of retirement, and he needs to pay taxes of $ 702, then we can calculate how much money will be left after paying taxes as follows:

Total amount earned = Number of weeks x Weekly earnings
= 216 x $ 21
= $ 4,592

Taxes paid = Total amount earned x Tax rate
= $ 4,592 x 15% (assuming a 15% tax rate)
= $ 688.30

So, the total amount left after paying taxes is:
$ 4,592 - $ 688.30 = $ 3,903.70
Therefore, there will be $ 3,903.70 left after paying taxes at the end of the retirement period."
Response:  If Lewis makes $1357 per week for 223 weeks during the season, he will have earned total amount of money which is equal to:  Total amount = Number of weeks x Weekly income  Total amount = 223 x $1357  Total amount = $296,410  Therefore, if Lewis works for 73 seasons, he will have earned a total amount of money which is equal to:  Total amount = $296,410 x 73  Total amount = $20,873,300  So, the answer is $20,873,300.
Response:  If Lewis works overtime every week for how many weeks, he will get an additional amount of money. So, we need to find out how many weeks he can work overtime in total. According to the question, Lewis is retired and has been receiving $28 per week for 1091 weeks. This means that he has worked full-time for 1091 weeks before retiring. Therefore, he can work overtime for at most 1091 - 109 = 982 weeks. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis can earn from working overtime. According to the question, he gets $939 per week for working overtime. Since he can work overtime for up to 982 weeks, his total earnings from working overtime are: Total earnings = Number of weeks x Weekly income from overtime = 982 x $939 = $915,640
Response:  If Lewis gets $403 every week for 233 weeks, he will have earned a total of $93,536 ($403 x 233).  To find out how much money he can afford to pay in rent each week, we need to subtract the amount he has already spent on rent from his total earnings. So, if he needs to pay $49 in rent each week, the number of weeks he can afford to pay this amount is: $$ \therefore \text {Number of weeks Lewis can afford to pay } = \frac{\text{Total earnings - Rent cost}}{\text{Rent cost}} = \frac{93536 - 49}{49} = 1978$$ Therefore, Lewis can afford to pay $49 in rent each week for 1978 weeks or approximately 47 years.
Response:  If Lewis gets $ 368 every week for 1359 weeks of retirement, and he needs to pay rent of $ 388 per week for how many times, we can calculate it as follows: Number of times = Total amount of rent / Amount of rent per week Total amount of rent = $ 368 x 1359 = $ 472,000 Amount of rent per week = $ 388 So, Lewis pays rent for 472,000 / $ 388 = 1221 times. Therefore, the answer is 1221 times.
Response:  If Lewis gets $491 every week for 1181 weeks, then he will have total earnings of: $$ = \text {Total number of weeks} \times \text{Weekly income}$$ = 1181 \times 491 = $573,091  Now, if he needs to pay rent of $216 per week for how many weeks, we can calculate it as follows: $$ = \text {Number of weeks for which rent is paid} \times \text{Rent amount per week}$$ = x \times 216 =?  Since Lewis has earned $573,091 and needs to pay rent for x weeks, we can find the value of x by dividing his total earnings by the rent amount: $$ = \frac{\$573,091}{216} = 266$$ Therefore, Lewis needs to pay rent for 266 weeks.
Response:  If Lewis received $ 133 for 19 weeks, then he would have received a total of $ 2507 ($ 133 x 19). So, he can get around $ 128 per week ($ 2507 / 19 weeks).
Response:  If Lewis gets $ 2 per week during the harvest season, and he got $ 178 in total, then we can calculate the number of weeks as follows: Number of weeks = Total amount received / Weekly income $ 178 / $ 2 per week = 89 weeks So, Lewis got $ 2 per week for 89 weeks during the harvest season.
"Response:  If the depth of the water is 10 times greater than Dean and he stands at a height of 9 feet above the water level, then we can calculate how much deeper the water is compared to his height as follows:

Depth of water = 10 x Height of Dean = 10 x 9 = 90 feet

So, the water is 90 feet deeper than Dean's height."
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. So if Ron stands at 14 feet above sea level in water with a depth of 2 times Dean's height, then we can say that Ron stands at 14 - (8 x 2) = 10 feet above sea level in water.
"Response:  We know that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. So if Ron stands at 12 feet above water level, then Dean will stand at:

Dean = Ron - 11 feet
= 12 feet - 11 feet
= 1 foot

So, Dean will be 1 foot below the water level."
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet (or 48 inches) taller than Ron. So if Ron stands at 13 feet (or 162 inches) in the water, then Dean will stand at 17 feet (or 190 inches). Therefore, Ron will be submerged underwater to a depth of 15 times his height, which is equal to 15 x 162 = 243 inches or 20.5 feet.
Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron by 9 feet (or 2.7 meters). So if Ron stands at 13 feet (or 4 meters) in the water, then Dean will stand at 22 feet (or 6.7 meters) tall. Now we can use the given information about the depth of the water to find out how deep the water is relative to where Dean is standing. Since the depth of the water is 16 times the height of Ron, and Ron is 9 feet tall, the depth of the water is 16 x 9 = 144 feet (or 43.6 meters) deep. Therefore, Dean is standing at approximately 22 + 43.6 = 65.6 feet (or 20 meters) above the bottom of the ocean.
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean is 9 feet tall (since he is 6 feet shorter than Ron). Now, we need to find out how deep the water is. According to the question, the depth of the water is 9 times the height of Dean. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet. Since Ron is 15 feet tall and the depth of the water is 81 feet, the water is 81 - 15 = 66 feet deep.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he puts them in two bookshelves, then each shelf will have half of his books, which is 17 books (half of 34). So there are 17 books in each shelf.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf = 42 / 2 = 21 shelves. Therefore, Brian has 21 shelves of books.
"Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each shelf can hold 23 books, then the total number of shelves needed to store all his books is:

$$ \text {Total Number of Shelves} = \frac{\text{Number of Books}}{ \text{Number of Books per Shelf}} $$

In this case, we have:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total Number of Shelves} &= \frac{27}{23} \\ &= 11 \end{aligned} $$
So, Brian needs 11 shelves to store all his books."
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each shelf can hold 10 books, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 books in total. Now, if he also has 46 magazines and each shelf can hold 10 magazines, then he has 46 / 10 = 4.6 magazines per shelf. So, in total, Brian has 90 books + (4.6 x 10) = 460 magazines.
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and each shelf can hold up to 29 books, then he must have at least 2 shelves full of books. Therefore, he has 2 x 23 = 46 books in total. Similarly, if he has 61 magazines and each shelf can hold up to 29 magazines, then he must have at least 2 shelves full of magazines. Therefore, he has 2 x 61 = 122 magazines in total. So, Brian has 46 books and 122 magazines in total.
Response:  If Brian has 28 books and he has 7 shelves with each shelf containing an equal number of books, then we can assume that there are 28 / 7 = 4 books in each shelf. So, there are 4 x 7 = 28 books in total across all 7 shelves.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then we can calculate the number of bookshelves as follows:  Number of bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf = 38 books / 2 books/shelf = 19 shelves So, there are 19 bookshelves that Brian has.
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 10 friends for her birthday and each box of gift contains 2 gifts, then she needs $ \boxed{X} $ boxes of gift.  We can write an equation as follows: $\boxed{X} = 10 - 2\cdot9 = 7$. Therefore, Carol needs 7 boxes of gift to make sure that no friend is left out.
Response:  If Carol invites 12 friends to her birthday party and buys 3 bouquets of flowers for each friend, then the total number of bouquets she will buy is:  Number of bouquets = Total number of guests x Number of bouquets per guest  Number of bouquets = 12 x 3  Number of bouquets = 36 bouquets So, there are 36 bouquets in each set.
Response:  If Carol buys 7 bags of invitations and each bag contains 10 invitations, then she has bought a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  Now, if she sends them to 2 friends, we need to divide the number of invitations by 2. So, there will be 70 invitations / 2 = 35 invitations left after she sends them to her 2 friends.
Response:  Firstly, Carol bought 6 boxes of invitations with each box containing 14 invitations. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations in her first purchase. Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, bringing the total number to 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. So, there are 95 people that Carol can invite.
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 9 friends and each box contains 3 invitations, then she needs to buy how many boxes of invitations?  To find out, we can use multiplication: Number of boxes = Total number of invitations / Number of invitations in each box  In this case, the total number of invitations is 9 x 3 = 27 invitations. So, Carol needs to buy 27 / 3 = 9 boxes of invitations. Therefore, the answer is 9 boxes.
Response:  If Melissa catches 12 fish in each game, then she will catch a total of 36 fish if she plays 3 games. So, the answer is 3 games.
Response:  In each game, Melissa scored 81 points. So in total, she scored 81 x 3 = 243 points. Therefore, the number of balls that Melissa can get in each game is 243.
Response:  If Melissa scores 109 points in each match and gets 82 points as bonus, then her total score for one match is: Total Score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, if she plays 79 matches, her total score will be: Total Score = 191 x 79 = 14,539 points. Therefore, Melissa can get up to 14,539 points in 79 matches.
Response:  If Melissa caught 21 fish in several matches and she caught 7 fish in each match, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of matches = Total number of fish / Number of fish caught in each match  In this case, the total number of fish is 21, and the number of fish caught in each match is 7. So, we can plug these values into the equation to get:  Number of matches = 21 / 7  Number of matches = 3  Therefore, Melissa played 3 matches.
Response:  If Melissa scores 91 points in 13 matches and gets the same score (91) in each match, then she must have scored at least 91 points in each of those 13 matches. So, the total number of points Melissa can get is 13 x 91 = 1123 points.
Response:  We know that there are 4 seats in each rod of Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise. If we have 20 people riding the Ferris wheel at the same time, how many people can sit in each seat?  Therefore, the number of people who can sit in each seat is 20 / 4 = 5. So, the total number of people who can sit and enjoy the view from each rod of Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise is 5 x 4 = 20.
Response:  We know that there are several seats in each place of the Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise. Each seat can accommodate 9 people. Now we need to find out how many chairs are available on the Ferris wheel. To do this, we divide the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel (18) by the number of seats per chair (9). So, the answer is:  Number of chairs = Total number of riders / Number of seats per chair  In this case, the answer is:  Number of chairs = 18 / 9  = 2 Therefore, there are 2 chairs available on the Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise for each place.
Response:  We know that each Ferris wheel has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, we have: Number of Ferris wheels = Total number of passengers = 19 x 15 = 285 people. So, 20 Ferris wheels can accommodate 20 x 285 = 5700 people at the same time.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many places there are in total for people to sit on the Ferris wheel. According to the question, there are 18 places to sit.  Next, we need to calculate how many people can fit in each place. As mentioned earlier, each place can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at one time is:  Number of places = 18  Capacity per place = 15  Total capacity = Number of places x Capacity per place = 18 x 15 = 270 people. So, if 10 chairs break down, it means that only 270 - 10 = 260 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously.
Response:  We know that there are 6 places to sit in the Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise and each place can accommodate 14 people. If there are currently 16 people sitting on the Ferris wheel, how many more people can join? To find out, we need to subtract the number of people already sitting from the total capacity of the Ferris wheel. So, the answer is:  Number of additional people who can join = Total capacity - Current occupancy = 6 x 14 = 84 - 16 = 68 people. Therefore, there can be up to 68 more people join the Ferris wheel if it has reached its maximum capacity of 6 times 14 people (or 84 people).
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in total. If we divide the number of large seats by the capacity of each seat, we get: Number of people who can fit in each large seat = 23 / 54 = 0.42 (or approximately 42%) Now, let's calculate how many people can fit in each small seat: Number of people who can fit in each small seat = 2 x 14 = 28 So, the maximum number of people who can fit in both types of seats is: Maximum number of people who can fit = 28 + 42 = 70 Therefore, the maximum number of people who can fit in the Ferris wheel at Taman Paradise is 70.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, while each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, we need to find out how many people can fit in all 10 seats (small + large) together.  Therefore, the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the large seats is:  Number of people who can ride = Total number of seats x Capacity per seat  = 10 x 12  = 120 people
"Response:  If there are 16 people riding the Ferris wheel in heaven at the same time, and each Ferris wheel has 4 seats, then we can calculate how many times 16 goes into 4 as follows:

16 / 4 = 4

So, 16 people can ride the Ferris wheel in heaven at the same time if each seat has 4 people."
Response:  If there are 4 people riding the Ferris wheel in heaven at the same time, then we can assume that each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 2 people. Therefore, the total number of seats available on the Ferris wheel is 4 x 2 = 8. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 7 pizzas in total and each pizza has the same number of slices. So, if we divide the total number of slices (14) by the number of pizzas (7), we get the average number of slices per pizza: $ \frac{14}{7} = 2$ slices per pizza. Therefore, there are 2 slices in each pizza.
Response:  If we have 28 pieces of pizza and each piece has two slices, then we can calculate the total number of slices as follows: Total Number of Slices = Number of Pizzas x Number of Slices per Pizza Total Number of Slices = 28 x 2 = 56 slices So, if we want to know how many pizzas we can buy with 28 pieces of pizza, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of slices in one pizza: Number of Pizzas = Total Number of Slices / Number of Slices per Pizza Number of Pizzas = 56 / 2 = 28 pizzas Therefore, we can buy 28 pizzas with 28 pieces of pizza.
Response:  If there are 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 pieces, then the total number of pieces of pizza is: 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of pizza. So, if there are 25 people from our group at the place where the pizzas are, then the number of pieces of pizza that each person will get is: 68 / 25 = 2.72 pieces of pizza per person.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas in total and each pizza has 10 pieces. If we want to divide them equally among ourselves, how many will we get per person?  To find out, let's divide 9 (total number of pizzas) by 9 (number of people). So, each person will get 1 pizza = 10 pieces.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each flower pot, then they have planted a total of 10 x 45 = 450 seeds. Therefore, there are 450 benih that they have planted.
Response:  If they planted the same number of seeds in each flower pot, then the total number of seeds they planted is equal to the number of flower pots multiplied by the number of seeds in each pot.  Therefore, if they planted 45 seeds in 9 flower pots, the total number of seeds they planted is 45 x 9 = 395 seeds.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total, then they must have had x number of catlings (katils) to accommodate all those seeds. Since only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each catling, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of catlings = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds that grew into flowers  In this case, we know that the total number of seeds is 36, and the number of seeds that grew into flowers per catling is 58. So, we can plug these values into our equation to solve for x:  Number of catlings = 36 / 58  Number of catlings = 6  Therefore, there were 6 catlings (or flower pots) used by Paige and her mother to grow the flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total, then they must have planted x + 15 seeds where x is the number of seeds that grew into flowers. Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each pot, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 15 = 60  Now, let's solve for x:  Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:  x = 45  Therefore, there were 45 seeds that did not grow into flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each pot of flowers, then they have 60 seeds in total (10 x 6 = 60). Since there are 60 pots of flowers, each pot contains 10 seeds (60 / 10 = 6). Therefore, Paige and her mother have 6 pots of flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 8 flowers in total, then they must have planted an equal number of seeds (benih) for each flower. So, if they planted 32 seeds altogether, that means they planted 4 seeds per flower (since 32 / 8 = 4). Therefore, there are 4 benih (seeds) in each flower.
Response:  If Matthew has x number of keropok and he gives 2 keropok to each of his 11 friends, then the total number of keropok given away is 2x + 11 = 22. So, Matthew has x - 22 keropok left.
Response:  If Matthew gives 2 keropok to each of his friends, then he will give a total of 2 x number of friends = 16 keropok in total. So, there are 16 friends that Matthew gave keropok to.
"Response:  If Matthew has 15 keropok and gives an equal number to each of his 5 friends, then he will give:
Matthew = 15 / 5 = 3 keropok per friend.
So, if Matthew still has 10 keropok left after giving them out, that means each friend got 3 keropok x 5 friends = 15 keropok in total."
Response:  If Matthew has 24 keropok and he gives an equal amount to each of his three friends, then he will give 8 keropok to each friend (since there are 3 friends). So, the total number of keropok that Matthew gives away is 8 x 3 = 24.  As for how many keropok Matthew still has left after giving them away, we can subtract the number of keropok he gave away from the original 24: 24 - 24 = 0, so Matthew still has all 24 keropok left.
Response:  If Matthew has 22 keropok and wants to share them equally among his 11 friends, each friend will get 2 (2/11) keropok.  Now, if Matthew gives the same amount of kek to his friends, each friend will get 34 / 11 = 3 keks.
Response:  If Matthew has 29 keropok and 30 kek, and he gives an equal amount of both to 2 friends, then we can say that each friend gets 14.5 keropok (2 x 29) and 15 kek (2 x 30). So, if one friend eats 15 kek, how many will the other friend eat?
Response:  If Matthew has 14 cookies and 21 crackers to share among his 7 friends, we need to divide them equally so each friend gets an equal amount.  To do this, we can use division.  We know that there are 14 cookies in total, and Matthew wants to give each of his 7 friends an equal number of cookies. So if he gives 14 cookies to one friend, then each of the remaining 6 friends will get 14/6 = 2 cookies each. Similarly, if he gives 21 crackers to one friend, then each of the remaining 6 friends will get 21/6 = 3 crackers each. Therefore, the number of cookies each friend will get is 2, and the number of crackers each friend will get is 3.
"Response:  If Matthew has 36 pieces of keropok and he wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, then each friend will get:

$$ \text{Number of keropok per person} = \frac{\text{Total number of keropok}}{\text{Number of people}} $$

So, in this case:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of keropok per person} = \frac{36}{18} = 2}} $$

Therefore, each of Matthew's 18 friends will get $2$ pieces of keropok."
Response:  If Matthew gives 6 keropok to each of his friends, and he has 36 friends in total, then the number of keropok he gave away is:  Number of keropok given = Total number of friends x Number of keropok given per friend  Number of keropok given = 36 x 6  Number of keropok given = 216
Response:  If Matthew has 23 keropok and he gives an equal number to 2 friends, then there are 23 / 2 = 11 keropok left after he gives them away. So each friend gets 11/2 = 5.5 keropok. Since we can't have half of a keropok, the final answer is 5 keropok per friend.
"Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 keropok and he wants to share them equally among his 5 friends. So, we can start by dividing the total number of keropok by the number of friends:  Number of keropok per friend = Total number of keropok / Number of friends  Number of keropok per friend = 31 / 5  Number of keropok per friend = 6  
So, Matthew gave each of his 5 friends 6 keropok in total."
Response:  If Matthew has 32 keropok and gives an equal amount to each of his 4 friends, then he will give: $32 / 4 = 8 keropok per friend.  So, if each friend eats 8 keropok, there are now $32 - 8 = 24 keropok left with Matthew.  Then, if he gives an equal amount to each of his next 3 friends (who also eat 8 keropok each), there are now $24 - 8 = 16 keropok left with him.  Therefore, the number of keropok that Matthew has after giving them all away is: $16.
Response:  If Matthew has 10 kek and he gives an equal amount to each of his 4 friends, then the total number of keks given away is 10 x 4 = 40 keks. Now, if each friend eats an equal amount of keks as Matthew does, then they will eat 40/5 = 8 keks each. Therefore, there are 8 keks eaten by each person.
Response:  If Matthew has 13 keropok and 15 kek to share among his 28 friends, we can start by dividing the total number of snacks (keropok + kek) by the number of people he is sharing with:  Total snacks = 13 + 15 = 28 Snacks per person = Total snacks / Number of people = 28/28 = 1 Therefore, each person will get 1 keropok and 1 kek.
Response:  If Debbie buys several bottles of water when they are being sold and she drinks 109 bottles per day, then we can calculate how many bottles she bought based on the number of days she drank them.  Since there are 74 hours in a day, if Debbie drank 109 bottles per day for 74 days, then she must have drunk a total of 8263 bottles (109 x 74 = 8263). Therefore, she must have bought at least 8263 bottles.
"Response:  If Debbie drank 153 bottles of air per day and each bottle lasted for 17 days, then she would have drunk a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = \text{Number of bottles per day} \times \text{Days taken to finish} $$

Given that Debbie drank $153$ bottles per day and took $17$ days to finish them all, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total number of bottles}} = 153 \times 17 = 2591 $$

Therefore, Debbie drank $\boxed{2591}$ bottles of air per day."
Response:  If Debbie bought 264 bottles of air and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she still has as follows:  Day 1: Debbie drinks 15 bottles, so she has 264 - 15 = 249 bottles left.  Day 2: Debbie drinks another 15 bottles, so she has 249 - 15 = 234 bottles left.  And so on...  After 11 days, Debbie will have drunk a total of 15 x 11 = 165 bottles, leaving her with 264 - 165 = 99 bottles remaining. So, Debbie still has 99 bottles of air.
Response:  If Debbie sells 301 bottles of air per day and she drinks 144 bottles per day for several days, then there are 301 - 144 = 157 bottles left after she finishes her daily consumption for several days. So, in how many days will she finish all the remaining bottles if she continues to consume at the same rate? Solution: To find out how many days it takes Debbie to finish all the remaining bottles, we need to divide the number of remaining bottles (157) by her daily consumption (144). This gives us approximately 11 days. Therefore, Debbie will finish all the remaining bottles in approximately 11 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were sold, then she has a total of 101 bottles (88 + 13).  If she drinks 4 bottles of water per day, then in how many days will her supply of water run out?  To find this out, we can divide the number of bottles of water she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day:  Number of days = Total bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day  In this case, the number of days is:  Number of days = 101 / 4 = 25.25 days So, if Debbie drinks 4 bottles of water per day, her supply of water will last for approximately 25.25 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda, then she has a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drank 312 bottles of water in a certain number of days, then she had 144 bottles left (456 - 312 = 144).  Now, if she drank 4 bottles of soda per day, then she will run out of soda in 36 days (144 / 4 = 36).
"Response:  If Debbie consumes 6 bottles of water per day and she buys 12 bottles of water in total, then we can calculate how many days it will last her as follows:

Debbie's daily consumption = 6 bottles/day
Total number of bottles bought = 12 bottles
Days to last = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 12 bottles / 6 bottles/day
= 2 days
Therefore, if Debbie buys 12 bottles of water, it will last her for 2 days."
Response:  If Debbie drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day for x days, then we can calculate how many bottles of water she will have left after that time using the following formula: Number of bottles of water remaining = Total number of bottles of water - Amount drunk per day x Number of days Debbie drank water. In this case, if Debbie had 95 bottles of water initially and drank 15 bottles per day for x days, then the number of bottles of water she would have left after x days is: Number of bottles of water remaining = 95 - (15 x x) So, to find out how many bottles of water Debbie will have left after y days, we just need to substitute the value of x into the equation above: Number of bottles of water remaining = 95 - (15 x y) Now, let's assume that Debbie drank water for x days. Since she drank 15 bottles per day, the total amount of water she drank during those days is: Total amount of water drunk = 15 x x Therefore, the number of bottles of water she will have left after x days is: Number of bottles of water remaining = 95 - (15 x x) Substituting the value of x with the given value of 7, we get: Number of bottles of water remaining = 95 - (15 x 7) = 95 - 105 = -10 bottles of water After 7 days, Debbie will have -10 bottles of water left.
"Response:  If Debbie drank 122 botols of water and 9 bottles of soda per day for x days, then we can calculate how many bottles of soda she will consume in total as follows:

Debbie consumed 122 botols of water per day, so she consumed (122/1000) = 0.122 liters of water per day.
She consumed 9 bottles of soda per day, so she consumed (9/500) = 0.0018 liters of soda per day.
Therefore, Debbie will consume a total of (0.122 + 0.0018) = 0.1238 liters of soda per day.
Since there are 360 botols in a liter, Debbie will consume 360 x 0.1238 = 44.72 botols of soda per day.
So, after x days, Debbie will have consumed 44.72 x = 44.72 botols of soda."
Response:  If Faye has 11 pensils in each of the 14 rows, then she has a total of 11 x 14 = 154 pensils. Therefore, Faye has 154 pensils altogether.
Response:  If Faye places 12 pensils in 3 rows, then she must have placed how many pensils in each row?  To find out, we can divide 12 by 3. So, Faye has placed 4 pensils in each row. Therefore, the number of pensils that Faye placed in each row is 4.
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 bungkus pensil with 24 pensils in each bungkus. Therefore, she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 pensils. Now, we are asked how many rows can Faye make using these pensils. To find out, we need to divide the total number of pensils by the number of pensils in each row. So, if there are n rows, then the number of pensils in each row is 672 / n. Since Faye wants to arrange the pensils in rows, we know that n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the number of rows that Faye can make is 672 / n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
Response:  We know that Faye has 6 boxes of pensils with 14 pensils in each box. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 pensils. However, we are also told that there are 22 pensils in each row. So, if we divide 84 by 22, we get the final answer of 39 rows.
Response:  If Faye has 35 pensils and she wants to arrange them in rows of 5 each, then she will need at least 7 rows (since there are 7 krayons). So, the number of bars that can be made is 7.
Response:  We know that Faye has 4 pensils and 27 krayons in each row. So, if we have n rows, then the total number of pensils will be 4 x n, and the total number of krayons will be 27 x n. Therefore, the answer is 4xn pensils and 27xn krayons.
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 rows of pensils and each row contains 36 pensils. Therefore, the total number of pensils is 7 x 36 = 252 pensils. Now, we need to find out how many different colors of pensils Faye has. Since there are 30 krayons in each row, and since Faye has 7 rows, the total number of krayons she has is 7 x 30 = 210 krayons. So, the answer to the question is 252 pensils (the total number of pensils) + 210 krayons (the total number of krayons).
"Response:  We know that Faye has 31 pensils and 27 krayons in each row. Since there are 11 rows, we have:
Pensils: 31 x 11 = 341 pensils
Krayons: 27 x 11 = 297 krayons
So, Faye has 341 pensils and 297 krayons in total."
Response:  If Faye has 30 pensils and wants to arrange them in rows with 5 pensils in each row, then she can make $ $baris$. To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide the number of pensils by the number of pensils in each row: $\boxed{\text{30 pensils / 5 pensils per row = 6 rows}}$. Therefore, Faye can make 6 rows of 5 pensils each, or 6 barises in total.
Response:  If Faye places 3 pensils in the first row and 3 pensils in the second row, then she has placed a total of 6 pensils (3 + 3). So, there are 6 pensils in each row.
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 pensils and she wants to arrange them in rows of 2 pensils each. So, we need to divide 35 by 2 to find out how many rows can be formed.  Therefore, there are 17 rows (or barises) that Faye can make.
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 sets of pensils and each set contains 6 pensils. Therefore, the total number of pensils owned by Faye is:  Total Number of Pensils = Number of Sets x Number of Pensils in Each Set  Total Number of Pensils = 31 x 6  Total Number of Pensils = 186 pensils
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 rows of pensils and each row contains 71 pensils (including 24 pensils in each row). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pensils as follows: Total Number of Pensils = Number of Rows x Number of Pensils per Row Total Number of Pensils = 30 x 71 Total Number of Pensils = 2130 pensils So, there are 2130 pensils in total that Faye has.
Response:  We know that Faye has 6 pensil warna in each row and 16 rows in total. Therefore, the number of pensil warna Faye has is: 6 x 16 = 96 pensil warna.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students attending it. Since each classroom has 7 benches, we can calculate the total number of benches as follows: Number of benches = Total number of classrooms x Number of benches per classroom = 21 x 7 = 147 benches Now, since all the benches are full, we need to divide the total number of benches by the number of students to find out how many students sit at each bench: Number of students sitting at each bench = Total number of benches / Number of students = 147 / 98 = 15 students Therefore, each bench can accommodate 15 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 84 classes in this school. Then, each class has 118 seats. Therefore, the total number of students who can study at one time is:  Number of classes x Number of seats per class = 84 x 118 = 9360 students. So, there are approximately 9360 students in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes (bilik darjah) and each class has 66 students. Therefore, we need to calculate how many seats or benches are needed for all these students to sit during their field trip. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per bench: 66 students / 6 students per bench = 11 benches. So, we need 11 benches for all the students to sit comfortably during their field trip.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 87 classrooms in this school. Then, we have 58 students and each class has the same number of students. Therefore, the total number of classes is  $58 \div 87 = 0.67$ classes. Since each class needs two desks, the total number of desks needed is $0.67 \times 2 = 1.34$ desks. So, approximately $1.34$ bas (or tables) are required for the journey.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 classes in total at this school. Then, each class has an equal number of students, which is 120 students in total. Next, since there are 84 desks available per classroom, we can deduce that each student will have approximately 1.03 (84/8) seats to sit on during lessons. Therefore, the approximate number of students in each class is 120 / 1.03 = 117 students. So, there are around 117 students in each class.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students will go for the field trip. Since there are 102 students in total and each class has 8 students, then the number of students going for the field trip is: 102 x 8 = 808 students.  Now, let's assume that 22 students do not want to go for the field trip. So, the remaining number of students who can go for the field trip is: 808 - 22 = 786 students. Therefore, the number of buses needed for the field trip is: 786 / 8 = 98 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms and 11 students in total. If 8 students do not want to go for the field trip, then we have 94 remaining students (102 - 8 = 94). Now, let's calculate how many students will be going for the field trip based on the available seats (99 x 11 = 1099) : So, out of 94 students, 1099 will be going for the field trip.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 72 classes in this school and each class has 3 desks, so the total number of desks is 72 x 3 = 216 desks. Now, we need to find out how many bases (or groups) are needed for the students to travel. Since there are 111 students in the school, we can divide them equally among the bases, which means each base will have approximately 111/72 = 1.58 students. So, we need at least 1 base (or group) for every 1.58 students. Therefore, the minimum number of bases required is 1 + (1.58 x 72) = 49 bases.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are going for the field trip. From the question, we know that there are 92 students in total. Then, we need to divide this number by the number of classes (46). So, the number of students per class is:  $92 \div 46 = 2$ Students per class Now, each class has a certain number of seats available. We don't know exactly how many seats are available in each class, but we do know that there are 17 departments in total. Therefore, the number of seats available in each department is: $17 \div 46 = 0.375$ seats per class Since there are $2$ students per class, and $0.375$ seats per class, we can calculate the total number of seats available for all $46$ classes as follows: $Total \ spaces = (2 \times 46) \times 0.375 = 16.8$ seats Total number of seats available for all $46$ classes = $16.8$ seats So, if all basis are full, then there will be approximately $16.8$ seats available for each class.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in class Haley and each boy likes to play soccer, then the total number of boys who like playing soccer is 11.  Now, if Haley gives 9 marbles to each boy who likes playing soccer, then the total number of marbles given out is 9 x 11 = 99 marbles. Therefore, Haley has 99 - 9 = 89 marbles left.
Response:  If there are 5 boys in class Haley and each boy gets 5 marbles from Haley, then the total number of marbles given out is 5 x 5 = 25 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  If there are 4 boys in class Haley and they want to share 15 marbles equally among themselves, then each boy will get 15/4 = 3.75 marbles. Since we can't divide a marble into half or quarter, we round up the number of marbles each boy gets to the nearest whole number. So, each boy will receive 4 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing soccer and 50 boys who like playing cards, then we have a total of 63 boys in the class (13 + 50 = 63). Since each boy will receive 26 marbles, the total number of marbles that all the boys will receive is:  Total number of marbles = Number of boys x Marbles per boy = 63 x 26 = 1648 marbles. Therefore, each boy will receive approximately 26 marbles.
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and there are 5 boys in her class who like to play with balls, then each boy will receive an equal number of marbles from Haley. Therefore, the number of marbles that each boy will receive is 20 / 5 = 4 marbles per boy.
Response:  If there are 28 male students in class Haley and she gives 2 marbles to each of them, then the total number of marbles given is:  Number of male students x Number of marbles given per student = 28 x 2 = 56 marbles. Therefore, there are 56 marbles given by Haley to the male students in class Haley.
Response:  If Frank is reading 14 pages per day and there are 392 pages in total, then he will take X days to finish the book. We can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily pages read Where X = Total number of pages / 14 (daily pages read) Substituting the values we get: X = 392 / 14 = 27 So Frank will take 27 days to finish the book.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and takes 569 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages read per day So, in this case, we have: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12380 pages Now, we need to convert the number of pages from decimal format to whole numbers. Since there are 10 decimals in the calculation, let's round off the result to the nearest integer. For example, if we have 12.3456789, we would round it off to 12. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is approximately 12,380 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, the number of pages he read per day is:  Number of pages = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish reading the book  In this case, the total number of pages is 612, and the time taken to finish reading the book is 6 days. So, we can calculate the number of pages Frank read per day as follows:  Number of pages/day = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish reading the book  Number of pages/day = 612 / 6  Number of pages/day = 102 pages/day  Therefore, Frank read approximately 102 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book. If there are 5 bab in total, then each bab must have taken him approximately 44 days (220/5 = 44). Now, let's calculate how many pages were in each bab. Since the book had 555 pages in total, and Frank finished all 5 bab, then each bab must have contained an average of 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111). Therefore, the number of pages in each bab is 111 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his book. Since there are 15 chapters in the book, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows: Number of days = Total number of days / Number of chapters So, the number of days Frank spent reading each chapter is: 660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days per chapter Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per day: Page number = Chapter length x Days spent reading Each chapter has 193 pages, so if Frank reads one chapter per day, he will cover 193 pages per day. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per day is: Pages read per day = Page number / Days spent reading = 193 pages / 44 days = 4.3 pages per day Conclusion: Based on the calculation above, Frank read approximately 4.3 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank takes 3 days to finish each book. Therefore, he reads $ \text {number of books} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3\text{ times the number of books}$ pages in total. Since each book has 249 pages, the total number of pages Frank reads is $\boxed{\text{Total pages}} = 3 \times \boxed{\text{Number of books}} \times 249$. So, the number of pages Frank reads per day is $\boxed{\text{Pages read per day}} = \frac{\boxed{\text{Total pages}}}{\boxed{\text{Days taken}}}$. Substituting the values given in the question, we get $\boxed{\text{Pages read per day}} = \frac{3 \times \boxed{\text{Number of books}}} {3} \times 249 = 767$. Therefore, Frank reads approximately $767$ pages per day.
Response:  If Frank takes 12 days to finish each book and he is currently reading several books, then the number of books he can read in one day is: Number of books = Total time taken for all books / Time taken to finish one book  In this case, the total time taken for all books is given as 492 days, so we can plug it into the formula above: Number of books = 492 days / 12 days per book  Number of books = 40 books Therefore, Frank can read 40 books in one day.
Response:  If Frank takes 16 days to finish reading his book, then he reads at most $ \frac{16}{1} = 16$ pages per day. Since there are 112 pages in the book, Frank reads at most $\frac{16 \times 112}{1} = 1840$ pages in total. Therefore, he reads approximately $1840$ pages in $16$ days.
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total, then he will take X days to finish reading the book. We can write an equation based on this information: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily pages read Where X is the unknown variable that represents the number of days taken by Frank to finish reading the book Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 576 / 8 = 72 days So, Frank takes 72 days to finish reading the book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank took 30 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, he read for x number of hours per day, where x is the number of days taken to finish the book. Since each chapter has 450 pages and there are 41 chapters in total, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read per day as follows: Page count = Number of chapters x Page length (per chapter) Total page count = x x 450 (per chapter) Now, we need to find out how many hours Frank spent reading per day. We know that he finished reading the book in 30 days, so the total number of hours he spent reading is equal to the total number of pages he read divided by the time taken to read them: Hour count = Total page count / Time taken to read Total hour count = Total page count / 30 (days) Substituting the values we have obtained, we get: Hour count =  Total page count / 30 (days) =  Total page count / 30 x 24 (hours/day) = Total page count / 720 (hours) So, Frank read approximately 720 pages or 720 hours worth of content every day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish reading his book. This means he read at a constant rate throughout the time. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages in the book / Time taken to finish the book In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 594 = 1782 pages. So, if Frank finished the book in 607 days, he read approximately 1782 pages/607 days = 29 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his book. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Number of pages = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish the book
= 1078 pages (total number of pages in the book) / 664 days
= 16 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 16 pages per day."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 peks in total. Therefore, if one pek costs $120, then the cost of 6 peks is $120 x 6 = $720. So, the cost per pek is $720 / 6 = $120 per pek.
Response:  If each pack of 81 dollars buys 33 peks of DVD, then we can calculate how much one peck of DVD costs as follows: $ 81 / 33 = $2.57 per peck. Therefore, if John wants to buy 33 pecks of DVD, he will need to spend $2.57 x 33 = $84.11.
Response:  If each DVD costs $107, then buying 5 DVDs would cost $535 ($107 x 5).  Now, if there is a discount of $106 for each DVD, then the new price of each DVD after the discount would be $91 ($106 - $107).  So, to find out how many DVDs you can buy with $93, we need to divide the amount available ($93) by the new price per DVD ($91): Number of DVDs = $93 / $91 = 10 DVDs. Therefore, you can buy 10 DVDs with $93.
Response:  If each DVD costs $76, then if there is a discount of $25 for each pack of 4 DVDs, we need to calculate how much we have to pay for each pack of 4 DVDs. So, let's divide $76 by $25 to get the number of packs that we can buy with one dollar: $$ \frac {76} {25} = 3 $$ Therefore, we can buy 3 packs of 4 DVDs with one dollar.
"Response:  If there are 104 dollars available for buying DVDs and each DVD costs $26, then we can calculate how many DVDs can be bought as follows:

$104 / $26 = 4

So, you can buy 4 DVDs with $104."
"Response:  If $28 is the total cost of buying 2 pek (DVD) and there are 2 pek in each pack, then we can calculate the price per pek as follows:
Price per pek = Total cost / Number of pek
= $28 / 2
= $14 per pek"
"Response:  We know that there are 18 pieces of banana in Philip's collection. If we divide them into groups of size 2, then how many groups can we make?

$$ \begin{aligned} 18 &= 2 \times x \\ x &= 9 \end{aligned}$$

So, there are 9 groups of 2 bananas each."
"Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of size 187 in Philip's collection of bananas. So, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group and then multiply it by the number of groups to get the total number of bananas in the collection.  To do this, let's assume that each group contains x bananas. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

x + (x - 1) + (x - 2) +... + 1 = 140

Now, let's solve for x using substitution or elimination method. Since we have more than one variable, let's use substitution method here. Solving for x, we get:

x = 187

So, each group of bananas contains 187 bananas. Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the collection:

Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Number of bananas per group
= 140 x 187
= 23,690

Therefore, there are approximately 23,690 bananas in Philip's collection of bananas."
Response:  We have 203 pieces of bananas and 63 pieces of oranges in Philip's collection.  If we divide the bananas into 7 groups, each group will contain how many bananas?  To find out, we can use division.  So, if we divide 203 bananas by 7, we get 29 (banana per group). Now, let's move on to the oranges. If we divide the oranges into 95 groups, each group will contain how many oranges? Again, we can use division. So, if we divide 63 oranges by 95, we get 0.66 (orange per group). Therefore, the size of each group is 29 for bananas and 0.66 for oranges.
Response:  We have 142 pieces of bananas and 356 oranges in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into 47 groups, each group will contain 142/47 = 3 bananas. Similarly, if we divide the oranges into 178 groups, each group will contain 356/178 = 2 oranges. Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is 3, and the number of oranges in each group is 2.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Therefore, the total number of bananas is 196 x 392 = 78,048. So, each group contains 392 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 collections of bananas in Philip's collection.  Each collection contains 180 bananas. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of collections = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per collection So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of collections = 180 / 18 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 collections of bananas in Philip's collection.
Response:  We have 87 bunches of bananas and 290 bunches of pineapples in Philip's collection. If we divide the pineapples into two groups, each group will contain how many bunches of pineapples?  For this part, let's use the number 146 as the total number of bunches of pineapples divided between the two groups (since 146 is a common multiple of 2 and 93). So, if we divide the pineapples equally between the two groups, Group A will have 146/2 = 73 bunches of pineapples, and Group B will have 146 - 73 = 73 bunches of pineapples. Now, if we divide the bananas equally among the 93 groups of pineapples, each group will receive how many bananas?  For this part, let's use the number 9 as the total number of bananas distributed among all 93 groups (since 9 is a small prime number that can be easily divided by 93 without leaving a remainder). So, each group will receive 9 / 93 = 0.1009082055078125 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 bananas and 192 apples in Philip's collection. If we divide the apples into 345 groups of equal size, each group will contain 345/3 = 115 apples. Similarly, if we divide the bananas into 16 groups of equal size, each group will contain 384/16 = 24 bananas. So, the number of bananas in each group is 24, and the number of apples in each group is 115.
Response:  If Brenda provides 38 cookies and each cookie has 19 pieces (keks), then we need to find out how many total pieces of cookies are provided. We can do this by multiplying the number of cookies with the number of pieces in each cookie:  Number of pieces = Total number of cookies x Number of pieces per cookie  In this case, the total number of cookies is 38, so we multiply it by the number of pieces per cookie (19):  Number of pieces = 38 x 19 = 702 pieces So, there are 702 pieces of cookies provided for the guests.
Response:  If Brenda makes biscuits for 14 people and each person has 30 cookies, then we can calculate how many cookies Brenda needs to make as follows: Number of cookies = Total number of people x Number of cookies per person = 14 x 30 = 420 cookies So, Brenda needs to make 420 cookies in total.
Response:  If Brenda provides 22 biscuits and ends up throwing away 17 of them, that means she has 5 biscuits left. Now, let's assume each person gets an equal number of biscuits. So, if there are 5 people in total, each person will get 5/5 = 1 biscuit. Therefore, each person will have 1 biscuit.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 biscuits and 9 guests did not come, then each of the remaining 2 guests received how many biscuits?  We know that there are 2 guests in total who came to the party, so they together received 2 x 18 = 36 biscuits. Therefore, each guest received 36 / 2 = 18 biscuits.
Response:  If Brenda makes 14 biscuits for 2 guests and each guest has an equal amount of cookies (since they are sharing), then the number of cookies each guest gets is half of the total number of biscuits made. So, if Brenda makes 14 biscuits, each guest will get 7 cookies (half of 14). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If each guest eats 2 biscuits per visit, and Brenda provides 10 biscuits for her guests, then we can calculate how many visits it will take to consume all 10 biscuits as follows: Number of visits = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits consumed per visit = 10 biscuits / 2 biscuits per visit = 5 visits Therefore, Brenda will provide biscuits for 5 visits.
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and wants to put them in 2 groups of equal size, we can start by dividing them into half. So, he will have 21 pieces of candy in each group.
Response:  If Frank has 26 bags of sugar and each bag contains 33 pieces of sugar, then the total number of pieces of sugar that Frank has is:  Number of bags = 26 Bag size = 33 pieces per bag Total number of pieces = Number of bags x Bag size = 26 x 33 = 840 pieces of sugar. Therefore, there are 840 pieces of sugar in total.
Response:  If Frank has 33 pieces of candy and loses 24 of them, he will have 9 pieces left. Now, if he puts these remaining pieces in a bag with 9 pieces in each bag (a total of 9 x 3 = 27 pieces), how many bags does he have? So, the answer is 27 bags.
Response:  If Frank has 11 pieces of candy in each bag and he has 22 bags, then the total number of candies he has is:  Number of bags = 22 x 11 = 242 candies So, there are 242 candies in total.
Response:  If Frank has 8 gula-gulas in one bag and he wants to distribute them equally among 2 bags, then each bag will have 4 gula-gulas (8/2 = 4). Now, if he has 16 gula-gulas in total, then there are 4 gula-gulas in each of the 2 bags (16 / 2 = 4). So, the number of gula-gulas in each bag is 4.
Response:  If Shirley has 25 packets of marigolds and each packet contains 14 marigold flowers, then she needs to send 25 x 14 = 350 boxes of marigolds in total.
Response:  If Shirley sells 10 Kotak Trefoil and needs to deliver 5 sets of boxes, then we need to divide 10 by 5. So, the number of boxes in each set is 10 / 5 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 boxes in each set that Shirley delivers.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 67 + 9 = 76. Now we need to find out how many bottles of regular soda there are compared to diet soda. So, let's divide the total number of bottles of regular soda (67) by the total number of bottles of diet soda (9): 67 / 9 = 7.5. Therefore, there are approximately 7.5 times more bottles of regular soda than diet soda at this convenience store.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 83 (22 regular + 61 diet). So, to find out how many diet sodas they have, we can divide the number of diet bottles by the total number of bottles:  Number of diet sodas = 61 / 83 = 7  Therefore, the kiosk has 7 bottles of diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda. Therefore, the total number of bottles is 30 + 8 = 38. Additionally, we have 41 epal bottles. So, in total, they have 38 bottles of soda and 41 epal bottles.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 79 + 53 + 42 = 164. Now we need to find out how many bottles of regular soda they have compared to diet soda. So, the ratio of regular soda to diet soda is 79 / (53 + 42) = 79/95 = 0.83. Therefore, there are 83% or 0.83 times as many bottles of regular soda as there are bottles of diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of regular soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. So, we have:
Regular soda = 54 + 83 = 137 bottles
Now, let's find out how many bottles of regular soda they have compared to diet soda:
Diet soda = 12 bottles / 137 bottles = 0.09 (or approximately 9%)
So, for every 100 bottles of regular soda, they have about 9 bottles of diet soda."
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles in total and 9 of them are regular soda bottles. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they have 8 bottles of diet soda.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 25 (19 Diet + 60 Regular). Now we need to find out how many regular bottles there are. Since there are 60 regular bottles, we can say that the ratio of regular to diet bottles is 60:19 = 3:1. So for every one diet bottle, there are three regular bottles. Therefore, if they have 19 diet bottles, they have 19 x 3 = 57 regular bottles.
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 72 + 32 = 104 bottles. Now we need to find out how many more bottles of soda are ""epal"" than regular soda. So, let's subtract the number of regular soda bottles (32) from the total number of bottles: 104 - 32 = 72. Therefore, there are 72 additional bottles of ""epal"" soda compared to regular soda."
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 36 + 54 = 90 bottles. Now we need to find out how many more diet soda bottles there are compared to regular soda bottles. So, let's divide the number of diet soda bottles (54) by the total number of bottles (90):  Number of diet soda bottles / Total number of bottles = 54/90 = 0.6 x 100 = 60%  Therefore, the ratio of diet soda bottles to regular soda bottles is 60%.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 30 and out of those, 28 are regular soda bottles. So, we have to find out how many Diet Soda bottles they have.  Therefore, the number of Diet Soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of Regular Soda bottles  = 30 - 28  = 2  So, there are 2 Diet Soda bottles in the store.
Response:  If they have 4 bottles of diet soda and their total stock is 79 bottles of regular soda, then we can find out how many bottles of regular soda they have by dividing the number of bottles of diet soda by 2 (since each bottle of diet soda represents two regular bottles). So, if they have 4 bottles of diet soda, that means they have 4 x 2 = 8 bottles of regular soda. Therefore, they have 79 - 8 = 71 bottles of regular soda.
Response:  We know that there are 57 bottles of regular soda and 26 bottles of diet soda. So, in total, they have 83 bottles of soda (57 + 26). Now, we need to find out how many bottles of light soda they have. According to the question, they have 27 bottles of light soda. Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda that the store has is 83 + 27 = 110 bottles.
Response:  The total number of bottles of soda that the convenience store has is 81 + 60 + 60 = 201 bottles. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of regular soda they have compared to diet soda and light soda. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is 60 / (60 + 60) = 60/120 = 0.5 or  half. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda is 50 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 49 bottles of soda in total. From this, we can see that there are 40 bottles of regular soda and 6 bottles of light soda. So, to find out how many bottles of each type of soda there are, we can divide the number of bottles of each type by the total number of bottles.  For regular soda, we have:  Number of bottles = 40 / 49 = 0.82 or approximately 82%  For light soda, we have:  Number of bottles = 6 / 49 = 0.12 or approximately 12%
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day and 295 visitors the previous day, we can calculate the percentage increase in visitors as follows: Percentage Increase = (New Visitors - Old Visitors) / Old Visitors x 100 Percentage Increase = (317 - 295) / 295 x 100 = 8% So, there was an 8% increase in visitors to Buckingham Palace between the two days.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the palace yesterday and today is the 25th day after that, then we can calculate the total number of visitors during those 25 days as follows: Total Number of Visitors = Daily Average x Number of Days Total Number of Visitors = 246 x 25 Total Number of Visitors = 6,150 visitors  Therefore, in the past 25 days, approximately 6,150 people have visited the palace.
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before, and 666 visitors came on that particular day, then we can calculate the increase in visitors as follows:

Increase = (Number of visitors on that day - Number of visitors the day before) / Number of visitors the day before
= (666 - 100) / 100
= 566%
Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace increased by 566% compared to the previous day."
Response:  If 132 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday and there were 327 days before that, then we can calculate the number of visitors as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of days x Average number of visitors per day  Here, the total number of days is 327, and the average number of visitors per day is 132 / 327 = 0.40 (or 40%) So, if 40% of the people who visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday had been there previously, then the number of visitors to the palace on the previous day would be: Number of visitors = Total number of days x Average number of visitors per day x Percentage of repeat visitors  Here, the total number of days is still 327, and the average number of visitors per day remains the same at 0.40 (or 40%). Now, let's apply this percentage to the total number of visitors from the previous day: Number of visitors = 327 x 0.40 = 130.80 visitors So, approximately 131 visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.
Response:  If 45 people visited the palace yesterday and there are 829 visitors in total over 85 days ago, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows: Average daily visitors = Total visitors / Number of days  Average daily visitors = 829 / 85 = 9.76 visitors per day Now, let's apply this calculation to today's scenario: Today, 829 people visited the palace, which means that the average number of visitors per day is still 9.76 visitors per day. Therefore, the answer is (9.76 x 100) = 976 visitors per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 71 paintings in the palace and Rachel knows that 557 visitors came to the palace on that day. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of paintings x Visitors per painting On solving for ""visitors,"" we get: Visitors = 71 x 557 = 39,677 visitors visited the palace in 57 days. Therefore, the answer is 39,677."
Response:  We know that there are 39 paintings in the palace and Rachel knows 661 people visited the palace on the day she went. So, we can assume that the total number of visitors to the palace on that day is at least 39 + 661 = 700. Now, let's compare this with the previous day when Rachel knew 600 people visited the palace. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on the two days is 700 - 600 = 100 more visitors on the second day compared to the first day.
Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to the palace on the day in question. If we subtract this number from the total number of visitors for the previous two days (419 + 103 = 522), then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Average daily visitors = Total visitors / Number of days = 522 / 3 = 174  Therefore, there were approximately 174 people visiting the palace each day before the day in question.
Response:  We know that there were 512 visitors to the palace yesterday (Rachel knows this). So, if we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (which is given as 471), we get the difference between the two days: 512 - 471 = 41. Therefore, there were 41 more visitors to the palace yesterday than there were on the previous day. Now, let's find out how many people visited the palace in total over the past 89 days:  Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday x Number of days ago +... + Number of visitors 89 days ago = 512 x 89 + 471 + 808 = 36,873 + 471 = 37,344 visitors Total visitors over the past 89 days = 37,344 visitors
Response:  On the day in question (Day X), there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace.  If we compare this with the previous day (Day Y), where there were 191 visitors, then the increase in visitors is 314 (705 - 191 = 314).  Now, if we compare Day X with two days before that (Day Z), where there were 457 visitors, then the increase from Day Z to Day X is 268 (705 - 457 = 268). Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace increased by 268 visitors between Day Z and Day X.
Response:  We know that the total amount of glue needed is 159 grams more than the weight of the feathers. So, if the weight of the feathers is x grams, then we need 159 +x grams of glue. Now, we are given that the weight of the feathers is 628 grams. Therefore, we can calculate the number of grams of glue needed as follows:  Gram of glue = (159 + x) - 628 grams  Substituting x = 628 grams into the equation above, we get:  Gram of glue = (159 + 628) - 628 grams  = 907 grams  Therefore, there are 907 grams of glue needed to attach the feathers.
Response:  If we assume that the amount of paint needed to attach the feathers is 49 grams per feather (as stated in the question), then the total amount of paint needed for all 10 feathers would be: 49 grams x 10 feathers = 490 grams. Now, if the current amount of paint available is 260 grams (as mentioned in the question), then the remaining amount of paint needed to complete the task would be: 490 grams - 260 grams = 230 grams. Therefore, the answer is 230 grams.
Response:  We know that the total amount of paint needed is 57 grams and we have 22 grams left over after painting all the feathers. So, the total amount of paint used for painting all the feathers is 57 + 22 = 79 grams. Now, let's calculate how much lint (or down) is required to fill each feather. According to the problem, there are 353 grams of lint in total, and since we need 79 grams of paint, it means that there are 353 - 79 = 274 grams of lint left over after painting all the feathers. Therefore, if Bulu needs 353 grams of lint, then she has 274 grams of lint left over after painting all her feathers.
"Response:  If Setia needs 166 grams of glue to attach all her eyelashes and she currently has 20 grams left, then we can calculate how much more glue she needs as follows:

Required amount = Total amount needed - Amount already available
= 166 g - 20 g
= 146 g

Therefore, Setia needs an additional 146 grams of glue to complete the task."
"Response:  If she has 557 grams of glue and now needs only 17 grams, then we can calculate how much glue is left as follows:
Glue remaining = Total amount of glue - Amount needed
= 557 grams - 17 grams
= 539 grams
Therefore, there are 539 grams of glue left."
Response:  If Setia has currently 11 grams of glue and needs 492 grams more to stick all her feathers together, then we can calculate how many feathers she has as follows:  Number of feathers = Amount of glue / Amount of glue needed per feather  In this case, the amount of glue needed per feather is 492 grams, so we can plug in these values into the equation:  Number of feathers = 11 g / 492 g/feather  Number of feathers = 0.023 feathers  Therefore, Setia has approximately 23 feathers.
Response:  If there are 94 people filling up 90 bunches of grapes in 6 days, we can calculate the number of bunches filled each day as follows: Number of bunches filled/Number of days = Total number of bunches filled / Total number of days  In this case, the total number of days is 6 days, and the total number of bunches filled is 90 bunches. Therefore, the number of bunches filled each day is: 90/6 = 15 bunches per day So, the answer to the question is 15 bunches.
Response:  If there are 266 pickers and they need to fill 90 bunches of grapes in 5 days, we can calculate the number of bunches that each picker needs to fill per day as follows: Number of pickers = 266 Total amount of grapes needed = 90 Bunches per day = Total amount of grapes needed / Number of pickers = 90 / 266 = 3.47 bunches per day Now, let's convert this value to tongs (which is equivalent to bunches). Since one bunch contains approximately 10-12 kg of grapes, we can estimate that one tong contains around 30-36 kg of grapes. Therefore, the number of tongs filled per day would be: Tongs filled per day = Bunches filled per day x Weight of one bunch = 3.47 x 10-12 kg/bunch = 34.7 - 36.8 tongs per day So, based on these calculations, the answer to the question is approximately 34.7 - 36.8 tongs filled per day.
"Response:  If there are 244 tongs of grape juice filled every day and each tong can hold 470 milliliter (mL) of liquid, then the total volume of grape juice filled daily is:

$$ Volume = Number \times Capacity $$

$$= 244 \times 470$$

$$= 113,880 mL$$

Now, let's calculate how many tongs will be filled in 146 days:

$$ Total Volume = Daily Volume x Number of Days $$

$$= 113,880 \times 146$$

$$= 16,577,600 mL$$

So, there will be approximately 16,577,600 milliliters of grape juice filled in 146 days."
Response:  If there are 235 people filling up 100 tongs of raspberry juice every day and 221 people filling up 100 tongs of grape juice every day, then in total, there are 235 + 221 = 456 people filling up juice every day.  Now, if they continue to fill up juice for 77 days, then the total number of tongs filled with grape juice would be 456 x 77 = 34,890 tongs.
Response:  If there are 108 tong anggur filled every day and Menjai takes 57 days to finish them all, then we can calculate how many tong anggur he fills per day as follows: Number of tong anggur filled per day = Total number of tong anggur / Time taken to fill them (in days) = 108 / 57 = 1.96 tong anggur per day Now, if it takes Menjai 58 days to finish all the tong anggur, then he will fill additional one tong anggur beyond what he normally fills in a day, i.e., 1 + 1.96 = 3.96 tong anggur per day. Therefore, the answer is 3 tong anggur and 96 tong anggur.
Response:  If it takes 36 workers 8 hours to fill 8 tongs of grapes, then it will take how many workers 1 day (24 hours) to fill 240 tongs of grapes?  To find out, we can divide the total number of tongs by the number of workers and their work time per day:  Number of workers = Total number of tongs / Workers' work time per day  In this case, the total number of tongs is 240, and the workers' work time per day is 8 hours. So, we can calculate as follows:  Number of workers = 240 / 8  = 30 workers  Therefore, it will take 30 workers 1 day (24 hours) to fill 240 tongs of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has an equal number of fish (52). So, we can write this as:  Number of fish in one aquarium = Total number of fish / Number of aquariums  In this case, the total number of fish is 52, and the number of aquariums is 26. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the number of fish in each aquarium:  Number of fish in one aquarium = 52 / 26 = 2  So, there are 2 fish in each aquarium.
Response:  If Dia has 40 ekor (tails) of fish in her aquarium that are different, and each aquarium contains 2 fish, then...  How many aquariums does she have?  We can use multiplication to solve this problem!  So, if Dia has 40 ekor of fish and each aquarium contains 2 fish, then...  Number of aquariums = Total number of fish / Number of fish per aquarium  Number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums!  Therefore, Dia has 20 aquariums with fish in them.
Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for freshwater fish and 10 aquariums for saltwater fish. Each aquarium has 39 fish inside it. So, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows:  Total number of freshwater fish = Number of aquariums x Number of fish in each aquarium = 56 x 39 = 2174 fish Total number of saltwater fish = Number of aquariums x Number of fish in each aquarium = 10 x 39 = 390 fish Therefore, there are 2174 freshwater fish and 390 saltwater fish in Tyler's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for marine animals. Each aquarium has 46 animals inside it. So, we can calculate the total number of animals as follows: Total number of freshwater animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Total number of marine animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of freshwater animals = 74 x 46 = 3380 Total number of marine animals = 22 x 46 = 952 Therefore, there are 3380 freshwater animals and 952 marine animals in Tyler's home.
Response:  We know that Dia has 15 aquariums for freshwater fish and 62 aquariums for saltwater fish. Each aquarium contains 19 fish inside it. So, we can calculate the total number of fish as follows: Freshwater Fish = 15 x 19 = 285 Saltwater Fish = 62 x 19 = 1,178 Total Number of Fish = 285 + 1,178 = 1,463 Therefore, there are 1,463 fish in total in Dia's aquariums.
Response:  If one t-shirt costs RM 13, then three t-shirts will cost 3 x RM 13 = RM 39.  Therefore, if the mother buys 39 white shirts, she will have 39 / 1 = 39 pakejs.
Response:  If an mother buys 66 white t-shirts and each package contains 3 white t-shirts, then we can find out how many packages she will be able to buy as follows: Number of packages = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts in each package = 66 / 3 = 22 packages So, the mother will be able to buy 22 packages of white t-shirts.
Response:  If an mother buys 28 boxes of white T-shirts that contain 56 white T-shirts in total, then we can find out how many white T-shirts are in each box as follows: Number of white T-shirts per box = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of boxes = 56 / 28 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 white T-shirts in each box.
Response:  If Ibu buys 57 packs of white t-shirts and she has already bought 34 packs, then the total number of white t-shirts that Ibu will have is: Total = Number of packs x Number of shirts per pack = 57 x 6 = 342 shirts So, there are 342 white t-shirts in total.
Response:  If she buys 51 white T-shirts, and each T-shirt comes in three packages, then we can calculate how many packages there are as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of T-shirts / Number of T-shirts per package  In this case, the total number of T-shirts is 51, and since each T-shirt comes in three packages, we divide 51 by 3 to get the number of packages:  Number of packages = 51 / 3 = 17 packages So, there are 17 packages of white T-shirts that ibu will buy.
Response:  If ibu buys 70 white shirts and each package contains 14 shirts, then: Number of packages = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts in each package = 70 / 14 = 5 packages So, ibu will buy 5 packages of white shirts.
Response:  If there are 4 big groups (beg) with equal number of keys (kek), then each group has 36 keys in total. So, the number of keys in each big group is 36/4 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 keys in each big group.
Response:  If you have 33 biscuits and each pack contains 11 biscuits, then: Number of packs = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits in each pack = 33 / 11 = 3 packs So, you have 3 packs of biscuits.
Response:  If each bee has 41 biscuits and you have 53 bees, then the total number of biscuits that you will have is: Total number of biscuits = Number of bees x Number of biscuits per bee Total number of biscuits = 53 x 41 = 2190 biscuits So, you will have 2190 biscuits in total.
Response:  If we have 14 biscuits in total and each bag contains 7 biscuits with the same amount of biscuits as the total number of biscuits available, then the number of bags is equal to the total number of biscuits divided by the number of biscuits in each bag. So, if we divide 14 (total number of biscuits) by 7 (number of biscuits in each bag), we get the answer 2 (bags). Therefore, there are 2 bags containing 7 biscuits each.
Response:  If each bag contains 3 biscuits and you have 21 biscuits in total, then the number of bags you have is: Number of bags = Total number of biscuits / Number of biscuits per bag = 21 biscuits / 3 biscuits per bag = 7 bags. Therefore, you have 7 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If I have 15 gula-gulas and 52 biskuts, then the total number of beg (small units) is:  Number of gula-gulas x Number of small units per gula = 15 x 4 = 60 Small units. Now, we need to find out how many big units are in 60 small units. Since there are 4 big units in each small unit, we can write: Big units = Small units / 4 = 60 / 4 = 15 Big units. Therefore, if I have 15 gula-gulas and 52 biskuts, I will have 15 big units of biskuts.
Response:  We know that there are 14 beggies with equal number of cookies (28) and candies (86). So we can represent this situation as follows: Beggie #1 has 28 cookies and 86 candies, Beggie #2 has 28 cookies and 86 candies,..., Beggie #14 has 28 cookies and 86 candies. Now let's calculate how many biscuits each beggie has in total: For each beggie, we have 28 cookies x 14 beggies = 352 cookies Total amount of cookies for all beggies = 352 cookies + 86 candies = 438 Total amount of sweets for all beggies = 438 sweets Now, to find out how many biscuits you have overall, we need to add up the number of biscuits from each beggie: Total number of biscuits = 352 cookies / 14 beggies = 25 per beggie Total number of biscuits = 25 x 14 = 350 biscuits Therefore, if you have 28 biscuits, it means you have 350 - 28 = 322 biscuits left over after distributing them among the 14 beggies.
Response:  If there are x houses in each block and he needs to deliver 5 pieces of trash to each house, then...  So, if we divide x by 5, we get...  Therefore, the number of houses in each block is...
Response:  If there are 20 houses in one block and each house needs 9 pieces of trash mail, then the total number of pieces of trash mail that need to be delivered is:  20 houses x 9 pieces/house = 180 pieces of trash mail.
Response:  If there are 6 houses in one block and each house needs 24 pieces of trash mail, then we need to calculate how many pieces of trash mail must be given to each house.  Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash mail that must be given is 6 x 24 = 144 pieces of trash mail.
Response:  If one tukang pos provides 14 pieces of trash to each house in a block, and he needs to provide 2 pieces of trash to each block, then we can calculate as follows: Number of houses in a block = Total number of pieces of trash provided / Number of pieces of trash needed for each block = 14 x (Number of blocks) / 2 = 70 houses in each block. Therefore, there are 70 houses in each block.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in one block and each house needs 32 pieces of trash mail, then the total number of pieces of trash mail needed for all blocks is:  20 x 32 = 640 pieces of trash mail. Therefore, the tukang pos (mailman) will need to deliver 640 pieces of trash mail to all the blocks combined.
Response:  If there are 30 pieces of trash to be delivered and there are 19 houses in one block, then we need to divide 30 by 19 to find out how many pieces of trash each house will receive. So, the answer is 1.6 (30/19).
Response:  If there are 55 blocks and each block has 8 houses, then the total number of houses is 55 x 8 = 440 houses.  If the postman delivers 32 letters to each house, then he will deliver a total of 440 x 32 = 13,760 letters in total.
Response:  If there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, then the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 972 houses. Since the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of trash to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 972 x 4 = 3888 pieces of trash. Therefore, the answer is 3888.
Response:  If there are 16 blocks and each block has 17 houses, then the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 252 houses. Since the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of trash to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 252 x 4 = 1008 pieces of trash. Therefore, the answer is 1008.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to share her collection of marbles with a group of 4 people, she will have to divide them equally among the four groups. So, each person in the group will get an equal number of marbles from Rebecca.  Now, let's count how many marbles Rebecca has and how many she can give to each group:  Marbles that Rebecca has = 20 marbles Total number of marbles Rebecca can give to each group = Number of groups x Number of marbles per group  In this case, there are 4 groups, so Rebecca can give 4 x 5 = 20 marbles to each group. Therefore, the total number of marbles that Rebecca will give to all the groups is 4 x 20 = 80 marbles.  So, the answer is 80.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs to share among 5 groups. To find out how many marbles each group will get, we can divide the total number of marbles (10) by the number of groups (5): Group 1 will get 2 marbles (10 / 5 = 2), Group 2 will get 4 marbles (10 / 5 = 4), Group 3 will get 6 marbles (10 / 5 = 6), Group 4 will get 8 marbles (10 / 5 = 8), and Group 5 will get 10 marbles (10 / 5 = 2). So, in total, Rebecca will have distributed 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 2 = 20 marbles. Now, let's count the number of eggs she has left after distributing them: 15 - 20 = -5 eggs. Therefore, there will be 5 empty groups or no groups at all.
"Response:  If Rebecca has $X$ eggs and she wants to distribute them equally among $11$ groups, then each group will receive $\frac{X}{11}$ eggs. Since there are $2$ eggs in each group, we can write:
$$\boxed{\frac{X}{11} = 2}$$
Now, we need to find out what value of $X$ satisfies this equation. We can solve for $X$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $11$:
$$\boxed{X = \frac{11}{2}}$$
So, Rebecca has $5$ eggs ($X = 5$)."
Response: 1) Firstly, we need to divide the total number of eggs equally among the four groups. So, if Rebecca has 8 eggs and wants to distribute them equally among 4 groups, each group will get 2 eggs (8/4 = 2). 2) Now, let's consider the marbles. If there are 6 marbles, then each group will also get 1 marble (6/4 = 1). Therefore, each group will have 3 objects in total - 2 eggs and 1 marble.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. She wants to share them equally among 3 groups. So, we need to divide the total number of eggs (15) by the number of groups (3). Therefore, each group will have: Number of eggs per group = Total number of eggs / Number of groups = 15 / 3 = 5 eggs per group.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to share them equally among 6 groups. So each group will get 3 eggs (since 18 / 6 = 3). Now let's count how many pieces of fruit she has:  She has 72 bananas and 66 marbles, so altogether she has 138 pieces of fruit (72 + 66 = 138). Therefore, there will be 138 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 eggs and 27 marbles. If she wants to divide them into three groups, we can assume that each group will contain an equal number of eggs and marbles. So, if we divide 99 eggs equally among 3 groups, each group will have 33 eggs (since 99 / 3 = 33). Similarly, if we divide 27 marbles equally among 3 groups, each group will have 9 marbles (since 27 / 3 = 9). Therefore, there will be 3 groups with 33 eggs and 9 marbles each.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. If she wants to distribute them equally among 5 groups, then each group will get 4 eggs (20 / 5 = 4). So, the number of eggs Rebecca has per marble is 4/6 = 2/3. Therefore, for every 3 marbles, Rebecca has 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and wants to share them equally among 20 people. So, each person will get 1/2 marble (or half of 5). Now, we need to find out how many telur Rebecca has after sharing her marbles with others. According to the question, Rebecca has 12 telur. Therefore, the number of telur Rebecca has left after sharing her marbles is:  Number of telur = Total number of telur - Number of marble shared  Number of telur = 12 - (5 / 20)  Number of telur = 12 - 2.5  Number of telur = 9.5  So, Rebecca has 9.5 telur left after sharing her marbles with others.
Response:  If Luke gets 11 points in each round and he has played 154 rounds, then we can calculate his total score as follows: Total Score = Number of Rounds x Points per Round Total Score = 154 x 11 = 1724 So, Luke scored 1724 points in total.
Response:  If Luke has answered 177 questions correctly and he got 46 points in each question, then the total number of points he scored is:  Total points = Number of correct answers x Points for each correct answer  Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored is:  Total points = 177 x 46 = 8382 points
Response:  If Luke got $84 after playing 2 rounds of trivia and he received the same amount of money each round, then we can calculate his total earnings as follows: Round 1: He earned $84, so he has $0 left. Round 2: He also earned $84, so he now has $0 left again. Therefore, Luke did not collect any money during the second round. So, his total earnings are $0 + $0 = $0.
Response:  If Luke gets 146 points in each game of Trivial Pursuit, and he plays 157 games, then the total number of points he can get is:  Total points = Number of games x Points per game = 157 x 146 = 22,392 points.
Response:  If Luke gets 3 points in each round of the game show and he has played $n$ rounds, then he has gotten a total of $\sum_{i=1}^n 3 \times 9 = 27 \times n$ points so far. Since he has already gotten 78 points, we can find out how many rounds he has played as follows: $$ \frac{78}{27} = \frac{n}{x} $$ where $x$ is the number of rounds Luke has played so far. Solving for $n$, we get $n = x \times 27$. Therefore, Luke has played $n = 27 \times 78 = 1964$ rounds of the game show.
Response:  If Emily has 2 beads and can make 32 pendants, then she must have used each bead to make half of those pendants. So, if she uses 1 bead for half of the pendants, she will need 2 beads to make all of them. Therefore, the number of beads needed per pendant is 2.
Response:  If Emily is making earrings for her friends and she makes 11 pairs of earrings, then she must have used 11 x 28 = 304 manik in total. Therefore, Emily has 304 manik-manik in total.
Response:  If Emily has 16 manik and each Kalung requires 8 manik, then she can make 2 x 8 = 16 Kalungs. So, Emily can make 16 Kalungs.
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 manik and she wants to make 18 kalung. So, we need to divide the number of manik (6) by the number of kalung (18). Therefore, the answer is: 6 / 18 = 0.33 or approximately 1/3. So, for each kalung, Emily needs about 1/3 of her total number of manik.
Response:  If Emily is making earrings for her friends and each earring takes 5 beads, then she needs 5 x number of earrings = 5 x 4 = 20 beads in total. So, Emily has 20 beads.
Response:  If Emily has 6 manik and each Kalung takes 3 manik, then she can make 6 / 3 = 2 Kalung using all of her manik. So, Emily can make 2 Kalung.
Response:  If Emily has 5 manik and she can make 20 kalung, then we know that each kalung requires 5/20 = 1/4 of a manik. So, to make one kalung, Emily needs 1/4 of a manik. Therefore, to make 43 kalung, Emily needs 43 x 1/4 = 10 7/8 manik.
Response:  If Emily is making earrings for 44 friends and she makes 26 of them, then the number of earrings she has made is equal to 44 - 26 = 18. Since each earring requires 2 manik, the total number of manik that Emily has is 18 x 2 = 36. Therefore, Emily has 36 manik in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 668278 of them stayed at home. So, we need to find out how many more children stayed at home compared to those who went to camp. To do this, we can divide the number of children who stayed at home (668278) by the total number of children (819058). This gives us a ratio of 0.8 or approximately 80%. Therefore, about 80% of the children in Lawrence County spent their summer vacation at home, while the remaining 20% went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 202958 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. To find out how many children stayed at home compared to those who went to camp, we can divide the number of children who stayed at home (777622) by the number of children who went to camp (202958). This gives us a ratio of approximately 3.84 : 1. So for every child who went to camp, there were about 3.84 children who stayed at home.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and during summer vacation, 629424 of them went to camp. So, the number of children who stayed at home is:  Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp  Number of children staying at home = 898051 - 629424  Number of children staying at home = 268627  Therefore, there are 268627 children who stayed at home during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County. During summer vacation, 274,865 of them stay at home and the rest go to camp. So, we can calculate the number of children who go to camp as follows: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children x Percentage of children going to camp (which is not given) Now, we don't have enough information to find out the percentage of children going to camp. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of children who go to camp. However, we can give an estimate based on some assumptions. Suppose the percentage of children going to camp is around 50%. Then, the number of children going to camp would be: Number of children going to camp = 313,473 x 0.5 = 156,736 This means that approximately 156,736 children from Lawrence County go to camp during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children in Lawrence County who stay at home and 455682 children who go to camp. So, we can calculate the total number of children in Lawrence County as follows: Total number of children = Number of children who stay at home + Number of children who go to camp Total number of children = 907611 + 455682 = 1363293 Therefore, there are approximately 1363293 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that out of 828521 children in Lawrence County, 800059 went to camp and the remaining 428462 stayed at home. So, we can calculate the number of children who stay at home as follows: Number of children who stay at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp Number of children who stay at home = 828521 - 800059 328462 Therefore, there are 328462 children who stay at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children from Lawrence County who stay at home and more than that go to camp. The total number of children in Lawrence County is 91676. So, we can calculate the percentage of children who go to camp as follows: Percentage = (Number of children who go to camp / Total number of children) x 100 Number of children who go to camp = 61619 Total number of children = 91676 Now, we have our answer: Percentage = (61619 / 91676) x 100 = 68% Therefore, about 68% of the children in Lawrence County go to camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34044 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 134867 children who stayed at home. Additionally, 424944 children from outside the area attended the camp. Therefore, the total number of children attending the camp is:  Total number of children = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside the area - Number of children from Lawrence County who stayed at home  Total number of children = 34044 + 424944 - 134867  Total number of children = 509855 children Now, let's convert this number into a percentage. To do so, divide the total number of children by the total population of children in the area. Population of children in the area = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside the area  Population of children in the area = 34044 + 424944 = 458388 children So, the percentage of children attending the camp is: Percentage of children attending the camp = Total number of children / Population of children in the area x 100 Percentage of children attending the camp = 509855 / 458388 x 100 Percentage of children attending the camp = 112.5%
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and another 590796 children who stayed at home. So, in total, we have 610769 + 590796 = 1201065 children from Lawrence County. Now, let's consider the number of out-of-district children attending the camp. According to the question, 22 more children from outside the district attended the camp. Therefore, the total number of children from Lawrence County is 1201065 - 22 = 1199843 children.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children from Lawrence County who stay at home and 893835 children who go to camp. So, in total, there are 1538232 children (644997 + 893835). Now, we need to add the number of out-of-district children attending camp, which is 78. Therefore, the total number of children in Lawrence County is 1538900 (1538232 + 78).
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 3 = 9 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 9 - (x + 3) = 6 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 epal and Jackie has 2 epal. To find out how many more epal Adam has than Jackie, we can divide the number of epal that Adam has (10) by the number of epal that Jackie has (2). So, Adam has 5 times as many epal as Jackie. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can divide the number of apples Jackie has (10) by the number of apples Adam has (9). So, the difference between the two is:  10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 5 apples. So, if we divide the number of apples that Jackie has (10) by the number of apples that Adam has (5), we get:  
Jackie has 2 times as many apples as Adam. Therefore, Jackie has 2 x 5 = 10 apples more than Adam."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If they divide them equally among themselves, each of them will get 3 apples (since 6 / 2 = 3). Now, we are told that there are 4 more apples than what Adam and Jackie have together. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 apples. Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 epal together. Then, we are asked how many more epal there are than Adam and Jackie have together. So, if there are 9 epal in total, then the difference between the number of epal Adam and Jackie have and the total number of epal is equal to 2 (since 9 - 7 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 12 epal in total.  Since Adam has 8 more epal than Jackie, we can say that Adam has x epal and Jackie has 12 - x epal.  Now, we are told that Jackie has 9 epal more than the combined number of epal owned by Adam and Jackie. So, we can write an equation as follows:  x + (12 - x) = 9  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 9  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:  x = 4  Therefore, Adam has 4 epal and Jackie has 8 epal.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 4 epal and less than or equal to 10 epal. So, we can say that Adam has between 5 and 10 epal. Now, we also know that Adam and Jackie together have 2 epal less than them. Therefore, the total number of epal they have is 6 - 2 = 4. Since Adam alone has more than 4 epal, he must have at least 5 epal. Thus, Adam has exactly 5 epal.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 5 apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 89 jeruk and 11 epal, then Adam must have at least 90 + 11 = 101 epal. Therefore, Adam has 101 apples.
Response:  If Helen made 31 cookies last night and 419 cookies this morning, then she must have made a total of:  Total number of cookies = Number of cookies last night + Number of cookies this morning  Total number of cookies = 31 + 419 = 450 cookies per day So, Helen makes 450 cookies every day.
Response:  If Helen made 90 kek cip coklat last night and 51 kek kismis this morning, then she has made a total of 90 + 51 = 141 kek cip coklat so far. However, the question also states that Helen plans to make 484 more kek cip coklat today, which means she will have made a total of 141 + 484 = 625 kek cip coklat by the end of the day. Therefore, the answer is 625.
Response:  We know that Helen has already made 86 kek kismis and 554 kek cip coklat this morning. So, we can calculate how many more kek cip coklat she will make based on the total number of kek cip coklat she wants to make for the day (527).  Therefore, the number of kek cip coklat Helen will make is:  Number of kek cip coklat Helen will make = Total number of kek cip coklat wanted - Number of kek kismis already made = 527 - 86 = 441  So, Helen will make 441 kek cip coklat today.
"Response:  We know that Helen has already made 85 kek kismis and 403 kek cip coklat this morning. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of kek kismis = Total number of kek x (Number of kek made today / Total number of kek)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of kek kismis = 144 x (85/403)  Simplifying and solving for ""Number of kek kismis"", we get:  Number of kek kismis = 62  Therefore, Helen has made 62 kek kismis so far today."
Response:  We know that Helen made 19 kek cip coklat last night and 231 kek kismis this morning. So, the total number of keks she made is: 19 + 231 = 250. Now, we are asked how many kek cip coklat Helen made compared to the number of kek kismis she made. To find out, we divide the number of kek cip coklat by the number of kek kismis: 250 (kek cip coklat) / 231 (kek kismis) = 1.06. Therefore, Helen made approximately 1.06 times more kek cip coklat than kek kismis.
Response:  If Helen made 197 cookies yesterday and 46 today, then she has made a total of 243 cookies this week (197 + 46).  Since there are 7 days in a week, Helen has made an average of 33 cookies per day (243 / 7 = 33). So, Helen makes approximately 33 cookies every day.
"Response:  If Helen has already made 280 kek kismis and 359 kek cip coklat today, then she must have started making them at midnight (since she woke up at 6 am). So, let's count how many keks she made each hour:

* Midnight to 6 am: 0 keks (Helen just started)
* 6 am to 12 pm: 280 keks (she made 280 kek kismis during this time)
* 12 pm to 6 pm: 359 keks (she made 359 kek cip coklat during this time)
* 6 pm to present:? keks (we don't know exactly how many more keks Helen made after 6 pm, but we can estimate based on the information given)

Total number of keks Helen made today = 280 + 359 = 639 keks!"
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. So, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games, her new friend has 88 games, and her old friend has 53 games. So we can write an equation: 91 + 88 = x (where x is the number of games owned by the old friend). Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 88 from both sides of the equation: 91 - 88 = x. Simplifying, we get: x = 23. Therefore, the old friend owns 23 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and 86 old games in total.  Of those, her friends have 48 new games. So, we need to find out how many new games Katie has left after giving some to her friends.  To do this, we can subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of new games Katie has: 78 - 48 = 30. Therefore, Katie has 30 new games left after giving some to her friends.
Response:  Katie has 84 games in total, and she plays with her friends for 8 new games. So, Katie has 76 games left (84 - 8 = 76). Now, let's find out how many games her friends have together. They have 19 old games + 8 new games = 27 games. Therefore, Katie and her friends have 76 games + 27 games = 103 games altogether.
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and 80 old games, so together they have 142 games (62 + 80 = 142).  Now, we are told that Katie's friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so together they have 114 games (73 + 41 = 114).  Therefore, there are 28 more games in total than what Katie has (142 - 114 = 28). So, the answer is 28.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 games and her friend has 63 games. So we can calculate the difference between their number of games as follows:  Number of games owned by Katie - Number of games owned by her friend = 57 - 63 = -6  Therefore, Katie has 6 fewer games than her friend.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 games in total and her friends have 34 new games. So, we can calculate the number of old games that Katie has as follows:  Number of old games = Total games - Number of new games  Number of old games = 57 - 34  Number of old games = 23 Therefore, Katie has 23 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $60 and Jason has $19. Then, Jason cleaned his car at the end of the week and now he has $33. So, the total amount of money that Jason made from cleaning his car is $33 - $19 = $14. Therefore, the answer is $14.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. So together they have $91 ($86 + $5). Then, Fred earned $9 more after washing his car at the end of the week, so now he has $100 ($91 + $9). As for Jason, since he didn't work this week, he still has $5. Therefore, the total amount of money that both Fred and Jason have now is $105 ($100 + $5).
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the week, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. After they cleaned their cars at the end of the week, Fred now has $40 and Jason has $69. So, to find out how much money Fred gained this week, we can subtract his initial amount from his new amount: $40 - $19 = $21. Therefore, Fred gained $21 this week.
Response:  We know that at the end of last week, Fred had $114 and Jason had $22. Then they washed their car at the end of the week and now Fred has $21 and Jason has $78. So, to find out how much money Jason made this week, we can subtract what he had before from what he has now: $78 - $22 = $56. Therefore, Jason made $56 this week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 at the beginning of the week and then he earned $4 from washing the car at the end of the week. Therefore, his new amount is $115. Similarly, Jason had $40 at the beginning of the week and now he has $44 after delivering the letter. So, the total amount they earned from washing the car is $79 ($115 - $36).
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $49 and now he has $112 after washing his car at the end of the week. This means that he gained $63 from washing his car. Similarly, Jason had $3 and now he has $63 after delivering the newspaper. Therefore, the amount of money they earned by delivering newspapers is $57 ($63 - $3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $78 and Jason has $31. So, if they send a letter together, they will have a total of $109 ($78 + $31). Now, since Jason gave $14 to someone else, he now has $27 ($31 - $14). As for Fred, he cleaned his car at the end of the week and gained $90. Therefore, the amount of money they earned from sending letters is $90 - $27 = $63.
Response:  Firstly, Fred has $33 and spends $16 on sending a letter. So he now has $33 - $16 = $17 left. Then, he cleans a car for $74. So his total earnings from cleaning the car is $74 + $17 = $91. Therefore, at the end of the week, Fred has $91 + $33 = $124.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 at the beginning of the week and then he received $111 from selling his newspaper. So, now he has $558 ($47 + $111). Next, we know that Jason had $99 at the beginning of the week and then he spent $34 on cleaning his car. Now, Jason has $65 ($99 - $34). Finally, we want to find out how much money Fred has now. We can do this by subtracting what Jason has from what Fred had initially: $558 - $65 = $493. Therefore, Fred currently has $493.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 71 kg initially and lost 20 kg per day, then she would have lost a total of 20 x 5 = 100 kg after 5 days. So her current weight is 71 - 100 = 39 kg.
Response:  Before jogging every day, Jessie weighed 27 kg. After she started jogging, she lost 101 kg. So, her current weight is: 27 kg - (101 kg / 2) = 14 kg. Therefore, before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 14 kg.
Response:  Before she started jogging every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. Now, her weight is 66 kg. So, the difference between her original weight and current weight is 60 kg (126 - 66). Therefore, her original weight before starting to jog was 126 kg.
Response:  Before jogging every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. If she lost 35 kg, her current weight would be: 69 - 35 = 34 kg. So, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg.
Response:  In week one (first week), Jessie lost 50 kg = 50/7 = 7 kg per day. So in total, she lost 7 x 7 = 49 kg during the first week. Now, let's calculate how much weight she lost in the second week:  In week two (second week), Jessie lost 60 kg = 60/7 = 8.57 kg per day. So in total, she lost 8.57 x 7 = 59.73 kg during the second week. Therefore, Jessie's current weight is:  Current weight = Total weight loss in week 2 + Total weight loss in week 1 = 59.73 + 49 = 108.73 kg.
Response:  First week (62 kg lost):  $ \text{Initial weight} = 9 \text{ kg} $  Second week (140 kg lost): $\text{Initial weight} = 9 + (-140) = -51 \text{ kg}$ So, $\text{initial weight} = -51 \text{ kg}$.
Response:  First week (Question 1): Jessie lost 56 kg in one week, so her weight after one week is: $92 - 56 = 36$ kg Second week (Question 2): Jessie lost another 99 kg in one week, so her weight after two weeks is: $36 - 99 = -63$ kg Therefore, Jessie's weight after one week of jogging is $36$ kg.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes and 61 crocodiles in total. If 64 of them are hiding, then we have to subtract this number from the total number of animals. So, the number of animals not hiding is:  Total animals = 95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, there are 31 snakes and 61 crocodiles not hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 crocodiles in total. If 40 of them are hiding, then we can deduce that the number of non-hiding crocodiles is equal to the total number of crocodiles minus the number of hiding crocodiles. So, the number of non-hiding crocodiles is:  97 - 40 = 57 Non-hiding crocodiles. Therefore, there are 57 crocodiles that are not hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 crocodiles in total. If 82 snakes and 19 crocodiles hide together, then we can say that the number of snakes hiding is equal to the number of snakes not hiding plus the number of crocodiles hiding minus the number of crocodiles not hiding. So, we have: Number of snakes hiding = Number of snakes not hiding + Number of crocodiles hiding - Number of crocodiles not hiding Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of snakes hiding = 3 + (82 - 19) = 3 + 63 = 66 Number of snakes not hiding = 3 - 19 = -16 Therefore, there are 66 snakes hiding and -16 snakes not hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 79 creatures in the nest and we want to find out how many of them are hiding.  The snakes are 24 and the crocodiles are 51. So, if all of them are hiding, then the number of hidden creatures is equal to the total number of creatures minus the number of snakes and crocodiles that are hiding.  Therefore, the number of hidden creatures is:  79 - (24 + 51) = 79 - 75 = 4.  Hence, there are 4 creatures that are not hiding in the nest.
Response:  If he took 134 tomatoes yesterday and there are still 38 tomatoes left today, then we can calculate how many tomatoes he will have after today as follows: Total number of tomatoes = Number of tomatoes left today + Number of tomatoes taken yesterday = 38 + 134 = 172 So, after today, he will have 172 tomatoes left.
Response:  If he took 56 tomatoes yesterday and there are still 160 tomatoes left after that, then the number of tomatoes left now is:  160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes. So, after taking 41 tomatoes today, the number of tomatoes left is:  104 - 41 = 63 tomatoes.
Response:  If he took 154 tomatoes yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he has taken is:  154 + 50 = 204   So, he has taken 204 tomatoes in total.
Response:  If the farmer takes 172 kentangs, then he will have 3 (172 - 77) fewer kentangs left in his field. Since he has 175 tomatoes and 77 kentangs remaining after taking 172 kentangs, there are 38 tomatoes (175 - 3 = 38) left in his field.
Response:  If the farmer has 177 tomatoes and takes 53 of them, then he will have 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he has 12 potatoes and takes 6 of them, then he will have 12 - 6 = 6 potatoes left. So, the number of tomatoes and potatoes that the farmer has after taking some is 124 tomatoes and 6 potatoes.
Response:  If the farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in total, then he has 105 + 71 = 176 tomatoes altogether.  If he takes 137 tomatoes, then he leaves behind 176 - 137 = 49 tomatoes.
Response:  If John needs to cut 4 pieces of wood for his house wall and each piece requires 2 nails to be nailed down, then we can calculate the total number of nails needed as follows: Total number of nails = Number of pieces x Required nails per piece Total number of nails = 4 x 2 = 8 nails Therefore, John will need 8 nails to complete the task.
Response:  We know that for each large panel of wood, John needs 17 packets of glue to attach it to the wall. Since there are 13 large panels in total, he will need 13 x 17 = 201 packets of glue for these panels alone. However, as you mentioned, some smaller panels also require glue. Let's assume that these smaller panels require 8 packets of glue per panel, so they will use an additional 8 x number of small panels = 8xX packets of glue. Now we have two parts to our problem:  Part A: Large panels only (201 packets) + Part B: Small panels (8xX packets). To find out how many packets of glue John needs overall, we simply add up the quantities from both parts:  Total packets of glue needed = Part A + Part B = 201 + 8xX =?  So, based on the information provided, John needs a total of 209 packets of glue to stick all the wooden panels onto the wall.
Response:  We know that John will use 11 paku to cut the large wooden board. Each paper needs 3 paku for binding and an additional 8 paku have been used. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boards needed as follows: Number of boards = Total number of paku / Number of paku required per board  In this case, the total number of paku is 11 (for cutting one large wooden board), and the number of paku required per board is 3 + 8 = 11. So, John needs 11 boards.
Response:  For the big panels, John needs 12 x 15 = 180 packets of glue.  For the small panels, he needs 10 x 5 = 50 packets of glue.  Therefore, John needs a total of 180 + 50 = 230 packets of glue for the entire wall.
Response:  We know that each panel requires 2 packs of nails. Since John will use 16 panels, he will need 16 x 2 = 32 packs of nails in total. Therefore, John needs 32 packs of nails for his house wall.
Response:  If each large wooden panel requires 74 packets of glue to be attached, and there are 8 large wooden panels in total, then we need to calculate how many packets of glue are required for all 8 panels.  Therefore, the number of packets of glue needed is:  74 x 8 = 592 packets of glue.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large panels and 17 small panels in total.  Each large panel requires 14 staples to be attached, so we need 12 x 14 = 168 staples for all the large panels. Similarly, each small panel requires 25 staples, so we need 17 x 25 = 425 staples for all the small panels. Therefore, John needs a total of 168 + 425 = 593 staples for the entire wall.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in each package and Robin has several packages. So, we need to find out how many packages Robin has. Let's assume that the number of packages is x. Then, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is 42x. Now, we are asked to find out how many packages Robin has. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each package: 42x / 3 = x packages. Therefore, Robin has x packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of rubber bands and each package contains 23 rubber bands. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 1009 rubber bands. However, there are also 8 extra rubber bands that Robin got as an additional bonus. Therefore, the final number of rubber bands that Robin has is 1009 + 8 = 1017 rubber bands.
Response:  We know that there are 7 pieces of candy in each bag and Robin has 6 extra candies. So, the total number of candies Robin has is:  7 x 5 = 35 candies + 6 = 41 candies. Therefore, Robin has 5 bags of candy.
Response:  We know that there are 28 bags of rubber bands and 13 bags of sugar. Each bag contains 4 pieces of candy. So, in total, we have:  Number of bags = 28 + 13 = 41 bags.  Therefore, Robin has 41 x 4 = 164 pieces of candy (rubber bands).
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 bags of rubber bands and each bag contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that Robin has is:  21 x 9 = 189 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 bags of rubber bands and each bag contains 6 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of rubber bands = Total number of bags x Number of pieces in each bag  Number of rubber bands = 28 x 6  Number of rubber bands = 168  Therefore, Robin has 168 rubber bands.
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 shirts in one minute, then it will take 2 minutes to produce 6 shirts. So, the machine works at a rate of 1/2 minute per shirt. Therefore, the machine takes 1 minute to make 1 shirt.
"Response:  If the machine works for 5 minutes and can make 4 shirts in one minute, then it makes:
$ Number of minutes = 5 \text{ minutes} $
$ Number of shirts per minute = 4 \text{ shirts/minute} $
$ Total number of shirts = Number of minutes x Number of shirts per minute $
= $ 5 \times 4 $
= $20 \text{ shirts} $
Therefore, the machine produces $20$ shirts during the $5$-minute period."
"Response:  If Mesin industri can make 9 shirts per day and 44 shirts today, then we know that its production rate is 9/day = x/minute, where ""x"" represents the number of minutes per day. Since Mesin industri can produce 3 shirts in one minute, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 3(9) = 27 minutes/day. Therefore, Mesin industri works for 27 minutes per day."
Response:  If Mesin industri can make 13 shirts per day and 3 shirts today, that means it makes 10 shirts every hour (13/day x 24/hour). Now, if Mesin can produce 8 shirts in one minute, then it works for 10 minutes to produce 80 shirts (8/min x 10/minutes = 80 shirts). Therefore, Mesin industri works for 10 minutes to produce 80 shirts.
Response:  If Mesin industri can make 9 shirts per day and 8 shirts today, then it means that Mesin industri makes one shirt every x minutes. Since Mesin industri can make two shirts in one minute, we can write an equation as follows: 1/x = 2 (where x is the number of minutes) Now, we need to find out how many minutes Mesin industri works today. So, let's substitute the value given in the problem into our equation: 1/x = 2 9 = 45 minutes Therefore, Mesin industri works for 45 minutes today.
Response:  If the machine can make 3 shirts per minute today, then it made 4 x 3 = 12 shirts yesterday and 8 x 3 = 24 shirts today. So, the number of minutes the machine worked is:  Minutes = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per minute  Minutes = 12 + 24 = 36 minutes  Therefore, the machine worked for 36 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 6 shirts per minute. Therefore, if it works for 12 minutes, it will produce 6 x 12 = 72 shirts. Now, let's calculate how many shirts it will produce today. Since it has been working for 14 hours, it means it has produced 72 x 14 = 988 shirts today!
Response:  Firstly, we know that the machine can produce 6 shirts per minute. Therefore, if it works for 5 minutes, it will produce 30 shirts (6 x 5 = 30). Now, let's calculate how many shirts it will produce today. Since it works for 12 hours, it will produce 480 shirts (30 x 12 = 480) today. So, the answer is 480 shirts.
Response:  If they make the same amount of money every day ( $165 per day), then we can calculate their daily income as follows:  Daily Income = Total Amount / Number of Days = $165 / 5 days = $33 per day Now, to find out how much they made in total over the 5-day period, we simply multiply their daily income by the number of days: Total Amount = Daily Income x Number of Days = $33 x 5 days = $165 So, they made a total of $165 over the course of 5 days.
Response:  The game of ring toss makes $144 per day. Since they are at the carnival for 22 days, their total earnings can be calculated as follows: Total Earnings = Daily Earning x Number of Days = $144/day x 22 days = $3,068 So, the amount of money that the group made from playing the ring toss game is $3,068.
Response:  If they make $420 in total over 30 days playing the ring toss game, that means they made an average of $14 per day ($420 / 30 = $14).  Since they also made $22 from their own play, we can subtract that amount from the daily average to find out how much they made each day just from other players' bets: $14 - $22 = -$8. So, they lost $8 every day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 44 days, they made $382. Then, in the remaining 10 days, they made $374. So, if we add both amounts together, we get: $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the total amount of money they made is $756.
Response:  In the first 20 days of the carnival, they made $120 per day. To find out how many days they worked in this period, we can divide the total amount earned ($120) by the daily earnings ($120). This gives us: Number of days = Total amount / Daily earnings = $120 / $120 = 1 So, they worked for one day in the first 20 days of the carnival. Now let's move to the second part of the question. They made $66 per day in the remaining 16 days of the carnival. To find out how many days they worked in this period, we can divide the total amount earned ($66) by the daily earnings ($66). This gives us: Number of days = Total amount / Daily earnings = $66 / $66 = 1 So, they worked for one day in the remaining 16 days of the carnival as well. Therefore, the total number of days they worked during the entire duration of the carnival is: Total number of days = First 20 days + Remaining 16 days = 1 + 1 = 2 days
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, they made $325. This means they made an average of $2 per day during this period.  Then, for the remaining 57 days of the carnival, they made $114. This means they made an average of $2 per day during these 57 days as well. Therefore, the total amount they made each day was $2 x 154 = $308 and $2 x 57 = $104 respectively. So, they made $308 + $104 = $412 per day in total during the entire duration of the carnival.
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of biscuits and 4 packets of candy, then she must have spent money for both items. So, let's call the total amount of money she spent as x. Since she bought 10 packs of biscuits, each pack costs $x/10. Therefore, the cost of one packet of biscuit is $x/10. Similarly, since she bought 4 packets of candy, each packet costs $x/4. Therefore, the cost of one packet of candy is $x/4. Now we know that the cost of one packet of biscuit is $x/10 and the cost of one packet of candy is $x/4. To find out how many more packets of biscuits Lucy bought than packets of candy, we can divide the number of packets of biscuits (10) by the number of packets of candy (4): 10 / 4 = 2.5. So, Lucy bought 2.5 times more packets of biscuits than packets of candy.
Response:  If Lucy bought 4 packs of biscuits (22 pieces each), she bought a total of 88 biscuits.  If she also bought 16 packets of chocolate (each containing 10 pieces), she bought a total of 160 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Lucy bought a total of 88 + 160 = 248 items in all. So, there were 248 bags of rice that Lucy bought.
Response:  Lucy bought 23 packs of biscuits and some packets of chips. In total, she purchased 27 packages (23 + x) where x is the number of packets of chips she bought. So, the answer is 27.
Response:  Firstly, Lucy bought 2 packs of biscuits and 12 packets of candy. So far, she has spent $2 + $12 = $14. Then, she bought another 56 items that cost $56 - $14 = $42. Therefore, the total amount Lucy spent is $42. Hence, the number of boxes of runcit Lucy bought is  $42 / $3 = 14 boxes.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people boarded the bus later. According to the rule, each bus can have no more than 36 passengers. So, how many people are currently on the bus?  Solution:  Initially, there were 12 people on the bus = 12 x 1 = 12. Later, 4 more people boarded the bus = 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, there are currently 16 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 5 people in the bus (Ada lapan orang dalam bas). Then, 12 more people boarded the bus (naik), so the total number of people inside the bus now is: 5 + 12 = 17. Finally, 3 people got off the bus (turun), leaving 14 people still inside the bus (berada dalam bas). Therefore, the current number of people inside the bus is 14.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus (bas). Then, 9 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people now in the bus is:  4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people boarded the train. So, the total number of people now in the train is: 11 + 8 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 people currently in the train.
Response:  We know that there are 22 parents involved in the program and 676 people overall. To find out how many students are present, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of parents involved. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of students = Total number of people / Number of parents  Therefore, the answer is: Number of students = 676 / 22 = 30 Students
Response:  We know that there are 73 mothers and 724 students in the program. Therefore, we can say that the total number of people involved in the program is 73 + 724 = 797. So, the answer to your question is 797.
Response:  We know that there are 174 parents and 521 students in the program. To find out how many students are present for each parent, we need to divide the number of students by the number of parents. So, we can write: Number of students per parent = Number of students / Number of parents = 521 / 174 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 students present for every parent in the program.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61 parents involved in the program. Then, we have to add the number of students who are also attending the program, which is 177. Therefore, the total number of people present at the program is: 61 + 177 = 238 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the cave is 919 feet (280 meters). Then, we are asked how far they need to travel until the end of the cave. To find this out, we can use the formula Distance = Height x Speed / Time. In this case, the speed is 1307 feet/minute (400 meters/minute), and the time taken to reach the end of the cave is 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, the distance traveled until the end of the cave is: Distance = Height x Speed / Time = 919 x 400 / 60 = 5555 feet or 1695 meters. So, they need to travel 5555 feet or 1695 meters until the end of the cave.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1218 steps in total and they have already reached 849 steps. To find out how far they will be when they reach the end of the cave, we need to calculate the number of steps left until the end. We can do this by subtracting the number of steps they have already taken (849) from the total number of steps (1218). So, the number of steps left until the end is: 1218 - 849 = 369 steps. Therefore, if they continue moving at a rate of 17 steps per minute, they will take approximately 20 minutes and 5 seconds to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  If they are currently at an elevation of 659 feet and the cave is at an elevation of 762 feet, to reach the end of the cave, they need to climb another 103 feet (762 - 659 = 103).
"Response:  We know that:
Paige had 8 fish in her pond initially (i.e., before she left).
Kucing lied and took 6 goldfish from the pond while Paige was away.
So, after Kucing took the fish, there were only 2 fish remaining in the pond (i.e., 8 - 6 = 2).
Therefore, the number of goldfish that disappeared or ""hilang"" is 6."
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 goldfish and 12 betta fish in the tank. If the cat likes to eat them, then we can assume that some of the fish have been eaten. So, let's say x number of fish have been eaten (where x is a positive integer). Now, if there are still 15 fish left in the tank, then the total number of fish that were originally in the tank must be equal to the number of fish left minus the number of fish eaten. Therefore, we can write the equation: 7 + 12 = x - y, where y is the number of fish eaten. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, 9 fish were originally in the tank, and 6 have been eaten by the cat (since there are now only 15 fish left).
Response:  We know that initially there were 16 goldfish and 71 guppies in the tank. The cat likes to eat them, so we can assume that some of them have been eaten already. However, since there are only two more fish left now, it means that at least 14 goldfish (16 - 2) and 59 guppies (71 - 2) have been eaten by the cat. So, the number of goldfish that have been eaten is 14, and the number of guppies that have been eaten is 59.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 goldfish in the pond and 5 of them have been eaten by the cat. So, the number of goldfish left is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
"Response:  We know that selepas (plural of selepa) means ""chef"" in Malay. So, if selepas membuat (means ""make"" or ""create"") beberapa (meaning ""some"" or ""a few""), then we can infer that there are some chefs creating something. Now, the interesting part is that there are 2 epal kiri (meaning ""two left hands""). This implies that out of the total number of chefs creating something, only two have two left hands. Finally, we are told that pada mulanya (meaning ""initially"" or "" initially"") there were 43 epal (meaning ""hands"" or ""arms""). Therefore, the answer to the question is 43 - 2 = 41. So, there were 41 chefs who did not have two left hands initially."
Response:  We know that the total number of eggs is 58 and after cooking some of them were used up to 35. So, we need to find out how many eggs are left unused. To do this, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs used:  Number of eggs remaining = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs used  Number of eggs remaining = 58 - 35  Number of eggs remaining = 23 Therefore, there are 23 eggs left unused.
Response:  We know that the chef has 40 eggs and 54 peaches. After making some pastry dishes, he has 39 left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of eggs = 40 Number of peaches = 54 Total number of pastries made = 39 Now, let's solve for the number of eggs used in making the pastries: Number of eggs used = Total number of pastries - Number of peaches x Number of eggs per pastry To find out how many eggs were used to make each pastry, we need to divide the total number of pastries by the number of peaches: Number of eggs per pastry = Total number of pastries / Number of peaches x Number of eggs per pastry = 39 / 54 x 40 = 16 So, the chef used 16 eggs to make the pastries. Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  If Adam can fit 11 action figures in each shelf, and he has 4 shelves, then he can fit 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in total. However, since there are 40 cabinets, we need to divide the total number of action figures by 40 to find out how many action figures can be stored in each cabinet:  Number of action figures that can be stored in each cabinet = Total number of action figures / Number of cabinets = 44 / 40 = 1.1 action figures per cabinet. Therefore, Adam can store approximately 11 action figures in each of his 4 shelves, or 44 action figures in total.
Response:  If Adam can fit 10 action figures in each shelf and there are 8 shelves in his room, then we need to calculate how many shelves he has. We know that one shelf can hold 10 action figures, so if we divide the number of shelves (8) by the capacity of each shelf (10), we get: Number of shelves = 8 / 10 = 0.8 or 80% So, Adam has approximately 80% of his room filled with shelves, which means he has around 6.4 shelves (80% x 8 shelves = 6.4 shelves). Therefore, the answer is 6.4 shelves.
Response:  If Adam can fit 8 action figures and 10 cabinets in each shelf, then he has 8 x 4 = 32 action figures and 10 x 4 = 40 cabinets in total. So, the number of items that can be stored in Adam's room is 32 + 40 = 72.
Response:  We know that there are 544 pots in total and each pot has 32 flowers inside it. So, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Total Number of Flowers = Number of Pots x Number of Flowers per Pot Total Number of Flowers = 544 x 32 Total Number of Flowers = 17,696 Now, we have found out that there are 17,696 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 stems. So, in total, we have: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,078 flowers Number of stems = 466 x 181 = 86,966 stems Therefore, there are 24,078 flowers and 86,966 stems at the location.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pots and each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 stems. So, in total, we have:  Number of flowers = 71 x 141 = 9671 flowers Number of stems = 91 x 141 = 1251 stems Therefore, there are 9671 flowers and 1251 stems present here.
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers inside it. So, if we have x pots of flowers altogether, then the total number of flowers is 40x. Since there are 400 flowers in total, we can set up the equation: 40x = 400. Now, we solve for x: x = 10. Therefore, there are 10 pots of flowers in the area.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and he also has 4276 wipes. If we arrange them into groups of equal size, then... (1 answer)  So, if we divide both quantities by the number of groups we want to make, we get: Number of groups = Total quantity / Quantity per group = 4502 Skittles / 154 Skittles per group = 30 Groups Therefore, Steven's Skittles and wipes can be arranged into 30 groups of 154 Skittles each.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he also has 4950 wipes. If we divide the wipes among 495 groups of equal size, how many Skittles will each group have? To find out, let's use division. So, if we divide 4950 by 495, we get:  Number of wipes per group = 4950 / 495 = 10  Therefore, each group will have 10 wipes.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and we want to divide them into 8 groups of equal size. To do this, we can use division. So, we will divide 896 by 8 = 112. Therefore, each group contains 112 Skittles. Now let's count how many pencils Steven has:  Pencils = 517. Since each group contains 112 Skittles, we can calculate the number of groups as follows: Groups = Total number of Skittles / Number of Skittles per group = 896 / 112 = 8 groups. Finally, we can calculate the number of times Steven uses his eraser: Eraser usage = Total number of pencils x Number of times he uses his eraser per pencil = 517 x 90 = 46,300 times.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each grade has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of grades as follows: Number of grades = Total number of students / Number of students per grade = 270 / 5 = 54 grades So, there are 54 grades in total.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 Total Number of Students = 22,600. Therefore, there are approximately 22,600 students in this school.
