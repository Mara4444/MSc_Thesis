Response:  The number of children who played with Julia on Monday is greater than the number of children who played with her on Tuesday by 8 people (18 - 10 = 8).
Response:  The number of children who played with Julia on Tuesday is 12 - 11 = 1 more than the number of children who played with her on Monday.
Response:  On Tuesday, Julia played with 8 more children than she did on Monday, so she played with 8 + 5 = 13 children on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 8 children and ghosted with 14 children for a total of 22 children.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday (a day with 31 days), then she played with 12 more children than on Tuesday (a day with 30 days). Therefore, on Tuesday, Julia played with 12 + 16 = 28 children and ghosts.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 22 children and ghosts (8 more than the number of children she played with on Tuesday).
Response:  Julie played with a total of 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children.
Response:  On Monday (monthly day), Julie played with 5 children. On Wednesday (water day), she played with 15 children. Therefore, in total, Julie played with 5 + 15 = 20 children.
Response:  On Tuesday and Wednesday, Julia played with 14 + 16 = 30 children.
Response:  The number of children that Julie played with on Monday is 9 > 7 = 2 more than the number of children she played with on Tuesday.
Response:  The number of children Julia played with on Monday is 14 - 8 = 6 more than the number of children she played with on Wednesday.
Response:  The number of children that Julie played with on Tuesday is 11 - 9 = 2 more than the number of children she played with on Wednesday.
Response:  The number of children Julie played with on Monday and Tuesday combined is 15 + 18 = 33, which is more than the number of children she played with on Wednesday (7).
Response:  Julie played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 38 children in total.
Response:  To find out how many children Julie played with in total, we need to add up the number of children she played with on each day: Monday (7), Tuesday (13), and Wednesday (20). Therefore, the total number of children Julie played with is: 7 + 13 + 20 = 40.
"Response:  Julie played with 12 children and ghosts on Monday for x hours, and she played with 14 children and ghosts on Tuesday for y hours. In total, she spent 34 hours playing with children and ghosts. Let's denote the number of children she played with on Monday as 12x, and the number of children she played with on Tuesday as 14y. We can write an equation based on the information given:

12x + 14y = 34

Solve for x and y to find out how many children Julie played with on each day and how long she spent playing with them."
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 38 hours playing ghost hide-and-seek. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. Let's do that:

19 (Monday) - 18 (Tuesday) = 1

So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 6 children, which is 1 more than the number of children she played with on Tuesday (5).
Response:  The number of children that Julia played with on Tuesday is 10 (4 + 6).
Response:  The number of children who played with Julia on Monday is 6 - 4 = 2 more than the number of children who played with her on Wednesday.
Response:  If Bobby had eaten 25 more candies after eating some, and he had eaten a total of 43 candies in all, then he must have eaten at least 18 candies initially (25 + 18 = 43).
Response:  The total number of candies Bobbie ate is 28 + 42 = 70.
Response:  Bobby ate 33 candies and then added 4 more. He also ate 14 chocolates. Therefore, in total, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 candies and 14 chocolates.
"Response:  The difference between the number of candies Bobbie ate and the number of chocolates she ate is:  
38 (candies) - 16 (chocolates) = 22"
Response:  Bobby ate a total of 34 + 18 = 52 candies.
Response:  Bobby has 21 candies and he eats 5 of them. Then he eats 9 more. So, he has 21 - 5 - 9 = 7 candies left.
Response:  If Bobby had 22 candies and he ate some of them, then he must have eaten at least 5 candies (since he ate 5 more after that). So, if he has 8 candies left, he must have eaten 17 candies in total (22 - 8 = 17). Therefore, Bobby ate 17 candies initially.
Response:  Bobby has 19 candies and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 19 - 2 = 17 candies left.
"Response:  Bobbie ate 12 candies.

Response: 6 (Alan had 6 balloons and Jake had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons, so Alan had more balloons.)
Response: 7 (7 wind balloons)
Response: 8 (3 + 6)
"Response:  The total number of balloons held by Alan and Jake is:

(3 x 10) + (5 x 10) = 30 + 50 = 80

Therefore, they have a total of 80 balloons."
Response: 19 (7 + 6 = 13 + 4 = 19)
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balloons and they combined to bring 6 balloons to the park together, then Jack brought 1 balloon.
Response:  If Alan has 2 wind balloons and buys 3 more in the park, then he has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 wind balloons. If Jake brings 6 wind balloons to the park, then Jake has 6 wind balloons and is holding more wind balloons than Alan.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese, so he spends 4 more hours per day learning English than Chinese (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying Chinese every day, which is 1 hour more than the 6 hours he spends studying English.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and an additional 4 hours per day learning Chinese, for a total of 7 hours per day studying languages.
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours more on English than Chinese, so he spends 9 hours on Chinese (7 hours for English + 2 hours difference).
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours more studying English than Chinese. Therefore, he spends 5 + 3 = 8 hours studying English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day for 5 days, then he will have studied English for a total of 6 x 5 = 30 hours and Chinese for a total of 7 x 5 = 35 hours. Therefore, the combined total of his study time for both languages is 30 + 35 = 65 hours.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, then he studies for a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day.   Therefore, if he studies for 2 days, he will study for a total of 11 x 2 = 22 hours.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day studying English and 4 hours per day studying Chinese, and he studies for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:  

5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours studying English
4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours studying Chinese

Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 30 + 24 = 54 hours studying both languages over the course of 6 days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 + 6 = 10 hours per day studying languages.  
If he studies for 86 days, then he will spend a total of 10 x 86 = 860 hours studying languages."
"Response:  Ryan spends a total of 15 hours studying English, Chinese, and Spanish every day. To calculate this, you can add up the number of hours he spends on each language:

English (6 hours) + Chinese (7 hours) + Spanish (3 hours) = 15 hours"
Response:  Ryan spends 60 hours more on English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Spanish, so he spends 3 more hours per day learning English than Spanish (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Ryan spends twice as much time studying Chinese as he does studying Spanish. Therefore, he spends 5 hours x 2 = 10 hours more on Chinese than on Spanish.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English and x hours per day learning Chinese, where x is the difference between 3 hours and 2 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese (x = 1).
Response:  Ryan spends a total of 9 hours studying English and Chinese every day (4 hours for English + 5 hours for Chinese). Therefore, he spends a total of 63 hours studying both languages in 7 days (9 hours/day x 7 days).

Response:  There were more Action Figures (7) than books (2 + 4 = 6) in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  There are more books (9) than action figures (5) in Jerry's shelf.
"Response:  The total number of action figures on the shelf after Jerry added 4 new ones and removed 5 old ones is:

8 (initial) + 4 (new) - 5 (removed) = 17

Therefore, there were 17 action figures on the shelf in total."
Response:  Jerry removed 3 action figures from the shelf.
Response:  Jerry added 3 action figures to his shelf, bringing the total number of action figures to 8.
Response:  There were 7 action figures on Jerry's shelf initially.
Response:  There are more than 9 action figures in Jerry's shelf because he added 7 new ones later, so there are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total.
Response:  There are more Action Figures (4 + 2 = 6) than books (3) on the shelf.
Response:  There were more books (7) than action figures (3 + 2 = 5) on Jerry's shelf after he added two more action figures. So, there were 7 - 5 = 2 more books than action figures on his shelf.
Response:  The fence had 2 birds sitting on it initially. Additional birds joined, and now there are a total of 6 birds on the fence. Therefore, 4 more birds came to sit on the fence (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  There were initially 3 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 4 + 46 = 50 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 birds and 2 cranes sitting on the fence initially. If 5 more birds join, then there will be a total of 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. So, the final number of birds and cranes sitting on the fence is 3 + 2 + 8 = 13.
Response:  There are 5 birds sitting on the fence (3 sparrows and 4 crows). If two more birds join, there will be a total of 7 birds sitting on the fence (3 sparrows, 4 crows, and 2 additional birds).
Response:  There are more than twice as many crows (6) as there are birds of other species (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, there are at least 12 birds in total.
Response: 8 crows (2 + 6)
"Response:  There are 3 birds of one type (sparrows) and 4 birds of another type (cuckoos) sitting on the fence initially. Later, 6 more cuckoons join them, so the total number of birds and cuckoos sitting on the fence is:
3 + 4 = 7 (birds)
6 + 4 = 10 (cuckoos)
Therefore, there are a total of 17 birds and cuckoos sitting on the fence."
"Response:  There are more birds sitting on the fence than crows. Let's count the number of birds:

* Birds (other than crows): 6 x 4 = 24 birds
* Crows: 3 x 2 = 6 birds

Total number of birds: 24 + 6 = 30 birds.

Therefore, there are 30 birds sitting on the fence, and among them, there are more birds than crows."
Response:  There are 9 crows (3 + 6) sitting on the fence, and 4 birds (not crows). Therefore, there are a total of 13 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 + 4 = 10 birds sitting on the fence initially. If we add 8 crows, then there will be 10 + 8 = 18 birds sitting on the fence in total.
"Response:  There are more birds sitting on the fence than crows. Let's count the number of birds:

* Birds on the fence: 2 + 5 = 7
* Crows: 4

So, there are 7 - 4 = 3 more birds on the fence than crows."
Response:  There are more than 3 birds sitting on the fence because there were initially 3 birds and then 2 more birds joined them, making a total of 5 birds. Additionally, 6 crows joined them, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (5 + 6). Therefore, there are 8 more birds (11 - 3) sitting on the fence than when the story began.
Response:  The total number of birds is 5 + 3 = 8. Adding 4 more birds brings the total to 8 + 4 = 12. So, there are 12 birds in all.
Response:  There are 6 + 2 = 8 cranes sitting on the fence, and 3 additional birds have joined, so there are now 8 + 3 = 11 cranes sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are more than 3 birds sitting on the fence (3 + 6 = 9).

To find out how many more campers boarded the boat in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon from the number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning.

62 - 39 =?

Answer:  23. Therefore, there were 23 more campers who boarded the boat in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  The number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon (61) is greater than the number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning (52). Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 9 (61 - 52 = 9).
Response:  The number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon is 8 (32 - 15 + x = 0, where x is the number of campers who boarded in the afternoon).
Response:  In this case, we know that there were 7 people who boarded the boat in the afternoon and 30 people who boarded in the morning, for a total of 37 people. So, if 60 campers boarded the boat in total, then 60 - 37 = 23 people boarded the boat in the afternoon.
Response:  The total number of campers who boarded the boat is 36 + 13 + 49 = 98 people.
Response:  The number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning was more than the number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon by 5 people (44 - 39 = 5).
Response:  The number of campers who boarded the boat in the morning (53) is greater than the number of campers who boarded the boat at night (49), so there were 4 more campers who boarded the boat in the morning compared to at night.
Response:  The number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon (34) is 1 more than the number of campers who boarded the boat at night (10). So, the difference between the two numbers is 24 (34 - 10 = 24).
Response:  The total number of campers who went boating is 13 + 21 = 34 people.
Response:  In the morning, there were 29 people in the boat and 66 people went hiking, so there were 29 + 66 = 95 people in total. In the afternoon, there were 26 people in the boat, so there were 95 - 26 = 71 people who did not go boating in the afternoon. Therefore, more than 71 people (exactly 74) went boating in the morning compared to the afternoon.
Response:  There were 41 + 26 = 67 campers who went boating or hiking.
Response:  There were 46 campers in total. In the morning, 43 campers boarded the boat, and in the afternoon, some additional campers boarded the boat (the exact number is not given). Therefore, the total number of campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon is 46 - 43 = 3. So, there were 3 additional campers who boarded the boat in the afternoon.

Response:  Based on the information provided, Rachel has picked 7 x 4 = 28 apples in total.
Response:  Doug lost 19 beads.
Response:  Ed had 45 beads and lost 10, so he has 35 beads left (45 - 10 = 35).
Response:  If Ed has 22 beads and Doug loses 7 beads, then Doug has 7 - 7 = 0 beads left.
Response:  If Ed has 27 beads and Doug loses 3 beads in the playground, then Doug had 24 beads initially (27 - 3 = 24).
Response:  Ed had 24 more beads than Doug before they played the game. After the game, Doug lost 27 beads and found 9 beads, so he has 27 - 9 = 18 beads left. Therefore, Ed has 24 + 18 = 42 beads left.
Response:  Ed had 29 beads more than Doug before losing 17 beads in the playground. Therefore, after losing 17 beads, Ed has 29 - 17 = 12 beads left.
Response:  Ed lost 11 beads.
Response:  If Ed had 91 beads and lost 21 in the playground, then he has 70 beads left (91 - 21 = 70). Therefore, at that point, Ed had 70 beads more than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 17 beads and lost 20 beads in the playground, then Doug would have 20 - 17 = 3 more beads than Ed.
"Response:  There are 366 more students who proposed adding mashed potatoes than those who proposed adding bacon to the menu.  
Explanation:
To find out how many more students proposed adding mashed potatoes than bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed adding bacon from the total number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes.

Therefore, there are currently 1346 students enrolled in the school."
Response:  The total number of female students in the school is now 902 + 44 = 946.
Response:  The number of female students is greater than the number of male students by 632 - 410 = 222 people.
Response:  The total number of female students in the school is 732 + 682 = 1414.
Response:  The number of male students in the school is 910 + 214 = 1124.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 308 + 318 = 626 people.
Response:  The total number of people in the school is 315 + 309 + 772 = 1496 people.
"Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that there are 402 more female students than male students. So, if there are x male students, there would be x + 402 female students. We also know that the total number of students is 739. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 402) = 739

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 402 = 739

Subtracting 402 from both sides:

2x = 337

Dividing by 2:

x = 168

Therefore, there are 168 male students in the school."
Response:  If there are 458 more female students than male students and there are 692 female students in total, then the number of male students can be found by subtracting 458 from 692: Male students = 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  The number of female students is 403 + 257 = 660, which is more than the number of male students (362).
Response:  Edwad has $2 left ($16 - $14 = $2).
Response:  Edwad spent $10 (10 x 3 = 30).
Response:  Before Edward spent any money, he had $9 + $8 = $17 dollars.
Response:  Edwad had $16 before he spent any money.
Response:  The cost of one book is $6 / 2 = $3.
Response:  Edwad had $25 before he spent money on books and pens.
Response:  Edwad spent $4 for books and $3 for pens, so he spent a total of $7. He has $12 left, so he has $12 - $7 = $5 left.
Response:  Edwartd spent $16 for books and $8 for pens, so he spent a total of $16 + $8 = $24. Since he has $19 left, he spent less than $19, so he must have spent exactly $19 - $24 = $5 less than $19. Therefore, Edward spent $5 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Before Edward spent any money, he had $17 + $10 = $27.
Response:  The sum of Zachary's and David's arm raises is 44 + 58 = 102.
Response:  The difference between Zakary's and David's number of push-ups is 7 (51 - 44 = 7).
Response:  Zachary did 35 arm raises (44 - 9 = 35).
Response:  David and Zachary together did 51 + 49 = 100 arm raises.
Response:  David did 19 + 44 = 63 arm raises (arms up) and 27 - 44 = 23 crunches (abdominal curls).
Response:  Debbie did 13 x 2 = 26 crunches.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Zakari did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches, while David did 17 more push-ups than Zakari and 10 fewer crunches. Therefore, Zakari did 53 + 14 = 67 exercises in total, and David did 53 + 17 - 10 = 70 exercises in total.
"Response:  The difference between the number of push-ups done by David and the number of push-ups done by Zakari is:  

(58 - 35) + (87 - 3) = 23 + 84 = 107

Therefore, Zakari did 107 more push-ups than David."
"Response:  The difference between the number of crunches done by David and the number of push-ups done by Zachary is:  

(58 - 38) = 20

Therefore, Zachary did 20 more crunches than David."
Response:  David did 52 (39 + 13) arm raises.
Response:  John did 48 arm raises (51 - 22 + 4 = 48).
Response:  The difference between the number of push-ups done by Zakari and John is 24 (15 + 9 = 24).
"Response:  Based on the information provided, David did 37 reps of arm raises while Zakari did x reps.  We can set up an equation to represent this situation as follows:

Let D be the number of reps done by David (in this case, 37)
Let Z be the number of reps done by Zakari (to be determined)

We know that David did 30 more reps than Zakari, so we can write:
D = Z + 30

Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving for Z, we get:
Z = 30 - D
Substituting D = 37, we get:
Z = 30 - 37
Z = -7

So, Zakari did 7 fewer reps than David."
Response:  The sum of David's and Zakari's arm raises is 56 + 38 = 94.
Response:  If David did 40 more reps of arm circles than Zachary and 17 fewer reps of crunches, then David did 62 + 40 = 102 reps of crunches.
"Response:  The difference between the number of push-ups done by Zakari and David is:  

58 (Zakari's push-ups) - 33 (David's push-ups) = 25

Therefore, Zakari did 25 more push-ups than David."
Response:  If David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer crunches, then Zachary did 5 more push-ups and 17 more crunches than David. Therefore, Zachary did 5 + 17 = 22 more exercises than David.
Response:  The number of pages required for Rachel's mathematics homework was greater than the number of pages required for her reading comprehension homework by 3 pages (5 - 2 = 3).
Response:  The reading assignment was 4 pages long, which is 1 page more than the mathematics assignment (3 pages).
"Response: 3 pages.
Explanation: If Rachel has to complete 7 pages of homework in total and she has already completed 5 pages of math homework, then she needs to complete 2 more pages (7 - 5 = 2). Since she cannot complete the reading assignment without finishing the math homework, she must have completed at least 3 pages of the reading assignment (2 + 1 = 3) to reach the total of 7 pages."
"Response: 3 pages.
Explanation: If Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework and she did not have enough time to finish it all, then she must have spent at least 4 more pages on math than she would have spent on reading. Since she spent 7 - 4 = 3 pages on math, she spent 3 pages on reading."
Response:  Rachel completed 3 pages of math homework and 5 pages of reading homework, for a total of 8 pages.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and she completed 6 pages of reading homework instead, then she would have had to complete an additional 2 pages of reading homework (8 - 6 = 2).
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 3 pages of reading homework instead of 10 pages of math homework, she would have completed a total of 3 + 7 = 10 pages.
Response:  Rachel would have had to do 15 pages of homework (2 + 3 + 10).
Response:  The number of pages for mathematics homework is 9 pages, which is more than the number of pages for reading homework (2 pages) by 7 pages.
Response:  The number of pages for mathematics homework was more than the number of pages for biology homework by (11 - 2 =) 9 pages.
"Response:  The reading assignment was 11 pages long, and the biology assignment was 8 pages long, so the difference in page count between the two assignments is:

11 - 8 = 3 pages

Therefore, the reading assignment had 3 more pages than the biology assignment."
Response:  The student completed 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in total.
Response:  The total number of pages for math and biology homework combined would be 10 pages (8 + 3).
Response:  The total number of pages for Rachel's homework in mathematics, reading, and biology is:  5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages.
Response:  The math homework was 2 pages longer than the reading homework.

"Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning, which is more than the number of emails he received at night (7). Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number of emails he received at night is:

9 - 7 = 2"
Response:  The number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is greater than the number of emails he received in the evening by 4 (5 - 4 = 4).
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails in total that day and he received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon, then he must have received 1 email in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 8 mail (3 in the morning + 5 in the afternoon) and 120 letters (64 in the morning + 54 in the afternoon).
Response: 13 (5 + 6 + 9 + 7)
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters, for a total of 22 communications. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails and 44 letters, for a total of 47 communications. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon by a difference of 22 - 3 = 19.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters, for a total of 14 communications. In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters, for a total of 9 communications. Therefore, Jack received more handwritten letters in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 8 (2 + 6) emails that day.
Response:  Jack sent 8 emails in the afternoon (6 + 2 = 8).
Response:  Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning. Therefore, Jack received 7 + 2 = 9 emails in the afternoon.
"Response:  In the morning (午前), Jack received 5 emails, and in the afternoon (午後), he received 3 emails, so the difference is:

5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  If Jack received 10 emails in total that day and received 3 emails in the afternoon, then he received 7 emails in the morning (10 - 3 = 7).
Response:  The frog jumped 3 inches (12 - 9 = 3) farther than the bat.
Response:  The total jump distance is 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
"Response:  The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the cricket.  
Explanation:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Cricket jumped 36 inches.
* Frog jumped 17 inches more than the cricket.

So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Frog's jump = Cricket's jump + 17 inches

Substituting the value of the cricket's jump:

Frog's jump = 36 + 17

Solving for the frog's jump:

Frog's jump = 53 inches

Therefore, the frog jumped 53 inches."
"Response:  The mouse jumped 2 inches more than the frog. 
Explanation:  We know that the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the bat, and the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these distances:

Frog (jump distance) = Bat + 18
Mouse (jump distance) = Frog + 2
We can substitute the values given in the problem into these equations to find the distance each animal jumped:

Frog (jump distance) = 25 + 18 = 43 inches
Mouse (jump distance) = 43 + 2 = 45 inches
Therefore, the mouse jumped 45 inches."
Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped is 20 + 10 = 30 inches (more than twice the distance of the bat).
"Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches.  
Explanation:  We know that the kangaroo jumped 19 inches and the mouse jumped 94 inches less than the frog. So, we can set up an equation based on these values:

Frog (F) = Kangaroo (K) + Mouse (M)

Substituting the given values:

F = K + M

19 + (-94) = F

F = -75

Therefore, the frog jumped 39 inches (19 + (-75))."
Response:  The mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog's jump of 32 inches, so the mouse jumped 32 - 26 = 6 inches.
Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped is 29 inches (5 inches less than the frog's jump of 33 inches).
Response:  The frog jumped 10 inches (2 inches less than the distance butterfly jumped).
Response:  The total distance jumped by both the bat and the frog is 39 inches (35 + 4).
Response:  The frog jumped 44 inches (4 x 11 = 44).
Response:  The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog. So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the mouse jumped x - 12 inches.
Response:  The distance that the kangaroo jumped beyond the mouse is = (21 - 16) inches = 5 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches, so the frog jumped 22 inches (39 - 17) farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  The mouse jumped 3 inches less than the bat, so the mouse jumped 6 inches (9 - 3).
Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped can be calculated as follows: Let X = the distance that the mouse jumped. We know that the frog jumped 14 inches (X + 14), and the rat jumped 37 inches less than the frog (X - 37). Therefore, we can set up the equation: X + 14 = 37 - X To solve for X, we can add X to both sides of the equation: 2X + 14 = 37 + 14 2X = 51 X = 25 So, the mouse jumped 25 inches.

Response:  There will be 45 families of birds remaining near the mountain if 23 families fly to Africa and 37 families fly to Asia.
"Response:  The number of bird families that flew to Africa is 42, and the number of bird families that flew to Asia is 31. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:

42 - 31 = 11

So, there are 11 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  The number of bird families that flew to Asia is 94, which is more than the number of bird families that flew to Africa (47). Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:

94 - 47 = 47

So, there are 47 more bird families in Asia than in Africa."
Response:  The number of bird families that flew to Africa is 38, and the number of bird families that flew to Asia is 80. Therefore, the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter is 38 + 80 = 118.
Response:  There will be 87 + 18 = 105 bird families living near the mountain if 18 new bird families join the existing 87 families.
Response:  There are 49 + 59 = 108 families of birds that have not migrated from the mountainous area for winter.
Response:  The number of bird families that remained in the mountainous area is 41 - 27 = 14 families.
Response:  The number of bird families that flew south for winter is 86.
Response:  The number of bird families that fly to Africa is greater than the number of bird families that fly to Asia by 62 - 35 = 27 families.
Response:  There are 3 bird families remaining near the mountain, as 2 families flew south for winter and 26 new families arrived from the North Pole but did not fly south.
"Response:  The number of crayons Poll had at the end of the school year can be calculated as follows:

Number of crayons given to Poll = 253
Number of crayons lost or given away by Poll = 70

Therefore, the number of crayons left with Poll = 253 - 70 = 183

So, Poll had 183 crayons left with him at the end of the school year."
Response:  Poll received 551 - 177 = 374 boxes of crayons as birthday gifts.
"Response:  The number of crayons Poll has left is calculated as follows:

Total number of crayons given to Poll = 440
Number of crayons given to friends = 111
Number of crayons lost = 106

Subtracting the number of crayons given to friends and lost from the total number of crayons, we get:

Remaining crayons = Total number of crayons - (Number of crayons given to friends + Number of crayons lost)
= 440 - (111 + 106)
= 440 - 217
= 223

Therefore, Poll has 223 crayons left."
Response:  The number of lost or given away crayons is 16.
"Response:  The number of crayons Poll received minus the number of crayons he lost is equal to the number of crayons he gave away plus the number of crayons he kept. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

589 - 161 = 571 + x

where x represents the number of crayons Poll kept. Solving for x, we get:

x = 428

Therefore, Poll had 428 crayons left after giving some away and losing some."
"Response:  The difference between the number of crayons Poll lost and the number of crayons he gave to his friends is:

412 - 90 = 322

Therefore, Poll lost 322 crayons more than he gave to his friends."
Response:  The number of crayons Poll received as a birthday gift is 332.
Response:  If Poll has only 492 remaining crayons and he gave 52 to his friends and lost 535, then the number of crayons that were either given away or lost is:  52 + 535 = 617.
Response:  The number of lost or donated crayons is 307 (521 - 154).
Response:  The number of pens Poll has left is 391 - 38 = 353.
Response:  The number of erasers Poll left is 336.
Response:  Poll received 315 - 291 = 24 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift.
"Response:  The number of crayons given to Poll is 267. He lost 231 crayons and gave 308 crayons to his friends. Therefore, the difference between the number of crayons he lost and the number of crayons he gave to his friends is:

267 - (231 + 308) = 267 - 549 = -282

So, Poll has 282 fewer crayons than he started with."
Response:  Poll received 320 pens and did not lose any erasers during the school year, so he had 320 - 457 = 263 pens left at the end of the year.
Response:  The number of customers who left before the remaining three is 8 (11 - 3 = 8).
"Response:  The waiter had 3 customers initially. If some of them left, he would have had fewer than 3 customers remaining. Therefore, the number of customers who remained after some left can be calculated as follows:

3 - x = 4 (where x is the number of customers who left)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

Therefore, one customer left, and the waiter was left with 2 customers."
Response:  There were 9 people who left after the waiter served them. So, initially there were 9 + 12 = 21 customers in total.
Response: 9 people (14 - 5 = 9).
Response:  If there were originally 13 customers and 4 new customers arrived later, leaving 9 customers in total, then 4 customers must have left.
Response:  The waiter has 14 new customers after 15 old customers left, so he currently has 14 + 12 = 26 customers in total.
Response:  The number of new customers who arrived after the initial 3 customers and before the total of 8 customers is 5 (8 - 3 = 5).
Response:  The number of customers who left after some had arrived can be calculated as follows: Let X be the number of customers who left after some had arrived. We know that 8 customers were present initially, and X customers left, so the total number of customers present at any given time is: 8 + X. We also know that 5 customers remained after some had left, so we can set up the equation: 8 + X = 5. Solving for X, we get: X = 3. Therefore, 3 customers left after some had arrived.
Response:  The waiter currently has 14 + 10 = 24 customers.
Response:  $5.
Response:  The candy bar cost $4 - $3 = $1.
Response:  $4 - (99 x 3) = $4 - 297 = $393.
Response:  $3 / 2 = $1.50 per candy bar.
Response:  Dan bought 6 candies at $3 each, so he spent $3 x 6 = $18 on candies.
Response:  The remaining amount of money is $7 - 2 = 5 dollars + 3 = 8 dollars.
Response:  $13 (7 + 6)
Response:  Dan used $3 to buy chocolate and spent $6 on candy bars, so he spent a total of $3 + $6 = $9.
Response:  The amount of money that Dan spent on chocolate is $3. He used $2 to buy candy bars, so he spent an additional $1 on chocolate. Therefore, the answer is $1.
Response:  $4 + $5 = $9.
Response:  If Dan had $4 before buying the candy bar and he spent $3, then the price of the candy bar was $1.
Response:  $4 - (10 x $3) = $4 - $30 = $4 - 36 = -$32.
Response:  The cost of one candy bar is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
Response:  $2 (the amount of money Dan spent on candy bars) - $3 (the amount of money Dan spent on chocolate) = $2.
Response:  Dan spent $4 + $2 = $6 on chocolate and candy.
Response: 37 books (115 - 78 = 37).
Response:  Poll had 137 books at first and sold 137 - 105 = 32 books at the garage sale, so he has 32 books left.
Response:  The number of books sold at the garage sale is 62 (62 - 35 = 27).
Response:  Poll bought 151 - 50 = 101 books.
Response:  The number of books Poll sold is 58 - 150 = 92 books.
Response:  Poll sold 21 - 42 = 21 books.
Response:  Poll has 116 books, and he sold some books at the garage sale, so he has more books than he had before. Let's say he had x books before the garage sale. After selling some books, he has (x - y) books left, where y is the number of books he sold. Since he bought 38 new books, he now has (x - y) + 38 = 116 books. Solving for x, we get x = 92, so Poll had 92 books before the garage sale. He sold y = 40 books (since he has 40 fewer books after the sale), and he bought 38 new books, so he has 92 + 38 = 130 books in total. Therefore, Poll has 130 - 92 = 38 more books than he had before the garage sale.
Response:  Poll sold 32 books at the garage sale (108 - 66 = 32).
Response:  The number of pens sold at the garage sale is 14.
Response:  Poll sold 136 - 27 = 109 books.
Response:  The number of books sold at the garage sale is 68.

Response:  Jessica cut 14 - 13 = 1 more rose than she had before.
Response:  Jessica cut 3 flowers (3 x 1 = 3).
Response:  There are 22 roses in the vase, and 21 lilies. The difference between the number of roses and lilies is 22 - 21 = 1. So there are one more rose than lily in the vase.
Response:  There are 13 lilies (L) and 3 roses (R) in the vase now. To find out how many more lilies there are than roses, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of lilies: L - R = 13 - 3 = 10. So, there are 10 more lilies than roses in the vase.
Response:  Robin cut 4 inches from her hair. 
Response:  If Robin cut her hair by 20 inches and it is currently 10 inches long, then she had 30 inches of hair before cutting it (20 + 10 = 30).
"Response:  The length of Robin's hair after she cut 11 inches and then grew 12 inches is calculated as follows:

Initial length = 16 inches (given)
Cut length = 11 inches (given)
Growth length = 12 inches (given)

New length = Initial length - Cut length + Growth length
= 16 inches - 11 inches + 12 inches
= 13 inches

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 13 inches long."
"Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and she wants to add another 18 inches, then her new hair length would be:  
19 + 18 = 37 inches."
Response:  Robyn's hair is now 13 - 14 = 1 inch long.
Response:  The length of Robin's hair after cutting it by 20 inches is (14 + 8) - 20 = 12 inches.

Response:  Danie found 9 pieces of wrapping paper in the park, which is 65 - 5 = 60 more than the number of bottle caps he found.
Response:  Dan has 12 bottle caps and 11 wrappers in his collection now. Therefore, he has 12 - 11 = 1 more bottle cap than wrapper.
"Response:  Danie has 18 more wrappers than bottle caps. 
Explanation:  To find out how many wrappers Danie has more than bottle caps, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers. We can do this by subtracting 35 (the number of bottle caps) from 18 (the number of wrappers):

18 - 35 =?

The result is:

18 - 35 = -17

So, Danie has 17 more wrappers than bottle caps."

Response:  Jake has 12 - 19 = 7 fewer apples than Steve.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steve and 3 more apples. Let's use ""P"" to represent peaches and ""A"" to represent apples. We know that Steve has 9P + 8A. Jake has 13 fewer peaches, so he has 9P - 13. Since Jake has 3 more apples, we can write his total as 9P - 13 + 3A. Now we need to find out how many apples Jake has. Substituting P = 9 (since Steve has 9 peaches), we get: 9P - 13 + 3A = 9(9) - 13 + 3(8) A = 81 - 13 + 24 A = 68 apples. Therefore, Jake has 68 apples."
Response:  Stevie has more apples than Jack by 17 - 6 = 11 apples.
Response:  Stephen has more apples than Jack by 15 - 12 = 3 apples.

Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries was 19 pounds, and his father's strawberries weighed 4 pounds in total. Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 15 pounds (19 - 4) heavier than his father's strawberries.
Response:  The father's strawberries were heavier than Marco's by (35 - 13) = 22 pounds.
Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries is 3 pounds (17 - 14 = 3).
Response:  The total weight of Marco's and his father's strawberries is 8 + 32 = 40 pounds.
Response:  The father's strawberries weighed 15 pounds (24 - 9 = 15).
Response:  The weight of Marco's father's strawberries is 8 pounds (8 x 1 lb = 8 lbs).
Response:  The weight of Marco's father's strawberries is 30 pounds + 36 pounds = 66 pounds.
"Response:  The total weight of Marco's strawberries is 15 pounds, and the total weight of all the strawberries is 37 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's strawberries can be calculated as follows:

Total weight of all strawberries - Total weight of Marco's strawberries = Weight of Marco's father's strawberries

37 pounds - 15 pounds = 22 pounds

So, Marco's father's strawberries weigh 22 pounds."
Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries was 30 pounds, and the total weight of their strawberries was 17 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 13 pounds (30 - 17) heavier than his father's strawberries.
Response:  The father's strawberries were heavier than Marco's by 16 pounds (26 - 10 = 16).
Response:  Based on the information provided, Marco's strawberries weighed 11 pounds each, and his father's strawberries weighed 11 pounds as well. Therefore, together they had 22 pounds (11 + 11) of strawberries. To find out how much Marco's strawberries weighed individually, we can divide the total weight by two: 22 / 2 = 11 pounds per basket. So Marco's strawberries weighed 11 pounds each.
Response:  The bus currently has 8 more children than it had at the bus stop.
Response:  The total number of children who are currently on the bus is 26 + 38 = 64 people.
Response:  There were 43 children in total who rode the bus, including the two children who got on at the previous stop.
Response:  The number of children who got off the bus at the stop is 22 (43 - 21 = 22).
Response:  The number of children who were on the bus before any got off is equal to the number of children who are left on the bus after some have gotten off, which is 18. Therefore, there were 18 more children on the bus before any got off than there are now.
"Response:  The number of children who boarded the bus at the bus stop is equal to the difference between the total number of children on the bus (16) and the number of children who got off the bus (10). Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus at the bus stop is:  
16 - 10 = 6"
Response:  The number of children who got off the bus is 63. If 5 children were already on the bus before it stopped, then the total number of children on the bus at that point was 63 + 5 = 68. Since there were 14 children on the bus after everyone had disembarked, we can deduce that 68 - 14 = 54 more children got on the bus while it was stopped.
"Response:  The number of children who got off the bus is 68. If 36 children were already on the bus, then the total number of children on the bus was 36 + 68 = 104. Since only 12 children remained on the bus, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who remained on the bus is:  

104 - 12 = 92. Therefore, there were 92 more children who got off the bus than remained on it."
"Response:  The number of children who got off the bus at the stop is equal to the difference between the total number of children on the bus and the number of children remaining on the bus after they reached their destination. Therefore, if there were initially 22 children on the bus and 40 children boarded the bus at the stop, then the number of children who got off the bus would be:

40 - 2 = 38

So, 38 children got off the bus at the stop."
"Response:  The number of children who boarded the bus is equal to the number of children who got off the bus plus the number of children who remained on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Children who boarded = Children who got off + Children who remained

We know that 82 children got off the bus and 30 children remained on the bus, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

82 = 30 + x

Where x is the number of children who boarded.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 52

Therefore, there were 52 children who boarded the bus."
Response:  The difference between the number of children who boarded and the number of children who got off is 8 (24 - 16 = 8).
"Response:  The baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them. To find out how many more cakes he made than he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made:

Question:  3人の子供が24本の杖を分け合っているとする。最初に2本の杖を選んでみました。次に、残りの杖を3人それぞれ1本ずつ選びました。最後に、どの子供がどの杖を持っていますか？ 
Based on the information given, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's assign a number to each child and a letter to each stick. Child 1 has C1, Child 2 has C2, and Child 3 has C3. We know that Child 1 chose two sticks first, so we can represent this as follows:

C1: S1 + S2 (where S1 and S2 are the two sticks chosen by Child 1)

Next, Child 2 chooses one stick, so we have:

C2: S3 (where S3 is the one stick chosen by Child 2)

Finally, Child 3 chooses one stick, so we have:

C3: S4 (where S4 is the one stick chosen by Child 3)

Now, let's add up all the sticks held by each child:

C1: S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 = 4 (since each child holds one stick)

So, Child 1 holds stick S1, Child 2 holds stick S2, and Child 3 holds stick S3."

Response:  If Randi has 59 blocks and builds a tower with 36 blocks, then she has 23 blocks left (59 - 36 = 23).
"Response:  Randi used 50 blocks to build the tower, which is more than the 20 blocks she used to build her house. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house is:

50 - 20 = 30

So Randi used 30 additional blocks to build the tower compared to the number of blocks she used to build her house."
Response:  The difference between the number of blocks used to build the house and the number of blocks used to build the tower is 27 (89 - 63).
"Response:  The person has read 5 out of 20 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series."
"Response:  There are 13 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series, and I have read 5 books (13 - 5 = 8)."
Response:  To watch all 56 movies and read all 12 books, you would need to read an additional 10 books (22 - 12 = 10).
"Response:  To see all the movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series, you would need to read 19 books and watch 7 movies."
Response:  There are 16 novels (19 - 13 = 6).
Response:  The number of movies is greater than the number of books by 61 - 19 = 42 more movies.
Response:  The number of books read (13) is greater than the number of movies watched (12), so the correct answer is 1 book more than the number of movies.
Response:  The number of movies watched is greater than the number of books read by 4 more than the number of books read. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response: 6 more books need to be read to complete the series if there are 14 different books in total.
Response:  To watch all 34 movies and read all 4 books, you need to read 58 more books (34 x 2 = 68 - 4).
Response:  The number of movies that need to be watched is calculated as follows: Total number of books - Number of books read = Number of movies left to watch. In this case, Total number of books = 21 (since there are 21 different novels in the series). Number of books read = 7 (since the person has read 7 of the novels). Therefore, Number of movies left to watch = Total number of books - Number of books read = 21 - 7 = 14. So, the person needs to watch 14 more movies to complete the series.
"Response:  There are 15 types of books in the ""Crazy Serial School"" series, and the person has read 11 of them. Therefore, there are 4 more books than movies (15 - 4 = 11)."
Response:  The number of movies is more than the number of books by 63 - 13 = 50.
Response:  The number of books read (19) is greater than the number of movies watched (14), so the correct answer is 5 (19 - 14).
Response:  The number of movies read is 19 (19 > 16), so the person has read more movies than books.
Response:  Dave has 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys. If he still has 2 tickets left, then he must have used 5 tickets (7 - 2 = 5) to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave has 14 tickets left and he used 12 tickets to buy a toy, then he has 14 - 12 = 2 tickets left.
Response:  Dave has 18 tickets and he used 5 for toys and 11 for clothes, so he has 18 - 5 - 11 = 2 left.
Response:  Dave used 12 tickets for toy purchases and 7 tickets for clothing purchases, for a total of 19 tickets used.
Response:  The number of tickets used for buying clothes is 18 - 8 = 10 more than the number of tickets used for buying toys.
Response:  If Dave has 14 tickets and loses 2, he will have 12 tickets left if he uses 10 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  The number of trees that died in the typhoon is 9 (9 - 5 = 4).

"Response:  To find out how many oranges the person will harvest in one day, we need to multiply the number of bags they can collect per day (66) by the number of oranges in each bag (28). Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is:

66 x 28 = 1848 oranges"
Response:  To collect 24 bags of oranges, it will take him 3 days to do so, assuming he can collect 8 bags per day.
"Response:  If he harvested 56 bags of oranges in total and the harvest lasted for 4 days, then he would have harvested:

56 bags / 4 days = 14 bags per day

Therefore, he would have harvested 14 bags of oranges per day."
"Response:  To find out how many bags of oranges the farmer will have after 49 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges collected in 49 days and then divide it by the number of oranges per bag. Let's start by calculating the daily yield of oranges:  
Daily Yield = Total Number of Oranges / Number of Days 
We know that the farmer collects 38 bags of oranges per day, so we can set up an equation:  
Total Number of Oranges = Daily Yield x Number of Days 
Substituting values, we get:  
Total Number of Oranges = (38/day) x 49 days 
Simplifying and solving for the total number of oranges, we get:  
Total Number of Oranges = 38 x 49 = 1,762 oranges 
Now, we know that each bag contains 42 oranges, so we can calculate the total number of bags:  
Total Number of Bags = Total Number of Oranges / Number of Oranges per Bag 
Substituting values, we get:  
Total Number of Bags = 1,762 / 42 = 41 bags 
Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, the farmer will have 41 bags of oranges."
"Response:  To find out how many oranges the farmer has after 87 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges he would have collected based on the information given. Let's break down the problem step by step:  
1. Daily orange collection: The farmer collects 66 bags (or 66 x 25 = 1650 oranges) per day.  
2. Total orange collection over 87 days: Since the harvest lasted for 87 days, the farmer would have collected:  
66 bags/day x 87 days = 5,832 bags (or 5,832 x 25 = 145,800 oranges) in total.  Therefore, the farmer would have approximately 145,800 oranges after 87 days of harvesting."
Response:  The person can collect 8 bags of oranges per day, and each bag contains 35 oranges, so they can collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  To calculate how many days it would take to harvest 80 bags of oranges, we need to know how many oranges are in each bag and how many bags can be harvested per day. Let's use the information given in the problem: There are 57 oranges in each bag, and 16 bags can be harvested per day. Therefore, to harvest 80 bags of oranges, we need: 80 bags x 57 oranges/bag = 4560 oranges Total number of oranges needed = 4560 oranges / 16 bags/day = 284 days So, it would take approximately 284 days (or about 9 months) to harvest 80 bags of oranges.
Response:  To find out how many oranges will be collected in total if 35 bags are harvested, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of oranges per bag. So, the total number of oranges collected = 35 x 12 = 420 oranges.
Response:  The person would have 3 orange bags (71 - 2 = 3) after 51 days of harvesting, assuming they discarded 2 bags each day.
"Response:  If one bag contains 50 oranges and the farmer harvested 76 bags in one day, then the total number of oranges harvested is:

76 bags x 50 oranges/bag = 3800 oranges"
"Response:  The number of oranges the man will have after 26 days of harvesting is calculated as follows:

Day 1: 28 bags x 1 day = 28 bags
Day 2: 28 bags x 2 days = 56 bags
Day 3: 56 bags x 3 days = 84 bags
...
Day 26: 84 bags x 26 days = 2104 bags

Therefore, the man will have 2104 bags of oranges after 26 days of harvesting."
"Response:  To find out how many bags of mature oranges the farmer will have after 25 days, we need to calculate the total number of bags of oranges he harvested and then subtract the number of bags that are not yet ripe. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The farmer harvested 82 bags of mature oranges per day.
* He also harvested 61 bags of unripe oranges per day.
* There are 30 days in a month (assuming a 30-day month).

Now, let's do some calculations:

1. Total number of bags of oranges harvested in one month = 82 x 30 + 61 x 30 = 2460 + 1830 = 4290 bags
2. Number of bags of mature oranges harvested in one month = 82 x 30 = 2460 bags
3. Number of bags of unripe oranges harvested in one month = 61 x 30 = 1830 bags
4. Total number of days the farmer will wait before selling his oranges = 25 days

Now, let's calculate how many bags of mature oranges the farmer will have after 25 days:

Total number of bags of mature oranges after 25 days = Total number of bags of mature oranges harvested in one month - Number of bags of mature oranges sold per day x Number of days waited
= 2460 - (82 x 25)
= 2460 - 2050
= 405 bags

Therefore, the farmer will have 405 bags of mature oranges after 25 days."
Response:  The number of unripe oranges that will be after 45 days of harvesting is 24 x 45 = 1080 oranges.
"Response:  The number of mature oranges harvested per day is 44 bags, and the number of immature oranges harvested per day is 25 bags. To find out how many more mature oranges are harvested than immature ones, we can subtract the number of immature oranges from the number of mature oranges:

44 - 25 = 19

So, 19 more mature oranges are harvested per day than immature ones."
Response:  The number of bags of unripe oranges collected per day is 74 - 5 = 69 bags more than the number of bags of ripe oranges collected per day.
Response:  To find out how many days it took to harvest 54 bags of oranges if they harvested 18 bags per day, we can divide 54 by 18: 54 / 18 = 3 So, it took 3 days to harvest 54 bags of oranges.
Response:  If he harvested for 14 days and collected a total of 56 bags of oranges, then he would have harvested an average of 56/14 = 4 bags per day.
"Response:  To find out how many bags of mature oranges the farmer will have after 73 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of bags of oranges he can harvest in one day and then multiply it by the number of days he has been harvesting. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The farmer can harvest 25 immature oranges per day.
* He can harvest 5 mature oranges per day.
* He has been harvesting for 73 days.

So, let's start by calculating the total number of immature oranges the farmer can harvest in 73 days:

25 x 73 = 1825

Now, let's calculate the total number of mature oranges the farmer can harvest in 73 days:

5 x 73 = 365

Now, let's add up the total number of immature and mature oranges the farmer can harvest in 73 days:

1825 + 365 = 2190

Therefore, after 73 days of harvesting, the farmer will have 2190 bags of oranges, including both immature and mature ones."
"Response:  The number of unripe oranges that will be after 6 days can be calculated as follows:

Day 1: 65 unripe oranges x (1 - 0.6) = 23.8 unripe oranges per day are not yet ripe.

Therefore, after 6 days:

23.8 x 6 = 142.8 unripe oranges."
Response:  The number of bags of mature oranges collected per day is 86 - 41 = 45 bags more than the number of bags of immature oranges collected per day.
"Response:  The number of bags of unripe oranges collected per day is 71, and the number of bags of ripe oranges collected per day is 60. To find out how many more bags of unripe oranges are collected per day than bags of ripe oranges, we can subtract the number of bags of ripe oranges from the number of bags of unripe oranges:

71 - 60 = 11

So, 11 bags more of unripe oranges are collected per day than bags of ripe oranges."
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 12 feet - 11 feet = 1 foot longer than the width.
Response:  The width of Jessie's room is 7 feet - 2 feet (for the length) = 5 feet.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 20 feet (7 x 3 = 21 feet).
Response:  To cover the entire floor of Jesse's room with carpet, we need to calculate the area of the room first. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length and width of the room are given as 11 feet and 15 feet, respectively. So, the area of the room is: Area = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since Jessie already has 16 square feet of carpet, we only need an additional 149 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  To cover the entire floor of Jesse's room with tiles that are 4 square feet each and have a length of 2 feet and a width of 12 feet, we need to calculate the total area of the floor. The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length is 2 feet and the width is 12 feet, so the area of the floor is: Area = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Since each tile covers 4 square feet, we need: Number of tiles = Total area / Size of each tile Number of tiles = 24 / 4 Number of tiles = 6 Therefore, we need 6 tiles to cover the entire floor of Jesse's room.
Response:  To cover all 20 rooms with carpet, we need to calculate the total area of each room and then determine how much carpet is needed based on the length and width of each room. Let's start by calculating the area of one room: Area = Length x Width Area = 19 feet x 18 feet Area = 324 square feet Now, let's multiply the area of one room by 20 to get the total area required for all 20 rooms: Total Area = 20 x 324 square feet Total Area = 6,480 square feet Since the carpet comes in rolls of 12 feet wide, we can divide the total area by the width of the carpet to determine how many rolls are needed: Number of Rolls = Total Area / Width of Carpet Number of Rolls = 6,480 square feet / 12 feet Number of Rolls = 533 rolls Therefore, to cover all 20 rooms with carpet, you would need approximately 533 rolls of carpet.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 20 feet - 19 feet = 1 foot longer than its width.
Response:  To find out how wide Jessie's room needs to be in order for her to have enough carpeting (10 square feet), we can use the formula: Area = Length x Width. Since the length of the room is given as 5 feet, we can set up an equation: Width = Area / Length. Plugging in the values, we get: Width = 10 / 5 = 2 feet. Therefore, Jessie's room needs to be at least 2 feet wide in order for her to have enough carpeting.
Response:  To find out how many feet long Jessie's room needs to be in order to cover it with a carpet that is 10 square feet, we can use the formula for finding the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since the width of the room is given as 2 feet, we need to find the length of the room. We can do this by dividing the total area by the width: 10 sq ft / 2 ft = 5 ft. Therefore, Jessie's room needs to be at least 5 feet long in order to cover it with a carpet that is 10 square feet.
Response:  To cover the entire floor of Jessie's room with carpet, she will need 18 square feet x 4 feet (length) = 72 square feet of carpet.
"Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the number of T-shirts sold. We know that each T-shirt costs $23 and the total revenue was $230. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

x × $23 = $230

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $23:

x = $230 / $23

x = 10

So, they sold 10 T-shirts."
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $51 / 3 = $17 per shirt.
"Response:  If the store sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and each T-shirt costs $87, then the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game is:

47 x $87 = $3,969

So, the store earned $3,969 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game."
"Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game if 115 were sold during the Arkansas game, we can set up a ratio of the number of T-shirts sold to the total number of T-shirts available for each game. Let's say there are x T-shirts left over after the Arkansas game. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:

x + 115 = 242 (1)

Since there are no T-shirts left over after the Texas Tech game, we know that all 242 T-shirts were sold:

115 + 115 + x = 242 (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 12 (3)

So, 12 T-shirts were left over after the Arkansas game, and 115 were sold during the Arkansas game."
Response:  If the Razorbacks sold 89 T-shirts during their game, their sales for that game would be $8,904 (89 x $98).
Response:  The total revenue from selling T-shirts at the Texas Tech game would be $78 x 186 = $14,392.
"Response:  To find out how much profit the Razorback Shop made from selling T-shirts, we need to subtract the cost of each T-shirt from the revenue generated by selling it. Let's assume that the cost of one T-shirt is $62. If they sold 183 T-shirts, then the total revenue from T-shirt sales would be:

Revenue from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 183 x $62
= $11,466

Now, let's subtract the cost of each T-shirt from the revenue to find the profit:

Profit from T-shirts = Revenue from T-shirts - Cost per T-shirt
= $11,466 - $62
= $11,404

So, the Razorback Shop made a profit of $11,404 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much profit Razorback Shop made from selling Jerseys, we need to calculate the total revenue from jersey sales and subtract the cost of jerseys. Let's do it step by step:  
Revenue from T-shirt sales = 74 x $67 = $5,038  
Revenue from Jersey sales = 156 x $165 = $25,940  
Total Revenue = $5,038 + $25,940 = $30,978  
Cost of Jerseys = 156 x $165 = $25,940  
Profit from Jersey Sales = Total Revenue - Cost of Jerseys = $30,978 - $25,940 = $5,038"
"Response:  The T-shirt is more expensive than the jersey. Let's calculate the profit from each item sold:

Profit from T-shirts = (Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt) - Cost per T-shirt
= (157 x $192) - ($192 x 157)
= $28,604 - $29,536
= $932

Profit from Jerseys = (Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey) - Cost per Jersey
= (19 x $34) - ($34 x 19)
= $616 - $636
= $20

Since the profit from the T-shirts is higher than the profit from the Jerseys, we can conclude that the T-shirt is more expensive than the jersey."
Response:  The jerseys were more expensive than the T-shirts by $232 - $86 = $146 per item.
"Response:  The total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is calculated as follows:

Total sales = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 130 x $51
= $6,430

Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is $6,430."
Response:  The amount of money earned by selling T-shirts = (Number of T-shirts x Original price per T-shirt) + (Number of T-shirts x Increase in price per T-shirt).  Calculation:  Number of T-shirts = 14  Original price per T-shirt = $201  Increase in price per T-shirt = $217 - $201 = $16  Amount of money earned = (14 x $201) + (14 x $16)  = $2844 + $224  = $3068
Response:  The number of T-shirts sold by Razorback's T-shirt shop during the game between Arkansas State and Texas A&M University is 60 / 10 = 6.
Response:  The price of one T-shirt is $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt.
"Response:  To find out how much profit they made from selling T-shirts, we need to calculate the total amount of money they received from selling T-shirts and then subtract the cost of producing each T-shirt. Let's start by calculating the total amount of money they received from selling T-shirts:  
Total amount of money received from selling T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt Total amount of money received from selling T-shirts = 20 x $215 = $4,300 Now, let's calculate the cost of producing each T-shirt: Cost of producing each T-shirt = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt Cost of producing each T-shirt = 20 x $15 = $300 Therefore, the profit from selling T-shirts is: Profit from selling T-shirts = Total amount of money received - Cost of producing each T-shirt Profit from selling T-shirts = $4,300 - $300 = $4,000 So, they made a profit of $4,000 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much profit was made from selling jerseys, we need to know how many jerseys were sold and at what price. Let's assume that each jersey was sold for $76. If they sold 2 jerseys, then the total revenue from jerseys would be:  
Revenue from Jerseys = 2 x $76 = $152 
Now, let's calculate the cost of producing and selling the jerseys. We are given that T-shirts were sold at $204 per unit. So, if they sold 158 T-shirts, the total revenue from T-shirts would be:  
Revenue from T-Shirts = 158 x $204 = $31,992 
Total Revenue = Revenue from Jerseys + Revenue from T-Shirts = $152 + $31,992 = $32,144 
To find out the profit, we need to subtract the cost of production and sales from the total revenue. Let's assume that the cost of producing and selling one jersey is $50 (this includes materials, labor, and other expenses). The cost of producing and selling one T-shirt is $100 (again, this includes materials, labor, and other expenses). So, the total cost of producing and selling all the items would be:  
Total Cost = 2 x $50 + 158 x $100 = $100 + $15,800 = $15,900 
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $32,144 - $15,900 = $16,244 
Therefore, the profit from selling jerseys alone would be:  
Profit from Jerseys = Total Revenue - Cost of Producing and Selling Jerseys = $152 - $50 = $102"
Response:  Tシャツの値段 = 240 x 177 + 210 x 23 = $45,880 + $4,630 = $50,510.
Response:  The jerseys are more expensive than the T-shirts by $90 (115 - 25 = 90).
Response:  There would be 50 chairs (10 x 5) more than tables.
Response:  Each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  The number of sets of tables that they have is equal to the number of chairs in the backyard minus the number of chairs already occupied by the guests. In this case, there are 9 chairs in the backyard and each set of tables has 3 chairs, so they will need 9 - 3 = 6 sets of tables.
Response:  The party guests have 13 x 11 = 143 chairs in total.
Response:  There are 5 unused chairs in total if there are 11 people sitting at the table and each set of tables has 6 chairs.
Response:  The total number of guest chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  The hosts need to buy 4 chairs (3 x 4 = 12) for each of the four tables, for a total of 48 chairs.
Response:  The number of chairs is 14 x 9 = 126 chairs.
"Response:  $92 (calculation below)

Question: What is the daily wage of Louis if he works for 5 weeks and earns a total of $460?

Answer: $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks)."
Response:  The harvest lasted for 8 weeks, since Louis earned $16 per week and the total harvest was $1216.
"Response:  After 216 weeks (or 4 years) of working and earning $21 per week, Louis will have earned a total of:

21 x 216 = $4592

Subtracting the amount he paid in taxes ($702):

$4592 - $702 = $3890

Therefore, after 4 years of work, Louis will have $3890 left over."
"Response:  If Louis works for 73 seasons (223 weeks x 1357 dollars per week), he will earn a total of:

223 weeks x 1357 dollars/week = 298,411 dollars

Therefore, if Louis works for 73 seasons, he will earn approximately 298,411 dollars."
"Response:  If Louis works overtime every week during the harvest season (1091 weeks), he will earn an additional $939 x 52 = $48,768 from overtime pay. Therefore, his total income for the harvest season will be:

$28/week x 1091 weeks + $48,768 = $31,528 + $48,768 = $79,296

So, Louis's total income for the harvest season is $79,296."
"Response:  During the harvest period of 233 weeks, Louis will earn $403 per week, and he pays $49 per week in rent. Therefore, his total income during the harvest period is:

$403 x 233 = $91,590

And his net income after paying rent is:

$91,590 - $49 x 233 = $91,590 - $11,677 = $80,913"
Response:  During the harvest period of 1359 weeks, Louis will pay $388 per week in rent, for a total of $52,472.
Response:  After 1181 weeks (which is approximately 23 years), Louis will have $57,049 left ($491 per week x 1181 weeks - $216 per week x 1181 weeks).

"Response:  If Dean's height is 9 feet and the water depth is 10 times his height, then the water depth would be:

Water depth = 10 x 9 = 90 feet deep"
Response:  If Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, and Ron is 14 feet tall, then Ron's height is 14 + 8 = 22 feet. The depth of the water would be 2 times Dean's height, which is 2 x 22 = 44 feet.
Response:  If Ron is 12 feet tall and Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, then Dean's height would be 12 - 11 = 1 foot taller than Ron. So, if Ron stands at 12 feet, Dean would stand at 13 feet (12 + 1). Now, we need to find out how deep the water is based on their heights. We know that the depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height, so we can calculate it as follows: Depth of water = 5 x 12 = 60 feet. Therefore, the water is 60 feet deep.
"Response:  If Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, and the water is 15 times Dean's height, then the depth of the water would be:

15 x (Dean's height + Ron's height) = 15 x (7 + 4) = 15 x 11 = 165 feet

So, the depth of the water would be approximately 165 feet."
"Response:  If Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron and Ron is 13 feet tall, then Dean's height would be:
Dean's height = Ron's height + 9 feet
= 13 feet + 9 feet
= 22 feet

Now, we need to find out how deep the water is based on Ron's height. We know that the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. So, if Ron is 13 feet tall, the depth of the water would be:
Depth of water = 16 x 13 feet
= 16 x 13 x 12 inches/foot
= 2048 inches

Therefore, the depth of the water is approximately 2048 inches or 170 feet."
Response:  The water's depth is 9 x 6 = 54 feet (since Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron).

Response:  If there are 45 flowerbeds and each flowerbed has 10 varieties of flowers, then the total number of varieties of flowers planted is 45 x 10 = 450.
Response:  If each flowerbed has the same number of seeds, and there are 9 flowerbeds with a total of 45 seeds, then each flowerbed has 45/9 = 5 seeds.
Response:  The mother and son had 36 species of flowers in total. Since each flowerbed contained 12 species, they had 36/12 = 3 flowerbeds.
"Response:  To find out how many flowers were grown in total, we need to multiply the number of flowerbeds by the number of seeds planted in each flowerbed and then add up all these products. Therefore, the total number of flowers is:

55 (seeds per flowerbed) x 15 (number of flowerbeds) = 825

So, they grew 825 flowers in total."
Response:  If each flowerbed can hold 10 seeds and they planted 60 seeds in total, then they had 6 flowerbeds (6 x 10 = 60).
Response:  Each flowerbed has 4 types of flowers planted in it, so each flowerbed has 4 x 8 = 32 plants.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends two crackers, then he would have given a total of 22 crackers (11 x 2 = 22). Therefore, Matthew had 22 crackers left after giving them away.
Response:  If Matthew gave 8 crackers to his friends and gave each friend two crackers, then he had 4 friends.
Response:  Each of Matthew's five friends ate 3 crackers (5 friends x 3 crackers per friend = 15 crackers).
"Response:  Matthew gave each of his three friends an equal number of crackers, and he had 17 crackers left over. Let x be the number of crackers that Matthew gave to each friend. Since there are three friends, we can write the equation:

x + x + x = 17...(1)

Since each friend received an equal number of crackers, we can simplify the equation by adding all three equations together:

3x = 17...(2)

Now solve for x in equation (2):

x = 5...(3)

Therefore, Matthew gave each of his three friends 5 crackers."
"Response:  If Matthew distributed 22 crackers and 34 cookies equally among 11 friends, then each friend would receive:

22 / 11 = 2 crackers per person
34 / 11 = 3 cookies per person"
Response:  Each person ate 10 pieces of cake (29/3 = 10).
"Response:  If Matthew distributed the crackers and cakes equally among his 7 friends, then each friend would receive:

* 14 crackers / 7 people = 2 crackers per person
* 21 cakes / 7 people = 3 cakes per person

Therefore, each of Matthew's friends ate 2 crackers and 3 cakes."
"Response:  If there are 36 crackers and Matthew distributed them equally among his 18 friends, then each friend received:  
36 / 18 = 2 crackers per person"
Response:  If Matthew had 36 crackers and gave one to each of his six friends, he would have given out 6 x 36 = 216 crackers in total.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of crackers that Matthew gave to each friend as x. Since there are three friends in total, we have:

x + x + x = 23 (total number of crackers)

Since each friend received the same amount of crackers, we can write:

x = 7 (since 7 x 3 = 21, and 21 is the remaining number of crackers after giving 23 to three friends)

Therefore, each friend ate 7 crackers."
"Response:  Matthew gave 5 people an equal number of crackers, and he had 23 crackers left over. Let's say he gave each person x crackers. Then, we can set up the equation:

x + (5 x) = 23

Simplifying the equation:

6x = 23

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 4

Therefore, Matthew gave each of his 5 friends 4 crackers."
Response:  Each person ate 8 crackers (32/4 = 8).
"Response:  Each person ate 2 pieces of cake.

Question:  5人の友達が同じ質量のボールを持っていると仮定しましょう。彼らはそれぞれのボールを投げ合わせました。ボールAは最も高く飛びました。どのような高さで飛んだでしょうか？ 
Based on the information given, formulate an algebraic expression for the height of Ball A.  Answer: The height of Ball A can be represented as h = (5x + 5y) meters, where x and y are the distances thrown by each of the other four friends."
Response:  Let's denote the number of crackers and cakes eaten by each person as C and K, respectively. Since Matthew gave out the same number of crackers and cakes to all his friends, we know that C + K = 13 + 15 = 28. Moreover, since each friend ate both crackers and cakes, we have C + K = 2(C + K). Therefore, we can solve for C and K as follows: C = K = 14. So each friend ate 14 crackers and 14 cakes.

"Response:  To determine how much wax is needed for the wings, we need to know the weight of one wing. Let's assume that each wing has the same weight. The question states that there are five wings, so we can multiply the weight of one wing by five to get the total weight of all wings. We also know that the total amount of wax required is 17 grams, so we can subtract this from the weight of one wing to find out how much wax is needed for each wing.

Let's start by calculating the weight of one wing:

Weight of one wing = Total weight of all wings / Number of wings
= 557 g / 5
= 111 g per wing

Now, let's calculate the amount of wax needed for each wing:

Amount of wax needed for each wing = Total weight of all wings - Total amount of wax required
= 111 g - 17 g
= 94 g per wing

Therefore, each wing requires 94 grams of wax."
"Response:  To determine how much more wax is needed, we need to subtract the amount of wax currently held (11g) from the total amount required for the wings (492g). Therefore, the remaining amount of wax needed is:  
492g - 11g = 481g"
"Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes are harvested per day, we need to divide the total number of drums by the number of days it takes to harvest them. In this case, there are 90 drums and they will be harvested in 6 days, so:  

90 drums / 6 days = 15 drums per day"
Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes can be harvested per day, we need to divide the total number of grapes harvested (90 drums) by the number of days it took to harvest them (5 days). Therefore, the daily grape harvest is:  90 drums / 5 days = 18 drums/day
Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes will be harvested in 146 days, we need to know the number of grapes that each worker can pick in one day and the total number of workers. Let's use the information given in the problem: Each worker can pick 244 drums of grapes per day and there are 294 workers. Therefore, the total number of grapes that can be picked in one day is: 244 x 294 = 70,832 drums So, if they work for 146 days, they will have picked: 70,832 x 146 = 10,515,520 drums of grapes.
Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes will be harvested in 77 days, we need to know how much each person can harvest per day and how many people are working. Let's use the information given: 100 drums of raspberries and 221 drums of grapes can be harvested by 235 workers in one day. We can assume that each worker can harvest the same amount of both fruits, so let's divide the total amount of each fruit by the number of workers: Raspberries: 100 drums / 235 workers = 0.43 drums/worker (rounded to two decimal places) Grapes: 221 drums / 235 workers = 0.94 drums/worker (rounded to two decimal places) Now, let's calculate how many drums of each fruit will be harvested in 77 days: Raspberries: 0.43 drums/worker x 77 days = 33.41 drums (rounded to two decimal places) Grapes: 0.94 drums/worker x 77 days = 73.68 drums (rounded to two decimal places) So, in 77 days, there will be approximately 33.41 drums of raspberries and 73.68 drums of grapes harvested.
"Response:  To find out how many drums of grapes will be harvested in 58 days, we need to know the number of grapes that can be harvested per day and the total number of days for which the harvesting continues. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
* The farmer harvests 108 drums of grapes per day (given as 1day x 108 drums). 
* He has been harvesting for 57 days already (given as 57days). 
To calculate the total number of drums of grapes harvested so far, we multiply the number of drums harvested per day by the number of days he has been harvesting: Total drums harvested = Number of drums/day x Number of days = 108 drums/day x 57 days = 6,096 drums (rounded to the nearest whole number) Now, let's calculate the remaining number of days for which the harvesting will continue: Remaining days = Total days - Days harvested so far = 58 days - 57 days = 1 day So, the farmer will harvest for one more day. Therefore, the total number of drums of grapes that will be harvested in 58 days is: Total drums harvested in 58 days = Total drums harvested so far + Drums harvested in one day left = 6,096 drums + 108 drums = 6,204 drums (rounded to the nearest whole number)"
"Response:  To calculate how many days it would take to harvest 240 drums of grapes if each person can harvest 8 drums per day, we need to divide the total number of drums by the number of drums that each person can harvest per day. Therefore, we have:  

240 drums / 8 drums/person/day = 30 people/day (round up to the nearest whole number)

So, it would take 30 people 3 days to harvest 240 drums of grapes."
Response:  There are 26 water tanks and each tank contains the same number of saltwater organisms, which is 52 in total. Therefore, there are 52/26 = 2 saltwater organisms in each water tank.

Therefore, there are 2 cookies in each bag of cookies."
Response:  There are 25 households in each block if one block has 5 junk mail deliveries and each household receives 25 pieces of mail.
"Response:  The number of junk mail pieces to be delivered in each block with 20 houses is calculated as follows: 

Number of junk mail pieces per house x Number of houses in each block = Total number of junk mail pieces to be delivered in each block

Since the question states that there are 9 junk mail pieces per house, we can calculate the total number of junk mail pieces to be delivered in each block as follows:

9 (junk mail pieces per house) x 20 (houses in each block) = 180 junk mail pieces per block

Therefore, for each block with 20 houses, 180 junk mail pieces need to be delivered."
Response:  Each house in the block should receive 4 pieces of junk mail (24 / 6 houses = 4).
Response:  There are 7 houses in each block since the postman needs to deliver 2 junk mails to each of the 7 houses.
"Response:  Each block has 20 houses, and each house receives 32 pieces of junk mail, so the total number of pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each block is:

20 houses x 32 pieces/house = 640 pieces of junk mail per block."
Response:  The number of junk mail pieces to be delivered to each house in one block is 19 x 30 = 570 pieces.
Response:  There are 4 houses in each block if the postman delivers 32 pieces of mail to each block.
Response:  To deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 12 houses in each of the 81 blocks, we need to distribute 4 x 12 = 48 pieces of junk mail per block, for a total of 48 x 81 = 3768 pieces of junk mail.
Response:  To deliver junk mail to each of the 17 houses in each of the 16 blocks, we need to distribute 17 x 16 = 272 pieces of junk mail in total.
Response:  There will be 4 groups with 5 items each (10 eggs + 20 stones).
Response:  There will be 3 groups of eggs each containing 5 eggs, since 10 (number of beads) divided by 3 (groups) is equal to 5 (eggs per group).
Response:  If Rebecca has 11 groups of eggs and each group contains two eggs, then she has a total of 22 eggs (11 x 2 = 22).
Response:  Each group will have 2 eggs and 1 marble.
Response:  To divide the collection of eggs into three groups so that each group has an equal number of eggs, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 15. The LCM is 60. Therefore, each group will have 60/3 = 20 eggs.
Response:  There will be 3 groups of eggs each containing 6 eggs, for a total of 3 x 6 = 18 groups.
Response:  There will be 3 groups of eggs, with each group containing 3 eggs. The remaining egg (the 9th egg) will not be used in any of the groups.
Response:  Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. She wants to divide the eggs into 5 groups. To do this, she will need at least 4 eggs in each group (since there are 5 groups). Therefore, Rebecca has 20 - 4 = 16 more eggs than marbles.
Response:  Rebecca has 12 eggs and 5 beads, so she has 12 - 5 = 7 eggs more than beads.

Response:  To determine how many wooden planks are needed for the wall of John's house, we need to divide the total number of nails used by two (since each plank requires two nails). Therefore, the number of wooden planks required is:  4 nails / 2 = 2 planks.
Response:  To build the wall of the house, John will need 13 x 17 = 221 nails in total for the large wooden planks and 8 x (number of small wooden pieces) nails for the small wooden pieces. Therefore, John needs 221 + (8 x number of small wooden pieces) nails in total to build the wall of the house.
Response:  To determine how many boards are needed for the wall of John's house, we need to use the information that each board requires three nails and there are eight nails left over after attaching all the boards. Let X be the number of boards required. Since each board needs three nails, the total number of nails required is 3X. We know that 8 nails are left over, so we can set up the equation:  3X = 8 + X. Solving this equation, we get:  2X = 8. X = 4. Therefore, four boards are required for the wall of John's house.
Response:  To build the wall of the house using both large and small wooden planks, John will need a total of 15 + 5 = 20 nails.
Response:  To determine how many nails are needed for John's wall, we need to know how many boards he is using and how many nails each board requires. The problem states that John is using 16 boards and each board needs two nails. Therefore, the total number of nails required for John's wall is:  16 boards x 2 nails/board = 32 nails
Response:  To determine how many boards are needed for the wall of John's house, we need to calculate the total number of nails required and then divide that by the number of nails per board. Let's start with the given information: Total number of nails = 74 x 8 = 612 nails Since each board has 74 nails, we can calculate the number of boards as follows: Number of boards = Total number of nails / Number of nails per board Number of boards = 612 / 74 = 8 boards Therefore, John will need 8 boards for his house's walls.
"Response:  To build the wall of the house, John will need 12 large wooden planks and 17 small wooden planks. The number of planks required can be calculated as follows:

Large wooden planks: Each large plank requires 14 nails, so for 12 planks, we need 12 x 14 = 168 nails.
Small wooden planks: Each small plank requires 25 nails, so for 17 planks, we need 17 x 25 = 425 nails.

Therefore, in total, John will need 168 + 425 = 693 nails to build the wall of the house."

Response:  Based on the information provided, Lucy bought 23 packs of cookies and some number of cake packs. Let's say she bought x cake packs. Since she had a total of 27 packages of food, we can set up the equation:  23 + x = 27. Solving for x gives us:  x = 4. Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packs of cake in addition to the 23 packs of cookies.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake for a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packs of food items. Since she had 56 pieces left over, each pack must have contained 56 / 14 = 4 pieces per pack. Therefore, Lucy bought 4 x 14 = 56 packets of food in total.

"Response:  The number of students who participated in the program was 521, and there were 174 parents involved. To find out how many more students than parents were involved, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of students:

521 - 174 = 347

So, there were 347 more students than parents involved in the program."
Response:  The program had 61 parents and 177 students, with 44 seats available. Therefore, 61 + 177 = 238 people participated in the program.

"Response:  To find out how many Skittles and erasers are in each group if they are divided into 154 groups, we need to divide 4502 (Skittles) + 4276 (erasers) by 154. 

4502 + 4276 = 8778 

8778 / 154 = 57 

So, there will be 57 groups of Skittles and erasers, with approximately 57 x 3 = 171 Skittles and erasers in each group."
Response:  The size of each group of erasers (4950 / 3941) = approximately 1.26 groups.
