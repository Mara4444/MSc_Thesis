Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 18 children on Monday and with 10 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, let's do that:  18 - 10 =?  The difference between the two numbers is... 8! That means Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played hide and seek with 11 children in Monday. Secondly, she played hide and seek with 12 children in Tuesday. Now let's compare these numbers. We can see that 12 is greater than 11. So, Julia played more children in Tuesday than in Monday. The difference between them is 1 child. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 5 children on Monday. So, if she played with x children on Tuesday, we can set up the equation:  5 + x = 15 (since there were 15 children in total). Solving for x, we get:  x = 10. Therefore, Julia played hide and seek with 10 children on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 16 children in total. On Tuesday, she played with 14 children. So, how many children did she play with on Monday?   To find out, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the total number of children she played with:  16 - 14 = 2  Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 16 children in total on Monday. If she played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday, then the number of children she played with on Tuesday must be less than 16. Since we are told that she played with 12 more children on Monday than on Tuesday, this means that she played with 16 - 12 = 4 children on Tuesday.   Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 14 children in total (2 days x 7 children per day). On Monday, she played with 8 more children than on Tuesday, so on Monday, she played with 7 + 8 = 15 children. Therefore, on Monday, Julia played hide and seek with 15 children.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played hide and seek with 17 children on Monday (M), 15 children on Tuesday (T), and 2 children on Wednesday (W). So far, so good! Now, let's add up all these numbers to find out how many children she played with in total: M + T + W =?  17 + 15 + 2 =?  34 + 2 = 36 children.  Therefore, Julia played hide and seek with 36 children altogether.
Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  15 + 18 = 33  Therefore, Julia played with 33 children in total during those two days.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 5 children on Monday (P), 9 children on Tuesday (T), and 15 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many children she played with each day, we can set up the following equation: P + T + W = 5 + 9 + 15. Simplifying this equation, we get:  2P + 3T = 24. Now, let's solve for P and T. We have:  2P + 3T = 24  P + 3T = 12  P = 6  T = 4 So, Julia played with 6 children on Monday and 4 children on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 2 children on Monday, with 14 children on Tuesday, and with 16 children on Wednesday. To find out how many children she played with on Tuesday and Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the total number of children she played with on each day.  
Tuesday: Total children = 2 + 14 = 16 Children played with = 16 - 2 = 14 
Wednesday: Total children = 2 + 16 = 18 Children played with = 18 - 2 = 16 
Therefore, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and 16 children on Wednesday."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Julia played with 9 children in Monday and 7 children in Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with in Monday and Tuesday is:  9 - 7 = 2  Therefore, Julia played with 2 more children in Monday than in Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday (M), 2 children on Tuesday (T), and 8 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, we can set up an equation like this: M - W =?  In other words, how many more children did Julia play with on Monday than on Wednesday?  Now let's substitute the numbers we know into the equation:  
M - W = 14 - 8 =?  Can you solve for the missing number?"
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday.   So, let's do that:  11 - 9 =?  Yes, that's right! Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
"Response:  First, we know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday (M), 18 children on Tuesday (T), and 7 children on Wednesday (W). Now, let's find out how many more children she played with on M and T than on W. To do this, subtract the number of children she played with on W from the number of children she played with on M and T.  

So, to find out how many more children Julia played with on M than on W, we can subtract:  

18 - 7 = 11 

This means that Julia played with 11 more children on Monday than on Wednesday.  Similarly, to find out how many more children she played with on T than on W, we can subtract:  

15 - 7 = 8 

This means that Julia played with 8 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.  So, in total, Julia played with 11 + 8 = 19 more children on Monday and Tuesday combined than she did on Wednesday."
Response:  First, she played with 13 children on Monday and then with 10 children on Tuesday. So, in total, Julia played with  13 + 10 = 23 children. On Wednesday, she played with 15 children, so the total number of children Julia played with is 23 + 15 = 38 children.
Response:  First, Julia played hide and seek with 7 children on Monday (M) and with 13 children on Tuesday (T). So, we can write: M + T =? Total number of children she played with. Now, on Wednesday (W), she played cards with 20 children. Therefore, we have: W = M + T + 20. Substituting M = 7 and T = 13, we get: W = 7 + 13 + 20 = 40. So, in total, Julia played with 40 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 12 children on Monday and with 14 children on Tuesday. So, in total, she played with  12 + 14 = 26 children.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 19 children on Monday and with 18 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday.  19 - 18 =?  Yes, that's right! Julia played with 1 more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played hide and seek with 6 children on Monday (M) and with 5 children on Tuesday (T). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, we can set up an equation as follows: M - T =?  In other words, we want to find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than she did on Tuesday.   Now let's substitute the numbers we know into our equation:  M - T = 6 - 5 =?  Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday and with some other number of children on Tuesday.  To find out how many children she played with on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the total number of children.   Total number of children = 18 Children Played with on Monday = 4 children Number of children played with on Tuesday = Total number of children - Number of children played with on Monday = 18 - 4 = 14 So, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Wednesday and with 6 children on Monday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday.   So, if we let X be the number of children Julia played with on Monday, then she played with X - 4 children on Wednesday. Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:  X - 4 =?  Since we are asked to find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we want to find the difference between the two numbers. In other words, we want to find X - 4.  Can you solve for X?  What is your answer?
"Response:  Firstly, Bobbie ate several pieces of candy, and then he ate another 25 pieces. In total, he ate 43 candies. Now let's find out how many pieces of candy Bobbie ate at first. We know that he ate several pieces, but we don't know exactly how many. So, let's use the word ""several"" to represent an unknown number. Several is more than two but less than ten. For simplicity, let's assume that Bobbie ate five pieces of candy initially. Therefore, if he ate five pieces of candy initially, he would have eaten 25 + 5 = 30 pieces of candy in total. This means that Bobbie ate 30 - 5 = 25 pieces of candy initially."
Response:  First, Bobbi ate 28 candies. Then he ate an additional 42 candies. In total, Bobbi ate  28 + 42 = 70 candies.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 33 pieces of candy. Then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobby ate  33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Now, let's talk about chocolate. Bobby ate 14 pieces of chocolate. In total, Bobby ate  37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 38 candies and then he ate  36 more. So in total, he ate 38 + 36 = 74 candies. Now let's look at how many chocolates he ate. He ate 16 chocolates. To find out how much more candy than chocolate Bobby ate, we need to subtract the number of chocolates from the total number of candies he ate. We can do this by subtracting 16 from 74. This gives us: 74 - 16 = 58. Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more candies than chocolates.
"Response:  First, Bobbi had 20 candies and he ate 34 of them. So, how many candies did Bobbi have left after eating 34 of them?   To find out, we can subtract 34 from 20.  20 - 34 =?  Can you do this subtraction in your head or on paper?  What is the result?  Now, Bobbi ate another 18 candies. How many candies does Bobbi have left now?  We need to add 18 to the number of candies Bobbi had left after eating 34.  What is the result of adding 18 to the previous result?  Think about it for a moment... The answer is...  20 - 34 + 18 =?  Can you solve this addition problem in your head or on paper?  What is the final answer to the question ""How many candies did Bobbi eat?"""
Response:  First, Bobbi had 21 candies and he ate 5 of them. So, how many candies does he have left?  5 + 9 = 14. That means Bobbi has 14 candies left.
"Response:  First, Bobbi had 22 candies. He ate some of them, so he has 8 left. How many did he eat? We know that he ate 5 more after eating some. So, in total, he ate 5 + (some) = 5 + x. Since he has 8 left, we can set up an equation: 5 + x = 8. Solve for x to find out how many candies Bobbi ate at first.   Solution: To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable ""x"" which represents the number of candies Bobbi ate at first. We can start by adding 5 and x: 5 + x =? Now, we are given that 5 + x = 8, so we can substitute 8 into the previous equation: 5 + x = 8. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us: x = 3. Therefore, Bobbi ate 3 candies at first."
Response:  If Bobbi had 19 candies and he ate 2, then how many candies does he have left?  19 - 2 =?  Yes! That's right! Bobbi has 17 candies left.
Response:  If Bobbi had 32 candies and he ate some of them, then the number of candies he ate is equal to the difference between 32 and 20 (the number of candies left). So, we can write an equation:  32 - 20 = x  where x is the number of candies Bobbi ate. Solving for x, we get:  12 = x  Therefore, Bobbi ate 12 candies.
Response:  First, Bobbi ate 17 pieces of candy, so he has 36 - 17 = 19 left. Then, he ate another 15 pieces, so now he has 19 - 15 = 4 left. Therefore, there are 4 pieces of candy left for Bobbi.
Response:  If Bobbi had 30 candies and he ate 23 of them, then he has  30 - 23 = 7 candies left.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons. To find out how many more balloons Allan has than Jake, we need to subtract the number of balloons Jake brought from the number of balloons Allan brought.  5 - 3 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 2. So, Allan has 2 more balloons than Jake in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. To find out how many more balloons Jake has than Allan, we can subtract the number of balloons Allan brought from the number of balloons Jake brought.  2 (Allan) - 3 (Jake) =?  So, Jake has 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balloons, then Jake must have brought  3 - 2 = 1 balloon. So Jake brought one balloon to the park.
Response:  We know that Jake brought 6 air balloons to the park and Allan brought fewer than 4 more balloons than Jake. So we can start with the information that Jake brought 6 balloons.   If Allan brought fewer than 4 more balloons, then he must have brought at least 2 balloons (since 4 is less than 6). Therefore, Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 air balloons to the park and Jake brought more than Allan. So if we let X be the number of air balloons Jake brought, then X > 5 (since Jake brought more than Allan). Now we can write an equation based on this information:  5 + X = 6  Solving for X gives us:  X = 11  Therefore, Jake brought 11 air balloons to the park.
"Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 3 air balloons and Jake brought 5 air balloons to the park. So, if we write this down as an equation:  
A = 3 (Allan's balloons) 
J = 5 (Jake's balloons)  Now, we are told that Allan bought 2 more balloons in the park. So, we can add 2 to his original number of balloons:  
A + 2 = 3 + 2  Simplify:  
A + 2 = 5  Therefore, Allan had 5 balloons in the park. As for Jake, he had 5 balloons initially, so he still has 5 balloons in the park.  The final answer is:  A = 5 (Allan's balloons), J = 5 (Jake's balloons)."
"Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 2 air balloons and Jake brought 4 air balloons to the park. So, initially, Jake had more air balloons than Allan in the park.  
Now, Allan bought 3 more air balloons in the park, so he has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 air balloons. 
On the other hand, Jake still has 4 air balloons. Therefore, Allan has more air balloons than Jake in the park after buying additional ones."
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. So, initially, Jake had more balloons than Allan in the park.   Next, we are told that Allan bought 3 more balloons in the park. Therefore, after Allan purchased additional balloons, he had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in the park.  Now, let's compare the number of balloons Jake had with the number of balloons Allan had in the park:   Jake had 6 balloons (initially) - 5 balloons (that Allan had after purchasing additional balloons) = 1 balloon more than Allan had in the park.  So, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 5 air balloons to the park and Jake brought 4 air balloons. So together they have  5 + 4 = 9 air balloons. Then it says that Allan bought 3 more air balloons in the park, so now he has  5 + 3 = 8 air balloons. Therefore, Allan brought 8 air balloons to the park.
Response:  First, Allan brought 6 air balloons to the park and Jake brought 2 air balloons. So, at first, Allan had more air balloons than Jake (6 - 2 = 4). Then, Jake bought 3 more air balloons in the park, so he now has 2 + 3 = 5 air balloons. Therefore, Allan still has more air balloons than Jake (6 > 5), but not as many as before (6 - 2 = 4 vs. 5).
Response:  First, Allan brought 6 air balloons to the park, so he had 6 balloons in total.   Next, Jake brought 3 air balloons and bought 4 more at the park, so he had 3 + 4 = 7 balloons in total. Therefore, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  First, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park. Then Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park, so he had a total of 5 + 3 = 8 balloons.   Therefore, Jake brought 8 balloons to the park.
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 3 air balloons and 20 balls to the park. So, if we write down what we know so far, it would look like this:  3 + 20 =?  Now, let's move on to Jake. We know he brought 5 air balloons and 59 balls to the park. So, if we add up all of the information we have so far, it would look like this:  3 + 20 + 5 + 59 =?  Can you solve for the total number of air balloons and balls in the park?
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 7 air balloons and 5 balls to the park. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:  7 + 5 = 12  Now, let's look at what Jake brought. We know he brought 6 air balloons and 4 balls to the park. If we add up these numbers, we get:  6 + 4 = 10  Since both Allan and Jake brought their items to the park, they must have had a total of 12 + 10 = 22 items in the park!
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and together with Jake they brought 6 balloons to the park. So, we can say that Jake brought  6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan. Therefore, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  First, Allan brought 2 air balloons to the park and then bought 3 more there. So, in total, Allan has 2 + 3 = 5 air balloons in the park. Now, we know that Jake brought 6 air balloons to the park. Therefore, the number of air balloons Jake has is greater than the number of air balloons Allan has in the park. Specifically, Jake has 6 > 5 = 1 more air balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese each day. To find out how many more hours he spends on English, we need to subtract the time he spends on Chinese from the time he spends on English.  6 hours - 2 hours =?  Yes, that's right! Rayan spends 4 more hours studying English than he does studying Chinese.
Response:  We know that Ra...
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 4 hours in total studying English and Chinese every day.  If he spends 3 hours studying English, then he must spend  4 - 3 = 1 hour studying Chinese.  So, Rayan spends 1 hour studying Chinese each day.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and x hours studying Chinese. Since he spends 2 more hours studying English than Chinese, we can set up an equation based on this information:  7 + x = 9 (since he spends 2 more hours studying English) Now solve for x:  x = 9 - 7 x = 2 So, Ryan spends 2 hours studying Chinese.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and more than 5 hours studying English. So if he studies English for 2 hours more than Chinese, then he must spend at least 7 hours studying English (since he already spends 5 hours studying Chinese). Therefore, the number of hours Ryan spends studying English is 7 hours.
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese.  If he studies for 5 days, how many total hours will he spend studying both languages?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends each day by the number of days he studies.  For English:  6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours  For Chinese:  7 hours/day x 5 days = 35 hours  So, in total, Rayan will study English for 30 hours and Chinese for 35 hours, for a grand total of 65 hours.
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 2 days, how many hours will he spend studying English in total?   To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends each day studying English by the number of days he is studying. So, if he studies English for 2 days, he will spend:  6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours studying English.  Therefore, Rayan will spend 12 hours studying English over the course of 2 days.
Response:  First, we know that Rayan spends 5 hours per day studying English, so he studies English for 5 x 6 = 30 hours in total. Next, we know that he spends 4 hours per day studying Chinese, so he studies Chinese for 4 x 6 = 24 hours in total. Therefore, the total number of hours Rayan spends studying languages is 30 + 24 = 54 hours.
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. If he studies for 86 days, we can calculate how many total hours he will spend studying each language.   For English:  4 hours/day x 86 days = 344 hours   For Chinese:  6 hours/day x 86 days = 510 hours So, in total, Rayan will study English for 344 hours and Chinese for 510 hours during his 86-day period of study.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Ryan spends studying each language per day.   English: 6 hours Chinese: 7 hours Spanish: 3 hours Now, let's calculate how many hours he spends studying all three languages combined. We can do this by adding up the number of hours he spends studying each language per day.  Total hours = (English hours) + (Chinese hours) + (Spanish hours) Total hours = 6 + 7 + 3 Total hours = 16 So, in total, Ryan spends 16 hours studying all three languages combined per day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Ryan spends studying each language per day.   English: 6 hours Spanish: 58 hours Chinese: 3 hours Now, let's compare the time spent studying English and Chinese. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours spent studying Chinese from the number of hours spent studying English. This will give us the difference between the two.  Difference = English - Chinese  Difference = 6 - 3  Difference = 3 So, Ryan spends 3 more hours studying English than he does studying Chinese.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Ryan spends studying each language per day.   English: 7 hours Spanish: 4 hours Chinese: 2 hours Now, let's compare the time spent studying English and Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the amount of time spent studying Spanish from the amount of time spent studying English.  English - Spanish =?  We know that English takes up 7 hours of his daily study routine, so if he spends 4 hours studying Spanish, then... 7 (English) - 4 (Spanish) =?  So, Ryan spends 3 more hours studying English than he does studying Spanish.
Response:  First, we know that Ra...
Response:  We know that Ra...
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, so he studies for a total of:  4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours studying English  5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours studying Chinese Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 28 + 35 = 63 hours studying both languages.
Response:  Tiffany had 8 bags of cans in one day (Monday). She found 7 more bags of cans the next day. So, she had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of cans in total. Therefore, there were 8 more bags of cans with Tiffany on Monday than she found the next day.
Response:  Tiffany had 7 bags of cans in Monday. If she found 12 more bags on Tuesday, then she has a total of 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans. So, Tiffany found 12 more bags of cans on Tuesday than she had on Monday.
Response:  Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday. If she found more bags on Tuesday, that means she had a total of 4 + x bags, where x is the number of additional bags she found. We know that Tiffany had 6 bags in total, so we can set up an equation:  4 + x = 6  Solving for x, we get:  x = 2  Therefore, Tiffany found 2 additional bags of cans on Tuesday.
Response:  If Tiffany had 8 bags in total and found 4 more bags the next day, then she had 8 + 4 = 12 bags in total. So, on Monday, Tiffany had 12 - 4 = 8 bags. Therefore, Tiffany had 8 bags on Monday.
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 10 bags of cans.  
On Tuesday, she found 3 more bags of cans, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 bags of cans.  
On Wednesday, she found 7 more bags of cans, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags of cans.  Therefore, in total, Tiffany had 20 bags of cans."
"Response: 

Day 1 (Monday): Tiffany had 8 bags of cans. 

Day 2 (Tuesday): She found 10 more bags of cans. So, she had 8 + 10 = 18 bags of cans. 

Day 3 (Wednesday): She found 4 more bags of cans. So, she had 18 + 4 = 22 bags of cans. 

Therefore, Tiffany found 22 bags of cans after Monday."
Response:  First, Tiffany had 3 bags of cans and no bottles. Next day she found 7 more bags of cans and 44 bottles. So in total, Tiffany has:  3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans And 44 bottles. Therefore, there are 10 x 5 = 50 cans in total.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red persimmons and 16 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more red persimmons than green persimmons, we need to subtract the number of green persimmons from the number of red persimmons.  17 - 16 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 1 more red persimmon than green persimon in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red persimmons and 11 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more green persimmons than red persimmons, we need to subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons.   Total number of persimmons = 5 + 11 = 16 So, there are 16 persimmons in all. Now let's subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons:  16 - 5 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red persimmons in the basket and some green ones too. So if we subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons, we will get the number of green persimmons.  15 - 10 =?  Yes! That gives us 5 green persimmons in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red persimmons in the basket and some green ones. If there are more green than red, then we can say that the number of green persimmons is at least 3 + x, where x is the number of additional green persimmons. Since there are 10 more green persimmons than red, we have:  3 + x = 10 + 3 4 = x  Therefore, there are 7 more green persimmons than red. So, if there are 3 red persimmons, there will be 3 + 7 = 10 green persimmons in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 7 red persimmons, so let's add 7 to our total. Next, we have 15 yellow persimmons, so let's add 15 to our total. Finally, we have 8 green persimmons, so let's add 8 to our total. Therefore, the total number of persimmons in the basket is:  7 + 15 + 8 = 30
Response:  We know that there are 7 red persimmons and 71 yellow persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more green persimmons than red persimmons, we need to subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons.   Total Persimmons = Red + Yellow + Green  Total Persimmons = 7 + 71 + 8  Total Persimmons = 86  Now let's subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons:   Green Persimmons = Total - Red  Green Persimmons = 86 - 7  Green Persimmons = 79  So, there are 79 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that there are 2 red persimmons and 6 yellow persimmons in total. So, if we subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons, we get:  6 + 2 = 8  Now, let's find out how many green persimmons there are. We know that there are 14 green persimmons in total. So, if we divide the total number of persimmons by the number of green persimmons, we get:  8 / 14 = 0.57 (or approximately 57%) Therefore, there are more green persimmons than yellow persimmons in the basket.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many more red persimmons there are than yellow persimmons. To do this, subtract the number of yellow persimmons from the total number of red persimmons:  19 (red) - 11 (yellow) =?  Next, let's add the number of green persimmons to both sides of the equation to see if it helps us get closer to our final answer:  19 (red) - 11 (yellow) + 12 (green) =?  Now, can you use these equations to determine how many more red persimmons there are in the basket compared to yellow persimmons?
Response:  First, we know that there are 6 red persimmons in the basket. Next, we know that there are 90 yellow persimmons in the basket. Finally, we know that there are 16 green persimmons in the basket. To find out how many red and green persimmons there are in total, let's add the number of each type of persimmon together:  6 + 90 + 16 = 102 So, there are 102 persimmons in the basket in total. Now, to find out how many red and green persimmons there are, let's divide the total number of persimmons by the number of each type of persimmon:  102 / 6 = 17 (red)  102 / 16 = 6 (green) Therefore, there are 17 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that there are 18 red persimmons in total. Next, we know that there are 14 yellow persimmons in total. Finally, we know that there are 17 green persimmons in total. Now let's add up all of these numbers to find out how many red and yellow persimmons there are altogether:  18 + 14 + 17 = 59 So, there are 59 persimmons in total (red, yellow, and green). To find out how many red and yellow persimmons there are, we can subtract the number of green persimmons from the total number of persimmons:  59 - 17 = 42 Therefore, there are 42 red and yellow persimmons in the basket (42 = 18 + 14 + 9).
Response:  First, we know that there are 5 red persimmons in the basket. Next, we know that there are 14 yellow persimmons in the basket. Finally, we know that there are 6 green persimmons in the basket. So, if we add all of these numbers together, we get:  5 + 14 + 6 = 25 Now, let's check our answer to make sure it makes sense. We have 25 fruits in total, and each fruit is either red, yellow, or green. Therefore, we can conclude that there must be 5 red fruits (since there are 5 red persimmons), 14 yellow fruits (since there are 14 yellow persimmons), and 6 green fruits (since there are 6 green persimmons). In other words, there are 5 red fruits, 14 yellow fruits, and 6 green fruits in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 65 boxes in total and each box contains both red and green persimmons. So we can start by finding out how many red persimmons there are in total. Since each box has 7 red persimmons, we can multiply 65 boxes by 7 to get: Total number of red persimmons =  65 x 7 = 455 Now we need to find out how many green persimmons there are in total. Since each box has 3 green persimmons, we can multiply 65 boxes by 3 to get: Total number of green persimmons =  65 x 3 = 195 Therefore, there are 455 red persimmons and 195 green persimmons in all 65 boxes.
Response:  We know that each basket contains 10 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So if we multiply the number of baskets (11) by the total number of persimmons in each basket (28), we get:  11 x 28 = 318. Therefore, there are 318 persimmons in all the baskets.
Response:  We know that there are 6 corbins with persimmons and each bin has both red and green persimmons. So we need to find out how many red persimmons there are in total.   Since each bin contains 16 red persimmons and there are 6 bins, the total number of red persimmons is:  16 x 6 = 96  Therefore, there are 96 red persimmons in all the bins.
Response:  There are 7 corbins with persimmons in total. Each bin contains  10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So, we can calculate the number of bins as follows: Total number of bins = 7 Number of red persimmons per bin = 10 Number of green persimmons per bin = 2 Therefore, the total number of green persimmons is: Total number of green persimmons = 2 x 7 = 14 Now, let's summarize our findings: There are 7 bins with persimmons in total. Each bin contains 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons, so there are 14 green persimmons in all the bins.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 persimmons in total and each basket has 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons. So we can start by writing down what we know:  7 = 4 + 3 +... + 4 + 3 (where ""..."" represents the number of baskets) Now we need to solve for the number of baskets. To do this, we can add up the number of red and green persimmons in each basket:  4 + 3 = 7 (since there are 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons in each basket) Therefore, there are 2 baskets with persimmons."
Response:  We know that each cor basket contains 4 red persimmons and some green persimmons. Since there are 12 persimmons in total, we can write an equation to represent this information:  4x + y = 12  where x is the number of red persimmons in one basket and y is the number of green persimmons in one basket. Now we need to find out how many green persimmons are in each basket. To do this, we can subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons:  4x + y - 4x = 12 - 4x  This simplifies to:  y = 8  So, there are 8 green persimmons in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 13 red persimmons in the basket and some green ones too. So, if we subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of persimmons, we will get the number of green persimmons.  16 - 13 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 3 green persimmons in the basket.
Response:  First, we know that each basket contains a total of  23 persimmons (19 red and 4 green). Second, there are 15 baskets in total. Therefore, to find out how many persimmons there are altogether, we can multiply the number of baskets by the total number of persimmons in each basket:  15 x 23 = 345. So, there are 345 persimmons in all the baskets.
Response:  We know that in each basket there are 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons. So if we have x baskets, we will have:  4x red persimmons + 6x green persimmons = 10 (total number of persimmons)  Now let's solve for x.  We can start with the equation above:  4x + 6x = 10  Combine like terms:   10x = 10  Divide both sides by 10:    x = 1  Therefore, there is one basket with 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green persimmons and 2 red persimmons in the basket. To find out how many more green persimmons than red persimmons, we need to subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of green persimmons.   Total number of green persimmons = 6 + 60 = 66  Number of red persimmons = 2  So, we can subtract 2 from 66 to get the difference:  Difference = 66 - 2 = 64  Therefore, there are 64 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket.
Response:  If Jerry had 4 figurines on his shelf initially and added some more, then he has a total of 4 + x figurines now, where x is the number of additional figurines he added. Since there are 8 figurines in total on the shelf now, we can set up an equation:  4 + x = 8  To solve for x, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:   x = 8 - 4  x = 4  So Jerry added 4 figurines to his shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had x figurines on his shelf initially and then added 7 more. So, in total, he has x + 7 figurines now. The problem states that there are 10 figurines in total on the shelf, so we can set up an equation: x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Jerry had 3 figurines on his shelf initially.
Response:  First, Jerry had 4 game figures and 22 books on his shelf. Then he added 6 more game figures. So, in total, Jerry has:  4 + 6 = 10 game figures on his shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 5 game figures and 9 books on his shelf. This means he had 5 + 9 = 14 items on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more game figures, so now he has 5 + 9 + 7 = 21 items on his shelf. Therefore, there are 21 - 9 = 12 more game figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 2 toy heroes and 10 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more toy heroes. So, in total, Jerry had  2 + 4 = 6 toy heroes. Now, let's count how many books Jerry had: 10. Therefore, there were more books than toy heroes on Jerry's shelf. Specifically, there were 10 books for every 6 toy heroes.
Response:  First, Jerry had 8 game figures and 9 books on his shelf.  9 + 8 = 17 objects in total.  Later, he added 10 more books to the shelf.  17 + 10 = 27 objects in total.  So there were 27 books on Jerry's shelf after he added 10 new ones.
Response:  First, we know that Jerry had 7 game figures and 2 books on his shelf before he added more books. So, if we write down what we know so far:  7 (game figures) + 2 (books) = 9 Toys + Books on Shelf Now, let's see how many new books Jerry added to his shelf. According to the problem, he added 4 new books. So, we can add 4 to our previous total:  9 (toys + books) + 4 (new books) = 13 Total Number of Items on Shelf Finally, we need to compare the number of games with the number of books to find out which one is greater. In this case, there are 13 items in total, but only 7 game figures. Therefore, the number of books (5) is greater than the number of game figures (7).  Conclusion: There were more books on Jerry's shelf than game figures.
Response:  Jerry had 5 game figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 5 + 2 = 7 game figures and 9 + 2 = 11 books on his shelf. Now, let's compare the number of books with the number of game figures. We have 11 books vs. 7 game figures. The difference between these two numbers is:  11 - 7 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 more books than game figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 8 figurines on his shelf. Then he added 4 more, so now he has:  8 + 4 = 12 figurines. Next, he removed 5 old ones, leaving him with:  12 - 5 = 7 figurines on his shelf. So there are 7 figurines on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  First, Jerry had 3 figurines on his shelf. Then he added 4 more, so now there are 3 + 4 = 7 figurines in total. Finally, Jerry removed some of the old ones, leaving him with 7 - x (where x is the number of figurines he removed) figurines on the shelf. We know that x is less than or equal to 3 because Jerry only removed some of the old figurines and not all of them. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  7 - x <= 3  7 - x >= 0  Solving for x gives us:  x = 2  Therefore, Jerry removed 2 figurines from the shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 7 figurines on his shelf. Then he added some more and removed 10 old ones. So, if he has 8 figurines now, we can calculate how many new ones he added as follows:  8 - 7 =?  The difference between the number of figurines Jerry has now (8) and the number he had before (7) is equal to the number of new figurines he added. Therefore, Jerry added 8 - 7 = 1 figurine to his collection.
Response:  First, Jerry had some figurines on his shelf and then he added two more. So, initially, there were x + 2 figurines on the shelf. Later, he removed 7 old ones, so now there are x + 2 - 7 figurines on the shelf. We know that currently there are 10 figurines on the shelf, so we can set up an equation: x + 2 - 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Jerry had 3 figurines on his shelf initially.
Response:  First, Jerry had 9 figurines on his shelf. Then he added 7 more figurines, so now there are 9 + 7 = 16 figurines in total. Now, we know that Jerry also has 10 books on his shelf. So, if we compare the number of figurines to the number of books, we can see that there are 16 figurines and 10 books. To find out which one is greater, let's subtract the smaller number from the larger number:  16 - 10 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more figurines than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  First, Jerry had 3 books and 4 figurines on his shelf. This means he had 3 + 4 = 7 items on his shelf. Later, he added two more figurines, so now he has 7 + 2 = 9 items on his shelf. Therefore, there are 9 figurines on Jerry's shelf, which is more than the number of books (3) he had initially.
Response:  First, we know that Jerry had 7 books and 3 figurines of heroes on his shelf before he added two more figurines. So, to find out how many books were on the shelf, let's subtract the number of figurines from the total number of items:  7 (books) + 3 (figurines) = 10   Now, when Jerry added two more figurines, there are a total of 10 + 2 = 12 items on the shelf.  To find out how many books are left, we can subtract the new total from the original total:  10 - 12 = -2   Since the result is negative, it means that there are fewer books than figurines on Jerry's shelf after he added two more figurines.  Therefore, the correct answer is:  There are fewer books than figurines on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We know that initially there were two birds sitting on the fence. Then, several more birds flew in and perched alongside them. So, if there are now six birds on the fence in total, we can deduce that two birds were already present (the initial ones), and four more birds have flown in to join them.
Response:  We know that there are 5 pigeons in total now (including the ones that have just joined). Initially, there were x pigeons on the perch. Now, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  5 = x + 4 (since 4 more pigeons have joined) To solve for x, we subtract both sides of the equation by 4:  5 - 4 = x - 4  1 = x So, initially, there were 1 pigeon on the perch.
Response:  We know that there are already 4 pti...
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 pigeons and 2 doves sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:  3 (pigeons) + 2 (doves) + 5 (more birds) = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 3 pigeons and 4 sparrows sitting on the fence initially. Then, two more birds (pigeons or sparrows) join them. To find out how many pigeons are greater than sparrows, we need to subtract the number of sparrows from the total number of birds. Total birds = Pigeons + Sparrows = 3 + 4 = 7 Now, let's subtract the number of sparrows from the total number of birds: Pigeons > Sparrows = 7 - 4 = 3 So, there are three pigeons more than sparrows sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 2 pigeons and 6 storks sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds (pigeons or storks) join them. To find out how many storks are sitting on the fence compared to pigeons, we need to calculate the total number of birds first. So, let's add up all the numbers:  2 + 6 = 8 Now, we have a total of 8 birds. Since there are 3 more birds joining them, we can simply add 3 to the total:   8 + 3 = 11 Now, we have a total of 11 birds sitting on the fence. But wait! We were asked to compare the number of storks to the number of pigeons. Unfortunately, we don't know exactly how many storks and pigeons are sitting on the fence because they are not labeled as such in the problem statement. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there are more storks or pigeons on the fence without additional information.
Response:  We know that there were initially 4 pigeons and 6 eagles sitting on the fence. Then, two more eagles joined them. So, in total, we have:  4 (pigeons) + 6 (eagles) + 2 (additional eagles) = 12 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 pigeons and 4 eagles sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more eagles joined them. So, in total, we have:  3 (pigeons) + 4 (eagles) + 6 (more eagles) =?  To find out how many birds are sitting on the fence altogether, let's add up all the numbers:  3 + 4 + 6 = 13  Therefore, there are 13 birds sitting on the fence!
Response:  We know that there are 6 pigeons and 3 doves on the fence initially. Then, 2 more doves join them. So, in total, we have:  6 (pigeons) + 3 (doves) = 9 birds on the fence. Now, let's count how many doves are on the fence: 3 + 2 = 5 doves. And how many pigeons are on the fence: 6. Therefore, there are 1 more pigeon than dove on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 4 ptiс and 3 eagles sitting on the fence initially. Then, 6 more eagles join them. So, in total, we have:  4 (ptiс) + 3 (eagles) + 6 (more eagles) =? To find out how many eagles are more than birds, we need to subtract the number of birds from the total number of eagles and six more eagles. 4 (ptiс) + 3 (eagles) + 6 (more eagles) - 4 (ptiс) =? Can you solve for the missing value?
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 pigeons sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more pigeons joined them, so now we have:  6 + 4 = 10 pigeons sitting on the fence.  But wait, it gets better! 8 storks also joined the party, bringing the total number of birds to:  10 (pigeons) + 8 (storks) = 18 birds sitting on the fence.  So, in total, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 2 pigeons and 5 birds (not including the doves) sitting on the fence initially. So, in total, we have:  2 + 5 = 7 birds sitting on the fence. Now, 4 doves join them. Therefore, the total number of birds now is:  7 + 4 = 11 birds. Since there are only 4 doves, all the other birds must be pigeons or other types of birds. So, the number of pigeons is equal to the number of birds minus the number of doves:  11 - 4 = 7 pigeons. Thus, there are more pigeons than doves on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are initially 3 ptiс on the fence and then 2 more birds join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds on the fence. Now, it says that 6 storks also joined the birds on the fence. Therefore, the total number of animals (birds + storks) sitting on the fence is 5 + 6 = 11. Since there are more storks than birds on the fence, the correct answer is:  11 - 5 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 5 storks (aisty) and 3 birds (ptitsy) sitting on the fence initially. Then, 4 more birds join them. So, in total, we have:  5 + 3 = 8 storks And:  4 + 3 = 7 birds Now, let's compare the number of birds to the number of storks: 7 birds - 8 storks =? The difference between the two numbers is: 7 - 8 = -1 There are one fewer bird than stork on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is: -1
Response:  We know that there are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 3 more birds join them. So, in total, we have:  6 + 2 + 3 = 11 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many storks and birds are sitting on the fence: Storks: 6 Birds: 2 + 3 = 5 Since there are 5 birds for every 6 storks, there are more birds than storks sitting on the fence. The correct answer is B) More birds than storks.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 pigeons and 6 storks sitting on the fence. So, if we add these numbers together, we get:  3 + 6 = 9 birds in total. Now, let's look at the information given in the problem: ""2 more pigeons and 6 more storks joined them."" This means that the number of pigeons increased by 2 (since there were already 3), so now there are:  3 + 2 = 5 pigeons. And the number of storks increased by 6, so now there are:  6 + 6 = 12 storks. In total, then, there are:  5 + 12 = 17 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 17 - 9 = 8 more storks than pigeons sitting on the fence."
Response:  First chapter has 48 pages and second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many times longer first chapter is than second chapter, we need to divide number of pages in first chapter by number of pages in second chapter.  48 / 11 = 4 So, first chapter is 4 times longer than second chapter.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter.  80 - 37 = 43 So, the second chapter is 43 pages longer than the first chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in total and the first chapter has 60 pages. Therefore, the number of pages left for the second chapter is:  93 - 60 = 33 pages. So, the second chapter consists of 33 pages.
Response:  We know that the second chapter consists of 36 pages and the total number of pages in the book is 67. So we can find out how many pages are in the first chapter by subtracting the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages:  67 - 36 = 31 pages. Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages, and the third chapter has 24 pages. To find out how many pages there are in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, we have:  66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.  Therefore, there are 125 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 91 pages and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter.  91 - 23 =?  The difference is 68 pages. So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter has x pages (where x is the number of pages in the third chapter), and the third chapter has 3 pages.  To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:  2x - 3 =?  Can you solve for x?
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pages are in each chapter:  1st Chapter = 53 pages  2nd Chapter = 75 pages  3rd Chapter = 21 pages Now, let's subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the total number of pages in the first two chapters: Total Pages in 1st and 2nd Chapters = 53 + 75 = 128 pages Subtracting 21 pages (the number of pages in the third chapter) gives us: Remaining Pages in 1st and 2nd Chapters = 128 - 21 = 107 pages So, the first chapter is longer than the third chapter by: 107 pages - 21 pages = 86 pages Therefore, the first chapter is 86 pages longer than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total. So we can calculate the number of pages as follows:   Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter  Number of pages = 31 x 61  Number of pages = 1931  Therefore, there are 1931 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that the first chapter consists of 10 pages and the entire book has 23 pages in total. So we can calculate how many pages are in the first chapter as follows:   First chapter = Total number of pages x Percentage of pages in the first chapter  First chapter = 23 x 1/10  First chapter = 2.3 pages  Therefore, there are approximately 2.3 pages in the first chapter.
Response:  We know that the second chapter consists of 68 pages. If the book has two chapters, and the first chapter contains 81 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is:  81 + 68 = 149 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 68 pages.
Response:  We know that in total, 62 + 39 = 101 laagerknik went to the dam. Now we need to find out how many more people went in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, subtract the number of people who went in the afternoon from the total number of people:  101 - 39 = 62. So there were 62 more people who went in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that 52 laagerikns went to the dam in the morning and 61 laagerikns went to the dam during the day. Next, we need to find out how many more people went to the dam during the day than in the morning. To do this, subtract the number of people who went to the dam in the morning from the total number of people who went to the dam during the day.  52 + 61 = 113 So, there were 113 people who went to the dam during the day. Now, let's subtract the number of people who went to the dam in the morning from the total number of people who went to the dam during the day: 113 - 52 = 61 Therefore, 61 more people went to the dam during the day than in the morning.
Response:  We know that in total, 32 people went to the dam.  If 15 people went in the morning, then how many more people can go after lunch?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of people who went in the morning from 32.  32 - 15 = 17  So, 17 people went to the dam after lunch.
Response:  We know that in total, 60 people went to the beach that day.  Of those, 7 people went in the morning and x people went in the afternoon (where x is the number of people who went in the afternoon).  So we can set up an equation based on this information:  7 + x = 60  Now solve for x.  In other words, add 7 and 60. 7 + 60 = 67  Therefore, there were 67 people who went to the beach in the afternoon.  To find out how many people went in the morning, subtract the number of people who went in the afternoon from the total number of people who went to the beach that day:  60 - 67 = 3  There were 3 people who went to the beach in the morning.
"Response:  We know that in total, 36 + 13 + 49 = 98 people went to the dam.  
So, if we add all three numbers together, we get:  
36 + 13 + 49 = 98  Therefore, there were 98 people who went to the dam."
Response:  We know that in total, 44 + 39 + 31 = 124 laagerknicks went for a swim. Now we need to find out how many more people went for a swim in the morning than during the day. To do this, let's subtract the number of people who went for a swim during the day from the total number of people who went for a swim:  124 - 39 = 85. So there were 85 more people who went for a swim in the morning than during the day.
Response:  We know that in total, 53 + 48 + 49 = 150 people went swimming. Now we need to find out how many more people went swimming in the morning than in the evening. To do this, let's subtract the number of people who went swimming in the evening from the total number of people who went swimming:  150 - 49 = 101. So there were 101 more people who went swimming in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that in total, 33 + 34 + 10 = 77 laagerinik went to the dam.  Now we need to find out how many more people went during the day than at night. To do this, subtract the number of people who went at night from the total number of people who went:  77 - 10 = 67. So, there were 67 more people who went during the day than at night.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 13 laagerers went to the dam in the morning and 59 laagers went on a hike in the morning. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  13 + 59 = 72  Now, we are told that 21 laagers went to the dam after lunch. So, if we add this number to our previous total, we get:  72 + 21 = 93  Therefore, there were 93 laagers who went to the dam.
Response:  We know that 29 laagerknigs went to the dam in the morning and 66 laagerknigs went on a hike in the morning. So, together they are 29 + 66 = 95 people who went either to the dam or on a hike in the morning.   Now we know that 26 laagerknigs went to the dam after lunch. So, if we subtract the number of people who went to the dam in the morning from the total number of people who went to the dam (morning plus afternoon), we get:   Total number of people who went to the dam = 29 + 26 = 55 people.  Therefore, more people went to the dam in the morning than after lunch because 55 - 26 = 30 people more went to the dam in the morning than after lunch.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 4 laagerers went on a hike in the morning and 26 laagers went on a hike after lunch. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  4 + 26 = 30  Therefore, there were 30 laagers who went on either a hike or a grebel. Next, we are told that 4 laagers went on a hike in the morning, so if we subtract this number from the total number of laagers who went on either a hike or a grebel, we get:  30 - 4 = 26  Finally, we can see that 26 laagers went on a grebel. Therefore, the total number of laagers who went on either a hike or a grebel is 26, and the total number of laagers who went on a grebel is also 26.
Response:  We know that in total, 46 people went to the dam. Of these, 43 people went in the morning and some more people went during the day. So we can start by finding out how many people went during the day. To do this, we subtract the number of people who went in the morning from the total number of people who went to the dam:  46 - 43 =?  Now we have our answer! There were 3 people who went to the dam during the day.
Response:  If Rachel collected 4 apples from the tree, then there are 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 apples on the tree and now there are 2 left. So, Raechel must have picked up  4 - 2 = 2 apples.
Response:  Rachel collected 7 ripe apples from the tree, so there were 7 - 7 = 0 ripe apples left on the tree. Now, if 3 of the remaining apples are ripe and 5 are not ripe, we can calculate the number of unripe apples as follows: Number of unripe apples = Total number of apples - Number of ripe apples Number of unripe apples = 5 - 3 Number of unripe apples = 2 So, there are 2 unripe apples left on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 apples from the tree and there are now 7 apples left on the tree. If 6 of them are ripe, then there were initially 2 more than 6 = 8 apples on the tree. So, there were 8 - 2 = 6 speckled apples on the tree initially.
Response:  Rachel collected 6 ripe apples from the tree, so there were initially more than 6 apples on the tree.  2 ripe apples remained on the tree after Rachel collected 6, so there were 2 + 6 = 8 apples on the tree in total. Since 4 of them were not yet ripe, there must have been 8 - 4 = 4 immature apples on the tree initially. Therefore, there were 4 + 2 = 6 apples on the tree initially.
Response:  We know that Rachel collected 3 spe...
Response:  Rachel collected 7 apples from the tree, so there were initially 7 + 2 = 9 apples on the tree. Now there are 6 apples left on the tree, so we can subtract 6 from 9 to find out how many apples were initially on the tree:  9 - 6 = 3. Therefore, there were 3 apples on the tree initially.
Response:  First, Raechel picked 4 apples from the tree, so there were 2 - 4 = 0 apples left on the tree. Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 3 + 0 = 3 apples on the tree. Therefore, there are currently 3 apples on the tree.
Response:  Rachel had 52 apples in total. She picked 2 apples from one of her trees, so she has 52 - 2 = 50 apples left. Since there are 7 apples left on the tree, we can conclude that there were 7 + 50 = 57 apples on the tree initially.
Response:  Rachel collected 8 apples from each tree, so she collected a total of 8 x 3 = 24 apples. Since there are now only 9 apples left on all three trees, there must have been 24 + 9 = 33 apples initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has four apple trees and she collected 7 apples from each tree. So, in total, she collected 4 x 7 = 28 apples. Now, there are only 29 apples left on the trees, so we can subtract 28 from 29 to find out how many apples Rachel collected altogether:  29 - 28 = 1. Therefore, Rachel collected 1 apple.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug before some of his marbles were lost. So if Ed had x marbles, then Doug had x - 2 marbles. Now we are told that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug after some of Doug's marbles were lost. This can be represented as follows:  
Ed = x + 19  
Doug = x - 2  To find out how many marbles Doug lost, we need to solve for x in terms of Doug's number of marbles. Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  
x - 2 = Doug  
Substituting x + 19 for Ed gives us:  
x + 19 - 2 = Doug  
Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  
x = 17  
So Doug lost 17 marbles."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 45 mra...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 22 mra...
Response:  We know that Ed had 27 mra...
Response:  First, we know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug had x marbles, Ed had x + 24 marbles.   Next, we know that Doug lost 27 marbles on the game board. So after losing those marbles, Doug has x - 27 marbles left.  Now, let's find out how many marbles Ed had after finding the extra 9 marbles. We can do this by adding the number of marbles Doug lost to the number of marbles Ed already had:  Ed had x + 24 marbles before and found 9 more, so he now has:  x + 24 + 9 =?  Finally, we need to compare the number of marbles Ed had with the number of marbles Doug had after losing 27 marbles. To do this, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug had after losing 27 marbles from the total number of marbles Ed had:  x + 24 + 9 - (x - 27) =?  Simplifying and solving for the unknown variable x, we get:  x + 24 + 9 - (x - 27) = x + 24 + 9 - x + 0 = 25 + 9 = 34 marbles.  Therefore, Ed had 34 marbles more than Doug after both players finished their games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. This means that if Doug had x marbles, then Ed had x + 29 marbles. Secondly, we know that Ed lost 17 marbles on the game field. So, after losing those marbles, Ed has (x + 29) - 17 =? Thirdly, we need to find out how many marbles Doug has now. We can do this by subtracting the number of marbles Ed lost from the total number of marbles Ed had: (x + 29) - 17 =? Finally, we compare the remaining marbles of both players to determine which one has more marbles. To do this, we subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has:? - x =? Solution: Let's substitute the values we know into the equation: (x + 29) - 17 =? Since Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, we can write: (x + 29) - 17 = (x + 29) - (x + 12) = 17 The first equation simplifies to: x + 29 - 17 = 17 Solving for x gives us: x = 8 Now we have found the number of marbles Doug had before Ed lost his marbles: Doug had 8 marbles. Next, we calculate the number of marbles Ed had before he lost any: Ed had 8 + 29 = 37 marbles. Now we can calculate the number of marbles each player has left: Doug has 8 - 17 = -9 marbles (since he lost 17 marbles) Ed has 37 - 17 = 20 marbles Therefore, Ed has more marbles than Doug. The correct answer is: There are 20 marbles left for Ed and -9 marbles left for Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug before he lost some of them. So if we let D be the number of marbles Doug had, then Ed had D + 19. Now we are told that after losing some marbles, Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug. This can be represented as: 
D + (D + 19) = 8 + D  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2D + 19 = 8  Subtracting 19 from both sides gives us:  2D = -11  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  D = -5  Therefore, Doug had 5 marbles before Ed lost any.  To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the total number of marbles Ed had:  Ed had D + 19 = 5 + 19 = 24 marbles Before losing any marbles, Ed had 24 - 5 = 19 more marbles than Doug. Since Ed currently has 8 more marbles than Doug, Ed must have lost 19 - 8 = 11 marbles."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 91 marbles and lost 21 of them. So, he has 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left. Now, let's compare this number with Doug's marbles. We don't know exactly how many marbles Doug had, but we do know that Ed had more than him. Therefore, if Ed had 70 marbles after losing 21, then Doug must have had fewer than 70 marbles before he lost any. Let's assume that Doug had x marbles before losing any (x < 70). After losing some marbles, Doug would have had x - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles he lost. Since Doug didn't lose as many marbles as Ed did, his loss must be less than or equal to 21. This means that x - y <= 21. Simplifying the inequality, we get: x - y <= 21. Solving for x, we get: x >= 48 + y. Since y is an unknown quantity, we can't determine x precisely. However, we can say that x was greater than 48 because Doug had fewer marbles than Ed before losing any. In other words, there were more than 48 marbles difference between Ed and Doug when they started playing.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed had x mrabroms, then Doug had x - 12 mmarbles.  Secondly, we know that Ed lost 20 marbles on the game playground. Therefore, Ed has now x - 20 mmarbles.  Now, let's find out how many marbles Doug has. We can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  
Ed has x - 20 marbles = 17 marbles  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x - 20 = 17  Solving for x, we get:  x = 37  Therefore, Doug has 37 - 12 = 25 marbles."
"Response:  We know that in total, 408 students made suggestions for the menu and 42 suggested adding bacon. To find out how many more students suggested carrot puree than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who made suggestions.  
So, if we subtract 42 from 408, we get:  
408 - 42 = 366  
Therefore, there are 366 students who suggested carrot puree more than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are in total 479 + 489 = 968 students who made suggestions.  
Now we need to find out how many more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested adding mashed potatoes. To do this, subtract the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes from the total number of students:  
968 - 479 =?  The difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of students who suggested adding bacon:  
968 - 479 = 489  So, 489 students suggested adding bacon, while 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes."
Response:  We know that there were 310 students in total who made suggestions for the menu. Of those, 185 suggested adding carrot puree, and the remaining 125 (310 - 185) suggested adding bacon. So, 125 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
Response:  We know that there were 288 students in total who made suggestions for the menu. Of those, 264 suggested adding bacon. That means there were 288 - 264 = 24 students who did not suggest adding bacon. Since we are told that some of the students suggested adding carrot puree to the menu, let's subtract the number of students who suggested adding bacon from the total number of students to find out how many students suggested adding carrot puree.  24 (students who did not suggest adding bacon) + 288 (total number of students) = 312. Therefore, there were 312 students in total who suggested adding carrot puree to the menu.
"Response:  We know that 457 students made suggestions for the menu and 63 of them suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students suggested adding bacon, we can subtract the number of students who suggested adding carrot puree from the total number of students who made suggestions.  
So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is:  
457 - 414 = 43  Therefore, there were 43 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  We know that there were 182 students who made suggestions for the menu, and of those, 166 suggested adding bacon. To find out how many students suggested adding bacon, we can subtract the number of students who suggested adding carrot puree (182 - 14 = 168) from the total number of students (182). Therefore, 168 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
"Response:  We know that in total, 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in suggesting new food items for the menu. So, to find out how many students took part in proposing each specific item, we need to divide the number of students who suggested each item by the total number of participants:  

324/826 = 0.395 (approximately 39.5%) proposed carrot puree.  
374/826 = 0.455 (approximately 45.5%) proposed bacon.  
128/826 = 0.154 (approximately 15.4%) proposed tomatoes. Therefore, approximately 39.5% of the students proposed adding carrot puree, 45.5% proposed adding bacon, and 15.4% proposed adding tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that 257 students requested carrot puree, and 120 students requested bacon in the menu. To find out how many more students requested carrot puree than bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who requested bacon from the number of students who requested carrot puree.  
So, if we subtract 120 from 257, we get:  
257 - 120 = 137  
Therefore, there are 137 more students who requested carrot puree than bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are 144 students who want to add carrot puree to the menu, and 79 students who want to add tomatoes. So we can start by subtracting the number of students who want to add tomatoes from the total number of students:  
144 + 79 = 223 - 79 = 144  Therefore, there are 144 students who want to add carrot puree to the menu more than those who want to add tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are 23 students who proposed adding tomatoes to the menu and 337 students who proposed adding bacon. To find out how many more students proposed adding bacon than those who proposed adding tomatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed adding tomatoes from the number of students who proposed adding bacon.  
So, if we subtract 23 from 337, we get: 
337 - 23 =? 
Answer: 314. Therefore, there were 314 more students who proposed adding bacon than those who proposed adding tomatoes."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 450 students who proposed adding carrot puree to the menu, and 38 students who proposed adding bacon. Therefore, the total number of students who participated in proposing new dishes is:  
450 + 38 = 488.  So, 488 students participated in proposing new dishes."
Response:  We know that in total, 218 + 351 = 569 students made suggestions for the menu. Of these, 218 suggested adding carrot puree with bacon, and 351 suggested adding only bacon to the menu. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding bacon to the menu is:  351.
"Response:  We know that 330 students wanted to add carrot puree to the menu and 269 students wanted to add bacon. To find out how many more students wanted carrot puree than bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who wanted bacon from the number of students who wanted carrot puree.  
So, if we subtract 269 from 330, we get:  
330 - 269 = 61  
Therefore, there were 61 more students who wanted carrot puree than bacon."
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in school. To find out how many more girls than boys, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls.  569 - 236 =?  The difference between the number of girls and boys is 333 (569 - 236). So, there are 333 more girls than boys in school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in school and we want to find out how many more boys than girls are in school.   First, let's add up all the students: 34 + 841 = 875. Now, we can see that there are 875 students in total. Next, we need to compare the number of boys to the number of girls. To do this, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: 875 - 34 = 841. So, there are 841 boys in school. Therefore, there are 841 - 34 = 807 more boys than girls in school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, we can start by subtracting the number of girls from the total to find out how many boys there are:  485 - 232 =?  Can you solve for the remaining number of boys?
Response:  We know that there are 697 students in total and 228 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract 228 from 697, we get the number of boys.  697 - 228 =?  The correct answer is 469.  There are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and 510 more boys than girls. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total, we get the number of boys:  635 - 425 = 210.  Therefore, there are 210 boys in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 868 students in total. Secondly, we know that there are 281 more girls than boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we will get the number of girls.  868 - (number of boys) = 281 + (number of boys) Number of boys = 868 - 281 Boys = 587 Therefore, there are 587 boys and 281 more girls, which means there are a total of 868 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in school and 142 more boys than girls. So we can start with the number of girls:  700 Now let's find out how many boys there are:  If there are 142 more boys than girls, it means that the total number of boys is 142 + 700 =...?  Can you solve for x (the number of boys)?
Response:  First, we know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in school already.  Next, we know that 418 more girls have arrived at school.  So, to find out how many students are now in school, we need to add the number of girls who were already there to the number of new girls who have arrived.  706 + 418 =?  That gives us a total of... 924 girls!  And since we also know that there are 222 boys in school, the total number of students in school now is:  924 (girls) + 222 (boys) = 1146 students.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls in school already, and we have been given that 44 more girls came to school. So, if we add 44 to 902, we get:  902 + 44 =?  The answer is 946.  Therefore, there are now 946 girls in school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in school already.  Next, we know that 465 more girls came to school.   So, let's add the number of girls who came to school to the original number of girls:  632 + 465 =?  Now, let's find out how many boys are in school:  410.  Now, compare the total number of girls with the total number of boys:  632 + 465 > 410  Yes, there are more girls than boys in school!  The difference between the two numbers is:  632 + 465 - 410 = 1272 - 410 = 862.
Response:  First, we know that there are 732 girls already in school.  If 682 more girls come to school, then the total number of girls will be:  732 + 682 = 1414 girls.  So, there are now 1414 girls in school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in school initially.  Next, we know that 496 more girls join the school, so the total number of girls is now:  135 + 496 = 631 girls.  Now, let's find out how many boys joined the school. We know that 910 more students joined the school, but we don't know if they are all boys or not. So, let's divide them into two groups - boys and girls. If we assume that half of them (i.e., 455) are boys, then the total number of boys would be:  214 + 455 = 669 boys.  Therefore, the total number of boys in the school now is 669, and the total number of girls is 631.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school, so the total number of students is:  308 + 318 = 626 students.  Now we know that there are 36 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is:  626 (students) + 36 (teachers) = 662 people.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students are in the school. We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys, so together they make up  315 + 309 = 624 students. Next, we need to add the number of teachers to get the total number of people in the school. There are 772 teachers, so if we add them to the number of students, we get  624 + 772 = 1396 people in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 402 more girls than boys in school. So if we let X be the number of boys, then the number of girls is X + 402.  Since there are a total of 739 students in the school, we can set up the equation:  
X + (X + 402) = 739  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2X + 402 = 739  Subtracting 402 from both sides gives us:  
2X = 337  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
X = 168  Therefore, there are 168 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in the school, and we have been given two pieces of information:  1) There are 458 more girls than boys. 2) There are 692 girls in total. To find out how many boys there are, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students: Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys Total students = 692 + (692 - 458) Total students = 692 + 234 Total students = 826 So, there are 826 students in the school.
Response:  First, we know that there are 362 boys in school and 257 girls.  So, if we add 403 more girls to this number, how many girls will be in total?  362 + 403 = 765 girls. Now, let's find out how many boys will be in total. We know that there are 257 girls already in school, so if we add 403 more girls, it means there were 257 + 403 = 660 girls in total. Since there are 765 girls in total, and 660 of them are girls who were already in school, that means there are 765 - 660 = 105 more girls in school than boys. Therefore, there are 105 more girls in school than boys.
Response:  First, we know that Edward had $18. Then he spent $16. So how much does he have left?  18 - 16 =?  18 - 16 = 2.  Therefore, Edward has $2 left.
"Response:  We know that Edward had $13 and now he has $3 left. So, we can start with the equation:  
$13 - $3 =?  Now, let's solve for the missing amount:  
$10 =?  There you have it! The answer is $10."
Response:  First, Edward spent $9, so he had $17 - $9 = $8 left.   Therefore, before spending any money, Edward had $8.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $16 on books and each book cost the same amount of money. So, he bought 16/9 = 17 books (since there are 92 books in total). Now, let's calculate how much money Edward had before he spent any money. We can do this by subtracting the amount he spent from the total amount of money he had:  92 x $1 = $92 Before spending money, Edward had $92 - $16 = $76. Therefore, Edward had $76 before he spent his money.
Response:  Edward spent $6 on two books, so each book cost $6/2 = $3.   Therefore, each book cost $3.
Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $6 + $16 = $22 dollars in total. So he had $19 - $22 = -$3 left after spending his money. But this can't be right, since we know he has $19 dollars left! Therefore, we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our calculations again and make sure everything is correct.
"Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so he spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7. Now, we are told that he has $12 left, so we can subtract $7 from $12 to find out how much he spent on each item:  
$12 - $7 = $5  
So, Edward spent $5 on books and $2 on pens."
"Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens, so he spent a total of $16 + $8 = $24. We also know that he has $19 left, so we can set up an equation:  
$24 - $19 =?  Solution:  To find out how much more Edward spent on books than on pens, we need to subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he spent:  
$24 - $8 = $16  So, Edward spent $16 more on books than on pens."
"Response:  First, we know that Edward spent $17. Then he received $10 from his friend. So, let's subtract the amount he received ($10) from what he spent ($17):  
$17 - $10 =?  Answer: $7"
Response:  We know that David made 58 more than Zachary. So if we let Z be the number of push-ups Zachary did, then David did Z + 58.   Now, we are told that together they did 44 push-ups. So we can set up the equation:  Z + (Z + 58) = 44  Simplifying this equation, we get:  2Z + 58 = 44  Solving for Z, we get:  Z = 20  Therefore, Zachary did 20 push-ups and David did 20 + 58 = 78 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Захари made 51 push-ups and Dаvid made 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Захари did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Захари did. So, if we subtract 44 (the number of push-ups David did) from 51 (the number of push-ups Захари did), we get:  51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Захари did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 push-ups during class today.  If David made 9 more push-ups than Zachary, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.   Let D be the number of push-ups Zachary made.  Then we can write:  D + 9 = 44... (1) Now we need to solve for D. To do this, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: D + 9 - 9 = 44 - 9 D = 35 So Zachary made 35 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that David made 51 push-ups and Zakari made fewer than David. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let D be the number of push-ups Zakari made. Then we can write: 
D + 49 = 51 (since David made 51 push-ups)  Now solve for D: 
D = 51 - 49  D = 2  Therefore, Zakari made 2 push-ups, and together they did 51 + 2 = 53 push-ups."
Response:  We know that David made 19 more push-ups than Zachary and 27 fewer curls. So we can start with what Zachary did:  59 push-ups + 44 curls =?  Now let's add the information about David:  59 + (19 - 27) =?  Can you solve for the missing numbers?
"Response:  We know that David made more than 29 push-ups but fewer than 13 scruples than Zachary. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let D be the number of scruples done by David. Then we can write:  
D = 29 + (13 - x)...(1) where x is the number of push-ups done by David. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:  
D = 29 + (13 - 29) = 29 + (-16) = 13  
Therefore, David did 13 scruples."
Response:  We know that David made 17 more push-ups than Zachary, but 10 fewer scruples than Zachary. So we can start with what Zachary did:   Zachary made 53 push-ups and 14 scruples. Now let's find out how many push-ups David did:   David made 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did:   Push-ups = 53 + 17 = 70 push-ups  And now let's find out how many scruples David did:   David made 10 fewer scruples than Zachary, so he did:   Scruples = 14 - 10 = 4 scruples  Therefore, Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 scruples, and David did 70 push-ups and 4 scruples.
"Response:  We know that David made more than 35 (Zakhar) push-ups but less than 87 (Zakhar) scruples. So we can write an inequality:  

David did more push-ups than Zakhar:  

35 + x > 35  where x is the number of push-ups done by David. 

We also know that David did fewer scruples than Zakhar:  

x < 87, where x is the number of scruples done by David. 

Now we have two inequalities:  

35 + x > 35 and x < 87.  Can you solve this system of equations to find out how many push-ups and scruples each boy did?"
Response:  We know that David made more than 38 odжиманий and less than 62 skruchivaniy. So we can write an inequality:  38 < David's number of skruchivaniya < 62. Now let's look at Zahar's data. He did 46 push-ups and 58 twists. We need to find out how many more skruchivaniy he did than push-ups. To do this, subtract the number of push-ups from the number of skruchivaniy:  58 - 46 = 12. So Zahar did 12 more skruchivaniy than push-ups. Since David did more than 38 skruchivaniy, we know that Zahar did more than 12 skruchivaniy. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Zahar did 12 + x skruchivaniy, where x is the number of skruchivaniy that David did. We know that David did more than 38 skruchivaniy, so x > 38. Substituting x into the equation above, we get:  12 + x > 38. Solving for x, we get:  x = 49. Therefore, Zahar did 49 skruchivaniy, which is 17 more than his number of push-ups.
"Response:  We know that David made more than Zachary and less than John. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
David = Zachary + (John - Zachary)  Since we are told that David made 39 more than Zachary, we can write: 
David = Zachary + 39  Now we need to find out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that John did 13 fewer push-ups than David, so we can write: 
John = David - 13  Substituting this into our first equation, we get: 
Zachary = David - 13 + 39  Solving for Zachary, we get: 
Zachary = 26  Therefore, Zachary did 26 push-ups. And since David did 39 more than Zachary, David did: 
David = Zachary + 39 = 26 + 39 = 65 push-ups."
Response:  We know that David made more than 22 push-ups because John did fewer push-ups than David. So, we can start with the fact that David made 23 push-ups (since he made more than 22). Now, let's look at how many push-ups John made:  Since John did fewer push-ups than David, John made fewer push-ups than 23. Therefore, John made 22 push-ups. Finally, let's find out how many push-ups Zachary made:  If David made 23 push-ups and John made 22 push-ups, then Zachary must have made 51 - (23 + 22) = 51 - 45 = 6 push-ups.  So, the correct answer is 6.
"Response:  We know that David made 39 more than Zachary, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Zachary = D - 39... (1) where ""D"" is the number of push-ups David did. Now, we also know that John did 9 fewer than David, so we can set up another equation:  
John = D - 9... (2) Since we want to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we need to subtract John's score from Zachary's score:  
Zachary - John = D - 39 - (D - 9) = D - 39 - D + 9 = 20... (3) Simplifying the expression, we get:  
Zachary - John = 20 Solving for the difference between Zachary and John, we get:  
Zachary did 20 more push-ups than John."
"Response:  We know that David made 37 push-ups and Zakary made x push-ups (where x is an unknown number).  Since David made 30 more push-ups than Zakary, we can set up the equation:  

David - Zakary = 30 

We also know that David made 37 push-ups, so we can add this to the previous equation:  

37 - Zakary = 30 

Now solve for Zakary:  

Zakary = 37 - 30 

Zakary = 7 

Therefore, Zakary made 7 push-ups."
Response:  We know that David made 38 push-ups and Zachary made fewer than 38 push-ups. So if we add up the number of push-ups they both did together, it would be equal to 38 + (fewer than 38) = 38 + x, where x is the number of push-ups Zachary made. Since David made more than Zachary, we can say that x < 38. Therefore, the total number of push-ups done by both David and Zachary together is:  38 + x = 38 + (less than 38) = 38 + 20 = 58.
Response:  We know that David did more push-ups than Zachary, but fewer scruples. So if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, then David must have done more push-ups than that. Specifically, he did 40 more push-ups than Zachary, since he did 40 - 34 = 6 more push-ups. However, we also know that David did fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did 17 fewer crunches than Zachary. Therefore, David did  62 - 17 = 45 crunches.  Thus, David did 6 more push-ups and 45 crunches.
"Response:  We know that David made 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer scruples. So we can start with these numbers to find out how many push-ups and crunches each of them did.  
Let's say Zachary did x push-ups and y crunches. Since he did 58 push-ups in total, we can write an equation for this information:  
x + 33 = 58... (1) Now let's look at what we know about David:  
David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did:  
x + 36 =?... (2) And David did 33 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did:  
y - 33 =?... (3) Now we need to solve equations (1), (2), and (3) simultaneously to find out how many push-ups and crunches each of them did. To do this, we will use substitution or elimination methods. Let's choose the substitution method. Solving equation (1) first, we get:  
x + 33 = 58... (4) Substituting equation (4) into equation (2), we get:  
(x + 33) + 36 =?... (5) Simplifying equation (5), we get:  
2x + 69 =?... (6) Solving equation (6), we get:  
2x = 63... (7) Now substituting equation (7) back into equation (4), we get:  
x = 31... (8) Finally, solving equation (3), we get:  
y = 31 + 33 = 64... (9) Therefore, Zachary did 31 push-ups and 64 crunches, while David did 31 + 36 = 67 push-ups and 64 - 33 = 31 crunches."
Response:  First, we know that David made more push-ups than Zachary (27 vs 5). Second, we know that Zachary did more crunches than David (17 vs 7). So if we subtract the number of crunches David did from the total number of crunches, we can find out how many more crunches Zachary did than push-ups.  17 - 7 = 10  Therefore, Zachary did 10 more crunches than push-ups.
Response:  If Rachel had to do 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading, we can start by writing down what we know:  5 + 2 = 7 pages in total.  So, there were 7 pages in total.  Now, let's check which part took up more space:  Math or Reading?  To do this, we need to compare the number of pages for each subject.  We know that Rachel did 5 pages of math homework, so if she did 2 pages of reading, then:  5 > 2 (since 5 is greater than 2) Therefore, the math homework took up more space than the reading.  In other words, Rachel had more math homework than reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading. So we can start by writing down what we know:  3 + 4 = 7  Now we need to find out how many more pages of reading Rachel did compared to math homework. To do this, we subtract the number of pages of math homework from the total number of pages of reading:  4 - 3 = 1  Therefore, Rachel did one more page of reading than math homework.
"Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework and several pages of reading, we can assume that she completed all 7 pages of homework (5 pages of math + several pages of reading). Therefore, if she had to do 7 pages of reading, then she must have done 2 pages of reading (7 - 5 = 2).  
So, Rachel did 2 pages of reading."
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework and she did 4 more pages of math than reading, then we can set up an equation based on this information.  
Let M represent the number of pages of math homework and R represent the number of pages of reading. We know that M + 4 = 7 (because she did 4 more pages of math than reading). Now solve for R: R = 7 - M - 4 R = 7 - M - 4 To find out how many pages of reading Rachel had to do, we need to substitute M with its value. For example, if M = 3, then R = 7 - 3 - 4 R = 7 - 3 - 4 R = 1 So Rachel had to read 1 page.  Therefore, the answer is 1 page."
Response:  First, we know that Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of math homework. Second, we know that she has to do 3 more pages of math than reading. So, if we let X be the number of pages of reading, then Rachel will have to do 3 + X pages of math. Finally, we can set up the equation:  8 = X + (3 + X) Since Rachel has to do 3 more pages of math than reading, we can write:  8 = 2X + 3 Therefore, solving for X, we get:  X = 4 So, Rachel needs to read 4 pages and do 7 pages of math (3 + 4). In total, she needs to complete 11 pages.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of math homework and she has to do 6 more pages of reading comprehension than math, then we can set up an equation as follows:  8 + 6 =? (number of pages of reading comprehension) We know that Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of math homework, so we can start with that number: 8 Now, we need to add 6 more pages for reading comprehension: 8 + 6 = 14 So, Rachel needs to complete 14 pages of homework in total. Therefore, she needs to complete 6 more pages of reading comprehension than math.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel needs to do 10 pages of math homework.  Second, we know that she has to read 3 more pages than she does math. So if she does x pages of math, then she will have to read x + 3 pages.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  10 = x + 3  To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:  7 = x  Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 7 pages of math homework in total (3 pages of reading and 4 pages of math).
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math homework, so we can add 2 pages to her total number of pages. Next, she had to read 3 pages, so we can add another 3 pages to her total. Finally, she had to do 10 pages of biology homework, so we can add 10 more pages to her total. Therefore, Rachel needed to complete a total of:  2 + 3 + 10 = 15 pages.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel has to do 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading. So, if we subtract 2 from 9, we get 7. Therefore, Rachel has 7 more pages of math homework than reading.   Can you explain your reasoning in more detail?
Response:  First, we know that Rachel has to do 11 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework. So, if we subtract the number of pages of biology homework from the total number of pages of math homework, we can find out how many pages of math homework she has left.  11 - 3 =?  Yes, that's right! Rachel has 8 more pages of math homework than biology homework.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework, so let's call that x. We also know she had to do 11 pages of reading, so let's call that y. Finally, we know she had to do 8 pages of biology homework, so let's call that z. Since there are 3 types of homework, we can write an equation: x + y + z = 26 (since there are 26 pages in total). Now, we can substitute the values we know into the equation: x + y + z = 26 x + y + 8 = 26 Solving for y, we get: y = 18 So, Rachel had 18 more pages of reading than she did of biology.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of math problems and 11 pages of reading. So far, so good! Now, let's look at the total number of pages she needs to do: Total = 9 + 11 = 20 pages. Next, we are given that she also needs to do 29 pages of biology problems. Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel needs to complete is: Total = 20 + 29 = 49 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of mathematics problems. Secondly, she had to read 7 pages of text. Finally, she had to do 3 pages of biology assignments. To find out how many pages of math and biology Rachel needed to complete, let's add up the number of pages for each subject: Math + Biology = Total Number of Pages 8 + 3 = 11 So, Rachel needed to complete 11 pages in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to do 5 pages of math problems, so let's subtract that from the total number of pages she needs to complete:  5 - 5 = 0 Now, we know that she has to do 10 pages of reading and 6 pages of biology problems, so let's add those together:  0 + 10 + 6 = 16 Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 16 pages in total.
Response:  If Rachel had to do 2 pages of reading and 4 pages of math homework, we can start by comparing the number of pages of each task.  2 pages of reading + 4 pages of math homework = 6 pages in total. So, Rachel had twice as much math homework as she did reading (2 x 2 = 4). Therefore, Rachel had 4 more pages of math homework than reading.
Response:  First, we know that Rachel had to do 4 pages of reading and 7 pages of math homework. So, if we subtract the number of pages of reading from the total number of pages of math homework, we get:  7 - 4 = 3  Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than she did of reading.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic mails in the morning and 2 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 2 (the number of emails he received in the evening) from 6 (the number of emails he received in the morning), we get:  
6 - 2 = 4  Therefore, Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the evening."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic mails in the morning and 8 in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the evening than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of morning emails from the number of evening emails.  6 (morning) - 8 (evening) =?  So, Jack received 2 fewer emails in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received 4 electronic mails in the morning and several more in the afternoon, we can assume that he received x electronic mails in the afternoon.  Since he received a total of 5 emails for the day, we know that the sum of the number of electronic mails he received in the morning and those he received in the afternoon is equal to 5.   Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  4 + x = 5  To solve this equation, we can subtract 4 from both sides:  4 + x - 4 = 5 - 4  This simplifies to:  x = 1  So, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic mails in the morning, 3 emails during the day, and 5 emails in the evening. To find out how many emails Jack received in one day, we need to add up all these numbers:  6 + 3 + 5 = 14. So, Jack received 14 emails in one day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 letters in the morning and 8 letters in the evening. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  5 + 8 = 13  Therefore, Jack received 13 letters in total.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 letters in the daytime and 8 letters in the evening. To find out how many letters he received during each time period, we can add up the numbers of letters he received at each time.   Daytime: 5 letters Evening: 8 letters Total: 13 letters So, Jack received 13 letters in total.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 electronic mails in the morning and 8 electronic letters in the evening. So we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:  
Morning: 3 + Evening: 8 = Total:?  Solution: To find out how many emails Jack received in total, we need to add the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the evening. Therefore, the solution is:  
Total = 3 + 8 = 11  So Jack received 11 electronic mails in total - 3 in the morning and 8 in the evening."
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning.  10 - 7 = 3 So, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the evening.
"Response:  First, we know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. So, the difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the evening is:  

9 - 7 = 2  Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than he did in the evening."
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning, so he received 10 - 5 = 5 emails more in the morning than in the evening.   Therefore, the number of emails Jack received more during the day is 5.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 electronic mails in the morning and 3 more during the day. So, if we add these numbers together, we get:  6 + 3 = 9 That means Jack received 9 emails during the day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received  3 electronic letters in the morning and 5 electronic letters in the evening, so the total number of electronic letters he received is:  3 + 5 = 8.  Next, we know that Jack received 64 paper letters in the morning and 54 paper letters in the evening, so the total number of paper letters he received is:  64 + 54 = 118.  Therefore, the total number of messages Jack received during the day is:  8 (electronic) + 118 (paper) = 126.
Response:  First, Jack received 5 electronic messages and 6 paper messages in the morning, so we can add these numbers together to get our total for the morning:  5 + 6 = 11. Then, Jack received 9 electronic messages and 7 paper messages in the afternoon, so we can add these numbers together to get our total for the afternoon:  9 + 7 = 16. Finally, we need to add the two totals together to find out how many messages Jack received in total for the day:  11 + 16 = 27. So, Jack received 27 messages in total for the day.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 10 electronic mails in the morning and 12 paper letters. So, he received a total of 10 + 12 = 22 pieces of mail in the morning.   Next, we know that Jack received 3 electronic mails and 44 paper letters in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 3 + 44 = 47 pieces of mail in the afternoon.  Now, let's compare the number of electronic mails Jack received in the morning to those he received in the afternoon. We can see that he received 10 electronic mails in the morning and 3 electronic mails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received more electronic mails in the morning than in the afternoon (10 > 3).  Finally, let's calculate the difference between the number of electronic mails Jack received in the morning and those he received in the afternoon. To do this, we subtract the smaller number from the larger number: 10 - 3 = 7.  So, Jack received 7 more electronic mails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 6 electronic mails and 8 paper letters in the morning. So, the total number of mail he received in the morning is:  6 + 8 = 14  In the afternoon, he received 2 electronic mails and 7 paper letters. Therefore, the total number of mail he received in the afternoon is:  2 + 7 = 9  Now, let's compare the two numbers:  14 - 9 = 5  So, Jack received 5 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  First, we know that Jack received 6 electronic mails in the morning and sent  91 emails. So, in total, he received 6 + 91 = 97 emails during the day.  In the evening, he received 2 more emails and sent 74 emails, so the total number of emails he received for the day is 97 + 2 = 99 emails.
"Response:  First, Jack sent  2 emails in the morning and received  4 emails. So, at noon, he had  4 - 2 =  2 emails left to send. Then, he received  6 more emails and sent  8 more emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack sent during the day is:  
2 + (6 - 2) =  2 +  4 =  6 emails."
Response:  We know that Jack received 7 emails in the morning and x more emails in the afternoon.  So, in total, he received 7 + x emails during the day.  Since we are told that Jack received only 9 emails in total, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  7 + x = 9  To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:   x = 9 - 7  x = 2  Therefore, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received.   Total number of emails = 5 + 3 = 8 So, there are 8 emails in total. Now, let's subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails: 8 - 3 = 5 Therefore, Jack received 5 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the second half of the day and he received a total of 10 emails for the entire day. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  3 + 6 = 10  Solving for the unknown variable (in this case, ""6""), we get:  6 = 7 Therefore, Jack received 7 emails in the morning."
Response:  First, we need to convert both distances from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:  9 inches = 0.75 feet (9 / 12)  12 inches = 1 foot (12 / 12) Now we can compare the two distances in feet:  0.75 feet < 1 foot So, the distance pried by the frog is longer than the distance jumped by the grasshopper. Specifically, the frog jumped 12 - 0.75 = 11.25 feet farther than the grasshopper.
Response:  First, we need to convert both distances from inches to feet.  1 inch = 0.083333 feet (approximately) So, 31 inches = 31 x 0.083333 = 2.6 feet  Similarly, 35 inches = 35 x 0.083333 = 2.94 feet Now, let's add the two distances together: 2.6 + 2.94 = 5.54 feet Therefore, the total distance pried by the sarancha and the frog is approximately 5.54 feet.
Response:  First, we know that the sorocopt pried on 36 dynimals. Second, we know that the lizard jumped 17 dinimals further than the sorocopt. Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 15 dinimals further than the lizard. So if we set up an equation based on this information, we can solve for the distance that the lizard jumped. Here is the equation: Lizard distance = Sorocopt distance + (Lizard distance - Mouse distance) We know that the sorocopt distance is 36 dinimals, and the mouse distance is 15 dinimals further than the lizard distance. So we can substitute these values into the equation: Lizard distance = 36 + (17 - 15) We simplify the equation: Lizard distance = 36 + 2 We solve for the lizard distance: Lizard distance = 38 dinimals Therefore, the lizard jumped 38 dinimals.
Response:  First, we know that the owl jumped 25 inches (ddu). Then, the frog jumped 18 inches (dd) farther than the owl, so the frog jumped 25 + 18 = 43 inches (dd). Finally, the mouse jumped 2 inches (d) farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 43 + 2 = 45 inches (d). Therefore, the mouse jumped 45 inches (d).
Response:  First, we know that the lizard jumped 10 d...
Response:  First, we know that the sorocopud jumped 19 inches (dduyinchs). Second, we know that the lizard jumped farther than the sorocopud by 39 inches (dduyninch). Finally, we know that the mouse jumped fewer inches than the lizard by 94 inches (dduyninch). So if we subtract the distance the sorocopod jumped from the distance the lizard jumped, we get:  39 - 19 = 20 inches.  Therefore, the lizard jumped 20 inches.
Response:  First, we know that the lizard jumped 32 d...
Response:  First, we know that the lizard jumped 33 inches farther than the crow. So if the crow jumped x inches, then the lizard jumped x + 33 inches.  Next, we know that the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the lizard. So if the lizard jumped x + 33 inches, then the mouse jumped x + 33 - 5 = x + 28 inches.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:   x + 28 = x + 33  Simplifying the equation, we get:  28 = 5  The answer is 5.  Therefore, the mouse jumped 5 inches fewer than the crow.
"Response:  First, we know that the owl jumped 13 inches (ddu). Then, we are told that the frog jumped 2 inches (dd) farther than the owl. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Frog's distance = Owl's distance + 2  
Substituting ddu for ""Owl's distance"", we get:  

Frog's distance = 13 + 2  
Simplifying, we have:  

Frog's distance = 15  
Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches (ddu)."
Response:  We know that the salamander jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper. So if the grasshopper jumped x inches, the salamander jumped x + 4 inches. The total distance they jumped together is the sum of their individual jumps: x + (x + 4) = 35 + 4 = 39 inches. Therefore, the numeric answer is 39 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we need to determine how many jumps the frog made in total. We know that the frog jumped three times as high as it was before, so if it was one meter high initially, then after the first jump, it would be three meters high (1 + 2 = 3). After the second jump, it would be nine meters high (3 + 6 = 9), and after the third jump, it would be twenty-seven meters high (9 + 18 = 27). Therefore, the frog jumped twenty-seven meters in total.
"Response:  First, we know that the owl jumped 39 inches (ddu = 39). Second, we are told that the frog jumped 19 inches less than the owl (fgg = ddu - 19), so we can write: 

fgg = ddu - 19 

Substituting ddu = 39, we get: 

fgg = 39 - 19 

Simplifying, we get: 

fgg = 10 + 9 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 10 + 9 = 19 inches."
Response:  We know that the mouse jumped 3 times its own length, and the grasshopper jumped 5 times its own length. So we need to find out how much longer the grasshopper jumped than the mouse. To do this, we can compare the distances they traveled. The mouse jumped 3 x its own length, which is 3x(2 cm) = 6 cm. The grasshopper jumped 5 x its own length, which is 5x(4 cm) = 20 cm. Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 14 cm (20 - 6) farther than the mouse.
"Response:  We know that the frog jumped farther than the cricket, but we don't know how much farther. So, let's use ""?"" to represent the unknown distance.  1. The cricket jumped? meters. (We know this from the problem statement.)  2. The frog jumped more than the cricket, so we can write an inequality: F > C (where F is the distance the frog jumped and C is the distance the cricket jumped).  3. Since the frog jumped more than the cricket, we know that F >? (the distance the cricket jumped).  4. Now we have two inequalities: F > C and F >?. Can we combine these inequalities to get a single equation with one unknown? Yes, we can! Here's the equation: F > C +?. Solve for F: F = C +?. Now we can substitute the values we know: F = 5 +? (since the cricket jumped 5 meters). Simplify: F = 5 +?. Finally, solve for F: F = 7. So, the frog jumped 7 meters farther than the cricket."
Response:  First, we know that the lizard jumped 33 inches (cm) more than the crow. So if the crow jumped x inches, then the lizard jumped x + 33 inches.   Second, we know that the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. So if the frog jumped y inches, then the mouse jumped y - 3 inches.  Now let's substitute the values we have found into the equation for the lizard's jump:  x + 33 = y  We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:  x + 33 = y - 3  Now solve for x:  x = y - 36  Since we know that the crow jumped 9 inches, we can plug that value in for y:  x = 9 - 36  x = -27  So the mouse jumped 27 inches.
Response:  We know that the mouse jumped 3 times as far as the grasshopper. So if the grasshopper jumped x meters, then the mouse jumped 3x meters. Now we are given that the mouse jumped farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, we can say that the distance the mouse jumped is greater than or equal to the distance the grasshopper jumped. In other words, 3x >= x. Simplifying this inequality, we get x <= 3. Since x is a positive number (the distance the grasshopper jumped), we can conclude that x = 1. Therefore, the mouse jumped at least 3 times as far as the grasshopper, which means it jumped at least 3 meters.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and needs to add 9 more (14 - 5 = 9). So she needs to add 9 cups of flour. As for sugar, we know that she needs 6 cups in total, so she should add 1 cup of sugar (6 - 5 = 1) since she has already added 5 cups.  
So, Mary needs to add 9 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar to complete her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour and needs to add 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour.  To find out how much sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed:  9 - 4 = 5 So, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of sugar. Since there are 11 cups of sugar in total, Mary needs to add 5 / 11 = 0.45 or approximately 1/2 cup of sugar.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some amount of flour (not specified in the question), and she needs to add more flour than sugar. So we can start by subtracting the amount of sugar from the total amount of flour needed.  
Total amount of flour needed = 6 cups +? (since she already added some) Total amount of sugar needed = 13 cups -? (since she already added some) Since she needs to add more flour than sugar, we can set up an equation based on this information: Let x be the number of cups of flour Mary still needs to add. Then, we have: Total amount of flour needed - x = Sugar needed + x Now we need to solve for x. First, let's calculate the total amount of sugar needed: 13 cups - x (since she already added some) Next, we can substitute the values we know into the first equation: Total amount of flour needed - x = 13x + x Now simplify: Total amount of flour needed - x = 14x To find x, we can divide both sides by 14: x = Total amount of flour needed / 14 In our case, the total amount of flour needed is 6 cups +?, so we can plug that value in: x = (6 +?) / 14 Simplify: x = 7 / 14 Therefore, Mary needs to add 7/14 cups of flour to make the cake."
Response:  We know that Mary needs 2 cups of flour more than sugar. So if she has already added some flour, then she must have added less than 2 cups of flour. Since there are 7 cups of sugar in the recipe, and Mary needs 2 cups more flour, we can set up an equation:   Flour needed = Sugar - (Sugar x 2)  Substituting the values, we get:   Flour needed = 7 - (7 x 2)  Simplifying, we get:   Flour needed = 7 - 14  Which simplifies to:   Flour needed = -7  Since Mary cannot have negative flour, we know that she must have added less than 2 cups of flour. Therefore, the correct answer is:   Mary added 1 cup of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to the recipe and needs to add 6 more cups of flour. So, in total, she will need to add  3 + 6 = 9 cups of flour.  Now let's look at the original recipe. It calls for 11 cups of sugar and some amount of flour (not specified). Since we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, the remaining amount of flour needed is  11 - 3 = 8 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of flour required by the recipe is  9 + 8 = 17 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary needs 2 cups of flour (12 - 2 = 10). If she has already added some flour, then she must have added 10 - x cups of flour, where x is the number of cups of flour she had already added. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  10 - x + 2 = 12 (since she needs 12 cups of flour in total) Simplifying the equation:  8 = x Solving for x:  x = 8 Therefore, Mary has already added 8 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we can subtract what she has already added from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe.   Total amount of flour = 9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups So, Mary still needs 6 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to the recipe. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe.   Total amount of sugar = 14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups So, Mary needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 cups of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 10 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour, and the recipe calls for 12 cups in total. So we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add.   To do this, we can subtract the amount she already has from the total amount needed: 12 - 11 = 1 cup of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add one more cup of flour to make the cake batter.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much flour Mary needs to add. To do this, subtract what she has already added (7 cups) from the total amount of flour needed (10 cups):  10 - 7 = 3 So, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour. Next, let's calculate how much sugar and salt she needs to add. Since there are 2 cups of sugar in the recipe, and Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, she needs to add half of the remaining amount of sugar (2 / 2 = 1 cup). As for salt, since there are 80 cups of it in the recipe, and Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, she needs to add half of the remaining amount of salt (80 / 2 = 40 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, and 40 cups of salt to her mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, so she needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 more cups of flour.  For sugar, we need to add 14 - 2 = 12 cups.  And for salt, we need to add 7 - 2 = 5 cups.  So, Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour, 12 cups of sugar, and 5 cups of salt to her mixture.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour (муки) to the dough. So, she needs to add more flour according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour in total. Therefore, she still needs to add  6 - 5 = 1 cup of flour. Now let's move on to sugar and salt. We are given that the recipe requires 8 cups of sugar (сахар) and 7 cups of salt (соль). Since Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, she will need to add an equal amount of sugar and salt. Thus, she needs to add  8 - 5 = 3 cups of sugar and  7 - 5 = 2 cups of salt. To summarize, Mary needs to add 1 cup of flour, 3 cups of sugar, and 2 cups of salt to her dough to make the cake according to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar to the recipe, and the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar in total. So, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:  13 - 2 = 11 cups of sugar left to add. Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the recipe, so she needs to add  9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (9 cups total - 2 cups = 7 cups). To make the cake, she needs to add 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. So, we can calculate how much more flour she needs as follows:  7 cups (flour) + 6 cups (sugar) = 13 cups Total amount of ingredients needed for the recipe. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the batter. So, she needs to add  14 - 11 = 3 more cups of flour. Now, let's look at the sugar. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 11 cups of flour. To find out how much sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe: 5 - (14 - 11) = 5 - 3 = 2 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 cups of sugar and 3 cups of flour to her batter.
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 5 cups of flour more than sugar. So if she has already added some flour, then she must have added less than 5 cups of flour. Since there are 10 cups of flour in total, we can set up an equation as follows:  
Let x be the number of cups of flour Mary has already added. Then we can write:  
x + 5 = 10... (1) Now we need to find out how much sugar Mary needs. We know that she needs 3 cups of sugar. So we can write:  
3 = x + 5... (2) Solving equation (2) for x, we get:  
x = 2... (3) Substituting this value into equation (1), we get:  
2 + 5 = 10... (4) Simplifying equation (4), we get:  
7 = 10... (5) This is true! Therefore, Mary has added 2 cups of flour so far."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 12 cups of flour in total and she has already added some flour. So we can set up an equation as follows:  12 - x = 13 (since she has already added 13 cups) Now solve for ""x"" to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already added:  12 - x = 13 Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us: x = 1 To check our work, let's plug in the value of x into one of the original equations: 5 + x =?  If x = 1, then 5 + 1 = 6, which is correct! Therefore, Mary has already added 1 cup of flour."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we need to subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe. Total amount of flour = 14 cups - 7 cups = 7 cups So, Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour to her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar to the recipe. To find out how much more sugar she needs, we need to subtract what she has already added from the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe. So let's do that:  11 (cups of sugar called for) - 10 (cups of sugar already added) = 1 (cup of sugar still needed).  Therefore, Mary needs one more cup of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour and the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour in total. So, she needs to add  10 - 6 = 4 more cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (14 - 4 = 10). To make the cake, she needs to add 9 more cups of flour. Since there are 16 cups of flour in total (10 + 9), we can see that Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour.   So, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (2 x 8 oz = 16 oz), so she needs to add  7 - 2 = 5 more cups of flour.  To find out how much sugar and salt she needs to add, we can use the ratios in the recipe:  Sugar:Flour = 9:7, Salt:Flour = 4:7.  Since Mary is adding 5 more cups of flour, she will need 5 x 9/7 = 7 sugar and 5 x 4/7 = 2 1/2 teaspoons of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour (6 x 2 = 12). To make the cake, she needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt. Since she has already added 12 cups of flour, she needs to add more sugar than salt. So, let's calculate how much more sugar she needs to add.  First, we can find out how many cups of sugar she needs in total:  11 + 12 = 23 cups of sugar. Now, let's subtract the amount of sugar she has already added (12): 23 - 12 = 11 cups of sugar left to add. Finally, we need to divide the remaining sugar by 2 to get the exact number of cups she needs to add: 11 / 2 = 5.5 cups of sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5.5 cups of sugar more than the amount of salt she has already added (9 cups).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the recipe, and the total amount of sugar needed is 7 cups. So we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed:  7 - 4 = 3  Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar to the recipe. So, she needs to add more flour than sugar to balance out the ingredients. Secondly, there are 14 cups of flour in the recipe, and since she has already added 10 cups of sugar, she needs to add 4 cups (14 - 10 = 4) more flour to the mixture. Therefore, the final answer is 4 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain and 60 families of birds have migrated for the winter. To find out how many more families have migrated than have stayed, we need to subtract the number of families that have stayed (19) from the total number of families that migrated (60). So, the difference is:  60 - 19 = 41. Therefore, more than 41 families of birds have migrated for the winter compared to the number of families that have stayed behind.
Response:  If 7 families of birds have migrated to warmer climates for winter, then there are 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds that remain in the area near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 20 families of birds migrated for the winter and 14 families remained. To find out how many families lived near the mountain initially, we can subtract the number of families that left (20) from the number of families that stayed (14):  14 - 20 = -6 So, there were 6 fewer families of birds living near the mountain at first than there are now. Therefore, there were originally 14 + 6 = 20 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that in total there are 85 families of birds living near the mountain.  If 23 families flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia, then we can subtract these numbers from the total number of families to find out how many families remained near the mountain.  23 + 37 = 60 (number of families that migrated) 85 - 60 = 25 (number of families remaining near the mountain)  Therefore, there are 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
Response:  We know that in total, there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain.  42 families of birds flew to Africa and 31 families of birds flew to Asia. To find out how many more families flew to Africa than to Asia, we need to subtract the number of families that flew to Asia from the total number of families.  Total number of families = 8 So, if 42 families flew to Africa and 31 families flew to Asia, then: Number of families flying to Africa = 42 Number of families flying to Asia = 31 Subtracting the two numbers gives us: Difference = 42 - 31 = 11 Therefore, 11 more families of birds flew to Africa than to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain. If 47 families flew to Africa and 94 families flew to Asia, we can find out how many more families flew to Asia than to Africa by subtracting the number of families that flew to Africa from the total number of families that flew to Asia.   So, if 47 families flew to Africa and 94 families flew to Asia, then: Number of families that flew to Asia - Number of families that flew to Africa = Total number of families that flew to Asia - Total number of families that flew to Africa To solve for the difference between the two numbers, we need to add the number of families that flew to Africa (47) to the number of families that flew to Asia (94): Difference = 94 + 47 = 141 Therefore, more families flew to Asia than to Africa. The correct answer is 141.
Response:  We know that there are 18 families of birds living near the mountain. If 38 families flew to Africa and 80 families flew to Asia, how many families remained near the mountain? To find out, we can subtract the number of families that left for each continent from the total number of families. So, if 38 + 80 = 118 families left (Africa + Asia), then 118 - 18 = 100 families remained near the mountain. Therefore, 100 families of birds have migrated to warmer climates for the winter.
Response:  If there were initially 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families have joined them, then the total number of families of birds living near the mountain would be:  87 + 18 = 105 families of birds live near the mountain now.
Response:  We know that 59 families of birds left for wintering grounds and 24 new families arrived from the Arctic. To find out how many families are remaining near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of families that left from the total number of families before they left. Total number of families = 49 + 24 = 73 So, the number of families remaining near the mountain is:  73 - 59 = 14
Response:  If 27 families of birds migrated away from the mountain for the winter, and there were initially 41 families living near the mountain, then we can subtract 27 from 41 to find out how many families are left.  41 - 27 =?  The correct answer is: 14 families of birds remained near the mountain after migration.
Response:  If initially there were 45 families of birds near the mountain and 86 families migrated for the winter, then the number of families that remained near the mountain can be found by subtracting 86 from 45:  45 - 86 =? The result is:  -41 So, 41 families of birds remained near the mountain, while 86 families migrated for the winter.
Response:  We know that there are 41 families of birds living near the mountain. If 35 families flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa, we can find out how many more families flew to Africa than to Asia by subtracting the number of families that flew to Asia from the total number of families that flew to Africa.   So, if 35 families flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa, then:  62 - 35 = 27 families flew to Africa more than to Asia.
Response:  We know that 26 new families of birds arrived from the Arctic to live near the mountain, and 2 families left to migrate even further south for the winter. So, if we subtract 2 from 26, we get:  26 - 2 = 24 families of birds remained near the mountain.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 253 pencils as a gift. Secondly, we know that he lost or gave away 70 of them. So, to find out how many pencils are left with him, we need to subtract the number of pencils he lost from the total number of pencils he received. Here is the calculation:  253 - 70 =?  The result is: 183. Therefore, there are 183 pencils left with Paul at the end of the school year.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received some number of pencils on his birthday, which we will call x.  We also know that he lost or gave away 551 pencils during the school year, so the number of pencils he has left is 177 (x - 551).   Now we need to find out what value of x gives us the correct result for the number of pencils he has left. To do this, let's write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  x - 551 = 177  Simplifying the equation by subtracting 551 from both sides gives us:  x = 238  So, Pol received 238 pencils on his birthday.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 440 pencils as a gift.  Next, we know that he gave 111 pencils to his friends. So, how many pencils does he have left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of pencils he gave away from the total number of pencils he received:  440 - 111 =?  That gives us:  329  Therefore, Pol has 329 pencils left.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 65 pencils as a birthday gift.  Second, we know that he gave away 213 pencils to his friends during the school year.  Third, we know that he lost 16 pencils.  To find out how many pencils were lost or given away, let's subtract the number of pencils he gave away from the total number of pencils he had:  65 - 213 = -148  Since the result is negative, it means that Pol lost 148 pencils (148 + 16 = 164) during the school year.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 589 pencils and gave 571 to his friends. This means he has given away 571 - 589 = 18 pencils less than he received. Now, let's calculate how many pencils he lost. We know that he lost 161 pencils. So, if we subtract the number of pencils he lost from the number of pencils he gave away, we get:  571 - 161 = 410 pencils more than he gave away. Therefore, Pol gave away more pencils (410) than he lost (161).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received 110 pencils in total as a birthday gift. Secondly, he gave away 90 pencils to his friends. So, how many pencils does he have left?   To find out, subtract the number of pencils he gave away from the total number of pencils he received:  110 - 90 = 20  Therefore, Pol has 20 pencils left. Now, let's calculate how many pencils he lost. We are told that he lost 412 pencils. So, if he had 20 pencils left and lost 412 pencils, then he must have lost more than twice as many pencils as he had left:  412 > 2 x 20 = 40  This means that Pol lost more than twice as many pencils as he had left. In other words, he lost more than 40 pencils.  The correct answer is:  More than 40 pencils.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received some colored pencils as a gift on his birthday and gave them to his friends throughout the school year. We also know that he lost some of those pencils. So let's start with what he has left. He has 332 colored pencils left. Now, if he gave 563 pencils away, then how many did he have at first? To find out, we can subtract the number of pencils he had left from the total number of pencils he gave away:  332 = 563 - x  X is the number of pencils he had at first. Solving for x, we get:  x = 563 - 332  x = 231  Therefore, Pol received 231 colored pencils on his birthday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received 52 boxes of crayons as a gift on his birthday. Secondly, he lost 535 crayons during the school year. Finally, he has 492 crayons left. So let's start with what he had at first:  52 x 10 = 520 crayons + 535 crayons = 1055 crayons Now subtract how many crayons he has left: 1055 - 492 = 563 crayons were lost or given away. Therefore, Pol lost or gave away 563 crayons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received 521 pencils and 66 erasers as gifts on his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 154 pencils left. So, to find out how many pencils were lost or given away, we need to subtract the number of pencils he had at the end of the school year from the total number of pencils he received as gifts.  521 - 154 =?  That gives us an answer of 367 pencils. Therefore, Pol lost or gave away 367 pencils during the school year.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 531 pencils and 38 erasers as gifts.  Second, we know that he had 391 pencils left at the end of the school year.  So, to find out how many more pencils he had than erasers, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the total number of pencils:  531 - 38 =?  Yes! There are 493 more pencils than erasers (531 - 38).
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 601 pencils and 406 erasers as gifts. This means he had a total of 601 + 406 = 1007 items.  Now, we are told that at the end of the school year, Paul had 336 pencils left. So, how many erasers did he have? We can set up an equation based on this information:  336 (pencils) + x (erasers) = 1007 (total items)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 671  Therefore, there were more erasers than pencils left with Paul at the end of the school year. Specifically, he had 671 erasers and 336 pencils.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol received 315 caran dishas as a gift and he lost or gave away all of them except for 291. So, to find out how many carandashes he received, we can subtract the number he has left (291) from the total number he had (315):  315 - 291 =?  The result is:  315 - 291 = 24  Therefore, Pol received 24 carandashes on his birthday.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 267 pencils as a gift and lost 231 of them during the school year. This means he has 36 pencils left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, we know that he gave 308 pencils to his friends. So, how many more pencils did he give away than he had left? To find out, subtract the number of pencils he had left from the number of pencils he gave away:  308 - 36 = 272. Therefore, Pol gave away 272 pencils more than he had left.
Response:  First, we know that Pol received 457 la...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the waiter served 11 clients in total. After some of them left, he was left with 3 clients. So, if we subtract the number of clients who left from the total number of clients, we get:  11 - 3 = 8 Clients left. Therefore, more than 8 clients left than remained.
Response:  If an officiant served 3 clients and some left, then he has fewer than 3 clients remaining.   Since there are 4 clients remaining, we can say that 1 client remained, and 2 clients left.
Response:  We know that the waiter had 12 clients after 9 left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  12 = x + 9 (where x is the number of clients the waiter had at first) Now solve for x:  x = 12 - 9 x = 3 Therefore, the waiter had 3 clients at first.
Response:  If an officiant served 14 clients and 5 left, then he has 14 - 5 = 9 clients left.   Therefore, there are 9 clients left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the waiter served 13 clients initially and after some of them left, he had 9 clients left. So, if we subtract the number of clients who left from the initial number of clients, we get:  13 - 9 = 4 Therefore, 4 clients left the restaurant.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 12 clients were served and 15 left, so the number of clients who left is 15 - 12 = 3. Now, we have 12 - 3 = 9 clients remaining. Next, we are told that 14 new clients arrived, so the total number of clients now is 9 + 14 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 clients left with the waiter.
Response:  We know that the waiter served 3 clients initially and had 8 clients in total (including the initial 3). So, the number of new clients who arrived is:  8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the waiter had 8 clients initially and after some left, he was left with 5 clients. So, the number of clients who left = 8 - 5 = 3.   Next, we are told that 99 new clients arrived, so the total number of clients now is 5 + 99 = 104. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  First, we know that the waiter had 12 clients to start with. If some of them left, then he must have had fewer than 12 clients after they left. We don't know exactly how many left, so let's call the number of clients who left x. So, the waiter had 12 - x clients after some of them left. Then, 10 new clients came in, so now the waiter has 12 - x + 10 clients. To find out how many clients the waiter has now, we need to add the number of clients he had before and the number of new clients who came in. Therefore, the total number of clients the waiter has now is:  12 - x + 10 =? Solution: Plugging in x = 3 (to represent three clients leaving), we get:  12 - 3 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19 clients. Therefore, the waiter currently has 19 clients.
Response:  Dan spent $2 on a chocolate bar, so he has $3 - $2 = $1 left. Therefore, Dan had $1 initially.
"Response:  Dan had $4 and spent some money to buy a chocolate bar. Now he has $3 left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  4 - x = 3 Where ""x"" is the cost of the chocolate bar. Solving for ""x"", we get:  4 - x = 3 3 = 4 - x 3 = 1 To find out how much the chocolate bar costs, we need to add 1 to both sides of the equation:  3 + 1 = 4 + 1 4 = 5 Therefore, the chocolate bar costs $5."
"Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $3 x 99 = $297 on chocolate bars. So, he has $4 - $297 = $0 left.  

Question: What is the value of x in the equation 5x + 18 = 46? 
Answer: To solve for x, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation: 5x = 46 - 18 5x = 28 Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to find x: x = 28/5 x = 5"
"Response:  Dan has $3 and he bought two chocolates at $4 each. So, we can write an equation to represent the situation:  3 + (2 x 4) =?  Now solve for the unknown variable ""?"" which represents the total cost of all chocolates.  3 + (2 x 4) = 3 + 8 = 11  Therefore, each chocolate costs $4."
Response:  First, we know that Dan has $2. Second, each chocolate bar costs $3, so he can buy  2/3 = 2/3 \* 10 = 6/10 = 6 chocolate bars.  Therefore, Dan bought 6 chocolate bars.
"Response:  Dan spent $2 + $3 = $5 on chocolate and candy. So he has $7 - $5 = $2 left.  

Question: Если у меня есть 10 апельсинов и я дам 3 апельсина своему другу, сколько апельсинов мне остается? 
Answer:  Great! Let's count together. If you have 10 apples and give 3 to your friend, then you have 10 - 3 = 7 apples left."
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spent $7 for chocolate bar and $6 for chocolate. So, how much did he spend in total?   Total amount = $7 + $6 = $13.  Therefore, Dan spent $13.
Response:  Dan spent $6 on chocolate and $3 on chocolate. So he spent a total of $6 + $3 = $9 on chocolate. Since he only had $2 to start with, he must have spent all $2 on the chocolate. Therefore, he spent $2 more on the chocolate bar than on the chocolate.
Response:  Dan spent $3 + $2 = $5 dollars on chocolates. So he spent $5 - $3 = $2 dollars more on the second chocolate than the first one.
"Response:  First, Dan spent $8 on chocolate, so he has $4 - $8 = -$4 left. But then his friend gave him $5, so now he has $4 - $8 + $5 = $1 left.  

Question: What is the value of x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20? 
Answer: To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 3x = 20 - 5 3x = 15 Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 15 / 3 x = 5"
"Response:  We know that Dan had $4 at the beginning and he spent some money to buy a chocolate bar. Now he has $3 left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  4 - x = 3 Where ""x"" is the cost of the chocolate bar. Solving for ""x"", we get:  x = 1 Since Dan had $4 and now he has $3, the difference between these two amounts is equal to the cost of the chocolate bar:  $4 - $3 = $1 Therefore, the chocolate bar cost $1."
Response:  Dan spent $3 on chocolate bars, so he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.   Therefore, there are $1 left.
Response:  Dan spent $4 in total and bought 2 chocolate bars, so each bar costs $4/2 = $2.   Therefore, each chocolate bar costs $2.
Response:  Dan spent $3 + $7 = $10 on two chocolate bars. To compare how much he spent on each bar, we need to divide the total amount he spent ($10) by the number of bars he bought (2): $$ \frac {10} {2} = 5 $$ So, Dan spent $5 on each chocolate bar.
Response:  Dan spent $7 + $2 = $9 on two chocolate bars. To find out how much he spent on each bar, we can divide the total amount he spent by the number of bars he bought: $9 / 2 = $4.50 per bar. So, he spent $4.50 more on the first bar than on the second one.
Response:  First, we know that Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them at the garage sale. So, to find out how many books he has left, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had.  115 - 78 =?  That gives us... 115 - 78 = 37  Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Pol had 137 books at first and sold them all at the garage sale. So, he started with 137 books. Now, we are told that after the sale, he has 105 books left. Therefore, we can subtract 105 from 137 to find out how many books he had initially:  137 - 105 =?  The result is:  137 - 105 = 32.  So, there were 32 books that Pol had initially before selling any of them at the garage sale.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol had 108 books initially. After selling some books at the garage sale and giving away 35 books to his friend, he has 62 books left. So, we can set up an equation as follows:  108 - x = 62, where x is the number of books sold at the garage sale. Solving for x, we get: x = 46. Therefore, Pol sold 46 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had 50 books initially. After buying some at the garage sale, he has 151 books in total. So, to find out how many books he bought, let's subtract the initial number of books from the total number of books:  151 - 50 =?  The correct answer is 101.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had 2 books initially. After selling some at the garage sale, he has 58 books now. So, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows:  58 - 2 = 56 books sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol had 21 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. So, he has 15 books left with him now (21 - x = 15, where x is the number of books sold). Now, he bought 42 new books. So, the total number of books he has now is 15 + 42 = 57. Therefore, the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is:  57 - 21 = 36.  Hence, Pol sold more books than he bought.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had 71 books initially. After selling some at the garage sale, he has 116 books now (71 + 38 = 116). So, to find out how many more books he bought than sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he has now.   Total number of books now = 116 Books sold =? To find out the number of books sold, let's use algebra. Let x be the number of books sold. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given: 71 + x = 116 Subtracting 71 from both sides gives us: x = 45 Therefore, Paul sold 45 books at the garage sale. Now, to find out how many more books he bought than sold, we can subtract the number of books sold from the total number of books he has now: 116 - 45 = 71 So, Paul bought 71 more books than he sold.
Response:  First, we know that Pol had 108 books and 55 notebooks in total. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he has 66 books and 59 notebooks left. So, to find out how many books he sold, let's subtract the number of books he has now from the number of books he had before:  108 - 66 =?  This gives us 42 books that Pol sold at the garage sale.
Response:  First, we know that Pol had 51 books and 106 pens before the garage sale. After the garage sale, he has 82 books and 14 pens left. Now let's focus on the number of pens he sold at the garage sale. We can set up an equation based on the information given:  51 - x = 14 (where x is the number of pens sold) Since there are 106 pens in total, we can write:  51 - x + 106 = 14 To solve for x, add both sides of the equations:  157 = 2x x = 78 So, Pol sold 78 pens at the garage sale.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Pol sold some books at the garage sale and now he has 27 books left. Secondly, we know that initially he had 136 books. So, if we subtract the number of books he sold from the initial number of books, we can find out how many books he sold.  27 (books left) = 136 (initial books) - x (books sold)  We are looking for ""x"" which is the number of books sold. Now solve this equation to get your answer.  x = 136 - 27  x = 109  Therefore, Pol sold 109 books at the garage sale."
Response:  First, we know that Pol had 134 books initially. Then, he gave 39 books to his friend, so now he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Next, he sold some books at the garage sale, and after that, he had 95 - x books left, where x is the number of books he sold. We are asked to find out how many books he sold. So, let's set up an equation based on this information:  95 - x = 68  To solve for x, we can add 95 and -x:  95 + (-x) = 68  Simplifying:   95 + (-x) = 68  95 - x = 68   x = 27  Therefore, Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  First, let's calculate how many books Poll had before the garage sale:  95 ручек x 153 книги = 14,075 books. Now, let's find out how many books he has after the garage sale:  13 книг x 23 ручек = 309 books. So, Poll sold 14,075 - 309 = 13,766 books at the garage sale.
Response:  First, let's calculate how many books Poll had before the garage sale:  42 ручки x 143 книги = 6086 books Before the garage sale, Poll had 6086 books and 42 pens. Now, let's see how many books he has after the garage sale:  113 книг x 19 ручек = 2177 books After the garage sale, Poll has 2177 books and 19 pens. To find out how many pens he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of pens he has now from the number of pens he had before:  42 - 19 = 23 pens So, Poll sold 23 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  First, we know that there were 10 roses in the vase initially.  Next, Jessica removed 8 more roses from her flower garden and placed them in the vase.  So, if we add 10 (initial number of roses) to 8 (number of roses added), we get:  10 + 8 = 18  Therefore, there are now 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  We know that there were some roses in the vase at first, and Jessica added 16 more roses from her flower garden to the vase. So, if we let x be the number of roses in the vase initially (x < 23), then we can write an equation based on the information given:  16 + x = 23  To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:  16 + x - 16 = 23 - 16  x = 7  Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at first.
Response:  First, we know that there were 2 roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase, so now there are 2 - 4 = 16 roses left in the vase. Next, she cut several new roses from her flower garden and placed them in the vase, bringing the total number of roses to 16 + x, where x is the number of new roses she cut. We know that there are now 23 roses in the vase, so we can set up an equation:  16 + x = 23  To solve for x, we subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:   x = 23 - 16  x = 7  So, Jessica cut 7 new roses from her flower garden and placed them in the vase.
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 15 roses in the vase and she threw away 33 roses. So, if we subtract 33 from 15, we get:  15 - 33 = -18 Now, we know that there were 18 fewer roses after she threw them away than before. But then she also added some new roses from her flower garden to the vase. We don't know how many exactly, but let's assume it was x number of roses. So, now we have:  15 - 33 + x =? To find out what x is, we can solve for it by adding both sides of the equation:  15 - 33 + x + x =?  Simplifying:  2x + 15 - 33 =?  Combine like terms:   2x + 15 = 33  Subtract 15 from both sides:   2x = 18  Divide both sides by 2:    x = 9  Therefore, Jessica added 9 new roses to the vase. She threw away 33 roses more than she added. So, the difference between the two is:  33 - 9 = 24
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 21 roses in the vase initially. Then she threw away 34 roses from the vase and picked some new ones from her flower garden to put back into the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses she threw away (34) from the initial number of roses (21), we get:  21 - 34 = -13  This means that Jessica threw away more roses than she picked from her garden!
Response:  First, we know that there were 7 roses in the vase initially.  Next, Jessica removed some more roses from her flower garden, which had 59 roses in total.  So, if she removed some of those 59 roses, then there would be fewer than 59 roses left in her garden.   Now, let's look at the problem: We know that there are now 20 roses in the vase (7 + x, where x is the number of roses Jessica removed).  And we also know that Jessica removed some roses from her garden, leaving her with fewer than 59 roses.  Can you use this information to figure out how many roses Jessica removed?
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 12 roses in her flower garden.  Second, she cut several more from her garden to put in the vase, so the total number of roses in the vase is 13 (the original 12 + the additional ones).  Finally, we are asked how many roses remain in the garden. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of roses in the vase (13) from the original number of roses in the garden (12), which gives us:  12 - 13 = -1  So, there are -1 roses remaining in the garden. This means that all the roses have been picked and none remain in the garden!
Response:  First, we know that there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase initially.  Next, we are told that Jessica removed some roses and orchids from her flower garden to add to the vase.  We can let R represent the number of roses she added and O represent the number of orchids she added.  So, the total number of flowers in the vase after Jessica added more flowers is:  15 + R + O =?  Since there are now 17 roses in the vase, we can set up an equation:  15 + R + O = 17  To solve for R (the number of roses), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:  15 + R + O = 17 - 15  This simplifies to:   R + O = 2  Now, we need to find out how many orchids Jessica added.  We know that there are 96 orchids in the vase now, so we can set up another equation:  62 + O = 96  Subtracting 62 from both sides gives us:   O = 34  Finally, we can use these two equations to find out how many roses Jessica added:  R = 2 - 15  This simplifies to:   R = 2  Therefore, Jessica added 2 roses to the vase.
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 12 roses and 2 orchids in her vase.  Next, we know that she removed some roses and orchids from her garden to put into the vase.  We are told that there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase.  To find out how many orchids Jessica removed from her garden, let's subtract the number of orchids she already had (2) from the total number of orchids in the vase (21):  21 - 2 = 19  So, Jessica removed 19 orchids from her garden.
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 5 roses and 3 orchids in her flower garden.  Next, she cut several more roses and orchids from her garden to put into the vase.  So, let's call the number of roses she added to the vase x (since there were 5 original roses).  And let's call the number of orchids she added y (since there were 3 original orchids).  Now, we can write an equation based on what we know:  5 + x = 12 (roses) 3 + y = 2 (orchids)  We have two equations and two unknowns.  Can you solve for x and y using substitution or elimination?
Response:  First, we know that Jessica had 7 roses and 12 orchids in her flower garden.  Next, we know that she cut some more roses and orchids from her garden to put into the vase. So, let's say she added x roses and y orchids to the vase. Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  7 + x = 11 (since there are now 11 roses in the vase) 12 + y = 20 (since there are now 20 orchids in the vase) We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving for x, we get: x = 4 (since there are 4 more roses in the vase than before) And solving for y, we get: y = 8 (since there are 8 more orchids in the vase than before) Therefore, there are 4 more roses and 8 more orchids in the vase than before. In other words, there are 4 more roses and 8 more orchids now than there were originally in Jessica's flower garden.
Response:  We know that Jessica put 19 roses in the vase and there were already 3 roses in the vase initially. So, we can say that Jessica added 19 - 3 = 16 roses to the vase.   Therefore, Jessica cut 16 roses from her flower garden to place in the vase.
Response:  First, we know that there were originally 13 roses in the vase and Jessica removed some of them. So, if she removed x roses, then there would be 13 - x roses left in the vase.   Next, we know that there are now 14 roses in the vase after Jessica added more roses to the vase. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:  13 - x + 14 = 91  To solve for x (the number of roses Jessica removed), we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 13 from both sides of the equation:  14 - x = 91 - 13  This simplifies to:  27 = x  Therefore, Jessica removed 27 roses from her garden to put into the vase.
Response:  We know that in the vase there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids. After Jessica removed some of them, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses left. So we can start with this information:  16 (roses) + 3 (orchids) =? (total) Now let's subtract the number of roses that Jessica removed:  16 - 13 =? (remaining roses) Since Jessica removed 13 roses, we have:  16 - 13 = 3 (remaining roses) Now we need to find out how many orchids Jessica removed. To do this, we can subtract the remaining number of orchids from the original number of orchids:  3 - 7 =? (removed orchids) Since Jessica removed 7 orchids, we have:  3 - 7 = -4 (removed orchids) Finally, we add up all the numbers we found to get our final answer:  3 (remained orchids) + 3 (remained roses) + (-4) (removed orchids) =? Total: 3 + 3 + (-4) = 2 (total) Therefore, Jessica removed 4 orchids and 13 roses from the vase.
Response:  First, we know that there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase initially.  Next, Jessica removed some roses and orchids from her flower garden to add to the vase.  So, let x be the number of roses Jessica added to the vase, and y be the number of orchids she added.   Now, we can write an equation based on the information given:  21 (orchids) + x (roses) = 6 (initial roses) + y (initial orchids)  Simplifying the equation:  21 + x = 6 + y  Solving for x:  27 = 5x  x = 5  Therefore, Jessica added 5 roses to the vase.  To find out how many more roses than orchids are now in the vase, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses:  5 - 21 = -16  There are 16 fewer roses than orchids in the vase now.
Response:  First, we know that there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase initially.  Next, Jessica removed some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put into the vase. We are told that now there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So let's compare the number of orchids to the number of roses:  13 orchids - 3 roses = 10 more orchids than roses.  Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now.
Response:  First, we know that Robin had 17 inches of hair and cut some off. Second, we know that her new length is 13 inches. Finally, we can subtract the new length from the original length to find out how much she cut off.  17 - 13 = 4 So Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.
"Response:  If Robin cut off 20 inches of her hair and now it is 10 inches long, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.  
Let x be the original length of Robin's hair before she cut it. Since she cut off 20 inches, we know that her new hair length is 10 inches + 20 inches = 30 inches.  So, if Robin's hair was originally x inches long, its new length after cutting is 30 - x inches long. Now we need to find out what value of x makes this equation true. To do so, we can subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:  
30 - x = 10 + 20 30 - x = 30  X = 70  Therefore, the original length of Robin's hair before she cut it was 70 inches."
Response:  First, Robin cut off 11 d...
Response:  First, we know that Robin's hair was 19 inches long to start with.  If they grew an additional 18 inches, then the total length of her hair now would be:  19 + 18 = 37 inches.  So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.
Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of her hair and she had 14 inches of hair initially, then we can subtract 13 from 14 to find out how long her hair is now.  14 - 13 =?  That gives us an answer of 1. So, Robin's hair is now 1 inch long.
Response:  First, Robin had 14 inches of hair and it grew by 8 inches, so now she has 14 + 8 = 22 inches of hair. Then, she cut off 20 inches, so her current length of hair is 22 - 20 = 2 inches. Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 2 inches long.

Response:  Firstly, Danny had 30 wrappers and he found 22 caps in the park. So, if we subtract the number of caps from the total number of wrappers, we get:  30 - 22 = 8 wrappers that were not found.  Now, Danny has 17 caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. If we add the number of caps to the remaining wrappers, we get:  8 + 17 = 25 wrappers.  Therefore, there were 25 wrappers initially with Danny.

Response:  First, we know that Danny has collected 71 kryshkas and 24 obterok in the park.  Secondly, he currently has 28 kryshkas and 16 obterok in his collection.  To find out how many more kryshkas than obterok Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of obterok from the number of kryshkas:  28 - 16 = 12.  So, there are 12 more kryshkas than obterok in Danny's current collection.
Response:  First, we know that Danny has collected 10 kryshek and 62 obrket in the park. This means he has a total of  10 + 62 = 72 items in his collection.  Next, we are told that Danny now has 27 kryshek and 43 obrket in his collection. This means he has a total of  27 + 43 = 70 items in his collection.  So, there are 70 - 72 = 2 fewer obrket than kryshek in Danny's collection.  Therefore, there are 2 more obrket than kryshek in Danny's collection right now.
Response:  Firstly, Danny had collected 66 cola bottle caps and lost 66 of them in the park. So, he has only 25 cola bottle caps left with him now. Now, let's calculate how many cola bottle caps Danny had initially.   To do this, we need to subtract the number of caps that Danny lost (66) from the number of caps that he has currently (25).  Therefore, the initial number of cola bottle caps that Danny had is:  25 - 66 =?  The answer is: 39.
Response:  First, we know that Danny had 25 kryshek in his collection before he found some in the park.  Second, we know that after he found some in the park, he had 32 kryshek in his collection.  Third, we can subtract the number of kryshek he had before from the number of kryshek he has now to find out how many new kryshek he found in the park.   So, if we subtract 25 (the number of kryshek he had before) from 32 (the number of kryshek he has now), we get:  32 - 25 = 7  Therefore, Danny found 7 new kryshek in the park!
Response:  Firstly, Danny had 60 old bottle caps and he found 58 new ones. So, in total, Danny has  60 + 58 = 118 bottle caps.  Now, we know that Danny has 67 bottle caps in his collection, so we can subtract the number of bottle caps he had initially from the total number of bottle caps he has now to find out how many bottle caps he had initially:  118 - 67 = 51.  Therefore, Danny had 51 bottle caps initially.
Response:  Firstly, Danny found 50 new co...
"Response:  Firstly, Danny threw away 54 old bottle caps and found 48 new ones in the park. So, if we subtract the number of old bottle caps he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he had before going to the park, we get:  
52 (total) - 54 =?  Now let's add the number of new bottle caps he found in the park to this difference:  
? + 48 = 52  Simplifying, we get:  
? = 6  Therefore, Danny threw away more than he found in the park. He threw away 6 more bottle caps than he found."
Response:  Firstly, Danny had 82 obertk and 29 kryshes.  Secondly, he has 42 kryshes and 61 obertk now. So we can start with the equation:  82 + 29 = 42 + 61 Now let's solve for x (the number of kryshes):  82 + 29 = 42 + 61 82 + 29 = 42 + 61 101 = 103 1 = 3 Therefore, Danny had 3 more kryshes initially than he currently has in his collection.
Response:  Firstly, Danny had 66 obertk and 39 kryshes.  If he has 16 kryshes now, then he must have collected 66 - 16 = 50 obertk.   Therefore, Danny initially had 50 obertk.
Response:  First, we know that Danny found 46 obertk and 50 kryshes on the park. This means he has a total of  46 + 50 = 96 items in his collection.  Next, we know that he currently has 21 kryshes and 52 obertk in his collection. So, let's subtract the number of kryshes and obertk he currently has from the total number of items he found on the park:  96 - 21 - 52 =?  To find out how many more kryshes than obertk Danny found, we need to subtract the number of obertk he has from the number of kryshes he has:  21 - 52 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  52 - 21 = 31.  Therefore, Danny found 31 more kryshes than obertk on the park.
Response:  First, we know that Danny found 5 kryshes and 65 obertak at the park. This means he has a total of 70 items in his collection (5 + 65). Next, we are told that he currently has 31 kryshes and 9 obertak. So, let's subtract the number of kryshes and obertak he already has from the total number of items he found at the park:  70 - 31 = 39  39 - 9 = 30  Therefore, Danny found 30 more obertak than kryshes at the park.
Response:  First, we know that Danny has 11 obertk and 12 kryshes in his collection now.   To find out how many more kryshes than obertks he has, we need to subtract the number of obetks from the number of kryshes.  So, if we do this, we get:  12 (kryshes) - 11 (obertks) =?  Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  First, we know that Danny has 15 kryshek and 18 oborotok in his collection now.   Secondly, he has 67 oborotok and 35 kryshek altogether. Now let's subtract the number of kryshek he had before from the total number of kryshek he has now:  35 - 15 = 20 So, Danny has 20 more krysheks than before.   Next, let's do the same for oborotok:  67 - 18 = 49 So, Danny has 49 more oborotok than before. Therefore, Danny has more oborotok (49) than kryshek (20).
Response:  If Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Stephen, and Jake has 17 persimmons, then we can set up an equation to represent the situation.  17 - 11 =?  This gives us:  17 - 11 = 6  So, Stephen has 6 more persimmons than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 15 persimmons and Jill has more than Jack but fewer than Steven. So we can start with these two pieces of information:  
Jack has less than Jill, so let's say Jack has x persimmons.  Jill has more than Jack, so Jill has x + 1 persimmons.  Now we know that Steven has 15 persimmons, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (x + 1) = 15  Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 1 = 15  Solving for x:  
x = 8  Therefore, Jack has 8 persimmons."
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fewer persimmons than Stephen, and Stephen has 19 persimmons in total. So, we can start with the equation:  19 - 18 =?  This simplifies to:  19 - 18 = 1  Now, we know that Dill has 13 more persimmons than Jake. Therefore, we can write another equation based on this information:  1 + 13 =?  This simplifies to:  14 =?  Finally, we can substitute the value of 19 from our first equation into the second equation to find out how many persimmons Dill has:  14 = (19 - 18) + 13  Simplifying, we get:  14 = 1 + 13  Which gives us the final answer:  Dill has 14 persimmons.
"Response:  We know that Steven has more persimmons than Jill and less than 8 persimmons. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
Let S be the number of persimmons Steve has. Then we have: 
S > J (since Steve has more persimmons than Jill)  And: 
S < 8 (since Steve has fewer persimmons than 8)  Now let's find out how many persimmons Jill has. Since Steve has more persimmons than Jill, we know that Jill has fewer persimmons than Steve. So we can write: 
J = S - 1  Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve them to find out how many persimmons Jill has and how many persimmons Jack has?"
Response:  We know that Steven has 4 persimmons more than Jill, so if Jill has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 4 persimmons.  We also know that Jack has 12 persimmons less than Steven, so if Steven has x + 4 persimmons, then Jack has (x + 4) - 12 = x + 4 - 12 persimmons.   Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + 4 - 12 = x + 4  Solving for x gives us:  x = 8  So Jill has 8 persimmons and Jack has 8 - 12 = -4 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 16 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons that Jake has from the number of persimmons that Steven has, we can find out how many persimmons Jake has.  16 - x = y (where x is the number of persimmons Jake has and y is the difference between 16 and the number of persimmons Jake has)  Since Jake has more persimmons than Dill, we know that Jake has at least 9 persimmons more than Dill. Therefore, we can write an inequality based on this information:  x > 9 + d (where d is the number of persimmons that Dill has)  Now we have two equations and one inequality. Can you use them to solve for x, the number of persimmons that Jake has?
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 7 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 8 more persimmons than Dill. So, if Stephen has 17 persimmons, then Jake has  17 - 7 = 10 persimmons. Now, since Jake has 10 persimmons, Dill must have  10 + 8 = 18 persimmons. Therefore, Dill has 18 persimmons.
"Response:  First, we know that Jake has 9 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 18 more persimmons than Dill. So, if S is the number of persimmons Stephen has, then J has = S - 9 and D has = S + 18. We also know that Dill has 16 persimmons. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:  
S - 9 + 18 = 16  
2S = 34  
S = 17  
J = S - 9 = 17 - 9 = 8  
D = S + 18 = 17 + 18 = 35  
Therefore, Stephen has 17 persimmons, Jake has 8 persimmons, and Dill has 35 persimmons. Now, let's compare the number of persimmons Stephen has with the number of persimmons Dill has:  
Stephen has 17 persimmons, while Dill has 35 persimmons. So, Dill has 35 - 17 = 18 more persimmons than Stephen."
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 18 more persimmons than JILL. So if Jill has 5 persimmons, Steven has 18 + 5 = 23 persimmons.   Now we know that STEVEN has 23 persimmons and JAYK has 6 fewer persimmons than STEVEN. Therefore, JAYK has 23 - 6 = 17 persimmons.  So, JAYK has 17 persimmons.
"Response:  First, we know that STEVEN has more persimmons than JAYK. So if Jayk has x persimmons, Steven must have x + y persimmons, where y is the difference between their amounts.  
Second, we know that Dill has fewer persimmons than Steven. So if Steven has x + y persimmons, Dill must have x - z persimmons, where z is the difference between their amounts.  
Third, we know that Jayk has less persimmons than Dill. So if Dill has x - z persimmons, Jayk must have x - z - w persimmons, where w is the difference between their amounts.  
Now let's substitute the values we know into these equations and solve for x. We know that Dill has 87 persimmons, so we can set up the following equation based on this information:  
x - z = 87  
Since Dill has fewer persimmons than Steven, we know that z > 0. Therefore, we can write:  
x - z = 87  
x = 87 + z  
Now we need to find the value of z. To do this, we can use the fact that Steven has more persimmons than Jayk. We know that Jayk has x persimmons, so Steven must have x + y persimmons. Since Steven has more persimmons than Jayk, we know that y > 0. Therefore, we can write:  
x + y = (x + y) + z  
2x + y + z = 87 + z  
Simplifying this equation, we get:  
3x + y + z = 174  
Now we can substitute the value of y from the first equation:  
3(87 + z) + z = 174  
261 + 3z = 174  
3z = 90  
Z = 30  
Therefore, Jayk has 30 more persimmons than Dill. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:  
x - 30 = 87  
x = 117  
So Jayk has 1"
Response:  First, we know that STEVEN has more persimmons than JILL. So if Jill has 12 persimmons, Steven must have at least 12 + x persimmons, where x is the number of persimmons more than Jill.   Second, we know that JAYK has fewer persimmons than STEVEN. So Jayk has 16 - x persimmons.  Now let's equate these two inequalities:  12 + x > 16 - x  Can you solve for x and find out how many more persimmons Dill has than Jack?
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 persimmons and 14 apples.  So, if Jake has m fewer persimmons than Steven, then Jake has  19 - m persimmons.  And we also know that Jake has 79 more apples than Steven, so Jake has  14 + 79 = 93 apples.  Now, let's use these two equations to find out how many persimmons Jake has.  First, solve for m in the equation  19 - m = persimmons.  We can do this by subtracting 19 from both sides of the equation:  19 - m = 19 - 19 = 0.  Therefore, m = 0.  This means that Jake has no persimmons!  But wait, we were told that Jake has some persimmons.  So, there must be another way to solve this problem.  Here's an alternative solution:  Instead of using the first equation, we can use the second equation to find out how many apples Jake has:  93 = 14 + 79.  Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:  85 = 79.  Therefore, Jake has 85 apples.  Since Jake has 85 apples and 19 persimmons, he has a total of 85 + 19 = 104 fruits.
Response:  We know that Steven has 9 persimmons and 8 apples.  If Jake has 13 persimmons less than Steven, then Jake has  9 - 13 = 6 persimmons.  And if Jake has 3 apples more than Steven, then Jake has  8 + 3 = 11 apples.  So, Jake has 6 persimmons and 11 apples.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 6 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 8 more apples. So if Stephen has x persimmons, Jake has x - 6 persimmons. We also know that Jake has 8 more apples than Stephen, so Jake has x + 8 apples. Now let's equate these two statements:   x - 6 = Jake's number of persimmons (x) + 8 = Jake's number of apples  Simplifying the equation:   x = 12 + 8 = 20  Therefore, Jake has 20 persimmons and 20 + 8 = 28 apples.  To find out how many more apples than persimmons Steven has, subtract the number of persimmons from the total number of apples:  28 - 20 = 8  So, Steven has 8 more apples than persimmons.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 3 fewer persimmons than Steven and 10 more apples. So if Steven has x persimmons, then Jake has x - 3 persimmons. We also know that Steven has 12 persimmons and 15 apples. Therefore, we can set up two equations based on this information:   Equation 1: x + (x-3) = 12... (1)   Equation 2: x + (x-3) = 15... (2) Now let's solve these equations simultaneously to find out how many persimmons and apples each person has. To do this, we will add equation (1) to equation (2):   Equation 3: 2x + x - 6 = 27... (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get:  3x = 27... (4) Dividing both sides of equation (4) by 3, we get:   x = 9... (5) Now that we have found out how many persimmons and apples each person has, we can compare them to see who has more of which fruit. Based on equation (5), Steven has 9 persimmons and 15 apples, while Jake has 9 - 3 = 6 persimmons and 10 + 3 = 13 apples. Therefore, Steven has more persimmons than Jake, but Jake has more apples than Steven.
Response:  Firstly, we know that STEVEN has 12 persimmons and JASON has fewer than 12 persimmons. Secondly, we are told that there are 67 more persimmons with Stephen than with Dill. So let's start by subtracting the number of persimmons Jason has from the total number of persimmons Stephen has:  12 - x = 67 + x (where x is the number of persimmons Jason has) Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:  0 = 67 + x Solving for x, we get:  x = 55 Therefore, Jason has 55 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven by 12. So Jake has  18 - 12 = 6 persimmons. Now we need to find out how many persimmons Dill has. We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven by 8. Therefore, Dill has  18 + 8 = 26 persimmons. 
Response:  First, we know that STEVEN has 19 persimmons. Next, we are told that JAKE has fewer persimmons than STEVEN and more persimmons than DILL. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons STEVEN has from the total number of persimmons JAKE has, we can find out how many persimmons JAKE has.  19 - x = 72 + x (since JAKE has more persimmons than DILL) Subtracting 19 from both sides gives us: x = 53 Now we have found out that JAKE has 53 persimmons.
"Response:  We know that Steve has 14 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steve but more than Dill. So we can start with an equation based on these two facts:  
Jake has (14 - x) persimmons, where x is the number of persimmons Dill has. Since Jake has less than Steve, we know that (14 - x) < 14. Now let's add the information that Dill has 3 more persimmons than Jake:  
Dill has (14 - x) + 3 = (14 - x) + 3 persimmons. Substituting for Jake's persimmons, we get:  
Dill has (14 - x) + 3 = (14 - x) + 3 = 14 - x + 3 persimmons. Simplifying, we have:  
Dill has 11 persimmons. Therefore, Dill has 11 persimmons."
Response:  We know that Steven has 13 persimmons and 52 apples. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons from the total number of fruits he has, we can find out how many apples he has:  52 - 13 = 39  Now, let's use the information that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven to find out how many apples Jake has:  39 + 84 = 123  Since Jake also has persimmons, we need to find out how many persimmons he has based on the information that he has fewer persimmons than Steven. We can do this by subtracting the number of persimmons Steven has from the total number of fruits Jake has:  123 - 52 = 71  Therefore, Jake has 71 persimmons.
Response:  We know that Steven has 8 persimmons and 12 apples. So, we can start by listing what he has:  8 persimmons 12 apples Now, it says that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven must have x - 12 apples. Since Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, we can set up an equation based on this information:  13 = x - (x - 12) Simplifying the equation, we get:  13 = 2x - 12 Solving for x, we get:  x = 15 Therefore, Jake has 15 apples.
Response:  First, we know that Jake has 8 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 10 more apples. So if Stephen has x apples, Jake has x - 8 apples.   Now, let's find out how many persimmons each of them has. We know that Stephen has 18 persimmons, so Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 persimmons.  Therefore, there are 10 persimmons more in Stephen's basket than in Jake's basket.
"Response:  First, we know that Jack has 3 persimmons fewer than Steve and 4 apples more. So if Steve has x apples, Jack has x - 3 apples. We also know that Steve has 15 persimmons, so Jack has 15 - 3 = 12 persimmons. Now let's add up all the fruit that each person has:  
For Steve: x apples + 15 persimmons = 19 apples + 15 persimmons For Jack: (x - 3) apples + 12 persimmons = 19 apples + 12 persimmons Solving for x, we get: x = 16 (since Jack has 12 persimmons and 4 apples more than Steve) Therefore, Steve has 16 apples and 15 persimmons, while Jack has 12 persimmons and 4 apples less than Steve.  To find out how many more apples Steve has than persimmons, subtract the number of persimmons from the number of apples:  
Apples - Persimmons = 16 - 15 = 1 More apples than persimmons."
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $78 in her purse. Second, she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, how much does she have left? To find out, we can subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she had: $78 - $15 =?  Can you solve for the missing number and tell me the correct answer?
"Response:  First, we know that Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket.  Second, we know that she has $33 left.  So, if we subtract what she spent from what she has left, we can find out how much money she had initially.  
$33 - $78 =?  Can you solve for x (the amount of money Olivia had initially)?"
"Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $100 in her purse before she withdrew money from the ATM.  Next, we know that she withdrew an additional $148 from the ATM.  So, the total amount of money Olivia had after withdrawing money from the ATM is:  
$100 + $148 = $248  Now, we know that Olivia spent some of this money at the supermarket. We are told that she had $159 left after shopping. So, let's subtract the amount she spent at the supermarket from the total amount of money she had:  
$248 - $159 = $99  Therefore, Olivia spent $99 at the supermarket."
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $3 in her purse before she withdrew money from the ATM and went to the supermarket.  After withdrawing money from the ATM, she had $49 left.  So, let's calculate how much more she spent at the supermarket than what she withdrew from the ATM:   $49 - $3 = $46  Therefore, Olivia spent $46 more at the supermarket than what she withdrew from the ATM.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $53 in her purse before she withdrew money from the ATM.  Next, we know that after visiting the supermarket, she had $14 left. So let's subtract the amount she had before going to the supermarket ($53) from the amount she had afterward ($14):   $53 - $14 = $39  Therefore, Olivia spent $39 more at the supermarket than she withdrew from the ATM.
Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $106 in her purse before going to the store. After spending money at the supermarket and the showroom, she has $26 left. So let's calculate how much she spent at each place:   At the supermarket: Total amount spent = Amount left - Amount spent At the showroom: Total amount spent = Amount left - Amount spent We can start with the equation for the supermarket:   Total amount spent = $106 - x Where x is the amount spent at the supermarket. Now we know that Olivia has $26 left after visiting both stores, so we can set up an equation for the total amount spent at both places:   $106 - x + $26 = $26 This simplifies to:   $106 - x = $50 Solving for x gives us:   x = $56 Therefore, Olivia spent $56 at the supermarket. Next, we can use the same method to find out how much she spent at the showroom:   Total amount spent = $106 - x + $26 = $26 This simplifies to:   $106 - x = $30 Solving for x gives us:   x = $46 Therefore, Olivia spent $46 at the showroom.
"Response:  First, we know that Olivia had $54 in her purse initially.  After she went shopping at the supermarket, she was left with $29. So, to find out how much she spent, we can subtract the amount she had left from the initial amount:  
$54 - $29 = $25  Therefore, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket."
"Response:  First, we know that Olivia spent $38 in the supermarket. So, if we subtract $38 from her initial amount of money ($128), we get:  
$128 - $38 =?  Can you solve for the remaining amount of money Olivia has?"
"Response:  If Dave had 19 applications and he deleted 5 of them, then the number of remaining applications would be:  
19 - 5 =?  Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Dave had 5 applications left after removing 18 of them. So, we can start with the equation:  5 - 18 =?  This gives us:  5 - 18 = x  Now we need to solve for ""x"" (the number of apps Dave had initially). To do this, we add 18 to both sides of the equation:  5 + 18 = x + 18  Simplifying, we get:  23 = x  Therefore, Dave had 23 applications on his phone initially."
Response:  Dave had 10 applications on his phone and added 11 new ones. This means he has a total of 21 applications (10 + 11). If he removed some apps and ended up with 4, then he must have deleted 17 apps (21 - 4 = 17).
"Response:  First, Dave had 21 applications on his phone. He added 89 new ones. So, in total, he has 21 + 89 = 110 applications. Then, he removed some of them, and now he has 24 left. Therefore, he deleted 110 - 24 = 86 applications. Since he deleted more than he added (86 > 89), the correct answer is ""more""."
Response:  Dave had 15 applications before adding new ones. After adding 71 new apps, he has 14 remaining. To find out how many more he deleted than added, we need to subtract the number of new apps from his original total.  15 (original) - 71 =?  The difference between these two numbers is how many more apps Dave deleted than added.  So, Dave deleted 56 more apps than he added.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he is left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave removed, let's subtract the number of applications he has now (5) from the number of applications he had initially (16):  16 - 5 = 11  Therefore, Dave removed 11 applications.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 21 files and he deleted some of them so now he has 7 files left.  To find out how many files he deleted, we can subtract 7 from 21:  21 - 7 = 14 So, Dave deleted 14 files.
Response:  First, we know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he has 21 applications and 4 files left. So, let's compare the number of applications to the number of files:   Number of Applications = 21   Number of Files = 4 To find out how many more applications than files are left on Dave's phone, subtract the number of files from the number of applications:   Number of More Applications = Number of Applications - Number of Files = 21 - 4 = 17 Therefore, there are 17 more applications than files left on Dave's phone.
"Response:  First, we know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he has 6 applications and 15 files left. So, let's calculate how many files are left:  15 (files) =? (applications) +? (files) We can solve for ""?"" by using the fact that there were initially 19 applications and 18 files:  19 (applications) + 18 (files) = 6 (applications) +? (files) Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:  13 (applications) +? (files) =? (files) Now we can see that there are 13 more applications than files. Therefore, there are 13 x 2 = 26 more files than applications. So, there are 26 more files left on Dave's phone than applications."
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his phone and now he has 18, then we can conclude that he added one more application to his phone. So, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 15 applications and 59 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he is left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave removed, let's subtract the number of applications he has now (12) from the number of applications he had initially (15):  15 - 12 = 3  Therefore, Dave removed 3 applications.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he is left with 17 applications and 21 files. Now, let's calculate how many files he removed. We can do this by subtracting the number of files he has now (21) from the number of files he had initially (24). So, 24 - 21 = 3. Therefore, Dave removed 3 files.
"Response:  First, we know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he has 5 files and 12 applications left. So, to find out how many more applications are left on his phone than files, we need to subtract the number of files from the total number of applications.  

Subtracting 5 (files) from 24 (applications): 

24 - 5 =? 

Answer: 19 

Therefore, there are 19 more applications left on Dave's phone than files."
Response:  Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone initially. After removing some apps and files, he has 24 files and 2 applications left. So, we can start by listing down what we know:   Applications: 2 (remaining after removal) Files: 24 (remaining after removal) Now, let's compare the number of files to the number of applications remaining: Number of files = 24 Number of applications = 2 As you can see, there are more files than applications remaining on Dave's phone. The difference between the two numbers is: Difference = Number of files - Number of applications = 24 - 2 = 22 Therefore, there are 22 more files than applications remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  If Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has  242 - 136 = 106 cards left.  So there are 106 cards left with Nell.
Response:  We know that Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff and now she has 154 cards left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  301 - 154 =?  To solve for the unknown number of cards (in this case, the number of cards Nell had initially), we can subtract 154 from both sides of the equation:  301 - 154 =?  301 - 154 = 147  Therefore, Nell had 147 cards initially.
Response:  First, we know that Nell had 528 cards and Jeff had 11 cards. So, if Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff, she would have fewer cards than before.   Second, we are told that after giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 252 cards left. This means that the number of cards she gave to Jeff must be equal to the difference between 528 (the number of cards she started with) and 252 (the number of cards she has left).  Using subtraction, we can calculate this difference as follows:  528 - 252 = 276  Therefore, Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, the number of cards she has now is 535. To find out how many cards Jeff has, we need to subtract the number of cards Nell has from the total number of cards she had:  566 - 535 =?  That gives us 31. Therefore, Jeff has 31 cards.

Response:  Nell had 246 cards with baseball players and 214 cards with 10-year-olds. If she gave some of her cards to Jeff, then the number of cards she has left must be equal to the sum of the two numbers. So we can set up an equation:  246 + 214 = 404 (baseball players) + x (10-year-olds)  Where x is the number of cards she has left with 10-year-olds.  Now we can solve for x:  460 = 246 + x  246 = x - 214  214 = x   The number of cards she has left with 10-year-olds is 214 more than the number of cards she has left with baseball players.  Therefore, the answer is:  214 more than 404 = 618
Response:  First, we know that Nell had 573 cards in total. Second, she gave John 195 cards, so now she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. Third, she also gave some cards to Jeff, but we don't know how many yet. Finally, she has 378 - x cards left, where x is the number of cards she gave to Jeff. To find out how many cards she gave to Jeff, we can set up an equation based on what we know:  378 - x = 210 (since she has 210 cards left after giving cards to both John and Jeff) Now solve for x:  378 - x = 210 Subtracting 378 from both sides gives us:  0 = 210 - x Subtracting both sides gives us:  x = 168 So, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.

"Response:  First, we know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ""10"" cards.  If she gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, then the number of baseball cards she has left is:  239 - x (where x is the number of cards given to Jeff)  We also know that she has 38 ""10"" cards, so the total number of cards she has left is:  239 - x + 38  Now, we are asked how many ""10"" cards are more than the number of baseball cards. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:  38 + (239 - x) - 239 = 38 + (x - 239)  Since we want to find out how many ""10"" cards are more than the number of baseball cards, we can simplify the equation as follows:  38 + x - 239 =?  Can you solve for x and tell me the answer?"
Response:  We know that Paco ate 19 pelmeni and there were 35 left. To find out how many he had initially, we can subtract the number of pelmeni he ate from the total number of pelmeni left.  35 - 19 =?  Yes, that's right! There were 16 pelmeni left after Paco finished eating. So, he had 16 + 19 = 35 pelmeni to start with.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. He has 7 cookies left. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  28 - x = 7 Where ""x"" is the number of cookies Paco ate. To solve for ""x"", we can add both sides of the equation together:  28 + (7) = 35  Now we have our solution! Paco ate 21 cookies (28 + 7 = 35)."
Response:  First, Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them. That means he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought 37 more cookies. So now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total.
Response:  First, Paco had 25 cookies and ate 5 of them, so he has 20 cookies left. Then he bought 3 more cookies, so now he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco ate more cookies than he bought (20 - 3 = 17).
Response:  First, Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. That means he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he bought 36 more cookies. So, in total, he has 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, Paco bought more cookies than he ate (36 - 2 = 34).

Oops, looks like he gave 15 more cookies than he ate himself!
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 22 sweet pastries and 75 salty pastries in total.  Second, we know that he ate 15 sweet pastries and 54 salty pastries.  So, to find out how many sweet pastries are left, we need to subtract the number of sweet pastries he ate from the total number of sweet pastries he had:  22 - 15 =?  That gives us:  22 - 15 = 7  Therefore, there are 7 sweet pastries left for Paco.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 9 sweet pastries and 6 salty pastries in total.  Second, we know that he ate 36 sweet pastries and 3 salty pastries.  Now let's calculate how many salty pastries are left:  9 (sweet pastries) - 3 (salty pastries eaten) = 6 (sal
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 37 sweet pastries and 11 salty pastries in total.  Second, we know that he ate 5 sweet pastries and 2 salty pastries.  So, to find out how many more sweet pastries he ate than salty ones, let's subtract the number of salty pastries he ate from the total number of salty pastries:  2 (salty pastries eaten) = 11 (total number of salty pastries) - 2 = 9  Now, let's do the same for the sweet pastries:  5 (sweet pastries eaten) = 37 (total number of sweet pastries) - 5 = 32  Therefore, Paco ate more sweet pastries (32) than salty pastries (9).

Response:  First, we know that Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So how many cookies does he have left?  13 + 14 = 27 cookies. Therefore, Paco has 27 cookies left.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 41 cookies and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Then we know that he ate 18 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies he ate is 18. Now let's compare the number of cookies he ate with the number of cookies he gave away:  18 > 9 (18 is greater than 9) This means that Paco ate more cookies than he gave away. Specifically, he ate 9 + 18 = 27 cookies more than he gave away.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 6 pechenyas and he gave 30 to his friend. So, how many did he give?  30 - 6 = 24 He gave 24 pechenyas to his friend. Now, let's look at how many he ate himself. We are told that he ate 23 pechenyas. So, how many more did he give away than he ate? To find out, subtract the number of pechenyas he ate from the number of pechenyas he gave away: 24 - 23 = 1 More than he ate. Therefore, Paco gave his friend one more pechenya than he ate himself.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 97 solenye pecheniya (solid cookies) and 34 svekolnye pecheniya (sweet cookies).  Second, we know that he ate 15 svekolnyh pecheniya (sweet cookies) and 56 solid pecheniya (solid cookies).  So, how many sweet cookies are left?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies that PaCO ate from the total number of sweet cookies he had:  34 - 15 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 19 sweet cookies left.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 26 solenye pecheniya (solenye = salted) and 17 svekolnykh pecheniya (svekolnye = sweet).  Second, we know that he ate 14 svekolnykh pecheniya (sweet) and 9 solenye pecheniya (salted).  So, how many solenye pecheniya are left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of sweets he ate from the total number of solenye pecheniya he had:  9 solenye pecheniya - 14 svekolnykh pecheniya =?  Can you do this subtraction and tell me the result?

Response:  First, we know that Paco ate 28 salty pastries and 15 sweet pastries. We can start by writing down what we know:  28 + 15 =?  Now let's add the two numbers together to find out how many in total:  28 + 15 = 43  So Paco ate 43 pastries in total. To determine how many more salty pastries he ate than sweet pastries, we need to subtract the number of sweet pastries from the total number of pastries:  43 - 15 =?  Subtracting 15 from 43 gives us:  43 - 15 = 28  Therefore, Paco ate 28 more salty pastries than sweet pastries.
"Response:  Gwen received $7 and she spent some money, so she has $5 left. To find out how much she spent, we can subtract what she had left from what she received:  
$7 - $5 =?  Can you solve for x?"
Response:  Gwen spent $8 and had $6 left, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:  8 + 6 =?  Now we know that Gwen received $6 more than she spent, so we can write:  8 + 6 = $6 + 8  Simplifying, we get:  14 = $14  Therefore, Gwen received $14 on her birthday.
"Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad, for a total of $6. She spent $3, so she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.  

Question: Она потратила $3 на что?  Answer: That's not specified in the question, but we know that she has $3 left after spending $3."
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 more from her dad, so she got a total of $8 + $5 = $13. She spent $4, so she has $13 - $4 = $9 left. To find out how much more she received from her mom compared to her dad, we need to subtract what she spent ($4) from what she had left ($9): $9 - $4 = $5. So, Gwen received $5 more from her mom than from her dad.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 more from her dad, so she received a total of $3 + $6 = $9. She spent $4, so she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. Therefore, she received $6 more from her dad than from her mom.
Response:  First, Gwen received $5 from her dad, so she had $5 + $0 = $5 in total. Then, her mom gave her an additional $7, so now she has $5 + $7 = $12. Finally, she spent $4, leaving her with $12 - $4 = $8. Therefore, Gwen received $7 more from her mom than from her dad.
"Response:  Gwen received $5 from her dad and $2 from her mom, for a total of $7. She spent $6 in total. So, she spent $5 from her dad and $1 from her mom ($6 - $2 = $4). Therefore, Gwen received an additional $4 from her dad compared to her mom.  

Question: A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Let's think step by step.  The bat costs $1 more than the ball, so the ball must cost $1.10 - $1 = $0.10."
Response:  If Josh had 9 glass balls and now he has 4, then he must have lost  9 - 4 = 5 glass balls.
Response:  If Josh had 21 glass balls and lost 21, then he has none left.   Therefore, there were 0 glass balls in his collection before he lost them all.  So, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 19 glass balls in his collection to start with. Then he lost 11 of them, so now he has 19 - 11 = 8 balls left. But wait! He also found 5 new ones, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 balls in total. So, there are 13 glass balls in Josh's collection now.
Response:  Josh had 4 glass balls in his collection initially, and he lost 16 of them. This means that he has 4 - 16 = -12 glass balls left. But then he found 8 new ones, so now he has -12 + 8 = 6 glass balls. Therefore, Josh found more new glass balls (8) than he lost (16), so he gained 8 - 16 = -8 glass balls.
Response:  Josh had 7 glass balls in his collection and lost 8 of them. This means he had 7 - 8 = -1 fewer ball than before. But then he found 10 new balls, so now he has  7 - 8 + 10 = 9 more balls than before. So, Josh found 9 more balls than he lost.
Response:  First, Josh had 21 marbles in his collection. Then he found 7 more marbles. So, how many marbles does Josh have now?   To find out, we need to add the number of marbles Josh already had (21) to the number of marbles he found (7). That gives us:  21 + 7 = 28  Therefore, Josh has 28 marbles in his collection now.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 20 glass balls in his collection. Second, he gave 2 glass balls to Jack. So, if we subtract the number of glass balls Josh gave to Jack (2) from the total number of glass balls Josh had (20), we can find out how many glass balls Josh has left.  20 - 2 = 18 Therefore, there are 18 glass balls left in Josh's collection.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 22 marbles in his collection.  Second, Jack gave him 20 more marbles. So, if we add 20 to 22, we get:  22 + 20 = 42. Therefore, there are now 42 marbles in Josh's collection.
Response:  If Josh had 19 glass balls and lost 11 of them, then he has 19 - 11 = 8 glass balls left in his collection.   Therefore, there are 8 glass balls left in Josh's collection now.
Response:  Josh had 22 glass balls in his collection and found 13 of them. That means he lost  22 - 13 = 9 balls. So, Josh has 13 - 9 = 4 glass balls left now.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 15 glass balls in his collection and found 9 of them. So, he has  15 - 9 = 6 missing balls. Now, we are told that he lost 23 balls. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls he lost and the number of balls he found is:  23 - 9 = 14. Since Josh had more balls than he found (6), it means that he lost more balls than he found. So, the answer is:  14.
Response:  Josh had 3 glass balls in his collection initially and found 6 new ones. So, he has a total of 3 + 6 = 9 glass balls now. However, he lost 5 balls, so he only has 9 - 5 = 4 glass balls left. Therefore, Josh found more glass balls (6) than he lost (5).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father collected blueberries together, and their combined weight was 4 pounds.  Since Marco's share of blueberries weighed 19 pounds, his father's share must have weighed less than 19 pounds.   Specifically, if Marco's clubnika weighed 19 pounds, then his father's clubnika would have weighed 4 - 19 = 2 pounds.  So, Marco's clubnika weighed twice as much as his father's clubnika.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the clubnica is 35 pounds and Marco's part weighs 13 pounds. So, to find out how much more his father's clubnika weighed than Marco's, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's clubnika from the total weight.  35 - 13 =?  The difference between the weight of his father's clubnica and Marco's clubnica is 22 pounds (35 - 13).
Response:  We know that the total weight of the clubnica collected by Marco and his father is 20 pounds. The weight of his father's clubnica is 17 pounds. Therefore, we can find out how much Marco's clubnica weighs by subtracting the weight of his father's clubnica from the total weight:   Clubnika Marco = Total weight - Father's clubnica weight  Clubnika Marco = 20 lbs - 17 lbs  Clubnika Marco = 3 lbs  So, Marco's clubnica weighed 3 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco's clubnics weighed 8 pounds and his father's clubnics weighed 32 pounds. To find out how much their combined weight was, we can add the two weights together.  8 + 32 = 40 So, the combined weight of Marco's and his father's clubnics was 40 pounds.
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father collected a watermelon that weighed 24 pounds. Secondly, we are told that Marco lost 9 pounds of the watermelon on the way back. Therefore, the weight of the watermelon that Marco has left is 3 pounds (since he lost 9 pounds). Now, let's find out how much the watermelon that Marco's father had. Since Marco lost 9 pounds, that means his father still has the original 24 pounds minus the 9 pounds that Marco lost, which equals 15 pounds (24 - 9 = 15). So, the watermelon that Marco's father had originally weighed 15 pounds.
"Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father collected a basket of strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. Secondly, we are told that Marco's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries on the way back home. Finally, we know that Marco has a basket of strawberries that now weighs 12 pounds. So let's use algebra to find out how much the basket of strawberries weighs for Marco's father. We can set up an equation as follows:  36 - 8 = 12 + x  Where ""x"" is the weight of Marco's father's basket of strawberries. To solve this equation, we subtract 8 from both sides:  36 - 8 = 12 + x  28 = 12 + x  16 = x  Therefore, the basket of strawberries weighs 16 pounds for Marco's father."
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father collected a basket of strawberries together, which weighed 22 pounds. Secondly, Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries on their way back home. So, in total, they have collected 52 pounds (22 + 30) of strawberries. Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's clubnik now is 52 pounds.
Response:  First, we know that Marco and his father collected blueberries. We are given that the total weight of their blueberries is 37 pounds (lb). Since Marco's blueberries weighed 15 lb, we can find out how much his father's blueberries weighed by subtracting Marco's from the total.  37 - 15 =?  Can you solve for this expression to determine how much his father's blueberries weighed?
Response:  First, we know that together the clubnik of Marco and his father weighed 17 pounds. Secondly, we are given that Marco's clubnik weighed 30 pounds. So if we subtract the weight of Marco's clubnik from the total weight of both clubniks, we can find out how much heavier Marco's clubnik was compared to his father's.  17 - 30 =?  The difference is 13 pounds. Therefore, Marco's clubnik was 13 pounds heavier than his father's clubnik.
Response:  First, we know that Marco's clubnik weighed 10 pounds. Second, we know that together their clubnik weighed 26 pounds. Third, we want to find out how much more his father's clubnik weighed than Marco's. To do this, subtract the weight of Marco's clubnik from the total weight of both clubnics:  26 - 10 = 16 pounds. So, his father's clubnik weighed 16 pounds more than Marco's.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father collected 30 pounds of blueberries.  If we subtract the weight of his father's blueberries from the total weight, we can find out how much Marco collected.  So, if Marco's clubnica weighed 11 pounds, then he collected (30 - 11) = 19 pounds of blueberries.   Therefore, Marco collected 19 pounds of blueberries.
Response:  We know that initially there were two children on the bus and then more children boarded at the stop. So, if we subtract the initial number of children (2) from the total number of children now (10), we get:  10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before they stopped.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that 26 children were already on the bus when it started its journey. Secondly, 38 more children boarded the bus at the stop. Therefore, to find out how many children are currently on the bus, we need to add 26 and 38. So, the total number of children on the bus now is:  
26 + 38 = 64 children."
Response:  We know that there were 2 children who boarded the bus at the stop, so we need to add this number to the original total of children who were already on the bus.   Total = Original + New  The problem states that there are now 41 children on the bus in total, so let's set up an equation:   Total = 41  Now we can solve for the original total of children:   Original + 2 = 41  Simplifying and solving for the original total:   Original = 39  So, before the two new children boarded the bus, there were 39 children on the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and now there are 21 left. So, we can subtract 43 from 21 to find out how many children got off the bus:  21 - 43 = -22  Since we cannot have a negative number of children getting off the bus, we know that at least 22 children must have gotten off the bus. Therefore, the answer is:  22 children got off the bus.
Response:  If 18 children are left on the bus after some children got off, then the total number of children who were on the bus before any children got off is 18 + x, where x is the number of children who got off. We know that 41 children were originally traveling in the bus, so we can set up an equation:  18 + x = 41. Solving for x, we get:  x = 23. Therefore, there were 23 children on the bus before anyone got off.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus and after some of them got out, there were 16 left. So we can start with this equation:  

21 - x = 16 

Where ""x"" is the number of children who got out of the bus. Now let's solve for ""x"".  To do this, we need to add both sides of the equation together:  

21 - x + x = 16 + x 

This simplifies to:  

3x = 5 

Now divide both sides by 3 to find ""x"":  

x = 5/3 

So 5 children got out of the bus at the stop."
Response:  We know that 5 children were on the bus to begin with and 63 children got off the bus. So, if we subtract 5 from 63, we get:  63 - 5 = 58 Now, we are told that some other children boarded the bus after others got off, but not all of them did so. Therefore, let's assume that x more children boarded the bus (x is a positive integer). To find out how many children were left on the bus, we can add the number of new passengers (x) to the original number of passengers (5): 5 + x = 14 Since there were 14 children left on the bus, we can set up an equation:  5 + x = 14 Solving for x, we get: x = 9 Thus, 9 more children boarded the bus than got off.
Response:  We know that 36 children were on the bus to start with, and some got off at the stop. So, if x is the number of children who got off the bus, then 36 - x is the number of children who remained on the bus. Now we are told that 68 children came out of the stop, so the total number of children who boarded the bus (including those who were already on it) is:  68 + (36 - x). Since only 12 children were left on the bus, we can set up the equation:  68 + (36 - x) = 12. Simplifying this equation, we get:  68 + 36 - x = 12. Solving for x, we find that:  x = 40. Therefore, there were 40 more children who got off the bus than the ones who boarded it.
Response:  We know that 22 children were initially in the bus and 40 children boarded the bus at the stop. This means that 40 - 22 = 18 more children got on the bus. Now, we are told that some of the children got off the bus at the stop, but we don't know how many. So let's assume that x children got off the bus. Since only 2 children remained on the bus after everyone else got off, we can set up the equation:  2 + x = 18. Solving for x, we get:  x = 16. Therefore, 16 children got off the bus at the stop.
Response:  We know that 28 children were originally on the bus and 82 children boarded the bus at the stop. This means that 82 - 28 = 54 more children boarded the bus than were already on it. Now we need to find out how many of those 54 children got off the bus. Since there are now 30 children left on the bus, we can subtract 30 from 54 to get the number who got off:  54 - 30 = 24 So, 24 children got off the bus. Therefore, more children boarded the bus (54) than got off (24).
Response:  We know that 23 children were initially in the bus and 24 children boarded at the stop. This means that 24 - 23 = 1 child more boarded the bus than those who started. However, we are told that some children got out of the bus, leaving 8 children remaining. So, if x children got out, then 24 - x = 8. Now we need to find out how many children got out of the bus so that the number of children left on the bus is equal to 8. To do this, we can subtract 8 from 24:  24 - 8 = 16. Therefore, 16 children got out of the bus.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 133 cakes in total. Secondly, we are told that he sold 51 of them. So, to find out how many more cakes the baker made than he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made:  133 - 51 =?  Yes, that's right! The baker made 82 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker prepared 54 cakes in total. Secondly, he sold some of them and had 13 left. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes, we can find out how many cakes he sold.  54 - 13 =?  Yes! That gives us 41. Therefore, the baker sold 41 cakes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker sold 145 torte...
Response:  If the baker made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140 of them, then the number of cakes left with the baker is:  155 - 140 = 15. So there are 15 cakes left with the baker.

Response:  First, we know that the baker sold 15 torte and 103 pastries.  So let's subtract the number of items he sold from the total number of items he prepared:  7 torte - 15 = x (where x is the number of torte remaining) 148 pastries - 103 = y (where y is the number of pastries remaining) Now we have two equations:  x + y = 7 (since 7 torte were prepared)  x + y = 148 (since 148 pastries were prepared) Can you solve for x and y now?
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pastries made is 126 + 48 = 174.  Next, we know that the number of torte...
"Response:  First, we know that the baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries in total. This means that if we add 19 and 131 together, we get:  19 + 131 = 150  Now, we are told that the baker sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries. If we subtract the number of items sold from the total number of items made, we can find out how many items were left over:  150 - 70 - 88 =?  To solve for the unknown quantity (in this case, the number of pastries), we need to isolate the variable (in this case, ""pastries"") on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 70 and 88 together and then subtracting the result from 150:  70 + 88 = 158 158 - 150 = 8 So, the baker has 8 pastries leftover. Therefore, the answer is 8."
Response:  First, we know that the total number of tor...
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pastries (torts and pirozhki) is 54 + 143 = 197.  Secondly, we know that the peka sold 68 torts and 92 pirozhki.  So let's subtract the number of pastries that were sold from the total number of pastries to find out how many pastries are left:  197 - 68 - 92 =?  Now we need to calculate how many more pirozhkis than torts were sold. To do this, we compare the number of pirozhkis sold with the number of torts sold:  92 > 68.  Therefore, there are more pirozhkis than torts sold.  The difference between the two numbers gives us the answer:  92 - 68 = 24.  There are 24 more pirozhkis than torts sold.
Response:  If the baker sold 44 cakes and initially made 48, then we can calculate how many cakes are left with him.  48 - 44 = 4. So there are 4 cakes left with the baker.
Response:  If the baker sold 8 torts and initially made 40 torts, then he has (40 - 8) = 32 torts left.   Therefore, the baker made more than he sold because he still has 32 torts in stock.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the baker initially made 169 tortes and his friend bought 137 of them. So, the number of tortes remaining with the baker is:  169 - 137 = 32.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 173 tortas. Then he bought 103 new ones, so he has a total of 173 + 103 = 276 tortas. Next, we know that he sold 86 tortas, so he has 276 - 86 = 190 tortas left. Therefore, there are 190 tortas left with the baker.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 99 cakes and sold 89 of them. This means he has 99 - 89 = 10 left over. Now, if he bought 167 new cakes, how many more did he buy than sell?  167 - 89 = 78. So, the baker bought 78 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 8 torte...
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 62 tortes at first. Then he made an additional 149 tortes. In total, the baker made 62 + 149 = 211 tortes. We also know that the baker sold 144 of these tortes. So, how many tortes will remain with the baker? To find out, we need to subtract the number of tortes sold from the total number of tortes made:  211 - 144 = 67 tortes will remain with the baker.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 81 torts at first. Then he made an additional 92 torts. In total, the baker made 81 + 92 = 173 torts. We also know that the baker sold 46 of them. So, the number of torts the baker has left is 173 - 46 = 127. Therefore, the baker made more than he sold (127 vs. 46).
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 61 pies and 167 cakes. If he sold 108 cakes and 44 pies, how many cakes and pies will be left with him?   To find out how many cakes are left, let's subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made:  61 - 108 =?  To find out how many pies are left, let's subtract the number of pies sold from the total number of pies made:  167 - 44 =?  Now add up the number of cakes and pies left to find out how many desserts the baker has left: ? +? =?  Can you solve for these variables and give me the final answer?
Response:  First, we know that the total number of baked goods (torte and cakes) is equal to the sum of the number of torte and the number of cakes. So, if the pekary sold 104 torte and 29 cakes, then the total number of baked goods he sold is:  104 + 29 = 133  Now, let's find out how many cakes are left with the pekary. We know that he made 56 cakes in total, so the number of cakes left with him is:  56 - 29 = 27  Therefore, there are 27 cakes remaining with the pekary.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 52 pies and 84 cakes. Next, we know that he sold 102 cakes and 94 pies. So let's start with the number of cakes he sold.  102 - 84 = 18 more cakes than he made. Now, let's look at the number of pies he sold. 94 - 52 = 42 more pies than he made. Finally, we can add up all these differences to find out how many more items the baker sold in total. 18 + 42 = 60 more items than he made. Therefore, the baker sold 60 more items (cakes and pies) than he made.
Response:  First, we know that the baker made 134 total pastries (including both cakes and cookies).  We also know that he sold 140 torte...
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pastries (torts and pirozhki) is equal to 14 + 153 = 167.  Next, we know that the peka sold 8 pirozhki and 97 torts.  So let's subtract the number of pirozhki and torts that were sold from the total number of pastries:  167 - 8 - 97 =?  The result is 62.  Therefore, the baker sold more torte than pirozhki.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pastries (torts and pirozhki) is 43 + 114 = 157.  We also know that the baker sold 154 pirozhki and 78 torts.  So let's subtract how many he sold from the total:  157 - 154 = 3.  That means the baker sold 3 more pirozhki than torts.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games and she wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, we can set up an equation based on this information.  
Let X be the number of games Kelly buys. Then, the total number of games Kelly will have is: 
Total Games = 22 + X  We know that Kelly wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, so we can write another equation: 
140 - 22 = X  Now we can solve for X by subtracting 22 from both sides of the second equation:  
118 = X  So, Kelly needs to buy 118 games to have 140 games left after buying some more."
"Response:  If Kelly has 106 games and gives away 64 games, then she will have  
106 - 64 = 42 games left.  So, Kelly will have 42 games left after giving away 64 games."
"Response:  Kelly had 92 games initially and gave away 91 of them. So, she has 1 game left with her.  

Question: If Sally had 5 apples and gave 3 to her friend, how many apples does Sally have now? 
Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Sally had 5 apples initially and gave 3 of them to her friend. So, she has 2 apples left with her."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many games Kelly has in total.   Total number of games = Number of Nintendo games + Number of Sony games Total number of games = 20 + 70 Total number of games = 90 Next, we need to find out how many games she needs to give up to have 12 Nintendo games left. To do this, we can subtract the number of Nintendo games she wants to keep (12) from the total number of Nintendo games she has (20): Number of Nintendo games to give up = Total number of Nintendo games - Number of Nintendo games wanted Number of Nintendo games to give up = 20 - 12 Number of Nintendo games to give up = 8 So, Kelly needs to give up 8 Nintendo games to have 12 Nintendo games left.
Response:  First, we need to subtract the number of games Kelly has for Nintendo from her total number of games to find out how many games she has left that are not for Nintendo.   Total Games = 46 (Nintendo) + 132 (Sony) = 178 games  Now let's subtract the number of Nintendo games from the total:  178 - 46 = 132 games left That means Kelly has 132 games left that are not for Nintendo.  To leave 31 games for Sony, she needs to give back 101 games (132 - 31).
Response:  First, we know that Kelly has 80 games for Nintendo and she found 31 more games. So, in total, she has 80 + 31 = 111 games. Now, if she wants to have only 6 games left, we need to subtract 6 from 111.  111 - 6 =?  Yes, that's right! Kelly needs to give away 105 games (111 - 6) to have only 6 games left.
Response:  If Randy used 52 blocks to build a tower and he has 38 blocks left, then we can subtract 52 from 38 to find out how many blocks he had initially.  52 - 38 =?  Yes, that's right! Randy had 14 blocks initially.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks in total and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he has 72 blocks left, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from 97 to find out how many blocks he used. So, the equation would be:  97 - 72 =?  The answer is:  25 blocks.
Response:  First, Randy used 14 blocks to build a tower. That means he has 79 - 14 = 65 blocks left. Next, he used 11 blocks to build a house. So now he has 65 - 11 = 54 blocks left. Therefore, there are 54 blocks remaining after Randy built both the tower and the house.
Response:  First, Randy used 27 blocks to build a tower. Second, he used 53 blocks to build a house. So in total, Randy used  27 + 53 = 80 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randi used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks she used for the tower than for the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks she used for the house from the number of blocks she used for the tower.  33 - 13 =?  Yes, that's right! She used 20 more blocks for the tower than for the house.
Response:  Randi used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks she used for building a house than for building a tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house.  79 - 82 =?  Yes, that's right! She used 3 more blocks to build a house than to build a tower.
Response:  If Randy used 36 blocks to build a tower, and he had 59 blocks in total, then he has 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left.   Therefore, there are 23 blocks left after Randy built his tower.
Response:  Randi used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks she used for the tower than for the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks she used for the house from the number of blocks she used for the tower.   So, if we subtract 20 from 50, we get: 50 - 20 = 30. Therefore, Randi used 30 more blocks to build the tower than she did to build the house.
Response:  Randi used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks she used for building a house than for building a tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house.   So, if we subtract 63 from 89, we get:  89 - 63 = 26  Therefore, Randi used 26 more blocks to build her house than to build her tower.
Response:  If there are 20 books in total and I have already read 5 of them, then I have not read  20 - 5 = 15 books yet. So, I have read 5 books so far.
"Response:  We know that we have read 13 books and there are still 8 books left to be read. So, in total, there must be 13 + 8 = 21 books in the series ""Suma..."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and we have already read 12 of them. So, to find out how many more books we need to read, we can subtract the number of books we have read from the total number of books:  22 - 12 = 10. Therefore, we still need to read 10 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in total.  If we have read 19 books (including all 4), then we still need to watch  17 - 4 = 13 more films.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series ""Suma..."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Suma..."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in total.  If we read 13 books, then we have read more than half of all the books (50% = 10/20).  Similarly, if we watched 12 films, we have watched less than half of all the films (50% = 11/22).  So, we have read more books than we have watched films.  
Numeric answer:  More books (13 - 12 = 1)"
"Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 films in total, then we can say that:  
Books = 11 Films = 17 So, if you read 7 books, you have not read any of the remaining 4 books (7 + 4 = 11). Similarly, if you watched 21 films, you have not watched any of the remaining 6 films (21 + 6 = 17). Therefore, the number of films you have watched more than the number of books is:  
Films - Books = 21 - 7 = 14"
Response:  If there are 14 books in the series and I have already read 8 of them, then I still need to read  14 - 8 = 6 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 62 films and 19 books in total.  If we have already watched 34 films and read 4 books, how many more books do we need to read?   To find out, we can subtract the number of books we have already read (4) from the total number of books (19):  19 - 4 = 15 So, we still need to read 15 more books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 films in total and we have already watched 4 of them. So, to find out how many more films we need to watch, we can subtract the number of films we have already watched from the total number of films:  8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, we still need to watch 4 more films.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 books and 15 books in the series ""Suma..."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films and 11 books in the series ""Suma..."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in total.  If we have watched 14 films (more than half of the total number of films), then we must have read at least 5 books (since we cannot have watched all 14 films without reading any books).   Now, let's count how many more books we have read compared to the number of films we have watched:   Books read = 5 (minimum)   Films watched = 14   To find out how many more books we have read, we need to subtract the number of films we have watched from the minimum number of books we have read:   More books read = 5 - 14 = -9   Since the result is negative, it means that we have watched more films than we have read books. Therefore, the correct answer is:   We have watched more films than we have read books.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in total.  If we read/watched 16 books and watched 19 films, then we can calculate how many more films we watched than books as follows:   Film count - Book count = 19 - 16 = 3 So, we watched 3 more films than books.
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and used some of them to buy game prizes, then he must have used at least 2 tickets to buy game prizes. So, we can set up an equation as follows:  7 - 2 = x  where x is the number of tickets Dave used to buy game prizes. Solving for x, we get:  7 - 2 = 5  Therefore, Dave used 5 tickets to buy game prizes.
Response:  We know that Dave used 12 tickets to buy some toys. So he has 14 - 12 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave won 12 + 2 = 14 tickets in the game room.
Response:  First, we know that Dave spent $5 on game tokens and $11 on clothing. So he has spent a total of $5 + $11 = $16.  Now, if he won 18 tickets and spent $16, then he must have $18 - $16 = $2 left.   Therefore, there are $2 worth of tickets remaining with Dave.
Response:  Firstly, Drew used 12 tickets to buy game stuff and 7 tickets to buy clothes. So he spent 12 + 7 = 19 tickets in total.   Now let's compare how many tickets Dave used for each item:   For game stuff: 12 tickets   For clothes: 7 tickets  To find out which one Dave used more of, we need to divide the number of tickets used for each item by the total number of tickets he used:   Game stuff: 12 / 19 = 0.63 or 63%   Clothes: 7 / 19 = 0.37 or 37%  Based on this calculation, Dave used more of his tickets (63%) to buy game stuff than to buy clothes (37%).
Response:  Firstly, Dave used 8 bi...
"Response:  First, we know that Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets. So, he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Next, we know that he spent 10 tickets on buying toys. Therefore, the number of tickets he has left is 12 - 10 = 2.  
So, there are 2 tickets left with Dave after spending 10 tickets on toys."
"Response:  If Hayley had 14 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, 9 of them died, then we can say that 5 trees survived (14 - 9 = 5). So, more trees died than survived.  

Therefore, the correct answer is 9 (the number of trees that died) minus 5 (the number of trees that survived), which equals 4. Therefore, 4 trees more died than survived in the typhoon."
"Response:  If Hayley had 13 trees in her backyard and 6 died during the typhoon, then she has 13 - 6 = 7 trees left after the typhoon. So, more trees survived than died.  

Question: What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11? 
Answer: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: 

2x + 5 = 11 
2x = 11 - 5 
2x = 6 

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: 

x = 6/2 
x = 3 

So, the value of x is 3."
Response:  If Hayley had 20 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, only 4 trees remained, then we can deduce that 16 trees (20 - 4 = 16) were destroyed or damaged during the typhoon.   Therefore, the correct answer is 16.
Response:  If Hayley had 5 trees that died after the typhoon and she has 12 trees left, then she had 5 + 12 = 17 trees in total before the typhoon.   Therefore, Hayley grew 17 - 5 = 12 trees in her backyard.
Response:  First, Hayley had 9 trees in her backyard before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 4 of them died, so she was left with  9 - 4 = 5 trees. Then, she planted 5 more trees, so now she has a total of  5 + 5 = 10 trees in her backyard.
Response:  If Hayley had 12 trees in her yard and two died after the typhoon, then she has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left in her yard.
Response:  If Hayley initially had 3 trees and after the typhoon, 13 trees were destroyed, then we can find out how many trees survived by subtracting the number of destroyed trees from the initial number of trees:  3 - 13 = -10  Since negative numbers indicate a decrease or loss, this means that 10 trees did not survive the typhoon. Therefore, only 3 trees survived (since 3 - 10 = 3).
Response:  If Hayley had 11 trees in her yard initially and 2 died during the typhoon, then she has 11 - 2 = 9 trees left after the typhoon. So, more than 2 trees survived the typhoon (9 - 2 = 7).
Response:  Firstly, we know that in one day, they collect 66 baskets of oranges. Secondly, each basket contains 28 oranges. Therefore, to find out how many oranges they collect in a day, we can multiply 66 (baskets) by 28 (oranges per basket):  66 x 28 = 1848 oranges They collect 1848 oranges in one day.
Response:  If they collect 8 baskets per day, then in one week (7 days) they will collect:  7 x 8 = 56 baskets. Therefore, it will take 56 / 24 = 2 days to collect 24 baskets of oranges.
Response:  We know that the harvesting will last for 4 days and they collected 56 baskets of oranges in total. So, we can calculate how many baskets they collect per day as follows: Total number of baskets / Number of days = Daily number of baskets  56 baskets / 4 days = 14 baskets per day Therefore, they collect 14 baskets of oranges per day.
Response:  We know that they collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges. So in one day, they collect:  38 x 42 = 1676 oranges.  If they collect for 49 days, then they will have collected:  1676 x 49 = 80,524 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they collect 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 oranges. So, in one day, they collect:  66 x 25 = 1650 oranges  In total, they will collect:  1650 x 87 = 143,950 oranges after 87 days of harvesting.
Response:  We know that they collect 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 oranges. So we can calculate how many oranges they collect in total as follows:  8 baskets x 35 oranges/basket = 280 oranges/day
"Response:  We know that each day they collect 16 baskets of oranges and in each basket there are 57 oranges. So to calculate how many days it will take to collect 80 baskets, we need to divide 80 by 16 (the number of baskets collected per day) and then divide by 57 (the number of oranges in each basket).  

So, here is the calculation:  

80 / 16 = 5 (days)  
5 x 57 = 285 (oranges)  
Therefore, it would take 5 days to collect 80 baskets of oranges."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each mesh contains 12 oranges and they collect 67 meshes per day. So, the total number of oranges collected in one day is:  67 x 12 = 804 oranges per day. Now, if they collect 35 meshers, then the total number of oranges collected will be:  35 x 12 = 420 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they collect 74 baskets per day and discard 71 of them. So, in one day, they keep 3 baskets (74 - 71 = 3). Now, let's calculate how many baskets they will have after 51 days of harvesting:  3 x 51 = 153 baskets. Therefore, after 51 days of harvesting, they will have 153 baskets of oranges.
Response:  Firstly, they collect 76 baskets per day and discard 64 of them. So, the number of baskets that are not discarded is:  76 - 64 = 12  Now we know that each basket contains 50 oranges, so the total number of oranges collected in a day is:  12 x 50 = 600 oranges  Therefore, the daily orange collection is 600 oranges.
Response:  We know that they collect 28 baskets of ripe oranges and 52 baskets of unripe oranges per day. If we assume that this continues for 26 days (since the harvest lasts for 26 days), then the total number of baskets collected can be calculated as follows: Total number of baskets = Number of baskets per day x Number of days = 28 + 52 = 80 baskets per day x 26 days = 2192 baskets So there will be 2192 baskets of oranges after 26 days of harvesting.
Response:  First, we know that they collect 82 baskets of ripe oranges and 61 baskets of unripe oranges per day. We can start with the number of days they will be harvesting.  How many days do you want to harvest?  25 days. Now let's calculate how many baskets of ripe oranges they will have after 25 days.  To do this, we need to multiply the number of baskets collected per day by the number of days they will be harvesting.  So, if they collect 82 baskets per day x 25 days = 2050 baskets of ripe oranges.
Response:  We know that they collect 31 baskets of ripe oranges and 24 baskets of unripe oranges per day. If we assume that each basket contains 10 oranges (this is just an assumption), then in one day they collect:  31 x 10 = 310 ripe oranges  24 x 10 = 240 unripe oranges Now let's calculate how many unripe oranges they will have after 45 days of collection:  240 x 45 = 10800 unripe oranges So, after 45 days, they will have 10800 unripe oranges.
Response:  We know that every day they collect 44 baskets of ripe oranges and 25 baskets of unripe oranges. To find out how many more baskets of ripe oranges are collected each day, we need to subtract the number of baskets of unripe oranges from the total number of baskets of ripe oranges.  44 - 25 = 19 So, 19 more baskets of ripe oranges are collected each day than unripe ones.
Response:  We know that every day they collect 5 baskets of ripe oranges and 74 baskets of unripe oranges. To find out how many more baskets of unripe oranges are collected than ripe ones, we need to subtract the number of baskets of ripe oranges from the number of baskets of unripe oranges.  5 baskets - 74 baskets =?  Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the result?
Response:  We know that in total they collected 54 baskets of oranges and we also know that each day they collected 18 baskets. So to find out how many days it took to collect all the oranges, we can divide the total number of baskets by the number of baskets collected per day:  54 baskets / 18 baskets/day = 3 days. Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all the oranges.
Response:  We know that they collected 56 baskets of oranges in total. And we are told that they collected them over 14 days. So, to find out how many baskets they collected per day, let's divide the total number of baskets by the number of days:  56 baskets / 14 days = 4 baskets per day.  Therefore, they collected 4 baskets of oranges per day.
Response:  We know that they collect 25 baskets of unripe oranges and 5 baskets of ripe oranges per day. If we assume that each basket contains 10 oranges (this is just an assumption), then in one day they collect:  25 x 10 = 250 unripe oranges  5 x 10 = 50 ripe oranges Now let's calculate how many days it will take to collect 73 baskets of unripe oranges. We can do this by dividing 73 by 25:  73 / 25 = 296 days So, it will take them 296 days to collect 73 baskets of unripe oranges. However, we are also given that they collect 5 baskets of ripe oranges per day. Therefore, if we subtract the number of days it takes to collect 73 baskets of unripe oranges from the total number of days, we get the number of days it will take to collect all the oranges:  296 - 25 = 271 days It will take them 271 days to collect all the oranges. Finally, we need to find out how many baskets of ripe oranges they will have after 73 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of baskets they collect per day by the number of days they will be collecting:  5 x 73 = 365 baskets After 73 days, they will have collected 365 baskets of ripe oranges.
Response:  We know that they collect 65 baskets of immature oranges and 46 baskets of ripe oranges per day. If we assume that each basket contains 10 oranges (this is just an assumption), then in one day they collect:  65 x 10 = 650 immature oranges  46 x 10 = 460 ripe oranges Total: 650 + 460 = 1110 oranges per day Now let's calculate how many immature oranges they will have after 6 days of collection:  650 x 6 = 3900 immature oranges So, after 6 days, they will have collected 3900 immature oranges.
Response:  We know that every day they collect 41 baskets of unripe oranges and 86 baskets of ripe oranges. To find out how many more baskets of ripe oranges are collected than unripe ones, we need to subtract the number of baskets of unripe oranges from the number of baskets of ripe oranges.   So, if we subtract 41 from 86, we get:  86 - 41 = 45 Therefore, they collect 45 more baskets of ripe oranges than unripe ones each day.
Response:  We know that every day they collect 71 baskets of unripe oranges and 60 baskets of ripe oranges. To find out how many more baskets of unripe oranges are collected each day, we need to subtract the number of baskets of ripe oranges from the number of baskets of unripe oranges.  71 - 60 =?  Yes, there are 11 more baskets of unripe oranges collected each day than baskets of ripe oranges.
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length.  12 - 11 =?  Yes, that's right! The room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug that is 14 square feet in size. Since her room has a length of 7 feet, we can find out how wide her room must be to fit such a rug.   To do this, let's divide the area of the rug (in square feet) by the length of the room (also in square feet): Area = Length x Width 14 sq ft = 7 ft x Width Width = 14 / 7 Width = 2 So, Jessie's room must be at least 2 feet wide to fit a rug that is 14 square feet in size.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug that is 14 square feet in size. Since the width of her room is given as 7 feet, we can find out how long the rug needs to be if we divide the area of the rug (in square feet) by the width of the room (also in square feet). So, we have:  14 sq ft / 7 ft =?  Now, let's simplify this fraction:  14 / 7 = 2 So, the length of Jessie's room must be 2 times 7 feet, or 14 feet!  Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 14 feet.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much of the room is already covered with the existing carpet. We know that the area of the carpet is 16 square feet (since it is given as ""16 sq ft""). Now, let's calculate the remaining area of the room that needs to be covered with new carpet. To do this, we subtract the area of the existing carpet from the total area of the room. The formula for the area of a rectangle is length x width. So, for the room, we have: Area = Length x Width = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet Since we are only interested in covering half of the room, we divide the total area by two: Half Area = Total Area / 2 = 165 / 2 = 82.5 square feet Therefore, Jessie needs an additional 82.5 square feet of carpet to cover the remaining half of the room."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the area of the room in square feet.  Area = Length x Width = 2 ft x 12 ft = 24 sq ft Now, let's divide the area by the size of each tile (4 sq ft) to find out how many tiles are needed: Number of tiles = Area / Size of tile = 24 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 6 tiles So, Jessie will need 6 tiles to cover half of her room with 4-square-foot tiles.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total area of all the rooms.  To do this, we multiply the length and width of each room.  Since there are 20 rooms, we can write an equation for the total area as follows:   Total Area = (19 x 18) + (19 x 18) +... + (19 x 18)  We have 20 terms in our equation because there are 20 rooms.  Now let's simplify the equation:   Total Area = 360 + 360 +... + 360  There are 20 identical terms in the equation, so we can simplify it further:   Total Area = 20 x 360  The total area of all the rooms is 7200 square feet.  Next, we need to find out how many rugs Jessie needs to cover the floors of all her rooms.  Let's assume that each rug covers an area of 9 square feet (a typical size for a small rug).  So, we can divide the total area by the area per rug to get the number of rugs needed:   Number of Rugs = Total Area / Area Per Rug  Number of Rugs = 7200 / 9  Number of Rugs = 800  Therefore, Jessie will need 800 rugs to cover the floors of all her rooms.
Response:  First, we need to convert both dimensions from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in one foot, so:   width = 19 x 12 = 228 inches length = 20 x 12 = 240 inches Now we can calculate the difference between the two lengths:  difference = length - width = 240 - 228 = 12 inches So, the room is longer than it is wide by 12 inches.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room. We also know that the length of her room is 5 feet. So, if we can find out the width of her room, we can calculate the area of the rug she needs. To do this, let's use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since we know the length and want to find the width, we can set up an equation using this formula:   Width = Area / Length  Now we can plug in the values we know:  Width = (10) / (5)  Simplifying, we get:  Width = 2  Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is 2 feet.  Now that we have found the width, we can easily calculate the area of the rug she needs:  Area = Width x Length  Area = 2 x 5  Area = 10  So, Jessie needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her 5-foot long room.
"Response:  We know that Jessie needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room. Since the width of her room is 2 feet, we can find out the length of her room using the formula for area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length of Jessie's room would be:  
Length = (Area / Width) = (10 sq ft / 2 ft) = 5 ft So, the length of Jessie's room is 5 feet."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many square feet of floor space Jessie has in her room. We know that she has 18 square feet of carpet and that the length of her room is 4 feet (4 x 2 = 8 square feet). So, the total area of the room is:  8 + 18 = 26 square feet. Now, let's calculate how much more carpet Jessie needs to cover the entire floor. To do this, we subtract the amount of carpet she already has from the total area of the room:  26 - 18 = 8 square feet. Therefore, Jessie needs an additional 8 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the cost of each football sold is $23.  If they sold $230 worth of footballs, we can calculate how many footballs were sold as follows:  230 / 23 = 10 (footballs)  So, they sold 10 footballs during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University.
Response:  We know that the total revenue of the store is $51 and they sold 3 football jerseys during the game. So we can calculate the price of each jersey as follows: Total Revenue = Price x Quantity Total Revenue = $51 = Price x 3 Now we can solve for the price of each jersey: Price = Total Revenue / Quantity Price = $51 / 3 Price = $17 Therefore, the cost of each football jersey is $17.
Response:  First, we know that they sold 95 football jerseys in total. Secondly, we are told that each football jersey costs $87. Therefore, to find out how much money they made from selling football jerseys, we can multiply the number of football jerseys they sold by the cost of each jersey:  95 x $87 = $8,295. So, they made $8,295 from selling football jerseys during both games.
"Response:  We know that the total number of football jerseys sold is 242.  We also know that they sold 115 during the Arkansas game. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  242 = 115 + x  where ""x"" represents the number of football jerseys sold during the Texas Tech University game. Now let's solve for ""x"". To do this, we subtract 115 from both sides of the equation:  242 - 115 = x - 115  127 = x   Therefore, they sold 127 football jerseys during the Texas Tech University game."
Response:  First, we know that they sold 89 football jerseys during the Arkansas game and each one cost $98. So, if we multiply 89 by $98, we get:  89 x $98 = $8,722.  Now, let's add this amount to the total amount they made from selling football jerseys during both games. We know that they sold 163 football jerseys in total (89 during the Arkansas game and 74 during the Texas Tech University game). If we multiply 163 by $98, we get:  163 x $98 = $15,794.  Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling football jerseys is:  $8,722 + $15,794 = $24,516.
Response:  First, we know that the revenue from selling football jerseys is $78 per shirt. Second, we know that they sold 186 football jerseys in total during both games. Third, we are asked to find out how much money they made from selling football jerseys during the game against Texas Tech University. To do this, we need to subtract the number of jerseys sold during the Arkansas game (172) from the total number of jerseys sold (186). So, the difference is:  186 - 172 = 14. Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling football jerseys during the game against Texas Tech University is:  14 x $78 = $1092.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money they made from selling football jerseys. We know that each football jersey costs $62, so if they sold 183 of them, then they made:  183 x $62 = $11,466  Next, we need to calculate how much money they made from selling t-shirts. We know that each t-shirt costs $99, so if they sold 31 of them, then they made:  31 x $99 = $3,099  Finally, we add up the total amount of money they made from both football jerseys and t-shirts:  $11,466 + $3,099 = $14,565
Response:  First, we know that each football costs $67 and each shirt costs $165. Next, we are told that they sold 74 footballs and 156 shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University. So, to calculate how much money they made from selling shirts, we can multiply the number of shirts sold (156) by the price of one shirt ($165):  156 x $165 = $25,840  Therefore, the store earned $25,840 from selling shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from football sales is $192 x 157 = $29,684 and the total revenue from shirt sales is $34 x 19 = $636. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  29,684 + 636 =?  Now let's simplify the equation:  30,320 =?  To find out how much each item costs, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of items sold:  30,320 / 157 = $192 per football and  30,320 / 19 = $34 per shirt.  Therefore, the football costs $192, and the shirt costs $34.
Response:  We know that the cost of each football is $86 and the cost of each jersey is $232.  During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University, they sold 254 footballs and 43 jerseys.  To find out how much more it costs for a jersey compared to a football, we need to subtract the cost of a football from the cost of a jersey.  232 - 86 =?  The difference is $146.  So, a jersey costs $146 more than a football.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money they would have made if they sold each football jersey for $51 (the original price).  130 x $51 = 6,430 dollars. Now let's subtract the amount of money they spent on the discount. 8 x 130 = 960 dollars. So, they would have made $6,430 - 960 = 5,470 dollars.
Response:  First, we know that each football costs $201 before the game and $217 during the game. So, if they sold 14 footballs, we can calculate how much money they made as follows:  14 x $201 = $2824 (before the game) + 14 x ($217 - $201) = $2824 + 14 x $16 (profit per football) = $2824 + $224 = $3048. Therefore, they made $3048 from selling footballs during the game.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from football sales is $60 and the profit per shirt is $10. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  60 = 10x Where x represents the number of shirts sold. Now we need to solve for x. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:  60/10 = x x = 6 Since there are 6 shirts sold, the magainze made $60 in revenue selling those 6 shirts at a profit of $10 each or $60 altogether.
Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling football shirts is $215 and we sold 5 of them. So, to find out the cost of one football shirt, let's divide the total revenue by the number of shirts sold:   $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt.
Response:  First, we know that each t-shirt costs $215 and they sold 64 of them, so the total revenue from t-shirts is:  64 x $215 = $13,760  Next, we know that each hoodie costs $5 and they sold 20 of them, so the total revenue from hoodies is:   20 x $5 = $100  Therefore, the total revenue from all merchandise is:  $13,760 + $100 = $13,860
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money they made from selling football jerseys. We know that they sold 158 football jerseys at $204 each, so:  158 x $204 = $31,992 They made $31,992 from selling football jerseys. Next, we need to calculate how much money they made from selling two hats. We know that they sold two hats at $76 each, so:  2 x $76 = $152 They made $152 from selling two hats. Therefore, the total amount of money they made is: $31,992 + $152 = $32,144
Response:  We know that the revenue from each football jersey is $240 and the revenue from each t-shirt is $210. So if we sell x football jerseys and y t-shirts, our total revenue will be:   Revenue = (x * $240) + (y * $210)  Now we are given that they sold 177 football jerseys and 23 t-shirts during the game. So we can substitute these values into the equation above to get:  Revenue = (177 * $240) + (23 * $210)  Simplifying this expression gives us:  Revenue = $43,680 + $493  Therefore, the total revenue for the game was $44,173.  To compare the price of the football jersey and the t-shirt, we need to divide the revenue from each item by its quantity:  Price of football jersey = Revenue / Quantity = $43,680 / 177 = $245 per jersey  Price of t-shirt = Revenue / Quantity = $493 / 23 = $21 per shirt  So the football jersey costs $245, while the t-shirt costs $21.
Response:  We know that the Razorback store sells football jerseys for $115 each and t-shirts for $25 each. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University, they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 football jerseys. To find out how much more the football jersey costs than the t-shirt, we need to subtract the cost of the t-shirt from the cost of the football jersey.   Cost of football jersey - Cost of t-shirt = $115 - $25 = $90 So, the football jersey costs $90 more than the t-shirt.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then they have a total of 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. Since there are no tables without chairs, we can conclude that they have exactly 50 chairs. Therefore, the number of chairs is equal to the number of tables times the number of chairs in each table, which is 5 x 10 = 50.   So, they have 50 chairs more than tables.
Response:  We know that there are 2 sets of tables with the same number of chairs. So, if one table has x chairs, the other table also has x chairs. In total, they have 2x chairs. Since there are 12 chairs in the backyard, we can set up the equation:  2x = 12. Solving for x, we get:  x = 6. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 9 stools in total in the backyard. Since each set of tables has 3 chairs, we can start by dividing 9 by 3 to find out how many sets of tables they have:  9 / 3 =?  Can you solve this division problem and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs. So, in total, there are 11 x 13 = 143 chairs. Since each chair is meant for one person, we can conclude that there will be 143 people at the party.
Response:  We know that there are 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each, for a total of  10 x 6 = 60 chairs.  If 11 people are sitting at the tables, then we can subtract the number of occupied chairs from the total number of chairs to find out how many chairs remain unoccupied:  60 - 11 = 49.  Therefore, 49 chairs remain unoccupied.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 sets of tables with 14 chairs each, so the total number of chairs is:  12 x 14 = 168 chairs Now, we have 6 extra chairs, so the total number of seats for guests is:  168 + 6 = 174 seats
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 sets of tables with 3 chairs each. So, in total, they have  4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Now, if 14 people come to the party, how many more chairs do they need? To find out, subtract the number of chairs they already have from the total number of people coming to the party:  14 - 12 = 2. Therefore, they need 2 more chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 9 sets of tables (on each set - 14 chairs). So, in total, there will be 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. But we need to count how many more chairs than tables. To do this, subtract the number of tables from the total number of chairs:  126 - 9 = 117. Therefore, there will be 117 chairs more than tables.
Response:  We know that Lewis earned $460 in total for 5 weeks of harvesting. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide the total amount by the number of weeks:  460 / 5 = 92 dollars per week.
Response:  First, we know that Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest season. Secondly, we are given that he earns $16 per week. So, to find out how many weeks the harvest season lasted, we can divide the total amount of money he earned by his weekly wage:  1216 / 16 =? Weeks  The result is: 1216 / 16 = 76 weeks  Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 76 weeks or approximately 18 months (assuming 4 weeks in a month).
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lewis earns per week during the harvest season. We know that he earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, so let's multiply these numbers together to get his total earnings for the season:  
$21 x 216 = $4592  
Now, we know that Lewis has to pay $702 in taxes. So, if we subtract this amount from his total earnings, we can find out how much money he will have left at the end of the season:  
$4592 - $702 = $3890  
Therefore, Lewis will have $3890 left after paying his taxes at the end of the harvest season."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lewis will earn in one season:  
$1357 x 22 = $29,644 per season. Now let's calculate how much he will earn in 73 seasons:  
$29,644 x 73 = $2,180,920."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lewis earns during the harvest season if he works overtime every week. We know that he earns $28 per week for 1091 weeks (or 1091 x $28 = $30,568). Additionally, we know that he earns $939 per week from overtime work. So, the total amount of money Lewis earns during the harvest season is:   $30,568 + $939 = $31,477.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lewis earns per week during the harvest season. We know that he earns $403 per week and works for 233 weeks (or 52 x 4.5 months). So, his total earnings for the season are:  403 x 233 = $91,699. Next, we subtract the amount he pays in rent each week ($49) from his total earnings to find out how much he has left after paying rent:  91,699 - 49 x 233 = $91,699 - $11,377 = $80,322. Therefore, Lewis earns $80,322 during the harvest season after paying $11,377 in rent.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many weeks (not days) Lewis will be renting the land for. We know that he rents the land for 1359 weeks (or 27 years). Next, we need to calculate how much he pays per week in rent. The problem states that he pays $388 per week in rent. Therefore, to find out how much he pays for rent during the harvest season, we multiply the number of weeks he rents the land by his weekly rent amount:  388 x 1359 = $$504,324$$ This is the total amount Lewis will pay for rent during the harvest season.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lewis earns per week after deducting his rent from his income. We can do this by subtracting $216 (the amount of rent he pays each week) from $491 (his weekly income):  
$491 - $216 = $275  
So, Lewis has $275 left after paying his rent each week. Now, let's calculate how much money he will have at the end of the season if he works for 1181 weeks (which is equivalent to 23 years). To do this, we can multiply the number of weeks he works by the amount he has left after paying his rent:  
$275 x 1181 = $323,875  
Therefore, Lewis will have $323,875 at the end of the season after working for 23 years and earning $491 per week."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $133 in total over 19 weeks. So we can calculate his weekly earnings as follows:   Total earnings = $133 Weekly earnings = Total earnings / Number of weeks  Weekly earnings = $133 / 19  Simplifying, we get:  Weekly earnings = $7 per week
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $2 per week during the harvest season. So, if he earned a total of $178, we can calculate how many weeks he worked as follows:  178 dollars / 2 dollars per week = 89 weeks  Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 89 weeks or approximately 20 months.
Response:  First, we know that the depth of water is 10 times greater than Dino's height, so if Dino is 9 feet tall, then the depth of water would be 9 x 10 = 90 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Ron is 14 feet tall and Din is 8 feet shorter than Ron. So, Din is 6 feet (14 - 8) = 6 feet tall. Now, we are told that the depth of water is twice the height of Din. Therefore, the depth of water is 2 x 6 = 12 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Ron is 12 feet tall and Dinn is 11 feet shorter than him. So, Dinn is 12 - 11 = 1 foot taller than Ron.   Now, we are told that the depth of the water is 5 times greater than the height of Dinn. So, if Dinn is x feet tall, then the depth of the water is 5x feet.  We also know that the depth of the water is less than or equal to the height of Ron plus Dinn's height. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  5x <= 12 + 1 = 13 feet  Simplifying the equation, we get:  5x <= 13  Divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:  x >= 2 6  Since x is a whole number, we know that Dinn is at least 26 feet tall.  Therefore, the depth of the water is at least 5 times Dinn's height, which is 5 x 26 = 130 feet.  The water is at least 130 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that Ron is 13 feet tall and Dino is 4 feet taller than him. So, Dino is 17 feet (13 + 4) tall.   Now, we are told that after they went swimming, the water was 15 times deeper than Dinosaur's height. This means that if Dinosaur's height is x feet, then the water depth would be 15x feet deep.  Since Dino is 17 feet tall, the water depth would be 15(17) = 255 feet deep.
Response:  First, we know that DIN is 9 feet higher than RON, so if RON stands at 13 feet, then DIN stands at 13 + 9 = 22 feet.   Next, we are told that the depth of water is 16 times greater than RON's height, so the depth of water would be 16 x 22 = 352 feet.
Response:  First, we know that Ron is 15 feet tall and DIn is 6 feet shorter than Ron, so DIn is 9 feet (6 x 2) shorter than Ron.   Second, we are told that the depth of water is 9 times greater than Din's height, so if Din's height is x feet, then the depth of water is 9x feet.  Now we can set up an equation using the information we have:  We know that Ron is 15 feet tall, so his height is 15 feet.  Since DIn is 6 feet shorter than Ron, his height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet.  The depth of water is 9 times greater than DIn's height, so the depth of water is 9(9) = 81 feet.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and they are equally distributed between two bookshelves, then each bookshelf will have half of the total number of books, which is 34/2 = 17 books per bookshelf.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each book takes up two shelves, then he needs at least 42/2 = 21 shelves to store all his books.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 23 bookshelves and each shelf contains 80 journals. So, the total number of journals is 23 x 80 = 1840. Now, we need to find out how many books Brian has. We are given that he has 27 books, but we don't know which ones they are or where they are located. However, since each shelf contains 80 journals, it means that there are 80 - 27 = 53 empty slots on each shelf. Therefore, the total number of books is 53 x 23 = 1299. So, Brian has 1299 books in addition to the 27 he already owns.
Response:  Brian has 10 bookshelves with 46 journals each, so he has 46 x 10 = 460 journals in total.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 29 bookshelves, and each shelf contains 61 journals. So, the total number of journals is:  29 x 61 = 1791 journals. Now, let's find out how many books Brian has. We know that he has 23 books, so we can simply add them up to get the total number of books:  23 + 23 +... + 23 (since he has 23 books on each shelf) = 23 x 29 = 647 books. Therefore, in total, Brian has 1791 journals and 647 books.
Response:  We know that Brian has 28 books in total and each bookshelf has an equal number of books. So, if we divide 28 by the number of bookshelves (which is 7), we can find out how many books are on each shelf.  28 / 7 =?  The result is 4. Therefore, there are 4 books on each bookshelf.
Response:  Brian has 38 books in total. Since each bookshelf contains 2 books, he needs at least 38/2 = 19 bookshelves to store all his books.
Response:  Carol has 10 friends and needs to send invitations to each of them. Since there are 2 invitations in each package she bought, we can calculate how many packages she will need as follows:  10 (friends) / 2 (invitations per package) = 5 packages  So, Carol will need 5 packages of invitations to ensure that every friend gets one.
Response:  Carol has 12 friends and she bought 3 packages of invitations. Since each package contains the same number of invitations, we can say that each package contains 12/3 = 4 invitations.   Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  Carol has 7 packages of invitations, and each package contains 10 invitations. Therefore, she has a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. If she sends 2 invitations to her friends, then she will have used up 2 + 2 = 4 invitations. So, the number of invitations remaining with Carol is 70 - 4 = 66.
Response:  Carol has 14 invitations in each package she bought, and she bought 6 packages, so she has a total of  14 x 6 = 84 invitations.  She also bought 11 additional invitations, so now she has a total of  84 + 11 = 95 invitations.  Therefore, Carol can invite 95 friends to her birthday party.
Response:  Carol has 2 packs of invitations with 3 invitations each, so she has a total of 6 invitations. She wants to invite 9 friends, so she needs an additional  3 invitations (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, Carol needs to buy 1 more pack of invitations.
Response:  Melissa scored 12 points in each game, so she scored a total of  12 x 2 = 24 points in two games. Since she only scored 36 points in total, we know that she played two games.  Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Melissa played three games and scored a total of 81 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each game, we can set up an equation based on this information.   Equation 1: Total Points = Points per Game x Number of Games  Equation 2: Points per Game = Total Points / Number of Games  Now let's substitute the values we know into Equation 2:  Points per Game = 81 / 3  Points per Game = 27  So, Melissa scored 27 points in each game.
"Response:  First, we know that Melissa scored 109 points in each game, so if she played 79 games, her total score would be:  
109 x 79 = 8603  Next, we know that she received 82 bonus points in each game, so her total score including bonuses would be:  
8603 + 82 x 79 = 8603 + 6452 = 15055  Therefore, Melissa scored a total of 15055 points in 79 games."
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored in total 21 points and she scored 7 points in each game. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  21 = 7 x Games Played  Now we need to solve for ""Games Played"" (let's call it ""g"") :  21 = 7g  To isolate g, divide both sides of the equation by 7:  3 = g  Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 91 points in total and played 13 games. So each game she scored 7 points (91/13).   Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in every game.
Response:  We know that there are 4 places in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride it simultaneously. So we need to find out how many people each place can accommodate. To do this, let's divide 20 by 4:  20 / 4 = 5 Therefore, each place in the Ferris wheel can accommodate 5 people.
Response:  If each place can accommodate 9 people and there are 18 people who want to ride at once, then we need to find out how many groups of 9 people we can have.   We know that 9 x 2 = 18 (since each group of 9 people will take up two places). So, we can have 18/2 = 9 groups of 9 people each. Therefore, there are 9 x 9 = 81 places in total for the Ferris wheel.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many people can fit in one carousel ride. We know that each carousel has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can fit in one carousel ride is:  19 x 15 = 285 people. Now let's calculate how many people can ride simultaneously on all 20 carousels. We know that there are 20 carousels in total, so if we multiply the number of people who can fit in one carousel ride by the number of carousels, we get:  285 x 20 = 5700 people. So, at any given time, up to 5700 people can be riding the carousels in the park.
Response:  If there are 18 places in total and each place can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 18 x 15 = 270 people.  Now, if 10 places (or seats) are broken, that means 10 x 15 = 150 people cannot ride at once.  So, the current capacity of the Ferris wheel after 10 seats are broken is 270 - 150 = 120 people.
Response:  We know that there are 6 places in the Ferris wheel and each place can accommodate 14 people. So, if there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel, we can calculate how many more people can join as follows:  16 (current number of people) x 6 (number of places) = 96 (total capacity of the Ferris wheel) - 16 (current number of people) = 80 (remaining capacity) Therefore, up to 80 more people can join the Ferris wheel.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many small places are available in total. We know that there are 2 small places and each can accommodate 14 people. So, the total number of people who can sit in small places is:  2 x 14 = 28 people. Now, let's calculate the total capacity of all small places: Total Capacity of Small Places = Number of Small Places x Maximum Number of People per Place Total Capacity of Small Places = 2 x 14 = 28 people. Next, we need to find out how many big places are available in total. We know that there are 23 big places and each can accommodate 54 people. So, the total number of people who can sit in big places is:  23 x 54 = 1232 people. Now, let's calculate the total capacity of all big places: Total Capacity of Big Places = Number of Big Places x Maximum Number of People per Place Total Capacity of Big Places = 23 x 54 = 1232 people. Finally, we add up the total capacities of both small and big places to get the total capacity of the entire Ferris wheel: Total Capacity of Ferris Wheel = Total Capacity of Small Places + Total Capacity of Big Places Total Capacity of Ferris Wheel = 28 + 1232 = 1260 people. Therefore, a maximum of 1260 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once, assuming all small places are occupied and some big places are also occupied.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 big places and each can accommodate 12 people. So we multiply 7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit in the big places. In total, we have 84 + (3 x 16) = 84 + 48 = 132 people who can ride the Ferris wheel.  

Question: How many small places are available for riding the Ferris wheel? Answer: There are 3 small places available for riding the Ferris wheel. Each place can accommodate 16 people, so there are 3 x 16 = 48 people who can ride in the small places."
Response:  We know that there are 4 places on each car of the Ferris wheel and we want to find out how many people can fit in each place. Since each car has 4 places, we can start by dividing 16 (the total number of people who can ride at once) by 4 (the number of places per car).  16 ÷ 4 = 4 So, each car can accommodate 4 people. Therefore, if there are 4 cars on the Ferris wheel, a total of 4 x 4 = 16 people can ride at once.
Response:  We know that there are 4 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once, and each seat can accommodate 2 people. Therefore, we need to divide 4 (the number of riders) by 2 (the number of people per seat): 4 ÷ 2 = 2 So, there are 2 seats on the Ferris wheel.
Response:  We know that there are 14 cu...
Response:  We know that each pizza has 2 slices and we have 28 slices in total. So, to find out how many pizzas we ordered, we can divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:  28 / 2 = 14  Therefore, we ordered 14 pizzas.
Response:  We have 17 pizzas with 4 slices each. So we have in total:  17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. Now, if there are 25 people eating the pizza, each person will get:  68 / 25 = 2.72 slices of pizza. Since we can't divide pizza into fractional slices, each person will get 2 whole slices of pizza. Therefore, the total number of cups of pizza is:  25 x 2 = 50 cups of pizza.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas with 10 pieces each, so in total we have  9 x 10 = 90 pieces of pizza. If there are two of us, and we want to divide the pizza equally between us, then each person will get half of the total number of pieces, which is:  90 / 2 = 45 pieces of pizza.
Response:  We know that Peyage and her mom planted seeds in 45 flowerpots (clubs). They put 10 seeds in each pot. So we can calculate how many seeds they planted as follows:  45 x 10 = 450 seeds  Therefore, Peyage and her mom planted 450 seeds.
"Response:  We know that Peyage and her mom planted 45 seeds in total.  They planted the same number of seeds in each flowerbed (since they put the same amount of seeds in every club). Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  45 = 9 x S Where ""S"" is the number of seeds per flowerbed. Now let's solve for ""S"":  45 / 9 = S So, S = 5 Since there are 9 clubs, and each club has 5 seeds, the correct answer is 5."
Response:  We know that Peyage and her mom planted 36 seeds in total. They put 12 seeds in each of their flower beds (clumba). So, we can start with this equation:  36 = 12 x...  Since only 58 flowers grew in each clumb, let's substitute that into our equation:  36 = 12 x 58  Now we can simplify:  36 = 12 x 58  Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the fraction:  432 = 696  Subtract 264 from both sides:  176 = 432  Divide both sides by 12:  14 = 36  Therefore, they had 14 clumbs.
Response:  First, we know that Peyage and her mom planted 55 seeds in total.  Second, they put 15 seeds in each of their two flowerbeds (clubs).  Third, only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in each club.  So, if we multiply 2 clubs x 60 flowers per club, we get...  2 x 60 = 120 flowers!  That means Peyage and her mom grew 120 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that Peyage and her mom planted a total of 60 seeds. Since each club can hold up to 10 seeds, we can divide 60 by 10 to find out how many clubs they had:  60 / 10 = 6 So, Peyage and her mom had 6 clubs in total.
Response:  We know that Peyage and her mom planted 32 seeds in total. They planted them in 8 clubbs. So, if they had planted the same number of seeds in each clubb, we can set up the following equation:  32 = 8 x n  Where n is the number of seeds in each clubb.  Solving for n, we get:  n = 32 / 8  n = 4  Therefore, Peyage and her mom planted 4 seeds in each clubb.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 crackers, then he gave a total of 11 x 2 = 22 crackers away. So, if we subtract the number of crackers given away from the original amount, we get:  22 - 22 = 0 crackers left for Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 crackers and gave 2 to each of his friends, then he would have given out a total of  8 x 2 = 16 crackers. So, there were 16 friends who received crackers from Matthew.
Response:  Firstly, Methy had 15 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to his 5 friends. So, he gave  5 x 15 = 75 crackers in total. Now, let's find out how many crackers each friend got. Since there are 5 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers among them equally: 75 / 5 = 15 crackers per friend. Therefore, each friend ate 15 crackers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew had 24 crackers and he gave an equal number of crackers to his three friends. So, if we divide 24 by 3, we get:  24 / 3 = 8  Therefore, Matthew gave each of his three friends 8 crackers. Now, let's find out how many crackers Matthew has left. We are told that after giving crackers to his friends, Matthew had 17 crackers left. So, we can subtract 8 from 24 to find out how many crackers Matthew had before giving them away:  24 - 8 = 16  Since Matthew had 16 crackers left after giving 8 crackers to each of his three friends, the correct answer is:  8
Response:  First, we know that Methuselah had 22 crackers and 34 pies. Next, we are told that he gave an equal number of crackers and pies to his 11 friends. So, if we divide both numbers equally among 11 people, each person will get:  22 / 11 = 2 crackers per person  34 / 11 = 3 pies per person  Therefore, each person ate 2 crackers and 3 pies.
"Response:  Firstly, Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and pastries to his two friends. Therefore, if he had 29 crackers and 30 pastries in total, then each friend received half of that amount.  
Crackers: 29 / 2 = 14 (each friend) Pastries: 30 / 2 = 15 (each friend) So, each person ate 14 crackers and 15 pastries."
Response:  First, we know that Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies in total. Next, we are told that he gave an equal number of crackers and cookies to his 7 friends. So, if we divide both numbers equally among 7 people, each person will get:  14 / 7 = 2 crackers  21 / 7 = 3 cookies Therefore, each person will eat 2 crackers and 3 cookies.
"Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to his 18 friends, then each friend received:  

Matthew had 36 crackers in total:  

So, each friend received:  

Therefore, each person ate 2 crackers."
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 6 pieces of pecheny, and he had 36 pieces in total, then we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  36 = 6 x (number of friends)  To solve for the number of friends, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:  6 = (number of friends) x 36  Now, we can see that there are 6 times as many friends as there are pieces of pecheny. So, if there were 36 pieces of pecheny, then there would be 6 x 36 = 216 friends.
Response:  Matthew had 23 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to his two friends. So, he has 23 - (2 x some number) = 23 - 2x, where x is the number of crackers each friend received. Since there are only 11 crackers left for Matthew, we can set up the equation as follows:  23 - 2x = 11. Simplifying the equation, we get:  2x = 12. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:   x = 6. Therefore, each friend received 6 crackers from Matthew.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Matthew had 31 crackers and he gave an equal number of crackers to his 5 friends. So, if we divide 31 by 5, we get:  31 / 5 = 6   Therefore, Matthew gave each of his 5 friends 6 crackers.
Response:  Firstly, Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and pies to his 4 friends. So, if he had x crackers left, he would have given (x/4) crackers to each friend. Now, let's calculate how many crackers each friend got:   Friend 1: (x/4) Friend 2: (x/4) Friend 3: (x/4) Friend 4: (x/4) Since there are 4 friends in total, we can add up the number of crackers they received: Total = (x/4) + (x/4) + (x/4) + (x/4) Simplifying the equation: Total = 4(x/4) Total = x Now, we know that Matthew started with 32 crackers, so: x = 32 Therefore, each friend got: Friend 1: 32/4 = 8 crackers Friend 2: 32/4 = 8 crackers Friend 3: 32/4 = 8 crackers Friend 4: 32/4 = 8 crackers
Response:  Firstly, Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and pies to his 4 friends. So, if he had 10 crackers and 8 pies, he would have given  2 each (10/2 = 5 crackers and 8/2 = 4 pies). Therefore, each friend received 5 crackers and 4 pies.
Response:  Firstly, Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. So, if he had x crackers and y cakes initially, he would have given (x/28) crackers and (y/28) cakes to each friend. Now, let's find out how many crackers and cakes were left with Matthew after giving them away. We know that he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. So, after giving them away, he would have (13/28) crackers and (15/28) cakes left. Finally, we can solve for x and y using these equations:  13 = (x/28) + (x/28) (for crackers)  15 = (y/28) + (y/28) (for cakes) Solving simultaneously, we get: x = 42 and y = 70 Therefore, there were 42 crackers and 70 cakes in total.
Response:  We know that Debbi drank 109 bottles per day and there were enough bottles for 74 days. So we can start with this equation:  109 x = 74. Now let's divide both sides of the equation by 109 to solve for x (the number of bottles):  x = 74 / 109. Simplifying, we get:  x = 68. Therefore, Debbi bought 68 bottles of water.
"Response:  We know that Debbi bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale, and she drank an equal amount of bottles every day for 17 days. So we can start by setting up an equation to represent this information:  153 = (x) x 17 where ""x"" represents the number of bottles Debbi drank each day. Now let's solve for ""x"". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 17:  153 / 17 = x x 17 9 = x  So, Debbi drank 9 bottles of water each day."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby bought in total:  264 x 10 = 2640 (since there are 10 bottles in a case) Now, let's calculate how many bottles she drank during 11 days:  15 x 11 = 165 (since she drinks 15 bottles per day) So, how many bottles does she have left?  2640 - 165 = 2475 (subtracting the number of bottles she drank from the total number of bottles she bought) Therefore, Debby has 2475 bottles of water left.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby drank in total. We know that she drank 144 bottles per day for several days. So, if we multiply 144 by the number of days she drank water, we get:  144 x (number of days) = Total amount of water consumed  Since Debby bought 301 bottles when they were on sale, and each bottle contains 500 ml of water, we can calculate the total amount of water she consumed as follows:  301 x 500 = Total amount of water consumed  Now, let's solve for the number of days she drank water. We know that the total amount of water consumed is equal to the number of days she drank water multiplied by the daily amount of water consumed:  Total amount of water consumed = Number of days x Daily amount of water consumed  Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  Total amount of water consumed = (Number of days) x (Daily amount of water consumed)  Substituting the values, we get:  (Number of days) x 144 = Total amount of water consumed  Solving for the number of days, we get:  Number of days = Total amount of water consumed / Daily amount of water consumed  Substituting the values, we get:  Number of days = 2100 / 144  Simplifying, we get:  Number of days = 14  Therefore, Debby drank water for 14 days before running out of supply.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby has in total. We know that she bought 88 bottles of water at a discounted price. Next, we need to calculate how many days it will last for her to drink 4 bottles of water per day. To do this, we divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles consumed per day:  88 bottles / 4 bottles/day = 22 days So, Debby has enough water for 22 days if she consumes 4 bottles per day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby has in total:  200 + 256 = 456 bottles. Next, let's calculate how much water she drinks per day:  312 bottles. Now, let's subtract how much water she drinks from her total amount of water:  456 - 312 = 144 bottles. Finally, let's divide the remaining amount of water by the number of bottles she drinks per day to find out how many days it will last:  144 / 312 = 4 days. So, Debby has enough gasoline for 4 days.
Response:  We know that Debbi drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she has bought 12 bottles in total. So, if we divide the number of bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day, we can find out how many days her supply will last:  12 / 6 = 2 Therefore, Debbi's supply of water will last for 2 days.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby has in total. We know that she bought 180 bottles of water at a discounted price. Next, we need to find out how much water Debby drinks in one day. The problem states that she drinks 15 bottles of water per day. Now, let's subtract the number of bottles of water Debby drinks in one day from the total number of bottles of water she has to find out how many days her supply of water will last.  180 - 15 =?  Yes, that's right! Debby has enough water for 165 days (180 - 15).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many bottles of water Debby has left after drinking 122 bottles.  122 - 162 = 40 bottles of water are left. Now let's calculate how many days this amount of gas will last.  We know that she drinks 9 bottles of soda per day, so we can divide the number of bottles of soda left (360) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (9): 360 / 9 = 40 days. Therefore, Debby has enough gas for 40 days.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many rows of crayons Fey has. We know that she has 14 rows and each row contains 11 crayons. So, if we multiply 14 by 11, we get:  14 x 11 = 154 Therefore, Fey has 154 crayons in total.
Response:  We know that Fey placed 12 caranfils (carandaches) evenly in 3 rows. So we can start by dividing 12 by 3 to find out how many carandaches are in each row:  12 / 3 = 4 Now we know that Fey has 4 carandaches in each row.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 28 packs of colored pencils, and each pack contains 24 colored pencils. So she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 colored pencils.   Next, we know that Fey places her colored pencils in rows of 16 pencils per row. So if we divide 672 by 16, we get:  672 / 16 = 41 rows. Therefore, Fey can make 41 rows of colored pencils using all of her supplies.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 6 packs of colored pencils.  Second, each pack contains 14 colored pencils.  Third, she places her colored pencils in rows with 22 colored pencils in each row.  To find out how many colored pencils Fey has in total, let's multiply the number of packs (6) by the number of colored pencils in each pack (14):  6 x 14 = 84  Therefore, Fey has 84 colored pencils in total.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 35 total caran dishes and 7 colored ones.  So, if she places them in rows of 5 each, how many rows can she make?   To find out, let's divide 35 by 5: 35 / 5 = 7  Therefore, Fey can make 7 rows of 5 caran dishes each.  But wait! We also know that there are 7 colored caran dishes. If she places these in separate rows, how many rows can she make with just the colored ones?  Again, let's divide by 5: 7 / 5 = 1  And so, Fey can make 1 row of 5 colored caran dishes.  Now, let's add up all the rows: 7 (rows of regular caran dishes) + 1 (row of colored caran dishes) = 8 rows in total.  So, Fey can make 8 rows of caran dishes.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 19 rows of crayons and each row contains 4 big crayons and 27 small crayons. So, let's start by finding out how many big crayons she has in total.   Big crayons: 19 rows x 4 big crayons per row = 76 big crayons Total number of big crayons = 76 Now, let's find out how many small crayons she has. Small crayons: 19 rows x 27 small crayons per row = 353 small crayons Total number of small crayons = 353 Therefore, Fey has a total of 76 big crayons and 353 small crayons.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 7 rows of crayons.  Second, each row contains 36 crayons except for the last one which contains 30 crayons.  So, if we multiply the number of rows by the number of crayons in each row, we get:  7 x 36 = 252 + 7 x 30 = 210 = 462 crayons.  Therefore, Fey has 462 crayons in total.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many rows of carandashes Fey has in total. We know that she has 11 rows and each row contains 31 carandashes, so:  11 x 31 = 341  Now, let's calculate how many carandashes Fey has in total. We know that she has 27 carandashes in each row, so:  341 x 27 = 9177  Therefore, Fey has 9177 carandashes in total.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 30 caran dhas in total.  Second, each row contains 5 caran dhas. So, if we divide 30 by 5, we get:  30 / 5 = 6  This means that Fey can make 6 rows of 5 caran dhas each.
Response:  If Fey had 6 caran dishes and placed them equally in two rows, then each row would have half of 6, which is 3. So Fey placed 3 carandishes in each row.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 35 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 4 pencils. So she has a total of  35 x 4 = 140 pencils.  Next, we know that she wants to arrange her pencils in rows of 2 pencils per row. So let's divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per row:  140 / 2 = 70 rows.  Therefore, Fey can make 70 rows of 2 pencils per row using all her pencils.
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 31 pack of pencils, and each pack contains 6 pencils. So she has a total of  31 x 6 = 186 pencils. Next, we are told that she puts her pencils in rows of 19 pencils each. Therefore, she can put her pencils in  186 / 19 = 10 rows. Finally, we need to find out how many pencils she has left after putting them in rows. Since each row contains 19 pencils, she has  186 - (10 x 19) = 186 - 190 = 6 pencils left over. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many rows of colored pencils Fey has:  30 rows x 71 colored pencils per row =?  Next, we need to calculate how many colored pencils she has in total:? x 24 plain pencils per row =?  Finally, we can add up all these calculations to get our final answer:? +? =?  Can you fill in the missing numbers and give me your answer?
Response:  First, we know that Fey has 16 rows of crayons and each row contains 6 colorful crayons and 21 ordinary crayons. So, let's start with the number of rows she has:  16 rows x 6 colorful crayons per row =?  Now, let's calculate the total number of colorful crayons:  16 rows x 6 colorful crayons per row = 96 colorful crayons.  Finally, let's find out how many ordinary crayons Fey has:  16 rows x 21 ordinary crayons per row = 320 ordinary crayons.  Therefore, Fey has 96 colorful crayons and 320 ordinary crayons in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 school buses and each bus can carry x passengers. Since all buses will be fully loaded, we need to find out how many students each bus can accommodate.   To do this, let's divide the total number of students (98) by the number of buses (7): 98 / 7 = x  Therefore, each bus can carry 14 students (since 98 ÷ 7 = 14).
Response:  We know that there are 95 school buses and each bus can seat 118 students. So, we can calculate the total number of seats as follows:   Total seats = Number of buses x Seating capacity per bus  Total seats = 95 x 118  Total seats = 10,720  Now, we need to find out how many students can fit in these seats. Since each class has an average of 30 students, we can estimate the total number of students as follows:  Total students = Total seats / Average number of students per class  Total students = 10,720 / 30  Total students = 356 classes  Therefore, there are approximately 356 classes with 30 students in each class, for a total of around 10,500 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many students will be going on the excursion in total. Since there are 67 classes and each class has 66 students, the total number of students is:  67 x 66 = 4322 students. Next, we need to determine how many students can fit in one bus. We know that each bus has 6 seats, so we divide the total number of students by 6 to find out how many buses are needed:  4322 / 6 = 720 buses. Therefore, 720 buses will be required for the school trip.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many students will be in each bus if there are 2 seats per student.  Secondly, we can use division to find out how many buses are needed based on the total number of students and the capacity of each bus.  1) Calculate the total number of students: Total = (Number of classes x Number of students per class) + (Number of classes x Number of students per class) +... + (Number of classes x Number of students per class)  Since there are 87 classes and 58 students per class, the total number of students is: Total = (87 x 58) = 4963 2) Calculate the total number of seats required: Seats = (Total x 2) = (4963 x 2) = 9926 seats  Now that we have the total number of seats required, we can divide it by the capacity of each bus (2 seats per student): Buses = (9926 / 2) = 4963 buses  Therefore, we need 4963 buses for the school trip.
Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. So we can start by dividing 120 by the number of classes:  120 / 24 =?  Now we need to find out how many students are in each class. To do this, we divide the result from the previous calculation by the number of students per class (which is given as 84):  120 / 24 = 84 / x, where x is the number of students in each class.  Simplifying, we get:  3 = x  Therefore, there are 3 students in each class.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many students will go on the excursion if all classes participate. We know that there are 66 classes and each class has 8 students who want to go on the excursion. So, the total number of students who want to go is:  66 x 8 = 528 students.  Now let's subtract the number of students who do not want to go (22) from the total number of students who want to go:  528 - 22 = 506 students.  Next, we need to calculate how many buses we need based on the number of students who will be going on the excursion. Since each bus can accommodate 8 students, we divide the total number of students by 8 to get the number of buses needed:  506 / 8 = 63 buses.  Therefore, we need 63 buses for the school trip.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many students will not go on the excursion if 8 students do not want to participate.  8 students x 102 classes = 816 students will not go on the excursion. Now let's calculate how many students can fit in each bus. There are 99 seats in each bus and 11 students per class (since there are 11 students who want to go on the excursion). So, 99 seats / 11 students per class = 9 seats per class. Since there are 102 classes, that means there are 9 x 102 = 918 seats available for the excursion. Finally, add the number of students who will not go on the excursion (816) to the number of seats available (918), and you get a total of 1734 students who can go on the excursion.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in total and each class has 3 students. So, the total number of students is:  72 x 3 = 216  Now we need to find out how many buses will be needed for the trip if there are 111 students in total. To do this, we can divide the total number of students (216) by the number of seats per bus (3):  216 / 3 = 72  Therefore, we need 72 buses for the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 46 autobuses and 92 students. If all buses were filled to capacity, how many students would be in each bus?   To find out, we need to divide the total number of students (92) by the number of buses (46): 92 / 46 = 2 Now we know that if all buses were filled to capacity, each bus would have 2 students.
Response:  If Hayley gives each boy 9 marbles, then she has given out a total of  9 x 11 = 99 marbles.  So, Hayley had 99 - 99 = 0 marbles left after giving them away.
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and gives each of 5 boys 5 marbles, then she will have  10 - (5 x 5) = 10 - 25 = 0 marbles left. Therefore, there are 5 boys who received marbles.
Response:  If Hayley has 23 marbles and wants to leave herself with 15, that means she needs to give away  8 marbles (23 - 15 = 8).  Since there are four boys playing, each boy will receive an equal number of marbles. So, if we divide 8 among them equally, each boy will get  8/4 = 2 marbles.
Response:  We know that there are 13 boys who like to play with marbles and each boy will receive some marbles. Since there are 26 marbles in total, we can divide them among the 13 boys as follows:  13 x 2 = 26 (since each boy gets twice as many marbles) So each boy will get 2 marbles.
Response:  If Hayley has 20 glass balls and there are two boys who love playing with them, we can assume that each boy will receive half of the total number of balls, which is 10.   So, each boy will get 10 glass balls.
Response:  If Haley has 28 marbles and gives each boy two marbles, then she will have 28 - 2 \* x = 0, where x is the number of boys who received marbles.   Since Haley gave out all her marbles, we know that 28 - 2x = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, there were 14 boys who received marbles from Haley.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many days it would take Frank to read the entire book if he reads at a constant rate of 14 pages per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages in the book (392) by the number of pages Frank reads per day (14):  392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days So, it would take Frank 28 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads at a constant rate of 14 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank read his favorite book for 569 days. Secondly, he read 22 pages per day. So, to find out how many pages are in the book, we can divide the total number of days by the number of pages per day.  569 days / 22 pages/day =?  Now, let's simplify the calculation. 569 / 22 = 25. To find the final answer, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 2500 pages in Frank's favorite book.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 612 pages in total and 24 chapters. So each chapter has approximately 25 pages (612 / 24 = 25). Now, we know that Frank took 6 days to finish the book, so he must have read one chapter per day. Therefore, the number of pages Frank reads per day is equal to the number of pages in one chapter, which is 25 pages.   Finally, we can calculate how many pages Frank reads in one day as follows: Number of pages Frank reads per day = Number of pages in one chapter x Number of chapters per day = 25 x 1 = 25 pages per day.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 555 pages in total and Frank took 220 days to finish reading the book. This means he spent 220/5 = 44 days reading each of the five chapters. Now, since each chapter has an equal number of pages, we can set up the following equation:  5 x (pages per day) = 44 We solve for ""pages per day"" as follows:  5 x (pages per day) = 44 pages per day  Divide both sides by 5:   pages per day = 8.8 pages per day  Since each page is divided into 5 sections, we have:  1 page = 8.8 / 5 = 1.76 sections per page Therefore, the number of sections in each chapter is also 1.76 x 5 = 8.8 sections per chapter."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fr...
Response:  Firstly, we know that each book has 249 pages and Frank took 3 days to finish each book. So, if he reads for 1 day, how many pages will he read?   Secondly, we can calculate how many pages Frank reads in one day. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so if Frank reads for 1 day, he will read: 249 pages / 7 days = 35 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each book has 66 pages and Frank took 12 days to finish each book. So, if he finished all books, it means he spent 12 x number of books = 492 days reading all the books. Now, let's solve for the number of books. We can set up an equation as follows:  12x = 492  Divide both sides by 12:  x = 40  Therefore, Frank read 40 books.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank took 16 days to finish his favorite book. Secondly, we are given that the book has 112 pages. To find out how many pages Frank read in one day, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days he took to finish the book:  112 pages / 16 days =?  Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We can do so by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2:  2 x 112 = 224  2 x 16 = 32 So, the simplified fraction is:  224/32 = 7 Therefore, Frank read 7 pages per day.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read 8 pages per day. Second, we know that there are 576 pages in total. So, if we divide 576 by 8, we get: 576 / 8 = 72 days Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish his favorite book.
Response:  First, we know that Frank read his favorite book for 30 days to finish it. Second, each chapter had 450 pages, and there were 41 chapters in total. So, if we multiply the number of chapters by the number of pages per chapter, we get the total number of pages in the book:  41 x 450 = 18,450 pages. Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days Frank spent reading to find out how many pages he read per day:  18,450 pages / 30 days = 615 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read an average of 615 pages per day to finish his favorite book.
Response:  First, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 594 pages. We also know that Frank took 607 days to finish reading the book. So let's start with the first chapter.   Chapter 1: Since there are 594 pages in the first chapter, and Frank spent 607 days reading it, he must have read an average of 607/594 = 102 pages per day. Now, let's move on to the second chapter.   Chapter 2: If Frank read 102 pages per day in the first chapter, then he must have read 102 x 2 = 204 pages per day in the second chapter. Finally, let's calculate the number of pages in the third chapter.   Chapter 3: Since Frank read 204 pages per day in the second chapter, he must have read 204 x 3 = 612 pages per day in the third chapter. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is: Chapter 1: 102 pages per day x 607 days = 61,490 pages Chapter 2: 204 pages per day x 607 days = 122,880 pages Chapter 3: 612 pages per day x 607 days = 373,320 pages
Response:  First, we know that the book has two chapters, and each chapter consists of 405 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 2 x 405 = 810 pages. Next, we are given that Frank spent 664 days reading the book. So, to find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading:  810 pages / 664 days = 1.23 pages/day.  Now, we need to round up this value to get the exact number of chapters Frank read per day. Since 1.23 rounds up to 2, we can conclude that Frank read approximately 2 chapters per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 packages of DVDs in total and they cost $120 altogether. So, if we divide $120 by 6, we get the price of one package of DVDs:  
$120 / 6 = $20 per package  Therefore, each package of DVDs costs $20."
Response:  If one package costs $81, then three packages will cost $81 x 3 = $243.   Therefore, purchasing 33 packages of DVDs would cost $243 x 33 = $8,099.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many u...
Response:  First, we need to find out how much each pack of DVDs costs without the discount.  We know that the cost is $76 per pack. Next, we need to subtract the amount of the discount from the total cost to find out how much we pay with the discount. In this case, the discount is $25 per pack, so we subtract $25 from $76 to get our final price: $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you will pay $51 for each pack of DVDs with the discount.
Response:  We know that each package of DVDs costs $26.  If we have $104, how many packages can we buy with this amount of money?   To find out, we can divide the total amount of money we have ($104) by the cost per package ($26):   $104 ÷ $26 =?  Can you solve for x (the number of packages)?  What is your answer?
Response:  We know that $28 is the total amount of money available to spend on DVD discs.  Since there are two packs of DVD discs, we can calculate the cost per pack as follows:   Cost per pack = Total amount / Number of packs   Cost per pack = $28 / 2   Cost per pack = $14 per pack Now, since each pack contains multiple DVD discs, we need to find out how many discs are in each pack.  Let's assume (and it's reasonable) that each pack contains 5 DVD discs.   Therefore, the cost per disk = Cost per pack / Number of disks   Cost per disk = $14 / 5   Cost per disk = $2.80 per disk So, each individual DVD disc costs $2.80.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total and we want to organize them into groups of 2.   To do this, we can divide 18 by 2 to find out how many groups we can make:  18 ÷ 2 = 9 So, there will be 9 groups of 2 bananas each.
Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in total, and each group contains 187 bananas. To find out how many bananas there are in total, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of bananas in each group:  140 x 187 = 25,960 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and they are organized into 7 groups. So each group has:  203 / 7 = 29 bananas per group.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 356 oranges in total and they are organized into 178 groups. So, each group has 356/178 = 2 orange...
Response:  We know that there are 392 bananas in total and they are organized into 196 groups. To find out how many bananas are in each group, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:  392 / 196 =?  Can you solve for x (the number of bananas in each group)?
Response:  We know that there are 180 bananas in total and each group has 18 bananas. To find out how many groups there are, we can divide 180 by 18:  180 / 18 =?  Do you want to try solving this problem yourself before I give you the answer?
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. Therefore, each group has 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Now, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. Since there are 87 oranges, let's divide 145 by 87 to get the number of bananas in each group:  145 / 87 = 16667 So, each group of bananas has 16667 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges in total and they are organized into 16 groups. So each group has 384/16 = 24 oranges.   Now we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. There are 192 bananas in total and they are organized into 345 groups. So each group has 192/345 = 0.56 bananas (since we can't have a fraction of a banana, let's round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, each group of oranges will have 24 + 0.56 = 24.56 fruits in total.
Response:  If Mama Brandy prepared 38 pieces of pecheny and each piece contains 19 pieces of pecheny, then she prepared a total of  38 x 19 = 742 pieces of pecheny for her guests.
Response:  If each person received  30 pieces of pecheniye, then the total number of pieces is:  30 x 14 = 420 pieces of pecheniye.  Therefore, Mama Brandy prepared 420 pieces of pecheniye for 14 people.
Response:  Firstly, we know that mama Brandy prepared 22 pies and had to throw away 17 of them. This means she has 22 - 17 = 5 remaining pies. Since there were 5 people eating the pies, each person got 5/5 = 1 pie.   Therefore, each person got one pie.
Response:  We know that there were 10 guests invited to dinner and only 9 showed up. This means we have 9 x (18/10) = 9 x 1.8 = 16.2 pelmeni left over after each guest received their share. Since no one got a fraction of a pelmeni, we can round down to 16 pelmeni per person. So each guest received 16 pelmeni.
Response:  If Mama Brandy prepared 14 pancakes for 2 guests, then each guest will receive 7 pancakes (14 / 2 = 7).
Response:  If there are 10 pelmeni and each guest has 2 pelmeni, then we can calculate how many guests there will be as follows:  10 pelmeni / 2 pelmeni per guest = 5 guests.  Therefore, Mama Brandy prepared pelmeni for 5 guests.
Response:  If Frank has 42 candies and he wants to divide them equally between two bags, then each bag will have half of 42, which is  21 candies in each bag.
Response:  First, we know that Frank had some amount of candy, which we can call x.  Next, we know that he divided it into 26 packages, and each package contained 33 candies. So, if we let y be the number of candies in one package, then Frank had 26y candies in total.   Now, we need to find out what value of y will make the equation true:  26y = x.  Can you solve for y?
Response:  First, we know that Frank had 33 candies and lost 24 of them. That means he has 33 - 24 = 9 candies left. Next, we are told that he put the remaining candies in packages of 9 each. So, how many packages did he have? To find out, we can divide the number of candies he had left (9) by the number of candies in each package (9): 9 / 9 = 1 package. Therefore, Frank had one package of candies with 9 pieces in it.
Response:  First, we know that Frank put 11 candies in each package. Second, we know that he had a total of 22 candies. So, if we divide 22 by 11, we get...  22 / 11 =... 2 (remember to simplify your fraction)  Therefore, Frank had 2 packages of candies.
Response:  If Frank divided 16 candies equally into two packages, then each package would contain:  16 / 2 = 8 candies.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Shirley sold 25 boxes of ""Trefoil"" pate. Secondly, each box contains 14 packets of pate. Therefore, to calculate how many packets of pate Shirley needs to deliver, we can multiply the number of boxes she sold by the number of packets in each box:  25 x 14 = 350 packets of pate. So, Shirley needs to deliver 350 packets of pate."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Shirley sold 10 boxes of ""Trefoil"" pate. Secondly, she needs to deliver 5 boxes (or crates) in total. Finally, each box contains the same number of units, so we can find out how many units are in each box and then calculate how many boxes fit in 5 crates.   To begin with, let's assume that Shirley sells each box for $x dollars. Then, the revenue from selling 10 boxes would be:  Revenue = 10 x $x  Now, let's turn our attention to the cost of producing each box. We know that Shirley has 100 units of ""Trefoil"" pate to sell, so if she wants to fill 10 boxes, each box must contain:  Number of units per box = Total number of units / Number of boxes  Number of units per box = 100 / 10  Number of units per box = 10  Therefore, each box contains 10 units of ""Trefoil"" pate. Now, let's calculate the total value of all 10 boxes:  Total value = 10 x $x  Since Shirley needs to deliver 5 boxes, we can set up an equation based on this information:  Equation: 5 x $x =?  Where the question mark represents the unknown amount of money that Shirley will receive for delivering 5 boxes.  To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:  Division: 5 x $x = $x + $x + $x + $x + $x  $x = $20  So, the price of one box of ""Trefoil"" pate is $20.  Now that we have found the price of one box, we can easily determine how many boxes fit in 5 crates:  Crates = 5 x 10  Crates = 50  Boxes  Therefore, there are 50 boxes in 5 crates."
Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda there were than bottles of diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda.  67 - 9 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 58 (67 - 9). So, there were 58 more bottles of regular soda than bottles of diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 22 ordinary bottles of soda and 61 dietetic bottles of soda. To find out how many more dietetic bottles there are than ordinary bottles, we need to subtract the number of ordinary bottles from the number of dietetic bottles. So, if we subtract 22 from 61, we get:  61 - 22 = 39. Therefore, there were 39 more dietetic bottles of soda than ordinary bottles.
Response:  We know that there were 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of gas drinks in total. And we also know that there were 41 apples. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  38 + 41 = 79. Therefore, there were 79 bottles in total (including both types of gas drinks and apples).
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of ordinary soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of ordinary soda there are than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of ordinary soda.  79 - 53 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 26 more bottles of ordinary soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda there are than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of regular soda.  54 (bottles of diet soda) - 83 (bottles of regular soda) =?  So, there are 83 - 54 = 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 9 ordinary bottles of soda and x diet bottles of soda. In total, there are 9 + x bottles of soda. Additionally, we know that there are 29 apples. So, let's write down an equation based on this information:  9 + x = 29 + x Equating like terms, we get:  9 + x = 30x Now solve for x by subtracting 9 from both sides:  30x - 9 = 29x x = 21 Therefore, there were 21 diet bottles of soda in the store.
Response:  We know that there were 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda.  60 - 19 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 41 (60 - 19). So, there were 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 + 32 = 104 bottles of gas drinks in total. And we have 78 apples. So, if we compare the number of bottles and apples, we can see that there are more bottles (104) than apples (78). Therefore, the correct answer is ""more bottles""."
Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and we want to find out how many bottles of gasoline are more than the number of apples.  First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of gasoline:  80 + 54 = 134.  Now, compare the total number of bottles with the number of apples:  134 > 36.  So, there are more bottles of gasoline (134) than apples (36).
"Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles in total and 28 of them were ordinary gas carbonation bottles. That means there are only 2 bottles left for diet gas carbonation. So, the answer is 2.  

Question: How many bottles of ordinary gas carbonation were sold if 15 bottles of diet gas carbonation were sold?  Answer:  If 15 bottles of diet gas carbonation were sold, then we can subtract that number from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles of ordinary gas carbonation were sold. There were 30 bottles in total, so if we subtract 15 from 30, we get 15. Therefore, 15 bottles of ordinary gas carbonation were sold."
Response:  We know that there were 4 bottles of diet soda in the store, and each bottle had 79 more bottles of regular soda than it did. So if we let x be the number of bottles of regular soda, then the number of bottles of diet soda is 4 + (x * 79). To find out how many bottles of regular soda there were, we can set up an equation based on this information:  4 + (x * 79) = 79x  Now solve for x to get the number of bottles of regular soda:  x = 18  Therefore, there were 18 bottles of regular soda in the store.
Response:  We know that there were 57 ordinary bottles of soda, and we can add them to our total count.  57 + 26 (diet soda) = 83 Now let's add the light soda. 83 + 27 (light soda) = 110 So, in total, there were 110 bottles of soda in the store.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of ordinary soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of ordinary soda there are than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of ordinary soda.  81 - 60 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 21 more bottles of ordinary soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there were 49 + 40 = 89 bottles of gas drinks in total. And we also know that among them, there were  6 bottles of light gasification. So, to find out how many bottles of ordinary and dietary gasification were, let's subtract the number of bottles of light gasification from the total number of bottles:  89 - 6 = 83. Therefore, there were 83 bottles of ordinary gasification and 40 bottles of dietary gasification.
Response:  First, we know that in the previous day there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace. Now, we are given that in today's day, there were 317 visitors. So, we need to find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace today compared to yesterday. To do this, we can subtract the number of visitors from yesterday from the number of visitors today:  317 - 295 = 22. Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday.
Response:  We know that in the previous day (the day before Raechel and her family visited), there were 246 visitors to Buckingham Palace. And we also know that in total, there were 703 visitors over the past 25 days. So, if we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors, we can find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace during the other 25 days:  703 - 246 = 457 Therefore, 457 people visited Buckingham Palace during the other 25 days.
"Response:  We know that in the previous day (yesterday), there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace. Today, Rachel found out that there were 100 more visitors than yesterday. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the number of visitors today. Then we know that yesterday, there were 666 - x visitors.  Now let's add both equations together:  

x + (666 - x) = 100 + 666  

Simplifying the equation:  

2x + 666 = 766  

Subtracting 666 from both sides:  

2x = 90  

Dividing both sides by 2:  

x = 45  

So, there were 45 more visitors to Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday."
Response:  We know that in the last 327 days, 406 people visited Buckingham Palace. This means that on average, 1.25 people visit the palace every day (406 / 327 = 1.25). Now we are given that on the day after Raechel and her friends visited, 132 visitors came to the palace. To find out how many visitors visited the palace the previous day, we can subtract the number of visitors on the day Raechel visited from the total average daily visitors:  132 - 1.25 x 327 = 132 - 406 = -274. Therefore, there were -274 visitors (negative 274) to Buckingham Palace the previous day.
Response:  We know that in the previous day, the Buckingham Palace received 45 visitors. And we also know that in the last 85 days, the palace received a total of 829 visitors. So, if we divide the total number of visitors by the number of visitors in one day, we can find out how many days it took for the palace to receive 829 visitors.  829 / 45 = 18.6 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, the palace received 1860 visitors in 85 days.
"Response:  We know that there were 557 visitors in one day and 188 visitors in the previous day, so we can start by finding out how many days have passed since the beginning of the year.  
We know that the current date is March 20th, and the year starts from January 1st, so we can calculate the number of days as follows: 
March 20th - January 1st = 69 days (since the beginning of the year)  Now, let's find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace during these 69 days. We know that there were 557 visitors on the current day and 188 visitors on the previous day, so we can add up their numbers to get the total number of visitors for the entire period:  
557 + 188 = 745 visitors (for 69 days)  Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many people visited Buckingham Palace in 57 days?"" is:  
745 visitors x 57 days = 41,345 visitors (in 57 days)"
"Response:  First, we know that there were 661 visitors in the Buckingham Palace on the current day and 600 visitors in the previous day. So, to find out how many more visitors visited the palace in the current day than in the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors in the previous day from the number of visitors in the current day.  

So, if we subtract 600 from 661, we get:  

661 - 600 = 61  Therefore, there were 61 more visitors in the Buckingham Palace in the current day than in the previous day."
Response:  We know that in the previous day there were 103 visitors and yesterday there were 419 visitors, so we can add these numbers to find out how many visitors came before yesterday:  103 + 419 = 522 Now we need to subtract this number from the total number of visitors on the current day (92) to find out how many visitors visited the palace before today:  92 - 522 = 430 So, 430 visitors visited the palace before today.
Response:  First, we know that there were 471 visitors yesterday and 808 visitors two days ago. So, in total, there were 471 + 808 = 1279 visitors in the last two days. Now, we are told that today there were 512 visitors. Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last eighty-nine days is  1279 + 512 = 1791 people.
Response:  First, we know that in total there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day Raechel visited. We also know that there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors two days ago. To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day Raechel visited than in the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors from each of those days from the total number of visitors.   Total Visitors = 705  Previous Day Visitors = 191  Two Days Ago Visitors = 457  So, we can start by subtracting the number of visitors from each of those days from the total number of visitors:   Total Visitors - Previous Day Visitors = 705 - 191 = 514  Total Visitors - Two Days Ago Visitors = 705 - 457 = 248  Now we add these two calculations together to get the difference between the total number of visitors on the day Raechel visited and the average number of visitors over the previous 245 days:  514 + 248 = 762  Therefore, there were 762 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day Raechel visited than in the previous 245 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of glue needed for the feathers is 628 grams. Secondly, we are told that the current amount of glue available to our craftsperson is 470 grams. So, what is the difference between these two amounts? To find out, subtract the smaller number from the larger one:  628 - 470 = 158 grams. Therefore, our craftsperson has 158 grams of glue left before they need to purchase more.
Response:  Firstly, we know that he needs 260 grams of wax to cover all the feathers. Secondly, we know that each feather requires 288 grams of wax for proper adhesion and coloring. Therefore, if he has 260 grams of wax already, it means that he can cover (260/288) = 91 feathers with wax. Since there are 95 feathers in total, this leaves him with 4 feathers uncovered (95 - 91 = 4). So, he has 4 grams of wax left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that he needs 22 g of wax for the feathers and 57 g of paint for painting them. So, in total, he needs 79 g of materials. Now, we are given that he has 353 g of wax already, which is more than what he needs. Therefore, the amount of wax he already has is:  353 g - 79 g = 274 g.
Response:  First, we know that the total amount of glue needed for all feathers is 166 grams.  Secondly, we are given that the current amount of glue available to us is 20 grams.  To find out how much more glue is needed, we subtract the current amount from the total amount:  166 - 20 = 146 grams.  So, we need 146 grams more glue.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much of the 557 g of wax is needed for the 17 g required for the feathers. To do this, we can divide the amount required (17 g) by the total amount available (557 g):  17 g / 557 g = 0.031 or 3.1% So, 3.1% of the total amount of wax (557 g) is needed for the feathers. Therefore, the answer is 3.1 x 557 g = 176.97 g.
Response:  First, we know that the total amount of glue needed for the feathers is 492 grams. Secondly, the current amount of glue available to us is 11 grams. So, we need to subtract the current amount from the total amount to find out how much more glue we need.   Calculation: Total amount of glue = 492 g Current amount of glue = 11 g Therefore, More glue needed = Total amount - Current amount = 492 g - 11 g = 481 g  So, we still need 481 grams of glue.
Response:  We know that there are 94 gatherers and they fill 90 barrels in 6 days. So, we can calculate how many barrels each gatherer fills per day.  📝 To do this, let's divide the total number of barrels filled (90) by the number of gatherers (94): 90 / 94 = 0.97  Now, we need to find out how many barrels one gatherer can fill in a day. To do this, we multiply the result from the previous calculation by the number of gatherers: 0.97 x 94 = 89.36  Finally, we round up the result to the nearest whole number to get the daily filling for one barrel: 89.36 rounded up to 90 barrels per day.  Therefore, if there were 1 more gatherer, they would fill an additional 90 barrels per day.
Response:  We know that there are 266 collectors and they fill 90 barrels in 5 days. So we can start with the fact that each day they will fill 18 barrels (90 / 5 = 18). Now let's calculate how many barrels they will fill per day. To do this, we divide the number of collectors by the number of barrels filled per day: 266 collectors / 18 barrels per day = 14 days. Therefore, the collectors will fill 14 barrels per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 294 gatherers and they fill 244 barrels of grapes per day. So, in one day, each gatherer fills approximately 0.83 barrels (244/294) of grapes. Now, let's calculate how many barrels will be filled in 146 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of gatherers by the number of days:  294 x 146 = 43,592 barrels  Of course, not all of these barrels will be filled with grapes - some will also contain malina (raspberries). However, since we don't know the exact proportion of grape to raspberry filling, we cannot accurately determine the total number of barrels filled with grapes. Therefore, our final answer is 43,592 barrels.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 235 gatherers collecting grapes in one day and they can collect 100 barrels of malina (a type of grape) in one day. So, if there is only one day left for harvesting, then the total number of barrels collected would be:  100 x 235 = 23500 barrels  Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to collect 221 barrels of grapes per day. We know that there are 221 gatherers collecting grapes in one day. So, the total number of days required to collect 221 barrels of grapes would be:  221 / 235 = 94 days  Since there are 77 days remaining for harvesting, we need to subtract the number of days required to collect 221 barrels from the total number of days available for harvesting:  77 - 94 = 13 days  Therefore, the total number of barrels of grapes that will be collected in 77 days is:  23500 + (13 x 221) = 23500 + 2863 = 26363 barrels
Response:  We know that there are 108 bottles of wine in each day and 252 collectors collecting them. So we can calculate how many bottles will be collected in total over 58 days as follows:   Total number of bottles = Number of collectors x Number of bottles per day  Total number of bottles = 252 x 108  Total number of bottles = 26,744 bottles  Therefore, there will be 26,744 bottles filled with wine over 58 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 gatherers and they fill 8 barrels per day. So, to calculate how many days it will take to fill 240 barrels, we need to divide the number of barrels by the number of gatherers per day.  

240 barrels / 8 barrels/day = 30 days  Therefore, it will take 30 days to fill 240 barrels with 36 gatherers working per day."
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has an equal number of marine animals. So, if we divide 52 (total number of marine animals) by 26 (number of aquariums), we get:  52 / 26 = 2 Each aquarium has 2 marine animals.
Response:  We know that there were 40 marine animals in total and each aquarium had two animals. So we can start by dividing 40 by 2 to get the number of groups of animals:  40 / 2 = 20 Now we need to find out how many aquariums he had. Since each group of animals was in one aquarium, we can simply divide the number of groups by 1 to get the number of aquariums:  20 / 1 = 20 Therefore, the man had 20 aquariums with two marine animals in each aquarium.
Response:  First, we know that Taylor has 56 aquariums for marine animals. Second, each aquarium contains 39 animals. Therefore, to find out how many marine animals Taylor has in total, we can multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:  56 aquariums x 39 animals/aquarium = 2,244 marine animals.
Response:  First, we know that Taylor has 22 aquariums for marine animals. Next, each aquarium contains 46 animals, so...  22 x 46 =?  That's right! Taylor has 998 marine animals in total.
Response:  First, we know that there are 15 aquariums for marine animals and each has 19 animals, so the total number of marine animals is:  15 x 19 = 285  Next, we know that there are 62 aquariums for freshwater animals and each has 19 animals as well, so the total number of freshwater animals is:  62 x 19 = 1178  Therefore, in total, there are 285 + 1178 = 1463 animals.

Response:  First, we know that there are 53 footballs in each pack. So if mama buys 57 packs of white footballs, she will have:  57 x 53 = 3091 white footballs.
Response:  If mama buys 51 white football jerseys and each pack contains 3 jerseys, then she will buy:  51 / 3 = 17 packs of jerseys.
Response:  We know that mama buys in total 70 white T-shirts and she buys them in packs of 14 each time. So we can start with the equation:  70 = 14x where x is the number of packs she buys. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:  70/14 = x x = 5 Since mama buys 5 packs of 14 football t-shirts each time, there are 5 x 14 = 70 white football t-shirts in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 bags and 36 cookies in total.  If each bag has the same number of cookies, then we can set up an equation based on this information.  
Let x be the number of cookies in one bag. Since there are 4 bags, we can write the equation as 4x = 36.  Now, let's simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 4. This gives us x = 9.  So, each bag contains 9 cookies."
Response:  If I have 33 pieces of pecheny and each package contains 11 pieces, then to find out how many packages I need, we can divide 33 by 11.  33 / 11 =?  Yes, that's right! There are 3 packets of pecheny.
Response:  If each package has 41 cookies and there are 53 packages in total, then we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows:   Total number of cookies = Number of packages x Number of cookies per package  Total number of cookies = 53 x 41  Total number of cookies = 2193  Therefore, there will be 2193 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that there are 14 pieces of candy in total and 7 packages with equal amounts of candy. So we can start by dividing 14 by 7 to find out how many candies are in each package:  14 / 7 = 2 Now we know that each package contains 2 pieces of candy.
Response:  If there are 3 pecheniya in each package and we have 21 pieces of pecheniya altogether, then we can calculate how many packages we need as follows:  21 = 3 x?  We know that 3 x 7 = 21 (since 7 is the number of packages), so we can solve for x:  x = 7  Therefore, we need 7 packages of pecheniya to account for all 21 pieces.
"Response:  We know that there are  15 candies and 52 pieces of pecheny in total. Since each package contains an equal number of pieces of pecheny, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:  15 = 52 / x  where ""x"" is the number of packages of pecheny. Solving for ""x"", we get:  x = 3  Therefore, there are 3 packages of pecheny with an equal number of pieces in each package."
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags in total and each bag has the same number of pieces of candy. So, we can start by finding out how many pieces of candy are in one bag.   We know that there are 28 pieces of candy in total (28 peaches + 86 candies). Therefore, if we divide 28 by 14, we get an average of 2 pieces of candy per bag. This means that each bag contains 2 pieces of candy.  Now, let's find out how many bags have peanuts. We know that there are 28 peanuts in total. If we divide 28 by 2, we get 14 bags with peanuts. Therefore, there are 14 bags with peanuts.
"Response:  If Postal worker should distribute 5 unwanted pieces of mail to each house in a quarter and he gives 25 letters to each house, then we can conclude that there are 5 houses in one quarter.  
So, the number of homes in one quarter is 5."
Response:  If Postchalon needs to distribute 9 unwanted pieces of mail to each house on every block and there are 20 houses on each block, then he will need to distribute 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of mail per block.   Therefore, Postchalon must deliver 180 pieces of mail per block.
"Response:  If there are 6 houses on each block and the postal worker needs to distribute 24 pieces of advertising mail per house, then they will need to deliver 24 x 6 = 144 pieces of advertising mail in total for that block.  
So, the postal worker should give 144/6 = 24 pieces of advertising mail to each house on that block."
Response:  If the postman gives 2 advertising letters to each block and he distributes 14 advertising letters in total, then we can write an equation based on this information:  14 = 2 x (some number) Since the postman gives 2 letters to each block, we know that the number of blocks is equal to the number of letters divided by 2:  14 = 2 x (number of blocks) Now solve for the number of blocks:  14 = 2 x 7 So there are 7 blocks in the building.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 houses in one quarter and each house needs 32 pieces of promotional mail. Therefore, the total number of pieces of promotional mail needed for one quarter is:  20 x 32 = 640 pieces.  So, the postal worker must distribute 640 pieces of promotional mail in each quarter.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many pieces of unwanted mail each house in the block should receive. We know that there are 30 pieces of unwanted mail for every 78 blocks and 19 houses in each block. Therefore, each house should receive:  30 / 78 \* 19 = 2.5 pieces of unwanted mail per house.  So, each house in the block should receive 2 or 3 pieces of unwanted mail (since we can't have a fraction of a piece).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Postchalon has to deliver 8 unwanted letters to each of the 55 blocks. This means he needs to deliver a total of 55 x 8 = 440 letters. Now, if he delivers 32 letters to each house in every block, then the number of houses in each block is 32. Therefore, the total number of houses in all 55 blocks is 55 x 32 = 1760 houses.
Response:  If there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, then the total number of houses is:  81 x 12 = 972 houses.  Since Postal worker should distribute 4 advertising letters to each house, the total number of advertising letters he needs to deliver is:  972 x 4 = 3888 advertising letters.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many houses there are in total in all 16 blocks. Since each block has 17 houses, and there are 16 blocks, the total number of houses is:  17 x 16 = 272 houses To find out how many pieces of advertising mail Postal should give, we multiply the total number of houses by 4:  272 houses x 4 pieces per house = 1088 pieces of advertising mail Postal needs to distribute.

Response:  We have  10 mraorms and 15 eggs in total. To divide them into groups of 5, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these numbers.  10 + 15 = 25 So, there will be 25/5 = 5 groups of 5 each.
Response:  If Rebekka has 11 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 2, then she will have:  11 / 2 = 5 groups of 2 eggs each.  So, Rebekka has 5 x 2 = 10 eggs in total.
Response:  We have 8 eggs and we want to divide them into 4 groups. To do this, we can use division.  8 ÷ 4 =? The result of this calculation is 2. So each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We have 4 mramors and 15 eggs in total. If we divide them into 3 groups, each group will have:  4/3 = 1 2/3 mramors (since there are 4 mramors in total) And since each mramor contains 2 eggs, each group will have:  1 2/3 x 2 = 3 2/3 eggs (since each mramor contains 2 eggs) Therefore, there will be 3 groups of eggs, with 3 2/3 eggs in each group.
Response:  We know that we have 18 eggs and we want to divide them into groups of 6. So, we can calculate how many groups we can make as follows:  18 / 6 =?  Can you solve for x (the number of groups)?
Response:  We have  99 bananas and we want to divide them into groups of 3. So, we can make  99/3 = 33 groups of bananas. Now, we also have 9 eggs and we want to distribute them among these groups. Since each group will get 3 eggs, we can place 9 / 3 = 3 eggs in each group. Finally, we have 27 marbles and we want to distribute them among these groups as well. Since each group will get 27 / 3 = 9 marbles, we can place 9 marbles in each group. Therefore, there will be 33 groups in total, with 3 eggs, 9 marbles, and 3 bananas in each group.
Response:  We know that Rebekka has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. To divide the collection into groups of 5, we need to find out how many groups she can make.   Groups = Number of objects / Group size  In this case, Groups = 20 / 5 = 4 Since there are 4 groups, Rebekka has more eggs (20) than marbles (6).
Response:  First, we know that Rebekka has 5 mra...

"Response:  We know that in total there are  907611 + 455682 = 1363293 children.  If 907611 children remain at home during summer vacation, then the number of children who go to camp is:  
455682 - 907611 = 357971. Therefore, approximately 357971 children from the district Lawrence will be in the camp."
Response:  We know that 800059 children went to camp, and we want to find out how many remained at home. To do this, we subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in the district.   Total number of children = 828521 - 800059 = 284662 So there are approximately 284662 children remaining at home during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that 61619 children remained at home during summer vacation and there are in total of 91676 children in Lawrence County. So we can calculate how many children went to camp as follows:  91676 - 61619 = 30057. Therefore, approximately 30057 children from Lawrence County went to camp.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many children from the Lawrence district attended camp:  34044 (the number of children who went to camp) / 134867 (the total number of children in the district) = 0.25 or 25% of the children in the district attended camp. Now let's find out how many children visited the camp overall:  34044 (children from the Lawrence district) + 424944 (children from other districts) = 459008 (total number of children visiting the camp).
Response:  First, we know that in total there are 610769 + 590796 = 1201565 children in all districts.  Secondly, we know that 22 children come from other districts to this camp, so they should be subtracted from the total number of children. Therefore, the number of children in district Lawrence is:  1201565 - 22 = 1201543.
"Response:  We know that in total there are 644997 + 893835 = 1538832 children.  Of these, 644997 children stayed at home during the summer holidays, so we have:  
1538832 - 644997 = 893835 children who went to camp.  Additionally, 78 children from other districts visited the camp, so we have:  
893835 + 78 = 894613 children in the district.  Therefore, there are 894613 children in the Lawrence district."
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has x apples (where x is a variable). Since Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie, we can write an equation based on this information:  9 = x + 3. Now solve for x to find out how many apples Jackie has:  x = 6. So Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  First, we know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has.  10 - 2 =?  That gives us... 8! So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam. To do this, subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has:  9 (Adam) - 10 (Jackie) =?  So, Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  First, we know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam. To do this, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:  10 - 8 = 2 So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 6 apples. If he has more than twice as many apples as they do, then he must have at least  2 x 6 = 12 apples. So, his number of apples is greater than or equal to 12.
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 7 apples. So if one of them has 9 apples, the other must have 7 - 9 = 2 apples. Therefore, the person who has 9 apples is not Adam or Jackie.  
So, the correct answer is 9."
Response:  We know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so if we let A represent the number of apples Adam has, then A + 8 represents the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have together.   Since Jackie has 9 more apples than Adam, we can say that J = A + 9, where J is the number of apples Jackie has.  Now we need to find out how many apples they have in total.  So we add A + 8 and J:  A + 8 + (A + 9) =?  Can you solve for the missing variable?
"Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 4 apples.  Together, they have 2 apples.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
x + (x + 4) = 2...  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x + 4 = 2...  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  
2x = 2...  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
x = 1...  So Jackie has 1 apple and Adam has 5 apples (since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie)."
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, then Adam must have at least 11 + 89 = 100 fruits in total (since he has more apples). Since we are only interested in the number of apples, let's subtract the number of oranges from the total number of fruits:  100 - 89 = 11. Therefore, Adam has 11 apples.
Response:  First, we know that Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday, so she has already baked  31 cookies.  Second, we know that today morning, she baked 270 cookies, so in total, she has baked  31 + 270 = 301 cookies. Finally, we know that before last night, she baked 419 cookies, so in total, Helen has baked  301 + 419 = 720 cookies. Therefore, Helen baked 720 cookies before last night.
Response:  We know that Elena baked 90 pecheny with chocolate drops yesterday and 51 pecheny with poppy seeds today in the morning. So, in total, she baked  90 + 51 = 141 pecheny. Of these, 90 had chocolate drops, so Elena baked  141 - 90 = 51 pecheny with chocolate drops.
Response:  First, we know that Elena baked 527 chocolate chip muffins and 86 muffins with poppy seeds yesterday. Today, she baked 86 muffins with poppy seeds and 554 chocolate chip muffins. So, in total, Elena baked:  527 + 86 = 613 muffins with various fillings. Of these, 527 were chocolate chip muffins, so Elena baked:  527 x 2 = 1054 chocolate chip muffins today.
Response:  First, we know that yesterday Helen baked 397 cookies with raisins and 144 cookies with chocolate drops. So, in total, she baked  397 + 144 = 541 cookies. Today, she baked 85 cookies with raisins and 403 cookies with chocolate drops. Therefore, the total number of cookies she baked today is  85 + 403 = 488 cookies. Now, let's find out how many cookies with raisins Helen baked today. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies she baked yesterday from the total number of cookies she baked today:  541 - 397 = 144 cookies with raisins. So, Helen baked 144 cookies with raisins today.
Response:  We know that Elena baked 19 pies with chocolate drops yesterday and 237 pies with chocolate drops today morning. Also, she baked 231 pies with poppy seeds yesterday. To find out how many more pies with chocolate drops Elena baked than with poppy seeds, we need to subtract the number of pies with poppy seeds from the number of pies with chocolate drops. So, let's do it:  237 - 231 = 6. Therefore, Elena baked 6 more pies with chocolate drops than with poppy seeds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that yesterday Elena baked 197 chocolate-drop cookies and 46 cookie with poppy seeds in total. Today she baked 75 cookies with poppy seeds and 66 chocolate-drop cookies. Now let's compare how many more chocolate-drop cookies Elena baked today compared to yesterday. To do this, subtract the number of chocolate-drop cookies she baked yesterday from the number of chocolate-drop cookies she baked today:  75 - 197 =?  There are 120 fewer chocolate-drop cookies that Elena baked today than she did yesterday. So, Elena baked 120 fewer chocolate-drop cookies today than she did yesterday.
"Response:  Yesterday, Elena baked 300 pies with poppy seeds and 280 pies with chocolate drops today. So, yesterday she baked 300 + 280 = 580 pies in total. Now, let's compare how many pies with poppy seeds she baked yesterday and today:  
Yesterday: 300 pies with poppy seeds Today: 280 pies with poppy seeds Difference: 20 (300 - 280) Therefore, Elena baked 20 more pies with poppy seeds today than she did yesterday."
Response:  We know that Katy had 81 games and her friends had 59 games. To find out how many more games Katy has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has:  81 - 59 =?  The difference between the two numbers is:  22. So Katy has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Katy had 91 games for her Nintendo DS.  Next, we are told that her new friends have 88 games and her old friends have 53 games.  To find out how many games all of Katy's friends have together, we need to add the number of games her new friends have (88) to the number of games her old friends have (53).   So, all of Katy's friends have a total of:  88 + 53 = 141 games.
Response:  First, we know that Katy had 78 new games and her friends had 48 new games. So together they have:  78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many new games Katy has. We know that she had 84 new games. Next, we need to find out how many new games her friends have. We know that they have 8 new games. Finally, we can add up all of these new games to find out how many new games they have together. So, let's do it!  84 + 8 = 92. Therefore, Katy and her friends have 92 new games together.
Response:  First, we know that Katy had 80 old games and her friends had 41 old games. So, in total, they have:  80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katy had 63 games for her Nintendo DS and her friends had 57 games in total. To find out how many more games Katy has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has.  63 - 57 =?  The difference between the two numbers is 63 - 57 = 6. So Katy has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Katy has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 57 + 39 = 96 games.  Now, we know that her friends have 34 new games, but we don't know how many old games they have. So let's assume that they have x old games (since we don't know the exact number). In total, then, her friends have 34 + x games.  To find out how many more games Katy has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katy has:  96 - (34 + x) =?  We can simplify this equation by first adding 34 and x:  96 + 34 + x =?  120 + x =?  Now we can solve for x:  120 + x = 120 + 96 = 216  Therefore, Katy has 216 - 34 = 182 more games than her friends.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $60 and Jason had $19.  Second, we know that Jason has $33 now after washing cars.   So, to find out how much money Jason made, we need to subtract what he had before from what he has now:   $$ 33 - 19 =? $$  Answer:  $14.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $86 and Jason had $5.   Next, we know that Fred earned $9 from washing cars, so he has $86 + $9 = $95 now.  Since Jason didn't work, he still only has $5.  Therefore, together they have $95 + $5 = $100.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $19 and Jason had $16 before they washed their cars.   Next, we know that after washing their cars, Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So, to find out how much money Fred earned, we need to subtract what he had before from what he has now.  Here's the calculation:  40 - 19 = 21 dollars.  Therefore, Fred earned $21 over the weekend.
"Response:  First, we know that Fred had $114 and Jason had $22 at the beginning of the weekend.  Next, we know that after washing their cars, Fred has $21 left and Jason has $78 left. So, let's subtract what they spent from what they had before:  
Fred: $114 - $21 = $93 (lost)  
Jason: $22 - $78 = (-$56) (lost)  Since Jason lost $56 and Fred lost $93, we can say that Jason earned $93 - $56 = $37 during the weekend."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $111 and now he has $115, so he earned $4 more than before.  Second, we know that Jason had $40 and now he has $44, so he earned $4 more than before too.   Therefore, Fred earned $4 and Jason also earned $4, for a total of $8.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $49 and now he has $112, so he earned $63 more than before ($112 - $49 = $63).   Second, we know that Jason had $3 and now he has $63, so he earned $60 more than before ($63 - $3 = $60). Therefore, together they earned $63 + $60 = $123.
Response:  First, we know that Jason had $31 and now he has $14 more, so he has $31 + $14 = $45.  Next, we know that Fred had $78 and now he has $90, so he has $78 + $90 = $168.   Finally, we can subtract the amount that Jason had before ($31) from the amount he has now ($45) to find out how much he earned delivering newspapers: $45 - $31 = $14.   Similarly, we can subtract the amount that Fred had before ($78) from the amount he has now ($168) to find out how much he earned washing cars: $168 - $78 = $90.
"Response:  First, we know that Fred had $33 and earned $16 from delivering newspapers. So, he has $33 + $16 = $49. Next, we know that he washed cars for $74. Therefore, his total earnings are $49 + $74 = $123.  

So, Fred earned $123 over the weekend."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $47 last week and Jason had $99.  Next, we know that Fred earned $111 from delivering newspapers and $34 from washing cars for a total of $145. So, how much does Fred have now?   To find out, we need to add what Fred had before ($47) to what he earned ($145):  $47 + $145 =?  Can you solve this problem and tell me the amount of money Fred has now?
Response:  First, we know that Jessie weighed 71 kg before she started running every day.  Second, we know that she lost 20 kg after starting her daily runs.  So, to find out how much Jessie weighs now, we need to subtract 20 kg from her original weight of 71 kg.  71 kg - 20 kg =?  Answer: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg.  Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 51 kg.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 101 kilograms after starting to run every day. So, if she currently weighs 27 kilograms, we can set up an equation based on this information:  27 kg - 101 kg = x kg (where x is her weight before starting to run) To solve for x, we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation:  101 kg - 27 kg = x kg - 27 kg Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:  74 kg = x kg Since Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms and lost 101 kilograms, it means she used to weigh 74 kilograms before beginning her daily running routine.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 126 kilograms during her running routine. Second, we know that she currently weighs 66 kilograms. Finally, we can use subtraction to find out how much she weighed before starting her running routine.   So, if she lost 126 kilograms and now weighs 66 kilograms, then she must have weighed:  126 kg - 66 kg =?  The answer is:  60 kg.  Therefore, Jessie weighed 60 kilograms before starting her daily running routine.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 35 kilograms (kg) after starting to run every day. We also know that she used to weigh 69 kg before starting her running routine. So, if we subtract 35 kg from 69 kg, we get:  69 kg - 35 kg =?  Answer: 64 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 64 kg.
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 50 kg in the first week and then another 60 kg in the second week. So, if we add up these two amounts, she has lost a total of  50 + 60 = 110 kg.  Since she started at 114 kg, this means she now weighs  114 - 110 = 4 kg.  Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 4 kilograms less than she did before she began running, or 110 kg.
"Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week. So, if she started at x kg, then she lost (x - 62) + (x - 140) = 202 kg total. Since she currently weighs 9 kg, we can set up an equation:  

x - 62 + 140 = 9 

Solving for x gives us: 

x = 258 kg 

So, before starting to run, Jessie weighed approximately 258 kilograms."
Response:  First, we know that Jessie lost 56 kilograms in the first week of running. So if she started at 92 kilograms, after one week she would have weighed  92 - 56 = 36 kilograms.
Response:  We know that there are 95 zebras in total and 64 of them are hiding. So, we can subtract 64 from 95 to find out how many zebras are not hiding:  95 - 64 =?  The result is 31. Therefore, there are 31 zebras that are not hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 93 zmei and 97 alligators in total. If 40 alligators hide, then we need to find out how many alligators do not hide. To do this, subtract the number of hiding alligators (40) from the total number of alligators (97):  97 - 40 =?  The result is 57. Therefore, 57 alligators do not hide.
Response:  We know that there are 3 zmei and 75 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators are hiding, then we can subtract the number of snakes and alligators that are hiding from the total number of each species to find out how many of each species are not hiding.   For the snakes: 82 - 3 = 79  So, 79 snakes are hiding.  For the alligators: 19 - 75 = -56  There are no alligators hiding because the negative sign indicates that they are all hiding. Therefore, none of the alligators are not hiding.  In summary, 79 snakes are hiding, but none of the alligators are hiding.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the enclosure, and 24 zmeis and 51 alligators are hiding. This means that the remaining animals are not hiding. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:   Total number of animals = Number of zmeis + Number of alligators + Number of non-hiding animals Non-hiding animals = Total number of animals - (Number of zmeis + Number of alligators) Non-hiding animals = 79 - (24 + 51) Non-hiding animals = 79 - 75 Non-hiding animals = 4 So, there are 4 animals that do not hide in the enclosure.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday.  Second, we know that he picked 134 of them yesterday and 30 today.  So, how many tomatoes does the farmer have left after today?   To find out, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes the farmer picked today (30) from the total number of tomatoes he had yesterday (171).  Here's the calculation:  171 - 30 =?  The answer is: 141  Therefore, the farmer has 141 tomatoes left after today.
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden to start with.  Yesterday, he picked 56 of them, so now we need to subtract 56 from 160.  160 - 56 =?  That gives us our first number. Now, today, he picked 41 more, so we need to add 41 to our previous answer.  124 + 41 =?  Does anyone have the final answer?
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden to start with.  Yesterday, he picked 154 of them, so now he has 90 - 154 =? tomatoes left. Today, he picked 50 more, so now he has? + 50 =? tomatoes left. To find out how many tomatoes the farmer harvested in total, we need to add up the two amounts:? + 50 =?. Can you solve for the missing number(s)?
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he collected 172 potatoes, then he must have had 77 + 172 = 249 potatoes in total. Since he only collected 172, there are 249 - 172 = 77 potatoes left. Now, let's find out how many tomatoes are left. We know that the farmer started with 175 tomatoes. If he collected 0 tomatoes (since we assumed that he did not collect any), then there would be 175 tomatoes left. Therefore, there are 175 tomatoes left. So, to summarize, the farmer has 77 potatoes and 175 tomatoes left after harvesting.
"Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 177 
   tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left.  Since there is no mention of any change in the number of potatoes, he still has 12 potatoes.  Therefore, the total number of vegetables the farmer has left is 124 tomatoes + 12 potatoes = 136."
Response:  First, we know that the farmer had 105 green peppers and 71 red peppers in his garden.  Next, we are told that he collected 137 peppers.  So, let's add the number of green and red peppers together to find out how many peppers the farmer had altogether:  105 + 71 = 176  Now, we can subtract the number of peppers the farmer collected from the total number of peppers he had:  176 - 137 = 39  Therefore, there are 39 peppers left in the farmer's garden.
"Response:  If John needs 2 gvozdy for each board and he has 4 gvozdy in total, then he can use 2 boards with 2 gvozdy each. So, John will need 2 x 2 = 4 boards for the wall of his house.  

Question: How many boards does John have if he has enough to build one wall of his house?  Answer:  Based on the previous calculation, John needs 4 boards for one wall. Therefore, he must have at least 4 boards to build one wall of his house."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many gvozdev (screws) John needs for each large board:  17 gwozdev per board x 13 boards = 221 gwozdev For some smaller boards, he will also need 8 screws. So, in total, John will need: 221 + 8 = 229 screws To build the wall of his house.
Response:  We know that John needs 11 gvozdev (nails) to attach the wooden boards to the wall of his house. And we also know that each board requires 3 nails for attachment. So, if we divide 11 by 3, we get:  11 / 3 = 3 Therefore, John needs 3 boards for the wall of his house.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many big boards John will use for the wall of his house. We know that he needs 12 big boards and each board requires 15 screws for assembly. So, in total, John will use  12 x 15 = 180 screws for the big boards. Now let's move on to the small boards. We know that John will use 10 small boards and each board requires 5 screws for assembly. Therefore, the number of screws required for the small boards is  10 x 5 = 50 screws. In total, John will require  180 + 50 = 230 screws for building the walls of his house.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many gvozdev (gwoz-deev) John will use for each board. We know that he needs two gwozdev for each board. So if he uses 16 boards, he will use 16 x 2 = 32 gwozdev in total.  
Now let's check our calculation. Do you agree with it?"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many gvozdi (gwo-zih-dee) are needed for each board. Then, we can multiply that number by the total number of boards to find out how many gwozdi John will need in total.   To calculate how many gwozdi are needed for each board, we know that there are 74 gwozdi per board. So, if we divide 74 by 10 (since there are 10 cm in 1 decimeter), we get:  74 / 10 = 7.4   Now, let's calculate how many boards John needs for the wall of his house:  We know that he needs 8 big boards. If we divide 8 by 7.4 (the number of gwozdi per board), we get:  8 / 7.4 = 10.8   Since you cannot have a fraction of a board, John will need 11 boards for the wall of his house. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many big boards John will use for the wall of his house. We know that he needs 12 big boards and each board requires 14 screws. So, we can calculate as follows:  12 big boards x 14 screws per board = 168 screws  Now let's calculate how many small boards John will use. We know that he needs 17 small boards and each board requires 25 screws. So, we can calculate as follows:  17 small boards x 25 screws per board = 425 screws  Total number of screws required = 168 + 425 = 693 screws Therefore, John will require 693 screws in total to build the walls of his house using both big and small boards.
Response:  We know that Robin has 42 pieces of chewing gum in total and each pack contains 3 pieces. So we can start by dividing 42 by 3 to find out how many packs Robin has:  42 / 3 =?  Do you want to try solving this problem yourself before I give you the answer?
Response:  First, we know that Robin has 43 packs of chewing gum. Second, each pack contains 23 pieces of gum. Finally, Robin has 8 extra pieces of gum. So, to find out how many pieces of gum Robin has in total, we can multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces in each pack and add the number of extra pieces:   Total = Number of Packs x Number of Pieces per Pack + Extra Pieces  Total = 43 x 23 + 8  Total = 961 + 8  Total = 970  Therefore, Robin has 970 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 41 pieces of chewing gum in total and each pack contains 7 pieces. So we can start by dividing 41 by 7 to find out how many packs Robin has:  41 / 7 =?  The result is: 6 With a remainder of 2. This means that Robin has 6 complete packs of chewing gum and 2 extra pieces left over.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 u...
"Response:  First, we know that Robin has 21 packs of chewing gum and each pack contains 9 pieces. So, if we multiply 21 by 9, we get:  
21 x 9 = 189  Now, we know that Robin also has 45 packs of candy and each pack contains 9 pieces as well. So, if we multiply 45 by 9, we get:  
45 x 9 = 405  Therefore, in total, Robin has 189 + 405 = 694 candies."
Response:  First, we know that Robin has 28 packages of chewing gum and each package contains 6 pieces. So, if we multiply 28 by 6, we get:  28 x 6 = 168 pieces of chewing gum. Now, let's talk about the candy. Robin has 14 packages of candy and each package contains 6 pieces as well. If we multiply 14 by 6, we get:  14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy. In total, Robin has 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy and gum.
Response:  We know that the industrial stand can produce 3 shirts per minute. If 6 shirts were produced in total, we need to find out how many minutes the stand worked.  6 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 2 minutes So, the industrial stand worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  We know that the industrial stand worked for 5 minutes and could make 4 shirts per minute. So we can calculate how many shirts it made in total as follows:   Total number of shirts = Number of minutes x Number of shirts per minute  Total number of shirts = 5 x 4  Total number of shirts = 20  Therefore, the industrial stand made 20 shirts during its 5-minute operation.
Response:  We know that the industrial sewing machine made 9 ru...
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many minutes the stand worked yesterday. Yesterday, it made 13 shirts in one day, so it worked for:  13 / 8 = 1.625 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) or approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. Now let's calculate how long the stand worked today. Today, it made 3 shirts in one day, so it worked for:   3 / 8 = 0.375 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) or approximately 20 minutes. In total, the stand worked for:  1 hour and 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 1 hour and 60 minutes. Therefore, the industrial sewing machine worked for a total of 1 hour and 60 minutes.
Response:  We know that the industrial sewing machine made 9 dresses yesterday and 8 dresses today.  We also know that it can make 2 dresses per minute. So let's calculate how many minutes the machine worked yesterday and today. Yesterday, the machine made 9 dresses in total, so we divide 9 by 2 (the number of dresses it makes per minute) to get the number of minutes it worked:  9 / 2 = 4.5 minutes Today, the machine made 8 dresses in total, so we divide 8 by 2 to get the number of minutes it worked:  8 / 2 = 4 minutes Therefore, the industrial sewing machine worked for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 minutes yesterday and today combined.
Response:  Yesterday, the industrial stand made 4 rubashes in 1 minute (we know this from the problem statement). Today, it made 8 rubashes in 1 minute (again, we know this from the problem statement). So, if we divide 4 by 1 and 8 by 1, we get that the industrial stand worked for 1 minute yesterday and today. Therefore, the total number of minutes the industrial stand worked is 2 minutes (1 + 1).
Response:  First, we know that the machine made 14 ru...
Response:  Firstly, we know that the industrial sewing machine can make 6 shirts per minute. Secondly, yesterday it worked for 5 minutes and made 0 shirts (since it didn't work at all). Thirdly, today it worked for 12 minutes and made x shirts. Now let's calculate: 6 shirts/minute x 12 minutes = x shirts Total number of shirts made today = 72 shirts Therefore, the industrial sewing machine made 72 shirts today.
Response:  We know that they earned $165 in total over 5 days. That means each day they earned $33 (165 / 5). So, the daily earnings from the ring toss game were $33.
Response:  We know that the game brought in $144 per day and they were at the carnival for 22 days. So we can calculate how much money they made as follows:  144 x 22 = 3064 dollars They earned $3064 at the carnival.
"Response:  We know that the game ""Ring Toss"" earned $420 in 30 days and was one of several games at the carnival. So, if we divide $420 by the number of days it operated (30), we can find out how much it made each day:  420 / 30 = 14 per day  Now, we also know that the total earnings from all games at the carnival were $22. So, if we subtract the amount earned by ""Ring Toss"" from the total earnings, we can find out how much the other games earned:  22 - 14 = 8 per day  Therefore, the daily earnings from the ""Ring Toss"" game were $14, and the other games earned $8 per day."
Response:  We know that the game earned $382 for the first 44 days and $374 for the remaining 10 days. To find out how much they earned in total, we need to add these two amounts together.   So, the total amount earned is:  382 + 374 = 756 dollars.
"Response:  We know that in total they earned $186 dollars for all 36 days of the carnival.  In the first 20 days, they earned $120 and in the remaining 16 days, they earned $66. So we can write an equation to represent this information:  
First 20 days: $120 Second 16 days: $66 Total: $186 Now let's divide both sides of the equation by 36 (the number of days):  First 20 days per day: $\frac{120}{20} = \$6$ Second 16 days per day: $\frac{66}{16} = \$4$ Total per day: $\frac{120+66}{36} = \$7$ Therefore, they made $7 dollars per day during the first 20 days of the carnival."
"Response:  We know that the game earned $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the remaining 57 days. To find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days, we need to divide the amount earned during this period by the number of days.  
So, for the last 57 days, the game earned: 
$114 / 57 = $2 dollars per day."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cake. To find out how many more packages of cookies she bought than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the number of cookies.  10 - 4 =?  Yes, that's right! Lucy bought 6 more packs of cookies than cakes.
Response:  First, we know that Lucy bought 4 packs of cookies, and each pack contains  8 cookies. So she bought 4 x 8 = 32 cookies. Next, we know that she bought 22 packs of cake, and each pack contains 4 cakes. So she bought 22 x 4 = 88 cakes. Finally, we know that she bought 16 packs of chocolate, and each pack contains 5 pieces of chocolate. So she bought 16 x 5 = 80 pieces of chocolate. In total, Lucy bought 32 + 88 + 80 = 190 items.
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packs of cookies and some boxes of cake. The total number of packages she had was 27. So, we can start by subtracting the number of packs of cookies from the total number of packages to find out how many boxes of cake she bought:  27 - 23 =?  Now we have our answer! Lucy bought 4 boxes of cake.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lucy bought 2 packs of pies and 12 packs of cakes. We also know that she had 56 units of leftover products at the end. So let's start with the number of packs of each product she bought:  2 packs of pies x 4 pieces per pack = 8 pieces of pies 12 packs of cakes x 6 pieces per pack = 72 pieces of cakes Now, let's add up all the pieces to find out how many packs she bought in total: 8 + 72 = 80 packs Therefore, Lucy bought 80 packs of products in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 12 people in the bus initially. Then, 4 more people boarded the bus at the next stop, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. However, we cannot have more than 36 people in the bus, so we need to subtract 16 from 36:  36 - 16 = 20. Therefore, there are currently 20 people in the bus.
Response:  Firstly, there were 8 people in the bus initially. Then, 12 more people boarded the bus at the next stop, so now we have:  8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Next, 3 people got off the bus, leaving us with:  20 - 3 = 17 people currently in the bus. So, there are 17 people in the bus right now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 people in the bus, and now 13 more have boarded the bus at the stop. So, if we add 4 + 13 = 17 people are currently in the bus.
Response:  Firstly, we know that initially there were 11 people in the train.  Secondly, 8 more people boarded the train at the station. Therefore, the total number of people currently in the train is:  11 + 8 = 19.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents and in total, there were 676 people present. So, we can start by adding the number of parents to the total number of people present:  22 + 676 =?  Can you solve for the unknown value?
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. To find out how many people were present in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, the total number of people present in the program is:  73 + 724 + 744 = 1541.  Therefore, there were 1541 people present in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students in total. To find out how many more students than parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of students.  521 - 174 =?  Yes, that's right! There were 347 more students than parents in the program.
Response:  First, we know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total.  Second, we know that the program could accommodate 44 people. So, if we subtract the number of parents from the total number of participants, we get the number of students who attended the program:  61 + 177 = 238 - 61 = 177 students attended the program.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, if we subtract the depth from the total distance, we get:  1307 - 919 = 388 feet The end of the cave is 388 feet away from the entrance.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much farther they have to go based on their current depth and the total depth of the cave.  849 - 1218 = 369 feet They still need to travel 369 feet to reach the end of the cave. Next, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in this case, 369 feet), r is the rate at which they are moving (17 ft/min), and t is time. To find t, we divide the distance by the rate: 369 / 17 = 21.5 minutes So, it will take them approximately 21.5 minutes to reach the end of the cave if they continue moving at a speed of 17 ft/min.
Response:  First, we know that they have already descended to a depth of 659 feet.  To reach the end of the cave at a depth of 762 feet, they still need to descend an additional  103 feet (762 - 659 = 103).
Response:  We know that Peyj initially raised 8 goldfish in the pond and that stray cats ate 6 of them. Therefore, the number of goldfish left in the pond is:  8 - 6 = 2. So there are 2 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Peyge had 7 goldfish and 12 carp in her pond. Secondly, we are told that homeless cats began to eat the fish, but without specifying how many of them were eaten. Finally, we are given that there are now 15 remaining fish. To find out how many fish disappeared, let's subtract the number of fish left from the total number of fish initially:  7 (goldfish) + 12 (carp) = 19  19 - 15 (remaining fish) =?  So, we can see that 4 fish have disappeared.
"Response:  First, we know that Peyge raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in her pond. Next, we are told that homeless cats began to eat the fish, but without specifying how many of them did so. Finally, we learn that only two fish remain. So, let's start with the number of goldfish Peyge had:  16 Now, let's subtract the number of goldfish eaten by homeless cats:  16 - x (where ""x"" is the unknown number of goldfish eaten) = 2 We can solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:  16(16-x) = 2(16)  Simplifying and solving for ""x"":   x = 8  Therefore, 8 goldfish were eaten by homeless cats."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Peyge raised 15 goldfish in the pond and 5 were eaten by stray cats. So, how many goldfish are left? To find out, we can subtract the number of goldfish eaten from the total number of goldfish raised:  15 - 5 =?  The answer is: 10 goldfish are left in the pond.
Response:  If the chef started with 43 apples and used x to make pies, then he has 43 - x apples left. Since he has 2 apples left, we can set up the equation:  43 - x = 2. Solving for x gives us:  x = 41. So the chef used 41 apples to make his pies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chef had 58 apples and he used 35 of them to make pies. So, how many apples are left?   To find out, we can subtract the number of apples used from the total number of apples:  58 - 35 =?  Can you solve this subtraction problem and tell me the result?
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chef had 40 apples and 54 pears. After preparing some pies, he was left with 39 fruits in total. Now, let's calculate how many apples and pears he used for making pies. Since there are more apples than pears, we will start by calculating the number of apples used. We can do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples left after making pies:  40 / 39 = 1 Therefore, Chef used 1 apple for each pie. Now, let's calculate the number of pears used. We can do this by multiplying the number of pies made (which is equal to the difference between the total number of fruits and the number of fruits left) by the number of pears per pie:  54 - 39 = 15 x 2 = 30 Therefore, Chef used 30 pears for making pies. So, in total, Chef used 1 apple + 30 pears = 31 fruits to make his pies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam can place 11 toys on each shelf and there are four shelves in total. So, if we multiply 11 by 4, we get 44. Therefore, the total number of toys that can fit on all four shelves is 44.
Response:  Adam had 10 toy figures and each shelf could hold 8 toy figures. So we can start by dividing 10 by 8:  10 / 8 =? We get 1 with a remainder of 2. This means that Adam could place 2 extra toy figures on his shelves. In total, he had 2 + 8 = 10 shelves in his room.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adam can place 8 toys and 10 shelves on each shelf in his room. Secondly, there are 4 shelves in total. So, if we multiply the number of shelves (4) by the maximum number of toys he can place on each shelf (8), we get:  4 x 8 = 32  Now let's calculate the maximum number of toys he can place in his room:  32 x 4 = 128  Therefore, Adam can place a maximum of 128 toys in his room.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots. So, in total, we have:  10 x 544 = 5440 pots.  Now, we know that each pot contains 32 flowers, so the total number of flowers is:  5440 x 32 = 172800 flowers.
Response:  We know that there are 466 total number of flowerpots (gorshkov). Each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. So we can start by calculating how many flowers and sticks there are in total.   Total Number of Flowers = 466 x 53 = 24993 Total Number of Sticks = 466 x 181 = 87066 Now we need to find out how many flowers and sticks each pot has. To do this, divide the total number of flowers and sticks by the number of pots: Total Number of Flowers per Pot = 24993 / 466 = 53 Total Number of Sticks per Pot = 87066 / 466 = 181 Therefore, each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. Finally, let's calculate the total number of flowers and sticks: Total Number of Flowers = 466 x 53 = 24993 Total Number of Sticks = 466 x 181 = 87066 The answers are 24993 flowers and 87066 sticks.
Response:  We know that there are 141 flowerpots in total and each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So we can start by adding up all the flowers and sticks to get the total number of items.   Total flowers = 141 x 71 = 10,011 flowers Total sticks = 141 x 91 = 12,691 sticks Now we need to find out how many items (flowers or sticks) we have in total. Since we have more sticks than flowers, let's add up both totals to get the grand total. Grand total = Total flowers + Total sticks = 10,011 + 12,691 = 22,702 items Therefore, there are 22,702 items in total - 10,011 flowers and 12,691 sticks.
"Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in each vase and we want to find out how many vases (or ""gorshks"" as you called them) it would take to have a total of 400 flowers.   To do this, we can divide the total number of flowers (400) by the number of flowers per vase (40):  400 / 40 =?  Can you solve for x (the number of vases)?"
Response:  We know that STEVEN has 4502 CONFETES SKITTLES and 4276 STIRRER REZINKA.  To divide them into groups of 154 each, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these numbers.   First, let's calculate the total number of items: 4502 + 4276 = 8778. Now, let's divide this number by 154 (the number of items in each group): 8778 / 154 = 57.  So there will be 57 groups of 154 items each.
Response:  First, we know that Steven has 3941 lollipops in total.  Second, each group of lastikos contains 495 lollipops. So if we divide 3941 by 495, we get:  3941 / 495 =?  The result is approximately 8. We can round up to the nearest whole number, so there are 8 groups of lastikos.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and they are divided into 8 groups. So each group has:  896 / 8 = 112 Skittles per group.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, we can start by dividing 270 by 5 to find out how many classes we need:  270 / 5 = 54 So, we need 54 classes with 5 students in each class.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So we can start by multiplying 304 x 75 to find out how many students there are in total.  304 x 75 =?  Now let's simplify our calculation.  We can multiply 304 by 75 to get 22,900.  Therefore, there were 22,900 students in school altogether.
