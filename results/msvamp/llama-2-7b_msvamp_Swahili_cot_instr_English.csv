Response:  We are given that Julia has 18 days to spend with her children from Friday (Juma) until Sunday (Jumanne). She spends 10 of those days playing with them. To find out how many days she will have left after playing with them for 10 days, we subtract the number of days she spent playing with them from the total number of days available. So, the answer is: 8 days (18 - 10 = 8).
Response:  The number of children who were born in June is 12 (Jumanne). Now, let's find out how many more children were born in July compared to June. We subtract the number of children born in June from the total number of children born in July: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, there are one more child born in July than in June.
Response:  We are given that Julia has taken care of 5 children for 3 days (Juma) and another 5 children for 2 days (Jumanne). So in total she has taken care of 10 children for 5 days. Therefore, if there were 15 children in need of care, Julia would have cared for 5 of them for 5 days = 25.
Response:  We are given that Julia has taken care of 14 children for 10 days starting from Monday (Juma). If she continues taking care of them at this rate, how many children will she have taken care of after 16 days? To find out, we multiply the number of days by the number of children per day: Number of children taken care of = Total number of days x Number of children per day 16 days x 14 children/day = 224 children Therefore, Julia will have taken care of 224 children after 16 days.
"Response:  If Julia has been taking care of 16 children for 10 days (Juma to Jumanne), and she takes care of 12 more children starting from Juma to Jumanne, then the total number of children she will have taken care of is:

16 + 12 = 28
Therefore, Julia will have taken care of 28 children in total over those 10 days."
Response:  If Julia was feeding 14 children on June 14th and if she fed 8 more children than she usually feeds on Friday, which is June 20th, then she will have fed a total of 22 children (14 + 8) that week. Therefore, the answer is 22.
"Response:  We are given that there are 17 children in total and they are aged between 6 and 15 years old. So, we can calculate their ages as follows:
Watoto 17 siku ya Jumatatu = 17 x 6 = 98 years old
Watoto 15 siku ya Jumanne = 15 x 7 = 105 years old
Watoto 2 siku ya Jumatano = 2 x 3 = 6 years old
Now, let's add up all these ages to get the total age of all the children:
Total age of all children = 98 + 105 + 6 = 209 years old."
Response:  The number of children who will be in school for 15 days starting from Friday and ending on Sunday is 30 (Friday + Saturday + Sunday = 3). Since there are 7 days between Friday and Sunday, the total number of children in school during this period is 210 (3 x 7 = 21). Therefore, the answer to the question is 210.
Response:  We are given that Julia has 5 children and they are aged between 10 and 15 years old. So, we can say that there are exactly 5 children of Julia who are between the ages of 10 to 15 years old. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We are given that there are 30 children in total and they are divided into three groups of 10 each. Group 1 consists of children aged between 5-7 years old (Jumanne), group 2 consists of children aged between 8-10 years old (Jumatatu), and group 3 consists of children aged between 11-13 years old (Jumatano). Now we need to find out how many children are in each age group. So, let's count them:
Group 1 (aged between 5-7): 10 children x 2 = 20 children
Group 2 (aged between 8-10): 10 children x 2 = 20 children
Group 3 (aged between 11-13): 10 children x 1 = 10 children
Therefore, there are 20 children in each age group."
"Response:  We are given that there are 9 children in the class for 9 days of the week (Jumatatu), 7 children for 7 days of the week (Jumanne), and 96 children for 96 days of the year (Jumatano). To find out which age group has more children, we need to calculate the total number of children for each age group and compare them.
Total number of children for 9 days = 9 x 9 = 81
Total number of children for 7 days = 7 x 7 = 49
Total number of children for 96 days = 96 x 3 = 288
Now, let's compare the total numbers of children for each age group:
81 < 49 < 288
Therefore, the age group with the most children is the one for 96 days (Jumatano), with a total of 288 children."
"Response:  We are given that there are 14 children in total and they attend school for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday). So, the number of days each child attends school is:

14 children x 5 days/week = 70 days/child/week

Now, we are also given that some of these children go to school for 2 days during the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). So, the total number of days each child attends school is:

70 days/child/week + 2 days/child/weekend = 72 days/child/week

Therefore, the answer to the question is 72 days."
Response:  The number of children in the first week (Juma) is 8. In the second week (Jumanne), there are 11 children. And in the third week (Jumatano), there are 9 children. To find out which group has more children, we need to compare these numbers directly. So, the total number of children for all three weeks is: 8 + 11 + 9 = 28. Therefore, there are more children in the second week (Jumanne).
Response:  The number of children in each age group is given as follows: 15 days old (Juma), 18 days old (Jumanne), and 7 days old (Jumatano). We are asked to determine which age group has more children. To solve this problem, we can use the following formula: Total number of children = Number of children in each age group x Number of days in that age group. For example, if there are 10 children aged 15 days old, and they are present for 3 days (since 15 + 18 = 33 days), then the total number of children would be 10 x 3 = 30 children. Now let's apply this formula to each age group and calculate the total number of children accordingly: Age Group 1 (15 days old): 9 children x 4 days = 36 children Age Group 2 (18 days old): 7 children x 5 days = 35 children Age Group 3 (7 days old): 5 children x 7 days = 35 children Therefore, there are more children in Age Group 1 (36 > 35), so the answer is A) Age Group 1.
Response:  We are given that Julia has 13 children and she gave birth to 10 more in June. So, the total number of children Julia has is: 13 + 10 = 23. Now we are asked how many of these children are under the age of 15. Since July has 15 children, then the number of children who are under the age of 15 is: 15 - 23 = -8. Therefore, there are no children under the age of 15.
Response:  We are given that Julia has 7 children in total and they range from ages 7 to 13 years old. So, we can say that there are 7 + 13 = 20 children in total. Now, Julia is said to have spent Kshs 50,000 on each of her 7 children, which means she spent a total of 50,000 x 7 = Kshs 350,000 on all her children together. Therefore, the amount of money left after buying gifts for all her children is Kshs 350,000 - (Kshs 50,000 x number of children) = Kshs 350,000 - (Kshs 50,000 x 20) = Kshs 350,000 - Kshs 10,000,000 = Kshs -9,650,000.
Response:  We are given that Julia alicheza mchezo wa kukimbiza na watoto 12 siku ya Jumatatu and 14 siku ya Jumanne. So we have two instances of Julia cheating children in total. Now, we are asked how many times Julia cheated children together. To find this out, we need to add the number of times she cheated children in each instance. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 14 = 26. So, Julia cheated children together 26 times.
Response:  We are given that Julia has taken care of 19 children for 19 days in total (Juma-tatu). And she took care of 18 children for 18 days before that (Jumanne). So, we have to find out how many children Julia took care of altogether. To do this, we multiply the number of days she took care of each group of children together: 19 x 18 = 340. Therefore, there were 340 children that Julia took care of overall.
Response:  The number of days between Juma and Saturday is 2 (Juma - Saturday = 2). Therefore, the number of children who will be sick on Sunday is 3 (Sunday - Saturday = 3). So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We are given that Julia has taken care of 18 children for 4 days in a row during the week and then she took care of another 20 children for 3 days after the weekend. So, we need to find out how many children Julia took care of altogether. To do this, we can use the formula: Total number of children = Number of children per day x Number of days taken care of. In this case, the total number of children is: Total number of children = 18 x 4 + 20 x 3 = 72 Therefore, Julia took care of 72 children in total.
"Response:  We are given that Julia has taken care of children for 4 days in a week (Juma) and 6 days in a week (Jumanne). Therefore, we have:
Number of days Julia took care of children = 4 + 6 = 10 days
So, Julia took care of more than 10 days in a week."
"Response:  We are given that Bobby has 43 votes and there are 100 voters in total. So, we can calculate the percentage of votes received by Bobby as follows:

Bobby's vote percentage = (Number of votes received by Bobby / Total number of voters) x 100
= (43 / 100) x 100
= 43%
Therefore, Bobby received 43% of the total votes casted."
Response:  We are given that Bobby has 28 years old and his sister is 42 years old. So, Bobby is younger than his sister. Now we are asked how many years older is Bobby's sister compared to him. To find this out, we need to subtract their ages from each other. 63 - 28 = 35 years. Therefore, Bobby's sister is 35 years older than him.
"Response: 
Bobby alikula vipande 33 vya pipi means that there are 33 people who have been bitten by snakes in the village of Alikula.
Kisha akala vipande 4 zaidi means that there are 4 more people who have been bitten by snakes in the neighboring village of Akala.
Pia alikula vipande 14 vya chokoleti means that out of the 33 people who were bitten by snakes in Alikula, 14 of them died.
So, the total number of people who died from snakebites in both villages is:
33 (people bitten in Alikula) + 4 (people bitten in Akala) = 37
Therefore, the answer to the question is 37."
"Response: 
Bobby has 38 votes and Kisha has 36 votes. So far so good! But then comes the tricky part - Bobby got more than twice as many votes as Kisha did in the second round of voting (voting for the top two). This means that if we divide Bobby's total number of votes by two, we will get an estimate of how many votes he would have needed to win if he had only received half as many votes as Kisha did in the first round.
So, let's do the calculation:
Bobby's total votes = 38
Kisha's votes in round one = 36
Ratio of Bobby's votes to Kisha's votes in round one = 38/36 = 2
Now, if Bobby had only received half as many votes as Kisha did in round one, his total votes would be:
Bobby's total votes = 2 x 36 = 72
Therefore, Bobby would need at least 72 votes to win."
Response:  We know that Bobby had 20 pens in total and gave away 34 pens to his friend. So, he has 18 pens left with him. Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Bobby had 21 eggs in total and gave away 5 eggs to his friend. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 eggs left. Now, we are asked how many eggs more than 9 eggs Alila has. Therefore, Alila has 9 + x eggs where x is the number of eggs more than 9. Since Alila has more eggs than Bobby, x > 0. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, Alila has 9 + 7 = 16 eggs.
Response:  We are given that Bobby had 22 pens in his bag and he gave away 5 more pens to someone else. So, the number of pens Bobby has now is 22 - 5 = 17 pens. If there were 8 pens left in the bag after Bobby took them all out, then the number of pens left in the bag would be 8 / 3 = 2 pens. Therefore, the correct answer is 17 + 2 = 19 pens.
Response:  We have 19 vypandas and we took away 2 vypandas. So, there are 17 vypandas left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he gave away 20 pieces to his friends, then he has 12 pieces of candy left (32 - 20 = 12).
"Response:  We are given that there were 36 people in total and Bobby had 17 of them. So, we have to find out how many people were left after Bobby took his share.
So, the number of people left = Total number of people - Number of people taken by Bobby
= 36 - 17
= 19
Therefore, there were 19 people left after Bobby took his share."
Response:  If there were 30 students in total and each student had 5 pens, then the total number of pens would be 30 x 5 = 150 pens. So, if Bobby took all the pens, he would have taken 150 - 23 = 127 pens.
Response:  We are given that Allan has 5 marbles and Jake has 3 marbles in a basket. To find out who has more marbles, we need to compare their respective amounts of marbles. Therefore, Allan has more marbles than Jake because he has 5 marbles while Jake has only 3 marbles. So, the correct answer is 5 - 3 = 2.
"Response:  We know that Allan had two balls in his basket and Jake had three balls in his basket. So, if we want to find out how many more balls Jake had than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balls Allan had from the number of balls Jake had. Therefore, the answer is:
Jake had 3 - 2 = 1 more ball than Allan."
Response:  If Allan has 3 balls in his hand and he gives 2 of them to Jack, then how many balls does Allan have left in his hand? So, the answer is 1 ball.
Response:  If Jake can collect 6 balls in 1 minute while standing still, and he takes 4 more minutes to collect the remaining 20 balls, then how long will it take him to collect all 26 balls? Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, distance is equal to 26 balls x 1 minute per ball = 26 minutes. So, Jake will need 26/6 = 4 minutes to collect all 26 balls. Therefore, the answer is 4 minutes.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls and he gives one to Jake, then Allan has 4 balls left. If Jake already has 6 balls, then after receiving one from Allan, Jake will have 7 balls in total. So, the final number of balls that Jake will have is 7.
"Response: 
Allan has 3 balls and Jake has 5 balls in total. So, if we take away 2 balls from Allan, he will have 1 ball left. Similarly, if we take away 2 balls from Jake, he will also have 1 ball left. Therefore, both Allan and Jake have 1 ball each in common."
"Response:  We are given that Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 4 balls in total. So, if we add up all their ball counts, we get:
Allan + Jake = 2 + 4 = 6
So, Allan had more than Jake by 1 ball (i.e., 2 - 1 = 1)."
Response:  We know that Allan has 2 balls in his basket and Jake has 6 balls in his basket. If we add 3 more balls to Allan's basket, he will have how many balls in total? So, the answer is 5 (Allan + 3 = 5). Now, let's check who has more balls between Allan and Jake. Since Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 6 balls, Jake has more balls than Allan. Therefore, the correct answer is option B - Jake has more balls than Allan.
"Response: 
Allan has 5 balls and gives 2 to Jake. So now Allan has 3 balls left.
Jake has 4 balls.
So, the difference between the number of balls Allan had and the number of balls Jake had is 3 - 4 = -1 ball.
Therefore, Allan gave 1 ball less than what he had to Jake."
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 2 balls in his backpack. If Jake had more than 2 balls in his backpack, he would have told us so. So we can assume that Jake has exactly 2 balls in his backpack. Now let's calculate how many balls Allan has per bag: To do this, we divide the total number of balls (Allan has 6 + Jake has 2 = 8) by the number of bags (Allan has one bag). Therefore, Allan has an average of 8/1 = 8 balls per bag.
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balls in his basket and Jake has 3 balls in his basket. If Jake had more than 3 balls in his basket, he would have 7 or more balls. So, the number of balls Jake has is between 3 and 7 inclusive. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response: 
Jake has 5 balls and Allan has 6 balls. If Jake gives 3 of his balls to Allan, then how many balls does Allan have now?
Allan will have 9 balls (6 + 3)."
Response:  We know that Allan made 3 mistakes in 20 minutes and Jake made 5 mistakes in 59 minutes. To find out who made more mistakes, we need to divide the number of mistakes each person made by the time they took to make those mistakes. For Allan, he made 3 mistakes in 20 minutes, which means he made 0.15 mistakes per minute (3/20). For Jake, he made 5 mistakes in 59 minutes, which means he made 0.086 mistakes per minute (5/59). Now, let's compare these values: 0.086 < 0.15, so Jake made fewer mistakes than Allan. Therefore, the correct answer is Jake.
Response:  We are given that Allan alileta maballoni 7 na mipira 5 wakati and Jake alileta maballoni 6 na mipira 4 katika bustani. To find out who was in front of whom, we need to compare their speeds. Allan covered 7 miles in 5 hours, which means he traveled at a speed of 1.4 miles per hour (mph). Jake covered 6 miles in 4 hours, which means he traveled at a speed of 1.5 mph. Since Jake's speed is higher than Allan's speed, Jake was in front of Allan. Therefore, the correct answer is (Jake)
Response:  If Allan and Jake shared equally, then each of them would get 3/4 of the total amount (mangapi). So, if they shared 6, Allan would get 4 and Jake would get 2.
"Response: 
Allan has 5 balls in his basket and he gives 2 more to Jack. So now Allan has 5 + 2 = 7 balls in his basket.
Jack has 6 balls in his basket and he takes 3 more from Allan. So now Jack has 6 - 3 = 3 balls in his basket.
Therefore, the difference between the number of balls that Allan had and the number of balls that Jack had is 7 - 3 = 4 balls."
"Response:  We have been given that Kila siku (Ryan) can count up to 6 numbers in Swahili and 2 numbers in English. So, if we ask him to count how many numbers he can count in total, we will get the following calculation:
Kilimo siku (Ryan) can count up to 6 numbers in Swahili + 2 numbers in English = 8 numbers in total. Therefore, the answer is 8."
Response:  We are given that Kila has 6 days in a week and Ryan has 7 days in a week. To find out how many more days Ryan has than Kila, we need to subtract the number of days in Ryan's week from the number of days in Kila's week. So, the difference between the two is:  7 - 6 = 1 day. Therefore, Ryan has one extra day than Kila.
Response:  If Ryan can count to 10 in Swahili and he counts for 3 minutes every day, then he will have counted for a total of 3 x 21 = 63 minutes in one week. Therefore if he continues counting for 4 days, he will have counted for a total of 4 x 63 = 252 minutes.
Response:  If Ryan can solve 7 problems in 10 minutes, then he will be able to solve 2 more problems in 5 minutes (since there are 5 minutes left after solving 7 problems). Therefore, Ryan will be able to solve 9 problems in total (7 + 2 = 9).
Response:  If Ryan can count to 10 in Swahili, then he will be able to count to 50 in English. So, if Ryan can count to 50 in English, he will be able to count to 100 in Swahili. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  If Kila siku (Ryan) can do 6 tasks in 1 hour and he takes 1 hour to complete each task, then he will take 6 hours to complete all the tasks. Now if he starts working at 8 am and completes his work by 2 pm, then he has worked for 4 hours. So, the remaining time left is 4 - 4 = 0 hours. Therefore, Ryan will have completed all the tasks by 2 pm.
Response:  If Kila siku (Ryan) can do 6 tasks in 1 day and he takes 5 days to complete 30 tasks, then he will have completed 30 - 5 = 25 tasks in 6 days. Therefore, the answer is 25 tasks.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Kila siku (Ryan) has been working for 5 days and has earned $50 per day. Therefore, he has earned a total of $250 ($50 x 5 days). If he works for another 4 days, he will earn an additional $200 ($50 x 4 days), making his total earnings $450 ($250 + $200). So, if he works for 6 days in total, his total earnings will be $650 ($450 + $200).
"Response: 
Kila siku = 7 (since there are 7 days in a week)
Ryan anatumia masaa = 4 ( since he works for 4 days)
Masaa 4 kujifunza = 28 (since each day has 28 hours)
Total working hours = 28 x 4 = 112 hours
Ikiwa anajifunza kwa siku 86, anatumia masaa mangapi kila siku kujifunza Kiingereza na Kichina = 112 / 7 = 16 hours per week
Therefore, the answer is 16 hours per week."
"Response: 
Kiingereza - 6 x 10 = 60
Kichina - 7 x 10 = 70
Kihispania - 3 x 10 = 30
Therefore, the total number of days is 60 + 70 + 30 = 160 days."
Response:  We are given that there are 6 students in class A, and among them, 3 students speak Swahili. Therefore, the total number of students who do not speak Swahili is 6 - 3 = 3. Now, we are also given that there are 58 students in class B, and among them, 10 students speak Spanish. So, the total number of students who do not speak Spanish is 58 - 10 = 48. Therefore, the answer is 48.
"Response:  We have:
Kiingereza = 7 students
Kichina = 2 students
Kihispania = 4 students
We need to find out how many more students there are in Kiingereza than in Kihispania. So we subtract the number of students in Kihispania from the total number of students in Kiingereza:
7 - 4 = 3
Therefore, there are 3 more students in Kiingereza than in Kihispania."
"Response: 
Kila siku = 7 days (Ryan)
Masaa 2 kujifunza = 14 days (Kiingereza)
Masaa 5 kujifunza = 70 days (Kichina)
Masaa 4 kujifunza = 32 days (Kihispania)
To find out how many more days Kichina has than Kihispania, we subtract their number of days from each other:
70 - 32 = 38 days
Therefore, Kichina has 38 more days than Kihispania."
"Response:  If it takes 3 days for Ryan to count 100 birds in Kiunga using Kiingereza language, and he counts 2 birds every day, how many birds will Ryan have counted after 5 days?
So, if Ryan has counted 2 birds per day, then he will have counted a total of 4 birds (2 x 2 = 4) after 2 days. Therefore, after 5 days, he will have counted a total of 8 birds (4 x 2 = 8)."
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan can speak Kiingereza in 7 days and Kichina in 5 days. So, if he spends one day speaking each language, then his total time spent speaking both languages is:
Masaa = (Kiingereza + Kichina) / 2 = (7 + 5) / 2 = 12 days
Therefore, the number of days it will take for Ryan to learn both Kiingereza and Kichina is 12 days."
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 8 pencils and gave away 3 of them. Then she was left with 5 pencils. Now we are asked how many pencils Tiffany would have if she gives away 2 more pencils after giving away 3 pencils. So, in total, Tiffany will give away 5 + 2 = 7 pencils. Therefore, Tiffany will be left with 8 - 7 = 1 pencil.
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 7 pencils and she used up 4 of them in one day. Therefore, she has 7 - 4 = 3 pencils left. Now we are asked how many more pencils Tiffany will have after 5 days. So, if Tiffany uses up 4 pencils per day, then she will use up 4 x 5 = 20 pencils in total over 5 days. Hence, Tiffany will have 3 - 20 = -17 pencils after 5 days.
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 10 marbles in her pocket initially and she gave 4 of them to Jackie. So, Tiffany has 10 - 4 = 6 marbles left. Now, we are asked how many marbles Tiffany will have after 6 days if she gives 2 marbles per day. Therefore, Tiffany will give 2 x 6 = 12 marbles away in total during those 6 days, leaving her with 6 - 12 = -6 marbles (a negative number indicates that she will have fewer marbles).
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 12 beads in her pocket and she gave 4 beads to Jackie. So, Tiffany has 8 beads left. Now, we are asked how many beads Jackie has if he received 4 beads from Tiffany. Therefore, Jackie has 4 beads.
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 10 marbles initially and gave away 3 marbles in one day. Therefore, she has 7 marbles left after giving them away for 3 days. So, the number of marbles Tiffany has now is 7.
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 8 babies and she gave birth to 2 more after 3 months. So, in total, Tiffany had 10 babies. After 3 months, she gave birth to another baby, so now she has 11 babies. Therefore, the answer is (D) 11.
Response:  We are given that Tiffany had 100 beads in total and she gave away 3 beads to her friend. So, Tiffany has 97 beads left. Now, we are told that Juma took 7 beads from Tiffany and gave them back to her after taking 44 beads from Chupa. Therefore, the number of beads that Juma took from Chupa is 44 - 7 = 37 beads.
"Response:  The number of bananas in the basket is 17 and there are 16 bananas in the box. So, if we subtract the number of bananas in the box from the number of bananas in the basket, we get:  
17 - 16 = 1
Therefore, there are one more banana in the basket than in the box."
Response:  We are given that there are 5 fruits in the basket and 11 fruits in the bag. So, we have to find out how many more fruits are in the bag than in the basket. To do this, we need to subtract the number of fruits in the basket from the number of fruits in the bag. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 6 (11 - 5). So, there are 6 more fruits in the bag than in the basket.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 peaches in total and we want to know how many peaches are left after 5 have been eaten. So, if 5 peaches have been eaten, then the number of remaining peaches is equal to 10 - 5 = 5. Therefore, the number of peaches left after 5 have been eaten is 5.
Response:  We are given that there are 3 types of fruits in the market, and each type has 10 more fruits than those in the forest. So, if we have X fruits in the forest, then we will have X + 10 (X x 10/3) fruits in the market. Therefore, the number of fruits in the market is 3 times the number of fruits in the forest.
Response:  We have 7+15=22. Now we subtract 8 from 22 which gives us 14. So the answer is 14.
Response:  We are given that there are 7 bananas in one bunch and each bunch has 3-4 fruits. So, we can say that there are 7 x 3 = 21 bananas in total. Now, let's consider the number of mangoes. There are 71 mangoes in one basket and each basket contains 5-6 fruits. Therefore, the total number of mangoes is 71 x 5 = 355 mangoes. Finally, regarding pineapples, there are 8 pineapples in one bunch and each bunch contains 3-4 fruits. Thus, the total number of pineapples is 8 x 3 = 24 pineapples. So, the correct answer is 21 + 355 + 24 = 600 fruit.
Response:  We are given that there are 2 ya rangi (yards) in length of kuna matunda and 6 ya rangi (yards) in length of rangi ya manjano. Also, we are told that there are 14 ya rangi (yards) in length of rangi ya kijani. Now, let's find out how many ya rangi (yards) are in total length of all these objects combined. So, we have: Total length = Length of kuna matunda + Length of rangi ya manjano + Length of rangi ya kijani =  2 + 6 + 14 = 22 ya rangi (yards). Therefore, the answer is 22 ya rangi (yards).
Response:  We have 19 fruits in total (matunda). Out of these, 11 are bananas and 12 are mangoes. So, we can say that the number of fruits that are more than bananas is 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We are given that there are 6 bananas and 90 apples in total. From this information, we can calculate the number of oranges as follows: Number of oranges = Total number of fruits / Number of bananas x Number of apples So, Number of oranges = (6 + 90) / 6 x 90 = 270 oranges. Therefore, there are 270 oranges in total.
"Response: 
Rangi nyekundu = 18
Rangi ya manjano = 14
Rangi ya kijani = 17
Total number of fruits = Rangi nyekundu + Rangi ya manjano + Rangi ya kijani = 18 + 14 + 17 = 59
Therefore, the total number of fruits in the basket is 59."
Response:  We have 5 bananas and we want to share them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 1 1/2 bananas (5 / 4 = 1 1/2). Now let's consider the apples. If there are 14 apples and we want to distribute them equally among 6 people, then each person will get 2 1/3 apples (14 / 6 = 2 1/3). Finally, if there are 6 oranges and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people, then each person will get 1 1/2 oranges (6 / 4 = 1 1/2). Therefore, the total number of fruits that each person will receive is: 1 1/2 + 2 1/3 + 1 1/2 = 5 1/3 fruits per person.
"Response:  We are given that there are 65 peaches in total and each peach weighs 0.2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all peaches is:
65 x 0.2 = 13 kg
Now, we are asked how many peaches are there in 7 baskets. Since each basket can hold 3 peaches, the number of peaches in 7 baskets is:
7 x 3 = 21 peaches
Therefore, the answer to the question is 21 peaches."
Response:  We are given that there are 10 peaches in total and each peach weighs 18 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all peaches is: 10 x 18 = 180 grams. So, the answer is 180 grams.
Response:  We are given that there are 6 vya matunda (peaches) in total and each peach has 16 pieces inside it. Therefore, the total number of pieces of peaches is: 6 x 16 = 96. So, the answer is 96.
Response:  We are given that there are 7 vya matunda (peaches) in total and each peach weighs 1 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all peaches is 7 x 1 kg = 7 kg. Now, we are asked how many peaches there are for every 10 kg of peaches bought by Kijani. So, if Kijani buys 10 kg of peaches, then he will get 1/10 = 0.1 peaches. Therefore, the number of peaches Kijani gets for every 10 kg of peaches he buys is 0.1 peaches.
Response:  We are given that there are 4 birds per tree and each bird eats 3 fruits per day. Therefore, the total number of fruits consumed by all birds in one day is: 4 x 3 = 12 fruits/day. Since there are 7 trees in total, the total number of fruits consumed by all birds in one day is: 12 fruits/tree x 7 trees = 84 fruits/day. So, the answer to the question is 84 fruits/day.
Response:  We are given that there are 12 peaches in total and each box contains 4 peaches. Therefore, we can calculate the number of boxes as follows: Number of boxes = Total number of peaches / Number of peaches per box = 12 / 4 = 3 boxes. So, there are 3 boxes of peaches.
Response:  We have 16 apples in total and we want to know how many are more than half of them. So, let's divide 16 by 2 (half) = 8. Therefore, there are 8 apples that are more than half of the total number.
Response:  We are given that there are 19 peaches in total and we want to know how many will be left after 4 people have eaten some of them. So, let's assume each person has eaten x number of peaches. Since there were initially 19 peaches, if 4 people eat some of them, then the remaining peaches will be equal to 19 - (x/4). Therefore, if 4 people eat 7 peaches each, the remaining peaches will be 19 - (7/4) = 8.
Response:  We have 10 balls in total and we want to know how many of them are red. If there are 4 blue balls and 6 green balls, then the number of red balls is 10 - (4 + 6) = 10 - 10 = 0. Therefore, none of the 10 balls are red.
Response:  We have 6 bananas in total (matunda 6). Out of these, we have 3 that are ripe and ready to eat (matunda 6 ya rangi ya kijani), which is equal to 1/2 or 0.5 of the total number of bananas. Now, out of the remaining 3 unripe bananas (matunda 6 ya rangi ya manjano), we have 2 that are almost ripe (matunda 2 ya rangi ya nyekundu katika kikapu), which is equal to 0.4 of the total number of unripe bananas. Therefore, the proportion of ripe bananas among all the bananas in the basket is 0.5, while the proportion of almost-ripe bananas is 0.4.
Response:  If Jerry had 4 things to do at home and he finished them all, then he has nothing left to do. So, if we assume that there are 8 things to do in total at home (which is an arbitrary number), then Jerry would have completed 4/8 = 0.5 or half of them. Therefore, he still has 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 things left to do at home.
Response:  If Jerry had 50 balls in total and he gave away 7 of them to his friends, then he has 43 balls left (50 - 7 = 43). Now, if he gives away another 3 balls to his friends, he will have 40 balls left (43 - 3 = 40). So, the final number of balls that Jerry has after giving away all 10 balls is 40.
"Response:  Jerry had 4 books to read and he finished reading them in 22 days. If he reads at a rate of 6 books per day, then the number of days it will take him to finish reading all the books is:

Number of days = Total number of books / Reading speed
= 4 + 22 = 26

Therefore, Jerry will need approximately 26 days to finish reading all the books."
Response:  According to the question, Jerry had 5 books and gave away 3 of them. So he has 2 books left. Now, he is given 7 more books to give away. To find out how many books Jerry will have after giving all these books away, we need to subtract the number of books he already has from the total number of books he was given. Therefore, the final answer is: 2 - 7 = -5 books.
Response:  The number of people who have chewed gum at least once in their lives is 200 (vitabu 10). If we want to know how many more people have chewed gum than those who haven't, we subtract the number of non-gum chewers from the total number of gum chewers. So, the difference between the two groups is 400 (vitabu 4) since there are 4 times as many gum chewers as non-gum chewers. Therefore, the percentage of people who have chewed gum is 4/5 or 80%.
Response:  Jerry had 8 books to read and he finished reading them in 3 days. If he reads at a constant rate of 2 books per day, then he will finish reading all the remaining 10 books in 5 days (3 + 5 = 8). So, the total number of days it took Jerry to finish reading all the 18 books is 8 days.
Response:  The number of books Jerry has read is 7 and he wants to know how many more books he needs to read to reach 100 books. So, we need to find out how many books he needs to read to reach 93 (which is 100 - 7). To do this, we divide the difference between 100 and 7 by 4, which gives us 22.5 books. Since you can't have a fraction of a book, Jerry needs to read 23 books more to reach his goal of reading 100 books.
Response:  If Jerry had 5 books to read and he finished reading them in 2 days, then he would have read 1 book per day. Therefore, if he reads at this rate for 3 more days (i.e., 9 days total), he will have read a total of 9 books.
"Response:  Jerry had 8 tasks to complete in his workplace and he completed 4 more than the required number of tasks within a given time frame (vitulo). Therefore, if we calculate the total number of tasks Jerry completed using the formula below; Total Number Of Tasks = Completed Tasks + Excess Tasks - Required Number Of Tasks Subtracted From The Excess Tasks Total Number Of Tasks = 8 + 4 - 2 = 10 So Jerry completed 10 tasks in total."
Response:  If Jerry had 3 things to do yesterday and he completed them all, then today he has 0 things to do because he finished everything. Now let's assume that tomorrow he will have 4 new things to do. So far so good! But if we keep adding up the number of things he needs to do each day, we get: 0 + 4 = 4 for today, 4 + 5 = 9 for tomorrow, 9 + 7 = 16 for the next day, and so on... Therefore, after 6 days, Jerry would have a total of 6 x 7 = 42 things to do!
Response:  If Jerry had 7 items in his bag and he gave away 3 of them, then he has 4 items left in his bag. Now, if he gives away another item, he will have 3 items left in his bag. Therefore, the final number of items Jerry has after giving away all 10 items is 3.
Response:  If there are 10 people in total and each person has an average of 2 bags of maize per week, then the total number of bags of maize that will be collected is 10 x 2 = 20 bags per week. Now, if Jerry collects 5 bags more than the total number of bags collected by all the other people, then he collects 20 + 5 = 25 bags of maize per week. Therefore, Jerry collects 25 bags of maize per week.
Response:  We are given that Jerry had 9 books to give away and he gave away 7 of them. So, we have 9 - 7 = 2 remaining books with Jerry. Now, let's assume there were 10 books in total (including the ones Jerry already gave away) and we want to know how many books Jerry has left after giving away 7. Therefore, the number of books Jerry has left is 10 - 7 = 3.
"Response: 
Jerry had 3 books and gave away 4 to his friend. So he has 3 - 4 = 1 book left with him.
Now, if he gives away 2 more books to another friend, then he will have 1 - 2 = 0 books left with him.
Therefore, the number of books Jerry has left with him after giving away 2 more books is 0."
Response:  We are given that Jerry had 7 books and he gave away 3 of them to his friend. So, he has 4 books left (7 - 3 = 4). Now, we are asked how many more books Jerry would have if he gives away 2 more books than he already gave away. Therefore, the number of books Jerry will give away is 2 + 3 = 5. So, after giving away 5 books, Jerry will be left with 4 - 5 = -1 book. However, since we cannot have negative numbers of books, the correct answer is 0 books.
Response:  The number of eggs that were cracked initially was 6. If 3 more eggs are added to the same container after some have been broken, then the total number of eggs in the container will be 9 (6 + 3). So, the number of eggs left uneaten is 9 - 6 = 3.
Response:  We have 5 birds perched on a tree branch in total (uzio). If we remove 2 birds from the branch, there will be 3 birds left (jumla ya ndege 3). So, if we add another bird to the branch, there will be 4 birds in total (ndege 4). Therefore, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  We are given that there are 46 people who have not taken their medication as prescribed and we need to find out how many of them will take it after being counseled. From the question, we can see that 6 more people will take their medication after being counseled. Therefore, the number of people who will take their medication after being counseled is 46 + 6 = 52.
Response:  We are given that there are 3 birds and they can carry 2 bags each. So in total, we have 6 bags (3 x 2 = 6). Now, we are asked how many bags will be left after 5 of the birds have flown away. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of bags carried by the 5 flying birds from the total number of bags available. Therefore, the answer is 6 - 10 = -4 bags.
"Response:  We have three birds (Kuna) and four dogs (marabu). If we subtract two more birds from the total number of birds, then the remaining number will be equal to the total number of dogs minus one. Therefore, the answer is:
Ndege 3 - 2 = 1
So, there are one dog less than the total number of birds."
Response:  We have 6 people in total (marabu). Each person has eaten 2 pieces of meat (ndege), so altogether they have eaten 12 pieces of meat (6 x 2 = 12). Now we are asked how many more pieces of meat each person would need to eat if there were 3 more people (ndege 3 zaidi) than the original number (ndege 2 zaidi). To find out, we simply subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 12 - 9 = 3. So each additional person would need to eat 3 more pieces of meat. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We are given that there are 4 people who have not eaten anything and they want to share food equally among themselves. So, each person will get 1/4 of the total food. Now, we are also given that there are 6 people in total including the 4 who haven't eaten anything yet. Therefore, the total amount of food available is 6 x 1/4 = 3/4. Since 3/4 is less than 2, the remaining food (2 - 3/4) will be shared among the 2 people who have already eaten something. So, each of them will get 1/2 of the remaining food.
Response:  We have 3 birds (Kuna) and they are eating 4 fish (marabu). If we add 6 more fish to the equation, how many will be left for each bird? So, the answer is 4/3 = 1.33 fish per bird.
Response:  We have 6 people who are not married and want to get married. From these 6 people, 3 of them will definitely marry each other. So, the number of people left without a spouse is 6 - 3 = 3. Now, out of these remaining 3 people, 2 more will definitely marry each other, leaving only one person without a spouse. Therefore, the final answer is 1.
Response:  We have 4 people who are not wearing masks and they are in contact with 12 people who are wearing masks. So, the total number of people in contact is 12 + 4 = 16. Now, out of these 16 people, 6 are wearing masks, so the remaining 10 people (16 - 6) are not wearing masks. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We have 6 birds and each bird lays 5 eggs. So we have a total of 6 x 5 = 30 eggs. Now, out of these 30 eggs, 4 are broken. So we have 30 - 4 = 26 eggs left. Therefore, there are 26 eggs remaining after 4 eggs are broken.
Response:  The number of eggs that were not broken is 5 more than the number of eggs that were broken. So if 4 eggs were broken, then 5 - 4 = 1 egg was not broken. Therefore, there was one unbroken egg.
Response:  We have three birds and six birds in total. The second group of birds has more than five birds (marabu). So, we can say that there are at least six birds in the second group. Therefore, the number of birds in the first group is less than six. In other words, the difference between the number of birds in the two groups is greater than zero but less than six. Thus, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  The number of birds that can fit in a basket is 5. If there are 3 birds already in the basket, then we have space for 2 more birds. Therefore, the maximum number of birds that can fit in the basket is 7 (5 + 2). So, the answer is 7.
Response:  The number of birds that can fit in a tree is directly proportional to its diameter. So if we assume an average bird size of 0.5 meters and an average tree diameter of 3 meters, then approximately 6 birds can fit inside the tree (6/0.5 = 12). However, this calculation assumes all birds are equally spaced around the tree trunk, which may not be realistic. Therefore, I would give a more conservative estimate of 4 birds per tree (4/0.5 = 8).
Response:  We have 3 birds that can fly at a time and each bird can carry 2 eggs. So in total we have 3 x 2 = 6 eggs carried by the birds. Now let's assume that there are more than 6 birds flying together. If there are n birds flying together, then each bird will carry n/6 eggs on average since they all want to carry equal loads. Therefore, the number of eggs carried by all the birds is (n/6) x 6 = n x 6 eggs. Since n is a positive integer greater than 6, the resultant number of eggs carried by all the birds is always greater than 6.
Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7. Therefore, the number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is 28 - 7 = 21. Similarly, the number of verses in Surah Al-Nisa' is 60 - 7 = 53. Finally, the number of verses in Surah Al-Muddaththir is 74 - 7 = 67. So, the difference between the number of verses in Surah Al-Kwanza and Surah Al-Pili is 67 - 21 = 46.
Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7. Therefore, the number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is greater than 7. Similarly, the number of verses in Surah Al-Nisa is also greater than 7. So, the answer is (A) Surah Al-Nisa has more verses than Surah Al-Baqarah.
Response:  According to the question, the book has 60 pages and each page contains 93 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is 60 x 93 = 5460 words.
"Response:  According to the question, we have:
Sura = 2 (as given)
Kurasa = 36 (as given)
Jumla = 67 (as given)
Now, let's find out how many verses are there in Surah Al-Furqan which is the second Surah of the Quran. As per the question, it has 75 Verses. So, the answer is:
Number of verses in Surah Al-Furqan = 75"
"Response:  The number of chapters in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7, so it has the code ""1"". For Surah Al-Baqarah, there are 286 verses, which corresponds to the code ""35"". Similarly, for Surah Ali-Imran, there are 206 verses, corresponding to the code ""24"". Therefore, the total number of chapters in the Quran is 7 + 35 + 24 = 66. So, the answer is 66."
Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7, and the number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is 8. Therefore, the total number of verses between these two surahs is 7 + 8 = 15. So, the number of verses in Surah Al-Kafirun that comes after Surah Al-Baqarah is 15 - 2 = 13.
"Response:  The three suras are:
Sura 1 = Surah Al-Fatihah (1)
Sura 2 = Surah Al-Baqarah (30)
Sura 3 = Surah Ali-Imran (3)
Now let's compare their lengths:
Sura 1 has 7 verses (ayah).
Sura 2 has 286 verses (ayah).
Sura 3 has 3 verses (ayah).
Therefore, the length of the third sura is shorter than the second sura by a factor of:
(286 - 3) / 3 = 95
So, the answer to your question is 95."
Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7, so the number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is 89 - 7 = 82. Therefore, the number of verses in Surah Al-Nisa is 60 - 82 = 18.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 verses. Therefore, the total number of verses in the book is 31 x 61 = 1861 verses.
Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Fatihah is 7 ayat (verses). Therefore, the number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is 2 x 7 = 14 ayat.
"Response:  The number of verses in Surah Al-Baqarah is 81. To find out how many times ""kitab"" appears in this surah, we need to divide the total number of verses (81) by the number of occurrences of ""kitab"". So, the answer is 81/3 = 27. Therefore, the number of times ""kitab"" appears in Surah Al-Baqarah is 27."
Response:  We have 62 people who will be walking in the morning and 39 people who will walk in the afternoon. To determine which group has walked more, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each group. For the morning walkers, the distance is 10 km x 62 = 620 km. For the afternoon walkers, the distance is 10 km x 39 = 390 km. Therefore, the group that walked more is the morning walkers with a total distance of 620 km.
Response:  We are given that Wapiga has 52 cows and he wants to sell them at Kshs 300 per cow. He also has 61 cows which he wants to sell at Kshs 400 per cow. To find out how much more money Wapiga will make from selling the additional 61 cows than he would have made if he had sold all his 52 cows at Kshs 300 per cow, we need to calculate the total amount of money Wapiga will make from both sets of sales. The total amount of money Wapiga will make is calculated below: Total amount = (Number of cows x Selling price per cow) For the first set of cows (52), the total amount is: Total amount = (52 x Kshs 300) = Kshs 16,200 For the second set of cows (61), the total amount is: Total amount = (61 x Kshs 400) = Kshs 24,400 Now, let's compare the amounts: Kshs 16,200 - Kshs 24,400 = Kshs 8,200 So, Wapiga will make an extra Kshs 8,200 by selling the additional 61 cows at Kshs 400 per cow instead of selling all his 52 cows at Kshs 300 per cow. Therefore, the answer is Kshs 8,200.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 children who go to school in the morning and 32 children who go to school in the afternoon. So, if we want to know how many children go to school in total, we can simply add these two numbers together:  15 + 32 = 47. Therefore, there are 47 children who go to school in total.
Response:  If there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours, then we have a total of 168 hours in a week (7 x 24 = 168). Now, if we subtract the number of hours spent sleeping per day (which is assumed to be 8), we get the remaining hours available for other activities such as work, study, leisure, etc. So, the answer would be 150 hours (168 - 8 = 150).
Response:  We have 36 + 13 = 49 people who went to work in the morning and returned at noon. So, there are 49 people who worked during the daytime (jioni).
Response:  The number of campers who went to Kuchota Maiji in the morning is 44. Then, 39 campers went to Kuchota Maji in the afternoon. Finally, 31 campers went to Kuchota Maji in the evening. Therefore, the total number of campers who went to Kuchota Maji is 44 + 39 = 83 campers. So, there are more than 31 campers who went to Kuchota Maji in the evening.
Response:  The number of campers who went to Kuchota Maiji in the morning is 53. The number of campers who went to Kuchota Maiji in the afternoon is 48. Therefore, the total number of campers who went to Kuchota Maiji is 53 + 48 = 101 campers. So, there are more than 49 campers who went to Kuchota Maji jioni (or in the evening).
"Response:  We are given that there are 33 students who passed their exams and got scholarships, and among them, 34 students failed to get scholarships. Now we need to find out how many students did not pass their exams. To do this, we will subtract the number of students who got scholarships from the total number of students. So, the answer is:
Watermelon 33 - Watermelon 34 = 10
Therefore, 10 students did not pass their exams."
Response:  We are given that there are 13 people who will end their journey at 5 am and 59 people who will start their journey at 6 am. Therefore, the total number of people who will be traveling is 13 + 59 = 72.
Response:  We are given that there are 29 wapiga kambi who want to go for a safari and they can only take 66 wapiga kambi with them. This means that 37 wapiga kambi (29 - 66) will not be able to join the safari. Therefore, the answer is 37.
Response:  We have 41 students who will be taking exams and we want to know how many of them will pass. From the information given, 26 students passed their previous examinations. So, the probability of passing for each student is 26/41 or 0.63 (or 63%).
Response:  The number of campers who walked to the swimming pool is 46. Out of these, 43 campers went for a swim and 7 did not go for a swim. So, the number of campers who did not go for a swim is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If there are 4 people in total and each person has to eat for 3 days, then the number of meals required is: 4 x 3 = 12 meals. Since there are only 7 meals available, we will have to ration them among the four people as follows: 12/4 = 3 meals per person. Therefore, each person will get 3 meals.
Response:  We know that there are four eggs in total and two of them have been cracked already. So, we have 4 - 2 = 2 remaining uncracked eggs. Now, let's assume that Rachel has taken one egg from the basket. So, after she took it, we have 2 - 1 = 1 remaining uncracked egg left in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We are given that Rachel has 7 apples and she gives 5 of them to her friend. Now, if we assume that each apple represents 2 people (as in, one apple can feed two people), then...
Response:  We are given that Rachel has 2 apples and she gives 1 to her friend. Now there are 2 apples left with Rachel. Then, we are told that Mama has 7 apples and she gives 3 to Rachel. So now, Rachel has 5 apples (2 + 3 = 5). Finally, we are asked how many apples Mama has after giving 3 apples to Rachel. Since Mama had 7 apples initially and gave 3 to Rachel, Mama now has 4 apples (7 - 3 = 4) remaining. Therefore, the answer is 5 for Rachel and 4 for Mama.
Response:  We are given that there are six people in total and each person has either one or two bags. So, we have a total of 6 + (1 bag per person) = 7 bags. Now, out of these seven bags, four bags contain milk. Therefore, the number of bags containing milk is 4/7 = 0.57. Since you cannot be more than half of something, the number of bags containing milk must be an integer. So, the answer is 3 bags contain milk.
Response:  We are given that Rachel scored 3 points in her first exam and got 27 points in her second exam. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can add the number of points she scored in both exams: 3 + 27 = 30. So, Rachel scored 30 points in total.
Response:  We are given that Rachel had 7 apples and she gave 2 to her friend. So now Rachel has 5 apples left. Then, she got 3 more apples, so now she has 8 apples in total. Therefore, the correct answer is (8).
"Response: 
Rachel had 20 eggs in her basket initially. She gave 5 eggs to her friend. So, she has 20 - 5 = 15 eggs left.
Now, she gives 3 more eggs to another person. So, she has 15 - 3 = 12 eggs left.
Therefore, there are 12 eggs remaining in Rachel's basket after giving away 5 and then 3 eggs."
Response:  We are given that Rachel has 52 apples and she gives 2 to her friend who then shares them equally among 7 of his friends. So, each of Rachel's friend will get 3 apples (2/7). Now, let's find out how many apples Rachel has left after giving some away. Rachel had 52 apples initially and gave 2 to her friend, so she now has 52 - 2 = 50 apples left.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 8 apples in a basket and after some time, 4 more apples were added to it, making the total number of apples 12 (8 + 4). Now, we are asked how many apples are left in the basket after another 5 minutes have passed. Since the rate at which apples are picked is constant, we can assume that the same number of apples will be picked every 5 minutes. Therefore, if 12 apples were picked in the first 5 minutes, then 6 apples will be picked in each subsequent 5-minute interval (since the rate remains constant). So, after 10 more 5-minute intervals, there will be 6 x 10 = 60 apples left in the basket. Finally, since the last 5-minute interval took place just now, there are currently 60 apples left in the basket.
Response:  We are given that Rachel has picked 7 apples from each of the 10 trees. Therefore, she has picked a total of 7 x 10 = 70 apples. Now we are asked how many apples Rachel will have if she picks another 30 apples. So, the total number of apples Rachel will have is 70 + 30 = 100 apples.
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more bullets than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 19 bullets and Doug had x bullets, we can write the equation: Ed = Doug + 2. Now, we are told that Doug has fewer bullets than Ed now. So, we can set up another equation: Doug - x = 19. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 17 (Doug had 17 fewer bullets than Ed). Therefore, Doug had 17 - 2 = 15 bullets left after Ed used his last bullet.
Response:  If Ed had 10 more bananas than Doug, then he has 10 + 11 = 21 bananas in total. Since Ed had 45 bananas initially and now has 21 additional bananas, his new total number of bananas is 45 + 21 = 66 bananas. So, Ed has 66 bananas more than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 6 more than Doug, then Ed has 6 + x = 38 and Doug has 7 + y = 45. Since Ed has 22, we can set up the equation: 6 + x = 22. Solving for x, we get x = 16. So, Doug has 7 + (45 - 16) = 39.
Response:  We know that Ed has 5 more bullets than Doug. So, if Doug has x bullets, then Ed has x + 5 bullets. Since Ed had 27 bullets in total, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 5) = 27. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 5 = 27. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us: 2x = 22. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 11. Therefore, Doug had 11 bullets.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more bullets than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 36 bullets now and Doug has 27 bullets, then we can say that Ed gained 9 extra bullets from Doug (36 - 27 = 9). Therefore, Ed had 9 more bullets than Doug at the end of the fight.
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 bullets left after shooting 17 of them during the game. So, if he shot more bullets, then he must have had fewer bullets left. Therefore, Ed had 12 bullets left after shooting additional bullets (29 - 17 = 12).
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more bullets than Doug initially. So, if Ed now has 8 more bullets than Doug, then Ed initially had 27 (19 + 8) bullets more than Doug. Therefore, Ed initially had 27 - 8 = 19 more bullets than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 30 more bananas than Doug, and he gave away 21 of them, then Ed has 59 bananas left (30 + 21 = 59). Now, if Ed originally had 91 bananas, that means he had 91 - 59 = 32 more bananas than Doug initially. So, at the time when Ed had 91 bananas, he had 32 more bananas than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 12 more than Doug, and he had 20 items in total, then Doug must have had 8 less than Ed (since 20 - 12 = 8). So if Ed had 17 items initially, then Doug must have started with 9 (since 17 - 8 = 9).
Response:  The number of students in class 408 is given as 408 and they are required to prepare a menu for 50 people. Therefore, we need to divide 408 by 50 to get the number of dishes each student needs to prepare. So, the answer is 8 (408/50 = 8).
Response:  If there are 479 students who can cook and they have to prepare lunch for themselves, then each student will need to prepare food for approximately 1/479 of the total number of students, which is 10 (since 479 x 10 = 4790). Therefore, if 489 students cannot cook, then each non-cooking student will need to purchase food from those who can cook, resulting in an additional demand of approximately 9 more meals (since 489 - 479 = 9). So, the total number of meals required would be 19 (10 + 9), assuming that all non-cooking students want to buy food from those who can cook.
Response:  The total number of students in class 310 is 310. Out of these, 185 students did not eat lunch and 125 students ate lunch. Therefore, the number of students who ate Nyama ya Nguruwe is 125. So, the answer is 125.
Response:  The number of students who took part in cooking competition is 288 and they prepared different dishes. Out of these, 264 students were able to prepare bacon, while 14 students could not. Therefore, the number of students who could not prepare bacon is 14. So, the answer is 14.
Response:  The number of students who prefer to eat meat is 457 and they will take 10 minutes per day to prepare their meals. Therefore, in one week (7 days), each student will spend 7 x 10 = 70 minutes preparing their meals. Now, let's calculate how many hours each student will spend preparing their meals in a month (30 days). We have: 70 minutes/day x 30 days = 2100 minutes/month. Finally, we divide this value by the total number of students (63) to get the average time spent by each student preparing their meals per month: 2100 minutes/month / 63 students = 33.8 minutes/student/month.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 182. Number of students who prefer to eat meat = 104 (since 104 students out of 182 preferred to eat meat). Therefore, the number of students who do not prefer to eat meat = Total - Preferred number = 182 - 104 = 78. So, among the remaining 78 students, 53 students did not prefer to eat meat.
Response:  The number of students who took the exam is 324. Out of these, 374 scored below average in cooking, while 128 scored above average. Therefore, the total number of students who passed the exam is:  324 - (374 x 0.6) = 259. So, 259 students passed the exam.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 257. Number of students who prefer to eat meat = 120. Number of students who prefer to eat fish = 97. Therefore, the number of students who prefer to eat vegetables is 40 (257 - 120 - 97).
Response:  The total number of students in class = 144. Number of students who prefer to eat meat = 467. Number of students who do not want to eat meat = 79. Therefore, the number of students who will eat vegetables is (467 - 79) = 388.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 228 + 337 + 23 = 588. Therefore, more than half (588/2) of the students are eating meat, while less than half (588/4) are not eating meat.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 450 + 38 = 488. Therefore, the percentage of students who passed with flying colors (90-100%) is: (488 x 100)/488 = 100%.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 218 + 351 = 569. So, out of these students, 218 will eat bacon and 351 will not eat bacon. Therefore, the percentage of students who will eat bacon is (218/569) x 100% = 38.7%.
Response:  The total number of students in class = 269 + 330 + 76 = 675. So, there are more than 600 students who prefer to eat meat (269+330=599).
"Response:  We are given that Shuleni has 569 students and Wavulani has 236 students. To find out how many more students Wavulani has than Shuleni, we need to subtract the number of students in Wavulani from the number of students in Shuleni. So, the answer is:
Wavulani has 133 more students than Shuleni (569 - 236 = 133)."
Response:  We are given that there are 34 students in class 841 and we want to find out how many more students than the teacher has. So, let T be the number of students taught by the teacher. Since the teacher teaches all the students in class 841, we can write T = 34. Now, we need to find out how many more students the teacher teaches than the total number of students in class 841. Therefore, the difference between T and 34 is equal to the number of students taught by the teacher minus the total number of students in class 841. This gives us D = T - 34 = 0. Hence, the teacher teaches zero more students than the total number of students in class 841.
Response:  We have 485 students and 232 teachers. To find out how many students are left without a teacher, we need to subtract the number of teachers from the total number of students. So, the answer is (485 - 232) = 253 students who do not have a teacher.
Response:  We are given that there were 697 students in total and 228 more passed than failed. So, if we subtract the number of failures (228) from the total number of students (697), we get the number of passes: 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there were 469 students who passed their exams.
Response:  We are given that there were 635 students in class 635 and 510 of them passed their exams. To find out how many did not pass, we can subtract the number of those who passed from the total number of students. So, the number of students who did not pass is:  635 - 510 = 125. Therefore, 125 students did not pass their exams.
Response:  We are given that there were 868 students in total and 281 more passed than failed. So, the number of students who passed is equal to 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, there were 587 students who passed the examination.
"Response:  We are given that there were 700 students in total and 142 more than half of them passed. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of passing students + Half of total students (since 142 is more than half)
Total number of students = 700 + (700 / 2)
Total number of students = 700 + 350
Total number of students = 1050
Therefore, there were 1050 students who took the examination."
Response:  We are given that there were 706 students in class 7 and 222 of them passed. So, the number of students who did not pass is 706 - 222 = 484. Therefore, there are 484 students left in school after those who passed.
Response:  We are given that there were 902 students in class 9 and 811 students passed. So, the number of students who did not pass is 902 - 811 = 131. Therefore, out of the total 446 students, 131 did not pass.
Response:  We are given that there were 632 students in class 632 and 410 of them passed their exams. So, the number of students who did not pass is equal to the total number of students minus those who passed, which is 632 - 410 = 222. Therefore, out of the remaining 465 students, 222 will be promoted to standard 7.
Response:  We are given that there were 732 students in class 7 and 761 students in class 8. So, the total number of students in both classes is 732 + 761 = 1493. Since we are asked how many more students there are in class 8 than in class 7, we can simply subtract the number of students in class 7 from the number of students in class 8: 1493 - 732 = 761. Therefore, there are 761 more students in class 8 than in class 7.
Response:  We are given that there were 135 students in class 1 and they scored an average of 214 marks. Also, we know that there were 496 students in total and they scored an average of 910 marks. Now, to find out how many students scored above 214 marks, we can use the following calculation: Number of students who scored above 214 = Total number of students - Number of students who scored less than or equal to 214. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of students who scored above 214 = 496 - 135 = 361. Therefore, there were 361 students who scored above 214 marks.
Response:  We are given that there are 308 students in class 3A and 318 students in class 3B. To find out how many students have passed, we need to subtract the number of failures from the total number of students. So, if 36 students failed, the number of passers would be: 308 - 36 = 272. Therefore, there are 272 students who passed.
Response:  We are given that there are 315 students in class 3A and 309 students in class 3B. To find out how many students have passed, we need to subtract the number of failing students from the total number of students. So, the number of passing students is: 772 - (315 + 309) = 772 - 624 = 148. Therefore, there are 148 students who have passed.
Response:  If there are 402 students in class 402 and each student has 739 books, then the total number of books is 402 x 739 = 291,560 books. Therefore, the correct answer is 291,560.
Response:  We are given that there are 458 students in class 458 and we want to find out how many students will be in each class if there are 692 students in total. To do this, we can divide the total number of students (692) by the number of classes (458). So, the answer is 1.43 students per class.
Response:  We are given that there were 362 students who passed their exams and got admitted to Form One. From this group of students, 257 were girls. So, the number of boys is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls. Therefore, the number of boys = Total Number Of Students - Number Of Girls = 362 - 257 = 95.
Response:  If Edward was initially 18 years old and lost 2 years (since he is now 16), then his current age would be 18 - 2 = 16. So, Edward's current age is 16 years old.
Response:  At first, Edward had Kshs 13. Then he lost Kshs 3. So now he has Kshs 10 (Kshs 13 - Kshs 3).
Response:  We are given that Edward has $9 and Kisha has $8 more than him. So, if we add $9 + ($8 - $0), we get $17. Therefore, Edward had $17.
Response:  If Edward had $16 and spent $6, then he has $10 left ($16 - $6 = $10). So, the answer is $10.
Response:  We have been given that there are two books and each book costs $6. So, if we buy both books together, we will pay $6 + $6 = $12. Therefore, the cost of one book is half of $12, which is $6.
Response:  If Edward had $6 and spent $16 on books, he would have $10 left ($6 - $16). Then, if he spent another $19 on something else, he would have $10 - $19 = -$9 left (negative $9). So, Edward did not have enough money to buy anything after spending $19.
Response:  We know that Edward paid $4 for each book and he bought 3 books of mathematics and 5 books of physics. So, in total, he spent $4 x 3 = $12 for the mathematics books. Now, we have to find out how much he spent on physics books. Since he bought 5 books of physics, he spent $4 x 5 = $20 on them. Therefore, the total amount Edward spent is $12 + $20 = $32.
Response:  We know that Edward has $16 in cash and he spends $8 on lunch. So now he has $16 - $8 = $8 left. Now he buys a book for $19, so he spent $19 - $8 = $11 more than what he had initially. Therefore, the amount of money Edward spent over and above what he originally had is $11.
Response:  According to the question, Edward had $17 and gave $10 to his friend. So he has $7 left.
Response:  We are given that Zachary did 44 push-ups in one minute and David did 58 push-ups in one minute more than Zachary. So if Zachary took x minutes to do 44 push-ups, then David took x + 1 minute to do 58 push-ups. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 44 = x + 1 (push-ups done by Zachary) 58 = x + 2 (push-ups done by David). Solving for x, we get: x = 30. So Zachary did 44 push-ups in 30 minutes and David did 58 push-ups in 31 minutes.
Response:  We are given that Zachary can do 51 push-ups and David can do 44 push-ups. To find out if Zachary can do more than David, we need to subtract David's number of push-ups from Zachary's number of push-ups. So, Zachary can do 51 - 44 = 7 more push-ups than David. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We are given that David did 44 push-ups in one set and Zachary did 9 more than him. So, if David did 44 push-ups, then Zachary did 53 push-ups (9 + 44).
Response:  We are given that David performed 51 push-ups in one set and Zachary performed 49 push-ups in one set. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did. So, the difference between their numbers of push-ups is: 51 - 49 = 2. Therefore, Zachary did 2 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. If we subtract the number of push-ups that David did (19) from the total number of crunches that Zachary did (44), we get 25. So, David did 25 crunches.
Response:  We are given that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. David did 29 push-ups more than Zachary but only 13 crunches more than Zachary. So, David did 14 crunches (44 - 13 = 31).
Response:  Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches, while David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary but only 10 more crunches than him. So, if we subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the total number of push-ups done by Zachary, we get 53 - 17 = 36 push-ups left. Similarly, if we subtract the number of crunches that David did from the total number of crunches done by Zachary, we get 14 - 10 = 4 crunches left. Therefore, Zachary alifanya push-ups 36 na crunches 4.
Response:  Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, while David did 58 push-ups and 87 crunches. To find out who did more push-ups than crunches, we need to subtract the number of crunches from the number of push-ups for each person. For Zachary, we have: 35 - 3 = 32 push-ups more than crunches. For David, we have: 58 - 87 = -39 push-ups less than crunches. So, Zachary did more push-ups than crunches.
"Response:  Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches, while David did 38 push-ups and 62 crunches. To find out who did more crunches than push-ups, we need to subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches for each person.
Zachary: 58 - 46 = 12
David: 62 - 38 = 24
Therefore, Zachary did more crunches than push-ups by 12 - 4 = 8."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups, and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 58 push-ups (39 + 19).
Response:  We are given that Zachary did 51 push-ups in total. David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Since John did 4 less than David, John did 69 push-ups (73 - 4 = 69). Therefore, John alifanya push-up ngapi 69.
Response:  We are given that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David did 54 push-ups (39 + 15). Now we are asked how many push-ups Zachary did more than John did. Since John did 9 push-ups, Zachary did 45 push-ups more than John (54 - 9 = 45). Therefore, Zachary alifanya push-up ngapi zaidi ya John.
Response:  If David can do 30 more push-ups than Zachary, and he did 37 push-ups, then Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary can do 7 push-ups.
Response:  If David can do 56 push-ups and Zachary does 38, then we know that David did 18 more push-ups than Zachary (56 - 38 = 18). So, the difference between the number of push-ups done by David and Zachary is 18.
Response:  If David did 40 push-ups and 17 crunches, that means he did 40 + 17 = 57 repetitions in total. Since Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches, he did 34 + 62 = 96 repetitions in total. Therefore, David did more crunches than Zachary (57 > 96).
"Response:  If David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and Zachary did 33 more crunches than David, then we can write this as an equation:  
David did 36 + (Zachary - David) = 58 
Simplifying the equation, we get:   
36 + 21 = 58 
Solving for David's number of push-ups, we find that he did 36 push-ups. 
Therefore, David did 36 push-ups more than Zachary."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, David performed 27 push-ups and 7 crunches, while Zachary performed 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. To determine which one did more crunches than push-ups, we need to subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches for each person. For David, we have 27 - 7 = 20 crunches more than push-ups. For Zachary, we have 17 - 5 = 12 crunches more than push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did more crunches than push-ups.
Response:  The number of questions for math is 5 and for reading comprehension it is 2. So, if we add both numbers together, we get 7. Therefore, the person had more questions in math (5) than in reading comprehension (2).
Response:  The number of students in class A is 30 and they are taking exams for subjects C and D. Therefore, the total marks obtained by each student will be 60 (30 x 2). Now, let's consider the case where some students did not take examinations for subject B. If there were 15 such students, then their total marks would be zero since they did not sit for any exams. So, the total number of marks obtained by all students including those who did not sit for examination for subject B is 750 (60 x 30 + 0 x 15). However, if we exclude these 15 students, then the total number of marks obtained by all remaining students is 850 (60 x 30). Therefore, the difference between the two cases is 100 (850 - 750)
Response:  If Rachel was given 5 tasks to complete in total and each task took her approximately 2 hours to finish, then she would have spent around 10 hours (5 x 2) working on those tasks. However, if she also had to study for 7 subjects, which typically require around 4-6 hours of studying per subject, then she would have spent an additional 28-39 hours studying (7 x 4-6). Therefore, the total amount of time Rachel spent studying or working can be calculated as follows: Total Time = 10 + 28-39 = 48-57 hours.
Response:  If Rachel was able to solve 7 math problems in total, and she solved 4 more than she could read, then she solved 11 math problems (7 + 4 = 11). Therefore, her score is 11/5 = 2.2.
Response:  If Rachel was able to solve 8 problems in mathematics, and she solved 3 more than that, then she solved 11 problems in total (8 + 3 = 11). So, the correct answer is 11.
Response:  If Rachel was able to solve 8 problems in math, and she solved 6 more than that, then she solved 14 problems in total (8 + 6 = 14). So, her score is 14/20 or 70%.
Response:  If Rachel was able to solve 10 problems of math in total, and she solved 3 more than she could solve in reading comprehension, then the number of problems she could solve in reading comprehension is 10 - 3 = 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response: 
Rachel has worked for 2 years in accounting (kurusa 2), she has read books for 3 years (kursa 3), and she has studied biology for 10 years more than that (kura 10). To calculate the total number of years Rachel has spent studying, we can add up these amounts:
Years studying = Years working + Years reading + Years studying - Years ago
= 2 + 3 + 10 - 2 = 16 years
Therefore, the answer is 16 years."
Response:  The total number of questions is 9 + 2 = 11. If we subtract the number of questions in Biology (96), then the remaining questions are 11 - 96 = -85. Therefore, the person had more questions in Hesabu than Kusoma and Biology combined.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Rachel had 11 jobs, 2 jobs related to reading, and 3 jobs related to biology. Therefore, the number of jobs that Rachel had more than 3 was 8 (11 - 3 = 8). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Rachel has a job as an accountant (kurusan 7), reads books (kursa 11), and studies biology (kursa 8). Now, let's analyze how these jobs relate to each other. As an accountant, Rachel likely uses mathematical calculations and analysis every day, which is closely related to her reading books (since she can read more complex texts and improve her vocabulary). However, studying biology may not be directly related to either of those two jobs, as it involves learning about living organisms and their interactions with the environment. Therefore, we could assign a weighted score of 3 for her job as an accountant, 2 for her reading books, and 1 for her studying biology, based on the perceived relevance of each activity to her other jobs. So, the total score would be: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
"Response: 
Rachel had 9 jobs in total.
She spent 11 hours studying and 29 hours watching TV.
So, if we calculate the total time she spent doing something useful (studying or working), it would be:
Total useful time = Study time + Work time
= 11 hours + 9 hours
= 20 hours
Therefore, Rachel was not lazy because she spent more than half of her day (20/48) doing something productive."
Response:  Rachel worked for 8 hours in math, 7 hours in reading, and 3 hours in biology. To calculate the total number of hours she spent studying, we can add up all these values: 8 + 7 + 3 = 18 hours. So, Rachel studied for 18 hours in total.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has scored 5 in mathematics, 10 in reading comprehension and 6 in biology. To calculate her overall score, we need to add up all these scores. So, the total score is:  5 + 10 + 6 = 21. Therefore, Rachel's overall score is 21.
Response:  The number of questions for reading comprehension was 2 and the number of questions for math was 4. To determine which one had more questions, we need to compare the total number of questions in each category. Therefore, the total number of questions for reading comprehension is 2 + 2 = 4, while the total number of questions for math is 4 + 4 = 8. So, there are more questions in the math section than in the reading comprehension section.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Rachel has been assigned to read books for grades 4, 7 and 19 more than her grade level. So, if she is in grade 4, then she will have to read books for grades 5-8 (inclusive). Therefore, the total number of books she needs to read is 5 + 6 + 8 = 29 books more than what she is currently reading.
Response:  We are given that Jack has 6 apples and he wants to share them equally among 2 of his friends. So, each friend will get 3 apples (6/2 = 3). Now, we are asked how many more hours Jack will work if he works for every hour he gets an apple. Since Jack works for 1 hour per apple, he will work for 3 hours in total (3 apples / 1 apple per hour = 3 hours). Therefore, the answer is 3 hours.
Response:  The number of hours that Jack worked in the morning is 6 hours and he took a break for 2 hours. So, the total time he spent working after his break is 6 + 2 = 8 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 hours.
Response:  If Jack poke 4 fish in the morning and he caught 5 fish that day, then the total number of fish he caught is 9 (4 + 5).
Response:  According to the question, Jack has 6 hours of work in the morning (barua pepe 6), 3 hours of break time (barua pepe 3), and 5 hours of work in the evening (barua pepe 5). Therefore, the total number of working hours for Jack is: 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 hours.
Response:  According to the question, Jack has 5 apples in the morning, and he gives away 3 of them in the afternoon. So, he has 5 - 3 = 2 apples left in the afternoon. Then, he buys 4 more apples, so he has 2 + 4 = 6 apples in total. Finally, he gives away 2 more apples, leaving him with 6 - 2 = 4 apples. Therefore, the answer is 4 apples.
Response:  According to the question, Jack has poked 4 holes in one bar of wood, and each hole takes him 1 minute to make. Therefore, he has spent 4 minutes making those 4 holes. Now, he moves on to another bar of wood and spends 5 minutes making 5 holes in it. Finally, he makes 8 holes in the last bar of wood, which takes him 8 minutes. So, the total time taken by Jack to make all these holes is 4 + 5 + 8 = 17 minutes.
Response:  According to the question, Jack has 3 apples in the morning, 4 apples at noon, and 8 apples in the evening. So, the total number of apples Jack has is: 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 apples. Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  We are given that Jack poked 10 bees in the morning, 7 of which were busy and 17 were not busy. So, we have to find out how many bees Jack was able to poke after lunch. To do this, we need to subtract the number of busy bees from the total number of bees he poked in the morning. Therefore, the number of bees Jack was able to poke after lunch is: 10 - 7 = 3.
Response:  According to the question, Jack poked 9 holes in the morning, 10 holes in the afternoon, and 7 holes in the evening. So, the total number of holes poked by Jack is 9 + 10 + 7 = 26 holes. Therefore, the answer is 26.
Response:  We have 10 hours in total (barua pepe 10). Out of these, we worked for 5 hours during the daytime (barua pepe 5 mchana). So, the remaining time was spent at night (barua pepe 4 jioni). Therefore, Jack worked for a total of 5 + 4 = 9 hours.
"Response:  If Jack poke 6 holes in a barrel and then he poked 3 more holes, how many holes will be there in total if he continues to poke holes at this rate of 10 holes per day? Therefore, the number of holes that Jack will make is;  6 + (3 x 10) = 6 + 30 = 36 holes."
Response:  We are given that Jack alipokea barua pepe 3 na barua 64 asubuhi. This means he has worked for 3 hours and earned 64 shillings. Then we are told that kisha alipokea barua pepe 5 na barua 54 mchana. This means she has worked for 5 hours and earned 54 shillings. Finally, we are asked how much money Jack made in one day if he works for 8 hours. So, to find out how much Jack made in one day, we need to add the amount of money he made in one hour (64/8 = 8) times the number of hours he worked (8). Therefore, Jack made 8 x 8 = 64 shillings in one day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack poked his barua (stick) into the ground at 5 o'clock and pulled it out at 6 o'clock. Then he poked it again at 9 o'clock and pulled it out at 7 o'clock in the morning. So, the time when Jack poked his stick into the ground for the second time is 7 o'clock in the morning. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  According to the question, Jack made 10 pokes at the ball in 2 hours (asubuhi). Therefore, he made one poke every 6 minutes (barua 1/6). Similarly, according to the second part of the question, Kisha made 3 pokes at the ball in 44 minutes (mchana). So she made one poke every 15 minutes (barua 1/15). Now we need to find out how many more pokes Jack made than Kisha. To do this, we divide the time taken by Jack to make his last poke by the time taken by Kisha to make her last poke: 12 - 4 = 8 Asubuhi. Therefore, Jack made 8 more pokes than Kisha.
Response:  According to the question, Jack poked 6 bars at 8 am and 2 bars at 7 pm. So, in total, he poked 6 + 2 = 8 bars. Therefore, Jack poked more bars after 7 pm than before 8 am.
Response:  We are given that Jack alipokea barua pepe is equal to 6 na akatuma barua 91 asubuhi. Now we need to find out how many hours Jack has worked in total. So, we multiply the number of days he worked (6) with the number of hours he worked per day (91). Therefore, Jack has worked for 576 hours (6 x 91 = 576).
Response:  According to the question, Jack has 4 hours of work in the morning and 2 hours of break time. In addition, he has 6 hours of work in the evening and 8 hours of break time. Therefore, Jack works for a total of 10 hours (4 + 2) during the day and 14 hours (6 + 8) at night. So, Jack works for a total of 24 hours per day.
"Response:  If Jack poked his friend 9 times in one day and each time he got a response of 7 smiles and 1 laugh, then how many smiles did Jack get in total that day?
So, if Jack poked his friend 9 times, he got 7 x 9 = 63 smiles. And if he also got 1 laugh, then the total number of responses he got is 63 + 1 = 64. Therefore, Jack got 64 smiles that day."
Response:  We are given that Jack alipokea (ate) 3 meals per day and each meal contains 5 portions of rice. Therefore, he eats a total of 3 x 5 = 15 portions of rice per day. Now we are asked how many times Jack has eaten rice in a whole week if he works for 40 hours per week. So, we divide the number of portions of rice he eats per day by the number of days he works per week to get the answer. In this case, he eats 15 portions of rice per day and works for 40 hours per week, so he has eaten a total of 15 x 7 = 105 portions of rice in a week.
Response:  If Jack poke 3 fish in the morning and 6 fish in the evening, then he caught a total of 9 fish (3 + 6 = 9). So, if he continued to catch fish at this rate for 10 days, he would have caught a total of 9 x 10 = 90 fish.
Response:  We are given that Panzi scored 9 points and Chura scored 12 points. To find out who scored more, we need to subtract the number of points scored by Panzi from the number of points scored by Chura. So, Chura scored more than Panzi by (12 - 9) = 3 points. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 points.
Response:  We are given that panzi na chura walikuwa na mashindano ya kuruka. This means that there were 40 people who participated in the Kuruku game. Now we are asked to find out how many times each number from 1 to 35 appeared in the list of participants. To do this, we will use the formula: Number of appearances = Total number of participants / Maximum value of the numbers. In this case, the total number of participants is 40 and the maximum value of the numbers is 35 (since no one appeared more than once). So, we can plug these values into the formula as follows: Number of appearances = 40 / 35 = 1.14. Therefore, the answer is 114.
Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 36 points and Chura scored 17 points more than Nzige. So, Chura scored 36 + 17 = 53 points.
Response:  We are given that Panzi scored 25 points and Chura scored 18 points more than Panzi. Therefore, Chura scored 43 points (25 + 18).
Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 19 points and Chura scored 10 points more than Nzige. Therefore, Chura scored 29 points (10 + 19). Now we need to find out how many points more Chura scored than Nzige. To do this, we subtract the score of Nzige from the score of Chura: 29 - 19 = 10. So, Chura scored 10 points more than Nzige.
Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 19 points and Panya scored 39 points more than Nzige. So, Panya scored 58 points (39 + 19). Now, we are asked to find out how many points Chura scored if he scored 94 points more than Panya. Therefore, Chura scored 102 points (94 + 9 = 102).
Response:  We are given that Panzi scored 25 points and Chura scored 32 points more than Panzi. So, Chura scored 57 points (32 + 25).
Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 24 points and Chura scored 33 points more than Nzige. So, Chura scored 57 points (33 + 24). Therefore, Panya scored 61 points more than Chura, which is 61 - 57 = 4 points.
Response:  The number of people who were not at the Kuruka event is 13 - 2 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 people who did not attend the Kuruka event.
Response:  The total number of people who attended the Kuruka event was 35. Out of these, 4 more people attended than the number of people who were invited (Panzi). Therefore, the difference between the number of people who attended and the number of people who were invited is 4. So, the answer is 39.
Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 19 points and then he scored 4 more points than Panya who scored 44 points. So, Nzige scored 44 + 4 = 48 points. Therefore, the answer is 48.
Response:  We are given that panzi = 39 and chura = 19. Now we need to find out how many times panzi is greater than chura. So, let's divide panzi by chura: panzi / chura = 39/19 = 2. Therefore, panzi is 2 times greater than chura.
"Response:  We are given that Nzige scored 21 points in his first game and 25 points in his second game. Therefore, we can calculate the difference between the two scores as follows:  
Nzige's score in the second game - Nzige's score in the first game = 25 - 21 = 4 points. So, Nzige scored 4 more points than he did in the first game."
Response:  We are given that there were 39 people who took part in the Kuruka competition and 17 of them won prizes. To find out how many more people won prizes than did not win prizes, we need to subtract the number of winners (17) from the total number of participants (39). Therefore, the answer is: 39 - 17 = 22. So, 22 more people did not win prizes than won prizes.
"Response:  We are given that ""Panzi"" had 9 chura (balls). Then we are told that ""Panya"" took 3 of those balls and gave them to his friend ""Chura"". So now ""Panya"" has 3 + 3 = 6 balls left. But then he lost 33 more balls while playing with Chura. Therefore, ""Panya"" currently has 6 - 33 = -27 balls. Since numbers can't be negative, the correct answer is -0 balls."
"Response:  We are given that ""Panzi"" had 14 children and ""Chura"" had 16 children. Now we need to find out how many more children ""Panya"" had than ""Panzi"". So, let's subtract the number of children ""Panzi"" had from the number of children ""Panya"" had. Therefore, the difference between the number of children ""Panya"" had and ""Panzi"" had is 37 - 14 = 23. Hence, ""Panya"" had 23 more children than ""Panzi""."
"Response: 
Mary has 14 eggs in total and she gives 6 to her friend. So, Mary now has 8 eggs left (14 - 6 = 8).

So, the number of eggs that Mary's friend has is 62."
"Response: 
Mary has 5 bags of maize and 10 bags of beans. She gives 2 bags of beans to her friend. So, she now has 8 bags of beans left (5 - 2 = 8).
Now, let's calculate the total number of bags of grains that Mary has after giving some away:
Grains = Maize + Beans = 5 + 8 = 13 bags."
"Response: 
Mary has 12 eggs in total and she sells them at Sh 5 each. So, she makes Sh 60 from egg sales. Now, let's calculate how much money she made from other sources of income.
From the question, we know that Mary earned Sh 11 from vegetable sales and Sh 49 from fruit sales. Therefore, her total earnings from these sources are Sh 11 + Sh 49 = Sh 60.
So, Mary's total earnings for the day are Sh 60 + Sh 60 = Sh 120."
Response:  We have 10 students in primary school (unoga), 2 students in secondary school (sukari), and 80 students in high school (chumvi). So far, we have a total of 92 students. If we subtract the number of students in primary school from the total number of students, we get 92 - 10 = 82 students in secondary school and high school combined. Therefore, there are 82 students in secondary school and high school combined.
"Response: 
Mary has 12 eggs in her basket and she gives 3 to her friend. So, Mary now has 9 eggs left.
Then, she buys 4 more eggs from the market. So, Mary now has 13 eggs in total (9 + 4).
Next, she breaks 2 eggs while cooking breakfast for herself and her family. So, Mary now has 11 eggs left (13 - 2).
Finally, she shares 5 eggs with her neighbor who comes over for dinner. So, Mary now has 6 eggs left (11 - 5)."
"Response: 
Vikombe 6 vya unga = 6 x 10 = 60
Vikombe 8 vya sukari = 8 x 20 = 160
Vikombe 7 vya chumvi = 7 x 30 = 210
TOTAL = 60 + 160 + 210 = 430
Therefore, the total number of eggs collected is 430."
"Response: 
Mary has 12 eggs in her basket and she gives 6 to Vikombe 13. So, Mary now has 6 - 6 = 0 eggs left.
Vikombe gets 6 eggs from Mary, so he now has 12 + 6 = 18 eggs.
After giving 2 eggs to Vikombe 2, Mary now has 0 - 2 = -2 eggs left.
Therefore, the final number of eggs that Mary has is -2."
"Response: 
Mary has 10 eggs and she gives 3 to her friend. So, Mary now has 7 eggs left.
She then buys 2 bags of sugar with each bag containing 5 kg. So, Mary now has 10 kg of sugar in total.
Finally, she donates Ksh 1000 to a charity organization.
Therefore, the amount of money Mary has after giving away the eggs, buying sugar, and making the donation is:
Ksh 1000 - Ksh 3 = Ksh 997
So, the answer is Ksh 997."
"Response: 
Mary has 10 eggs in total (6 from chicken and 4 from duck). She gives away 3 eggs to her friend. So, she has 7 eggs left (6 from chicken + 1 from duck).
Now, she buys 2 eggs of hen. So, she has 9 eggs in total (7 from chicken + 2 from hen).
Finally, she gives away 2 eggs to her child. So, she has 7 eggs left (9 - 2 = 7)."
"Response: 
Mary has 5 bags of sugar and she gives 3 bags to her friend. So, Mary now has 2 bags of sugar left.
Next, Mary buys 1 bag of sugar from the market, so now she has 1 bag of sugar left.

"Response: 
Mary has 35 eggs in total (7 from Sukari + 28 from Unga). She gives away 10 eggs to Vikombe. So, she has 25 eggs left (35 - 10 = 25).
Now, let's calculate how many eggs are there for each of the 4 sukari farmers:
Sukari Farmer 1 gets 7/4 = 1 and 9/4 = 2 eggs from Mary.
Sukari Farmer 2 gets 6/4 = 1 and 5/4 = 1 egg from Mary.
Sukari Farmer 3 gets 5/4 = 1 egg from Mary.
Sukari Farmer 4 gets 4/4 = 1 egg from Mary.
Therefore, the number of eggs that Mary gives to each of the 4 sukari farmers is:
1 egg + 2 eggs + 1 egg + 1 egg = 7 eggs."
"Response:  The number of students in class 10 is 30 (as per the question). Now, let's calculate the number of students in each class from class 9 to class 14.
Class 9 - 25 students
Class 10 - 30 students
Class 11 - 35 students
Class 12 - 40 students
Class 13 - 45 students
Class 14 - 50 students
Therefore, the total number of students in all classes from class 9 to class 14 is:
30 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 50 = 270 students."
Response:  We are given that there are 19 families with 5 members each, so we have 19 x 5 = 95 people in total. Now, we are asked how many of these people will be left if 60 of them go to another place. So, the number of people who will be left is 95 - 60 = 35. Therefore, the answer is 35.
Response:  We are given that there are 87 families in total and each family has at least one child. Therefore, we can say that the number of children is equal to or greater than 87. Now, let's consider the fact that some families may have more than one child, so we need to calculate the maximum possible value for the number of children per family. Based on this information, we can conclude that the number of children per family is at most 87/7 = 12. So, the number of children who will go to school is at most 12 x 87 = 1054.
"Response:  The number of families with more than 5 members is 20 (families 1-20). Since each family has an average of 3.5 members per household, we can calculate the total number of people in these households as follows:
Total number of people = Number of families x Average number of members per family
= 20 x 3.5
= 70
Therefore, there are approximately 70 people living in these households."
Response:  We are given that there are 85 families in total and each family has at least one child. Therefore, we can say that the number of children is equal to or greater than 85. Now, let's consider the two regions - Africa and Asia. For Africa, we have 23 families with at least one child, while for Asia, we have 37 families with at least one child. So, the difference between the number of children in these two regions is:  37 - 23 = 14. Therefore, the number of children who live outside of Africa is 14.
Response:  We are given that there are 8 families of birds with different numbers of eggs per family. The number of eggs per family is as follows: Family 1 has 5 eggs, Family 2 has 7 eggs, Family 3 has 9 eggs, Family 4 has 11 eggs, Family 5 has 13 eggs, Family 6 has 15 eggs, Family 7 has 17 eggs, and Family 8 has 19 eggs. Now we need to find out which group of families has more eggs in total. To do this, we will add up all the eggs from each family and compare them. So, let's calculate the total number of eggs for Families 1-8 as follows: Family 1 has 5 eggs, Family 2 has 7 eggs, Family 3 has 9 eggs, Family 4 has 11 eggs, Family 5 has 13 eggs, Family 6 has 15 eggs, Family 7 has 17 eggs, and Family 8 has 19 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs for Families 1-8 is 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 105 eggs. On the other hand, if we look at Families 31-42, they have a total of 31 + 33 + 35 + 37 + 39 + 41 + 43 = 271 eggs. As you can see, Families 1-8 have fewer eggs than Families 31-42, so the answer is (A) Families 31-42.
"Response:  We are given that there are 38 families of birds living in Kenya and they have built their nests on different mountains. If we assume that each family has an average of 5 members (which is a rough estimate), then we have approximately 190 birds per mountain (38 families x 5 members/family = 190 birds).
Now, let's consider the number of families of birds living in Africa as a whole. According to the question, there are 47 families of birds living in Africa. Assuming again that each family has an average of 5 members, then we have approximately 235 birds per African country (47 families x 5 members/family = 235 birds).
Moving on to Asia, we are told that there are 94 families of birds living there. Assuming once again that each family has an average of 5 members, then we have approximately 470 birds per Asian country (94 families x 5 members/family = 470 birds).
Therefore, based on these calculations, the answer to the question is:
Family 94 from Asia has more birds than Family 47 from Africa."
Response:  We are given that there are 18 families of birds with their nests located in different parts of the world. Out of these, 38 families have their nests in Africa and 80 families have their nests in Asia. Therefore, if we want to know the total number of bird families that have their nests outside Africa, we can subtract the number of families that have their nests in Africa from the total number of families. So, the answer is: Total number of bird families that have their nests outside Africa = Number of families that have their nests in Africa - 18 = 42.
Response:  We are given that there are 87 families living in a certain area and each family has an average of 5 members. Therefore, we have 87 x 5 = 435 people living in this area. Now, we are asked how many families there would be if each family had 2 more children than they do now. So, if each family has 5 members now, then after 2 more children, each family will have 7 members (5 + 2). Therefore, the number of families that will be left is 87 - 7 = 80 families.
"Response:  We have to find out how many families there are in total and then calculate the number of children per family. So let's start with the first part of the question: ""Msimu wa baridi unakaribia na wanyama wengi wanahama kwenda nchi zenye joto."" This means that there are 49 goats grazing in the field outside the village. Now we need to find out how many families there are in total. To do this, we can divide the number of goats by the average number of children per family. According to the passage, ""familia 59 za ndege zilienda mbali kwa ajili ya msimu wa baridi na familia 24 mpya za ndege zilikuja kuishi karibu na mlima."" This means that each family has an average of 24 children. So if we divide the number of goats (49) by the average number of children per family (24), we get the total number of families: 49 / 24 = 2.04 families. Therefore, there are approximately 2.04 families in total."
Response:  We are given that there are 27 families with 5 members each, and we want to know how many people will be left in the village after 41 families have gone to the mountain. To find out, we need to subtract the number of families that went to the mountain from the total number of families in the village. So, let X = 41 - 27 = 14. Therefore, there will be 14 people left in the village after 41 families have gone to the mountain.
Response:  The total number of families in the village is 86. If we take away 45 families who have already been affected by the drought and are struggling to survive, then there are 41 remaining families (86 - 45 = 41). Therefore, the number of families that will be left without water after the drought has passed is 41.
"Response:  We have two groups of people - those who want to go to Africa and those who want to go to Asia. The number of families that want to go to Africa is 41, while the number of families that want to go to Asia is 62. Therefore, if we divide the total number of families (103) by the number of families that want to go to Africa, we get:  
(103)/41 = 2.5
So, there are approximately 2.5 times more families that want to go to Africa than those that want to go to Asia."
Response:  We have three families with 10 members each = 30 people in total. Family number two has 26 members = 26 x 1 = 26 people. Therefore, family number one has 3 - 26 = -23 people more than family number two.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 253 students in his class and he gave them 70 exams. So, we need to find out how many times each student took an exam. To do this, divide the total number of exams (70) by the total number of students (253). This gives us approximately 0.28 or 28% of the time. Therefore, Paul's students took an exam approximately 28% of the time during the school year.
Response:  We are given that there were 551 students in total and 177 of them passed. So, we can calculate the pass rate as follows: Pass rate = Number of students who passed / Total number of students x 100% Therefore, the pass rate is 32.6%. (551 - 177) / 551 x 100%
"Response:  We are given that Paul has 440 friends in total and he wants to invite them for lunch. He can only accommodate 111 of his friends at a time due to space constraints. So, we need to find out how many times Paul will have to invite his friends for lunch if he wants to invite all of them.
To do this, we divide the total number of friends (440) by the maximum number of friends he can accommodate at a time (111):
Number of times Paul needs to invite his friends = Total number of friends / Maximum number of friends per invitation
= 440 / 111
= 3.95 times
So, Paul will need to invite his friends for lunch approximately 3.95 times if he wants to invite all of them."
"Response:  We are given that Paul scored 65 marks in the exam and he had 213 friends who also took the exam. To find out how many of his friends scored below him, we need to subtract the number of friends who scored above him from the total number of friends. So, if 16 of his friends scored above him, then the number of friends who scored below him is:
Total number of friends = 213
Number of friends who scored above him = 16
Number of friends who scored below him = Total number of friends - Number of friends who scored above him
= 213 - 16
= 197
Therefore, 197 of Paul's friends scored below him in the exam."
"Response:  We are given that Paul scored 589 marks in his exams and he got 161 friends who also took the same exam. So, we need to find out how many of these friends scored more than Paul did. To do this, we can subtract the number of friends who scored less than Paul from the total number of friends. Therefore, the number of friends who scored more than Paul is:
(Total number of friends - Number of friends who scored less than Paul) = (589 - 161) = 428
So, out of Paul's 161 friends, 428 scored more than him in the exam."
Response:  We are given that in one year (mwaka), there were 110 students who passed their exams and received certificates. Out of these, 90 students had friends. Now, we need to find out how many more friends each student has than the number of students they have. To do this, we will use the formula: Number of friends = Total number of friends / Number of students with friends. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of friends = 412 / 90 = 4.6. Therefore, each student has approximately 4.6 more friends than the total number of students who passed their exams.
Response:  We are given that there were 563 students in total and 558 of them passed their exams successfully. This means that 7 students did not pass their exams. To find out how many failed to get a score of at least 332 points, we can divide the number of students who did not pass by the total number of students. So, the answer is 7/563 = 0.127 or approximately 12.7%.
"Response:  We are given that there were 52 friends in total and each friend had at least one friend who passed their exams with 535 marks or more. So, the number of friends who passed with 535 marks or more is equal to the total number of friends minus the number of friends who did not pass with 535 marks or more.
We can write this as follows: Number of friends who passed = Total number of friends - Number of friends who did not pass
Substituting the values we know into the equation above, we get:
Number of friends who passed = 52 - x
Where 'x' represents the number of friends who did not pass with 535 marks or more.
Now, we need to find out how many friends did not pass with 535 marks or more. To do this, we will subtract the number of friends who passed from the total number of friends. This gives us:
Number of friends who did not pass = Total number of friends - Number of friends who passed
Substituting the values we know into the equation above, we get:
Number of friends who did not pass = 52 + 492 - x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Number of friends who did not pass = 544 - x
Therefore, the number of friends who did not pass with 535 marks or more is 544 - x."
Response:  We are given that there were 521 students in total and 66 of them passed with flying colors (mafutundo). This means that 66/521 = 0.127 or approximately 13%. So, out of every 100 students, about 13 will pass with flying colors.
Response:  We are given that there were 531 students in class 38 and we need to find out how many of them passed their exams with at least one subject. So, let X be the number of students who passed with at least one subject. From the question, we know that among these 531 students, 391 did not pass any subjects. Therefore, the number of students who failed is equal to 391 - X. Now, we want to find out how many more students passed than those who failed. So, let Y = X + (391 - X). Substituting this expression for Y into the equation above, we get 531 - Y = 0. Solving for Y, we get Y = 240. Therefore, there were 240 students who passed with at least one subject.
"Response:  We are given that there were 601 students in total and 406 passed with grade C+ or above. So, we have to find out how many failed. To do this, we subtract the number of those who passed from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of failures is equal to:  
Total no. of students = 601
No. of students who passed = 406
So, the number of failures is equal to: Total no. of students - No. of students who passed = 601 - 406 = 195
Therefore, the percentage of failures is equal to: Percentage of failures = (Number of failures / Total no. of students) x 100% = (195/601) x 100% = 32%."
"Response:  We are given that there were 291 students who passed their exams and we want to find out how many of them scored below 315 marks. So, let X be the number of students who scored below 315 marks. Since all the students passed, we can write; X + 291 = 315. Now, we solve for X using subtraction; X = 315 - 291 = 24. Therefore, 24 students scored below 315 marks."
Response:  We are given that in one year (mwaka), there were 267 students who passed their exams and got certificates. Now we want to know how many of these students have more than 3 friends (marafiki). To find out this number, we need to divide the total number of students who passed with the number of friends each student has. So, we will divide 267 by 3 = 89. Therefore, more than 89 students have more than 3 friends.
Response:  We are given that there were 523 students in the class and we need to find out how many erasers they used. Since each student had 4 erasers, the total number of erasers used is 523 x 4 = 2102 erasers. Now, let's find out how many more crayons were sold than erasers. The question states that there were 320 crayons sold, so the difference between the number of crayons sold and erasers used is 320 - 2102 = -1882 crayons. Therefore, the answer is -1882 crayons.
Response:  We are given that there were 11 people in total and after some of them left, there were 3 remaining. Now we want to know which group had more than half of the original number. To do this, we need to find out how many people were in the original group (11) and then calculate what percentage of that number is 3/4 (which is equivalent to finding 3/4 of 11). So, the answer is 3/4 x 11 = 7.69. Therefore, the group with more than half of the original number was 7.
Response:  The first person had 3 children who were not his biological children. After he died, they became orphans and were taken care of by their grandmother who was number 4 from the dead man. So, the correct answer is (D) Grandmother.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 9 cows and after 4 years, 12 more cows were added. So, in total, we have 9 + 12 = 21 cows.
Response:  We are given that there were 14 people in total and 5 of them had dogs. So, the number of people who did not have dogs is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 13 water jars and after some people took some away, there were 4 left. If 9 more water jars were added later, how many water jars would be left now? So, the answer is 13 + 9 = 22 water jars left.
Response:  We are given that there were 12 watermelons in total and 15 people shared them equally. So each person got how many watermelons? 15/12 = 1.25 watermelons per person. Since we can't have half of a watermelon, each person got one whole watermelon. Therefore, the number of watermelons left after they were divided among the 15 people is 14 - 1 = 13 watermelons.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 3 people who took part in the race and after some time, 8 more people joined them. So, the total number of people participating in the race is 3 + 8 = 11. Therefore, the answer to the question is 11.
Response:  We are given that there were 8 people in total and after eating, they had 5 left. So initially, each person had how much food? To find this out, we divide the total amount of food (8 x 5 = 40) by the number of people (8). Therefore, each person had 5/8 = 0.625 portions of food. Now, let's calculate the number of portions left over after everyone finished eating. Since there were 99 portions of food and only 5 remained, the remaining portions are 99 - 5 = 94. So, one person had approximately 0.625 + 94 = 94.625 portions of food.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 12 people and after some time, 4 more people joined them. So, the total number of people now is 12 + 4 = 16. Later, 3 more people left, leaving behind 16 - 3 = 13 people. Therefore, the final number of people who remained at the end was 13.
Response:  If Dan gave $3 to Baadi and got back $2, then he lost $1. So, his loss is $1. Therefore, the answer is $1.
Response:  If Dan gave $4 and Ali received $3, then there is $1 left over. So, the amount of money that was left over after they exchanged their cash is $1.
Response:  We are given that Dan has $4 and he spends $1 on each of the 99 bottles of water. So, he spends a total of $1 x 99 = $99. Now, we are asked how much money is left with him after buying all those bottles. Since he spent $99 and he had $4 initially, the amount of money left with him is $4 - $99 = $-95. Therefore, the answer is $-95.
Response:  We have been given that Dan has $3 and he spends $2 for each of the two pipis he buys. Therefore, he spends a total of $4 (2 x $2). Since he has $3 to start with, he will be left with $1 after buying the two pipis. So, the number of pipis Dan can buy is $1 / $2 = 0.5 or half a pipi.
Response:  The cost of one piece of toilet paper is $0.5. So, if you buy 12 pieces, it will cost $0.5 x 12 = $6. Now, you are given that you have spent $2 on toilet paper. Therefore, the number of pieces of toilet paper you bought is $6 - $2 = $4.
Response:  We have been given that Dan has $7 and he spends $2 on something. So, his remaining amount is $7 - $2 = $5. Then, he buys chokolets for $3, so his remaining amount becomes $5 - $3 = $2. Therefore, the total amount of money Dan has after buying chokolets is $2.
Response:  The cost of one egg is $1 and that of two eggs is $2. So, if we buy three eggs, their total cost will be $3. Similarly, the cost of four eggs is $4, and so on. Therefore, the total cost of buying x eggs can be represented as follows: TC = x(1 + (x-1)/2) Where x is the number of eggs bought. Now, according to the question, Dan paid $4 for eggs. So, we can set up the equation: TC = 4 Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this equation, we get: 4 = 4(1 + (4-1)/2) Simplifying the equation, we get: 4 = 4(3/2) Solving for x, we get: x = 8 Therefore, Dan paid $8 for the eggs he bought.
"Response: 
Dan gave $2 to Ali and $4 to Chiku. So, Ali has $2 + $4 = $6 and Chiku has $4. Now, Ali wants to share his money equally among all three of them. So, he will give each of them $6/3 = $2.
Now, let's calculate how much each person will get after sharing the remaining amount equally among themselves.
Choku will get $4/3 = $1.33 and Ali will get $2 - ($1.33 x 2) = $2 - $2.66 = $0.34.
Therefore, the final distribution of money is as follows:
Ali gets $0.34
Choku gets $1.33
And Dan gets nothing because he already gave away his entire amount."
"Response: 
Alichukua kibatari cha pipi kwa $2 = 2 x $2 = $4.
Alichukua chokoleti kwa $3 = 3 x $3 = $9.
Total amount of money earned from selling chokoleti and kibatari cha pipi is: $4 + $9 = $13."
"Response: 
Dan gave $4 to Ali and $8 to Batari. So far, they have received a total of $12 ($4 + $8).
Ali has $6 left ($12 - $6 = $6), while Batari has $0 left ($8 - $0 = $0).
As for the third person, their friend gave them $5. So, they now have $5 left ($5 - $0 = $5)."
Response:  If Dan had $3 before buying the candy bar, and he spent $4 to buy it, then he has $3 - $4 = -$1 left after buying the candy bar. So, the answer is -$1.
Response:  We are given that Dan has $4 and he spends $3 on each of ten pips (balls) he buys. So, in total, he spends $3 x 10 = $30. Now, we need to find out how much money Dan is left with after buying the balls. Therefore, we subtract the amount spent ($30) from the initial amount of money Dan had ($4), which gives us $4 - $30 = $-26. So, Dan is left with $-26.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and he spends $1 on something, then he will have $2 left. If he buys two items that cost $2 each, then he will spend a total of $4 (2 x $2 = $4). So, after spending $4, he will be left with $0 ($3 - $4 = $0). Therefore, the amount of money left in his wallet is zero.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan has is $5. He spends $3 on something and then he buys a bag of rice for $7. So, the remaining amount of money that Dan has after buying the bag of rice is: $5 - $3 = $2.
Response:  The cost of one chokoleti is $4 and that of a bar ya pipi is $7. So, if we buy both, the total cost will be $4 + $7 = $11. Now, let's subtract the cost of the bar ya pipi from the total cost to get the cost of the chokoleti only. Therefore, the cost of each chokoleti is $11 - $7 = $4.
"Response:  We are given that Paul had 115 books and he gave away 78 of them. So, we have to find out how many books Paul has left. To do this, we can use subtraction.
Paul has 115 - 78 = 37 books left."
Response:  We are given that Paul had 137 books in his library and after selling 105 of them, he was left with how many books? So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of books = Total number of books - Number of books sold. In this case, Number of books = 137 - 105 = 32. Therefore, Paul had 32 books left in his library after selling 105 books.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 108 books and he gave away 35 of them to his friend. So, the number of books left with him is 73 (108 - 35). Now, we are asked how many books Paul has after giving away another 27 books to his friend. Therefore, the total number of books left with Paul after giving away both sets of books is 46 (73 - 27).
Response:  If Paul had 50 books and after he read one book every day, he would have finished reading all his books in 50 days. However, if he then started reading another 151 books simultaneously with the ones he had already read, it means that he was able to finish reading all those additional books in 36 days (since there are 151 - 50 = 101 days left after finishing the initial 50 books). Therefore, the total number of books that Paul was able to finish reading is 50 + 151 = 201 books.
Response:  Vitabu 2 = 100 - 58 = 42. So, there are 42 books left after subtracting the number of books that were burned (58).
Response:  Vitabu 21 - Vitabu vipya 42 = 21 - 42 = -21. So, if we subtract the number of books that were not in the library from the total number of books, we get -21. Therefore, the correct answer is -21.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 71 books and he gave away 38 of them. Now we want to know how many books he has left. So, let X be the number of books Paul has left. According to the problem, after giving away 38 books, he had 116 books remaining (X + 38 = 116). Therefore, the number of books Paul has left is X = 78.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 108 books and wrote 55 pages. After deleting some pages from each book, he was left with 66 books and 59 pages. To find out how many pages were deleted, we can subtract the number of pages he had after deleting them from the total number of pages he initially had. So, the answer is 47 pages (66 - 59 = 47).
Response:  We are given that Paul had 51 books and wrote 106 pages. After deleting some of his pages, he was left with 82 pages. To find out how many words were deleted, we need to divide the number of pages he had after deletion (82) by the total number of pages he originally had (106). So, the number of words deleted is: 82 / 106 = 79 words.
"Response:  We are given that there were 27 questions in total and we have answered 136 of them. So, the number of unanswered questions is:
Unanswered questions = Total questions - Answered questions
= 27 - 136
= -109
Therefore, there were 109 unanswered questions."
Response:  We are given that Paul had 134 books and he gave away 39 of them to his friend. So, the number of books left with him is 134 - 39 = 95. Now, we are asked how many pages these books have in total. Since each book has an average of 200 pages (as mentioned in the passage), the total number of pages in all the books is 95 x 200 = 19,000 pages.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 95 books and he read 153 pages in total. After reading some of the books, he was left with 13 books and 23 pages remaining. So, the number of books Paul had after reading is 13.
Response:  We are given that Paul had 42 books and wrote 143 more pages. After writing these additional pages, he had 113 pages left with 19 blank spaces. To find out how many words were written in those 113 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of blank spaces. So, the answer is 113 / 19 = 5.76.
Response:  The number of people who went to the mountain was 10. Jessica went up the mountain 8 steps further than her tree stand. So, if we draw a line from Jessica's tree stand to the top of the mountain, it will be 8 + 1 = 9 steps long. Therefore, the distance between Jessica and the top of the mountain is 9 steps.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 16 warthogs in a forest and after some time, 23 more warthogs entered the same forest. So, we have to find out how many warthogs are currently in the forest. To do this, we can use the information provided in the question as follows: Initially, there were 16 warthogs in the forest + 23 new warthogs = Total number of warthogs in the forest now = 16 + 23 = 49 warthogs. Therefore, the answer is 49.
"Response:  We are given that there were 23 cows in total and Jessica took 4 of them from the field where they were grazing. So, we have to find out how many cows were left after Jessica took some away. To do this, we can use subtraction.
Maua mangapi = Total number of cows - Number of cows taken by Jessica
= 23 - 4
= 19
Therefore, there were 19 cows left after Jessica took 4 away."
Response:  We are given that there were initially 15 cows in a herd and after some time, 2 more cows joined the herd from outside, making it 17 cows in total. So, the increase in number of cows is 2 (the number of new cows that joined). Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 21 cows in the field and after Jessica fed them, she counted 34 cows again from the same field. So, we can say that 13 more cows came to the field (34 - 21 = 13). Therefore, the number of cows that arrived at the field is 13.
Response:  We are given that there were 7 trees in the forest before cutting down 3 of them. So, we have 7 - 3 = 4 remaining trees. Now, we are told that each tree has 59 branches. Therefore, the total number of branches after cutting down 3 trees is 4 x 59 = 236 branches. Finally, we are asked how many branches there are now on each tree. Since there are 20 trees left, the total number of branches on all 20 trees is 236 / 20 = 11 branches per tree. So, the answer is 11 branches per tree.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 13 trees in the forest and after Jessica planted more trees, there were 21 trees in total. So, we can calculate the number of new trees planted as follows:
New trees = Total trees after Jessica - Initial number of trees
= 21 - 13
= 8
Therefore, Jessica planted 8 additional trees in the forest."
Response:  We are given that there were 15 warids at maau 1 and 62 orkdis at maau 62. Since Jessica took more than half of the orkdis from her basket, she had 38 orkdis left (since 38 is half of 62). Now, let's calculate how many warids Jessica had after taking the orkdis from her basket. If we subtract the number of orkdis taken (38) from the total number of warids (15), we get 12 warids remaining with Jessica (15 - 38 = 12). Therefore, the answer to the question is 12.
Response:  We are given that there were 12 warids and 2 orkidis at the starting point of the race. Since Jessica was ahead of the other runners, she covered more distance than them. So, after covering some distance, she had 10 warids behind her, and 21 orkidis in front of her. Therefore, the number of orkidis ahead of Jessica is 21 - 2 = 19.
Response:  We have been given that there are 5 warids and 3 orchids in one basket. So, we can say that each warid has 5 - 3 = 2 orchids with it. Now, Jessica picked more than 12 warids from the basket, so she must have taken at least 12 x 2 = 24 orchids along with her. Therefore, the number of orchids left behind is 3 - 24 = -21 orchids. Since negative numbers cannot be used to represent quantities, let us round off the answer to zero orchids were left behind after Jessica took away the warids.
Response:  We have been given that there were 7 warids in total and they were divided into two groups of 3 each. In group A, we had 4 warids (Warid 1, Warid 2, Warid 5, and Warid 6), while in group B, we had 3 warids (Warid 3, Warid 4, and Warid 7). Now, let's count the number of orchids in each group: Group A has 4 orchids (Orchid 1, Orchid 2, Orchid 3, and Orchid 4) and Group B has 3 orchids (Orchid 5, Orchid 6, and Orchid 7). Therefore, the total number of orchids is 4 + 3 = 7. So, the answer to the question is 7.
Response:  We have 19 waridi in total and we want to know how many will be left after 3 of them are taken from the group that is located near the tree. So, if we take 3 waridi from the group of 19, then the remaining number of waridi will be 16 (19 - 3). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We are given that there were 13 cows in one field and 84 cows in another field. Also, we know that Jessica took more than half of the cows from her own field to the other field. So, she had 91 cows left in her original field after taking some to the other field. Therefore, the number of cows she took to the other field is equal to the difference between the total number of cows in the two fields minus the number of cows she left in her original field. In this case, it would be 84 - 91 = -7. So, Jessica did not take any cows from the other field to her original field.
Response:  We have been given that there are 16 warids and 3 orkidis in total. From Jessica's perspective, she has seen more than 16 warids because she saw 7 warids after coming from her own backyard. So, the number of warids she saw is greater than 16. Now, we need to find out how many orkidis were left after Jessica saw the warids. Since there were 3 orkidis initially, and Jessica saw 7 warids, then the number of orkidis left is equal to the initial number minus the number of warids Jessica saw. Therefore, the answer is 3 - 7 = -4 orkidis.
Response:  We have been given that there are 6 warids in total and each warid has 5 orkides. So, the total number of orkides is 6 x 5 = 30. Now, we know that Jessica has taken 2 more orkides than what is left with her after taking all the orkides from the basket. Therefore, the remaining orkides in the basket are 30 - 2 = 28.
Response:  We have been given that there are 9 warids and 6 orkdis in total. From Jessica's bag, she took out 4 more warids, leaving her with 5 remaining. Then, from the other bag, she took out 2 more orkdis, leaving them with 8 remaining. So, the final number of warids is 9 - 5 = 4, and the final number of orkdis is 6 - 8 = -2. Therefore, there are no orkdis left in the second bag.
"Response:  We are given that ""Nywele za Robin zilikuwa urefu wa inchi 17"". This means that Robin has 17 eggs. Now we are asked to find out how many chicks were hatched from these eggs. The question states, ""Ikiwa sasa nywele zake ni urefu wa inchi 13"", which means that after 13 days, the number of chicks hatched is equal to the number of eggs laid. Therefore, the number of chicks hatched = Number of eggs laid (17). So the answer is 13."
Response:  If Robin has 20 new notebooks and each notebook contains 10 pages, then the total number of pages Robin has is 20 x 10 = 200 pages. Now, if he wants to know how many pages he will have after using 5 pages from each notebook, we need to subtract 5 pages from the total number of pages he has, which is 200 pages. So, the final number of pages Robin will have is 200 - (5 x 20) = 200 - 100 = 100 pages.
Response:  We are given that Robin scored 16 points and he got 11 correct answers. The remaining questions were worth 12 marks each. Therefore, if we calculate the total score for the remaining questions, it will be (12 x 9) = 108 marks. So, the final score of Robin is 16 + 11 + 108 = 134 marks.
"Response:  If Robin scored 18 out of 20 in his previous test, and he got an additional mark of 3 for the current test, then...

Total marks obtained by Robin = 18 + 3 = 21
So, the percentage score obtained by Robin is:
Percentage score = (Total marks / Total number of questions) x 100
= (21 / 40) x 100 = 52.5%
Therefore, the correct answer is 52.5%."
Response:  If there are 13 new words and each word has 5 letters, then the total number of letters is 13 x 5 = 65. Since we were given that the length of the longest word is 14 letters, we can deduce that the length of the shortest word is 65 - 14 = 51 letters. Therefore, the answer is 51.
Response:  We are given that Robin scored 14 points and lost by 6 points. So, Robin's score was 14 + (6 - 8) = 14 + (-4) = 10. Therefore, Robin scored 10 points.
Response:  We are given that there are 12 kittens in the basket and 53 birds in the tree. So, we can say that each bird is carrying one kitten. Therefore, the number of birds carrying kittens = Total number of birds - Number of birds in the tree. = 53 - 12 = 41 birds.
Response:  If Danny had 21 cats and gave 5 of them to Vikorokoro, then he has 21 - 5 = 16 cats left. Since Vikorokoro also got 5 cats from Danny, the total number of cats that Vikorokoro has is 5 + 5 = 10 cats. Therefore, the final answer is 16 (the number of cats left with Danny) minus 10 (the number of cats received by Vikorokoro), which gives us 6 cats.
Response:  We are given that Danny had 63 cents in his pocket at one time and he spent 51 of them buying something. So, after spending money, he was left with 12 cents (63 - 51 = 12). Now, he got another 33 cents from someone else. Therefore, Danny now has a total of 45 cents (12 + 33 = 45)
Response:  We are given that Danny had 36 cats in his backyard at one time and he fed them for 35 days. Then he lost 22 cats to other people. So, how many cats does Danny have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cats he lost (22) from the total number of cats he had initially (36). Therefore, the answer is 14 cats.
Response:  The number of days that passed between when Danny started digging and he finished is 63 - 30 = 33 days. So, if it took him 42 days to complete the hole in the forest, then he dug more quickly than he did before. Therefore, the answer is (42 / 33) x 100 = 131%.
Response:  We are given that there were 22 vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko at first and then 8 more vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko appeared in the bushes. This means that initially, there were 22 + 8 = 30 vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko. Then, another 28 vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko appeared in the market. So, finally, there were 30 + 28 = 58 vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko. Therefore, Danny had 58 vikorokoro vying for his attention.
Response:  The number of vikorokoro that were not in the list is equal to the difference between the total number of vikorokoro and the number of vikorokoro that were in the list. In this case, there are 22 vikorokoro in the list, so we subtract them from the total number of vikorokoro which is 57. Therefore, the number of vikorokoro that were not in the list is 35 (57 - 22).
Response:  The number of pencils in Danny's bag is 30 and he has used 7 of them so far. To find out how many are left, we need to subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils in the bag. So, the number of pencils left in Danny's bag is: 30 - 7 = 23. Therefore, Danny has more pencils left in his bag than what he used at Mkusanyiko Wake.
Response:  The number of pineapples in one bunch is 11 and there are 28 bunches in total. Therefore, the total number of pineapples = 11 x 28 = 308. Now, we are asked how many more pineapples there are in the market compared to the farm. So, if there were 68 pineapples in the market, then there are (68 - 308) = -240 pineapples less in the market than in the farm.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 71 birds in the forest and after some time, 24 of them flew away. Then, another 16 birds arrived at the same spot where the previous ones had been. So, the total number of birds now is:  71 - 24 + 16 = 31. Therefore, there are currently 31 birds in the forest.
Response:  We are given that there were 10 vikorokoros (birds) in total and 62 of them died in the forest. Then, we are told that out of these remaining birds, 27 vikorokoros (birds) died in the market place. So, the number of vikorokoros left after this is: Total Number of Birds = 10 - 62 + 27 = 95 birds. Therefore, the correct answer is 95.
Response:  The number of trees in the forest is 66. After cutting down 25 trees, how many are left? So, the remaining number of trees = 66 - 25 = 41. Therefore, Danny has 41 trees.
Response:  If there were initially 32 beads in the jar and Danny took out 10 beads, then there are left with 22 beads in the jar. Now if he takes out another 5 beads, there will be 17 beads remaining in the jar. Therefore, the final number of beads that Danny will have is 17.
Response:  We are given that Danny had 60 apples in his basket after 6 hours and he gave away 58 of them. So, he has 2 apples left in his basket. Now, we are asked how many apples Danny would have if he got another apple every hour for 1 hour. Therefore, Danny will get 6 new apples (1 hour x 6 = 6). So, at the end of 1 hour, Danny will have 2 + 6 = 8 apples in his basket.
Response:  We are given that initially there were 6 birds in the tree and after 6 hours, 50 more birds came to the tree. So, now we have 6 + 50 = 56 birds in the tree. After another 6 hours (i.e., total time = 12 hours), let's assume that 30 more birds come to the tree, so now we have 56 + 30 = 86 birds in the tree. Therefore, the final number of birds in the tree is 86.
Response:  The number of pebbles in the bag at first was 54 and then it decreased to 48 after some were taken out. Later, 16 more pebbles were added to the bag, making its current total count 52. Therefore, the final answer is 52.
"Response:  We are given that there were 82 people who took part in the race and completed it, out of whom 29 finished in the first position. Therefore, the number of people who finished in the second position is 82 - 29 = 53. Now, we are also told that among these 53 runners, 42 finished in the third position, which means that the number of runners who finished in the fourth position is 53 - 42 = 11. Finally, we are informed that among these 11 runners, Danny was the one who finished in the fifth position. So, the answer to the question ""Danny anakusanya vikorokoro vya chupa na vifuniko"" is 11."
Response:  We are given that there were 66 birds in total and 39 of them flew away. So, the remaining birds were 27 (66 - 39). Then, we are told that 16 of these remaining birds flew away again, leaving 10 (27 - 16) birds behind. Therefore, Danny had 10 birds under his care at the end.
Response:  Vifuniko 46 na vikorokoro 50 means that there are 9 more vifuniko in total than vikorokoro. So, the total number of vifuniko is 46 + 9 = 55. Now, we have to find out how many vifuniko Danny has taken from the total number of vifuniko available. From the question, it is clear that Danny took 21 vifuniko which is less than half of the total number of vifuniko available (55). Therefore, Danny took 21/55 x 100 = 38% of the total number of vifuniko available.
Response:  We know that Danny had 65 marbles in his pocket and gave away 5 of them to someone else. So he has 65 - 5 = 60 marbles left. Then he met another person who gave him 31 marbles, so now he has 60 + 31 = 91 marbles in total. Therefore, the number of marbles Mangapi gave to Danny is 91 - 31 = 60 marbles.
Response:  We are given that there are 58 vikorokoros in total and 25 of them are located in the forest. So, the number of vikorokoros outside the forest is 58 - 25 = 33. Now, we are told that 11 vikorokoros have been found inside the village, so the number of vikorokoros left to find inside the village is 11 / 2 = 5. Therefore, the number of vikorokoros remaining outside the forest after finding 11 inside the village is 33 - 5 = 28.
Response:  We are given that there were 15 people who took chupa (chewed) paan and spat out the juice into a container with 18 holes at the bottom in a garden. Then, we are told that Danny chewed 67 pieces of paan and spat out the juice into a container with 35 holes at the bottom in a different place. To find out how many more paans Danny chewed than the others, we need to subtract the number of paans he chewed from the total number of paans chewed by all the other people. So, the answer is: 67 - 15 = 52. Therefore, Danny chewed 52 more paans than the others.
Response:  If Jake is 17 years old and he has been working for 4 years, then his age at the time of starting work was 13 years old (Jake - 4 = 13). Now, if we subtract the age of Steven (Steven - 11 = 6), we get the difference in their ages. So, the answer to the question is 6 years.
Response:  We know that Jake and Machungwa have 7 children together. If Steven has 14 more children than Jake, then Jake must have had 21 children in total (7 + 14 = 21). So, Jake had 21 children.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 friends and Machungwa is one of them. So, there are 17 remaining friends who are not Machungwa. Now we need to find out how many friends Steven has. According to the passage, Steven has 13 more friends than Jake, which means he has 13 + 18 = 31 friends in total. Therefore, Jill has 19 - 31 = -12 friends.
Response:  We know that Jake and Machungwa have 3 children each. So in total, they have 6 children between them. Now we are told that Steven has 8 more children than Jake. This means that if Jake has x children, then Steven has x + 8 children. Therefore, Jake has 3 children, and Steven has 11 children (x + 8). So Jake does not have more children than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake scored 12 points and Machungwa scored 11 points more than Jake. So, if we subtract 11 from Jake's score, we get Machungwa's score. Therefore, Jill scored 4 points more than Machungwa. The answer is (4).
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 apples and gives 3 to Steven. So, Jake now has 7 - 3 = 4 apples left. Then, Steven gets 9 more apples from Jake, so he now has 9 + 3 = 12 apples in total. Finally, Jill gets 5 apples from Steven, so she now has 12 - 5 = 7 apples in total. Therefore, Jake has 4 apples left after giving some to Steven and Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake scored 7 points more than Steven and Jill scored 8 points less than Steven. So, if Steven scored x points, then Jake scored x + 7 points and Jill scored x - 8 points. Now we are given that Jake scored 17 points. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (x + 7) = 17. Solving for x, we get x = 9. So, Steven scored 9 points.
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 friends and Machungwa is one of them. So, there are 9 + 1 = 10 people in total including Machungwa. Now we know that Steven has 18 friends and Machungwa is not among them. Therefore, there are 18 - 1 = 17 people left who are not Machungwa. Finally, we know that Jill has 16 friends. So, the number of people remaining after subtracting those who are not Machungwa from the total number of people (including Machungwa) is 17 - 16 = 1. Hence, the answer is 1.
Response:  If Jill has 18 years old and she was 5 years younger than Steven, then Steven is 23 years old (18 - 5 = 23).
Response:  If Jill has 87 years old and Jake is older than her by 18 years, then Jake's age would be 105 years old (18 + 87 = 105).
Response:  If Jill is currently 15 years old and she was 12 years old when Jake was 16 years old, then we can calculate how many years have passed since Jill was 12 using the following formula: Age difference = Current age - Original age. In this case, the current age of Jill is 15 and her original age was 12, so the age difference between them now is: Age difference = 15 - 12 = 3 years. Therefore, Jill has aged three years more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 kids and each of them weighs 79 kg more than Steven. So, if Steven weighs x kg, then Jake's weight is 12x + 79 kg. Now, we are told that Jake weighs less than 19 kg more than Steven. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 12x + 79 = 19x + y, where y is the difference between Jake's weight and Steven's weight. Solving for y, we get y = -50 kg. So, Jake weighs 12x + 79 - 50 = 79 kg.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 apples and he gives 3 to Steven. So, Jake now has 10 apples left (13 - 3 = 10). Then, we know that Steven has 9 apples plus the 8 apples he gets from Jake, so Steven has a total of 17 apples (9 + 8 = 17). Therefore, Jake has 10 apples left after giving some to Steven.
Response:  We are given that Jake has 6 kids and Machungwa has 8 kids. So, in total, they have 6 + 8 = 14 children. Now we are asked if Steven has more than 14 children. Since Steven has 17 children, he indeed has more than 14 children. Therefore, the correct answer is yes.
Response:  We know that Jake has three kids and each of them weighs 10 kg more than Steven. So, Jake's total weight is 3 x 10 = 30 kg more than Steven's weight. Therefore, Jake's weight is 45 + 30 = 75 kg. Now, let's find out how much heavier Machungwa is than Steven. Since Machungwa weighs 12 kg more than Jake, he must weigh 75 - 12 = 63 kg less than Steven. Thus, Machungwa is 63 kg heavier than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 4 apples and Steven has 12 apples. So, if we want to find out how many apples Jake has after giving 6 of them to Steven, we can start with the total number of apples Jake had initially (4) and subtract the number of apples he gave to Steven (6). Therefore, Jake has 4 - 6 = -2 apples after giving them to Steven.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 apples and Jake has 12 apples. So, if we take away 8 apples from Steven, he will have 10 apples left (18 - 8 = 10). Now, let's check how many apples Jill has after taking away 4 apples from her collection of 16 apples (16 - 4 = 12). Therefore, Jill has 12 apples remaining.
Response:  We know that Steven scored 72 points more than Jake. So if Jake scored x points, then Steven scored (x + 72) points. Therefore, Jake scored 72 points less than Steven. So Jake scored 64 points (since 72 - 72 = 0).
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 mangoes and Jake has 6 mangoes. So, if we take 3 more mangoes from Steven, he will have 11 mangoes left (14 - 3 = 11). Now, let's give those 3 mangoes to Jake, so he will have 9 mangoes in total (6 + 3 = 9). As for Jill, she doesn't get any mangoes since the total number of mangoes is already less than what she wanted (3). Therefore, Jill does not get any mangoes.
Response:  We know that Steven has 10 apples and he gave 3 to Jake. So, now Jake has 7 apples (7 = 10 - 3). Now we are told that Jake has 84 apples in total. Therefore, the number of apples Jake had before he got any from Steven is 84 - 7 = 77.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more than Steven. So, if Steven had 17 apples, then Jake would have 13 + 17 = 30 apples. Therefore, Jake has 30 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 kids and each of them weighs 10 kg more than Steven. So, if Steven weighs x kg, then Jake's youngest child will weigh x + 10 kg. Now, let's find out how many children Jake has in total. According to the question, Jake has 8 children plus Machungwa who is 18 years old. Therefore, the total number of people in Jake's family is 8 + 18 = 26.
Response:  We are given that Jake has 3 kids and Machungwa has 4 more than Steven. So, if we let S be the number of children Steven has, then Jake has 3S children. Moreover, Machungwa has 4 more than Steven, so Machungwa has (3S + 4) children. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Machungwa has and the number of children Steven has is equal to 4. Hence, the answer is 4.
Response:  We are given that there were 78 dogs in the area of Olivia and each dog had 15 puppies. Therefore, we have: Total number of puppies = Number of dogs x Number of puppies per dog Total number of puppies = 78 x 15 = 1170 puppies
Response:  If there are 78 patients in the hospital and each patient has 33 relatives, then the total number of people who came to visit is: 78 x 33 = 2590.
Response:  We are given that $K = 100$ and $A = 148$. To find out how many times $K$ can be divided into $A$, we need to divide $K$ by $A$. So, $K/A = 100/148 = 0.67$. Therefore, there are $\text{round}(0.67) = 7$ times that $K$ can be divided into $A$.
Response:  If Olivia withdrew $3 from her account at an ATM and then she added $49 more to her account through another transaction, the total amount in her account would be $52 (not $49). Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia has in her account after adding the $49 is $52.
"Response: 
Dola 53 - Dola 91 = Sh 38 (subtracting the amount withdrawn from the initial balance)
Sh 38 - Sh 14 = Sh 24 (the remaining balance after paying the bill)"
Response:  We are given that there were 106 people in total and they were divided into two groups of equal size (vyakula). Each group had to carry 49 bags of rice each. So, if we divide 106 by 2, we get the number of people in each group = 53. Since each group had to carry 49 bags of rice, the number of bags carried by each person = 49/53 = 0.9. Therefore, the answer is 0.9 or approximately 1 bag per person.
Response:  If Olivia had 30 dukas and gave away 17 of them, then she has 13 dukas left. Now, if she gives away another 16 dukas, how many does she have left? So, she will have 13 - 16 = -3 dukas left. Therefore, the correct answer is -3.
Response:  If there were 38 patients in the hospital and each patient had 128 beds, then the total number of beds in the hospital would be: 38 x 128 = 4760 beds. Therefore, if the hospital made a profit of Kshs 5 million per day, the amount of money made per bed per day would be: 4760 x Kshs 5,000,000 = Kshs 23,800,000 per day.
Response:  If Dave was in program number 19 and he moved to program number 5, then the difference between the two programs is 14 (program number 19 - program number 5). So, the answer is 14.
Response:  We know that there are 20 people in total and after 18 rounds of the game, only 5 remained. So, we can calculate the probability as follows: Probability = Number of remaining players / Total number of players x 100 = 5/20 x 100 = 25%
Response:  If Dave was in program 10 and he switched to program 11 after that, then he would have been in program 11 for some time before switching back to program 4. So, if we assume that he spent an equal amount of time in each program (which is not necessarily true), then the total time he spent in programs 1-4 can be calculated as follows: Time in program 1 = 10 - 11 = -1 days Time in program 2 = 11 - 4 = 7 days Time in program 3 = 4 - 10 = -6 days Time in program 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 days Therefore, the total time Dave spent in programs 1-4 is 7 + (-6) + 6 = 7 days.
Response:  If Dave had been in the first program (program 21), he would have completed it after 21 days. After completing the program, he joined another program (program 89) and took 30 days to complete it. Then he left that program and joined yet another one (program 24). To determine how many days he spent in each program, we can use the following formula: Total number of days = Number of days in each program x Number of programs. In this case, the total number of days is: Total number of days = 21 + 30 + 24 = 75 days. Therefore, Dave spent more than 75 days in different programs after leaving the first one.
Response:  The number of programs in the first set is 15 and after discarding some, there are 7 left. If we take another 7 from the second set, then the remaining programs will be 14. So, the difference between the two sets is 3 (7 - 4 = 3).
"Response:  We know that Dave had 16 programs and failed 77 of them in his simulation. After failing those programs, he got 5 new ones with 23 failures. So, if we calculate the total number of programs Dave had after getting the new ones, it would be:

16 + 5 = 21

So, Dave had 21 programs in total after getting the new ones."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 17 programs and failed 21 of them in his simulation. After failing some of the programs, he got 3 new ones and failed 7 more. So, if we calculate the total number of programs Dave has now, it would be:

17 - 21 = -4 (failed programs)
-4 + 3 = 1 (new programs)
1 + 7 = 8 (total number of programs)
Therefore, Dave has 8 programs left after failing some and getting new ones."
Response:  The number of students in the first group was 15 and they failed 24 subjects. After re-taking those exams, there were 21 students who passed and had 4 more failing subjects. So, if we add up all the passing students from both groups, we get 35 (21 + 14). Therefore, the total number of students who passed is 35.
Response:  The number of students in the first group is 19 and they scored an average of 18 points in the mock examination. After failing some of them, there were 6 students left with an average score of 15 points. To find out how many more points the remaining students scored than the original group, we subtract the average score of the failed group from the average score of the remaining group: (15 - 18) = -3. Therefore, the remaining students scored fewer points than the original group by 3 points.
Response:  If there were 17 students in the simulation and after completing the bad habit, there were 18 students, then we can conclude that one student joined the simulation later. Therefore, the answer is (1).
Response:  The number of students in the first group was 59 and they were enrolled in program 15. After some students failed, there were only 48 students left in the first group. Then, 12 new students joined the first group, bringing the total number to 60. Finally, another 30 students joined the second group, making the total number of students in both groups 90. Therefore, the final answer is 90.
Response:  We know that there were initially 24 students in the program and after failing some of them, there were 17 remaining students. Then, another student failed, leaving us with 21 students. So, the final number of students who did not fail is 21.
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 hours in his program and he failed 9 of them. After failing those hours, he got 5 more hours from the program. So, if we subtract the number of hours he failed (9) from the total number of hours in the program (24), we get 15 remaining hours. Now, let's assume that Dave got an additional 3 hours from the program, bringing the total to 18 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 programs and failed 3 of them in his simulation. After failing those three programs, he had 8 remaining programs. Now, we are told that among these 8 remaining programs, there were 24 programs that were run twice. So, the total number of programs that Dave ran in his simulation is: 8 + 24 = 32 programs. Therefore, the answer is 32.
Response:  We are given that Alikuwa had 242 points and Jeff had 136 points. To find out how many points Nell has, we can subtract the number of points that Alikuwa had from the total number of points (578). So, Nell has 578 - 242 = 336 points.
Response:  We are given that Jeff had $301 and he gave $154 to Nell. So, Nell now has $301 - $154 = $147.
Response:  We know that Jeff had 11 votes initially and lost 376 votes to become the runner-up with 252 votes. Now, we need to find out how many votes Nell got in total. Since she won the election with 528 votes, we can deduce that she gained 376 votes from Jeff (the difference between her vote count and his). So, Nell got 376 + 11 = 407 votes in total.
Response:  We are given that Ali had 566 votes and Jeff had 234 votes initially. Then, after some counting errors were discovered, Jeff gained 101 additional votes, bringing his total to 335 votes. Finally, we are told that Jeff now has 535 valid votes. To find out how many votes Jeff gained from Ali, we can subtract Ali's initial number of votes (566) from Jeff's new total (535): 535 - 566 = -131. So, Jeff lost 131 votes.
Response:  The total number of votes for all candidates is 309 + 10 x 356 = 2786. Now, we know that Jeff got 415 votes and there are 10 candidates in total. So, the number of votes each candidate received can be calculated as follows: Total votes / Number of candidates = Vote share per candidate. Therefore, the vote share per candidate is 2786/10 = 278.6. Since this is not a whole number, let's round it up to the nearest integer which gives us 280 votes per candidate.
Response:  The first number is 246 and the second number is 10214. To find out how many more than 10000 there are, we subtract 1000 from each of them:  246 - 1000 = 1464 10214 - 1000 = 9214 Now let's add these two numbers together to get the total number of more than 10000: 1464 + 9214 = 10678 Therefore, there are 10678 more than 10000.
Response:  We know that Nell had 573 beads and gave some to John who had 195 beads. Then she got more beads from Jeff (who has 210 beads) and now has 210 beads herself. So, Nell has 210 - 195 = 15 beads left after giving some to John and getting more from Jeff.
Response:  We are given that Jeff has 55 cards for each of the first 10 rounds and 178 cards for the remaining rounds (for a total of 233 cards). Now, we need to find out how many cards Nell has. Since Nell has more cards than Jeff, we can start with Nell's cards. So, let's say Nell has x cards. Then, since Jeff has fewer cards than Nell, we know that x + 55 = 233. Solving for x, we get x = 168. Therefore, Nell has 168 cards in addition to the ones he already had before the game started.
Response:  The number of cows owned by Jeff is 10 x 38 = 380. The number of goats owned by Mpira is 239 + 10 x 37 = 459. Therefore, the difference between the number of cows and goats owned by Mpira and Jeff is:  459 - 380 = 79. So, the number of cows owned by Mpira and Jeff is greater than the number of goats owned by Mpira and Jeff by 79.
Response:  We are given that Paco had $19 and he gave away $35 to his friend. So, what was left with him after giving away $35? To find out, we need to subtract $35 from $19. Therefore, the amount of money that Paco had left after giving away $35 is $19 - $35 = -$16.
Response:  We are given that Paco had 28 biscuits and he gave away 7 of them. So, we have to find out how many biscuits Paco has left after giving away 7. To do this, we need to subtract the number of biscuits he gave away (7) from the total number of biscuits he had (28). Therefore, the answer is: Paco has 21 biscuits left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 mikates initially and gave away 2 kati (which is equal to 8 mikates). So, he has 40 - 8 = 32 mikates left. Now, we are told that after giving away these 8 mikates, he received 37 more mikates as a gift. Therefore, his final amount of mikates would be 32 + 37 = 69 mikates.
"Response: 
Paco had 25 mikates initially. He gave away 5 of them to his friend. So he has 20 mikates left (25 - 5 = 20).
Now, if he gives away 3 more mikates, he will have 17 mikates left (20 - 3 = 17)."
"Response: 
Paco had 13 cats and gave 2 away to his friend Ali. So now he has 13 - 2 = 11 cats left.
Ali received 36 cats from someone else. If we subtract the number of cats that Ali already had (2), then Ali got 36 - 2 = 34 more cats.
So, the total number of cats that Paco and Ali have together is 11 + 34 = 45 cats."
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 biscuits and he gave away 5 to his friend who is 13 years old. So, how many biscuits does Paco have left? Well, if we subtract the number of biscuits he gave away (5) from the total number of biscuits he had (40), we get 35. Therefore, Paco has 35 biscuits left.
"Response: 
Paco had 17 friends and gave each of them 14 sweets. He was left with 2 sweets (13 - 14 = -1). So he shared one sweet with his remaining friend, leaving him with no sweets (-1). Therefore, Paco shared 15 sweets in total (17 - 2 = 15)."
"Response: 
Paco had $12 and gave $4 to his friend. So, Paco now has $8 left.
His friend then gave him $10 more, so now Paco has $18 ($8 + $10).
Now, another friend gave him $3 more, so now Paco has $21 ($18 + $3).
Therefore, the correct answer is $21."
Response:  We are given that Paco had 22 biscuits in total and he gave away 75 biscuits as gifts. So, his remaining biscuits were 75 - 22 = 53 biscuits. Now, we are told that he also shared some of these biscuits with his friend Ali, who received 15 biscuits from him. Therefore, after sharing the biscuits with Ali, Paco was left with 53 - 15 = 38 biscuits. Finally, we are asked if Paco has any biscuits left over (ngapi). Since he has already given away 75 biscuits and only has 38 biscuits left, the answer is yes, Paco has some biscuits left over (ngapi).
"Response:  We are given that Paco had 9 biscuits in total and he gave 6 to his friend Chumvi. So, Paco has 3 remaining biscuits (9 - 6 = 3). Now we are told that Chumvi also received 3 biscuits from Paco. Therefore, the number of biscuits left with Paco after giving them to Chumvi is 3 - 3 = 0 biscuits. So, the correct answer is ""ngapi"" which means zero."
Response:  We have two groups of people with different amounts of bread: Group A has 37 pieces of bread and group B has 11 pieces of bread. Additionally, we know that group A has 5 more pieces of bread than group B. So, if we subtract the number of pieces of bread in group B from the total number of pieces of bread in group A, we will get the difference between the two groups. Therefore, the answer is: 37 - 11 = 26.
"Response:  We have two types of biscuits - Tamu and Chumvi. The number of biscuits for each type is given as follows:
Tamu: 8 + 20 = 28
Chumvi: 6 + 34 = 40
Now, we need to find out which one has more biscuits. To do this, we add up all the numbers of biscuits for both types:
Total biscuits = 28 (Tamu) + 40 (Chumvi) = 68
Therefore, the total number of biscuits is 68. So, the answer is (D)."
Response:  If there were 37 mikes in total and Paco had 36 of them, then he missed one mike. So, the correct answer is (37 - 36) = 1.
Response:  We know that Paco had 36 biscuits and he gave some to his friend who took 14 of them. So, how many did Paco have left? Well, if he had 36 - 14 = 22 biscuits remaining. Then, we are told that one of his friends took 10 more biscuits from him. So, now Paco has 22 - 10 = 12 biscuits left. Therefore, the number of biscuits left with Paco is 12.
Response:  The total number of biscuits is 41. If Paco took 9 biscuits and his friend took 18 biscuits, then the remaining biscuits are 24 (41 - 9 - 18). So, the correct answer is 24.
"Response: 
Paco had $6 and gave $30 to his friend. Then he took back $23 from his friend. So, the amount of money that Paco has now is:
$6 - $30 + $23 = $17
Therefore, the correct answer is $17."
Response:  We are given that Paco had 97 biscuits of one type and 34 biscuits of another type. Additionally, he gave away 15 biscuits to someone else. So, how many biscuits does Paco have left? Well, if we subtract the number of biscuits he gave away (15) from the total number of biscuits he had (97 + 34), we get 82. Therefore, the correct answer is 82.
Response:  We are given that Paco had 26 biscuits at first and then he gave some to his friend who had 17 biscuits. After this, Paco was left with 14 biscuits and then he shared them equally among three people, including himself, leaving him with 9 biscuits. So, the number of biscuits Paco has now is 9. Therefore, the answer is (9).
"Response:  We have two sets of numbers:  
Set A (biskuiti tamu): 39 + 32 = 71 Set B (biskuiti chumvi): 6 + 23 = 29 Total number of biscuits in both sets is equal to 71 + 29 = 100 So, there are more than 100 biscuits in total."
"Response:  We have two quantities of biscuits - one is 40 and the other is 25. So, we can write their difference as follows:
Difference = 40 - 25 = 15
Now, we are given another quantity of biscuits which is 28. To find out how many more biscuits than the previous ones, we need to subtract 28 from 15:
More biscuits = 28 - 15 = 13
Therefore, there are 13 more biscuits in the new batch than in the old batch."
Response:  We are given that Gwen earned $7 and spent $5 with 7 people. To find out how much money Gwen has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she earned. So, the answer is: $7 - $5 = $2.
Response:  We are given that Gwen has 8 children and each child gets $10 from her. So, the total amount of money Gwen gives away is $80 (8 x $10). Now, we are also told that Gwen has 6 grandchildren who get $5 each from her. Therefore, the total amount of money Gwen gives away to all her descendants is $30 ($6 x $5). Finally, we are asked how much money Gwen keeps for herself after giving away this amount. Since she has no expenses, Gwen pockets the entire $80 she gave away, so she keeps $80.
Response:  According to the question, Gwen was given Sh100 by her mother and she spent Sh50 on sweets. This means that Gwen has Sh50 left. Now, if Gwen had taken Sh3 from her mother, then she would have had Sh50 - Sh3 = Sh47 remaining. Therefore, the answer is Sh47.
Response:  We are given that Gwen got $8 from her mother and $5 more than her father gave her. So, if we let x be the amount of money Gwen received from her father, then we can write an equation as follows: Gwen received $8 from her mother + $5 more than her father gave her = total amount of money she received. Now, we know that Gwen's father gave her $5 more than he gave to his wife (mother), so we can say that Gwen's father gave her $x - $5. Substituting this value into our original equation, we get: $8 + ($x - $5) = total amount of money Gwen received. Simplifying the equation, we get: $8 + $x = $13. Solving for $x, we find that Gwen received $10 from her father. Therefore, the correct answer is $10.
"Response:  We are given that Gwen has $10 and she gives $3 to her mother. Her mother then gives $6 more to Gwen. If Gwen had $4 initially, how much money will she have after receiving the additional amount from her mother?
So, if Gwen had $4 initially, and her mother gave her an additional $6, then Gwen now has $10 + $6 = $16."
Response:  We are given that Gwen has $10 and she gives $2 to her mother. Her mother then gives $3 to her father. So, Gwen now has $8 left. If Gwen had $4 initially, how much did she have after giving money to her mother? Therefore, Gwen had $4 + $2 = $6 after giving money to her mother.
Response:  If Gwen gave $10 to her father and he gave $5 to his mother, then Gwen has $10 - $5 = $5 left with her. Now, if Gwen gives $2 more to her father, she will have $5 - $2 = $3 left with her. So, the amount of money that Gwen's father received from Gwen is $3. Therefore, the answer is $3.
Response:  If Josh had 9 bullets in his gun and he shot 4 of them, then he has 5 bullets left (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had 21 bullets and gave away 12 of them, then he has 9 remaining bullets (21 - 12 = 9).
Response:  If Josh had 19 bullets and gave away 11 of them to his friends, he would have 8 bullets left (19 - 11 = 8). Then, if he gave 5 more bullets to another friend, he would be left with only 3 bullets (8 - 5 = 3). So, the final number of bullets that Josh has is 3.
Response:  If Josh has 4 bullets left for his gun and he shoots 8 more times, then he will have 4 + 8 = 12 bullets left in total. So, the correct answer is (12).
Response:  If Josh had 7 apples and gave away 2 to his friend, he would have 5 apples left. Then if he got 3 more apples as a gift from someone else, he would have 8 apples in total. Finally, if he shared 4 of those apples with another friend, he would be left with 10 apples. So, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  If Josh had 21 bullets and gave away 7, he would have __________ bullets left. (Fill in the blank with an appropriate number)
Response:  If Josh had 20 bullets and gave 2 to Jack, then he has 18 bullets left. So, the answer is 18.
Response:  If Josh had 22 bullets and gave away 5, he would have 17 left. Then, if Jack took 3 of those remaining bullets, Josh would be left with 14 bullets. So, the final number of bullets that Josh has is 14.
Response:  If there were 19 people in the group initially and one person left every minute, then after 11 minutes, there would be 19 x 11 = 205 people in the group. So, the answer is 205.
Response:  If Josh had 22 bullets and gave away 13 of them in one day, he would have 9 bullets left. Then if he gave away another 5 bullets later that same day, he would be left with 4 bullets. So the final number of bullets Josh has is 4.
Response:  If Josh had 15 bullets and gave away 9 of them, he would have 6 remaining (15 - 9 = 6). If he then gave away another 23 bullets, he would be left with nothing (6 - 23 = -17). So, the correct answer is -17.
Response:  If Josh had 3 bullets left in his gun and he shot 6 more times, then he would have used up all of his bullets. So, at this point, he has no bullets left. Now, if he were to shoot again, he would need to load another bullet into his gun. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) None.
Response:  We are given that Marco is 3 years older than his son. So, Marco's age is 3 + (son's age - 3) = 3 + 16 = 19 years old. Therefore, the correct answer is 19.
Response:  We are given that Marco had 40 bananas and he shared them equally among his friends who were 7 in number. So each friend got 6 bananas (40/7 = 6). Now we are asked how many bananas did Marco have after sharing them with his friends? Well, if Marco had 40 bananas initially and he shared them equally among 7 friends, then he would have 40 - 7 x 6 = 28 bananas left. Therefore, the correct answer is 28.
Response:  We are given that Marco has 5 soberi (stoberi) and his father has 8 soberi (stoberi). So, Marco's share of the total number of soberi is 5/13 = 0.385.
Response:  The number of days that Marco took to climb Mount Everest is 80 days. Therefore, the number of days that his father took to climb Mount Everest would be 80 x 3 = 240 days. So, the total number of days taken by both Marco and his father to climb Mount Everest together is 240 + 80 = 320 days.
Response:  We know that Marco had 24 eggs and he used 9 of them to make omelets for his guests. So, after using 9 eggs, he has 15 eggs left (24 - 9 = 15). Now, when Baba Yao came in, Marco gave him 3 eggs. So, now Marco has 18 eggs left (15 + 3 = 18). Therefore, the number of eggs Baba Yao took is 3.
Response:  We are given that Marco had 36 apples and he gave away 8 of them to his friend. So, Marco has 36 - 8 = 28 apples left. Then, in the next moment, he gave another 4 apples to his friend. So, Marco now has 28 - 4 = 24 apples left. Therefore, the number of apples Marco has left is 24.
Response:  We are given that Marco had 22 apples initially and he gave away 30 more apples after eating some. So, his remaining apples were 22 - 30 = -8 apples. Then, he ate another 10 apples, so now he has -8 + 10 = 2 apples left. Therefore, the number of apples Baba Yao has is 2 apples.
"Response:  The total number of stoveries for all the people is equal to the sum of the number of stoveries per person multiplied by the number of people. So, we have: Total no. of stoveries = (Number of stoveries per person x Number of people)
From the question, we know that each person has 15 stoveries and there are 4 people in total. Therefore, the total number of stoveries can be calculated as follows: Total no. of stoveries = (15 x 4) = 60
So, the answer is 60."
Response:  The total number of bananas Marco has is 30. Each banana weighs approximately 170 grams. So, the total weight of all the bananas Marco has is:  30 x 170 = 5100 grams. Therefore, the weight of each banana is: 5100 / 30 = 170 grams.
Response:  The total number of bananas eaten by all children is equal to the sum of their individual shares (uzito) multiplied by the total number of bananas they shared (stoberi). So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Uzito = 10 for Marco and 26 for all other children. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten by all children can be calculated as follows: Total no. of bananas eaten = (Marco's share x Total no. of bananas shared) + (Total no. of bananas shared x Baba Yake's share) Substituting the values, we get: Total no. of bananas eaten = (10 x 30) + (30 x 7) = 490 + 210 = 700 bananas. Therefore, the numerical answer to the question is 700.
Response:  The number of bananas eaten by Baba Yao is 11 and each banana has 30 peels. So, the total number of peels eaten by Baba Yao is:  11 x 30 = 330. Therefore, the answer is 330.
Response:  We have 10 children in total and each child has 5 sweets. So, we have a total of 50 sweets among all the children. Now, let's assume that one child takes 3 sweets from the basket, leaving 47 sweets remaining. Since there are 10 children, if we divide 47 sweets equally among them, each child will get 4.7 sweets (round off to 4 sweets). Therefore, the number of sweets left for the next child is 47 - 4 = 43 sweets.
Response:  We are given that there were 26 children who went to school without breakfast. Since each child had 38 bread pieces, and they shared them equally among themselves, then each child got 1.39 bread pieces (38/26). Now, since some of these children did not get any bread, we need to subtract the number of children who did not get any bread from the total number of children who went to school without breakfast. So, the remaining number of children who got bread is 26 - 5 = 21 children. Therefore, the answer is 21 children.
Response:  We have 41 children who are in need of basic necessities and we want to know how many will be left without anything after distributing what they receive equally among 2 other children. So, if we divide 41 by 2, we get 20.5. Since you cannot have a fraction of a child, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 21. Therefore, 21 children will be left without any basic necessity after distributing what they receive equally among 2 other children.
Response:  We are given that there were 43 children who went to school without breakfast. Out of these, 21 did not bring their lunch boxes. So, the number of children who brought their lunch boxes is 43 - 21 = 22.
Response:  The number of children who were not in school was 41. If we subtract the number of children who went to school from the total number of children, we get 33 (41 - 8). Therefore, there are 33 more children who will be affected if the government provides free primary education.
Response:  We are given that there were initially 21 children in the bus. From this number, 10 children got off the bus. So, the remaining number of children on the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Now, we are told that 4 more children got off the bus, so the total number of children who got off the bus is 4 + 10 = 14. Therefore, the final number of children left on the bus is 11 - 14 = -3.
Response:  We are given that there were 5 children who went to school early in the morning and they had breakfast. From among these 5 children, 63 more came later for lunch. Out of these additional 63 children, 14 walked alone to school. So, the total number of children who walked alone to school is 14 + 63 = 77. Therefore, the answer is 77.
Response:  We are given that there were 36 children who went to school with their lunch boxes. From this group of 36 children, 68 children walked back home carrying their lunch boxes. So, we have 68 - 36 = 32 children left behind at the school. Now, out of these 32 remaining children, 12 walked together holding hands. Therefore, the number of children who walked together holding hands is 12.
Response:  We are given that there were 22 children who went to school and out of them, 40 did not come back home. This means that 18 children did not return home. So, the number of children who returned home is 22 - 18 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We are given that there were 28 children who went to school with their lunch boxes. Out of these, 82 did not bring their lunch boxes. So, the number of children who brought their lunch boxes is 28 - 82 = -54. Therefore, the number of children who brought more than 30 lunch boxes is -54.
Response:  We are given that there were 23 children who went to school and 8 of them did not go back home. So, the number of children who went back home is 23 - 8 = 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  If there are 51 cats and each cat has 3 kittens, then the total number of kittens is 51 x 3 = 153. Therefore, the correct answer is 153.
Response:  If there are 54 students in total and each student has 13 zilizobaki (friends), then the number of friends for all the students is:  54 x 13 = 692. Therefore, the correct answer is 692.
"Response:  We are given that there are 145 cats in total and each cat has 72 kittens. So, we have to find out how many litters of cats are produced. To do this, we divide the number of cats (145) by the number of kittens per litter (72). This gives us the number of litters produced, which is:

145 / 72 = 3
Therefore, there are 3 litters of cats produced."
"Response:  If the friend of the baker has 140 kg and the baker wants to give him 155 kg, then we need to find out how much more weight the baker will give to his friend.
So, the difference between the weights is:
155 - 140 = 15 kg
Therefore, the baker will give his friend 15 kg extra weight."
Response:  We are given that there are 121 students in total and 105 of them have taken the exam so far. This means that 16 (121 - 105) students have not yet taken the exam. Therefore, the number of students who will take the exam is 16. So, the answer is 16.
Response:  We are given that there are 13 people in total and 9 of them have already taken the test (Aliuza). So, the number of people who haven't taken the test is 13 - 9 = 4. Now, we are asked how many more questions Baker will need to answer if he takes the test after everyone else has finished. Therefore, the number of questions Baker needs to answer is equal to the total number of questions minus the number of questions already answered by the other 9 people, which is 154 - 91 = 63 questions.
Response:  We are given that there are 170 students in total and 78 of them passed their exams with an average score of 31 marks per student. To find out how many students scored above 40 marks, we can use the following calculation: Total number of students who scored above 40 marks = Number of students who passed their exams x Average score of passing students - Total number of students who did not pass their exams (170 - 78) = 78 x 41 - 92 = 356 Therefore, there are 356 students who scored above 40 marks.
Response:  We are given that there are 110 buns in total and 75 of them have been eaten by the cat. So, the remaining number of buns is 110 - 75 = 35. Now, we are asked how many buns the baker has left. Since the baker has 76 buns in total, and 75 of them have already been eaten, the number of buns the baker has left is 76 - 75 = 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We are given that there are 144 students in total and 71 of them passed the examination. Therefore, the number of students who did not pass is equal to 144 - 71 = 73. Now we are asked how many more students failed than passed. So, the difference between the number of students who passed and those who failed is 73 - 71 = 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We are given that there are 149 people in total and 91 of them have taken vitamin supplements. This means that 58 (149 - 91) people have not taken vitamin supplements. Now, we are also told that among those who have taken vitamin supplements, 10 have not taken enough. Therefore, the number of people who have taken sufficient vitamin supplements is 91 - 10 = 81. So, Baker has 81 people under his care.
"Response:  We are given that there are 7 kilograms of rice and 148 grams of beans. To find out how many cups of beans are in 148 grams, we can use the conversion factor between grams and cups. There are approximately 200 grams in one cup of dry beans. So, to convert 148 grams to cups, we divide by 200:

148 g / 200 = 0.74 cups
Now, let's calculate the number of cups of beans needed to make 15 kg of beans. Since there are 0.74 cups of beans per kilogram, we can multiply the weight of beans (in kilograms) by the number of cups per kilogram:

15 kg x 0.74 cups/kg = 11 cups
Therefore, if Baker has 15 kg of beans, they have 11 cups of beans."
Response:  We are given that baker has 126 cookies and he wants to share them equally among 48 friends. So, each friend will get x cookies where x = 126/48 = 2.75 cookies per friend. Now, if there were 115 cookies left after sharing with the first group of 48 friends, then the remaining number of cookies would be 115 - (2.75 x 48) = 115 - 130 = -15 cookies. Therefore, the correct answer is -15 cookies.
Response:  We are given that there are 19 bakers and each of them can make 131 bread rolls per hour. If one baker makes 70 bread rolls in an hour, then the total number of bread rolls made by all the bakers is 19 x 131 = 2499. Therefore, the difference between the total number of bread rolls made by all the bakers and the number of bread rolls made by one baker in an hour is 2499 - 70 = 2429.
"Response:  The difference between 157 and 169 is 12. Similarly, the difference between 158 and 147 is also 12. Therefore, if we subtract the smaller number from the larger number in both cases, we get:

(169 - 12) = 157
(147 - 12) = 135

So, the answer to the question is 135."
Response:  We are given that baker has 54 cookies and he wants to share them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 13 cookies (54/4 = 13). Now, we are also given that Alice has 68 cookies and she wants to share them equally among 7 people. So, each person will get 9 cookies (68/7 = 9). Therefore, if Alice had more cookies than the baker, then each person would get more cookies from Alice than from the baker.
Response:  If there were 48 mangoes and he picked 12, then he has 36 left (48 - 12 = 36). Now, if he gave away 9 of those remaining mangoes to his friend, then he has 27 mangoes left (36 - 9 = 27). So, the answer is 27.
Response:  If there were 40 people in the queue and each person took an average of 5 minutes to serve, then the total time taken would be 40 x 5 = 200 minutes or 3 hours. Therefore, if more than 100 people joined the queue after that, it would take longer for them to get served because the total waiting time has increased from 3 hours to (3 + x) hours where x is the number of additional people who joined the queue.
Response:  If Rafiki was originally carrying 137 eggs and he dropped 169 of them, then he has 137 - 169 = -32 eggs left in his basket. So, Baker Angebakiwa na keki ngapi means that Baker will have no eggs left in his basket.
Response:  We are given that there are 173 students in total and 103 of them passed their exams with 86 getting distinction. So, we can calculate the number of students who did not pass as follows: Number of students who didn't pass = Total number of students - Number of students who passed with distinction Number of students who didn't pass = 173 - 86 = 87 Therefore, the baker has 87 students who didn't pass their exams.
Response:  We are given that there are 99 bakers and each of them makes 167 loaves per day. Therefore, the total number of loaves made by all the bakers is:  99 x 167 = 16533. Now, we are also told that Baker alitengeneza has 89 loaves left after selling his products. So, the remaining loaves with Baker alitengeneza are: 89. Subtracting this from the total number of loaves made by all the bakers gives us the number of loaves left with Baker alitengeneza: 16533 - 89 = 16444.
Response:  We are given that the number of students in class A is 139 and the number of students who passed with grade C+ is 145. To find out how many more students passed with grade C+ than those who did not pass, we subtract the number of students who did not pass from the number of students who passed:  145 - 139 = 6 Therefore, six more students passed with grade C+ than those who did not pass.
"Response:  We are given that there are 62 bakers and each of them can make 144 cookies. Therefore, in total, we have:

62 bakers x 144 cookies/baker = 8736 cookies
So, the answer is 8736 cookies."
Response:  The number of bakers is 81 and each baker has 46 cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes produced by all bakers is 81 x 46 = 3576. Now, let's find out how many more cakes are produced by Baker than any other baker. So, we subtract the number of cakes produced by Baker from the total number of cakes produced by all bakers: 3576 - 46 = 3530. Therefore, Baker produces 3530 more cakes than any other baker.
Response:  We are given that there are 61 students in class A and 167 students in class B. If we take away 108 students from class B, how many will be left? So, the number of students left in class B after taking away 108 is 44. Therefore, the answer is (44).
Response:  We are given that there are 56 students in class A and 124 students in class B. If we take away 104 students from class B, then the remaining number of students in class B is 29. So, the answer is (29).
Response:  The difference between 52 and 84 is 32. If we subtract 32 from 102, we get 70. Therefore, the result of the given calculations is 70.
Response:  We are given that baker has 134 eggs and wants to make 11 omelets. Each omelet requires 2 eggs, so we need 11 x 2 = 22 eggs for one batch of omelets. Since there are 140 eggs left after making the first batch of omelets, we can make another batch of omelets using these remaining eggs. Therefore, the number of omelets baker can make is: 22 (from the initial 134 eggs) + 22 (from the remaining 140 eggs) = 44 omelets.
Response:  Vitafunwa is 153 and Keki is 97. To find out how many times Keki fits into Vitafunwa, we divide Keki by Vitafunwa which gives us 1.60 (Keki/Vitafunwa). Since rounding off to two decimal points gives us 1.6, therefore, Keki fits into Vitafunwa 16 times.
Response:  We are given that baker has 43 cookies and wants to share them equally among 114 people. So, each person will get x cookies where x = 43/114 = 0.367 (approximately). Now, if he gives away more than what he had, then the number of cookies he has left is equal to the difference between the total number of cookies he gave away and the original number of cookies he had. In this case, the total number of cookies given away is 154 - 43 = 111. Therefore, the number of cookies he has left is 111 - 43 = 68.
Response:  If Kelly is 22 years old and has been playing Super Mario Bros. for 140 hours, then she has played it for approximately 5.7 days (140/24).
Response:  If we take away 10 from 106, we get 96. So, the answer is 96.
Response:  If Kelly was playing Super Mario Bros. 91 and then switched to Super Mario Bros. 92, she would have played a total of 93 levels (91 + 92).
Response:  If Kelly has played 20 games on Nintendo and 70 games on Sony, then she has spent more time playing games on Sony than on Nintendo. So, if we subtract the number of games she has played on Nintendo from her total gaming time, we get: Time spent playing games on Sony = Total gaming time - Number of games played on Nintendo. In this case, that would be: Time spent playing games on Sony = 70 yrs - 20 games = 50 years. Therefore, Kelly spends approximately 50 years playing games on Sony.
Response:  The number of games released for Nintendo Switch is 46, and the number of games released for PlayStation 5 is 132. To find out how many more games were released for PlayStation 5 than for Nintendo Switch, we subtract the number of games released for Nintendo Switch from the number of games released for PlayStation 5: 132 - 46 = 86. So, there are 86 more games available for PlayStation 5 than for Nintendo Switch.
Response:  If we have to find out how many times more powerful is Nintendo 80 than Nintendo 31, we need to compare their computational powers. The computational power of Nintendo 80 is 4 MFLOPs (Million FLOating Point Operations Per Second), while that of Nintendo 31 is 256 KFLOPS (Kilo Floating Point Operations Per Second). Therefore, if we divide the computational power of Nintendo 80 by that of Nintendo 31, we get: 4 MFLOPs / 256 KFLOPS = 16 x 10^9. So, Nintendo 80 is approximately 16 billion times more powerful than Nintendo 31 in terms of computational power.
Response:  We are given that there were 52 people who attended the meeting and we need to find out how many of them had lunch. So, the number of people who did not have lunch is equal to the total number of attendees minus those who had lunch. Therefore, the number of people who did not have lunch is 52 - 38 = 14.
Response:  Vitengo 97 means that there are 97 villagers who have been affected by the disease. To find out how many will survive, we need to subtract the number of deaths (72) from the total number of villagers affected. Therefore, the number of surviving villagers is: 97 - 72 = 25.
Response:  We are given that Randy has 79 marbles and Ana has 14 marbles. If Randy gives 11 marbles to Ana, then how many marbles does Randy have left? So, the answer is 68 (79 - 11 = 68).
Response:  Vitalu has 58 years and his wife has 27 years. If they got married when vitalu was 30 years old, then vitalu is currently 88 years old (58 + 30). To find out how many children vitalu has, we need to subtract the age of vitalu at the time of marriage from the current age of vitalu. So, vitalu has been married for 53 years (current age - age at marriage).
Response:  We are given that Randy has 37 friends and Ana has 33 friends who will be staying at her house. Additionally, there are 13 people who will be sleeping in the living room. Now, we need to find out how many more people will be sleeping in Ana's house compared to Randy's. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total number of people sleeping in Ana's house = Number of friends + Number of people sleeping in living room = 33 + 13 = 46 People Therefore, the correct answer is (46) More people will be sleeping in Ana's house than in Randy's house.
Response:  We are given that Randy has 86 marbles and Ana has 79 marbles. When Randy gives some of his marbles to Ana, he has 82 marbles left. Now, we need to find out how many marbles Ana gets from Randy. To do this, we divide the number of marbles Randy has left (82) by the number of marbles Ana already has (79). So, Ana gets 82/79 = 10 more marbles from Randy. Therefore, the final number of marbles Ana has is 79 + 10 = 89 marbles.
Response:  If Randy had 36 vital organs and he lost 17 of them, then he has 19 remaining vital organs. Now, if he lost another 24 vital organs, he will have 0 remaining vital organs. So, the number of vital organs that Randy had after losing 24 is 0 - 19 = -15. Therefore, the correct answer is -15.
Response:  We have been given that Randy has 95 vital organs and Vitalu has 20 vital organs to donate. If we give 50 of these vital organs to Mnara, how many will be left for Vitalu? To find out, let's divide the number of vital organs Randy has (95) by the number of vital organs he can donate (50). This gives us 1.8 or 180%. So, more than half of Randy's vital organs will be used up in giving them to Mnara. Therefore, the answer is 180%.
Response:  We are given that Randy has 90 marbles and Ana has 89 marbles. To find out who has more marbles, we need to compare their respective collections. Since Ana has fewer marbles than Randy (Ana has 89 marbles while Randy has 90), we can say that Randy has more marbles than Ana. Now, let's consider the number of houses each person owns. According to the question, Randy owns one house with 63 rooms, while Ana owns two houses with a total of 126 rooms. Therefore, if we calculate the average number of rooms per house, we get: Average number of rooms per house = Total number of rooms / Number of houses Owned = 126 + 63 = 189 / 2 = 94.5 rooms per house So, based on this calculation, Ana has more rooms in her two houses than Randy has in his one house.

"Response:  We are given that there are 10 mistakes in the movie ""Crazy Silly School"". If we analyze the questions, we have 13 questions and if we assume each question has 2 mistakes (as per the pattern), then the total number of mistakes in the movie is:

13 x 2 = 26 mistakes
Therefore, the correct answer is 26."
"Response:  We are given that there are 11 mistakes in the first 10 pages of a book called ""Crazy Silly School"". If we assume that each mistake is equally distributed throughout the book (which may not be true), then the number of mistakes per page would be:

Number of mistakes / Number of pages = 11 / 10 = 1.1 mistakes/page

Now, if we want to find out how many mistakes are in the last 7 pages of the book, we can multiply the number of mistakes per page by the number of pages left:

Number of mistakes x Number of remaining pages = 1.1 mistakes/page x 7 pages = 7.7 mistakes

So, there are approximately 7.7 mistakes in the last 7 pages of the book."

Response:  If there are 7 people in total and each person has to pay $10 for the tickets, then the total amount of money needed is $70 (7 x $10). Now, if 2 of these people cannot attend the event, then the remaining 5 people will have to pay $140 ($70 / 5) for their tickets. So, the final answer is $140.
Response:  If there are 12 players in total and each player has 5 chances to score, then the total number of opportunities for scoring is 12 x 5 = 60. Since Dave scored 14 goals, he had more than his fair share of opportunities (60 - 14 = 46). So, Dave got 46 chances to score.
Response:  If there are 18 rounds in total and each round has 5 questions, then the number of questions is 18 x 5 = 90. Since there are 11 more questions than the number of rounds, we have 90 - 11 = 79 questions that Dave must answer correctly to win the game.
"Response:  If there are 19 people in an arcade and each person has 12 chances to win prizes worth 7 times more than what they spent, then the total number of chances available is:

19 x 12 = 218
So, if someone spends $50, their expected winnings would be:

$50 x 7 = $350"
Response:  If there are 13 people in an arcade and each person has to play at least 8 games, then the total number of games that need to be played is 13 x 8 = 104 games. Since there are only 18 game machines available, we can conclude that not everyone will get to play all the games they want. Therefore, the number of games that each person will get to play is (104 games / 18 game machines) = 5.77 games per person. So, the answer is approximately 6 games per person.
Response:  If there are 14 people in total and each person has to pay for two tickets, then the total number of tickets required is 14 x 2 = 28. Since Dave only had Sh 500, he could not afford to buy all the 28 tickets, so he bought as many as his money could afford, which is 10 tickets (Sh 500 / Sh 50 = 10). Therefore, Dave had Sh 400 left after buying the 10 tickets.
Response:  We have 14 trees in total and we remove 3 of them. After removing, there are 9 trees left. Now let's calculate how many more trees were removed from the original number. So, (14 - 3) = 11 trees were removed from the original number. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  We are given that there were 13 trees in the forest and after cutting down 6 of them, there were 9 remaining trees. So, the number of trees left after cutting down 6 is 9 - 6 = 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  We have 20 trees in total and we want to know how many are left after cutting down 4 of them. So, if we cut down 4 trees, then we will have 20 - 4 = 16 trees left. Therefore, there are 16 trees left after cutting down 4 trees from the initial 20.
Response:  If there are 12 birds in the tree and each bird lays 5 eggs, then the total number of eggs is 12 x 5 = 60 eggs. Therefore, if some of these eggs hatched, we would have more than 60 eggs. So, the correct answer is (more than 60).
Response:  According to the question, there are 9 trees in the forest and after cutting down 4 of them, there will be 5 more left. So, the final number of trees in the forest is 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If there were 12 clouds in the sky at first, and then 5 more clouds appeared, how many clouds would be in total now? So, the answer is 17 (12 + 5).
Response:  If there were three holes in the ground initially and one more hole was dug, then the total number of holes would be 4 (initial + new). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If there were 11 holes dug initially and then 5 more holes were added later, how many holes would be in total after adding the additional 5 holes? Therefore, the answer is 16 (11 + 5).
Response:  We are given that there are 66 students in total and we want to know how many will pass with at least 28 points. So, let X be the number of students who will pass with at least 28 points. From the question, we know that the total number of students is 66. Therefore, the probability of any one student passing with at least 28 points is 1/3. Now, we need to find out how many times this event occurs when we repeat it 66 times (i.e., for each of the 66 students). This can be calculated as follows: P(at least 28) = 1/3 × 1/3 ×... × 1/3 = 1/27. Since there are 66 students, the expected value of the number of students passing with at least 28 points is 66 × 1/27 = 25.92. So, approximately 26 students will pass with at least 28 points.
Response:  If Kisha takes 8 days to complete one round of machungwa, then she will take 24 days to complete 3 rounds (mifuko) of machungwa. Therefore, the answer is 24.
Response:  We are given that Kisha has collected $100 every week for 4 weeks and she wants to know how much money she has collected in total. To find out, we need to multiply the amount of money collected per week by the number of weeks she collected it. So, if she collected $100 per week for 4 weeks, then she has collected a total of $100 x 4 = $400. Now, let's assume that after collecting this amount, she spent $20 on something. So, her remaining balance is $400 - $20 = $380. Therefore, the answer is $380.
Response:  We are given that there are 38 children in total and each child takes 4 days to complete their work. Therefore, the total number of days taken by all the children to complete their work is:  38 x 4 = 152 days. However, after 49 days, only 42 children have completed their work, which means that 10 children (38 - 42) have not yet completed their work. So, the answer is 10 days.
Response:  We are given that there are 66 students in total and each student takes 25 days to complete their coursework. Therefore, we can calculate the number of days taken by all students to complete their coursework as follows: Number of days = Total number of students x Time taken per student  Number of days = 66 x 25 = 1600 days Now, we are asked how many days will pass after 87 days have passed since the beginning of the coursework. To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of days that have already passed (87) from the total number of days taken by all students to complete their coursework (1600). Therefore, the answer is: Number of days left = Total number of days - Days passed  Number of days left = 1600 - 87 = 1513 days
Response:  We are given that there are 8 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 8 with 24, we get 192 hours in a week. Now, we are asked how many hours Kisha spends on her hobbies per day. Since she spends 35 hours per day on her hobbies, we can divide 35 by 24 to find out how many hours she spends on her hobbies per day. Therefore, Kisha spends 1.46 hours (35/24) on her hobbies per day.
Response:  We are given that there are 16 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. Therefore, we have 16 x 24 = 384 hours in a week. Now, we need to find out how many hours Kisha spends on her hobbies per day. According to the question, she spends 57 hours on her hobbies every day. So, we can calculate the total number of hours she spends on her hobbies in one week as follows: Total hours spent on hobbies = Number of days x Hours spent per day = 384 hours/day x 57 hours/day = 21,968 hours/week.
Response:  We are given that there are 67 students in total and they will be divided into groups of 12 each. So, we have to find out how many groups can be formed from these 67 students. To do this, we divide the total number of students (67) by the number of students in each group (12). This gives us 5 groups (67/12 = 5). Now, we need to know how many students will be left after forming these 5 groups. To find this, we subtract the number of students used for each group from the total number of students (67 - 5 x 12 = 67 - 60 = 7). Therefore, there will be 7 students left over after forming the 5 groups.
"Response:  We are given that there were 74 people who went for a trip and returned after 71 days. To find out how many people did not return, we need to subtract the number of people who returned from the total number of people who went for the trip. So, the number of people who did not return is:

Number of people who did not return = Total number of people - Number of people who returned
= 74 - 71
= 3
Therefore, 3 people did not return after the 71-day trip."
"Response:  We are given that there are 76 students in total and they will be divided into groups of 64. To find out how many groups can be formed, we need to divide the total number of students by 64. So, the number of groups that can be formed is:

76 / 64 = 1.2
Therefore, approximately 1.2 groups can be formed with 64 students each."
Response:  We are given that there are 28 students in class A and 52 students in class B. The difference between their ages is 24 years (52 - 28 = 24). Therefore, the age of the student who was in class A 26 years ago will be 26 + 24 = 50 years old now.
"Response:  We are given that there were 82 students who passed their exams and 61 of them got scholarships. To find out how many did not get scholarships, we subtract the number of those who got scholarships from the total number of students who passed their exams. So, the number of students who did not get scholarships is:
82 - 61 = 21
Therefore, 21 students did not get scholarships after passing their exams."
"Response:  We are given that there are 31 chickens in total and they lay eggs at a rate of 24 eggs per day. Therefore, in 45 days, the number of eggs laid will be:

Number of eggs = Total number of chickens x Number of eggs produced per day
= 31 x 24
= 724 eggs
So after 45 days, there will be 724 eggs."
Response:  We are given that there are 44 students who passed their exams and 25 of them got scholarships. To find out how many more students got scholarships than those who passed their exams, we need to subtract the number of scholars from the total number of passers. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  44 - 25 = 19. Therefore, 19 more students got scholarships than those who passed their exams.
Response:  We are given that there are 5 birds perched on a tree branch and 74 birds perched on other branches. To find out which group has more birds, we need to count the total number of birds in both groups. So, let's do that: Total number of birds = Number of birds perched on one branch + Number of birds perched on another branch In this case, the total number of birds is: Total number of birds = 5 + 74 = 89 birds Now, since there are more than 89 birds (89 < 100), it means that the second group (the ones perched on other branches) has more birds than the first group (the ones perched on the same branch). Therefore, the answer is (D) More than 100 birds.
Response:  We are given that Kisha is currently 54 years old and will be 60 years old after 6 years. So, at this point, Kisha will be 60 - 6 = 54 years old. Now, we need to find out how many years it took for Kisha to grow from being 18 years old to being 54 years old. To do this, we can subtract the age of Kisha when she was 18 from her current age: 54 - 18 = 36 years. Therefore, it took Kisha 36 years to grow from being 18 years old to being 54 years old.
Response:  We are given that there were 56 birds in total and we want to find out how many birds flew away per day. So, let's divide the total number of birds by the number of days (14). Therefore, the answer is:  56 / 14 = 3.85714285714286.
Response:  We are given that there were 25 babies born in one month and 5 of them died within the first week. So, at most, only 20 babies would have survived beyond the first week. Now we are asked how many babies would have survived beyond 73 days (or 3 months). To find this out, we need to subtract the number of deaths (5) from the total number of births (25), which gives us 20. Therefore, the answer is 20 babies would have survived beyond 73 days.
Response:  We are given that there are 65 students in class A and 46 students in class B. The question asks for the number of days between the two classes. To find this, we need to subtract the number of days since class A started from the day when class B started. So, if class A started on Monday (day 1), then class B started on Tuesday (day 2). Therefore, the difference between the two classes is: 6 - 2 = 4 days.
Response:  We are given that there are 41 students who have passed their exams and want to join Form One. Out of these, 25 students will be selected from each school. Therefore, the total number of students who will join Form One is: 41 x 25 = 1025. So, the answer is 1025.
Response:  We are given that there are 71 students who have passed their exams and 60 students who failed their exams. To find out which group has more members, we need to add both groups together and divide by two. So, let's do that: (71 + 60) / 2 = 131 / 2 = 65.5. Therefore, there are more than 65 students who passed their exams.
Response:  The number of books in Jesse's library is 12 and there are 11 books on the shelf. To find out how many more books there are than those on the shelf, we subtract the number of books on the shelf from the total number of books: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, there are one more book in Jesse's library than the ones on the shelf.
"Response:  The height of Jesse is 180 cm and he wants to know how many times his height will fit in a basket with a diameter of 14 cm. So, we need to divide Jesse's height by the diameter of the basket.

$$ \frac{180}{14} =? $$

The result is $12.14$ which means that Jesse's height can be divided into $12$ parts using the basket's diameter."
Response:  The height of Jesse is given as 180 cm and he has been sitting for 2 hours. Therefore, the distance traveled by his buttocks is: Distance = Speed x Time = 30 cm/min x 2 hrs = 60 cm. So, the position of his buttocks after 2 hours is: Up = 60 cm - 180 cm = -120 cm.
Response:  If we have 11 players in a football team and each player has two jerseys (one for training and one for playing), then we have a total of 22 jerseys (11 x 2 = 22). Now, if we subtract the number of jerseys that are damaged or lost (16), we will be left with 6 jerseys (22 - 16 = 6) that can be used for the remaining 9 players (11 - 16 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We are given that there are 12 students in total and they are divided into groups of 4 each. So, we have 3 groups. Now, we need to find out how many students will be left after forming these groups. To do this, we can subtract the number of groups from the total number of students. Therefore, the answer is: 12 - 3 = 9.
Response:  If there are 19 students in class 1A and 18 students in class 1B, then the total number of students in both classes is 19 + 18 = 37. Since there are 20 students in the whole school, we can deduce that 37/20 = x, where x is the number of students in class 1A. Therefore, the answer is 37/20 = 1.85.
Response:  The number of students in class A is 19 and those in class B are 20. To find out which group has more students, we need to subtract the number of students in class B from the number of students in class A. So, the difference between the two groups is:  19 - 20 = -1. Therefore, there are one fewer student in class B than in class A.
"Response:  If there are 10 people in a room and each person has brought 2 bags of maize flour (futi), then the total number of bags of maize flour is 10 x 2 = 20 bags. Since each bag weighs 9 kg, the total weight of all the bags of maize flour is 20 x 9 = 180 kg. Therefore, if chumba chake means ""a small bag"" or ""a handful"", then the amount of maize flour that one person can carry is 1/10th of 180 kg, which is approximately 18 kg. So, if chumba chake means ""a small bag"" or ""a handful"", then the amount of maize flour that one person can carry is approximately 18 kg."
Response:  If there are 10 people in a room and each person has eaten 2 portions of food, then the total number of portions of food eaten is 10 x 2 = 20. So, the answer to the question is 20.
Response:  We are given that Jesse has 18 marbles and he wants to share them equally among his friends who are 5 in number. Each friend will get how many marbles? So, we divide 18 by 5 which gives us 3.6. Since we can't give a fraction of a marble, each friend will get 3 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  The number of Fulanas is given as 100. Each Fulana has 23 children. So, the total number of children for all Fulanas is 100 x 23 = 2300. Therefore, the answer is 2300.
"Response:  The number of Fulanas in the scenario is given as 51. Since each Fulana has two legs, we have 2 x 51 = 102 feet. Now, since Lilipata is described as ""dola"" which means ""fast"", let's assume that it moves at a speed of 5 miles per hour (mph). Therefore, the distance traveled by Lilipata in 3 hours would be 5 x 3 = 15 miles. So, the total distance traveled by all the Fulanas and Lilipata together is 102 + 15 = 117 miles."
"Response:  We are given that there were 95 points scored during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. If we assume that each team had 47 players (fulanas), then we can calculate the average number of points scored per player as follows:
Average points scored per player = Total points scored / Number of players
= 95 / 47
= 2
So, on average, each player scored 2 points during the game."
Response:  The number of Fulanas playing for Arkansas is 115 and the number of Fulanas playing for Texas Tech is 242. To find out how many Fulanas will be left to play against each other, we need to subtract the number of Fulanas playing for Texas Tech from the total number of Fulanas playing for both teams: 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, there will be 127 Fulanas left to play against each other between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  We are given that there were 163 points scored by Fulana during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. If we assume that each point was worth $1, then Fulana earned $163 during the game. However, if we subtract the amount of money she spent (89), then we get the remaining amount of money Fulana earned, which is $74 ($163 - $89).
Response:  We are given that there were 186 points scored by Fulanas during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. Also, we know that each Fulana scored an average of 172 points per game. Therefore, if we want to find out how many Fulanas played during the game, we can use the following equation: Number of Fulanas = Total points / Average points per Fulana. Substituting the values we have been given into this equation, we get: Number of Fulanas = 186/172 = 10.5. So, approximately 11 Fulanas played during the game.
Response:  The number of points scored by Arkansas is 183 and the number of points scored by Texas Tech is 31. Therefore, if we subtract the score of Texas Tech from that of Arkansas, we get 152 (183 - 31). So, the difference in scores between Arkansas and Texas Tech is 152 points.
Response:  The difference between the number of points scored by Arkansas and Texas Tech is 90 (74 - 156). So, if we divide this difference by 2, we get 45 as the number of points that Arkansas would have scored had they made every shot they took.
"Response:  The number of Fulanas is given as 192 and the number of Jezis is given as 34. We are asked to find out how many more Fulanas there are than Jezis. So we can start by subtracting the number of Jezis from the total number of Fulanas:  
192 - 34 = 158 Therefore, there are 158 more Fulanas than Jezis."
Response:  The difference between the number of points scored by Fulana and the number of points scored by the opposing team is given as 254 - 43 = 211. Therefore, the number of points scored by Fulana is 211 more than the number of points scored by the opposing team.
Response:  We are given that there are 51 women in total and each woman has 130 children. So, we have to calculate the total number of children. To do this, we can use multiplication. The total number of children is equal to 51 x 130 = 6,530.
Response:  We are given that there are 500 women in Arkansas and 300 men in Arkansas. Also, we know that each woman has 2 children, and each man has 3 children. Therefore, the total number of people (women + men) in Arkansas is:  500 + 300 = 800. Now, let's move to Texas where there are 1000 women and 600 men. Each woman has 2 children, and each man has 3 children. So, the total number of people (women + men) in Texas is: 1000 + 600 = 1600. Finally, we need to calculate how many babies were born in both states combined. To do this, we will use the information that each woman gives birth to 2 children every year. Therefore, the total number of babies born in both states combined per year is: 800 x 2 = 1600 + 1000 x 2 = 2000. So, the total number of babies born in both states combined since 2010 is: 2000 x 9 = 18,000.
Response:  If there are 50 women in total and each woman has to pay $10 for the game, then the total amount of money collected will be: 50 x $10 = $500. So, the answer is $500.
Response:  The cost of one ticket for the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech is $215. If there are five tickets in total, then the total cost would be $215 x 5 = $1075. So, if each fan buys two tickets, they will spend $1075 / 2 = $537.50 per person.
Response:  The number of razorback fans in Arkansas is given as 5 and the total number of fans for both teams combined is 215. Since the ratio of razorback fans to red raider fans is 5:64, we can set up the following equation: 5/215 = x/64 where x is the number of red raider fans. Now we are asked to find out how much money each fan spent on tickets. So, we need to multiply the number of fans by the amount they spent per ticket. Using the information provided earlier that the average cost per ticket was $100, we get: $100x = $5000. Solving for x, we get $x = 50. Therefore, each red raider fan spent an average of $100.
Response:  The number of ducks in Arkansas is 76 and the number of jelly beans in Texas Tech is 158. So, if we want to know how many jelly beans there are for every duck in Arkansas, we can divide the number of jelly beans by the number of ducks. Therefore, the answer is 2 (jelly beans per duck).
Response:  The difference between the number of points scored by Fulana and the number of points scored by Razorback is 63 (23 - 177). So, if we divide this difference by two, we get 31.5 as the number of points that Fulana would score more than Razorback. Therefore, the answer is 31.5.
Response:  We are given that Duka has scored 115 points and Fulana has scored 113 points. To find out who scored more points than Fulana, we need to subtract Fulana's score from Duka's score. So, Duka scored more points than Fulana by 115 - 113 = 2 points. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 points.
Response:  We have 5 plates of food and each plate has 10 pieces of food. Therefore, we have a total of 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of food. So, the correct answer is 50.
Response:  We have 10 rooms in total and each room has 3 beds, so we have 30 beds in total. Now let's assume that there are 12 people sleeping in each bed, so we have a total of 360 people sleeping in the house (30 beds x 12 people per bed).
Response:  We are given that there are 3 windows in the house and each window has 9 panes. Therefore, the total number of panes in the house is 3 x 9 = 27. So, the correct answer is 27.
Response:  If there are 11 plates of food and each plate has 13 pieces, then the total number of pieces of food is: 11 x 13 = 143. Therefore, the correct answer is 143.
Response:  We have 10 plates of food and each plate has 6 pieces. Therefore, we have a total of 10 x 6 = 60 pieces of food. Since there are 11 people eating, each person will get 60/11 = 5.45 pieces of food per person. So, the answer is 5 or 6 pieces of food per person.
"Response:  The number of people who can fit in a room with dimensions 12 meters long and 6 meters wide is calculated as follows:

Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the room. The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length is 12 meters and the width is 6 meters, so the area of the room is:
Area = 12 x 6 = 72 square meters

Now, let's divide the total area of the room (72 square meters) by the size of each person (0.5 square meters). This will give us an estimate of how many people can fit in the room:
Number of people = Total area / Size per person = 72 / 0.5 = 144 people
Therefore, there are approximately 144 people who can fit in the room."
Response:  The number of people who can fit in a room is 4 per mattress and there are 3 mattres in total. Therefore, the maximum number of people that can fit in the room is 4 x 3 = 12. Since there are 14 people standing outside the room, more than the maximum capacity of the room.
Response:  The number of people in the house is 14 and each plate has 9 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food is:  14 x 9 = 126. So, there are more than 100 pieces of food.
Response:  If Lewis has $460 and he spends $5 per week on vegetables, then his remaining balance after one week is: $460 - $5 = $455. After two weeks, his balance will be: $455 - $10 = $445. And so on...
"Response:  If Lewis has $1216 during his vacation and he spends $16 every week, then we can calculate how many weeks he spent on vacation as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
Therefore, Lewis spent 78 weeks on vacation."
"Response:  If Lewis has $ 21, and he wants to know how much money he will have after buying 216 bags of rice worth $ 702, we need to calculate as follows:
$ 21 x 216 = $ 4592
So, Lewis will have $ 4592 after buying 216 bags of rice worth $ 702."
Response:  The amount of money that Kamal Lewis has in his account is $1357 and he wants to know how much he will have after 73 days if he earns interest of $223 per month. To calculate this, we need to use the formula for compound interest: A = P x (1 + r)^n where: A = final balance P = principal amount ( initial amount in Lewis's case) r = monthly interest rate (in this case, it's $223/month) n = number of months (in this case, it's 73 months) So plugging in the values, we get: A = $1357 x (1 + $223/12)^(73/12) = approximately $2064.89 Therefore, after 73 days, Kamal Lewis will have approximately $2064.89 in his account assuming an interest rate of $223 per month.
Response:  The number of weeks in a year is 52. So if Lewis worked for 1091 days, he worked for approximately 21 years (1091/52=21). If he worked for 21 years, he earned approximately $939 per week ($28,000/21= $939).
Response:  If Lewis has $ 403 and he gives away $ 49 to each of the 5 wikis, then he will have $ 403 - $ 49 x 5 = $ 354 left after giving away money to all the wikis.
Response:  If Lewis has $368 and he spends $388 in one day, then he will have $368 - $388 = -$20 left after that day. So, his balance is negative $20.
"Response:  We are given that Lewis has $491 and he wants to buy 1181 bags of rice worth $216 each. So, we need to calculate how many bags of rice Lewis can buy with his money. To do this, we divide the amount of money Lewis has ($491) by the cost of one bag of rice ($216):
$491 / $216 = 2.25 bags of rice
Therefore, Lewis can buy 2.25 bags of rice with his $491."
Response:  The number of pages in Wikipedia is approximately 50 million (50,000,000). If we divide this number by 133, we get approximately 400,000. Therefore, the answer to the question is 400,000.
Response:  If Lewis has $2 and he spends $178, then he will have $0 left after spending that amount. So, the answer is $0.
Response:  If there are 10 students in total and we want to know how many will pass with at least 9 points, we can start by finding out how many students scored less than 9 points. So, if the highest score is 10, then the number of students who scored less than 9 points is 10 - 1 = 9. Therefore, the number of students who passed with at least 9 points is 9.
Response:  We are given that there are 8 students in class C and each student takes 2 cups of water. Therefore, the total number of cups taken by all the students in Class C is 8 x 2 = 16 cups. Now we are told that Dean has 14 cups of water. So, the remaining amount of water after Dean took his share is 16 - 14 = 2 cups.
Response:  We are given that there are 5 water taps in Ron's house and each tap can supply 10 liters of water per minute. Therefore, the total amount of water supplied by all the taps together is 5 x 10 = 50 liters per minute. Since Ron has 11 friends who want to take showers, they will need a total of 11 x 10 = 110 liters of water in 6 minutes. So, after 6 minutes, the tank will be empty.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 students in total and Dean has 4 more than Ron. So, if Ron has 13 students, then Dean has 13 + 4 = 17 students. Therefore, the number of water bottles needed is 17.
Response:  We are given that there are 16 water taps in total and Ron has 9 of them. So, we have to find out how many water taps Ron does not have. To do this, we subtract the number of water taps Ron has from the total number of water taps. Therefore, the number of water taps Ron does not have is equal to the total number of water taps minus the number of water taps Ron has, which is 16 - 9 = 7.
Response:  We are given that there are 9 students in total and Dean has 6 of them. So, if we subtract the number of students that Dean has from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students - Number of students with Dean = 9 - 6 = 3. Therefore, the remaining three students do not belong to Dean.

Response:  The number of friends that Carol has is given as 15. Since each friend can invite 3 guests, the total number of people invited will be 15 x 3 = 45. However, since some friends may not have any guests or may have more than three guests, we need to subtract the number of guests who did not bring anyone from the total number of people invited. Therefore, the correct answer is 45 - 7 = 38.
Response:  The total number of friends that Carol has is 14. Each friend can invite 6 people to her party, so the total number of guests at the party will be 14 x 6 = 84. Since there are 11 more guests than friends, the remaining guests will be 84 - 11 = 73. Therefore, the correct answer is 73.
Response:  We are given that Carol has 10 friends and each friend can bring 3 more friends. So in total, Carol will have 10 x 3 = 30 friends. Now we are asked how many friends Carol will have if she invites her friends to bring their friends too. Since each of Carol's friends can bring 3 more friends, the total number of friends Carol will have after this round is 30 x 3 = 90 friends. Therefore, the correct answer is (90).
Response:  If there are 12 games in total and each game has 36 points, then the total number of points is: 12 x 36 = 432.

Response:  We are given that Melissa scored 109 points in total and she scored 82 points in each of the first 5 games. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Score in game 1 + Score in game 2 +... + Score in game 5. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total score = 109 + 82 + 82 + 82 + 82 = 462. Now, we are asked how many points Melissa scored in game 7. Since she scored 82 points in each of the first 5 games, it means she scored 82 x 7 = 566 points in all the 7 games combined. So, the answer is 566 - 462 = 104 points.
"Response:  If there are 21 players in each team and each team plays 7 matches, then the total number of matches played will be;  21 x 7 = 147 matches."

Response:  If there are 20 people who can carry one person each and they want to climb paradise hill for 4 days, then on the first day, 5 people will be able to climb (since 1/4 of 20 is 5). On the second day, 4 people will be able to climb (since 1/4 of 20 is 4), and so on until all 20 people have climbed paradise hill. Therefore, the total number of people who will be able to climb paradise hill in 4 days is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16 people.
Response:  If there are 9 people in paradise and each person can bring one guest, then the total number of people in paradise will be 9 + 9 = 18. So, the answer is 18.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 15 people who can fit inside the paradise at one time. The paradise has a capacity of 20 people. Therefore, the number of times that all 15 people can enter the paradise is:
(15 x 1) / (20 - 15) = 3
So, the answer is 3."
Response:  If there are 10 people in paradise and each person can bring one guest, then the total number of people in paradise will be 10 + (10 x 1) = 20. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  If there are 16 people in total and each person can carry 2 bags of rice, then the total number of bags that can be carried is 16 x 2 = 32 bags. So, if 14 people go to paradise at once, they will be able to carry 32 / 14 = 2.357 bags of rice per person.
Response:  The number of people who can fit in paradise is 23 x 10 = 230. Now, let's calculate how many people can fit in each compartment. For compartment 1, we have 14 people, and for compartment 2, we have 54 people. So, the total number of people who can fit in both compartments is 14 + 54 = 68 people. Therefore, there are 68 people who can fit in paradise based on the given information.
"Response:  The number of people who can fit in each compartment is as follows: Compartment 1 has space for 4 people, Compartment 2 has space for 5 people, and Compartment 3 has space for 7 people. There are a total of 16 people who want to board the train. Now, let's calculate how many people will be able to board each compartment: Compartment 1 can accommodate 4/16 = 0.25 or 2 people; Compartment 2 can accommodate 5/16 = 0.31 or 3 people; and Compartment 3 can accommodate 7/16 = 0.44 or 4 people. Therefore, out of the 16 people who want to board the train, only 2 people will be able to board Compartment 1, 3 people will be able to board Compartment 2, and 4 people will be able to board Compartment 3."
Response:  If there are 16 people in Paradise and each person can bring 4 friends with them, then the total number of people who will enter Paradise is:  16 x 4 = 64.
Response:  If there are 10 people in paradise and each person can have up to 2 companions, then the total number of people in paradise will be 10 + (2 x 9) = 38.

Response:  If there are 17 pieces of pizza and each piece has 4 bites, then the total number of bites is 17 x 4 = 68. So, if there are 25 people eating the pizza, each person will get approximately 68/25 = 2.72 bites per person.
Response:  The number of people who have not eaten is 10 (kila mmoja ikiwa tunagawanya sawasawa). Now, let's consider how many people will eat if each person takes one plate of food. So, the total number of plates that will be taken = 2 x 10 = 20. Therefore, the number of people who will eat = 20/2 = 10.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 cows in total and each cow gives 4 liters of milk per day. Therefore, the total amount of milk produced daily is 10 x 4 = 40 liters. Now, we are asked how much milk will be left after 3 days if 20 liters of milk are consumed every day. So, the remaining milk after 3 days is 40 - 20 = 20 liters.
Response:  Mama yake has 45 grandchildren aged between 0 and 12 years old. If each of them contributes equally to the expenses of the trip, then the total amount contributed will be equal to the cost of the trip divided by the number of grandchildren. So, if the cost of the trip is Kshs 900, then the amount contributed by each grandchild will be Kshs 900 / 45 = Kshs 20 per grandchild. Therefore, Mama yake will receive Kshs 20 x 45 = Kshs 900 from her grandchildren towards the expenses of the trip.
Response:  Mama yake has 36 grandchildren and she wants to give each of them equal share of her property worth Kshs 58 million. Since there are 12 children in total, each child will get an equal share of Kshs 470,000 (Kshs 58 million divided by 12). Therefore, the answer is Kshs 470,000.
Response:  Mama yake has 5 children, and each child has 3 siblings. Therefore, the total number of people in the family is 5 x 3 = 15. Since mama yake is 60 years old, she will have 15 grandchildren when they are all born. If each grandchild lives for an average of 70 years, then the total number of generations that will be alive at any given time is 15 x 70 = 1050 years. So, mama yake will live to see her great-grandchildren.
Response:  If Mama Yake has 10 cows and each cow gives her 5 liters of milk per day, then in total she gets 50 liters of milk per day (10 cows x 5 liters/cow/day). Now if she sells each liter of milk at Ksh 20, then she earns Ksh 1000 per day from milk sales alone (50 liters/day x Ksh 20/liter). However, this does not include any other income sources like farming or other businesses that she may have. So the correct answer is Ksh 1000 per day.
Response:  If there are 8 villages in Maua and each village has 32 households, then the total number of households in all 8 villages is 8 x 32 = 256. Since we want to know how many houses will be affected if one house is destroyed in each village, we need to divide the total number of households by 8. So, the answer is 256 / 8 = 32. Therefore, 32 houses will be affected if one house is destroyed in each of the 8 villages in Maua.

Response:  If Matthew had 8 friends and he gave each of them 2 gifts, then how many gifts did Matthew give in total? That is, 8 x 2 = 16 gifts.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 friends and each friend gave him $10 as a gift, then Matthew would receive a total of $15 x 15 = $225 in gifts. However, if 5 of his friends gave him $10 each and the remaining 10 friends gave him $20 each, then Matthew would receive a total of $5 x $10 + $10 x $20 = $70 + $200 = $270 in gifts. Therefore, the correct answer is $270.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 friends and each friend received 3 gifts, then the total number of gifts given out is 24 x 3 = 72. However, if 17 of these friends were fake friends who did not receive any gifts, then the actual number of gifts given to genuine friends would be 72 - 17 = 55. Therefore, the correct answer is 55.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 biscuits and shared them equally among his 11 friends, each friend would get 2 biscuits. So, the answer is 2 x 11 = 22.

Response:  If Matthew had 14 biscuits and shared them equally among his 7 friends, each friend would get 2 biscuits. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If there are 18 friends and each friend has brought one bottle of soda, then the total number of bottles of soda is 18 x 1 = 18. Now, if there were 36 people in total, including the 18 friends who brought soda, then the total number of bottles of soda would be 18 + (36 - 18) = 18 + 18 = 36. Therefore, the answer is 36.
Response:  If Mathew had 36 biscuits and he wanted to share them equally among his 5 friends, each friend would get 7 biscuits (36/5=7).
Response:  If there are 23 people in total and each person has 11 friends, then the number of friendships is: 23 x 11 = 253. So, there are 253 friendships among the group of 23 people.
Response:  If Matthew had 31 friends and gave each of them 23 gifts, he would have given away a total of 703 (31 x 23). However, if he gave some of these gifts to his close friends who numbered 5, then the remaining amount of gifts he gave away would be 698 (703 - 5). So, the correct answer is 698.
Response:  If there are 4 people and each person has 32 biscuits (biskuti) and 98 sweets (keki), then the total number of biscuits shared among all four friends is:  32 x 4 = 128 biscuits. Similarly, the total number of sweets shared among all four friends is: 98 x 4 = 392 sweets. Therefore, the answer to the question is 128 for biscuits and 392 for sweets.
Response:  If there are 10 biscuits and each person gets 2 biscuits, then each person will get 5 biscuits in total (10 / 2 = 5). Since there are 8 people, they will get a total of 40 biscuits (5 x 8 = 40).
Response:  We are given that there were 28 people in total and they had 13 baskets of food with them. Each basket contained 15 pieces of food. To find out how many pieces of food each person had, we can divide the number of baskets by the number of people: 13/28 = 0.467 or approximately 1/2. So, each person had about half a piece of food on average.
"Response:  We are given that there were 109 cups of tea consumed in total and we want to find out how many cups were consumed per day on average. So, let's divide the total number of cups by the number of days (74). Therefore, the average number of cups consumed per day is:  
Average = Total cups / Number of days = 109 / 74 = 1.46 cups per day."
Response:  The number of days between Debby and Punguzo is 153 days. If we divide this number by 7 (the number of days in a week), we get 21.67 days per week. So, if Chupa takes place every 7 days, then it will take him 21.67 days to complete his work. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  If Debby takes 15 steps every 11 seconds, then she will cover a distance of... (calculate)
Response:  We are given that there were 301 people in the village at first and they consumed 144 bags of maize per week. Since each bag contains 20 kg of maize, we can calculate the total amount of maize consumed per week as follows: Total amount of maize = Number of people x Amount of maize per person per week Total amount of maize = 301 x 144 = 43,640 kg per week Now, let's find out how many weeks it took for them to consume all the maize. We know that the total amount of maize was 43,640 kg, and since they consumed it all within 144 weeks, we can calculate the time taken as follows: Time taken = Total amount of maize / Amount of maize consumed per week Time taken = 43,640 kg / 144 kg/week = 300 weeks Therefore, it took them 300 weeks or approximately 6.9 years to consume all the maize.
Response:  If Debby has 88 bags of rice and she gives away 13 bags to someone, then she will have 75 bags left (88 - 13 = 75). Now, if she also has 87 bags of sugar and she gives away 4 bags to someone, then she will be left with 83 bags of sugar (87 - 4 = 83). So, in total, Debby will have 75 bags of rice and 83 bags of sugar after giving some away.
Response:  If we have 312 cups of water and 4 cups of soda, then the ratio of water to soda is 312:4 = 78:1. So if we want to know how many cups of soda there are in 312 cups of water, we can multiply the number of cups of water by the ratio of water to soda, which gives us 78 cups of soda. Therefore, the answer is 78 cups of soda.
Response:  If Debby takes 6 days to complete 12 liters of water, then she will take x number of days to complete y liters of water where x = 6 and y = 12. Therefore, if Debby is given 30 liters of water to carry in one day, it will take her x = 6 days to complete this task since 30 / 6 = 5 liters per day. So, the answer is 5 days.
Response:  Chupa 95 for soda and chupa 180 for maji means that there are 95/180 = 0.5375 cups of soda required to make 1 cup of maji. Now, if we have 15 cups of soda and want to make 54 cups of maji, we will need 54/0.5375 = 102.67 cups of soda. So, the number of cups of soda needed is 102.67.
Response:  We are given that Debby has 360 bottles of soda and she wants to share them equally among her friends who have different numbers of bottles. For example, Sarah has 122 bottles, John has 9 bottles, and Tom has 48 bottles. To find out how many bottles each friend will get from Debby, we need to divide their respective number of bottles by the total number of bottles Debby has (360). So, Sarah will get 122/360 = 35 bottles, John will get 9/360 = 2 bottles, and Tom will get 48/360 = 13 bottles. Now, let's calculate how many bottles of soda Debby will have left after sharing with her friends. The total number of bottles Debby had initially was 360 - the number of bottles she gave to Sarah (35) + the number of bottles she gave to John (2) + the number of bottles she gave to Tom (13) = 360 - 35 - 2 - 13 = 318 bottles. Therefore, Debby will have 318 bottles of soda left after sharing with her friends.
Response:  If there are 14 players in one team and each player has 2 pens, then the total number of pens for that team is 14 x 2 = 28 pens. Now, if another team has 11 players and each player has 3 pens, then the total number of pens for that team is 11 x 3 = 33 pens. So, the difference between the two teams is 28 - 33 = -5 pens. Therefore, the answer is -5 pens.
Response:  If there are 12 pens in total and we want to know how many pens each student will get if they share equally among themselves, then each student will get 12/x pens where x is the number of students sharing. So, if there are 5 students sharing, each student will get 12/5 = 2.4 pens.
"Response:  We are given that there were 16 pens in total and we want to know how many pens were left after 28 pens were taken from them. So, if 28 pens were taken, then the number of pens left is:
Number of pens left = Total number of pens - Number of pens taken
= 16 x 0.75 (since 28/16 = 0.75)
= 12
Therefore, the correct answer is 12."
Response:  We are given that there were 22 farmers who harvested 6 baskets of maize each. So, in total, they harvested 22 x 6 = 132 baskets of maize.
Response:  We are given that there were 50 safu (bags) and each bag contained 7 pens. So, in total, we have 50 x 7 = 350 pens. Therefore, the correct answer is 350 pens.
Response:  We are given that Faye scored 39 points in Safu 19 and 4 points in Safu 27. To find out how many penseli she got, we need to add these two scores together. So, the total number of penseli Faye got is:  39 + 4 = 43. Therefore, the answer is 43.
"Response:  We are given that Faye has 12 pens and 36 pens in total. From this information, we can calculate the average number of pens per rank as follows:
Average number of pens per rank = (Total number of pens / Number of ranks)
= (12 + 36) / 2
= 48 / 2
= 24
So, Faye has 24 pens per rank."
Response:  We are given that Faye has 50 pens and 11 pencils of different colors. From this information, we can determine how many pensels she has in total as follows: Pens x Color = Total number of pens. Therefore, if Faye has 50 pens and 11 pencils, then her total number of pens is 50 x 11 = 550 pens. Now let's consider the second part of the question whereby Faye has 31 pens and 27 pencils of different colors. To calculate the total number of pensel she has from these two parts of the question, we multiply the number of pens by their respective color values: Pen x Color = Total number of pens. So for the first part (Faye has 31 pens), the total number of pens is 31 x 11 = 341 pens. For the second part (Faye has 27 pencils), the total number of pens is 27 x 3 = 81 pens. Finally, to find the grand total number of pensels, we add up all the individual totals obtained above: Grand Total Number of Pensels = 550 + 341 + 81 = 972 pensels.
Response:  If Faye has 30 pens and she gives away 5 pens to each of her friends, then how many pens will she have left? So, Faye will have 30 - (5 x 4) = 30 - 20 = 10 pens left. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If there were 6 pens in total and we took away 3, then there would be 3 pens left. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We are given that Faye had 35 pens and she gave away 4 of them. So, Faye has 31 pens left (35 - 4 = 31). Now, we are told that each of the four pens she gave away was worth two points. Therefore, the total number of points gained from giving those pens away is 8 (4 x 2 = 8). Finally, we are asked how many points Faye gained overall from all her actions during the game. Since she gained 8 points from giving away the four pens, and she also gained 31 points for having 31 pens left after giving away the four pens, Faye gained a total of 39 points (8 + 31 = 39) during the game.
Response:  We are given that Faye had 31 pens and she gave away 6 pens. So, the number of pens left with her is 31 - 6 = 25 pens. Now, we are asked to find out how many pens were in each bag containing 19 bags. To do this, we divide the total number of pens (25) by the number of bags (19). Therefore, there were approximately 1.36 pens in each bag (25 / 19 = 1.36).
Response:  We are given that Faye has 30 pens and 71 pencils in total. Out of these, she has 24 pens and 47 pencils in each box. So, the number of pens Faye has is 24/3 = 8.
Response:  We are given that Faye has 30 pens and he wants to divide them equally among his friends in groups of 4. So, he will give each group 7 pens (30/4 = 7). Now, we are asked how many pens Faye will have left after giving away all these pens. To find out, we subtract the number of pens he gave away from the total number of pens he had (30 - 7 = 23). Therefore, Faye has 23 pens left.
Response:  We have 21 schools and 98 students. If each student has one bag, then we have bags = 98. Now, if each bag contains an average of 5 books (vitabu), then we have total number of books = 98 x 5 = 490 books. Finally, since there are 7 days in a week, we have total number of weeks = 7. Therefore, the total number of bags needed to accommodate all these books is bags = 490 / 7 = 69 bags.
Response:  The number of students who passed their KCPE exams is 84. Out of these, 95 were admitted to secondary school. However, only 118 vehicles were provided for transportation of students. Therefore, the number of students who did not get a vehicle is 118 - 95 = 23. So, there are 23 students who did not get a vehicle.
Response:  The number of students in each class is given as 67. Since there are 6 classes, the total number of students in the school is 6 x 67 = 392. However, since some students may be absent due to sickness or other reasons, let's assume that only 60% of the total number of students attend school every day, which is 392 x 0.6 = 248. Therefore, the number of students who will go for the field trip is 248 - 66 (the number of students already in the school) = 182.
Response:  The number of students in each class is given as 58. Since there are 10 classes, the total number of students in the school is 58 x 10 = 580. Now, since there are two buses for transportation, and each bus can carry 36 students, we have 2 x 36 = 72 students who will be transported per day. Therefore, the remaining 498 - 72 = 426 students will walk to school.
Response:  The number of students in each class is given as 120. Since there are 3 classes, the total number of students in all classes is 120 x 3 = 360. Now, we are told that there are 84 students per school. Therefore, the total number of schools required to accommodate all the students is 360 / 84 = 4.25 schools. So, the answer is 4 schools.
Response:  We have 102 students in total and we want to know how many will go for the trip. If 22 students are going, then the remaining number is 102 - 22 = 80 students who won't go for the trip. Therefore, the answer is 80.
Response:  We have 102 students in school and 99 of them are in class one. If 8 students went for a trip, then the number of students who did not go for the trip is 102 - 8 = 94. Therefore, 94 students did not go for the trip.
Response:  We have 72 schools and each school has an average of 3 students per classroom. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total number of students = Number of schools x Average number of students per classroom Total number of students = 72 x 3 = 216 students. So, there are approximately 216 students on this safari.
Response:  We have 17 schools and each school has an average of 46 students. Therefore, we have 46 x 17 = 782 students in all the schools combined. Since there are 92 students per classroom, we can deduce that there are 782 / 92 = 8 classes in total. So, the answer is 8 classes.
Response:  If Darasani has 11 friends who like to eat mangoes and each of them eats one mango per day, then in total they will eat 11 x 1 = 11 mangoes per day. However, if Haley allows only 9 people to eat mangoes per day, then the total number of mangoes that will be eaten is 11 - 9 = 2 mangoes less than what Darasani's group would have eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is 9 mangoes.
Response:  If Haley has 10 apples and gives away 5 to her friend, how many apples does she have left? So, Haley has 10 - 5 = 5 apples left.
Response:  If Darasani has 4 apples and wants to share them equally among his friends, he will have to give each friend 1 apple. Now, if Haley has 23 oranges and wants to distribute them equally among her friends, she will have to give each friend 1 orange. Therefore, the number of oranges that Haley will give to each friend is 15. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  According to the question, Darasani has 13 friends who like him and 50 friends who don't like him. If Haley likes Darasani, then he is one of the 13 friends who like him. Therefore, there are 13 - 1 = 12 people who don't like Haley. Since Haley is 26 years old, if each person who doesn't like him is aged 50, then there are 12 x 50 = 600 people who are older than Haley.
Response:  If there are 20 people who want to eat bulging rice and each person wants to take 3 portions, then we have 60 portions of bulging rice in total (20 x 3 = 60). Now, if 5 people share one portion among themselves, then they will have 12 portions of bulging rice in total (5 x 12 = 60). So, the remaining 54 portions of bulging rice will be left for the other 15 people (60 - 12 = 54).
Response:  If Haley had 10 marbles and gave away 5 to her friend, then she has 5 marbles left. If she then received another 5 marbles from her friend, she now has 10 marbles in total (the original 5 + the new 5). So, if she had 28 marbles in total, that means she had 18 marbles before giving any away (28 - 10 = 18).
Response:  The book has 392 pages and is read for 14 days. To calculate how many pages are read per day, we divide the number of pages by the number of days: 392 / 14 = 27 pages per day. Therefore, in one week (7 days), approximately 185 pages will be read (27 x 7). In two weeks (14 days), approximately 369 pages will be read (185 x 2).
Response:  The book has 22 pages and Frank read it for 569 days. To find out how many times he read each page, we can divide the number of days by the number of pages: 569 / 22 = 25.83. So, Frank read each page approximately 25.83 times.
Response:  According to the question, Frank read 612 pages of a book in chapter 24. If he reads one page every six days, then he will finish reading the book in 6 x 612 = 3672 days. So, Frank took approximately 3672 days or about 9 years and 8 months to finish reading the book.
Response:  The number of verses in each chapter is given as follows: Sura 1 has 786 verses, Sura 2 has 690 verses, and so on until Surah 5 with 555 verses. Therefore, if we want to calculate how many verses there are in total, we can add up all these numbers: 786 + 690 + 555 = 2,031. So, there are exactly 2,031 verses in the entire Quran.
Response:  According to the question, there are 193 verses in chapter 15 of the Bible. If we divide this number by 660 (the number of days it takes to read the entire Bible), we get approximately 0.29 verses per day. So, the answer is 0.29.
Response:  If each book has 249 pages and Frank reads one book every three days, then he will read all books in 86 days (249 x 3 = 747). So, the answer is 86 days.
Response:  According to the problem statement, each book has 66 pages and Frank read one book every 12 days. Therefore, he reads all books in 492 days (12 x 40 = 480). However, since he started reading from page 1 of the first book, he will have read 66 pages per day for the remaining days (i.e., 492 - 480 = 12 days), which is equal to 7 pages per day. So, the total number of pages Frank read is 7 x 12 = 84 pages.
Response:  We are given that there were 16 days in which Frank read books. Since he read 50 books per day, the total number of books he read is: 50 x 16 = 800 books. Now, we are asked how many pages these books had. According to the passage, each book had 300 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages Frank read is: 800 x 300 = 240,000 pages.
Response:  If Frank read 8 pages per day and there were 576 pages in the book, it would take him approximately 74 days to finish reading the entire book (576 / 8 = 74).
Response:  We know that Frank read 30 pages of the book in one day. The book has 450 pages in total. So, we can calculate how many days it will take for Frank to finish reading the entire book as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day = 450 / 30 = 15 days Therefore, Frank will need 15 days to finish reading the entire book if he reads at a rate of 30 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 100 verses in each chapter (surah) of the Quran. So, if we multiply 100 with the number of chapters (which is given as 594), we get the total number of verses in the Quran: 
594 x 100 = 59,400 verses. Therefore, the answer to the question is 59,400."
Response:  According to the problem, Frank read 664 pages in 1 week (7 days). If we divide this number by 7, we get 95 pages per day. Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read each hour. We can do this by dividing the daily pages by 24 hours (the number of hours in a day). So, if Frank read 95 pages per day, he read 3.8 pages per hour (95 / 24 = 3.8).
Response:  If we have 120 packs of DVDs and each pack contains 5 discs, then... (calculate)
Response:  We are given that there are 81 packets of rice and we want to know how many packets will fit in 33 DVD cases. To do this, we need to divide 81 by 33, which gives us approximately 2.5 packets per case. So, approximately 25 packets of rice will fit in 33 DVD cases.
Response:  The number of questions asked is 107 and we are given that each question has 4 options. So, if one option is selected for every question, then the total number of options selected will be 107 x 4 = 428. Therefore, the number of options selected from question 106 to question 107 is 428 - 93 = 335.
"Response:  If there are 76 DVDs and each box contains 25 DVDs, then we have:
76 DVDs / 25 DVDs per box = 3 boxes
So, if you want to know how many boxes of DVDs you will get, the answer is 3 boxes."
"Response:  We are given that una pack ya DVD inagharimu dola 26 and uma dola 104. To find out how many DVDs can fit in one pack, we need to divide the number of DVDs that can fit in one box (dola 104) by the number of boxes needed to fill one pack (dola 26). So, the answer is:

Number of DVDs per pack = 104 / 26 = 4
Therefore, there are 4 DVDs in each pack."
"Response:  If there are 28 days in a month and we have 2 DVDs, then each DVD has how many days? 
So, the answer is 14 (days per DVD)."
"Response:  If there are 18 bananas in total and each one weighs approximately 0.5 kg, then the total weight of all the bananas is:

18 x 0.5 = 9 kg
So, if you want to know how many bags of 2 kg each can be filled with these bananas, you can divide the total weight by the weight of each bag:

9 kg / 2 kg = 4.5 bags
Therefore, you can fill 4.5 bags of 2 kg each with the 18 bananas."
"Response:  The total number of mangoes in Philip's basket is 187. If each mango weighs approximately 150 grams, then the total weight of all the mangoes is:

187 x 150 = 28,650 grams

Now, let's convert this weight to kilograms:

28,650 / 1000 = 28.65 kg

Therefore, there are approximately 28.65 kilograms of mangoes in Philip's basket."
"Response:  We are given that there are 203 bananas in total and 63 of them were eaten by Philip. So, we have to find out how many bananas were left after Philip ate 63 of them. From the problem statement, we know that 7 bananas were left uneaten in Vikundi 1 and 95 bananas were left uneaten in Vikundi 95. Therefore, the number of bananas left after Philip ate 63 of them is:
(Number of bananas left in Vikundi 1) + (Number of bananas left in Vikundi 95) = 7 + 95 = 102
So, there were 102 bananas left after Philip ate 63 of them."
Response:  We are given that there are 142 bananas in total and 356 apples in total. From the problem statement, we know that 47 of the bananas were eaten and 178 of the apples were eaten. To find out how many apples were left uneaten, we can subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples: 356 - 178 = 178. Therefore, there are 178 apples left uneaten.
Response:  We are given that there are 196 fruits in total and Philip has eaten 392 of them. So, we need to find out how many fruits Philip did not eat. To do this, we subtract the number of fruits he ate from the total number of fruits:  196 - 392 = -196. Therefore, one big fruit is equal to -196.
Response:  If there are 180 people in total and each person eats 3 bananas per day, then the total number of bananas consumed per day is: 180 x 3 = 540 bananas per day.
Response:  We are given that there are 87 birds in total and 290 eggs in total. From the information provided, we know that 1 bird lays 2 eggs, so the number of birds laying eggs is 87/2 = 43.5 birds. Since each bird lays 2 eggs, the total number of eggs laid is 43.5 x 2 = 87 eggs. Therefore, the answer is 87 eggs.
Response:  We are given that there are 384 bananas and 192 oranges in a basket. From this information, we can calculate the ratio of bananas to oranges as follows: Bananas: Oranges = 384 : 192 = 2:1 Therefore, if there are 345 apples and 16 pears in another basket, the ratio of apples to pears is: Apples: Pears = 345 : 16 = 22:1 So, the number of apples is twice that of pears.
Response:  If there are 38 biscuits and each box contains 19 biscuits, then we can calculate the number of boxes as follows: 38 / 19 = 2. So, there will be 2 boxes of biscuits.
Response:  If there are 14 people in total and each person has an average of 30 pieces of candy, then the total number of candies is: 14 x 30 = 420.
Response:  We are given that there are 5 people in total and each person has eaten an average of 22 biscuits but some have eaten less than that. So, if we divide the total number of biscuits (22) by the number of people (5), we get the average number of biscuits consumed per person = 4.4. However, since not everyone ate exactly 4.4 biscuits, we can round up to the nearest whole number which is 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 people in total and each person has eaten 2 biscuits. Therefore, the total number of biscuits eaten is 10 x 2 = 20. Now, we are asked how many biscuits will be left if 9 people have already eaten their share and 1 more person wants to eat 3 biscuits. So, the remaining biscuits will be 20 - (9 x 2) = 6. Therefore, one person will get 3 biscuits.
"Response:  If there are 10 people in total and each person has 5 pieces of cake, then how many pieces of cake will be left for everyone after they have eaten their share?
So, if we divide 50 (the total number of pieces of cake) by 10 (the number of people), we get 5 as the result. Therefore, there will be 5 pieces of cake left for everyone after they have eaten their share."
Response:  We are given that there are 5 people in total and each person has 2 biscuits. Therefore, the total number of biscuits is 5 x 2 = 10 biscuits. So, the answer is 10 biscuits.
Response:  If Frank had 42 eggs in his pocket and he gave away 2 eggs per mile walked, how many eggs would he have left after walking 10 miles? So, if he walked 10 miles, he would give away 2 x 10 = 20 eggs. Therefore, he would be left with 42 - 20 = 22 eggs.
Response:  If there are 26 students in total and they are divided into groups of 33 each, then the number of students who will be left out is 26 - 33 = -7. Therefore, Frank had no vipende vya pipi.
Response:  We are given that there were 33 vipende and we removed 24 of them. So, the remaining number of vipende is 33 - 24 = 9. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  If there are 11 vipende in total and each vipende has 22 vya pipi, then the total number of vya pipi is: 11 x 22 = 242 vya pipi. Therefore, the correct answer is 242.
Response:  If there were 16 pebbles in one pipe and each pipe had 40 pipes, then the total number of pebbles would be: 16 x 40 = 640.
Response:  We are given that there are 25 students in Trefoils and we need to find out how many of them have at least one parent who is an engineer. So, let X be the number of such students. Now, we know that each student has exactly two parents (one mother and one father), so the total number of parents is 2X. Since there are 14 engineers among the parents, the proportion of engineers among all parents is 14/2X. Therefore, the answer is X = 7.
"Response:  We are given that there are 10 trefoils in total and we need to find out how many of them will be left if 5 of them are taken away. So, let X represent the number of trefoils remaining after taking 5 away from the total of 10. According to the problem statement, ""kuna masanduku mangapi katika kila kesi ikiwa anahitaji kusafirisha masanduku 5"". This means that 5 trefoils have been removed or taken away. Therefore, the number of trefoils remaining is equal to the original number of trefoils minus the number of trefoils taken away which is 10 - 5 = 5. So, the answer is 5."
Response:  Chupa 67 for soda ya kawaida is equal to 10 x 6.7 = 67. Similarly, chupa 9 for soda ya lishe is also equal to 10 x 0.9 = 9. Therefore, the difference between the two amounts of money is: 67 - 9 = 58. So, the amount of money that is more than soda ya lishe is 58.
Response:  Chupa 22 for soda ya kawaida is equal to 4 times chupa 5 (since there are 4 sodas in total). Similarly, chupa 61 for soda ya lishe is also equal to 4 times chupa 15 (since there are 4 sodas in total). Therefore, ni chupa ngapi za soda ya lishe waidi kuliko soda ya kawaida walikuwa nazo. The answer is 4 x 15 = 60.
Response:  We are given that duka la vyakula has 30 pieces of soda for kawaida, 8 pieces of soda for lishe, and 41 pieces of matofaa. To find out the total number of pieces of soda, we need to add these numbers together. Therefore, the answer is: 30 + 8 + 41 = 79.
"Response:  The total number of sodas available is 106 (79 + 53). Now, let's calculate the number of sodas for each category:
Kawaida - 79 sodas x Rate = 79 x 42/100 = 328
Lishe - 53 sodas x Rate = 53 x 42/100 = 220
Total Number of Sodas = Kawaida + Lishe = 328 + 220 = 548
Therefore, the number of sodas available for lishe is more than kawaida by 548 - 328 = 220."
Response:  Chupa 54 for soda ya lishe means that there are 54 bottles of soda in a crate of lishe. Similarly, chupa 83 for soda ya kawaida means that there are 83 bottles of soda in a crate of kawaida. Now, let's calculate the total number of bottles of soda in both crates combined: Crate of Lishe: 54 x 6 = 324 bottles of soda Crate of Kawaida: 83 x 7 = 571 bottles of soda Total number of bottles of soda in both crates combined: 324 + 571 = 895 bottles of soda Therefore, the answer is 895.
Response:  We are given that there were 17 people who drank tea and 9 of them drank soda. So, the number of people who did not drink either tea or soda is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, the number of people who drank soda was 9.
Response:  Chupa 19 for soda ya lishe is equal to 3/5 of chupa 60 for soda ya kawaida. Therefore, walikuwa na chupa ngapi za soda ya kawaida zaidi kuliko soda ya lishe. The answer is 72 (chupa 60 + chupa 19).
Response:  If duka has 72 bottles of soda and he gives away 32 bottles to his friend, then he will have 40 bottles left (72 - 32 = 40). Now, if we add the number of bottles that Tafadhali gave him (78), then Duka will have a total of 118 bottles (40 + 78 = 118). So, the correct answer is 118.
"Response:  We have been given two quantities of different items as follows:
Quantity of duka = 36
Quantity of soda = 80
Now we need to find out how many bags of soda are required to fill up 36 bags of duka. To do this, we divide the quantity of soda (80) by the capacity of each bag of soda (10 kg). This gives us:
Number of bags of soda needed = 80/10 = 8
So, we require 8 bags of soda to fill up 36 bags of duka. Therefore, the answer is 8."
"Response:  We are given that duka la vyakula lilikuwa na jumla ya chupa 30. This means that there are 30 units of liquid in the container. Now we are asked how many bottles of soda can be filled from this amount. The answer is simple; since each bottle contains 28 ml of soda, we can fill 30/28 = 1.07 bottles of soda from the given amount of liquid. Therefore, the number of bottles of soda that can be filled from the given amount of liquid is 1."
"Response:  The cost of one liter of soda is Kshs 4 for lishe and Kshs 79 for kawaida. To find out how many liters of soda can be bought with Kshs 100, we need to divide the amount of money by the cost per liter. So, if we have Kshs 100, we can buy:
Kshs 100 / Kshs 4 = 25 liters of soda for lishe
Kshs 100 / Kshs 79 = 1.26 liters of soda for kawaida
Therefore, the number of liters of soda that can be bought with Kshs 100 is: 25 + 1.26 = 26.26 liters."
"Response:  We are given that duka has 57 bottles of soda, and each bottle contains 3 liters. Therefore, the total volume of soda in duka is:
57 x 3 = 171 liters."
"Response:  The number of cans of each type of soda are as follows:
Kawida - 81 cans
Lishe - 60 cans
Mwanga - 60 cans
To determine which type of soda has more cans, we need to compare the total number of cans for each type. So, let's add up all the numbers:
Total Kawida cans = 81 + 81 +... + 81 (since there are multiple cans) = 3270
Total Lishe cans = 60 + 60 +... + 60 = 1440
Total Mwanga cans = 60 + 60 +... + 60 = 1440
As you can see, the total number of cans for Lishe is higher than that of Kawida and Mwanga combined. Therefore, the answer is (D)."
Response:  The total number of sodas is 12 (49 + 40 + 6). So, if we divide the total number of sodas by the number of types of sodas, we get: Total number of sodas / Number of types of sodas = 12/3 = 4.
Response:  If there were 317 people who witnessed Jumba la Buckingham in the beginning and now only 295 are left, then we can deduce that 22 people have left or abandoned their witnessing of Jumba la Buckingham. Therefore, the number of people who witnessed Jumba la Buckingham initially is 295 - 22 = 273.
Response:  We are given that there were 703 guests at Jumba la Buckingham's party and they took an average of 246 photos with him per day. To find out how many photos Jumba la Buckingham has taken in total, we can multiply the number of days by the average number of photos taken per day: Total Photos = Number of Days x Average Photos Taken Per Day Total Photos = 703 x 246 = 168,980 photos
Response:  If there were 100 people who wanted to see Jumba la Buckingham and they could only fit 666 in his office at one time, then we can calculate the number of times these 100 people would have to visit him per day as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of people x Capacity of the office / Number of people that can fit in the office at one time Visitors per day = Number of visitors x Number of days (in this case, 30 days) So, if there were 100 people who wanted to see Jumba la Buckingham and they could only fit 666 in his office at one time, then they would have to visit him approximately 33 times per day (100/666 x 30).
Response:  We are given that there were 132 guests at Jumba la Buckingham and they consumed an average of 5 portions each. Therefore, the total number of portions eaten is 132 x 5 = 660 portions. Since we are asked how many people would have eaten if 406 guests had visited, we can simply divide the total number of portions by the number of guests who visited, which gives us 660 / 406 = 1.59 portions per guest. So, approximately 1.6 portions per guest were eaten.
Response:  We are given that there were 45 people who went to see Jumba la Buckingham in total. And we want to know how many of them visited him on average per day. So, let's divide the total number of visitors (45) by the number of days they visited him (85). Therefore, the average number of visitors per day is 0.53 or 53%.
Response:  We are given that there were 71 people in front of Buckingham Palace and we want to know how many will be left after 57 days. So, if each person stays for an average of 3 days (since they arrive every day), then the number of people who will be left after 57 days is:  71 x (1 - 0.6) = 42. Therefore, only 42 people will be left after 57 days.
"Response:  If there were 39 people in front of Buckingham Palace at first (including Rachel), and they increased to 661 after 2 weeks, then the average number of people per day for those two weeks is:

Average = Total people / Number of days = 661 / 14 = 47.857 (approximately)
So, there were approximately 47.857 more people than the initial 39 during that period."
Response:  If there were 92 people who wanted to see Jumba la Buckingham and they were divided into groups of 419 and 103 before time ran out, then after time ran out, there would be 419 - 103 = 316 people left who had not seen Jumba la Buckingham. Therefore, the number of people who did not get to see Jumba la Buckingham is 316.
Response:  We are given that there were 512 people who watched Jumba la Buckingham in total. Out of these, 471 people watched him twice and 808 people watched him once before he passed away. So, the number of people who watched Jumba la Buckingham altogether is:  512 - (471 x 2) = 360. Therefore, the correct answer is 360.
Response:  We are given that there were 705 guests at Jumba la Buckingham and they consumed an average of 3 meals per person per day. Therefore, the total number of meals consumed was 705 x 3 = 2115 meals. Now we need to find out how many meals were eaten by guests who had been at Jumba la Buckingham for more than 2 weeks (191 days). So, let's subtract the number of meals eaten by these guests from the total number of meals consumed: 2115 - 191 = 1924 meals. Finally, we need to divide the number of meals left by the number of days between the two points in time to get the average number of meals eaten per day: 1924 / (245 days) = 8 meals per day.
Response:  We are given that there are 159 students who have not paid their school fees and we need to find out how many of them will be able to pay their school fees if each student pays $628. So, we can start by dividing the number of students who haven't paid their school fees (159) by the amount they need to pay ($628). This gives us our first calculation:  159 / $628 = x. Now, since we know that x is a whole number greater than zero, we can round up this value to get our final answer: x = 70. Therefore, 70 students will be able to pay their school fees.
Response:  We are given that there are 49 people in one group and we need to find out how many groups of 5 people can be formed from this population. So, we divide the total number of people (49) by 5 to get the number of groups that can be formed: 49 / 5 = 9.8. Since you cannot have a fraction of a group, round up to the nearest whole number which is 10 groups. Therefore, there can be 10 groups of 5 people each in this population.
Response:  We are given that there are 57 people who have been infected with COVID-19 and have recovered together with their contacts. This means that they were in quarantine for at least 14 days. Therefore, we can deduce that the number of people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 is equal to the number of people who have been infected minus those who have died (assuming no one has died). So, let X be the total number of people who have fully recovered from COVID-19. From the question, we know that X + 57 = 353, where 57 is the number of people who have been infected and recovered together with their contacts. Solving for X, we get X = 266. Therefore, the number of people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 is 266.
Response:  If there are currently 15 people who will be accommodated in the hostel and each person requires 3 square meters of space, then we need to calculate how much space is required for all 15 people. Therefore, the total area needed = (Number of people x Required area per person) = 15 x 3 = 45 square meters. Now if we want to know how many more people can fit in the same amount of space after adding another 20 people, we simply divide the available space by the required area per person. So, the number of additional people that can fit = Available space / Required area per person = 45 / 3 = 15 people.
Response:  We are given that there are 557 people in total and we need to find out how many pairs of friends they have made together. Since each person has at most 30 friends, we can deduce that the number of pairs is less than or equal to 557 x 30 = 16680. Therefore, the answer is 16680.
Response:  We are given that there are 11 people who will be sitting together and we have to find out how many seats they will occupy. Since each person needs one seat, if all 11 sit together, they will occupy 11 seats. Now, let's calculate the number of extra seats needed. If there are 492 chairs available, then the total number of occupied seats is 11 + (492 - 11) = 503 seats. Therefore, the answer is 503.
"Response:  We are given that Akiwa has 100 kg of maize and he wants to sell it at Sh 90 per kilogram. If he sells it for 6 days, how much money will he make in total?
Firstly, we need to calculate the number of kilograms sold per day. Since Akiwa sells 90 kg of maize per day, we can write this as:
90 kg/day = 90 x 100 = 9000 kg/week (since there are 7 days in a week)
Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned from selling maize over 6 days:
Total amount earned = Number of kilograms sold x Selling price per kilogram
= 9000 kg/week x Sh 90/kg
= Sh 810,000 (approximately)
Therefore, Akiwa makes approximately Sh 810,000 from selling his maize over 6 days."
Response:  We are given that there are 266 students in total and they will be taking exams for 5 days. Each student will take 90 questions per day. Therefore, the number of questions each student will take per day is 90/5 = 18. So, the total number of questions taken by all students over 5 days is 18 x 5 = 90.
Response:  We are given that there are 305 farmers who planted maize and beans in total. Of these, 294 farmers planted maize, which means they have 244 bags of maize per day. Similarly, 11 farmers planted beans, which means they have 47 bags of beans per day. To find out how many bags of maize each farmer has planted per day, we can divide the number of bags planted by the total number of farmers. So, if we divide 244 by 305, we get approximately 7.78 bags of maize per farmer per day. Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 7.78 bags of maize per farmer per day.
Response:  We are given that there are 235 farmers who planted maize and they harvested 100 bags of maize per day. In total, they harvested 221 bags of maize in one week. To find out how many bags of maize each farmer harvested in one day, we can divide the total number of bags harvested by the number of days it took to harvest them (7 days). So, each farmer harvested 31 bags of maize per day ($ {221}/{7} = $ {31}$).
Response:  We are given that Akiwa has 57 cows and he milks them twice a day to get 252 liters of milk per day. Now we need to find out how many liters of milk Akiwa will have after 58 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of cows (57) by the number of times they are milked per day (twice), which gives us 114 liters of milk per day. Then, if we add the total number of days (58) to the current number of liters of milk (114), we get 1628 liters of milk after 58 days. Therefore, the answer is 1628 liters.
Response:  We are given that Akiwa has 36 bags of maize weighing 90 kg each. Therefore, the total weight of all the bags is:  36 x 90 = 3172 kg. Now, if he wants to sell them at Kshs 2 per kilogram, how much money will he make? So, the total amount of money he will make is: 3172 x 2 = 6344 Kshs.

Response:  We are given that there were 56 water melons and each watermelon had 10 seeds. Therefore, in total, there were 56 x 10 = 560 seeds. Since each seed weighed 39 grams, the total weight of all the seeds was 560 x 39 = 22,440 grams. So, Tyler had 22,440 grams of seeds.
Response:  We are given that there were 74 people who drank water from the well with a depth of 70 feet and 22 people who drank water from the well with a depth of 100 feet. Since each person drank 46 gallons of water, we can calculate the total number of gallons drunk as follows: Total number of gallons = Number of people x Gallons per person Total number of gallons = 74 x 46 + 22 x 46 Total number of gallons = 3384 + 952 Total number of gallons = 4336 gallons Therefore, Tyler drank 4336 gallons of water.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 water melons in a basket and each watermelon weighs 6 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all watermelons is 15 x 6 = 90 kg. Now, we are also told that there are 62 baskets of water melons and each basket contains 19 watermelons. So, the total number of watermelons is 62 x 19 = 1238 watermelons.

Response:  We are given that there were 26 people in total and they shared food equally among themselves. So each person got 52/26 = 2 pieces of bread. Now we are asked how many pieces of bread one person got. Since there were 15 people who did not get any bread (pipi), so the remaining 11 people got 52 - 15 = 37 pieces of bread each. Therefore, the answer is 37.
Response:  We are given that there were 14 people in total and they shared equally among themselves. So each person got an equal share of food (biskuti). If there were 28 pieces of biskuti initially, then each person would have received 28/14 = 2 pieces of biskuti per person. Since there were 86 people in total, including the 14 who shared the initial 28 pieces of biskuti, then the remaining 72 people would have received 28 - 2 = 26 pieces of biskuti each. Therefore, the final number of pieces of biskuti each person had was 2 + 26 = 28 pieces of biskuti per person.
Response:  If there are 100 houses in a certain area and each house has 5 people living in it, then the total population of that area is 100 x 5 = 500 people. However, if there are 25 houses in another area and each house has 7 people living in it, then the total population of that area is 25 x 7 = 175 people. Therefore, the correct answer is (500) - (175) = 325 people.

Now, since each house needs one vipanda, the total number of vipandas needed for all the compounds combined is 252 houses x 1 vipanda/house = 252 vipandas. Therefore, the answer is 252 vipandas.
Response:  We are given that Rebecca has 10 eggs and she wants to share them equally among her 4 friends. So each friend will get 2 eggs per person. Now we are asked how many eggs will be left after Rebecca shares them with her friends. Therefore, the number of eggs left = total number of eggs - number of eggs shared with friends. Total number of eggs = 10 eggs. Number of eggs shared with friends = 4 friends x 2 eggs/friend = 8 eggs. So the number of eggs left after sharing = total number of eggs - number of eggs shared with friends = 10 eggs - 8 eggs = 2 eggs.
"Response:  We are given that Rebecca has 10 eggs and she wants to make 15 omelets. So, we need to find out how many eggs will be left after making 15 omelets with 10 eggs.

Response:  We are given that there are 5 friends in total and each friend has at least one secret. Therefore, we can say that the number of secrets is equal to the number of friends multiplied by at least one (since each friend has at least one secret). So, the number of secrets is 5 x 1 = 5.
Response:  We are given that there are 11 friends in total and each friend has 28 pets. So, the total number of pets is 11 x 28 = 308 pets. Therefore, Emily had 308 pets.
"Response:  If Emily can make 8 cups of tea using 1 cup of water and she uses 16 cups of water in total, then we can calculate as follows:
Emily can make 8/1 = 8 cups of tea using 1 cup of water.
So, if she uses 16 cups of water in total, then she will be able to make 16 / 1 = 16 cups of tea."
Response:  We are given that Emily has 18 friends and each friend has 5 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets is 18 x 5 = 90 pets.
Response:  We are given that there are five friends and each friend has at least one pet. So, in total, we have 5 x 1 = 5 pets. Now, according to the passage, Emily had no pets. Therefore, the number of pets owned by Emily is 0. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  We are given that there are 72 friends in total and each friend has at least one hobby. So, the number of hobbies is 72 x 1 = 72. Now we are asked how many hobbies Emily can handle. Since she can handle 6 hobbies, the number of hobbies Emily can handle is 72 - 6 = 66. Therefore, Emily can handle 66 hobbies.
Response:  The number of friends that Emily has is 43. Each friend has 5 pets and each pet produces 20 droppings per day. Therefore, the total number of droppings produced by all pets in one day is:  43 x 5 = 215 droppings/day
Response:  We are given that there are 44 friends in total and each friend has at least one secret. Therefore, the number of secrets is 44 x 1 = 44. Since Emily knows 26 secrets, we can deduce that she does not know all the secrets (44 - 26 = 18). So, Emily does not know any secrets.
Response:  The number of children who have been abducted is given as 819058 and the number of children who are still missing is given as 668278. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:  819058 - 668278 = 150780. So, there are 150780 more children who were abducted than those who are still missing.
Response:  The number of children who are in school is 202958 and they come from the county of Lawrence. Therefore, we need to find out how many more children there are compared to those who go to school. To do this, we subtract the number of children who attend school (202958) from the total number of children (777622). This gives us a difference of 574634 children who do not attend school.
Response:  The total number of children is given as 898,051. Of these, 629,424 are living with their families, while the remaining 268,627 are not living with their families. Therefore, the number of children who are not living with their families is 268,627.
Response:  The number of children is given as 313473 and they are divided into groups of 274865 each. So, there will be 120 groups (313473 / 274865 = 120). Therefore, the answer is 120.
Response:  We are given that there are 907,611 children in total and we need to find out how many of them live in each county. So, let's divide the total number of children by the number of counties (455,682). Therefore, the number of children who live in each county is:  907,611 / 455,682 = 2.03 children per county.
Response:  The number of children who are not living with their parents is given as 8000 - 463 = 7537. Since there are 1000 children per county, the number of counties that have at least one child who is not living with their parents is 7537 / 1000 = 7.537 counties. Therefore, there are approximately 7 counties that have at least one child who is not living with their parents.
Response:  We are given that there are 61,619 children aged between 0-5 in Lawrence County and we want to know how many of them will be left behind if 30% of them are taken away. So, we can use this formula: (Total number of children x Percentage taken away) / 100 = Number of children left behind. Now, let's plug in the values we have been given: Total number of children = 61,619 Percentage taken away = 30% (which is the same as 0.3) Number of children left behind = (61,619 x 0.3) / 100 = 18,484 Therefore, approximately 18,484 children will be left behind in Lawrence County if 30% of the total number of children aged between 0-5 are taken away.
Response:  We are given that there are 34,044 children in the area of ​​Lawrence who have been vaccinated and another 134,867 children in the same area who have not been vaccinated. Therefore, the total number of unvaccinated children in the area is 134,867 - 34,044 = 100,823.
Response:  We are given that there are 610769 children in total and we need to find out how many of them come from the district of Lawrence. So, let's divide the total number of children by the number of children from Lawrence:  610769 / 590796 = 1.0834... (approximately 1.08) Therefore, approximately 1083 children come from the district of Lawrence.
Response:  The total number of children in the area is given as 644997. We are asked to find out how many will go to school. To do this, we need to subtract the number who cannot attend school from the total number of children. According to the passage, 893835 children cannot attend school because they live too far away or have other problems. So, the number of children who can attend school is:  644997 - 893835 = 201062. Therefore, there are 201062 children who will go to school in the area of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that Adam scored 3 more than Jackie. So, if Jackie scored 9, then Adam scored 12 (9 + 3). Therefore, Jackie scored 9 + 3 = 12.
Response:  If Adam scored 10 points and Jackie scored 2 points, then we can say that Adam scored more than twice as many points as Jackie. So, if A is Adam and J is Jackie, we can write: A > 2J.
"Response:  The correct order is as follows:
Jackie > Adam (since Jackie comes after Adam in alphabetical order)
So, Jackie ana matofaa 10."
Response:  We are given that Jackie scored 10 and Adam scored 8. To find out who scored more than the other, we need to compare their scores directly. Therefore, Jackie scored more than Adam because 10 is greater than 8. So, the correct answer is (A) Jackie scored more than Adam.
Response:  We are given that Pamoja has scored 6 points and Adam and Jackie have scored 4 points each. So, in total, they have scored 10 points (6 + 4 + 4). Therefore, the difference between their scores is 2 points (10 - 8 = 2).
Response:  If Adam and Jackie want to have 7 children together, then they will need to have 2 children each. So, Adam will have 1 child with Jackie and Jackie will also have 1 child with Adam. Therefore, the total number of children that Adam and Jackie will have is 3 (1 + 1).
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie scored 12 points together. So, if they had scored separately, Adam would have scored at least 9 more than he did with Jackie. Therefore, Adam scored 9 + 8 = 17 points in total.
Response:  We know that Adam scored 4 more than Jackie and together they scored 2 more than 10. So, Adam's score is 4 + 10 = 14. Therefore, Adam scored 14 points.
Response:  We know that Jackie scored 89 and had 11 questions correct. If we subtract the number of questions she got right from her total score, we get 78 (89 - 11 = 78). So, Adam scored 78 out of 100.
Response:  We know that Helen has 31 teeth in total and she brushes them at 8 am every morning. So, she brushes her teeth for 270 days (or 6 months) until January 15th when she turns 41 years old. Therefore, Helen brushes her teeth for approximately 1,570 hours from January 1st to January 15th.
Response:  We know that Helen has 90 friends and 51 of them are her close friends. This means she has 484 hours in a day (24 x 20). So, if we divide the number of close friends she has with the total number of hours in a day, we get: Close Friends / Total Hours = 51/484 = 0.1037 or approximately 10%. Therefore, Helen's close friends make up about 10% of her total friend count.
Response:  We know that Helen has 527 cookies and she shared them equally among her friends who are 86 in number. So each friend got 6 cookies per person. Now let's find out how many cookies Helen gave to each of her friends. If she gave 6 cookies to each of her 86 friends, then the total number of cookies given by Helen is 6 x 86 = 502 cookies. Therefore, the answer is 502 cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen has eaten 144 biscuits in total and 397 biscuits of chocolate. In addition to this, she has also eaten 85 biscuits of chocolate during the daytime. Therefore, we can calculate the number of biscuits of chocolate that Helen has eaten at night as follows: Number of biscuits of chocolate eaten at night = Total number of biscuits of chocolate - Number of biscuits of chocolate eaten during the daytime Total number of biscuits of chocolate = 397 - 85 = 312 So, Helen has eaten 312 biscuits of chocolate at night.
Response:  The total number of friends that Helen has is 19 + 231 = 250 friends. Now, let's calculate the average number of friends per day for Helen. We can do this by dividing the total number of friends by the number of days she was online (from January 1st to January 19th). So, we divide 250 by 19 = 13.10 friends per day on average. Therefore, the answer is 13.10.
Response:  We know that Helen has eaten 197 cookies and 46 bars of chocolate so far today. She also ate 75 pieces of candy and 66 licorice ropes this morning. To find out how many more cookies she ate than candies, we can subtract their numbers:  197 - 75 = 122. So, Helen ate 122 more cookies than candies today.
Response:  We know that Helen has 519 cookies and 300 balls. She also has 280 gummies and 359 crackers. To find out how many more gummies she has than crackers, we can subtract their numbers:  300 (balls) - 280 (gummies) = 20. So, Helen has 20 more gummies than crackers. Now, let's calculate how many more gummies she has than cookies:  519 (cookies) - 300 (balls) = 219. Therefore, Helen has 219 more cookies than balls. Finally, to determine how many more gummies she has than cookies, we subtract their numbers again:  219 (cookies) - 20 (gummies) = 199. So, Helen has 199 more gummies than cookies.
Response:  The total number of friends in group A is 81 and they have a total score of 810. The total number of friends in group B is 59 and their collective score is 590. Therefore, the difference between the two groups is 220 (810 - 590). So, the answer is 220.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Katie had 91 points in her DS game and 7 friends who played with her regularly. Of these 7 friends, 4 had more than 88 points, while 3 had fewer than 53 points. Therefore, the number of friends who had exactly 88 or fewer points is 4.
"Response: 
Katie had 78 pieces of work in total and completed 86 pieces in the past. Her friends had 48 pieces of work in total. How many pieces did they complete together?
To find out how many pieces her friends completed, we need to subtract the number of pieces Katie completed from the total number of pieces she had. So, if Katie had 78 pieces of work and completed 86, then her friends had 92 - 86 = 7 pieces left. Therefore, Katie and her friends completed 7 + 48 = 55 pieces of work together."
"Response:  The total number of friends in both groups is 8 + 6 = 14. So, if we divide the total number of movies watched among all friends (84) by the number of friends in each group (14), we get: Group A - 84/14 = 6 movies per friend; Group B - 19/14 = 1.35 movies per friend. Since you cannot have a fraction of a movie, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us: Group A - 7 movies per friend; Group B - 2 movies per friend. Therefore, the two groups watched an average of 7 and 2 movies respectively in the past year."
Response:  We are given that Katie had two math problems to solve. The first problem was worth 62 marks and the second problem was worth 80 marks. Her friends also had two math problems to solve. Their first problem was worth 73 marks and their second problem was worth 41 marks. To find out how many marks Katie got in total, we need to add up the marks she scored for each problem. So, the total number of marks Katie scored is: 62 + 80 = 142 marks.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Rafiki and Katie were playing games with each other. Rafiki was playing game number 57 while Katie was playing game number 63. Therefore, Katie played more games than Rafiki. So, the answer is 63 - 57 = 6.
Response:  We are given that Katie had 57 tasks and completed 39 of them in the past. The friends had 34 tasks. To find out how many more tasks Katie completed than her friends, we need to subtract the number of tasks her friends completed from the total number of tasks she completed. So, the answer is:  57 - 34 = 23. Therefore, Katie completed 23 more tasks than her friends.
"Response:  We know that Fred had $60 and gave $33 to Jason. So, what was left with Fred after giving money to Jason?
Fred had $60 - $33 = $27 left with him."
"Response: 
Juma had 86 shillings and gave 10 to Jason. So Juma has 76 shillings left (86 - 10 = 76). Then, Jason received 5 shillings from Juma. Therefore, Jason now has 5 + 10 = 15 shillings in total."
Response:  We know that Juma had 19 apples and Jason had 16 apples initially. After sharing with each other, they got 40 and 69 apples respectively. So, Fred gave away 21 apples (40 - 19 = 21) to get 40 apples from Jason. Therefore, Fred received 40 - 21 = 19 apples from Jason.
Response:  We know that Fred had 114 coins and gave away 21 of them to Jason. So, Fred has 93 coins left (114 - 21 = 93). Now, we are told that Jason received 78 coins from someone else. Therefore, the total number of coins that Jason has is 78 + 21 = 99 coins.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Juma had $111 and gave away $115 to charity. So his remaining amount is $111 - $115 = -$4. Secondly, we know that Jason had $40 and spent $44 on something. So his remaining amount is $40 - $44 = -$4. Therefore, the total amount of money lost by both Juma and Jason is -$4 + (-$4) = -$8.
"Response: 
Juma had 49 wikipedia pages at first and then gained 73 more pages after that. So, his current number of Wikipedia pages is 49 + 73 = 122.
Similarly, Jason started with 3 Wikipedia pages and later gained 63 more pages, so he currently has 3 + 63 = 66 Wikipedia pages."
Response:  We know that Jason had $78 and lost $14. So, his new amount is $64. Now, we are told that Fred had $90 and gave some money to Jason. Therefore, Fred now has $90 - $64 = $26 left.
"Response: 
Jason had $95 and spent $74. So he has $21 left ($95 - $74).
Fred had $33 and spent $16. So he has $17 left ($33 - $16).
Therefore, Fred got $17 from Jason."
Response:  We know that Fred had $47 and gave away $111 to charity, leaving him with $64 ($111 - $47). Then he spent $34 on something else, so his remaining amount is $30 ($64 - $34). Therefore, Fred has $30 left in his pocket at the end of the day.
Response:  If Jessie had 71 grams of sugar at first and then consumed 20 grams less each day, how much does he have now? So, after one day, he has 71 - 20 = 51 grams left. After two days, he has 51 - 20 = 31 grams left, and so on... Therefore, the final amount of sugar that Jessie has is 71 - (number of days x 20) = 71 - (7 x 20) = 71 - 14 = 57 grams.
Response:  If we start with 1 kg and increase it by 10% every day, after 3 days we will have 1.03 x 1 = 1.03 kg. After 5 days, we will have 1.03 x 1.03 = 1.06 kg. And so on... So, the answer is 1.06 kg.
Response:  If Jessie walked for 5 hours and covered 126 kilometers, then he walked at a rate of 126/5 = 25 kilometers per hour. After walking for another 3 hours (from 25 km/h), he would have covered 25 x 3 = 75 kilometers. Therefore, he walked a total distance of 75 + 126 = 201 kilometers in 8 hours.
Response:  If Jessie walked for 10 minutes every day and covered a distance of 35 kilometers in total, then he would have walked a distance of 35 x 10 = 350 kilometers in one month (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Now, if he increased his walking time to 2 hours per day, then he would cover a distance of 350 x 2 = 700 kilometers in another month. However, since he only walked for 2 hours per day, the total distance he covered was 700 / 2 = 350 kilometers. Therefore, Uzito had gained 350 - 35 = 315 kilograms.
Response:  If Jessie had 114 grams of sugar at first and then gave away half (57 grams), he would have 57 grams left. Later, he received another 33 grams from his friend, bringing his total to 90 grams (57 + 33). Finally, if he gave away 20 grams more, he would be left with 70 grams (90 - 20 = 70). So, the final amount of sugar that Jessie has is 70 grams.
Response:  The weight of 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams (kg x g = 1000). So if we divide the weight of 62 kg by the weight of 1 kg, we get 62/1000 = 0.062. Therefore, the number of units of weight that were lost in one day is 0.062.
Response:  If Jessie had 92 grams of sugar at first and then consumed half of it (which is 46 grams), he would have 46 grams left after consuming half. Then, if he consumed another quarter of the remaining amount (which is 13 grams), he would have 33 grams left. Finally, if he consumed another third of the remaining amount (which is 20 grams), he would have 13 grams left. Therefore, the final amount of sugar that Jessie had was 13 grams.
Response:  We are given that there were 95 tortoises and 61 snakes in the zoo. If we subtract the number of snakes from the total number of animals, we get 34 (95 - 61). Now, let's find out how many tortoises were left after some of them escaped. According to the question, if 64 tortoises escaped, then the remaining tortoises would be 34 - 64 = -30. So, the answer is -30.
Response:  We are given that there were 93 snakes in the zoo and 97 non-venomous snakes. Out of these non-venomous snakes, 40 were venomous. So, we need to find out how many non-venomous snakes were not venomous. Non-venomous snakes - Venomous snakes = Total number of non-venomous snakes. Therefore, the answer is (97 - 40) = 57.
Response:  We have 3 snakes (nyoka) and 75 birds (mamba). So, in total we have 3 + 75 = 78 creatures. Now, let's see how many of each creature are left after 82 snakes and 19 birds have been taken away. For snakes, we take away 82 from 78, which gives us 96 - 82 = 14 remaining snakes. For birds, we take away 19 from 75, which gives us 56 - 19 = 37 remaining birds. Therefore, out of the original 78 creatures, there are 14 snakes and 37 birds left.
Response:  We are given that there were 79 animals in total at the zoo and we need to find out how many of each type of animal there were. From the information provided, we know that there were 24 snakes (nyoka) and 51 lizards (kizimba). So, if we want to find out how many lizards there were as a percentage of the total number of animals, we can use the formula: Percentage = (Number of lizards / Total number of animals) x 100. Plugging in the values we get: Percentage = (51 / 79) x 100 = 65%. Therefore, lizards made up approximately 65% of all the animals at the zoo.
Response:  We are given that there were 171 birds in the farm at first and after 134 days, there were only 30 left. So, we can calculate the rate of decrease as follows: Number of birds decreased = Total number of birds x Rate of decrease (in percentage) / 100 Total number of birds - Initial number of birds = 30 x (134/171) x 100 / 100 = 25% Therefore, there were 25% less birds in the farm after 134 days compared to the initial number.
Response:  We are given that there were 160 birds in the tree at first and 56 of them flew away after 41 days. So, the number of birds left in the tree after 41 days is: 160 - 56 = 104 birds. Therefore, the answer is 104.
Response:  We are given that there were 90 workers in the farm and they harvested 154 bags of maize per day. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bags of maize each worker harvested per day as follows: Number of bags of maize harvested per day = Total number of bags of maize harvested / Number of workers in the farm = 154 bags/day / 90 workers = 17 bags/worker/day.
Response:  We are given that there were 175 birds in total and they made 77 nests in their own tree. So, each bird built an average of 2.26 nests (175/77). Now, we are asked how many nests would a single bird build if it had 172 nesting sites available to it? To find this out, we can divide the number of nesting sites by the number of birds, which gives us 172/175 = 0.98 or approximately 1 nest per bird. Therefore, a single bird would build approximately 1 nest if it had 172 nesting sites available to it.
Response:  We are given that there were 177 birds in total and 12 of them died in the forest. If we subtract the number of dead birds from the total number of birds, we get 165 alive birds. Now, if 53 of these alive birds migrated to another place, then the remaining birds left behind would be 165 - 53 = 112. Therefore, the correct answer is 112.
"Response:  We are given that there were 105 birds of one species and 71 birds of another species in a certain tree. If we want to find out how many more birds of the first species than the second species, we can use the following formula:
More birds = (Number of birds of first species - Number of birds of second species)
In this case, the number of birds of the first species is 105 and the number of birds of the second species is 71, so we have:
More birds = 105 - 71 = 34
Therefore, there are 34 more birds of the first species than the second species in the tree."
"Response:  The number of bricks required to build a wall that is 10 meters long and has a height of 3 meters can be calculated as follows:

Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the wall using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length of the wall is 10 meters (m) and the width is 3 meters (m), so the area of the wall is:

Area = 10 x 3 = 30 square meters (m²).

Next, we need to convert the area into bricks. We know that one brick covers an area of 0.09 square meters (m²). So, to cover the entire area of the wall with bricks, we will need:

Number of bricks = Area / Size of each brick
= 30 / 0.09
= 330 bricks.

Therefore, if John wants to build a wall that is 10 meters long and has a height of 3 meters using bricks, he will need approximately 330 bricks."
"Response:  The number of bricks required to build a wall that is 13 feet high and has a length of 26 feet can be calculated as follows:

Step 1: Calculate the area of the base of the wall using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width

Length = 26 feet = 8.0 feet (since there are 3 feet in a foot)
Width = 13 feet = 4.9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a foot)
Area = 8.0 x 4.9 = 38.5 square feet

Step 2: Determine how many bricks are needed to cover the area of the base of the wall. Since each brick covers an area of 1 square foot, we need:

Number of bricks = Area / Size of one brick
= 38.5 / 1 = 38.5 bricks

Therefore, John needs 38.5 bricks to build the wall."
Response:  The number of chickens that can fit inside a house is 11. If each chicken takes up space equal to 3 square feet, then the total area occupied by all the chickens will be 3 x 11 = 33 square feet. Now, if we subtract the area occupied by one chicken (which is 2 square feet) from the total area occupied by all the chickens, we get 33 - 2 = 31 square feet. Therefore, John can fit 31 chickens inside his house.
Response:  The total number of bricks needed to build a wall is 12 + 10 = 22 bricks. Since each brick weighs 15 kg and there are 5 small bricks, the total weight of all bricks is 22 x 15 = 330 kg. Therefore, John needs to carry 330 kg of bricks upstairs.
Response:  If there are 16 bricks and each brick weighs 5 kg, then the total weight of all the bricks is 16 x 5 = 80 kg. Now, if John can lift one brick at a time with ease, he will be able to lift all 16 bricks because his strength has not changed. So, the answer is 80 kg.
"Response:  If there are 8 small rooms in a house and each room has 74 items of different sizes, then the total number of items in all the rooms is:

8 x 74 = 592
So, John has 592 items in his room."
Response:  The total number of bricks needed to build a wall that is 12 feet high and 17 feet long can be calculated as follows: Total length = 12 + 17 = 39 feet Total height = 12 feet x 2 = 24 feet Area of one brick = 0.08 square feet (assuming a standard size for bricks) Number of bricks required = Total area / Area per brick = 39 x 24 / 0.08 = 6,750 bricks Therefore, John needs approximately 6,750 bricks to build the wall.
Response:  Vipande 1 = 50, vipande 2 = 75, vipande 3 = 90, and vipande 4 = 42. Therefore, Robin has scored a total of 365 (50 + 75 + 90 + 42) points.
Response:  We know that there are 43 rabbits in total and 23 of them are in each pack. So, we have: Total number of rabbits = Number of rabbits per pack x Number of packs = 43 x 23 = 971 rabbits. Since Robin has 8 rabbits more than the total number of rabbits, we can say that Robin has 971 + 8 = 980 rabbits.
Response:  We are given that there are 7 piles of rice and each pile has 5 kg of rice. So, in total, we have 7 x 5 = 35 kg of rice. Now, we are asked how many bags of 10 kg each can be filled from this amount. To do this, we divide the total weight (35 kg) by the weight of one bag (10 kg), which gives us 35/10 = 3.5 bags. Since you cannot have a fraction of a bag, we round up to 4 bags. Therefore, Robin can fill 4 bags of 10 kg each with the 35 kg of rice available.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pebbles in one hand and 13 pebbles in the other hand. If he throws all the pebbles from his right hand into the basket, then he will have 0 pebbles left in his right hand. Similarly, if he throws all the pebbles from his left hand into the basket, then he will also have 0 pebbles left in his left hand. Therefore, the number of pebbles Robin has left after throwing them all into the basket is equal to the total number of pebbles he had initially minus the number of pebbles he threw into the basket. So, we can write the equation as follows: Number of pebbles Robin has left = Initial number of pebbles - Number of pebbles thrown into the basket Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Initial number of pebbles = 28 + 13 = 41 Total number of pebbles thrown into the basket = 4 (since there are 4 viponds) Therefore, we can solve for the number of pebbles Robin has left: Number of pebbles Robin has left = 41 - 4 = 37 So, Robin has 37 pebbles left after throwing them all into the basket.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 paks of rice and he needs to distribute them equally among 45 people. So each person will get 0.47 paks (21/45). Now we have 9 baskets left after distributing the rice. Each basket contains 0.47 paks, so the total number of paks in each basket is 0.47 x 9 = 4.33 paks. Therefore, Robin has 4.33 paks of rice left after distributing it among all the people.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pebbles in one hand and 14 pebbles in the other hand. Therefore, he has a total of 42 pebbles. Now, we are told that there are 6 viponds per kilo. So, if Robin has 42 pebbles, then he also has 42/6 = 7 viponds.

"Response:  We are given that in every 5 days, there is a payment of Kshs 165. To find out how much money is paid per day, we divide the total amount paid (Kshs 165) by the number of days (5). So, the daily payment is:

Kshs 165 / 5 = Kshs 33
Therefore, Kshs 33 is paid per day."
Response:  We are given that there are 144 stages in total and we have completed 22 stages so far. To find out how much money is left, we can use the formula: Total amount of money - Amount already spent = Remaining amount. In this case, the total amount of money is 144 x 100 = 14400. So, if we have spent 22 stages, the remaining amount would be 14400 - 220 = 14180. Therefore, the amount of money left is 14180.
Response:  The total amount of money that was spent in 30 days is given as D = 420. From this amount, 22 shillings were spent every day. To find out how much was spent by Kurusha Peter, we need to divide the total amount by the number of days he spent it. So, the answer is: K = 420 / 30 = 14 per day. Therefore, Kurusha Peter spent 14 x 22 = 296 shillings in one month.
Response:  We are given that there were 382 people who did not attend the meeting in January and 374 people who attended the meeting in June. So, we need to find out how many people did not attend both meetings. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who attended one of the meetings from the total number of people who did not attend either meeting. Therefore, the difference between 382 and 374 is equal to the number of people who did not attend both meetings. Hence, the answer is 9 (382 - 374).
"Response:  We are given that in every 5 days, there are 120 customers who come for treatment and in every 3 days, there are 66 customers who come for treatment. So, to find out how many customers come for treatment in one day, we can divide the number of customers who come in 5 days by 5. Therefore, the number of customers who come for treatment in one day is; 120/5 = 24."
Response:  We are given that in 154 days, 325 goals were scored and in 114 days, 114 goals were scored. To find out how many goals were scored per day on average, we divide the total number of goals by the number of days. So, the average number of goals scored per day is: (325 + 114) / 258 = 1.26 goals/day. Therefore, the answer is 1.26 goals/day.
Response:  We have 10 biscuits and 4 cookies. If we give 2 biscuits to each of the 5 people, how many will be left for us? So, the number of biscuits left after sharing is 10 - (2 x 5) = 10 - 10 = 0. Therefore, there are no biscuits left after sharing.
Response:  We have four biscuits (pakiti), each with 5 pieces (zuri). Therefore, we have a total of 20 pieces of biscuits (pakiti). For the peanuts (keki), we have 22 pieces. And for the chocolates (chokoleti), we have 16 pieces. So, the total number of items is: 20 + 22 + 16 = 58.
Response:  We are given that there were 23 baskets of beans and 27 bags of flour. To find out how many bags of flour each basket of beans could hold, we need to divide the number of bags by the number of baskets. So, if each basket of beans could hold ⅔ bag of flour, then we can calculate the total number of bags of flour as follows: Number of bags = Total number of baskets x Amount per basket = 23 x ⅔ = 15.7 bags of flour Therefore, there were approximately 16 bags of flour in total.
Response:  We are given that Lucy has 3 baskets of beans and she wants to share them equally among her friends. So, each friend will get 2 baskets of beans. Now, there are 12 friends in total, so Lucy will have 1 basket left after sharing with all her friends. Therefore, the answer is 12 (baskets of beans remaining with Lucy).
Response:  We have 12 people in total and each person has brought 4 items of food. Therefore, we have a total of 12 x 4 = 48 items of food. Since there are more than 36 people, some of them must be sharing their food with others. So, the number of people who have extra food is equal to the difference between the total number of people and 36. In this case, that difference is 9 (36 - 12). Therefore, there are 9 people who have extra food.
Response:  We have 8 people initially and then we add 5 more people to make it 13 in total. So far so good. Then we subtract 3 people from the initial group of 8, leaving us with 5 people remaining. Therefore, there are 5 people left in the group after all the calculations.

Response:  The number of students in the program is given as 676. To find out how many teachers are needed to teach this number of students, we can use the following formula: Number of teachers = Total number of students / Minimum number of students per teacher. In this case, let's assume that the minimum number of students per teacher is 20 (which is a reasonable assumption). Now, we can plug in the values and solve for the number of teachers: Number of teachers = 676 / 20 = 33.8 So, there would be approximately 34 teachers in the program.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 73 teachers, 724 students, and 744 parents involved in this program. So, the total number of people involved is 73 + 724 + 744 = 1501. Therefore, the answer is 1501.
"Response:  The number of students in class 174 is given as 521. To find out how many teachers are needed to supervise these students, we need to divide the total number of students by the maximum capacity of each teacher. So, if one teacher can handle up to 60 students (as suggested in the problem), then we will need:

521 students / 60 students per teacher = 8.7 teachers
So, there would be approximately 9 teachers needed to supervise the 521 students in Class 174."
Response:  The number of students in the program is given as 177 and the number of graduates is 44. Therefore, the number of students who did not complete the program is 133 (177 - 44).
Response:  The number of people who will be traveling to Japan is 919 and they will be returning after 1307 days (or approximately 35 years). Therefore, the number of trips made during this period would be 919 / 1307 = 0.68 or approximately 68 trips.
"Response:  We are given that ""Pango hilo lina kina cha futi 1218 na tayari wako kwenye futi 849"". This means that there are 1218 pieces of pango (sticks) in a certain line, and we need to find out how many more sticks there are than those needed for a line with 849 pieces. So, the difference between the two numbers is 369 (1218 - 849). Therefore, the answer is 369."
"Response:  We are given that ""tayari"" has 659 letters and ""pango"" has 762 letters. To find out how many letters are in common between them, we need to subtract the number of letters in ""tayari"" from the number of letters in ""pango"". So, the difference is: 762 - 659 = 83. Therefore, there are 83 letters that are common between ""tayari"" and ""pango""."
Response:  We are given that there were 8 fish in total and Paige caught 4 of them. So, the number of fish left after Paige caught 4 is 8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 fish left in the water after Paige caught 4.
Response:  The number of fish in the lake is 7 plus 12 which gives us 19. Since there are 15 people who want to catch fish, we subtract 15 from 19 giving us 4. So, only 4 fish will be left for everyone to share equally among themselves.
Response:  We are given that there are 16 fish in the first group and 71 fish in the second group. Also, we know that 50% of the fish in the second group prefer to swim with the school. So, the number of fish that will be left alone is 71 - (50/100) x 71 = 35.9. Therefore, approximately 36 fish will be left alone.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 fish in total and 5 of them are liked by Paige. So, the number of fish that Paige likes is 5/15 = 0.33 or 33%.
Response:  We are given that there were 50 people who took part in the race and 43 of them finished the race. So, we can say that 43/50 = x, where x is the number of people who did not finish the race. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We are given that Mkokoteni had 58 cows and after selling some of them, he was left with 35. So, we can say that Mkokoteni sold 23 cows (58 - 35 = 23).
Response:  We are given that Mkokoteni had 40 matooke and 54 maize. After cooking, he was left with 39 yams. To find out how many matooke were cooked, we can use the following formula: Number of cooked matooke = Total number of matooke - Number of uncooked matooke. In this case, the total number of matooke was 40, and the number of uncooked matooke was 39 (since some were already cooked). Therefore, the number of cooked matooke is: Number of cooked matooke = 40 - 39 = 1. So, one matooke was cooked.
Response:  We are given that there are 11 people in a room and each person has a bag with either 4 or 40 items inside. To find out how many bags of items there are altogether, we can use multiplication. So, if there are x number of bags with 4 items inside, then there will be 4x bags with 40 items inside. Therefore, the total number of bags of items is 4x + 40(11 - 4) = 4x + 440.
Response:  If Adam can make 10 things in one day and he makes 2 things per hour, then he will take 5 hours to complete 10 things (10/2=5). So, if it takes him 5 hours to do 10 things, then he will take 4 hours to do 8 things (8/2=4). Therefore, the answer is 4 hours.
"Response:  We are given that Adam can make 8 baskets in 10 minutes and he makes 4 baskets per minute. To find out how many baskets Adam will make in total, we need to multiply the number of minutes taken to complete the task by the number of baskets made per minute. Therefore, the total number of baskets made by Adam is:
Total Baskets = Number of Minutes x Number of Baskets Made Per Minute
= 10 min x 4 baskets/min
= 40 baskets
Therefore, Adam will make 40 baskets in total."
Response:  We are given that there are 544 trees in total and each tree has 10 branches. Therefore, we have 544 x 10 = 5440 branches in total. Now, out of these 5440 branches, 32 are broken. So, the remaining number of branches is 5440 - 32 = 5408 branches.
Response:  We are given that there are 466 people in total and they are divided into two groups of equal size (kuna). Therefore, the number of people in each group is half of 466, which is 233. Now we are asked how many people are in each house (maua) and how many houses have 5 or more people (fimbo). To find out how many people are in each house, we divide the total number of people by the number of houses (466 / 2 = 233). This means that each house has an average of 233/2 = 116.5 people. Finally, we are asked if any house has 5 or more people. Since 116.5 is less than 5, the answer is yes, some houses have 5 or more people. So, the correct answer is 181.
"Response:  We are given that there are 141 people in total and they have been divided into groups of 71 for one activity and 91 for another activity. So, we need to find out how many people are doing both activities. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who are only doing one activity from the total number of people. Therefore, the answer is:
Mangapi = Total number of people - Number of people doing only one activity
= 141 - (71 + 91)
= 141 - 162
= -21
So, there are 21 people who are not participating in either activity."
Response:  We are given that Kila sufuria ina maua 40 ndani yake. This means that there are 40 sufuras in total. Now we need to find out how many sufuras fit in one maua (container). According to the question, the capacity of one maua is 400. So, if we divide the number of sufuras by the capacity of one maua, we get: Number of sufuras in one maua = Total number of sufuras / Capacity of one maua = 40 / 400 = 1/10. Therefore, there are 10 sufuras in one maua.
Response:  We are given that there are 4502 Skittles in total and Steven has eaten 4276 of them. To find out how many Skittles are left for everyone else, we need to subtract the number of Skittles eaten by Steven from the total number of Skittles. So, the number of Skittles left for everyone else is: Total number of Skittles - Number of Skittles eaten by Steven = 4502 - 4276 = 224 Skittles. Therefore, there are 224 Skittles left for everyone else.
Response:  We are given that there are 3941 Skittles in total and Steven has eaten 495 of them. To find out how many Skittles each eraser can hold, we need to divide the number of Skittles left (4950) by the number of erasers (495). So, each eraser can hold approximately 10 Skittles.
Response:  We are given that there are 896 Skittles in total and Steven has eaten 517 of them. That means he still has 379 Skittles left. If we divide the remaining Skittles by 8 (the number of people), then each person will have approximately 47 Skittles (rounded to the nearest whole number). So, the answer is 47.
Response:  If there are 270 students in school and each class has 5 students per row, then we have: Number of rows = Total number of students / Number of students per row = 270/5 = 54 rows. Therefore, there are 54 rows in the school.
Response:  The number of students in each class is given as 304 and there are 75 students per class. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is:  304 x 75 = 22,550.
