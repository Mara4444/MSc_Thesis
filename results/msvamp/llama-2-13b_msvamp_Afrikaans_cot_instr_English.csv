"Response:  If Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday, we can start by finding out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, if we subtract 10 from 18, we get:

18 - 10 = 8

So, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday."
"Response:  If Julia played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday, we can start by finding out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Monday. To do this, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday. So, if she played with 11 children on Monday and 12 children on Tuesday, we have:

12 - 11 =?

This gives us the difference between the two numbers:

12 - 11 = 1

So, Julia played with one more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and with some other children on Tuesday. If she played with 15 children in total, then she must have played with more children on Tuesday than on Monday. So, we can let X be the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday. Then, we know that she played with 5 children on Monday, so we can write an equation:

5 + X = 15

Solving for X, we get:

X = 10

So, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday."
"Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Tuesday, and she played with 2 children on Monday, then we can find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Monday by subtracting 2 from 16.

So, Julia played with 16 - 2 = 14 more children on Tuesday than on Monday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children on Tuesday. So we can start by subtracting 16 from 12 to find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday:

12 - 16 = -4

Now we have found out that Julia played with 4 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday. To find out how many children she played with on Tuesday in total, we need to add the number of children she played with on Monday to the number of children she played with on Tuesday:

16 + 4 = 20

Therefore, Julia played with 20 children on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and more than 8 children on Monday. So, we can start by subtracting 8 from 14 to find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday:

14 - 8 = 6

So, Julia played with 6 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 17 children on Monday, 15 children on Tuesday, and 2 children on Wednesday. To find out how many children she played with in total, we need to add up these numbers:

17 + 15 + 2 = 34

So, Julia played with 34 children in total."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

15 + 18 = 33

So, Julia played with 33 children altogether on Monday and Tuesday."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 9 children on Tuesday. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many children she played with on Wednesday. According to the problem statement, she played with 15 children on Wednesday. Okay, now let's add up all three numbers: 5 + 9 + 15 = 29. Therefore, Julia played with 29 children in total over these three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 2 children on Monday and with x children on Tuesday (x = 14) and with y children on Wednesday (y = 16). So, we can write an equation for the total number of children she played with each day as follows:

Monday: 2 + 14 + 16 =?

Solving for the sum, we get:

2 + 14 + 16 = 32

Therefore, Julia played with 32 children in total over the three days."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 9 children on Monday (M), 7 children on Tuesday (D), and 96 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, let's do that:

M - D =?

We know that M = 9 and D = 7, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

9 - 7 =?

Solving for the missing value, we get:

2

So, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday (Maandag), 2 children on Tuesday (Dinsdag), and 8 children on Wednesday (Woensdag). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, let's do that:

14 - 8 =?

The difference is 6. Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday. So, if we subtract 9 (the number of children she played with on Wednesday) from 11 (the number of children she played with on Tuesday), we get:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday and Tuesday combined compared to Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the sum of the numbers of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday. So let's do that:

15 + 18 = 33

Now, let's subtract 7 (the number of children she played with on Wednesday):

33 - 7 = 26

So, Julia played with 26 more children on Monday and Tuesday combined than she did on Wednesday."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 13 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 13 + 10 = 23 children in two days. On Wednesday, she played with 15 children, so she has played with a total of 23 + 15 = 38 children altogether.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 7 children on Monday and 13 children on Tuesday. So far, we have:

7 + 13 = 20

Now, we are told that she played with 20 children on Wednesday. This means that all 20 children played together with Julia on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children who played with Julia is:

20

So, Julia played with a total of 20 children."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, if we subtract 18 from 19, we get:

19 - 18 =?

That gives us:

19 - 18 = 1

So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
"Response:  If Julia played with 5 children on Tuesday and 6 children on Monday, we can start by finding out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday. To do this, we need to subtract 5 from 6:

6 - 5 =?

That gives us:

6 - 5 = 1

So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 18 children in total. She played with 4 children on Monday and a few more on Tuesday. To find out how many children she played with on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the total number of children. So, if she played with 4 children on Monday, then she played with 18 - 4 = 14 children on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Wednesday and 6 children on Monday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, if we subtract 4 from 6, we get:

6 - 4 = 2

So, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Wednesday."
"Response:  If Bobby had eaten 25 pieces of candy at first and then ate another 43 pieces in total, we can calculate how many pieces he ate at the beginning as follows:

First, let's find out how much Bobby ate in total:

25 + 43 = 68

Now, we know that Bobby ate 68 pieces of candy in total. But we want to know how many pieces he ate at the beginning. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pieces he ate later (43) from the total number of pieces he ate:

68 - 43 = 25

So, Bobby ate 25 pieces of candy at the beginning."
Response:  We know that Bobby has eaten 28 pieces of candy and 63 pieces of chocolate. So he has eaten in total 28 + 63 = 91 pieces of food.
"Response:  We know that Bobby has eaten 33 pieces of candy and 14 pieces of chocolate. So we can start by adding these two numbers together to find out how many treats he has eaten in total.

33 + 14 =?

That gives us a total of... (let me count)... 47 treats!

So Bobby has eaten 47 treats in total."
Response:  We know that Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and 16 pieces of chocolate. So he has eaten a total of 38 + 16 = 54 pieces of food. Now we are asked how much more candy than chocolate he has eaten. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of pieces of chocolate from the total number of pieces of food he has eaten. In other words, we can say: 54 - 16 =.... Can you solve for the missing number?
Response:  We know that Bobby had 20 pieces of delicious food and he ate 34 pieces. So, he ate 34 - 20 = 14 pieces more than he had. Therefore, Bobby ate 14 pieces of delicious food in total.
"Response:  We know that Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 of them. So, how many pieces of candy does he have left?

We can use subtraction to find out:

21 - 5 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Bobby had 22 pieces of candy and he ate some of them. He is left with 5 pieces. So, if we subtract the number of pieces he ate from the total number of pieces he had, we can find out how many pieces he ate at the beginning.

22 - 5 =?

Can you solve for x (the number of pieces Bobby ate at the beginning)?"
"Response:  We know that Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate 2 pieces. So, if we subtract the number of pieces he ate from the total number of pieces he had, we can find out how many pieces of candy he has left.

19 - 2 = 17

So, Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left."
Response:  We know that Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them. If he ate 20 pieces of candy, then he has 32 - 20 = 12 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17, then he has 17 - 36 = 19 pieces left.
Response:  If Bobby had 30 pieces of candy and he ate 23 pieces, then he has 30 - 23 = 7 pieces of candy left.
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake, we need to subtract the number of balloons Jake brought from the number of balloons Allan brought. So, if we subtract 3 (the number of balloons Jake brought) from 5 (the number of balloons Allan brought), we get:

5 - 3 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons. To find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan, we need to subtract the number of balloons Allan brought from the number of balloons Jake brought. So, if we subtract 2 (the number of balloons Allan brought) from 3 (the number of balloons Jake brought), we get:

3 - 2 = 1

So, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park."
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balloons and there are in total 3 balloons, then Jake must have brought 1 balloon. So, Jake brought one balloon to the park.
Response:  We know that Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and Allan brought x more balloons than Jake. So, if we let x be the number of balloons Allan brought, then Jake brought 6. Therefore, in total, there were 6 + x balloons at the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake has 6 more balloons than Allan, then Jake has 5 + 6 = 11 balloons in total. So Jake brings 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons. So together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons. Then we are told that Allan bought 2 more balloons at the park, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons. Therefore, Allan had 5 balloons at the park. As for Jake, he still has 5 balloons. In total, there were 5 + 5 = 10 balloons at the park.
"Response:  We know that Jake brought 4 balloons to the park and Allan brought 2 balloons plus 3 more that he bought at the park. So we can start by comparing how many balloons each of them had before they went to the park. 
Allan had 2 balloons before going to the park, and Jake had 4 balloons before going to the park. Now let's add the number of balloons they bought at the park: 
Allan bought 3 balloons at the park, so now he has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. 
Jake did not buy any balloons at the park, so he still has only 4 balloons. Therefore, Allan had more balloons than Jake in the park. The difference is 5 - 4 = 1 more balloon for Allan."
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, Allan had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park. Jake had 6 balloons, so Jake had more balloons than Allan at the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Jake had one more balloon than Allan at the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Allan brought 5 + 3 = 8 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 2 balloons to the park. Then Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, Jake has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Therefore, Allan had more balloons than Jake in the park because 6 > 5.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. Then Jake bought 4 more balloons at the park. So, Jake had a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balloons at the park. Since Allan brought 6 balloons, Jake had one more balloon than Allan. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons Jake had and the number of balloons Allan had is 1. The numeric answer is 1.
"Response:  
Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. 
Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. 
So, Jake brought a total of 6 + 3 = 9 balloons to the park."
"Response:  We know that Allan had 3 balloons and 20 balls, so if we add these numbers together, we get:

3 + 20 = 23

So Allan brought 23 items to the park. Now let's look at what Jake brought. We know that Jake had 5 balloons and 59 balls, so if we add these numbers together, we get:

5 + 59 = 64

So Jake brought 64 items to the park. In total, there were 23 + 64 = 87 items brought to the park by both Allan and Jake."
Response:  We know that Allan had 7 balls and brought 5 to the park, so he had 7 - 5 = 2 balls left at home. Jake had 6 balls and brought 4 to the park, so he had 6 - 4 = 2 balls left at home. In total, Allan and Jake had 2 + 2 = 4 balls each at the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons and together they brought 6 balloons to the park, then Jake must have brought 1 balloon to the park.
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons to the park and bought 3 more there, so he had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park. Now we need to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan. To do this, we can subtract the number of balloons Allan had from the number of balloons Jake brought: 
Jake brought 6 balloons to the park, but Allan only had 5, so Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how much more time he spends on English compared to Chinese, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on Chinese from the amount of time he spends on English. Here's the calculation:

6 hours (English) - 2 hours (Chinese) = 4 hours

So, Ryan spends 4 hours more on English than on Chinese each day."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how much more time he spends on Chinese than on English, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on English from the amount of time he spends on Chinese. So, if we subtract 6 hours (the number of hours he spends on English) from 7 hours (the number of hours he spends on Chinese), we get:

7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more on Chinese than on English each day."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and another couple of hours learning Chinese. So, if he spends 4 hours in total learning both languages, we can deduce that he spends half of his study time (i.e., 2 hours) learning Chinese.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and some more hours studying Chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on English than on Chinese, we can start by finding out how many hours he spends on Chinese.

Let X be the number of hours Ryan spends on Chinese. Since he also spends 7 hours on English, we have:

X + 7 = Total hours spent per day

We are given that Ryan spends 2 hours more on English than on Chinese, so we can write:

X + 7 = English hours + 2

Now we need to solve for X. Can you do it?"
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and another couple of hours learning English. If he spends 2 more hours on English than on Chinese, we can let X represent the number of hours he spends on English. Then, we have the following equation:

X + 2 = 5 (since he spends 5 hours on Chinese)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 3

So, Ryan spends 3 hours more on English than on Chinese."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. So, if we multiply these two numbers together, we get:

6 hours/day x 7 days = 42 hours

So, Ryan spends a total of 42 hours per week learning both languages."
Response:  We know that Ryan spent 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many hours he spent in total on English learning for two days, we need to multiply the number of hours he spent each day by 2. So, for two days, Ryan spent 6 x 2 = 12 hours learning English.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many hours he has spent learning Chinese altogether, we need to multiply the number of days he has been learning by the number of hours he spends per day on Chinese. So if he has been learning for 6 days (which is what the problem states), then he has spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours learning Chinese.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 4 hours per day on English and 6 hours per day on Chinese. So, if we add up these two numbers, we get:

4 + 6 = 10

So, Ryan spends 10 hours per day learning languages!"
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. That means he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day learning those two languages. He also spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish. So, if we add up all the time he spends learning these three languages, we get:

13 (English) + 7 (Chinese) + 3 (Spanish) = 23 hours per day

Therefore, Ryan spends 23 hours per day learning these three languages."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and Chinese each. So, he spends 6 x 2 = 12 hours per day on these two languages combined. He also spends 58 hours per week on Spanish. Therefore, the difference between the time spent on English and Chinese is:

12 (English + Chinese) - 58 (Spanish) = 12 - 58 = -46 hours

So, Ryan spends 46 fewer hours on Chinese than on English."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying languages. He spends 2 hours per day studying Chinese and 4 hours per day studying Spanish. To find out how much more time he spends on English compared to Spanish, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on Spanish from the total amount of time he spends on all three languages. So, if we let E be the number of hours Ryan spends on English, C be the number of hours he spends on Chinese, and S be the number of hours he spends on Spanish, we can set up the following equation based on the information given in the problem:
E + C + S = 7 (1)
We also know that E + C = 2 (2)
and E + S = 4 (3)
Now, we can solve for E using equations (1) and (2):
E + C + S = 7
E + C = 2
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:
S = 5
So, Ryan spends 5 hours more on English than he does on Spanish."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and Spanish. He spends 2 hours per day learning English. So, he has 5 - 2 = 3 hours left for other activities. Now, we need to find out how much more time he spends on learning Chinese compared to Spanish. To do this, we can subtract the time spent on Spanish from the total available time: 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends one more hour on learning Chinese than on learning Spanish.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese combined. Since he spends 2 hours per day learning English, he must spend 1 hour per day learning Chinese (3 - 2 = 1).
Response:  We know that Ryan learns English and Chinese for 7 days, and he spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many hours he spends in total learning both languages, we need to multiply the number of days he learns each language by the number of hours he spends per day learning that language. So, for English: 7 days x 4 hours/day = 28 hours And for Chinese: 7 days x 5 hours/day = 35 hours In total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages.
"Response:  We know that Tiffany had 8 sacks of potatoes on Monday and found 7 more sacks the next day. To find out how many more sacks she had on Monday than what she found the next day, we need to subtract the number of sacks she found the next day from the number of sacks she had on Monday. So, if we do this, we get:

8 (Monday) - 7 (next day) =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 7 bags of chips on Monday and found 12 more bags the next day. So, she found 12 - 7 = 5 more bags of chips on Tuesday than she had on Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany had 4 sakkies (blikkies) on Monday and found another pair on Tuesday, that means she had a total of 4 + 2 = 6 sakkies on Tuesday. So, if she found more sakkies on Wednesday, she would have had a total of 6 + x sakkies, where x is the number of sakkies she found on Wednesday.
Response:  If Tiffany had 2 packets of biscuits on Monday and found 4 more packets on Tuesday, then she had a total of 2 + 4 = 6 packets of biscuits on Tuesday. So, on Monday, she had 2 packets of biscuits.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 10 packets of biscuits on Monday and found 3 packets the next day. So, she had 10 - 3 = 7 packets of biscuits on Tuesday. Then, on Wednesday, she found 7 more packets, so she had 7 + 7 = 14 packets of biscuits in total.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 8 sacks of potatoes on Monday and found 10 sacks the next day. That means she found 2 more sacks than she already had. So, if she had 8 sacks, then she found 8 + 2 = 10 sacks. Then, the day after that, she found 4 more sacks. So, in total, she found 10 + 4 = 14 sacks of potatoes. Therefore, Tiffany found 14 sacks of potatoes after Monday.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 3 packets of biscuits on Monday and then she found 7 more packets on Tuesday. So, if we add 3 + 7 = 10 packets of biscuits on Tuesday. Then, she also found 44 bottles. Now, let's calculate how many packets of biscuits Tiffany had in total. To do this, we need to divide the number of bottles she found (44) by the number of biscuits in each packet (8). 44 / 8 = 5 packets of biscuits. Therefore, Tiffany had a total of 10 + 5 = 15 packets of biscuits.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 rooi perskes and 16 groen perskes in the basket. To find out how many more rooi perskes than groen perskes, we need to subtract the number of groen perskes from the number of rooi perskes. So, if we subtract 16 (the number of groen perskes) from 17 (the number of rooi perskes), we get:

17 - 16 =?

Can you solve for the difference?"
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of green apples. So, if we subtract 5 from 11, we get:

11 - 5 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are ten red persimmons and ""nog 'n paar"" (meaning a few) green persimmons in the basket. If we add up all the persimmons, we get:

10 (red) + X (green) = 15 (total)

where X is the number of green persimmons. Since we don't know exactly how many green persimmons there are, we can use the word ""paar"" to indicate that there are only a few. So, let's assume that there are two more green persimmons.

10 (red) + 2 (green) = 15 (total)

Therefore, there are 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are three red apples and a few green apples in the basket. If there are ten more green apples than red apples, we can find out how many green apples there are by subtracting three from ten. Ten minus three equals seven. So, there are seven more green apples in the basket. In total, there are three + seven = ten green apples in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red perske (rooi), 15 yellow perske (geel) and 8 green perske (groen). So we can start by adding up all these numbers to get the total number of perske in the mandjie:

7 + 15 + 8 =?

Can you solve this addition problem and tell me the total number of perske in the mandjie?"
Response:  We know that there are 7 rooi perske (red apples), 71 geel perske (yellow apples) and 8 groen perske (green apples) in the basket. To find out how many more green apples than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. Total number of apples = 7 + 71 + 8 = 96 So, there are 96 apples in the basket. Now, let's subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 96 - 7 = 96 - 7 = 89 Therefore, there are 89 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 red apples, 6 yellow apples and 14 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples than yellow apples, we need to subtract the number of yellow apples from the total number of green apples. So, if we have 14 green apples, and we subtract 6 (the number of yellow apples), we get:

14 - 6 = 8

So, there are 8 more green apples than yellow apples in the basket!"
"Response:  We know that there are 19 rooi perske and 11 geel perske in the basket. To find out how many more rooi perske than geel perske, we need to subtract the number of geel perske from the number of rooi perske. So, if we do this, we get:

19 - 11 = 8

So, there are 8 more rooi perske than geel perske in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 rooi perske (red apples), 90 geel perske (yellow apples) and 16 groen perske (green apples). To find out how many red and green apples there are in the basket, we can start by finding their total number of apples first. So, if we add 6 + 90 + 16 = 122 apples. Now, to find out how many red apples there are, we divide the total number of apples by 6 (the number of red apples): 122 / 6 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 red apples in the basket. Similarly, to find out how many green apples there are, we divide the total number of apples by 16 (the number of green apples): 122 / 16 = 7.5. Since we cannot have half an apple, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 8 green apples in the basket. So, there are 20 red apples and 8 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 rooi perske, 14 geel perske and 17 groen perske in the basket. To find out how many rooi and geel perske there are, we can add the number of rooi and geel perske together. So, if we add 18 + 14 = 32, we get 32. Therefore, there are 32 rooi and geel perske in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples (rooi), 14 yellow apples (geel) and 6 green apples (groen). To find out how many yellow and green apples there are together, we can add 14 + 6 = 20. So, there are 20 yellow and green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that each manji has 7 red peppers and 3 green peppers. So if we multiply 7 by 65 (the number of manjis), we get 495 red peppers. And if we multiply 3 by 65, we get 195 green peppers. In total, there are 495 + 195 = 690 peppers in each manji.
Response:  We know that each manji has 10 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So if we multiply the number of manjis (11) by the total number of peppers per manji (10 + 18 = 28), we get a total of 318 peppers.
"Response:  We know that each manji has 16 red peppers and 18 green peppers. So if we have 6 manjis, we can multiply the number of red peppers by 6 to get the total number of red peppers:

6 x 16 = 96

There are 96 red peppers in the 6 manjis."
Response:  We know that each manji has 10 red persimmons and 2 green persimmons. So if we have 7 manjis, we will have 7 x 10 = 70 red persimmons in total. And we also have 7 x 2 = 14 green persimmons in total. Therefore, there are 14 green persimmons in all the manjis.
"Response:  We know that each manji has 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons. So if there are altogether 7 persimmons, we can start by finding out how many red persimmons there are.

We know that each manji has 4 red persimmons, so:

4 x number of manjis = 7 (red persimmons)

Now, we need to find out how many green persimmons there are. Since each manji has 3 green persimmons, we can calculate as follows:

3 x number of manjis = 7 (green persimmons)

Now we have two equations:

4x + 3y = 7... (1)

where x is the number of manjis and y is the number of green persimmons.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7/4 = 1

So there is one manji with 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons.

Therefore, the answer is 1 manji."
Response:  We know that each manji has 4 red persimmons and a few green persimmons. If there are altogether 12 persimmons in all the manjis, then each manji must have 12/4 = 3 green persimmons. So, there are 3 green persimmons in each manji.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 chickens in total and 13 of them are red. That means there are 3 chickens left who are not red. Since we also know that there are a ""few"" green chickens among the non-red ones, let's assume that all three non-red chickens are green (we don't know exactly how many). Therefore, the number of green chickens in the coop is 3."
"Response:  We know that each manji has 19 red persimmons and 4 green persimmons. If there are 15 manjis, we can multiply the number of red persimmons by 15 to get the total number of red persimmons:

19 x 15 = 285

So, there are 285 red persimmons in total. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of green persimmons by multiplying 4 by 15:

4 x 15 = 60

Therefore, there are 285 red persimmons and 60 green persimmons in the 15 manjis."
"Response:  We know that each manji has 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons. So if there are 10 manjis, we can multiply the number of red persimmons by 10 to get the total number of red persimmons:

4 x 10 = 40

And we can do the same for the green persimmons:

6 x 10 = 60

So there are 40 red persimmons and 60 green persimmons in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 green perskes, 60 yellow perskes and 2 red perskes in the basket. To find out how many more green perskes than red perskes, we need to subtract the number of red perskes from the total number of perskes. So, let's do that:

60 (yellow) + 6 (green) = 66

Now, let's subtract the number of red perskes from the total number of perskes:

66 - 2 (red) = 64

Therefore, there are 64 perskes in the basket, and 6 (green) - 2 (red) = 4 more green perskes than red perskes."
Response:  If Jerry had four action figures on his shelf initially and then added a few more, we can start by finding out how many action figures he had altogether. We know that there were four initial action figures, so let's add four to the total number of action figures. Then, we can find out how many action figures Jerry added later. To do this, we need to subtract the original number of action figures (four) from the total number of action figures. Finally, we divide the difference by two to get the average number of action figures Jerry added per day. Here's the calculation: Total number of action figures = 4 + x (where x is the number of additional action figures) Number of initial action figures = 4 Subtracting the initial number of action figures from the total number of action figures gives us: Total number of action figures - 4 = x x = (Total number of action figures - 4) / 2 Average number of action figures added per day = (Total number of action figures - 4) / 2 Therefore, the average number of action figures Jerry added per day is: Average number of action figures added per day = (Total number of action figures - 4) / 2 = (8 - 4) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 So, Jerry added an average of two action figures per day.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had a few action figures on his shelf initially (we don't know exactly how many). Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf later. So, if we add the initial number of action figures to the ones he added later, we get:

Initially, Jerry had x action figures on his shelf + 7 = Total number of action figures on the shelf Now, we know that there are 10 action figures on the shelf in total. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 7 = 10
Solving for x, we get:

x = 3
So, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is:

4 (initial) + 6 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 action figures on Jerry's shelf."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, we can start by comparing the number of action figures with the number of books:

Number of action figures = 5 + 7 = 12

Number of books = 9

Now, let's compare the total number of action figures with the total number of books:

Total number of action figures = 12
Total number of books = 9

So, there were 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures now is 2 + 4 = 6. Now, we need to find out how many more books than action figures were on the shelf originally. To do this, we subtract the number of action figures from the original number of books. So, we subtract 6 (the new total number of action figures) from 10 (the original number of books): 10 - 6 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf originally.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf is:

8 (action figures) + 9 (books) = 17

Therefore, there were 17 items in Jerry's shelf."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, we can start by finding out how many more action figures than books were there on the shelf. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books from the total number of items (action figures + books). 

Total items = 7 (action figures) + 2 (books) = 9

Subtracting the number of books from the total items gives us:

9 - 2 = 7

So, there were 7 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Then he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf now is 5 + 2 = 7 (action figures) + 9 = 16 (books). Therefore, there are 16 - 5 = 11 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  We know that Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf initially and then he added 4 more toys later. So, if we add 8 + 4 = 12 action figures were there on his shelf at one point of time. However, he removed 5 old ones from the shelf, so the total number of action figures left is 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, there were 7 action figures on Jerry's shelf at any given time.
Response:  If Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf and then added 4 more, that means he has a total of 7 action figures on the shelf (3 + 4 = 7). Now, if he removed 2 old ones, there would be 5 action figures left on the shelf (7 - 2 = 5). So, Jerry has removed 2 action figures from the shelf.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially and then added a few more later. He removed ten of the old ones, leaving eight action figures on the shelf. So, if he added ""a few"" more after starting with 7, we can assume that he added 3 or fewer new action figures (since he already had 7). Now, let's count how many new figures he added:

1. Jerry added 3 new action figures.
2. He also removed 10 old ones.

So, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is:

3 (new) + 8 (old) = 11

Therefore, Jerry has 11 action figures on his shelf now."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had a few action figures on his shelf initially (a ""couple"" means more than one but less than five). Then he added two more action figures to the shelf and removed seven of the old ones. So if we let x be the number of action figures Jerry had at first, we can write an equation based on what we know:

x + 2 = 10 (since there are now ten action figures on the shelf)

We also know that Jerry removed seven of the old action figures, so we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 2 - 7 = 10 - 7

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

x + 2 - 7 = 3

Solving for x:

x = 5 (since 5 + 2 - 7 = 3)

So Jerry had five action figures on his shelf initially."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf and later added 7 more. So, he has a total of 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on his shelf now. Now, we are told that he also has 10 books on his shelf. To find out how many more action figures than books he has, we can subtract the number of books from the total number of action figures: 16 - 10 = 6. Therefore, Jerry has 6 more action figures than books on his shelf.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf. If he added two more action figures to the shelf, we can calculate how many more action figures there were than books. 
Firstly, let's count the number of action figures: 3 + 2 = 5 action figures. 
Now, let's count the number of books: 3. 
So, there are 5 action figures and 3 books on Jerry's shelf. To find out how many more action figures there are than books, subtract the number of books from the number of action figures: 5 - 3 = 2. 
Therefore, there are 2 more action figures on Jerry's shelf than books."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf initially. Then he added two more action figures to the shelf. So, if we subtract the number of books from the total number of items on the shelf (books + action figures), we can find out how many more action figures there were than books. Here's the calculation:

Total items = 7 (books) + 3 (action figures) + 2 (additional action figures)
= 10 + 2
= 12

So, there were 12 items on Jerry's shelf in total - 7 books and 5 action figures. Therefore, there were 5 more action figures than books."
Response:  If there are already 2 birds sitting on the fence and 2 more have joined them, then there must be at least 4 birds on the fence in total (2 + 2 = 4). This means that there are still 2 more birds to come (6 - 4 = 2) to complete the group of 6 birds on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 4 birds on the branch (the ""beginning"" of the heining). Then, 2 more birds joined them (on the ""heining""). So, in total, there were 4 + 2 = 6 birds on the heining."
Response:  We know that there are already 46 ooievaars sitting on the fence and then 6 more birds join them. So in total, we have 46 + 6 = 52 birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are three birds and two storks on the fence. If five more birds join them, we need to find out how many birds and storks will be on the fence in total.

To solve this problem, we can use addition. Three + five = eight birds will be on the fence. Two storks plus eight birds equals ten animals on the fence. Therefore, there will be ten animals (two storks and eight birds) on the fence after five more birds join the ones already there."
"Response:  We know that there are three birds (voëls) and four owls (ooievaars) sitting on the fence. Two more birds have joined them. So, in total, we have:
3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that there are two owls and three vultures sitting on the fence. So, if we add two plus three, we get five birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are five more vultures sitting on the fence than owls.
Response:  We know that there are four birds (ooievaars) sitting on the fence and two more have joined them. So in total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 ooievaars sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are three birds (voels) and four owls (ooievaars) sitting on the fence. Additionally, seven more owls have joined them. To find out how many birds and owls are sitting on the fence in total, we need to add the number of birds and owls together. Three + four = seven, so there are seven birds and owls sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 6 vols (doves) and 3 ooievaars (oo-ee-vahrs) sitting on the fence. If two more ooievaars join them, we can add 2 to the number of ooievaars. So, in total, there will be 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are four birds (voels) sitting on the fence and three crows (ooievaars) sitting next to them. If three more crows join them, we need to find out how many birds in total will be sitting on the fence.

To do this, we can use addition. The number of birds already sitting on the fence is four (the voels), and if three more crows join them, the total number of birds sitting on the fence will be:

4 + 3 = 7

So, seven birds in total will be sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there are four vultures and eight storks on the heath. If we add the number of vultures to the number of storks, we get:
4 + 8 = 12
So, in total, there are 12 birds sitting on the heath."
"Response:  We know that there are already two birds sitting on the fence (2). Then, five more birds joined them (5), and four storks also sat nearby (4). In total, how many birds are now sitting on the fence?  
To find out, we need to add the number of birds that have joined the original two: 2 + 5 = 7. So, there are seven birds sitting on the fence in total."
Response:  We know that there are three birds sitting on the fence (voëls) and two more birds will join them (ooievaars). So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are three owls sitting on the branch (ooievaar), and four other birds have joined them (by hulle aangesluit). So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the branch.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 ooievaars and 2 voëls on the heining (in total, 8 birds). Three more voëls have joined them, so we can add 3 to the number of voëls. Now, let's compare the number of ooievaars to the number of voëls: 6 (ooievaars) vs. 5 (voëls). There are more ooievaars than voëls, so the difference between the two numbers is:

6 - 5 = 1

Therefore, there is one more ooievaar than voël on the heining."
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence and 2 more birds have joined them. So, in total, there are 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, we need to find out how many more ooievaars are sitting on the fence than voels. To do this, we can subtract the number of voels from the total number of birds on the fence: 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more ooievaars than voels sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, if we do this, we get:

48 - 11 = 37

So, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So, let's do that:

80 - 37 =?

The difference between the two chapters is... 43 pages!"
Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in total and the first chapter has 60 pages. So we can find out how many pages are left for the second chapter by subtracting 60 from 93: 93 - 60 = 33. Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
"Response:  We know that there are 67 pages in total and the second chapter has 36 pages. So we can find out how many pages the first chapter has by subtracting 36 from 67. First, let's write down the equation:

67 - 36 =?

Now, solve for the unknown quantity (in this case, the number of pages in the first chapter):

67 - 36 = 31

Therefore, the first chapter has 31 pages."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages and the third chapter has 24 pages. To find out how many pages the book has in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, we can write an equation:

66 + 35 + 24 =?

Solving for the unknown (?) gives us:

66 + 35 + 24 = 125

Therefore, the book has 125 pages in total."
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 91 pages, and we want to find out how many more pages it has compared to the second chapter. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So let's start with the first chapter: 91 pages. Now, what is the number of pages in the second chapter? Ah yes, it has 23 pages. Okay, so now we can subtract: 91 - 23 =? That gives us our answer! The first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter.
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 35 pages, the second chapter has x pages (where x is the number of pages in the third chapter), and the third chapter has y pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract y from x. So our equation would be:
x - y =?
We are also given that the total number of pages in all three chapters is 3 + 18 + 3 = 24 pages. Therefore, we can set up another equation using this information:
3 + 18 + 3 = 24
Now solve for x in the first equation:
x - y = 24
Subtracting y from both sides gives us:
x - y = 24
x = 27
So the second chapter has 27 pages. Now let's calculate the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the number of pages in the third chapter:
27 - 3 = 24
Therefore, the second chapter has 24 more pages than the third chapter."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 53 pages, the second chapter has 75 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So let's do that:

53 - 21 =?

The difference between the two numbers is:

53 - 21 = 32

So the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter!"
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. So we can start by multiplying 31 x 61 = 1931 pages.
"Response:  We know that there are 23 pages in total and the first chapter has 10 pages. So we can find out how many pages are in the second chapter by subtracting the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages: 
23 - 10 = 13 
Therefore, there are 13 pages in the second chapter."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 pages in total and the second chapter has 68 pages. So we can find out how many pages are in the second chapter by subtracting the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages:

81 - 68 =?

Do you want to try to solve this problem yourself before I give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that 62 campers went rowing in the morning and 39 campers went rowing in the afternoon. To find out how many more campers went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. So, if we subtract 62 from 39, we get:

62 - 39 =?

The difference is 23. Therefore, there were 23 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning."
"Response:  We know that 52 people went rowing in the morning and 61 people went to the beach in the afternoon. To find out how many more people went to the beach in the afternoon than went rowing in the morning, we need to subtract the number of people who went rowing in the morning from the number of people who went to the beach in the afternoon. So, if we subtract 52 from 61, we get:

61 - 52 = 9

Therefore, there were 9 more people who went to the beach in the afternoon than went rowing in the morning."
"Response:  We know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning and some more campers will go rowing in the afternoon. So, if we add 15 + x (where x is the number of campers who will go rowing in the afternoon), we get the total number of campers who will go rowing that day.

x + 15 = 32

Solving for x, we get:

x = 17

So, 17 campers will go rowing in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that some campers went swimming in the morning and 7 campers went swimming in the afternoon. So, if we add the number of campers who went swimming in the morning and the number of campers who went swimming in the afternoon, we can find out how many campers went swimming overall.

Let x be the number of campers who went swimming in the morning. Then, 7 + x = 60 (since 7 campers went swimming in the afternoon).

Solving for x, we get:
x = 53

So, there were 53 campers who went swimming overall."
"Response:  We know that 36 campers went out in the morning, and 13 campers went out in the afternoon. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

36 + 13 = 49

Therefore, there were 49 campers who went out in total."
"Response:  We know that 39 people had lunch and 31 people had dinner. So, if we subtract 39 from 31, we get: 
31 - 39 =? 
The difference is: 8. Therefore, there were 8 more people who had supper than had lunch."
"Response:  We know that there were 53 campers who went out in the morning, and 49 campers who went out in the afternoon. To find out how many more campers went out in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went out in the afternoon from the number of campers who went out in the morning. So, if we subtract 49 from 53, we get:

53 - 49 = 4

So, there were 4 more campers who went out in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that 34 people had breakfast in the morning and 10 people had lunch in the afternoon. To find out how many more people had lunch than breakfast, we need to subtract the number of people who had breakfast from the number of people who had lunch. So, if we subtract 34 (morning) from 10 (afternoon), we get:

10 - 34 = -24

So, there were 24 fewer people who had lunch than had breakfast."
"Response:  We know that 
13 + 21 = 34 campers go rowing."
Response:  We know that 29 campers went rowing and 66 campers went hiking in the morning. That means there were 29 + 66 = 95 campers who did something in the morning. In the afternoon, 26 campers went swimming. So, we can say that 95 - 26 = 70 more campers swam in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 41 campers go rowing and 4 campers go hiking in the morning. That means 37 campers are left for the afternoon activities. Of those, 26 campers engage in afternoon activities. So, in total, 41 + 26 = 67 campers participate in either rowing or hiking.
"Response:  We know that 43 campers went rowing in the morning and some campers went rowing in the afternoon. So we can start by subtracting the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers to find out how many campers were left for the afternoon activity.

Total number of campers = 46
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 43

Subtracting the two numbers gives us:

46 - 43 = 3

So there were 3 campers left for the afternoon activity. Now we need to find out how many of these campers went rowing in the afternoon. The information given is ""a few"" campers went rowing in the afternoon. Let's assume that half of the remaining campers (i.e., 1.5) went rowing in the afternoon.

1.5 x 3 = 4.5

Therefore, approximately 4.5 campers went rowing in the afternoon."
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples on the tree, then there are 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree.
"Response:  If Rachel had 4 apples at first and she picked a few, then she must have picked some of them. So, if she started with 4 apples and picked some, then she has less than 4 apples now. How many apples did she pick? Well, we know that there are still 2 apples left on the tree, so let's use subtraction to find out how many apples Rachel picked.

4 (starting number) - 2 (number left on the tree) =? (number picked)

Solution:

4 - 2 = 2

So, Rachel picked 2 apples!"
"Response:  If Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from the tree and there are still 5 apples left on the tree, then we can start by subtracting 7 (the number of ripe apples) from 5 (the total number of apples remaining):

5 - 7 =?

Do you know the answer?"
Response:  If there were initially 2 ripe apples on the tree and now there are 7 apples in total (including the 2 that Rachel picked), then we can deduce that 5 more apples have ripened since Rachel plucked the first two. Therefore, the number of ripe apples on the tree at the beginning was 2 + 5 = 7.
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree and there were two ripe apples left on the tree. So, if we subtract the number of ripe apples Rachel picked (6) from the total number of ripe apples on the tree (2), we get:

2 - 6 = -4

This means that there were four more unripe apples on the tree than ripe apples!"
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree and there were 2 ripe apples left on the tree after she picked them. So, if we subtract the number of ripe apples Rachel picked (3) from the total number of ripe apples on the tree (2), we get:

2 - 3 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and then two new ones grew in their place. So, if we subtract the number of apples she picked (7) from the total number of apples on the tree before she started picking them, we can find out how many apples were originally on the tree.

Total number of apples = Number of apples after Rachel finished picking + Number of new apples grown
= 6 + 2
= 8

So, there were 8 apples on the tree to start with."
Response:  If Rachel had 2 apples before and she picked 4 more from the tree, then she has a total of 2 + 4 = 6 apples now. But wait, there are also three new apples that have grown on the tree! So, in total, there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rachel had 52 apple bombs and she picked 2 apples from one of her bombs. So, if we subtract 2 from 52, we get 50. Therefore, there were 50 apples in the bomb to begin with.
"Response:  We know that each tree had 8 apples picked from it, so if we subtract 8 from the total number of apples on each tree, we can find out how many apples were left on each tree. 

Tree 1: 9 - 8 = 1 apple left
Tree 2: 9 - 8 = 1 apple left
Tree 3: 9 - 8 = 1 apple left

So, there were initially 3 x 1 = 3 apples on all three trees combined."
Response:  We know that each tree has 7 apples and Rachel picked 7 apples from each tree. So she picked a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. But we are also given that there are still 29 apples left on the trees. Therefore, the total number of apples Rachel has is 28 + 29 = 57 apples.
"Response:  We know that Ed has 2 more marbles than Doug, so if Ed has x marbles, then Doug has x-2 marbles. Now we are told that Doug lost some of his marbles on the playground and now he has 19 fewer marbles than Ed. So, if Doug had x marbles before losing them, then after losing some of them, he would have x - 19 marbles. 
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x - (x-2) = 19
Solving for x, we get:
2x = 38 + 19
2x = 57
x = 28
So, Doug lost 28 marbles on the playground."
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug had x marbles, then Ed had x + 10 marbles. Now we know that Doug lost 11 marbles on the playground, so he has x - 11 marbles left. How many marbles does Ed have now? Well, if Doug has x - 11 marbles, and Ed had x + 10 marbles, then Ed has x + 10 - 11 = x + 9 marbles! Therefore, Ed has 9 more marbles than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed had x marbles, then Doug would have had x - 6 marbles. Now we are told that Doug lost 7 marbles on the playground. Therefore, the number of marbles Doug has now is:

x - 7

We also know that Ed had 22 marbles in total. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

x = 22 + 6

Substituting the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation gives us:

(22 + 6) - 7 =?

Simplifying and solving for x gives us:

38 - 7 = 31

Therefore, Doug has 31 marbles left after losing 7 on the playground."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug initially. So if Doug had x marbles, Ed would have had x + 5 marbles. Now we are told that Doug lost 3 marbles on the playground, so after losing those marbles, Doug has x - 3 marbles left. Since Ed still has his original number of marbles (x + 5), we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Ed has x + 5 marbles
Doug has x - 3 marbles

Now we need to find out how many marbles Doug had at first. To do this, we can subtract Ed's marbles from both sides of the equation:

x + 5 = x - 3

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 8

x = 4

So Doug had 4 marbles at first."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. If Doug had x marbles, then Ed would have had x + 24 marbles. 
We also know that Doug lost 27 marbles on the playground. So, after losing those marbles, Doug has x - 27 marbles left. 
Now we can set up an equation to represent this situation:
x - 27 = (x + 24)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 51
So, Doug had 51 marbles before he lost them all on the playground. Ed had 51 + 24 = 75 marbles in total."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. If Doug had x marbles, then Ed had x + 29 marbles. Now we are told that Ed lost 17 of his marbles on the playground. So, after losing 17 marbles, Ed has x + 29 - 17 =? marbles left. Simplifying, we get: 
x + 29 - 17 =? 
To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had after losing 17 marbles: 
x + 29 - 17 =? 
Subtracting 17 from both sides gives us: 
x + 29 - 17 = x + 12 
Now we can see that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, the answer is: 
Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, so if Doug had x marbles, Ed had x + 19 marbles. Now it says that Ed lost a few of his marbles on the playground, and now he has 8 more marbles than Doug. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 19) - 8 =?

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 19 - 8 =?

Solving for x:

2x + 11 =?

Subtracting 11 from both sides:

2x =?

Dividing both sides by 2:

x =?

So, Ed lost 3 marbles on the playground."
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so if Doug had x marbles, then Ed had x + 30 marbles. We also know that Ed lost 21 marbles on the playground, so after losing those marbles, Ed has x + 30 - 21 =? marbles left. To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had after losing 21 marbles:? - x. So our equation is:? - x + 30 - 21 =?. Solving for?, we get:? = x + 30 - 21 = 49. Therefore, Ed had 49 more marbles than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed had x marbles, then Doug would have had x - 12 marbles. 
We also know that Ed lost 20 marbles on the playground. So after losing 20 marbles, Ed would have had x - 20 marbles left. 
Now we need to find out how many marbles Doug had before Ed lost his marbles. To do this, we can set up an equation based on what we know: 
x - (12) = Doug's marbles 
Solving for Doug's marbles, we get: 
Doug's marbles = x - 12 
Now we are given that Ed had 17 marbles left after losing 20. So we can substitute this value into the equation above: 
17 = x - 12 
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us: 
17 = x 
So Doug had 17 marbles before Ed lost his marbles."
"Response:  We have 408 students who preferred apple puree and 42 students who preferred bacon by the side dish. To find out how much more students preferred apple puree than those who preferred bacon, we can subtract the number of students who preferred bacon from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 408 + 42 = 450

Number of students who preferred apple puree = 408

Number of students who preferred bacon = 42

Now, let's subtract the number of students who preferred bacon from the total number of students to get the difference:

Difference = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred bacon
= 450 - 42
= 408

So, there are 408 more students who preferred apple puree than those who preferred bacon."
Response:  We have two options: aartappelpuree and spek. If we consider the number of students who preferred each option, we can say that 479 students preferred aartappelpuree, while 489 students preferred spek. Therefore, there are 10 more students who preferred spek than those who preferred aartappelpuree.
"Response:  We know that there are 185 students who have suggested adding apple puree to the menu, and we also know that some other students have suggested adding bacon to the menu (spek in Afrikaans). So, if we subtract the number of students who suggested adding apple puree from the total number of students, we can find out how many students suggested adding bacon.

Total number of students = 310
Number of students who suggested adding apple puree = 185

Subtracting 185 from 310 gives us:

310 - 185 = 125

Therefore, 125 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  We know that there were 288 students in total, and 264 of them suggested specific dishes for the menu. That means 288 - 264 = 24 students did not suggest any dish. Of those who did suggest dishes, 137 suggested meat dishes (spek) and 127 suggested vegetarian dishes (aartappelpuree). Therefore, 127 students suggested aartappelpuree as their preferred dish.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 457 students who suggested adding apple puree to the menu, while others suggested adding bacon or other ingredients. Of those who suggested adding bacon, 63 more students made this suggestion than those who suggested adding apple puree. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these facts:

Let x be the number of students who suggested adding bacon (since 63 more students suggested adding bacon than added apple puree)

Then, let y be the number of students who suggested adding apple puree (since 457 students suggested adding apple puree in total).

We know that the total number of students who suggested any ingredient is 63 + y.

Now we have three equations:

1. x + y = 63 (since 63 more students suggested adding bacon than adding apple puree)
2. x + y = 457 (since 457 students suggested adding apple puree in total)
3. x + y + 63 = 63 + y (since the total number of students who suggested any ingredient is 63 + y)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 29
y = 428

So, there were 29 students who suggested adding bacon, and 428 students who suggested adding apple puree."
"Response:  We know that there were 182 students who proposed to add apple puree to the menu, and 166 students who proposed to add bacon. To find out how many more students proposed to add bacon than those who proposed to add apple puree, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed to add apple puree from the number of students who proposed to add bacon. So, if we subtract 182 (students who proposed to add apple puree) from 166 (students who proposed to add bacon), we get:

166 - 182 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We have 324 students who suggested apple puree, 374 students who suggested bacon by the slice, and 128 students who suggested tomatoes by the plate. To find out how many students participated in each of these suggestions, we need to divide the number of students who made each suggestion by the total number of students.

So, for apple puree:

324 / 500 = 0.648 (or 64.8%)

For bacon by the slice:

374 / 500 = 0.748 (or 74.8%)

For tomatoes by the plate:

128 / 500 = 0.256 (or 25.6%)

Therefore, approximately 64.8% of the students suggested apple puree, 74.8% suggested bacon by the slice, and 25.6% suggested tomatoes by the plate."
"Response:  We have three options for the number of students who preferred each dish:

Option A: Apple puree (257 students)
Option B: Beef (120 students)
Option C: Eggplant (97 students)

We want to compare the number of students who preferred apple puree with the number of students who preferred beef and eggplant combined. To do this, we can add the number of students who preferred beef and eggplant together and then subtract that total from the number of students who preferred apple puree.

So, let's calculate:

(120 + 97) = 217

Subtracting 217 from 257 gives us:

257 - 217 = 40

Therefore, there were 40 more students who preferred apple puree than the combined total of students who preferred beef and eggplant."
"Response:  We have three options for the side dish: apple puree, bacon, and tomatoes. Each student has proposed a different number of servings for each option. To compare the numbers, we need to convert all the proposals to the same unit, such as the number of servings per person.
Let's assume there are x students in total (x = 144 + 467 + 79 = 680). Then, the total number of servings proposed for each option can be calculated as follows:
Apple puree: 144 students x 2 servings/student = 288 servings
Bacon: 467 students x 1 serving/student = 467 servings
Tomatoes: 79 students x 3 servings/student = 237 servings
Now, let's calculate the ratio of the number of servings proposed for each option to the total number of servings:
Apple puree: 288 / 680 = 0.42 (or 42%)
Bacon: 467 / 680 = 0.68 (or 68%)
Tomatoes: 237 / 680 = 0.35 (or 35%)
So, based on the proposals, more students preferred bacon (68%) than any other option, followed by apple puree (42%), and then tomatoes (35%)."
"Response:  We have 228 students who want to add apple puree to their meal, and 337 students who want to add bacon to their meal. Additionally, we have 23 students who want to add tomatoes to their meal. To find out how many more students want bacon than those who want tomatoes, we can subtract the number of students who want tomatoes from the number of students who want bacon:

337 - 23 = 314

So, there are 314 more students who want bacon than those who want tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there were 450 students in total who submitted proposals for new dishes. Of those, 38 students proposed adding apple puree to their dishes, and the rest (412) proposed adding bacon to their dishes. So, if we subtract the number of students who proposed adding apple puree from the total number of students, we get:

412 - 38 = 374

Therefore, 374 students did not propose adding apple puree to their dishes."
"Response:  We have 218 students who prefer puree and 351 students who prefer only meat (speck). So, if we add both groups together, we get:

218 + 351 = 569

Therefore, there are 569 students in total who prefer either puree or meat (speck) for their sandwich."
"Response:  We know that there are 269 students in total and 330 students have suggested apple puree by the spy card, while 76 students have suggested tomatoes by the side. To find out how many more students have suggested apple puree compared to those who have suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who have suggested bacon from the total number of students. So, the difference is:

269 - 76 = 193

Therefore, 193 more students have suggested apple puree than those who have suggested bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls. So, if we subtract 236 from 569, we get:

569 - 236 =?

Can you solve for the difference?"
"Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys at the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys. So, if we subtract 34 from 841, we get: 

841 - 34 =? 

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that there are 485 learners in total and 232 of them are girls. So, we can start by subtracting the number of girls from the total to find out how many boys there are:

485 - 232 =?

Can you solve for the remaining number of boys?"
"Response:  We know that there are 697 students in total and 228 more girls than boys. So if we subtract the number of girls from the total, we get the number of boys.

697 - 228 =?

Solving for the unknown variable (in this case, ""x""), we get:

697 - 228 = x

x = 469

Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total and 510 more boys than girls. So if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we can find out how many boys there are.

Total Students = 635
Girls =? (Let's assume it's x)
Boys = Total Students - Girls
= 635 - x

Now we know that there are 510 more boys than girls, so we can add 510 to the number of boys:

Boys + 510 = Total Students - Girls + 510
= 635 - x + 510
= 635 - x + 510

Simplify the equation:

x + 510 = 635

Solve for x:

x = 124

So there are 124 girls in the school.

And now we can calculate the number of boys:

Boys = Total Students - Girls
= 635 - 124
= 511

Therefore, there are 511 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and 281 more girls than boys. So we can start by finding out how many boys there are in the school. If there are 281 more girls than boys, then the number of boys must be less than or equal to 281 fewer than the number of girls. Can you use this information to find out how many boys there are in the school?
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 142 more boys than girls, we can find out how many boys there are by subtracting 142 from 700. So, if there are 700 girls, then there would be 700 - 142 = 558 boys. Therefore, there are a total of 700 + 558 = 1258 students in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys at school already. If 418 more girls join the school, we need to add this number to the existing number of girls. So, the total number of girls now in the school would be:

706 + 418 = 1124

Therefore, there are 1124 girls in the school now."
"Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys at school already. If 44 more girls join the school, we need to add 44 to both numbers. So, the new total number of girls will be:

902 + 44 = 946

And the new total number of students (boys + girls) will be:

811 + 946 = 1757

Therefore, there are now 1757 students in the school, including 946 girls."
"Response:  We know that there are 632 boys and 410 girls in school already. If 465 more girls join the school, we need to find out how many more girls than boys will be joining the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students (boys + girls) who have joined the school. 
Total number of students = 632 + 410 = 1042
Number of boys = 632
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys = 1042 - 632 = 410
Therefore, there will be 410 more girls than boys joining the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys at school initially. If 682 girls and 8 boys have joined the school, we need to find out how many girls are left in the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of girls who have joined from the total number of girls at school. So, the number of girls left in the school would be: 
732 - 682 = 50 girls. 
Therefore, there are 50 girls left in the school after 682 girls and 8 boys have joined."
"Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys at the school. If 496 girls and 910 boys have joined the school, we can find out how many boys are currently attending the school by subtracting the number of girls who have joined from the total number of boys. So, the number of boys currently attending the school would be: 

910 - 135 = 775

Therefore, there are 775 boys currently attending the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. To find out how many learners there are in total, we can add the number of girls to the number of boys. So, the total number of learners would be:

308 + 318 = 626

Therefore, there are 626 learners in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys at the school. To find out how many people are at the school in total, we need to add the number of girls and boys together. So, if we add 315 and 309, we get:

315 + 309 = 624

So, there are 624 people at the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 402 more girls than boys in the school and we also know that there are 739 students altogether. So if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we can find out how many boys there are. Here's the calculation: 
739 - 402 =? 
Can you solve for x (the number of boys)?"
"Response:  We know that there are 458 more girls than boys and we also know that there are 692 students in total. So if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, we can find out how many girls there are.

Let's do this:

Total students = 692
Boys =? (we don't know yet)
Girls = Total Students - Boys

Now let's use the information given to us: ""There are 458 more girls than boys."" This means that if we add 458 to the number of boys, we will get the number of girls. So we can write an equation:

Girls = Boys + 458

Now we need to find out what the number of boys is. To do this, we can substitute the value of 458 into the equation above:

Girls = Boys + 458
Girls = (Boys + 458)

We want to find out what the number of boys is, so we can solve for it. To do this, we can subtract 458 from both sides of the equation:

Boys = Girls - 458

Now we have found out that the number of boys is:

Boys = 234

So now we can find out how many girls there are:

Girls = Boys + 458
Girls = 234 + 458
Girls = 692

Therefore, there are 692 girls in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in school already. If 403 more girls join the school, we need to find out how many more girls than boys will be joining the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students who have joined the school. So let's start with the total number of students who have joined the school: 362 + 257 = 619. Now, if we subtract the number of boys (362) from the total number of students, we get: 619 - 362 = 257. Therefore, there will be 257 more girls than boys joining the school.
"Response:  We know that Edward had $18 and spent $16. So if we subtract $16 from $18, we get:

$18 - $16 =?

Can you solve for the missing amount?"
Response:  We know that Edward had $13 and he spent it all. So, if he spent all of his money, then he must have spent $13. Therefore, the amount of money that Edward spent is $13.
Response:  We know that Edward had $9 before he spent some money. Then he spent $8 more, so he had $9 + $8 = $17 after spending the money. To find out how much he had before he spent any money, we can subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had: $17 - $8 = $9. So Edward had $9 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Edward had $16 before he spent it on books. He spent $92 on 92 books, so he paid $92 - $16 = $76 more than he had. Therefore, Edward had $16 + $76 = $92 before he spent it.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 to buy two books. So each book costs $6/2 = $3.
"Response:  We know that Edward had $19 and he spent $6 on books and $16 on pens. So, we can start by subtracting what he spent from what he had:

$19 - $6 = $13 (Edward had $13 before he spent any money)

Now, let's subtract what he spent on pens from what he had:

$13 - $16 = $-3 (Edward owes $3 because he spent more than he had)

So, Edward had $13 before he spent any money, and he spent $3 more than he had, leaving him with nothing."
"Response:  We know that Edward spent $ 4 on books and $ 3 on pens, so we can start by adding these two amounts together to find out how much he spent in total:

$ 4 + $ 3 = $ 7

Now we are told that Edward has $ 12 left over after buying both books and pens. So if we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had, we can find out how much he spent on each item:

$ 12 - $ 7 = $ 5

So Edward spent $ 5 on books and $ 2 on pens ($ 7 - $ 3)."
"Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he spent in total:

$16 + $8 = $24

Now we are given that he has $19 left. So we can subtract what he spent from what he has:

$19 - $24 =?

Do you see how to find out how much more Edward spent on books than on pens?"
"Response:  We know that Edward had $17 before he spent any money. Then, he received $10 from his friend, so he has now:

$17 - $10 = $7

So, Edward had $7 before he spent any money."
"Response:  We know that David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 58 push-ups. According to the problem, Zachary did 44 push-ups, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 58) = 44...(1)

Combine like terms:

2x + 58 = 44...(2)

Subtract 58 from both sides:

2x = 36...(3)

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 18...(4)

So Zachary did 18 push-ups and David did 18 + 58 = 76 push-ups together."
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did. So, if we subtract 44 (the number of push-ups David did) from 51 (the number of push-ups Zachary did), we get:

51 - 44 = 7

So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David."
"Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups and Zachary did 9 fewer push-ups than David. So if we subtract 9 from 44, we get:

44 - 9 =?

That gives us our answer of 35. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did fewer than David. So if we subtract the number of push-ups that Zachary did from the total number of push-ups done (51), we can find out how many push-ups Zachary did.

51 - 49 = 2

Therefore, Zachary did 2 push-ups less than David, so together they did:

51 + 2 = 53

So Zachary and David together did 53 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and David did 19 more than Zachary. So we can start with this equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 19

We also know that Zachary did 44 crunches. So let's add that to our equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 19 + 44

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Zachary's push-ups and David's push-ups). Can you use these equations to find out how many push-ups David did?"
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. If David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary, then David did 44 + 29 = 73 push-ups. Since David did fewer crunches than Zachary, we can say that David did 17 - x crunches, where x is the number of crunches David did. Now we have two equations:

Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches
David did 73 push-ups and x crunches

Can you solve for x to find out how many crunches David did?"
"Response:  We know that David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so if we let D be the number of push-ups David did, then Zachary did D - 17. We also know that Zachary did 14 crunches. So our equation is:
D - 17 + 14 =?
Solving for D gives us:
D = 28
So David did 28 push-ups and Zachary did 28 - 17 = 11 push-ups.
Zachary did 14 crunches."
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so we can start by writing down these numbers:

Zachary's push-ups = 35
Zachary's crunches = 3

Now, we know that David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 58 to Zachary's push-up total:

Zachary's push-ups + 58 =?

We also know that David did 87 fewer crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 87 from Zachary's crunch total:

Zachary's crunches - 87 =?

Now we have two equations:

Zachary's push-ups + 58 =?
Zachary's crunches - 87 =?

Can you solve for the missing numbers?"
"Response:  We know that David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 38 push-ups. We also know that Zachary did 58 crunches. So let's write an equation to represent this information:

x + (x + 38) = 58

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 38 = 58

Subtracting 38 from both sides:

2x = 20

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 10

So Zachary did 10 push-ups and David did 10 + 38 = 48 push-ups. To find out how many more crunches Zachary did than push-ups, we can subtract his number of push-ups from her number of crunches:

58 - 10 = 48

Therefore, Zachary did 48 more crunches than push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 39 push-ups. Now we are given that John did 13 times fewer push-ups than David. So John did (x + 39) / 13 push-ups. To find out how many push-ups David did, we can set up an equation using this information:

David did x + 39 push-ups
John did (x + 39) / 13 push-ups

We want to find out how many push-ups David did, so we need to solve for x. We can start by solving for x in the first equation:

x + 39 =?

Now we substitute the expression for John's push-ups into the equation:

x + 39 = (x + 39) / 13

Simplifying and solving for x gives us:

x + 39 = 12x + 478

Subtracting 39 from both sides gives us:

12x = 439

Dividing both sides by 12 gives us:

x = 36

So David did 36 + 39 = 75 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up an equation based on that information. Let D be the number of push-ups David did and Z be the number of push-ups Zachary did. Since David did 22 more push-ups, we can write: 
D = Z + 22  Now we are also given that John did 4 fewer push-ups than David, so we can write: J = D - 4 To find out how many push-ups John did, substitute D and Z into the second equation: 
J = (Z + 22) - 4 J = Z + 22 - 4 J = Z + 18 So to summarize: John did 18 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up an equation based on this information. Let D be the number of push-ups David did and Z be the number of push-ups Zachary did. Since David did 39 more push-ups, we can write: 
D = Z + 39  Now we are given that John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, so we can write: J = D - 9  Substituting the first equation into the second one gives us: 
J = Z + 39 - 9  Simplifying, we get: 
J = Z + 28  So Zachary did 28 more push-ups than John."
"Response:  We know that David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 30 push-ups. The problem states that David did 37 push-ups, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 37

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 30 = 37

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 7

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 3

So Zachary did 3 push-ups."
"Response:  We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups, David did x + 56 push-ups. Also, we know that the sum of their push-ups is equal to the total number of push-ups they both did together. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on these two facts:

x + (x + 56) = 56 + 56

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 56 = 112

Subtracting 56 from both sides:

2x = 56

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 28

So Zachary did 28 push-ups and David did 28 + 56 = 84 push-ups together."
"Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches. So if Zachary did x crunches, David would have done x + 17 crunches. Since Zachary did 34 push-ups, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x+17) = 34 + 40

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 17 = 74

Subtracting 17 from both sides:

2x = 57

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 28

So David did 28 crunches."
"Response:  We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer crunches. So if we subtract the number of crunches done by David from the total number of push-ups done by both, we will get the difference between the two. 

Let's start with the information given:
Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches.
David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did:

58 + 36 = 94 push-ups

Now let's find out how many crunches David did:

David did 36 fewer crunches than Zachary, so David did:

33 - 36 = 0 crunches

Therefore, David did no crunches. To summarize:

Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, while David did 94 push-ups and 0 crunches."
"Response:  We know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer crunches. So if we subtract the number of push-ups that Zachary did from the total number of push-ups done (27), we get the difference between the two:

27 - 5 = 22

Now let's find out how many more crunches Zachary did than push-ups. To do this, we need to subtract the number of push-ups he did from his total number of crunches:

17 - 5 = 12

So Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has completed 5 pages of math homework and read 2 pages of reading homework. To find out how many more pages of math homework she had compared to reading homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of math homework. So, if we subtract 2 (pages of reading homework) from 5 (pages of math homework), we get:

5 - 2 = 3

Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework."
"Response:  If Rachel has completed 3 pages of math homework and read 4 pages of reading homework, we can start by finding out how many more pages she has read compared to her math homework. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pages she did for math from the total number of pages she did for both subjects. So, if we subtract 3 (math) from 7 (total), we get:

7 - 3 = 4

So, Rachel has read 4 more pages than she did for math homework."
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and she still needs to read more pages, then she must have at least 6 pages of homework in total (5 pages to complete + however many pages she needs to read). Therefore, if she needs to complete 7 pages of homework, she will need to read an additional 2 pages (7 - 5 = 2).
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 7 pages of math homework and she has already completed 4 pages, then she has 3 pages left to finish (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  If Rachel has 8 pages of math homework and needs to complete 3 more pages, then she has 8 + 3 = 11 pages of math homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 8 pages of math homework and she has already completed 6 pages, then she needs to complete an additional 2 pages (8 - 6 = 2).
Response:  If Rachel has 10 pages of math homework and she needs to complete 3 more pages, then she has 7 pages left to finish (10 - 3 = 7). So, in total, Rachel needs to complete 7 + 3 = 10 pages of math homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 2 pages of mathematics homework (2 x 5 = 10), 3 pages of reading homework (3 x 5 = 15), and 10 pages of biology homework (10 x 5 = 50). In total, she needs to finish 75 pages of homework (10 + 15 + 50 = 75).
"Response:  We know that Rachel has completed 9 pages of math homework and read 2 pages of her reading assignment. To find out how many more pages she needs to do in math compared to her reading assignment, we need to subtract the number of pages she read from the total number of pages she had. So, if she had 96 pages of biology homework, we can calculate it like this:

96 - 2 = 94

So, Rachel needs to complete 94 more pages of math homework than her reading assignment."
Response:  We know that Rachel has completed 11 pages of mathematics homework and read 2 pages of her mathematics homework. Therefore, she still needs to complete 9 pages (11 - 2 = 9) of mathematics homework. As for biology homework, we are given that she has done 3 pages. So, if she had more biology homework than mathematics homework, it would mean that she did not have enough time to finish all of her biology homework. However, since she only finished 3 pages of biology homework, it is likely that she had less biology homework than mathematics homework. Therefore, we can say that Rachel had at least 6 more pages of mathematics homework than biology homework (9 - 3 = 6).
"Response:  We know that Rachel has completed 7 pages of mathematics homework and read 11 pages of her literature book. To find out how many more pages she had in biology homework, we need to subtract the number of pages she read from the total number of pages she had. So, if she had 8 pages of biology homework, we can calculate it like this:

Total pages = 7 (mathematics) + 11 (literature) + 8 (biology)
= 7 + 11 + 8
= 26 pages

Therefore, Rachel had 26 pages of homework in total, including all three subjects."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading homework. To find out how many pages she needs to finish in each subject, we can subtract the number of pages she has already completed from the total number of pages. For math, she has completed 9/11 pages (90%), so she still needs to do 2/11 pages (18%). For reading, she has completed 11/29 pages (38%), so she still needs to do 18/29 pages (62%). Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 18 pages of math homework and 62 pages of reading homework.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and she has already finished 7 pages. So, she needs to finish 1 more page of mathematics homework.

Now, let's consider the biology homework. She has to complete 3 more pages of biology homework.

So, in total, Rachel needs to complete 1 page of mathematics homework and 3 pages of biology homework."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of math homework and she has already finished 10 pages of reading homework. So, she still needs to finish 5 pages of math homework (5 - 10 = 5). Additionally, she needs to complete 6 pages of biology homework, so in total, she needs to finish 11 pages of homework (5 + 6 = 11).
"Response:  We know that Rachel has done 2 pages of reading homework and 4 pages of mathematics homework. To find out how many more pages of mathematics homework she had to do, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of mathematics homework. So, if we subtract 2 (reading homework) from 4 (mathematics homework), we get:

4 - 2 = 2

Therefore, Rachel had 2 more pages of mathematics homework than reading homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has done 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of mathematics homework. To find out how many more pages of mathematics homework she would have had if she had only done the reading homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of mathematics homework. So, we can say:

7 pages of math - 4 pages of reading =?

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 4 from 7:

7 - 4 =?

This gives us:

3

So, if Rachel had only done the reading homework, she would have had 3 more pages of mathematics homework."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we let X be the number of emails Jack received in the morning, then we can write an equation based on this information:

X = 6 + 2 (since he received 2 emails in the afternoon)

Simplifying the equation:

X = 8

So, Jack received 8 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, which means he received 6 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the afternoon. So, if we subtract 6 from 8, we get:

8 - 6 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than in the morning."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and a few more in the afternoon. So, if he receives 5 emails per day, how many emails did he receive in the afternoon?

To find out, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the morning (4) from the total number of emails he received per day (5):

5 - 4 = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and then he received 3 more emails in the afternoon. So, if we add 6 + 3 = 9 emails. Therefore, Jack receives 9 emails per day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

5 + 8 = 13

So, Jack received 13 emails in the morning and afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, if we add 4 + 5 = 9 emails in total. Now, we also know that he received 8 emails in the evening. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received in the day is 9 + 8 = 17 emails.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, if we add 3 + 8 = 11 emails. Therefore, Jack received 11 emails in total for the day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 7 emails in the morning and 17 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 17 from 7, we get:

7 - 17 = -10

So, Jack received 10 fewer emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 7 from 10, we get:

10 - 7 = 3

So, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 4 from 5, we get:

5 - 4 = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 more email in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received three emails in the morning and a few more in the afternoon. So, if we add 3 + X (where X is the number of emails he received in the afternoon), we get the total number of emails Jack received in the day.

X = Total number of emails received in the afternoon

We are given that Jack receives 10 emails per day, so we can set up an equation as follows:

3 + X = 10

Solving for X, we get:

X = 7

Therefore, Jack received 7 emails in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters yesterday. Today, he received 5 emails and 54 letters. To find out how many emails Jack receives per day, we need to subtract the number of emails he received today from the total number of emails he received yesterday. So, if we subtract 3 (yesterday) from 5 (today), we get: 
5 - 3 = 2 Therefore, Jack receives 2 emails per day."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters this morning, so together they make:

5 + 6 = 11

Now we are told that he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon, so together they make:

9 + 7 = 16

In total, Jack received:

11 + 16 = 27

So, Jack receives 27 messages per day (emails and letters combined)."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters this morning (a total of 22 messages). He then received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon (for a total of 47 messages). To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, let's do that: 

10 - 3 = 7

So, Jack received 7 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters this morning (a total of 14 communications). He also received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon (for a total of 9 communications). To find out how many letters Jack received in the morning compared to the afternoon, we can subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the total number of letters he received in the morning: 8 - 7 = 1. So Jack received one more letter in the morning than in the afternoon. As for emails, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than in the morning: 6 - 2 = 4. Therefore, Jack received four more emails in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 8 emails per day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 emails in the morning, so he received 4 - 2 = 2 emails more than he sent. In the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 emails, so he received 6 + 2 = 8 emails more than he sent. Therefore, Jack sent 2 + 8 = 10 emails per day.
Response:  We know that Jack receives a total of 9 emails per day, and he gets 7 emails in the morning. So, if we subtract 7 from 9, we get 2. Therefore, Jack receives 2 emails in the afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 3 from 5, we get:

5 - 3 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 6 emails in the afternoon. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

3 + 6 = 9

Therefore, Jack received 9 emails in total for the day."
Response:  We know that the sprinkler has jumped 9 inches and the pad has jumped 12 inches. To find out how many more inches the pad has jumped than the sprinkler, we need to subtract the distance the sprinkler has jumped from the distance the pad has jumped. So, we can say that the pad has jumped 12 - 9 = 3 more inches than the sprinkler.
"Response:  We know that both the sprinkler and the pad have sprung (jumped) a certain distance. The sprinkler has jumped 31 inches, and the pad has jumped 35 inches. To find out how far they have jumped in total, we can add their distances together. So, the total distance they have jumped is:

31 + 35 = 66 inches"
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by each animal is given in inches. The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 36 inches (3 x 12 = 36). The distance traveled by the pad is 17 inches more than the sprinkler, so the distance traveled by the pad is:

17 = 36 + x

where x is the distance traveled by the mouse. Since the distance traveled by the mouse is 15 inches less than the distance traveled by the pad, we can write:

x = 17 - 15

x = 2

So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 2 inches."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the sprinkler is 25 inches, and the distance traveled by the pad is 18 inches more than the sprinkler. So, the distance traveled by the pad is:

Pad distance = Sprinkler distance + 18 inches
= 25 inches + 18 inches
= 43 inches

Now we need to find out how far the mouse has traveled. We know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 2 inches less than the distance traveled by the pad. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is:

Mouse distance = Pad distance - 2 inches
= 43 inches - 2 inches
= 41 inches

Therefore, the mouse has traveled 41 inches."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by each animal is given in inches. The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 19 inches, and it has been mentioned that the mouse has traveled 20 inches further than the sprinkler. So we can start by finding out how far the sprinkler has traveled first.

We know that the distance traveled by the paddle is 10 inches more than the sprinkler, so we can calculate the distance traveled by the paddle as follows:

Distance traveled by paddle = Distance traveled by sprinkler + 10 inches
= 19 inches + 10 inches
= 29 inches

Now we know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 20 inches more than the paddle, so we can calculate the distance traveled by the mouse as follows:

Distance traveled by mouse = Distance traveled by paddle + 20 inches
= 29 inches + 20 inches
= 49 inches

Therefore, the mouse has traveled 49 inches farther than the sprinkler."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 94 - 39 = 55 inches more than the distance traveled by the paddle. The distance traveled by the sprinkler is 19 inches. So, we can set up an equation based on these facts:

Let x be the distance traveled by the paddle.
Then, the distance traveled by the mouse is x + 55.
The total distance traveled by all three objects is 19 + x + (x + 55) = 38 + 2x + 55.
We want to find out how far the paddle has traveled, so we can set up an equation with only one variable. In this case, we will use x as our variable.

So, the equation becomes:

38 + 2x + 55 = 19 + x + 55

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

38 + 2x + 55 = 38 + 2(19) + 55
= 38 + 38 + 55
= 131

On the right side of the equation, we have:

19 + x + 55 = 19 + 19 + 55
= 43 + x

Now, we can substitute the expression for the left side into the right side of the equation:

43 + x = 131

Subtracting 43 from both sides gives us:

x = 88

Therefore, the paddle has traveled 88 inches."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the sprinkler is 25 inches, and the distance traveled by the pad is 32 inches more than the sprinkler. So, the distance traveled by the pad is:

Pad = Sprinkler + 32 inches
= 25 inches + 32 inches
= 57 inches

Now we know that the mouse has traveled 26 inches less than the pad. So, the distance traveled by the mouse is:

Mouse = Pad - 26 inches
= 57 inches - 26 inches
= 31 inches

Therefore, the mouse has traveled 31 inches."
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the mouse is 5 less than the distance traveled by the panda, and the distance traveled by the panda is 33 inches more than the distance traveled by the sprinkler. So we can set up an equation based on these facts:

Mouse distance = Panda distance - 5
Panda distance = Sprinkler distance + 33

Now we need to find out how far the sprinkler has traveled. The question tells us that the sprinkler has traveled 24 inches. So we can substitute this value into one of the equations:

Mouse distance = Panda distance - 5
Mouse distance = (Sprinkler distance + 33) - 5

Substituting 24 for Sprinkler distance, we get:

Mouse distance = (24 + 33) - 5
Mouse distance = 57 - 5
Mouse distance = 52

Therefore, the mouse has traveled 52 inches further than the sprinkler."
Response:  We know that the sprinkler has jumped 13 inches (2 x 6.5). Now we need to find out how far the pad has jumped. Since the sprinkler has jumped 2 inches further than the sprinkler, the pad must have jumped 13 - 2 = 11 inches.
"Response:  We know that the distance traveled by the sprinkler is 35 inches and it has moved 4 inches further than the sprinkler. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the distance traveled by the sprinkler.
Since the sprinkler has moved 4 inches further, the total distance traveled by both the sprinkler and the pad is:
x + 4

We know that the distance traveled by the sprinkler alone is 35 inches, so we can substitute this value into our equation:

x + 4 = 35

Now solve for x:

x = 31 (since 35 - 4 = 31)

So the sprinkler has traveled 31 inches."
"Response:  We know that the distance between the mouse and the pad is 44 cm less than the distance between the spring and the pad. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Distance between mouse and pad = Distance between spring and pad - 44 cm

We also know that the distance between the spring and the pad is 19 cm. So we can substitute this value into our equation:

Distance between mouse and pad = 19 cm - 44 cm

Simplifying the equation:

Distance between mouse and pad = -25 cm

Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the pad is 25 cm (or negative 25 cm)."
"Response:  We know that the distance between the mouse and the pad is 12 inches less than the distance between the spring and the pad. So if the distance between the spring and the pad is x inches, then the distance between the mouse and the pad is x - 12 inches. Now we are given that the distance between the spring and the pad is 39 inches, so we can set up an equation:

x = 39 + (x - 12)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 51

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25.5

So the distance between the mouse and the pad is 25.5 - 12 = 13.5 inches."
Response:  We know that the distance between the mouse and the pad is 16 inches (muis - padda = 16). The distance between the pad and the spring is 25 inches (padda - spring = 25), so the total distance traveled by the spring is 25 + 16 = 41 inches. Therefore, the spring has traveled 41 inches.
"Response:  We know that the paddle has sprung 39 inches and the sprinkler has sprung 17 inches. To find out how far the paddle has sprung compared to the sprinkler, we need to subtract the distance the sprinkler has sprung from the distance the paddle has sprung. So, if we subtract 17 inches from 39 inches, we get:

39 - 17 = 22 inches

So, the paddle has sprung 22 inches further than the sprinkler."
Response:  We know that the mouse has jumped 3 less than the number of inches that the pad has jumped. So if the pad has jumped 9 inches, then the mouse has jumped 9 - 3 = 6 inches.
"Response:  We know that the mouse has jumped 16 inches less than the frog, and the frog has jumped 37 inches further than the sprinkler. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - (Frog's jump x 0.37)

Now we need to find out what the frog's jump is. The problem states that the sprinkler has jumped 14 inches, so we can use that as our starting point:

Frog's jump = Sprinkler's jump + (Sprinkler's jump x 0.37)
= 14 in + (14 in x 0.37)
= 14 in + 5.28 in
= 19.28 in

Now we have both equations, one for the mouse's jump and one for the frog's jump. To solve for the mouse's jump, we can substitute the value of the frog's jump into the first equation:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - (Frog's jump x 0.37)
= 19.28 in - (19.28 in x 0.37)
= 19.28 in - 7.21 in
= 12 in

So the mouse has jumped 12 inches further than the sprinkler."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and she needs to add more flour than sugar. So we can start by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added (5 cups) from the total amount of flour required (14 cups). This gives us:

14 - 5 = 9 cups of flour left to add

Now, let's look at the amount of sugar required. We know that Mary needs to add 6 cups of sugar. So, if she adds 9 cups of flour, she will have added too much flour. To avoid this, she should add less than 9 cups of flour. In fact, she should add exactly half of the remaining flour, which is:

9 / 2 = 4 cups of flour

Therefore, Mary should add 4 cups of flour to make the recipe balance."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour and she needs to add more flour and sugar according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. So, if we subtract the amount of flour she has already added (4 cups), we get:

9 cups - 4 cups = 5 cups of flour left to add

Now, let's calculate how much sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe (11 cups) by the number of cups of flour she still needs to add (5 cups):

11 cups / 5 cups = 2.2 cups of sugar to add

So, Mary should add 2.2 cups more sugar than the amount of flour she has already added."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour (she says ""alreeds 'n paar koppies meel ingegooi""), so she needs to add more flour and sugar to make the total amount of each ingredient equal to what the recipe calls for.

We can start by finding out how much flour and sugar she still needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour and sugar she has already added from the total amount called for in the recipe.

Let's use the information given in the problem to find out how much flour and sugar she has already added:

* Flour: She has already added ""alreeds 'n paar koppies meel"" (a few cups of flour). Since there are 6 cups of flour called for in the recipe, she must have added at least 2 or 3 cups of flour (since ""alreeds 'n paar"" means ""already several""). So let's assume she has added 3 cups of flour.
* Sugar: The recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, but we don't know how much sugar she has already added.

Now, let's subtract the amount of flour and sugar she has already added from the total amount called for in the recipe:

Flour: 6 cups - 3 cups = 3 cups (she still needs to add 3 cups of flour)
Sugar: 13 cups -? cups = 13 cups (we don't know how much sugar she has already added)

Since Mary still needs to add 3 cups of flour and an unknown amount of sugar, her final answer would be:

Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and [insert amount of sugar she has already added] cups of sugar to make the total amount of each ingredient equal to what the recipe calls for."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour (she has ""alreeds 'n paar koppies meel ingegooi"" which means she has already added a few cups of flour). So, if she needs 11 cups of flour and she has already added some, we need to find out how much more flour she still needs to add.

Let's assume that she has added x cups of flour already, where x is the number of cups she has already added. Then, the amount of flour she still needs to add can be calculated as follows:

11 - x = The number of cups of flour she still needs to add

We are also given that she has 7 cups of sugar left, so we can calculate the total amount of flour and sugar she will need as follows:

Total flour = 11 - x + x = 11 + x
Total sugar = 7

Now, we need to determine what value of x will make the above equation true. To do this, we can substitute x = 2, since ""a few"" typically means 2-3, and see if the equation balances:

Total flour = 11 + 2 = 13
Total sugar = 7

This looks good! So, based on the information provided, Mary has 2 cups of flour left and she needs to add 2 more cups of flour to make the full recipe."
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 cups of sugar and ""a few"" cups of flour (which we can assume is 2-3 cups). If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour, she needs to add 6 more cups of flour to make the full amount required by the recipe. So, the total number of cups of flour needed for the recipe is 6 + 3 = 9 cups."
Response:  If Mary has already added a few cups of flour and needs 2 more cups to make 12 cups total, then she has used up 10 cups of flour (2 cups + a few). So, she still has 2 cups of flour left (12 - 10 = 2).
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can subtract what she has already added from the total amount needed for the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, so if we subtract 3 cups (what she has already added) from 9 cups, we get:

9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups

So, Mary still needs to add 6 cups of flour to her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. So she still needs to add 2 more cups of sugar (since the recipe calls for 14 cups) and 4 more cups of flour (since the recipe calls for 5 cups). Therefore, Mary should add 2 cups of sugar and 4 cups of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour and she needs to add 12 - 11 = 1 cup more. So, she still needs to add one cup of flour.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and needs to add more flour than sugar. So we can start by subtracting the amount of sugar (2 cups) from the total amount of flour she needs (10 cups). This gives us:

10 - 2 = 8 cups of flour left to add

Since she has already added 7 cups, we need to add an additional:

8 - 7 = 1 cup of flour

Therefore, Mary should add 1 cup of flour more than the amount of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (meal) and she needs to add more flour than sugar. So we can start by subtracting the amount of flour she already added from the total amount of flour required in the recipe. Total flour required = 12 cups - 2 cups = 10 cups. Now, let's compare the amount of sugar with the amount of flour she needs to add. Sugar required = 14 cups. Since there is more sugar than flour, she needs to add more flour. Therefore, she needs to add 10 cups - 7 cups = 3 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cups of flour (meal) and she needs to add more sugar and salt. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, so she still needs to add 1 cup of flour (6 - 5 = 1). Since there are 8 cups of sugar called for in the recipe and she has already added 5 cups, she needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar (8 - 5 = 3). Finally, since there are 7 cups of salt called for in the recipe and she has not added any yet, she needs to add all 7 cups of salt. So, Mary should add 1 cup of flour, 3 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt to complete the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary needs to add sugar to make 13 cups of sugar (the recipe calls for 12 cups and she has already added 2 cups). So we need to find out how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount needed:

13 - 2 = 11

So Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the recipe, so she needs to add more flour than sugar. To find out how much more flour she needs, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount of flour in the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar, so if we subtract 4 cups (the amount of sugar she has already added) from 9 cups, we get:

9 cups - 4 cups = 5 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour to the recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (meal) and needs to add more flour so that she has the same amount of flour as sugar. If she has 2 cups of flour already, and the recipe calls for 9 cups of flour in total, then she needs to add 7 cups of flour (9 - 2 = 7). So, Mary should add 7 cups of flour to make the dough.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to her recipe, so she needs to add more flour than sugar. To find out how much more flour she needs, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she has from the total number of cups of flour required in the recipe. In this case, we need to subtract 11 from 14, which gives us 3. So, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour to her recipe.

Now, let's move on to the sugar. Since there are 5 cups of sugar in the original recipe and Mary has already added 11 cups of flour (which is less than the amount of sugar), we can say that she needs to add more sugar than flour. To find out how much more sugar she needs, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she has from the total number of cups of sugar required in the recipe. In this case, we need to subtract 3 from 5, which gives us 2. So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar to her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour (meal) to the mixture and she needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So if she needs 3 cups of sugar, she will need 8 cups of flour (5 more than 3). Therefore, Mary has 8 - 2 = 6 cups of flour left to add to the mixture.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour (x) to the mixture and she needs 12 more cups of flour. If the recipe calls for 13 cups of flour in total, then we can set up the following equation:

13 - x = 12

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

So, Mary has already added one cup of flour to the mixture and she needs 12 more cups. Therefore, she has 12 + 1 = 13 cups of flour in total."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, so we can calculate as follows:

14 - 7 = 7

So, Mary still needs to add 7 cups of flour to her recipe."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and 12 cups of flour to her recipe. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she already has from the total amount called for in the recipe. In this case, we need to subtract 10 from 11 to get 1 cup of sugar left to add. So, Mary should add one more cup of sugar to her mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 cups of flour and needs to add 10 more cups of flour according to the recipe. So she still needs to add 4 cups of flour (10 - 6 = 4).
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add more flour (meal) than sugar to make the cookies. She has already added 4 cups of flour, so she needs to add 9 - 4 = 5 cups more flour. Since there are 14 cups of sugar in the recipe, we can say that for every cup of sugar, Mary should add 5 / 14 = 1/3 cup more flour. Therefore, Mary should add 14 x 1/3 = 4 2/3 cups more flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour (meal) and she needs to add more flour or sugar according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar and 7 cups of flour. Since she has already added 2 cups of flour, she needs to add 7 - 2 = 5 cups more flour. Therefore, Mary should add 5 cups more flour to make the cake.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cups of flour (meal) to her recipe, so she needs to add more sugar and salt accordingly. The original recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt. Since she has already added 12 cups of flour, she should add 6 + 9 = 15 cups of sugar and salt in total. Therefore, Mary needs to add 15 - 9 = 6 cups more of sugar to her recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and needs to add 7 - 4 = 3 more cups of sugar. So she needs to add 3 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added ten cups of sugar to her recipe, so she needs to add less than twelve cups of flour (since she started with twelve). How much less? Well, if she added ten cups of sugar and the recipe calls for twelve cups of flour, then she needs to add four cups of flour more (twelve minus ten = four). So, Mary should add four cups of flour to her recipe.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bird families living near the mountain and 60 bird families have migrated for the winter. To find out how many more birds have migrated than those who stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of birds who stayed behind from the total number of birds that migrated. So, the difference between the two numbers will give us the answer.

Let's do the calculation:

Total number of birds that migrated = 60
Number of birds who stayed behind =? (we don't know yet)

To find out the number of birds who stayed behind, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of bird families:

Total number of birds / Number of bird families =?

We know that there are 19 bird families, so let's plug in this value:

Total number of birds / 19 =?

Now solve for the unknown variable:

Total number of birds / 19 =?

The answer is:

Total number of birds / 19 = 60 / 19 = 3

So, there are 3 birds per family who stayed behind. Now, let's calculate the total number of birds who stayed behind:

3 x 19 = 57

Therefore, 57 birds stayed behind for the winter.

In summary, 60 - 57 = 3 more birds migrated for the winter compared to those who stayed behind."
Response:  If there were initially 87 bird families living near the mountain and 7 of them migrated for the winter, then there would be 80 bird families left (87 - 7 = 80). Now, if we assume that all 80 remaining bird families stayed behind during the winter, then there would be no change in the number of bird families after the winter. So, the final answer is 80.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 families of birds that migrate to warmer lands for the winter, and 14 families remain behind in the mountainous area. To find out how many bird families were originally near the mountain at the beginning of winter, we need to subtract the number of families that migrated from the total number of families. So, if we have 20 + 14 = 34 families of birds in total, and 20 families migrated, then we can calculate as follows:

34 - 20 = 14

Therefore, there were initially 14 bird families living near the mountain at the beginning of winter."
"Response:  We know that there are 85 voël families near the mountain and 23 of them migrated to Africa and 37 of them migrated to Asia. So, if we subtract the number of families that migrated to Africa (23) and Asia (37), we get:

85 - 23 - 37 =?

Solution:

85 - 23 - 37 = 25

Therefore, there are 25 voël families left near the mountain after migration."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain and 42 birds have migrated to Africa while 31 birds have migrated to Asia. To find out how many more birds have migrated to Africa than to Asia, we need to subtract the number of birds that have migrated to Asia from the total number of birds that have migrated. So, let's do that:

42 - 31 =?

The difference between the two numbers is:

42 - 31 = 11

Therefore, 11 more birds have migrated to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain and 47 birds have migrated to Africa and 94 birds have migrated to Asia. So, if we subtract the number of birds that have migrated to Africa (47) from the total number of birds living near the mountain (38), we get:

38 - 47 =?

Now, let's do the same for the birds that have migrated to Asia:

38 - 94 =?

So, the difference between the number of birds that have migrated to Africa and the number of birds that have migrated to Asia is:

? - 94 =?

Can you solve these two equations and find out how many more birds have migrated to Asia compared to Africa?"
"Response:  We know that there are 18 bird families living near the mountain and 38 birds have migrated to Africa and 80 birds have migrated to Asia. So, if we subtract the number of birds that have migrated to Africa (38) and Asia (80), we get the total number of birds that have not migrated for the winter.

Total number of birds not migrating = 18 bird families x (number of birds per family - 38 - 80)
= 18 x (unknown number) - 38 - 80
= 18 x? - 118

Now, we need to find out what the unknown number is. To do this, we can add 38 + 80 to both sides of the equation:

18 x? - 118 + 38 + 80 =?

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

18 x? = 246

Dividing both sides by 18:

? = 14

Therefore, the total number of birds that have not migrated for the winter is 14."
"Response:  If there are currently 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 18 new families have joined them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain would be:

87 + 18 = 105

So, now there are 105 bird families living near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that there are 49 voëlfamilies that stay near the mountain during winter and 24 new families have arrived from the Arctic area to live nearby. To find out how many families are left over, we need to subtract the number of families that stayed (49) from the total number of families (59). So, the difference is:

59 - 49 = 10

Therefore, 10 voëlfamilies are left over or remain near the mountain."
"Response:  If there are initially 41 bird families near the mountain and 27 of them migrate to warmer lands for the winter, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain would be:

41 - 27 = 14

So, there are 14 bird families left near the mountain after the migration."
"Response:  We know that there are 86 families of birds in total and 45 of them migrated to a nearby mountain for the winter. To find out how many more families migrated compared to those who stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of families who stayed behind (45) from the total number of families (86). So, the difference between the two numbers is:

86 - 45 = 41

Therefore, 41 more families of birds migrated for the winter compared to those who stayed behind near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families living near the mountain and 35 of them migrated to Asia while 62 of them migrated to Africa. So, we need to find out how many more birds migrated to Africa compared to those who migrated to Asia. To do this, we can subtract the number of birds who migrated to Asia from the total number of birds that migrated to both Africa and Asia.

Total number of birds that migrated = Number of birds that migrated to Africa + Number of birds that migrated to Asia
= 62 + 35
= 97

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of birds that migrated to Africa and the number of birds that migrated to Asia:

Difference = Number of birds that migrated to Africa - Number of birds that migrated to Asia
= 62 - 35
= 27

So, 27 more birds migrated to Africa than to Asia."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 voël families living near the mountain and 26 new families have arrived from the Arctic region while 2 families have migrated further south for the winter. So, if we subtract the number of families that migrated further south (2) from the total number of new families (26), we get:

26 - 2 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 voël families living near the mountain during the winter season."
Response:  If Paul had 253 colorful pots at first and lost or gave away 70 of them, then he has 183 colorful pots left at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 551 friends at the beginning of the school year and lost or gave away 374 (551 - 374 = 177). So, he has 177 friends left. To find out how many birthday gifts he received, we need to divide the number of friends he has left by the number of gifts he got. In this case, if he received 551 gifts for his birthday, then he would have received approximately 3.09 gifts per friend (177 / 551 = 0.309).
"Response:  We know that Paul had 440 colored marbles and he gave away 111 of them to his friends while losing 106. So, we can start by subtracting 106 from 440:

440 - 106 =?

The result is:

334

So, Paul has 334 colored marbles left."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 65 colorful pots at first and gave away 213 to his friends during the school year. He also lost 16 pots. So we need to find out how many pots he has left after giving them away and losing some.

Let's start with the number of pots he gave away:

213 - 16 = 197 (pots given away)

Now, let's subtract the number of pots he gave away from the original number of pots he had:

65 - 197 =? (lost or remaining pots)

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Paul had 589 colorful pots at first and he gave 161 to his friends during the school year. So, how many more pots did he give away than what he lost? To find out, we need to subtract the number of pots he lost from the total number of pots he had:

589 - 161 =?

Do you want to try solving this subtraction problem yourself before I tell you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that Paul had 110 colorful pots at first and gave 90 of them to his friends during the school year. That means he has 20 pots left (110 - 90 = 20). Now we need to find out how many more pots he lost than what he gave away. To do this, we subtract the number of pots he gave away from the total number of pots he had: 

20 - 90 = -70

So, Paul lost 70 more pots than what he gave away to his friends."
Response:  We know that Paul received 563 marbles during the school year and lost 558 of them. So, he has remaining marbles = 563 - 558 = 332 marbles. Therefore, for his birthday, he received 332 marbles.
Response:  We know that Paul had 52 balloons and gave 535 to his friends. So he has 535 - 52 = 483 balloons left. Now we need to find out how many balloons were lost or given away. To do this, we subtract the number of balloons he had from the total number of balloons he received: 483 - 492 = 10. Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 10 balloons.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 521 crickets and 66 escapees at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school year, he only had 154 crickets left while he did not lose any escapees. So we can start by subtracting the number of crickets he had at the end of the school year from the total number of crickets he had at the beginning of the school year:

521 - 154 =?

Now, let's add the number of escapees he had at the beginning of the school year to the result we just found:

521 - 154 + 66 =?

Can you solve for the missing value?"
Response:  We know that Paul had 531 colored potatoes and 38 outliers for his birthday party at the end of the school year. He did not lose any outliers. So he had 531 + 38 = 569 potatoes in total. Now we need to find out how many more crops he grew compared to the number of outliers. To do this, we subtract the number of outliers from the total number of potatoes: 569 - 38 = 531. Therefore, Paul grew 38 more crops than outliers.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 601 crickets and 406 grasshoppers at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school year, he only had 336 crickets left while he did not lose any grasshoppers. So we can start by subtracting the number of crickets he lost from his initial amount of crickets:

601 - 336 = 265

Now, let's find out how many more grasshoppers he had than crickets:

406 - 265 = 141

So, Paul had 141 more grasshoppers than crickets."
Response:  We know that Paul had 291 marbles at the end of the school year and lost or gave away 315 of them. So, he has 291 - 315 = 66 marbles left. Therefore, Paul received 66 marbles as a birthday gift.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 267 colorful pots at first and lost 231 of them during the school year while giving 308 to his friends. To find out how many more pots he gave away than he lost, we need to subtract the number of pots he lost from the number of pots he gave away. So, if we subtract 231 from 308, we get:

308 - 231 = 77

Therefore, Paul gave away 77 more pots to his friends than he lost during the school year."
Response:  We know that Paul received 457 out of 523 votes (457/523 = 87%). So, he lost 66 votes (523 - 457 = 66). Since each vote was worth one point, Paul lost 66 points.
"Response:  If the waiter had 11 customers and lost some, he must have had fewer than 11 customers after that. So let's say he had x customers before losing some. After losing some, he had 3 customers left. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x - 3 = 11 (since he had 11 customers before losing any)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8 (Since 8 minus 3 equals 11)

So the waiter had 8 customers before losing some."
"Response:  If the waiter had 3 customers and lost some, he must have had fewer than 3 customers after that. So let's say he had x customers before losing some. Then, he had x - 2 customers after losing two customers. Now, if he gained four more customers, he would have x + 4 customers in total. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 4 = (x - 2) + 2

Simplifying the equation:

x + 4 = x - 2 + 2

Solving for x:

x + 4 = 0

x = 4

So the waiter had 4 customers initially, lost 2, and then gained 4 more, making his current total of customers 6."
"Response:  We know that at first, the waiter had 9 clients and then he lost 9 clients. So, if we subtract 9 from his initial number of clients, we will get the number of clients he had initially.

So, let x be the number of clients the waiter had initially. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:

x - 9 = 12 (since he had 12 clients after losing 9)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 21 (Since 21 - 9 = 12)

Therefore, the waiter had 21 clients initially."
"Response:  If the waiter had 14 clients and 5 of them ordered coffee, then he had 14 - 5 = 9 clients who did not order coffee. So, the waiter still has 9 clients left to serve."""
"Response:  If he had 13 clients and lost some, then he has fewer than 13 clients now. He gained 4 new clients, so let's subtract the number of clients he lost from his original total to find out how many clients he currently has.

13 - x = 9 (where x is the number of clients he lost)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So, he had 9 clients left after losing 4 clients."
Response:  If he had 12 clients and lost 15, then he has 12 - 15 = 7 clients left. Now, if he gained 14 new clients, then he has 7 + 14 = 21 clients in total. So, there are 21 clients left.
"Response:  We know that the waiter had 3 customers initially and then more customers arrived. So, if we subtract the initial number of customers (3) from the total number of customers (8), we get the number of new customers who arrived:

8 - 3 = 5

Therefore, there were 5 new customers who arrived at the restaurant."
"Response:  If the waiter had 8 clients and lost some, he now has 5 left. To find out how many new clients he has, we need to subtract the number of clients he lost from his original number of clients. So, if he started with 8 clients and lost some, he now has:

8 - x (where x is the number of clients he lost)

clients left. Now, he gained 99 new clients, so the total number of clients he has now is:

8 - x + 99

To solve for x, we can add 8 and 99:

8 + 99 = 107

Now, we can substitute x with the difference between 8 and 107:

x = 107 - 8

x = 99

So, the waiter had 99 new clients in addition to the 5 clients he had left after losing some. Therefore, the total number of clients the waiter has now is:

8 - 99 + 99 = 107"
Response:  If the waiter had 12 customers and lost some, he now has 14 - 12 = 2 new customers. So, the waiter currently has 2 + 14 = 16 customers in total.
"Response:  We know that Dan paid $2 for the chocolate stick and then spent an additional $3 on something else. So, if we add $2 + $3, we get:

$2 + $3 = $5

So, Dan had $5 initially."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $ 4 on a chocolate bar and had $ 3 left after buying it. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$ 4 - $ 3 =? (the cost of the chocolate bar)

Solving for the unknown variable ($ 3), we get:

$ 4 - $ 3 = $ 1

So the chocolate bar cost $ 1."
"Response:  We know that Dan paid R3 for each chocolate bar and bought 99 of them. So we can calculate how much he spent in total as follows:

Total amount = Number of items x Price per item
= 99 x R3
= R307

Therefore, there is R307 owed."
Response:  We know that Dan paid R3 for two chocolates, so each chocolate cost R3/2 = R1.50.
"Response:  We know that Dan paid $ 2 for each chocolate bar and he bought a few of them for $ 6 in total. So we can start by setting up an equation based on this information:

$ 2 = Number of chocolate bars x Price per chocolate bar

We also know that the price per chocolate bar is $ 3, so we can substitute that into the equation:

$ 2 = Number of chocolate bars x $ 3

Now we need to solve for the number of chocolate bars. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the price per chocolate bar:

Number of chocolate bars = $ 2 / $ 3

Simplifying, we get:

Number of chocolate bars = 2 / 3

Therefore, Dan bought 2/3 of a chocolate bar. Since there are no fractions of chocolate bars, we can round down to the nearest whole number. This means that Dan bought 2 chocolate bars."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $ 7 in total. He bought a nice treat for $ 2 and some chocolate for $ 3. So we can write an equation to represent this information:

$ 7 = $ 2 + $ 3

Solving for the unknown variable ($ 2), we get:

$ 2 = $ 7 - $ 3

Simplifying, we get:

$ 2 = $ 4

So Dan spent $ 4 on the nice treat."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $ 4 on a chocolate bar and $ 6 on another candy. So we can start by adding these two amounts together to find out how much he spent in total:

$ 4 + $ 6 = $ 10

So Dan spent $ 10 in total."
Response:  We know that Dan spent $6 on a lekkergoed and $3 on chocolate. So he spent a total of $6 + $3 = $9 on both items.
Response:  We know that Dan spent $5 in total and bought a chocolate bar for $3. So he must have spent $2 on something else. Since he bought a chocolate bar for $3, we can deduce that he did not buy any other item that costs $3 or more. Therefore, the only possible items he could have bought are the ones that cost $1 or $2. As he spent $2 on something else, let's assume he bought two items that each cost $1. So the total amount of money Dan spent on buying chocolate is $3 (for the chocolate bar) + $2 (for two $1 items) = $5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan paid R8 for a chocolate stick and he gave his friend R5 as change. So, if we subtract R5 from R8, we get R3. Therefore, there is R3 left over after Dan paid for the chocolate stick and gave his friend change.
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $3 more than he had at first, and we also know that he bought a chocolate stick for $4. So if we subtract the amount he had at first ($4) from what he spent ($3), we get:

$3 - $4 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Dan paid R3 10 for each chocolate bar and he bought 4 bars in total. So we can calculate how much money he spent as follows:

R3 10 x 4 = R12

Therefore, there are R12 worth of chocolate bars."
"Response:  We know that Dan paid $3 for two chocolates and each chocolate costs the same amount. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

2x = 3 (where x is the cost of one chocolate)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3/2

Therefore, each chocolate costs $3/2 or $1.50."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $5 in total and bought chocolate for $3 and candy for $7. So we can start by adding these two amounts together to find out how much he spent on both items:

$3 + $7 = $10

So far, we know that Dan spent $10 in total. But we also know that he paid $5 for the chocolate and candy, so we can subtract this amount from what he spent to find out how much he paid per item:

$10 - $5 = $5

Now we have our answer! Dan paid $5 for the chocolate and $5 for the candy."
Response:  We know that Dan spent $4 on a chocolate bar and $2 on some candy. So he spent a total of $4 + $2 = $6. To buy a chocolate bar, Dan paid more than what he paid for the candy, so we can say that he spent at least $6 to buy the chocolate bar. Therefore, the answer is $6.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books and he sold 78 of them in a motorhome sale. To find out how many books he has left, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had:

115 - 78 =?

The result is:

115 - 78 = 37

So, Paul has 37 books left at home."
Response:  We know that Paul had 137 books at first and then sold 105 of them. So, he has 32 books left (137 - 105 = 32).
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and he sold some of them in the motorhouse (we don't know how many). He also gave 35 books to his friend. So, if we subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had, we can find out how many books he has left.

108 - x = 62 (where x is the number of books he sold)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 46

So, Paul sold 46 books in the motorhouse."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books and bought some more at a motorhome sale. After buying those books, he had 151 books in total. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of books Paul bought at the motorhome sale.

We know that Paul started with 50 books (50), so the total number of books he had before buying any new ones is:

50 + x

After buying x books, Paul has a total of 151 books:

50 + x = 151

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:

50 + x - 50 = 151 - 50

x = 101

So Paul bought 101 books at the motorhome sale."
Response:  If Paul had two books and sold two in the motorhouse, then he has 2 - 2 = 0 books left. Now, if he bought 150 new books, then he has 150 + 0 = 150 books in total. So, Paul has 150 books now.
"Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books and sold a few of them to buy a new motorcycle. So he has fewer books now. If he bought 42 new ones, how many more books did he sell than he bought?

Let X be the number of books Paul sold. Since he sold some books to buy a motorcycle, we know that X < 21 (he didn't sell all his books).

Now, let Y be the number of new books he bought. We know that Y = 42 (he bought 42 new books).

Since Paul sold some books and then bought new ones, we can set up an equation based on what we know:

X + Y = 21 + 42

Simplifying the equation:

X + Y = 63

We also know that X < 21, so we can substitute X = 21 - Y into the equation:

(21 - Y) + Y = 63

Combine like terms:

Y + (21 - Y) = 63

Y + 0 = 63

Y = 63

So Paul sold 63 books. To find out how many more books he sold than he bought, we subtract the number of books he bought from the number of books he sold:

63 - 42 = 21

Paul sold 21 more books than he bought."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books before he sold some at a motorhome sale and now he has 38 more than what he sold. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the number of books Paul sold.
Then, Paul has 71 - x books left after selling x books.
Since he bought 38 new books, he now has:
71 - x + 38 = total number of books Paul has

Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of books Paul sold. To do this, we can subtract both sides of the equation from each other:

71 - x + 38 = 71 - x + (38)

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

71 - x + 38 = 71 - x + 38

We can see that the equations are equal, so we can equate them:

x + 38 = 71

Subtracting 38 from both sides:

x = 33

So Paul sold 33 books at the motorhome sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens before he sold some of them at a garage sale. After the sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left. So we can start by subtracting the number of items he sold from the total number of items he had:

108 - x = 66 (where x is the number of books he sold)

We also know that he sold some pens, so let's subtract the number of pens he sold from the total number of pens he had:

55 - y = 59 (where y is the number of pens he sold)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you solve for x and y to find out how many books and pens Paul sold at the garage sale?"
"Response:  We know that Paul had 106 pens before he sold some books and pens at a garage sale. After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So, we can start by subtracting the number of pens he sold from the total number of pens he had:

106 - x = 14 (where x is the number of pens he sold)

Now, let's solve for x. We know that Paul sold some books along with the pens, so we need to find out how many books he sold. The problem states that he sold ""a few"" books, but it doesn't specify exactly how many. Let's assume that he sold b books (where b is a positive integer). Then, we can write the equation as follows:

106 - x + b = 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + b = 92

Since x is the number of pens sold, we know that x must be a positive integer. Therefore, we can substitute x = k, where k is a positive integer, into the previous equation:

k + b = 92

Solving for k, we get:

k = 72

So, Paul sold 72 pens at the garage sale."
"Response:  If Paul had initially had 136 books and sold a couple of books in the garage sale, he must have sold some books to reduce his total number of books to 27. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of books Paul sold in the garage sale.

We know that Paul started with 136 books (136) and sold some books (x), so the number of books he has left is:

136 - x

Since Paul now has 27 books left, we can set up the following equation:

136 - x = 27

Now solve for x by subtracting 136 from both sides of the equation:

x = 136 - 27

x = 109

So Paul sold 109 books in the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. That means he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then we know that he sold some books in the motorhouse for a few books and is left with 95 - x books, where x is the number of books he sold in the motorhouse. So we can set up an equation:

95 - x = 68

We want to find out what value of x will make this equation true. To do so, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can subtract 95 from both sides of the equation:

x = 95 - 68

x = 27

So Paul sold 27 books in the motorhouse."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 95 pens and 153 books before he sold some of them at a garage sale. After the sale, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. So we can start by subtracting the number of books and pens he sold from his original total:

95 pens - 23 pens = 72 pens (left)
153 books - 13 books = 140 books (left)

Now we need to find out how many books he sold at the garage sale. To do this, we can subtract the number of books he has left from the total number of books he started with:

140 books - 13 books = 127 books (sold)

So Paul sold 127 books at the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paulus had 42 pens and 143 books before he sold some books and pens at the motorhouse auction. After the sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. So we can start by subtracting the number of books and pens he sold from his original total:

42 pens + 143 books = 185 items

If he sold x pens and y books, we can calculate how many items he had after the sale as follows:

x pens + y books =?

We know that he had 113 books and 19 pens left, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

x + y = 113 + 19

Solving for x and y gives us:

x = 19 (pens)
y = 94 (books)

So Paulus sold 19 pens and 94 books at the motorhouse auction."
"Response:  If there were originally ten roses in the vase and Jessica had eight more from her flower garden to add, then the total number of roses in the vase would be:
10 + 8 = 18
So, there are now 18 roses in the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were initially ""a few roses"" in the vase, and Jessica added 16 more roses from her flower garden to the vase. So, at the beginning, there were a few + 16 = 18 roses in the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 2 roses in the vase and Jessica removed 4 from the vase. So, if we subtract 4 from 2, we get:

2 - 4 =?

That gives us:

2 - 4 = 0

So, there are no more roses left in the vase after Jessica removed them. However, the problem states that Jessica also snapped some new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. Let's assume she added n new roses (since we don't know the exact number).

Now, we can add the number of new roses to the original number of roses in the vase:

0 + n =?

Since there are already 0 roses in the vase, adding any number of new roses will give us a total of:

0 + n = n

Therefore, the total number of roses in the vase now is:

n

So, the answer depends on how many new roses Jessica added to the vase."
"Response:  We know that Jessica had 15 roses in the vase and she removed 33 roses from the vase (she ""wentgegooi"" them). So, if we subtract 33 from 15, we get:

15 - 33 =?

That gives us:

15 - 33 = -18

Now, we need to find out how many more roses Jessica snapped from her bouquet to add to the vase. The question tells us that she added ""a few more"" new roses from her garden. Let's assume that she added x number of roses.

So, the total number of roses in the vase now would be:

-18 + x =?

We can solve for x by adding 18 to both sides of the equation:

-18 + x =?

+18 + x =?

x =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

Therefore, Jessica snapped 20 more roses from her bouquet to add to the vase, in addition to the 15 roses that were already there."
"Response:  We know that Jessica had 21 roses in the vase and she removed 34 roses from the vase. So, if we subtract 34 from 21, we get:

21 - 34 =?

The result is:

-13

So, Jessica removed 13 more roses from her garden than what she took out of the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were 7 roses in the vase initially and Jessica had taken out 59 roses from her bouquet garden. So, if we subtract 59 from 7, we get:

7 - 59 =?

The result is:

7 - 59 = -52

Now, we are told that there are 20 roses in the vase currently. If we add -52 to 20, we get:

20 + (-52) =?

The result is:

20 + (-52) = -32

Therefore, Jessica has snapped 32 roses."
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses in the vase and Jessica had 12 more from her flower garden, so together they have 25 roses. Now, we are told that there are 21 roses in the vase, so we can subtract 25 - 21 = 4 roses left in the garden. Therefore, there are 4 roses in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were originally 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica took some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica took, we can subtract the number of roses she took from the original number of roses: 15 - x = 17, where x is the number of roses Jessica took. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So, Jessica took 2 roses from her flower garden.
"Response:  We know that there were originally 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Jessica picked some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, there are 10 roses and 21 orchids left in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses that Jessica picked (let's assume she picked 2 roses) from the original number of roses, we get:

12 - 2 = 10

And if we subtract the number of orchids that Jessica picked (let's assume she picked 3 orchids) from the original number of orchids, we get:

2 - 3 = 0

So, Jessica picked 2 roses and 3 orchids."
Response:  We know that there were originally 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica took some roses and orchids from her flower garden to add to the vase. There were 3 more roses than orchids taken from the garden. So, if we let R be the number of roses taken from the garden, then there were 3R orchids taken from the garden. In total, there are now 12 roses (5 + R) and 2 orchids (3 + R) in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids there are in the vase, we can subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more roses than orchids in the vase.
"Response:  We know that there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase initially. Jessica picked some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, we are told that there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase, let's subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers:

20 (orchids) - 11 (roses) =?

The difference between the number of orchids and roses is 9. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase."
"Response:  If there were initially three roses in the vase and Jessica has now snapped 19 more roses to put in the vase, then we can calculate how many roses Jessica had to snap to fill the vase as follows:

19 (total number of roses) - 3 (initial number of roses) = 16

So, Jessica had to snap 16 more roses to fill the vase with 19 roses."
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Jessica picked some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, we are told that there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica picked, let's subtract the number of roses she picked from the original number of roses: 13 - x = 14 (where x is the number of roses Jessica picked). Solving for x, we get x = 1. So, Jessica picked one rose from her flower garden.
"Response:  We know that there were originally 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica took some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, there are 7 orchids and 13 roses left in the vase. To find out how many orchids Jessica took, we can subtract the number of orchids she took from the original number of orchids. In this case, if she took 3 orchids, then:

3 - 7 = -4

So, Jessica took 4 orchids from her flower garden."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Jessica picked some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, we have 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase, we can subtract the number of orchids from the total number of roses: 

22 - 21 = 1

So, there are 1 more rose than orchid in the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica picked some roses and orchids from her flower garden to put in the vase. Now, we have 13 orchids and 3 roses left in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase, let's subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers:

13 orchids - 3 roses = 10 more orchids than roses

So, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now."
Response:  If Robin had 17 inches of hair and she cut off a few centimeters (we don't know how many), then her new length would be less than 17 inches. Since she has 13 inches of hair now, we can subtract the number of centimeters she cut to find out how much of her hair she cut off. For example, if she cut off 5 centimeters, that would leave her with 12 inches of hair (17 - 5 = 12). So, Robin cut off 5 centimeters of her hair.
Response:  If Robin had 20 fingers and she cut off 10 of them, then she has 10 fingers left. So, before cutting off her fingers, she had 20 - 10 = 10 fingers.
Response:  If Robin had 16 inches long hair and she cut off 11 inches, then she has 5 inches left (16 - 11 = 5). Now, if she grew it back to 12 inches, then her new length of hair is also 5 inches + 12 = 17 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 17 inches long.
"Response:  If Robin grew 18 centimeters taller and she was originally 190 cm tall, then she is now:

190 + 18 = 208 cm tall."
"Response:  If Robin had 13 fingers on her hand before and now she has 1 less finger (i.e., 12 fingers), then she must have cut off one finger which was 14 cm long. So, the length of her remaining hand (from the wrist to the tip of her middle finger) would be:

12 fingers x 7.5 cm/finger = 90 cm

Therefore, the length of Robin's hand after cutting off one finger is 90 cm."
Response:  If Robin had 14 fingers and grew 8 fingers, then she would have had 22 fingers (14 + 8). But if she cut off 20 fingers, then she would be left with only 2 fingers (22 - 20 = 2). So Robin has 2 fingers now.
"Response:  If Danny has 12 bottle tops in his collection and he found 53 more in the park, then the total number of bottle tops he now has is:

12 + 53 = 65

So, Danny now has 65 bottle tops in his collection."
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he found more bottle caps in the park. So, if we add 21 to however many bottle caps he found in the park, we can find out how many bottle caps Danny has in total. If he found x bottle caps in the park, then Danny has 21 + x bottle caps in total. Therefore, the answer is 21 + x.
Response:  We know that Danny had 63 bottle caps at first and he threw away 51 of them. So, he has 63 - 51 = 12 bottle caps left. Now, he found 33 more bottle caps in the park, so he has 12 + 33 = 45 bottle caps in total. Therefore, Danny initially had 45 bottle caps.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 36 bottle caps in the park while he was throwing away 35 old ones. This means that he had 36 - 35 = 1 more bottle cap than what he threw away. Now, we know that he has 22 bottle caps left, so we can subtract 22 from 1 to find out how many more bottle caps he found in the park:

1 - 22 =?

The answer is 19. So, Danny found 19 more bottle caps in the park than what he threw away."
"Response:  We know that Danny found 30 bottle caps in the park while he threw away 63 old ones. So, if we subtract the number of old ones from the total number of bottle caps found, we get:

30 - 63 =?

Now, let's add the number of bottle caps Danny has in his collection (42) to the previous result:

30 - 63 + 42 =?

Can you solve for the missing number and tell me how many more bottle caps Danny threw away than what he found in the park?"
"Response:  We know that Danny had 22 bottle dopes and 8 packaging at first. If he found 28 bottled dopes and 63 packagings in the park, then we can subtract what he already had from what he found to find out how many new ones he got. So let's do that!

28 - 22 = 6 (new bottle dopes)

And how about the packaging?

63 - 8 = 55 (new packaging)

So, initially, Danny had 22 bottle dopes and 8 packaging, but after finding more in the park, he now has 6 new bottle dopes and 55 new packaging."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 22 bottle caps and 30 packaging pieces initially. He found 17 bottle caps and 57 packaging pieces in the park. So we can start by subtracting what he found from what he had initially:

22 - 17 = 5 (bottle caps)
30 - 57 = -27 (packaging pieces)

Now let's add up all the items Danny had at first:

5 + (-27) = -22

So Danny had 22 bottle caps and -22 packaging pieces initially."
"Response:  We know that Danny found 30 bottle caps and 14 packaging pieces in the park. He has 7 bottle caps and 86 packaging pieces in his collection now. To find out how many more bottle caps than packaging pieces he found in the park, we can subtract the number of packaging pieces from the total number of items he found:

30 (bottle caps) - 14 (packaging pieces) = 16

So, Danny found 16 more bottle caps than packaging pieces in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny found 11 bottle caps and 28 packaging pieces in the park. So we can start by subtracting what he already had from his total collection to find out how many more items he found in the park.

11 (bottle caps) + 28 (packaging pieces) = 39

Now let's look at the number of bottle caps. Danny already had 68 bottle caps before he went to the park, so we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found in the park from his total to find out how many more bottle caps he has:

68 - 11 = 57

So Danny found 57 more bottle caps than he already had. To find out how many more packaging pieces he found, we can do the same subtraction:

51 (packaging pieces) - 28 (found in park) = 23

Therefore, Danny found 23 more packaging pieces than he already had."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 71 bottle caps and 24 packaging items in the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 packaging items. To find out how many more bottle caps than packaging items Danny has now, we can subtract the number of packaging items from the number of bottle caps:

28 - 16 = 12

So, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than packaging items."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 10 bottle caps and 62 packaging pieces in the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 packaging pieces. To find out how many more packaging pieces than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the total number of packaging pieces. So, if we subtract 27 (bottle caps) from 43 (packaging pieces), we get:

43 - 27 =?

The result is:

43 - 27 = 16

So, Danny has 16 more packaging pieces than bottle caps."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 66 bottle caps at first and then lost some of them. He currently has 25 bottle caps left. To find out how many bottle caps Danny initially had, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he currently has from the total number of bottle caps he had:

66 - 25 =?

Solving for the unknown quantity (in this case, ""?""), we get:

66 - 25 = 41

So, Danny initially had 41 bottle caps."
Response:  If Danny had 25 bottle caps in his collection earlier and found 32 more in the park, then he has a total of 25 + 32 = 57 bottle caps now.
Response:  We know that Danny had 60 old bottles and found 58 new ones, so he started with a total of 60 + 58 = 118 bottles. Then he added 67 more, so he has a total of 118 + 67 = 185 bottles now. Therefore, Danny initially had 185 bottles.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 50 new bottle caps in the park and threw away 6 old ones. So, if we subtract the number of old bottle caps he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he found, we can find out how many more bottle caps he found in the park.

50 (new bottle caps) - 6 (old bottle caps thrown away) =?

Solution:

50 - 6 = 44

So, Danny found 44 more bottle caps in the park than what he threw away."
Response:  We know that Danny had 54 old bottles and found 48 new ones in the park. So he has a total of 52 bottles (54 - 48 = 52). To find out how many more bottles he threw away than what he found in the park, we need to subtract the number of new bottles from the total number of bottles he had: 52 - 48 = 4. Therefore, Danny threw away 4 more bottles than what he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 82 packages and 29 bottle caps in the park. If he had 42 bottle caps now, then he must have lost 29 - 42 = 13 bottle caps. So, initially, Danny had 29 bottle caps.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 packaging and 39 bottle dopes in the park. If he had 16 bottledopes and 68 packagings in his collection, then we can subtract the number of bottledopes he already had from the total number of packagings to find out how many packagings he had initially. So, if we subtract 16 from 68, we get 52. Therefore, Danny had 52 packagings initially.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 46 packaging and 50 bottle caps in the park. He has 21 bottle caps and 52 packagings in his collection now. So we can start by subtracting what he already has from what he found:

50 - 21 =? (bottle caps)

We get 29 more bottle caps than he already had. Now let's do the same for the packagings:

46 - 52 =? (packagings)

We get 6 fewer packagings than he already had. Therefore, Danny found 29 more bottle caps than packagings in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny found 65 packets and 5 bottle caps in the park. He has 31 bottle caps and 9 bottle packaging in his collection now. To find out how many more packets than bottle caps he found in the park, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he has from the total number of packets he found. So, if we subtract 31 (bottle caps) from 65 (packets), we get:

65 - 31 = 34

So, Danny found 34 more packets than bottle caps in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny has 58 bottle caps and 25 packaging items in total. He currently has 11 packaging items and 12 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps than packaging items he has, we can subtract the number of packaging items from the total number of bottle caps:

58 - 11 =?

The difference is 47. So, Danny has 47 more bottle caps than packaging items."
"Response:  We know that Danny has 15 bottle dopes and 18 packaging pieces in his collection. He also has 67 packages and 35 bottle tops in total. To find out how many more packaging pieces than bottle tops he has, we can subtract the number of bottle tops from the total number of packaging pieces. So, if we subtract 35 (bottle tops) from 67 (packaging pieces), we get: 

67 - 35 = 32

Therefore, Danny has 32 more packaging pieces than bottle tops."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 17 pets and subtracting 11 from it gives us... 
Jake has 6 less pets than Steven. So if Jake has 6 pets, then Steven must have... 
Therefore, Steven has 6 + 11 = 17 pets!"
Response:  We know that Steven has 15 pears and Jill has 14 more pears than Jake. So if we subtract 14 from 15, we get 1. That means Jill has one more pear than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 6 fewer pears than Jill, which is equal to 7 minus 6, or 1 fewer pear. So Jake has 1 fewer pear than Jill.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fewer people than Steven, and Steven has 19 people in total. So we can start by finding out how many people Steven has:

Steven has 19 people.

Now, let's find out how many people Jake has. If Jake has 18 fewer people than Steven, then we can subtract 18 from 19 to get the number of people Jake has:

Jake has 19 - 18 = 1 people.

Finally, we need to find out how many people Jill has. We know that Jill has 13 more people than Jake, so we can add 13 to the number of people Jake has to get the number of people Jill has:

Jill has 1 + 13 = 14 people.

Therefore, Jill has 14 people."
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pigs than Steven and Steven has 5 pigs. So if we subtract 3 from 5, we get 2. Therefore, Jake has 2 more pigs than Steven. If Jill has 8 more pigs than Steven, then she has 8 + 2 = 10 more pigs than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven, and Steven has 4 more people than Jill. So if we let J be the number of people Jake has, then Steven has J + 4 people. And Jill has J - 11 people. 
We can start with J = 10 (just an arbitrary value). Then:
Jake has 10 - 12 = -2 people
Steven has 10 + 4 = 14 people
Jill has 10 - 11 = -1 people
Now we have three equations:
Jake has no people (-2 is not possible)
Steven has 14 people
Jill has -1 person
Can you solve for J?"
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer pigs than Steven and 9 more pigs than Jill. So if Steven has 16 pigs, then Jake must have 16 - 7 = 9 pigs. And since Jake has 9 more pigs than Jill, Jill must have 9 + 1 = 10 pigs. Therefore, Jake has 9 pigs and Jill has 10 pigs.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer pigs than Steven and 8 more pigs than Jill. So if Steven has 17 pigs, how many pigs does Jake have? First, we subtract 7 from 17 to find out how many pigs Jake has: 
17 - 7 = 10
Jake has 10 pigs. Now, we add 8 to 10 to find out how many pigs Jill has: 
10 + 8 = 18
Jill has 18 pigs."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer people than Steven and 18 more people than Jill. So we can start with these two equations:

Jake - Steven = 9... (1)
Jake + 18 = Jill... (2)
Now let's solve for the unknown variable (Steven). Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we get:

Jake = Steven + 18... (3)
Now we are given that Steven has 16 people. Substituting this into equation (3), we get:

Jake = 16 + 18 = 34
So Jake has 34 people. Therefore, Steven has 34 - 16 = 18 more people than Jill."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more pigs than Jill. So if Jill has x pigs, then Steven has x + 18 pigs. 
We also know that Jake has 6 fewer pigs than Jill. So if Jill has x pigs, then Jake has x - 6 pigs. 
Now we can set up an equation based on this information: 
x + (x + 18) = Jake's number of pigs 
Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = Jake's number of pigs 
Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = Jake's number of pigs - 18 
Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = Jake's number of pigs / 2 
So Jake has half of Jill's number of pigs, or 50% of her pigs. Therefore, Jake has 50% of 18 = 9 pigs."
Response:  We know that Steven has 5 more pigs than Jake and Jill has 87 pigs. So we can start by finding out how many pigs Jake has. If Steven has 5 more pigs than Jake, then Jake has 5 fewer pigs than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 5 less than 87, which is 82 pigs. Now we need to find out how much more pigs Jill has compared to Jake. Since Jill has 87 pigs and Jake has 82 pigs, Jill has 5 more pigs than Jake (87 - 82 = 5). Therefore, Jake has 82 pigs, and Jill has 87 pigs plus 5 more, which is 92 pigs. So Jake has 82 pigs, and Jill has 92 pigs.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer people than Steven, so if Steven has x people, then Jake has x - 16 people. 
We also know that Jill has 12 more people than Jake, so if Jake has x - 16 people, then Jill has x + 12 people. 
So we can set up an equation based on this information:
x - 16 = Jake's number of people
x + 12 = Jill's number of people
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add both equations together. When we add them together, we get:
2x - 4 = Jake's number of people + Jill's number of people
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
2x - 4 = (x - 16) + (x + 12)
Combine like terms:
2x - 4 = x + 28
Solving for x, we get:
x = 32
Therefore, Jill has 32 + 12 = 44 people, which is 14 more people than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven and 79 more apples. So we can start with what Steven has first. 
Steven has 19 people and 14 apples. Okay, so let's write it down like this: 
19 + 14 = 33 
Now, if Jake has 12 fewer people than Steven, that means Jake has 12 - 19 = 7 fewer people. And since Jake also has 79 more apples than Steven, we can add that to the number of people he has: 
7 + 33 = 40 
So, Jake has 40 people in total."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven and 3 more apples. So if Steven has x pears and y apples, then Jake has x - 13 pears and y + 3 apples. Now we can substitute these values into our equation to solve for y. 
First, let's write down what we know about Steven's fruit:
x = number of pears
y = number of apples
Now, let's write down what we know about Jake's fruit:
x - 13 = number of pears
y + 3 = number of apples
Next, we need to find out how many pears Jake has. To do this, we can substitute x - 13 into the first equation:
x - 13 = number of pears
We know that x is equal to 9, so we can substitute that in:
9 - 13 = number of pears
This simplifies to:
-4 = number of pears
There are no negative pears, so there must be zero pears! This means that Jake only has apples. Now we can use the second equation to find out how many apples he has:
y + 3 = number of apples
We know that y is equal to 8, so we can substitute that in:
8 + 3 = number of apples
This simplifies to:
11 = number of apples
So Jake has 11 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer pears and 8 more apples than Steven. So if we start with Steven's number of pears and apples, we can subtract the number of pears that Jake has to find out how many pears Steven has. Then we can add 8 to find out how many apples Steven has. Finally, we compare the two numbers to see which one is greater. Here's the calculation:

Steven's number of pears = 17
Jake's number of pears = 17 - 6 = 11
Steven's number of apples = 16 + 8 = 24

Now let's compare the two numbers:

Steven's pears: 17 > 11 (true)
Steven's apples: 24 >? (wait for it...)

So Steven has more pears and apples than Jake!"
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer people and 10 more apples than Steven. So we can start with what Steven has:

Steven has 12 people and 15 apples.

Now let's find out how many apples Jake has:

Jake has 12 - 3 = 9 people (since he has 3 fewer people)
And Jake has 15 + 10 = 25 apples (since he has 10 more apples)

So Jake has 9 people and 25 apples.

To find out how much more apples Steven has per person, we need to divide the number of apples he has by the number of people he has:

15 / 12 = 1.25 apples/person

Now we can calculate how much more apples Steven has per person compared to Jake:

1.25 apples/person (Steven) - 25 apples/person (Jake) = 23.75 apples/person (more for Steven)

Therefore, Steven has 23.75 more apples per person than Jake does."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 12 more than Jake. So if Jake has x perske, then Steven has x + 12 perske. Now we are given that Jake has 4 fewer than Steven. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + 12 = (x + 12) - 4

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = x + 8

Solving for x:

2x = 8

x = 4

So Jake has 4 perske."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 18 pigs and Jake has 12 fewer pigs than Steven. So if we subtract 12 from 18, we get:

18 - 12 =?

That gives us:

18 - 12 = 6

So Jake has 6 pigs. Now we need to find out how many pigs Jill has. We know that Jill has 8 more pigs than Jake. So if we add 8 to 6, we get:

6 + 8 =?

That gives us:

6 + 8 = 14

Therefore, Jill has 14 pigs."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 19 pigs and Jake has 12 fewer pigs than Steven. So if we subtract 12 from 19, we get:

19 - 12 =?

That gives us:

19 - 12 = 7

So Jake has 7 pigs."
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 pears and Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven. So, if we subtract 6 from 14, we get 8. That means Jake has 8 pears. Now, we are asked how many pears Jill has. To find out, we need to add the number of pears Jake has (8) to the number of pears Steven has (14). Therefore, Jill has 22 pears.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer pears. So if Steven has x pears, Jake has x + 84 pears. Also, we know that Steven has 13 pears and 52 apples. Therefore, we can set up two equations:

x + (x + 84) = 52... (1)
x = 13... (2)

Solving equation (1) for x, we get:

x = 52 - 84 = -32

But this is not possible since x cannot be negative! So, we must have found our solution. Jake has 13 pears like Steven."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven and Steven has 8 persimmons. So if we add the number of apples and persimmons that Steven has, we can find out how many apples Jake has.  
Let's start with the number of persimmons that Steven has:  
8 + 12 = 20  
Now let's add the number of apples that Steven has to the total number of persimmons he has:  
20 + 12 = 32  
So Steven has a total of 32 fruits (20 persimmons and 12 apples). Now we need to find out how many apples Jake has. Since Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, we can calculate the number of apples Jake has by adding 13 to the number of apples that Steven has:  
32 + 13 = 45  
Therefore, Jake has 45 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer pears and 10 more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples, Jake has x - 8 apples. Also, we know that Steven has 11 apples. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x = 11 + (x-8)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 19

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 9

So, Steven has 9 apples. Now let's find out how many more pears Steven has than apples:

Number of pears = Number of apples + 8

Substituting x = 9:

Number of pears = 9 + 8

Number of pears = 17

Therefore, Steven has 17 pears. To find out how much more pears Steven has than apples, subtract the number of apples from the number of pears:

17 - 9 = 8

Steven has 8 more pears than apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pigs and 4 more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples and y pigs, then Jake has x - 3 apples and y + 4 pigs. Now we are given that Steven has 19 apples and 15 pigs. So we can substitute these values into our equation to get:

x = 19 (apples)
y = 15 (pigs)

Now we need to find out how many more apples Jake has compared to Steven. To do this, we subtract the number of apples Jake has from the number of apples Steven has:

(x - (x - 3)) = (19 - (19 - 3))
= 19 - 6
= 13

So Jake has 13 more apples than Steven!"
Response:  If Olivia had $78 in her purse and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then she has $78 - $15 = $63 left in her purse.
Response:  If Olivia had $78 and spent $33 at the supermarket, then she has $78 - $33 = $45 left.
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $100 in her purse and she spent $148 at the store. So, how much did she spend in total? To find out, we need to add the amount she already had ($100) to the amount she spent ($148):

$100 + $148 = $248

Therefore, Olivia spent a total of $248."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $3 in her purse and spent $49 at the supermarket. So, she has $49 - $3 = $46 left. She also received $49 from the OTM, so she has a total of $46 + $49 = $95. Therefore, Olivia collected $95 from the OTM, which is $49 more than what she spent at the supermarket.
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $53 in her purse and spent $91 at the grocery store, leaving her with $14. To find out how much more she spent at the supermarket than what she collected from the OTM, we need to subtract the amount she collected from the amount she spent:

$91 - $14 = $77

So, Olivia spent an additional $77 at the supermarket beyond what she collected from the OTM."
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her purse before she went shopping. After she spent $49 at the movie theater, she had $26 left. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$106 - $49 = $26

Solving for the missing amount, we get:

$106 - $49 = $57

Therefore, Olivia spent $57 at the supermarket."
Response:  If there were $54 in her purse initially and she spent $29 at the supermarket, then she has $54 - $29 = $25 left in her purse.
Response:  If Olivia had $128 and she spent $38 at the supermarket, then she has $128 - $38 = $90 left.
Response:  If Dave had 19 programs on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 programs left on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had 20 programs on his phone at first and he deleted 18 of them. So, he has 20 - 18 = 2 programs left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 10 programs on his phone and added 11 new ones, then he has a total of 21 programs (10 + 11). If he has only 4 left after removing a few, then he must have removed 17 programs (21 - 4 = 17).
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 programs on his phone and he added 89 new ones. After removing a few, he had 24 left. So, if we subtract the number of programs he removed (a few) from the total number of programs he had before adding the new ones (21), we get:

21 - x = 24

where x is the number of programs he removed. Solving for x, we get:

x = 3

So, Dave removed 3 programs. Now, let's find out how many more programs he added than he removed:

89 - 3 = 86

Therefore, Dave added 86 more programs than he removed."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 programs on his phone and added 71 new ones. After removing a few, he had 14 left. To find out how many more programs he removed than what he added, we need to subtract the number of new programs from the original number of programs. So, if he started with 15 programs and added 71, then:

15 (original) - 71 (new) =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 lessons on his phone before he removed some programs and lessons. After removing a few programs and lessons, he was left with 5 programs and 23 lessons. To find out how many apps Dave removed, we need to subtract the number of apps he had after removing some programs and lessons from the total number of apps he had initially. So, let's do that:

Total number of apps initially = 16
Number of apps after removing some programs and lessons = 5

Subtracting the two numbers gives us:

16 - 5 = 11

So, Dave removed 11 apps from his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 apps and 21 lessons on his phone. After he removed a few programs and lessons, he was left with 3 programs and 7 lessons. To find out how many lessons Dave removed, we can subtract the number of lessons he had after removing the programs from the total number of lessons he had initially. So, if he had 21 lessons initially and removed some, he would have been left with 7 lessons. Therefore, Dave removed 21 - 7 = 14 lessons.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 programs and 24 lessons on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting, he was left with 21 programs and 4 lessons. To find out how many more apps than lessons he has, we need to subtract the number of lessons from the total number of programs. So, we can say:

Number of more apps = Total number of programs - Number of lessons
= 21 - 4
= 17

Therefore, Dave has 17 more apps than lessons on his phone."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 19 apps and 18 lessons on his phone before he deleted some programs and lessons. After deleting, he was left with 6 programs and 15 lessons. To find out how many more lessons than programs he has, we need to subtract the number of programs from the total number of lessons. So, let's do that:

15 (lessons) - 6 (programs) =?

The difference between the two numbers is:

15 - 6 = 9

So, Dave has 9 more lessons than programs on his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 programs on his phone and he added two more. So, if we add 2 to 17, we get 19. Therefore, Dave added 2 programs to his phone.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 59 lessons and 15 programs on his phone before he removed some of them. After removing a few programs and lessons, he was left with 12 programs and 30 lessons. So we can start by subtracting the number of programs and lessons he removed from the total number of programs and lessons he had initially.

Let x be the number of programs Dave removed.
Since each program had y lessons associated with it (where y is a constant), Dave also removed y lessons for each program he removed.
So the total number of lessons Dave removed is x \* y.

Now we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

59 - x = 12 + x (since he kept 12 programs)

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

59 - x = 12 + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 47

So Dave removed 47 programs and lessons in total."
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 lessons and 13 programs on his phone. He removed a few programs and lessons, leaving him with 17 programs and 21 lessons. To find out how many lessons he removed, we can subtract the number of lessons he had after removing programs from the total number of lessons he started with. In this case, he had 21 - 24 = 3 fewer lessons. So, Dave removed 3 lessons.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 24 apps and 9 learners on his phone initially. After he removed some programs and learners, he was left with 5 learners and 12 programs. To find out how many more apps than learners he has, we need to subtract the number of learners from the total number of apps. So, if we subtract 5 (the number of learners) from 24 (the total number of apps), we get:

24 - 5 = 19

So, Dave has 19 more apps than learners on his phone."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 11 programs and 3 leaders on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting, he was left with 24 leaders and 2 programs. To find out how many more leaders than programs Dave has, we need to subtract the number of programs from the total number of leaders. So, let's do that:

24 leaders - 2 programs =?

We get:

24 - 2 = 22

So, Dave has 22 more leaders than programs on his phone."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 242 cards in total and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can subtract 136 from 242 to find out how many cards Nell has left.

242 - 136 =?

The result is:

242 - 136 = 106

Therefore, Nell has 106 cards left after giving 136 cards to Jeff."
Response:  We know that Nell had 301 cards initially and gave 154 to Jeff. So, she has 301 - 154 = 147 cards left. Therefore, Nell had 147 cards initially.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and she gave some of them to Jeff. She has 252 cards left now. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Nell had 528 cards:

528 - x = 252 (where x is the number of cards Jeff received)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 528:

x = (252 / 528) * 528

x = 24 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

So Nell gave Jeff 24 cards."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, if she had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she must have given him at least 234 cards (since he had 234 cards). Now, we need to find out how many cards Jeff has after receiving the cards from Nell. To do this, we can subtract the number of cards she gave him from her total number of cards. In other words, we can subtract 234 from 566. When we do this, we get:

566 - 234 =?

The result is:

566 - 234 = 332

So, Jeff now has 332 cards."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 10-card packs. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 10-card packs. To find out how many more baseball cards than 10-card packs Nell has, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs from the number of baseball cards.  
Subtracting 149 (number of 10-card packs) from 415 (baseball cards):  
415 - 149 =?  
The difference is 266. Therefore, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than 10-card packs."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 10-card packs in total. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, so now she has 404 baseball cards. To find out how many more 10-card packs she has than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has from the total number of cards she had before giving any away. So, let's do this:

404 - 246 = 158

This means that Nell has 158 more 10-card packs than baseball cards."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards in total and she gave 195 to John and some more to Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to John from her total number of cards, we get:

573 - 195 = 378

Now, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. To do this, we can subtract the number of cards she gave to John from the remaining cards she has:

378 - 195 = 183

Therefore, Nell gave 183 cards to Jeff."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 18 10-card packs and gave some of her cards to Jeff. She now has 55 10-card packs and 178 baseball cards in total. To find out how many more baseball cards she has than 10-card packs, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs from the total number of baseball cards. So, let's do that:

178 - 55 =?

Do you want to try solving this subtraction problem yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 10-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 376 10-card packs and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more 10-card packs than baseball cards she has, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of 10-card packs:  
376 - 111 = 265  
So, Nell has 265 more 10-card packs than baseball cards."
"Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 19 cookies and had 35 cookies overall. To find out how many cookies he had at first, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had. So, if we subtract 19 from 35, we get:

35 - 19 = 16

So, Paco had 16 cookies at first."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them. He also has 7 cookies left. So if we subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had, we can find out how many cookies he ate.

Let x be the number of cookies Paco ate. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:

x + 7 = 28 (since Paco had 28 cookies to start with)

Now solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 7 - 7 = 28 - 7

x = 14

So Paco ate 14 cookies."
Response:  If PaCo had 40 cookies and ate 2 of them, then he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. Now, if he buys 3 more cookies, he will have 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has eaten more cookies than what he bought (23 - 3 = 20).
"Response:  We know that Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, how many cookies does Paco have left?  
We can use subtraction to find out:

13 - 2 =?

Can you solve for the number of cookies Paco has left?"
Response:  We know that Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 5 of them. That means he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Then we are told that he gave 13 cookies to his friend, so he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, Paco still has 22 cookies left.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them. He gave 13 of those cookies to his friend. So, how many more cookies did Paco eat than he gave away? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies he gave away from the total number of cookies he had: 17 - 13 =? 
The correct answer is 4. Paco ate 4 more cookies than he gave away."
Response:  We know that Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them. That means he has eaten 16 - 12 = 4 more cookies than he had initially. Now, we are asked how many more cookies he gave to his friend than he ate himself. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had. So, if he had 12 cookies and ate 4, then he has 12 - 4 = 8 cookies left. Therefore, he gave 8 cookies to his friend.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 sour cookies in total. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 sour cookies. So, we can start by subtracting the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had:

22 (sweet cookies) + 75 (sour cookies) =?

First, let's subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate:

22 - 15 =?

Now, let's subtract the number of sour cookies he ate:

75 - 54 =?

So, Paco still has:

22 - 15 = 7

75 - 54 = 21

Therefore, Paco still has 7 sweet cookies and 21 sour cookies left."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies initially. He ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 sour cookies. So, we can start by listing what Paco ate:

Sweet cookies: 9 + 36 = 45
Sour cookies: 6 + 3 = 9

Now, let's find out how many sweet and sour cookies Paco has left:

Sweet cookies: 45 - 36 = 9 (he has 9 sweet cookies left)
Sour cookies: 9 - 3 = 6 (he has 6 sour cookies left)

So, Paco has 9 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies left."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 sour cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 sour cookies. To find out how many more sweet cookies he ate than sour cookies, we need to subtract the number of sour cookies he ate from the number of sweet cookies he ate. So, let's do that:

5 (sweet cookies eaten) - 2 (sour cookies eaten) =?

Now, we can calculate the difference:

5 - 2 = 3

So, Paco ate 3 more sweet cookies than sour cookies."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies initially. He ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 sour cookies in total. To find out how many more sour cookies he ate than sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of sour cookies he ate. So, let's do that:

34 - 20 =?

The difference is 14. Therefore, Paco ate 14 more sour cookies than sweet cookies."
Response:  If Paco had 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them, then he has one cookie left. So, if Paco had 37 cookies, he ate 36 of them, which means he has one cookie left. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Paco had 36 cookies and he gave 14 to his friend. That means he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. He also ate 10 cookies, so he has 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left. Therefore, Paco still has 12 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 41 cookies and he gave 9 to his friend. That means he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. He ate 18 of them, so he ate more than he gave to his friend. Specifically, he ate 18 more cookies than he gave away.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 6 cookies and he gave 30 to his friend. That means he has 6 - 30 = -24 cookies left. But we also know that he ate 23 cookies. So, if he ate 23 cookies and he didn't have any more, then he must have eaten all of them! Therefore, he ate all 24 cookies (-24) that he didn't give to his friend. 
So, to summarize: Paco gave his friend 30 cookies and ate 24 cookies himself. He did not eat any more than what he gave to his friend."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 97 sweet cookies and 34 sour cookies in total. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 56 sour cookies. So we can start by subtracting the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had:

97 (sweet) + 34 (sour) = 131

Now let's subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies:

97 - 15 = 82

And now let's subtract the number of sour cookies he ate from the total number of sour cookies:

34 - 56 = -22

So Paco still has 82 sweet cookies and -22 sour cookies."
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 sweet cookies and 17 sour cookies in total. He ate 14 sweet cookies and 9 sour cookies. To find out how many sour cookies he still has, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of sour cookies he had. So, if he had 17 sour cookies and ate 9, then he still has 8 sour cookies left (17 - 9 = 8). Therefore, Paco still has 8 sour cookies left.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 sour cookies in total. He ate 23 sour cookies and 32 sweet cookies. To find out how many more sweet cookies he ate than sour cookies, we need to subtract the number of sour cookies he ate from the number of sweet cookies he ate. So, let's do that:

32 (sweet cookies) - 23 (sour cookies) = 9

So, Paco ate 9 more sweet cookies than sour cookies."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 sour cookies in total. He ate 28 sour cookies and 15 sweet cookies. To find out how many more sour cookies he ate than sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of sour cookies he ate. So, if we subtract 15 (the number of sweet cookies he ate) from 28 (the number of sour cookies he ate), we get:

28 - 15 = 13

So, Paco ate 13 more sour cookies than sweet cookies."
"Response:  We know that Gwen spent $7 and had $5 left over. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$7 - $5 = $__ (Gwen spent)

We want to find out how much Gwen spent in total. To do this, we need to fill in the blank with the correct amount. Think about what you know about subtraction...

If we subtract $5 from $7, we get:

$7 - $5 = $2

So Gwen spent $2!"
Response:  We know that Gwen received $8 in total and spent $6 of it. So, she has $8 - $6 = $2 left. Therefore, Gwen received $2 for her birthday.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad, for a total of $6. She spent $3, so she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
"Response:  We know that Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, for a total of $13. She spent $4, so she has $9 left. To find out how much more money she received from her mom than from her dad, we need to subtract what she received from her dad from what she received from her mom. In other words, we can set up an equation like this:

$9 = $8 - $5

Solving for the difference, we get:

$9 = $8 - $5
$9 = $3

So, Gwen received $3 more from her mom than from her dad."
Response:  We know that Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad, for a total of $9. She spent $4, so she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. Therefore, Gwen received $5 more from her dad than from her mom.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her dad and $7 from her mom, for a total of $12. She spent $4, so she has $12 - $4 = $8 left. Therefore, Gwen received $8 more from her mom than what she got from her dad.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, for a total of $7. If she spent $6, then she must have had $1 more than what she spent, so she had $6 + $1 = $7 + $1 = $8 in total. Therefore, Gwen received $8 from her parents.
"Response:  If Josh had 9 knick-knacks and lost a few, he has 9 - x (lost) knick-knacks now, where x is the number of knick-knacks he lost. Since he has 4 knick-knacks left, we can set up the equation:

9 - x = 4

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

So Josh lost 5 knick-knacks."
Response:  If Josh had a few marbles in his collection and lost 21 of them, then he must have had at least 21 - 1 = 20 marbles left in his collection. Now, if he has 12 marbles, that means he had 20 - 12 = 8 more marbles in his collection before losing any. So, Josh had 8 + 12 = 20 marbles in his collection initially.
Response:  If Josh had 19 marbles initially and lost 11 of them, then he has 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left. Now, if he found 5 new ones, then he has 8 + 5 = 13 marbles in total. So, Josh has 13 marbles now.
Response:  We know that Josh had 4 knick-knacks initially and lost 16 of them. So, he had 4 - 16 = -12 knick-knacks left. Then, he found 8 new ones, so he has -12 + 8 = 6 knick-knacks now. Therefore, he lost 16 - 6 = 10 more knick-knacks than what he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 7 knick-knacks initially and lost 8 of them. So, he had 7 - 8 = -1 knick-knacks left. Then, he found 10 new ones. So, his total number of knick-knacks now is -1 + 10 = 9. Therefore, Josh found 9 more knick-knacks than what he lost.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left. So, Josh has 14 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh had 20 candies and gave 2 to Jack, then he has 20 - 2 = 18 candies left. So, Josh has 18 candies now.
Response:  If Josh had 22 marbles and Jack gave him 20 more, then Josh now has 22 + 20 = 42 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 19 marbles and lost 11 of them, then he has 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left.
Response:  If Josh had 22 marbles and found 13 more, then he has a total of 22 + 13 = 35 marbles now. But if he lost 5 marbles, then he has 35 - 5 = 30 marbles left. So, Josh has 30 marbles now.
Response:  We know that Josh had 15 marbles in total and found 9 of them. So, he has 15 - 9 = 6 marbles left. He lost 23 - 9 = 14 marbles. Therefore, Josh lost 14 more marbles than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 3 marbles to start with and he found 6 more. That means he has a total of 3 + 6 = 9 marbles now. He lost 5 marbles, so he has 9 - 5 = 4 marbles left. Therefore, Josh found 9 - 5 = 4 more marbles than he lost.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father have weighed their potatoes together and they weigh 4 pounds in total. If Marco's share of the potatoes weighs 19 pounds more than his father's share, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.
Let M be the weight of Marco's share of the potatoes and P be the weight of his father's share. Since they weigh together 4 pounds, we can write:
M + P = 4...(1)
We are also given that Marco's share weighs 19 pounds more than his father's share, so we can write:
M = P + 19...(2)
Now we can substitute (2) into (1):
P + (P + 19) = 4
2P + 19 = 4
2P = 4 - 19
2P = -15
P = -8
So, Marco's father's share of the potatoes weighs 8 pounds. Therefore, Marco's share of the potatoes weighs 19 pounds more than his father's share, which is:
M = P + 19 = -8 + 19 = 11 pounds."
"Response:  We know that Marco's sheep weighed 13 pounds and his father's sheep weighed 35 pounds. To find out how much more his father's sheep weighed than Marco's sheep, we can subtract 13 from 35:

35 - 13 = 22

So, his father's sheep weighed 22 pounds more than Marco's sheep."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father have weighed their potatoes together and they weigh 20 pounds in total. So, if Marco's father's potatoes weigh 17 pounds, then Marco's potatoes must weigh 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3).
Response:  We know that Marco's bag of potatoes weighed 8 pounds and his father's bag weighed 32 pounds. To find out how much they weighed together, we need to add their weights. So, if we add 8 + 32 = 40 pounds, that is how much they weighed together.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his pack collected 24 pounds of potatoes together. If they lost 9 pounds on their way back, then they have 15 pounds (24 - 9) left. Since Marco's share is 3 pounds, we can calculate his father's share as follows: 

15 pounds / 3 = 5 pounds

So, Marco's father's share of the potatoes is 5 pounds."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father collected 36 pounds of potatoes together. Then, Marco's father lost 8 pounds of potatoes on their way back home. So, the total weight of potatoes that Marco's father has left is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds. Now, let's find out how much Marco's father's share of the potatoes weighs. Since they divided the potatoes equally between them, Marco's father's share would be half of 28 pounds, which is 28 / 2 = 14 pounds. Therefore, Marco's father's share of the potatoes weighs 14 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father collected 22 pounds of potatoes together. Then, Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of potatoes on their way back home. So, in total, they have collected 52 pounds (22 + 30) of potatoes. Since each bag of potatoes weighs 36 pounds, Marco's father has 5 bags of potatoes (52 / 36 = 5). Therefore, Marco's father's share of the potatoes is 5 x 36 = 180 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father have a total of 37 pounds of potatoes. If Marco has 5 pounds of potatoes, then his father must have 32 pounds (37 - 5 = 32).
Response:  We know that Marco's weight is 30 pounds and his partner's weight is 17 pounds. So, if they work together, their combined weight will be 30 + 17 = 47 pounds. Therefore, Marco's share of the weight would be 47 - 17 = 30 pounds more than his partner's share.
"Response:  We know that Marco's bag of potatoes weighed 10 pounds and his father's bag weighed 26 pounds more than Marco's. So if we let X be the weight of Marco's father's bag, then we can write an equation based on the information given:
X = 10 + 26
X = 36
So Marco's father's bag weighed 36 pounds more than Marco's bag."
"Response:  We know that Marco's father's arbee weighed 11 pounds and together they weighed 30 pounds. So if we subtract 11 from 30, we get: 
30 - 11 = 19 pounds. Therefore, Marco's arbee weighed 19 pounds."
"Response:  We know that there were already two children in the bus before the halt, and more children climbed onto the bus at the halt. So, if we add the number of children who were already in the bus (2) to the number of children who climbed onto the bus at the halt (more than 2), we get:

2 + x = 10

where x is the number of children who climbed onto the bus at the halt. Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

So, there are now 8 more children on the bus than there were before the halt."
Response:  We know that there were 26 children already on the bus and 38 more got on at the bus stop. So if we add 26 + 38, we get a total of 64 children on the bus.
"Response:  We know that there were 41 children in total on the bus after it stopped at the bus stop. This means that if we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (2), we will have the number of children who were already on the bus before it reached the bus stop. So, we can set up an equation as follows:

41 - 2 = x

where x is the number of children who were on the bus before it reached the bus stop. Solving for x, we get:

x = 39

Therefore, there were 39 children on the bus before it reached the bus stop."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and some children got down at the bus stop, leaving 21 children in the bus. So, we can say that the number of children who got down at the bus stop is equal to the difference between 43 and 21, which is:

43 - 21 = 22

Therefore, 22 children got down at the bus stop."
"Response:  We know that there were 41 children in the bus initially and some children got down at the bus stop, leaving 18 children in the bus. So, we need to find out how many more children were in the bus before the bus stop than what is left now (18).

To do this, we can subtract the number of children who got down from the initial number of children:

41 - 18 =?

The answer is 23. Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus before the bus stop than what is left now (18)."
Response:  We know that there were 21 children in the bus initially and 10 got down at the bus stop leaving 16 children in the bus. So, 6 children climbed into the bus at the bus stop.
"Response:  We know that there were 5 children in the bus to start with and 63 children got off the bus while a few more climbed onto the bus. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children, we can find out how many more children climbed onto the bus.

63 - 5 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that there were 36 children in the bus initially and 68 children got off the bus while a few more climbed onto the bus. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children, we can find out how many more children got off than climbed on.

36 (initial) - 68 (got off) =?

Solution:

36 - 68 = 32

So, 32 more children got off the bus than climbed on."
"Response:  We know that there were two children in the bus initially. Then, 40 more children climbed onto the bus while others got off. So, if we subtract the initial number of children (2) from the total number of children who boarded the bus (40), we get:

40 - 2 = 38

Therefore, 38 children got off the bus at the bus stop."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 28 children in the bus, and 82 children got on the bus while others got off. So, if we subtract the initial number of children (28) from the total number of children who got on the bus (82), we get:

82 - 28 = 54

Therefore, there were 54 more children who got on the bus than those who got off."
"Response:  We know that there were 8 children in the bus to start with. Then, 24 children climbed onto the bus while others got off. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children, we can find out how many more children got off than those who climbed on.

24 (total) - 8 (in the bus to start) =?

Subtracting 8 from 24 gives us:

24 - 8 = 16

So, 16 more children got off the bus than those who climbed on."
"Response:  We know that baker has made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them. To find out how many more cakes he has made than what he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made. So, if we do this, we get:

133 - 51 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that the baker has 54 cakes and he sold some of them. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from 54, we will get the remaining number of cakes he still has. In this case, if he sold ""a pair"" of cakes, which means he sold two cakes, then we can subtract 2 from 54 to get the remaining number of cakes.

54 - 2 =?

The answer is 52. Therefore, the baker still has 52 cakes left after selling two pairs of cakes."
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 145 of their cookies and they have 72 left. So we can start by subtracting the number of cookies sold from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies are left.

145 - 72 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
Response:  If Baker had 155 cookies and his friend bought 140 of them, then Baker has 155 - 140 = 15 cookies left.
"Response:  We know that the baker has 121 cakes in total and he sold 105 of them. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes, we get:

121 - 105 =?

That gives us:

16

So, the baker still has 16 cakes left."
Response:  We know that the baker has 13 cakes in total and he sold 91 of them. So, the number of cakes left with him is 13 - 91 = 32. Now, we are told that he bought 154 new cakes. So, the total number of cakes the baker now has is 32 + 154 = 186. Therefore, the baker has purchased more cakes than what he sold (186 - 91 = 95).
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 78 cakes and bought 31 new ones. So we can start by subtracting the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had to begin with. Total number of cakes = 170 - 78 = 92. Now we need to find out how many more cakes the baker sold than he bought. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes he bought from the total number of cakes he had to begin with. Number of cakes sold more than bought = 92 - 31 = 61. Therefore, the baker sold 61 more cakes than he bought.
Response:  We know that the baker has made 110 cookies in total and sold 75 of them. So, he still has 76 - 75 = 1 cookie left. Therefore, the baker still has one cookie left.
Response:  We know that the baker made 144 cookies in total and sold 71 of them. So, he has 144 - 71 = 73 cookies left. Now we need to find out how many more cookies the baker made than what he sold. To do this, we subtract the number of cookies sold from the total number of cookies made: 73 - 71 = 2. Therefore, the baker made 2 more cookies than what he sold.
Response:  If Bakker sold 10 cakes and 90 pastries, then he has 149 - 10 = 139 cakes left. And if he sold 90 pastries, then he has 91 - 90 = 1 pastries left. So, Bakker still has 139 cakes and 1 pastries left.
Response:  If the baker has 15 cakes and he sold 103 cakes, then he must have had 103 - 15 = 88 cakes left.
Response:  We know that the baker has made 126 cookies and 48 cakes. He sold 115 cookies and 81 cakes. To find out how many more cookies he made than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made. So, if he made 48 cakes and sold 81 cakes, then he sold 81 - 48 = 33 more cakes than he made. Now, let's do the same for cookies. If he made 126 cookies and sold 115 cookies, then he sold 115 - 126 = -11 fewer cookies than he made. Therefore, the baker made 33 more cakes than cookies.
"Response:  We know that the baker has made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, we can find out how much more pastries he made than cakes. To do this, let's subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made:

19 - 70 = 11

So, the baker made 11 more pastries than cakes. Now, let's divide the number of pastries he made (131) by the number of pastries he sold (88):

131 / 88 = 1.5

Therefore, the baker made 1.5 times more pastries than cakes."
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 147 pieces of bread and 158 pieces of cake. To find out how many more cakes were sold than bread, we need to subtract the number of bread sold from the number of cakes sold. So, if we do this, we get:  
158 - 147 = 11  
Therefore, the baker sold 11 more cakes than bread."
Response:  We know that the baker has sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries. To find out how much more pastry he has sold than cake, we need to subtract the number of cakes from the total number of pastries. So, if he has 92 pastries and sells 68, then he has 92 - 68 = 24 more pastries than cakes.
Response:  If the baker had 44 cakes and sold all of them, then he has no more cakes left. So, if he initially had 48 cakes, he must have sold 48 - 44 = 4 cakes. Therefore, the baker still has 4 cakes left.
"Response:  We know that the baker had 8 cakes for sale and he made 40 cakes in total. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold (8) from the total number of cakes he made (40), we get:

40 - 8 = 32

So, the baker made 32 more cakes than what he sold."
Response:  If the butcher had 137 cows at first and he made 169 cows in total, then we can subtract the number of cows he already had from the total number of cows to find out how many more cows he has now. So, if he started with 137 cows and made 169 cows, that means he has 169 - 137 = 32 more cows now.
"Response:  We know that Bakker has made 173 cakes and he has sold 103 of them. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he has sold from the total number of cakes he has made, we can find out how many cakes he still has.

173 - 103 =?

The difference is 70. Therefore, Bakker still has 70 cakes left."
"Response:  We know that the baker has bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes. So, to find out how many more cakes he has bought than what he has sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he has sold from the number of cakes he has bought.

167 - 89 =?

Can you solve for the difference?"
"Response:  We know that the baker has made 8 new cakes and bought 139 new cakes. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he bought from the total number of cakes he sold, we can find out how many more cakes he sold than what he bought.  
145 (total sales) - 139 (purchases) = 6  
Therefore, the baker sold 6 more cakes than what he purchased."
Response:  We know that the baker has made 62 cookies and sold 144 of them. So, he has 62 - 144 = 80 cookies left.
Response:  We know that the baker made 81 cookies at first and then he made 92 more. So in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cookies. But we also know that he sold 46 of them. Therefore, the number of cookies he did not sell is 173 - 46 = 127. So the baker made 127 more cookies than what he sold.
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 108 cookies and 44 cakes. So, if we subtract the number of items he has sold from the total number of items he had, we can find out how many items are left with him.

Total number of cookies = 61 + 167 = 228
Total number of cakes = 44

Number of cookies sold = 108
Number of cakes sold = 44

Now, let's subtract the number of items sold from the total number of items:

Cookies remaining = 228 - 108 = 120
Cakes remaining = 44 - 44 = 0 (he has sold all the cakes)

So, the baker still has 120 cookies left with him."
"Response:  We know that the baker has 56 baked goods and 124 cookies in total. If he sold 104 cookies and 29 baked goods, we can calculate how many baked goods are left using subtraction.

124 - 29 =?

The result is 95. So, the baker still has 95 baked goods left."
"Response:  We know that the baker has made 52 cakes and 84 cookies. If he sold 102 cookies and 94 cakes, we can start by finding out how many more cookies he sold than cakes. To do this, subtract the number of cakes from the total number of cookies:

102 - 84 = 18

So, the baker sold 18 more cookies than cakes. Now, let's find out how many more cakes he sold than cookies. To do this, subtract the number of cookies from the total number of cakes:

94 - 84 = 10

So, the baker sold 10 more cakes than cookies. Therefore, the baker sold 18 more cookies than cakes and 10 more cakes than cookies."
"Response:  We know that baker made 134 cakes and 11 cookies. He sold 140 cakes and 92 cookies. So we can start by subtracting what he sold from what he made to find out how much more of each item he has left over.  
For cakes: 140 - 134 = 6  
For cookies: 92 - 11 = 81  
So the baker has 6 more cakes and 81 more cookies than he sold."
"Response:  We know that the baker sold 8 cakes and 97 cookies in total. To find out how many more cookies were sold than cakes, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cookies sold. So, if we do this, we get:  
97 - 8 = 99 more cookies were sold than cakes."
"Response:  We know that the baker sold 154 baked goods and 78 cookies. To find out how much more baked goods he sold than cookies, we need to subtract the number of cookies he sold from the total number of baked goods he sold. So, if we do this, we get:  
154 - 78 =?  
Do you want me to calculate it for you or would you like to try it yourself?"
Response:  If Kelly has 22 games and wants to have 140 more, then she needs to buy 140 - 22 = 118 more games.
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she wants to get rid of 64 of them, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 games left.
Response:  If Kelly had 91 games and she got rid of all of them, then she had zero games left (0). So, if she started with 92 games and tried to get rid of them all, she would have ended up with zero games left.
"Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and wants to have 12 Nintendo games, she needs to get rid of 8 Nintendo games. Since she also has 70 Sony games, we can assume that she will keep all her Sony games. Therefore, the final number of Nintendo games Kelly will have is 20 - 8 = 12."""
Response:  If Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games, then she has a total of 46 + 132 = 178 games. To get 31 Sony games, she needs to give away 132 - 31 = 101 games.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 more, then she has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. To find out how many games she needs to get rid of to have 6 fewer, we can subtract 6 from 111: 111 - 6 = 105. So Kelly needs to get rid of 105 games.
"Response:  We know that Randy had 52 blocks and he used 38 of them to build a tower. So, we can start by subtracting 38 from 52:

52 - 38 =?

That gives us:

14

So, Randy had 14 blocks at the beginning."
Response:  If Randy has 97 blocks and he needs 72 to build a tower, then he will have 97 - 72 = 25 blocks left over after building the tower. So, Randy will use 72 blocks to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total and he used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So we can subtract the number of blocks he used from the total number of blocks he had:

79 - 14 =? (subtracting 14 from 79)

79 - 11 =? (subtracting 11 from 79)

Now let's add the two equations together:

79 - 14 + 79 - 11 =?

Adding the two equations gives us:

65 + 68 = 133

So there are 133 blocks left for Randy to use."
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he uses 27 blocks to build a tower. That means he has 58 - 27 = 31 blocks left. Now we know that he uses 53 blocks to build a house. So the total number of blocks used to build both the tower and the house is 31 + 53 = 84 blocks.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks in total and he used 33 of them to build a tower and 13 of them to build a house. So we can start by subtracting the number of blocks he used for the house from the total number of blocks he had:

37 - 13 =?

That gives us:

37 - 13 = 24

So Randy has 24 blocks left over after building both structures. To find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used for the house from the number of blocks he used for the tower:

33 - 13 =?

That gives us:

33 - 13 = 20

Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks in total and he used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many more blocks he used for building the house than for building the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, we can say:

82 - 79 = 3

Therefore, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than to build the tower."
Response:  If Randy had 59 blocks and used 36 of them to build a tower, then he has 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks in total and he used 20 blocks to build a house. So, how many blocks does he have left?

We can calculate this by subtracting the number of blocks he used for the house from the total number of blocks he had:

95 - 20 = 75

So, Randy has 75 blocks left. Now, we need to find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than the house. To do this, we can compare the number of blocks he used for each structure:

20 (for the house) vs. 50 (for the tower)

Since the number of blocks he used for the tower is greater than the number of blocks he used for the house, we can say that he used more blocks to build the tower than the house. Specifically, he used 50 - 20 = 30 more blocks to build the tower than the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total and he used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So we can start by subtracting the number of blocks he used for each structure from the total number of blocks he had:

90 - 89 = 1 (number of blocks left over for building the tower)

Now let's compare the number of blocks Randy used for each structure:

89 (blocks used for the house) > 63 (blocks used for the tower)

This means that Randy used more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower. Specifically, he used 26 more blocks to build the house (89 - 63)."
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have already read 5 of them, then you have only read half of the total number of books (20/2 = 10). So, you have not yet read 10 books from the series.
Response:  If you have read 13 books and still need to read 8 more, then the total number of books in the series is 13 + 8 = 21 books.
Response:  If there are 22 books and you have read 12 of them, then you still need to read 22 - 12 = 10 more books.
Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, that means you still need to watch 10 more movies (17 - 7 = 10).
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, we can compare the number of books to the number of movies.

Number of books = 19
Number of movies = 13

To find out how many more books than movies there are, we subtract the number of movies from the number of books:

Number of books - Number of movies =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies, we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series. To do this, we need to subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of books. Then, we divide the result by the number of books to find out how much more there is. Here's the calculation:

Total number of books = 8
Number of books read = 19
Subtracting the number of books read from the total number of books gives us:

8 - 19 = -11

Now, let's divide the result by the total number of books:

-11 / 8 = -1.375 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, there are approximately 1.375 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
Response:  If you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, we can start by comparing the number of books to the number of movies. You have read more books than movies. Specifically, you have read 13 - 12 = 1 more book than movie.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in total. If you have read 7 of the books and watched 21 of the movies, we can start by comparing the number of books to the number of movies you have consumed.

Books: 7 (number of books you have read) / 11 (total number of books) = 0.63 or approximately 63%

Movies: 21 (number of movies you have watched) / 17 (total number of movies) = 1.24 or approximately 124%

So, you have watched more movies than you have read books. Specifically, you have watched 21/17 = 124% of all the movies, while you have only read 7/11 = 63% of all the books."
Response:  If there are 14 books in total and you have already read 8 of them, then you still need to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6).
"Response:  We know that there are 62 books and 19 books have been read already. So we need to find out how many more books should be read. To do this, we can subtract the number of books that have been read from the total number of books available.

So, if we subtract 19 (the number of books that have been read) from 62 (the total number of books), we get:

62 - 19 =?

The answer is 43. Therefore, you still need to read 43 more books."
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, that means you still need to watch 4 more movies to complete the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different movies and 15 different books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 11 books and watched 40 movies, we can calculate how many more books than movies there are in the series.

Let x be the number of books you have not read (x = 11 - 4).

We know that there are 15 books in total, so we can write an equation:

15 - x = 40

Now solve for x:

x = 15 - 40

x = 15 + 4

x = 19

Therefore, there are 19 more books than movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 different movies and 11 books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies, we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series.

Let x be the number of books. Since you have read 13 books, x = 13.

Let y be the number of movies. Since you have watched 63 movies, y = 63.

Now, let's compare the number of books to the number of movies:

x (books) = 13
y (movies) = 63

To find out how many more movies than books there are, we subtract the number of books from the number of movies:

y - x = 63 - 13 = 50

So, there are 50 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 14 of the movies and 19 of the books, we can start by comparing the number of books you have read to the total number of books available. There are 10 books in total, so if you have read 19 of them, you have read 19/10 = 190% of all the books. Now let's compare the number of movies you have watched to the total number of movies available. There are 6 movies in total, so if you have watched 14 of them, you have watched 14/6 = 233% of all the movies. Therefore, you have read more books than movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series. If you have read 19 of the movies and 16 of the books, we can start by comparing how many more movies you have read than books.

To do this, we need to subtract the number of books you have read (16) from the number of movies you have read (19):

19 - 16 = 3

So, you have read 3 more movies than books."
Response:  We know that Dave had 7 cards and he used 2 to buy toys. So, if we subtract 2 from 7, we get 5. Therefore, Dave had 5 cards left after buying the toys.
"Response:  We know that Dave has 12 cards and he used some of them to buy toys. So, if he had x cards left, he would have used (12 - x) cards to buy toys. Since he bought 14 toys, we can set up the equation as follows:

12 - x = 14

Now, let's solve for x. To do this, we need to add 12 to both sides of the equation:

12 - x + 12 = 14 + 12

This simplifies to:

x = 26

So, Dave had 26 cards at the arcade."
"Response:  We know that Dave has 18 cards and he used 5 to buy toys. So, how many cards does Dave have left? To find out, we can subtract the number of cards he used from the total number of cards he had:

18 - 5 = 13

So, Dave has 13 cards left."
"Response:  We know that Dave has 19 cards in total and he used 12 of them to buy toys and 7 of them to buy clothes. So, we can start by finding out how many cards Dave used to buy each type of item.

For toys: Dave used 12/19 = 63% of his cards to buy toys.

For clothes: Dave used 7/19 = 37% of his cards to buy clothes.

Now, let's find out how many more cards Dave used for buying clothes compared to toys. To do this, we need to subtract the percentage of cards used for toys from the percentage of cards used for clothes.

37% - 63% =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Dave has 13 cards and he used 8 of them to buy toys. So, he has 13 - 8 = 5 cards left. Now, we are asked how many more cards did Dave use to buy clothes than toys. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of cards he used for toys from the total number of cards he had left. So, we can say:

5 (cards left) - 8 (used for toys) =? (more cards used for clothes)

Solving for the unknown variable, we get:

5 - 8 = 7

So, Dave used 7 more cards to buy clothes than toys."
Response:  If Dave has 14 cards and lost 2, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 cards left. If he used 10 of them to buy toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 cards left.
Response:  If 9 birds died and 14 survived, then we can say that 9 + 14 = 23 birds were present initially. Now, if a tornado killed 9 birds, it means that only 23 - 9 = 14 birds survived. So, more than 9 birds (specifically, 14) survived the tornado.
Response:  If there were initially 13 birds in the backyard and 6 died during the storm, then there would be 13 - 6 = 7 birds left alive after the storm. So, the number of birds that survived the storm is 7.
Response:  If Haley had 20 tomatoes in her backyard and after the storm, only 4 were left, then we can deduce that 16 tomatoes (20 - 4 = 16) were destroyed or damaged during the storm.
Response:  If Haley had 5 tomato plants before the storm and only 12 survived after the storm, then she lost 5 - 12 = 3 plants due to the storm. So, she grew 3 more plants after the storm.
Response:  If Haley had 9 tomatoes in her backyard and 4 were destroyed by a storm, then she has 9 - 4 = 5 tomatoes left.
Response:  If Hayley had 12 bees initially and 2 bees died during the storm, then she has 12 - 2 = 10 bees left.
Response:  If Haley had initially grown three trees and 13 trees survived the hurricane, then we can assume that she grew 10 more trees (13 - 3 = 10) before the hurricane hit. So, in total, 13 + 10 = 23 trees were grown by Haley.
Response:  If there were initially 11 birds in the backyard and 2 died during the storm, then we have to subtract 2 from 11 to find out how many birds survived. So, if 2 birds died, then 11 - 2 = 9 birds survived the storm.
"Response:  We know that each sack contains 28 lemons and they sell 66 sacks per day. So, to find out how many lemons they sell per day, we can multiply the number of sacks by the number of lemons in each sack:

66 sacks x 28 lemons/sack = 1,848 lemons/day

Therefore, they sell 1,848 lemons per day."
Response:  If they eat 8 sacks of lemons per day, then they will need 24 sacks in total to eat for one week (7 days x 8 sacks/day).
Response:  We know that there are 56 sacks of lemons in total and they will last for 4 days. So, we need to find out how many sacks of lemons they will use per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of sacks (56) by the number of days (4): 56 / 4 = 14. Therefore, they will use 14 sacks of lemons per day.
Response:  We know that they eat 38 sacks of lemons per day and each sack contains 42 lemons. So, if they eat 38 sacks per day, then they eat 38 x 42 = 1624 lemons per day. Now, we want to find out how many sacks of lemons they will have after 49 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of lemons they eat per day by the number of days they will eat them: 1624 lemons/day x 49 days = 75,040 lemons. Since there are 42 lemons in each sack, we can divide the total number of lemons by the number of lemons in each sack to find out how many sacks they will have: 75,040 lemons / 42 lemons/sack = 1812 sacks. Therefore, after 49 days, they will have eaten 1812 sacks of lemons.
Response:  We know that they produce 66 boxes per day and each box contains 25 lemons. So, in total, they produce 66 x 25 = 1650 lemons per day. To find out how many lemons they will have after 87 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of lemons produced per day: 87 x 1650 = 143,950 lemons.
"Response:  We know that each sack contains 35 lemons and they pack 8 sacks per day. So, to find out how many lemons they pack per day, we need to multiply the number of sacks by the number of lemons in each sack. That gives us:

8 sacks x 35 lemons/sack = 280 lemons/day"
"Response:  We know that each sack contains 57 lemons and they produce 16 sacks per day. So, to calculate how many days it will take to produce 80 sacks of lemons, we need to divide the number of sacks by the daily production.

Number of sacks = 80
Daily production = 16

Now, let's divide:

80 / 16 = 5

Therefore, it will take 5 days to produce 80 sacks of lemons."
"Response:  We know that each bag contains 12 lemons and they sell 67 bags per day. So, if they sell 35 bags, how many lemons will they have sold in total?

We can start by multiplying the number of bags sold (35) by the number of lemons in each bag (12):

35 x 12 =?

Do you see the pattern here?"
"Response:  We know that they produce 74 boxes of lemons per day and discard 71 of them. So, they sell 3 boxes (74 - 71 = 3) of lemons per day. If we want to find out how many boxes of lemons they will have after 51 days, we can multiply the number of days by the number of boxes sold per day:

3 x 51 = 153 boxes of lemons

Therefore, after 51 days, they will have 153 boxes of lemons."
Response:  We know that they produce 76 boxes per day and discard 64 of them. That means they keep 12 boxes per day (76 - 64 = 12). Each box contains 50 lemons, so they have 12 x 50 = 600 lemons per day.
"Response:  If they have 28 ripe lemons and 52 unripe lemons per day, how many ripe lemons will they have in total after 26 days?

To find out, we need to calculate the number of ripe lemons they will have each day for the first 26 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of ripe lemons they have per day (28) by the number of days (1).

So, after 1 day, they will have:

28 x 1 = 28 ripe lemons

After 2 days, they will have:

28 x 2 = 56 ripe lemons

And so on...

After 26 days, they will have:

28 x 26 = 724 ripe lemons

Therefore, after 26 days, they will have 724 ripe lemons."
"Response:  If they produce 82 sacks of ripe lemons and 61 sacks of unripe lemons per day, then in 25 days, they will have produced:

82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of ripe lemons
61 x 25 = 1525 sacks of unripe lemons

Therefore, after 25 days, they will have a total of:

2050 + 1525 = 3575 sacks of lemons."
"Response:  If they have 31 sacks of ripe lemons and 24 sacks of unripe lemons per day, how many sacks of unripened lemons will they have after 45 days of processing?

To find out, we need to calculate how many sacks of ripe lemons they will produce in 45 days. We know that they currently produce 31 sacks per day, so:

31 x 45 = 1495 sacks of ripe lemons

Now, let's subtract the number of sacks of ripe lemons they will have produced from the total number of sacks of unripe lemons they started with:

24 x 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe lemons

Subtracting 1495 from 1080 gives us:

675 sacks of unripe lemons

Therefore, after 45 days of processing, they will have 675 sacks of unripe lemons left."
"Response:  We know that there are 44 sacks of ripe lemons and 25 sacks of unripe lemons produced daily. To find out how many more sacks of ripe lemons are produced than unripe lemons, we need to subtract the number of sacks of unripe lemons from the total number of sacks of lemons produced daily. So, if we subtract 25 from 44, we get:

44 - 25 = 19

Therefore, 19 more sacks of ripe lemons are produced daily than unripe lemons."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 sacks of ripe lemons and 74 sacks of unripe lemons per day. To find out how many more sacks of unripe lemons are produced than ripe lemons, we need to subtract the number of sacks of ripe lemons from the total number of sacks of lemons. So, if we subtract 5 from 74, we get:

74 - 5 = 69

Therefore, there are 69 more sacks of unripe lemons produced per day than ripe lemons."
"Response:  We know that they have plucked 54 baskets of lemons and it takes them 18 baskets per day to process them. So we can start by converting the number of baskets into days:

54 baskets / 18 baskets/day = 3 days

Therefore, it would take them 3 days to process all the lemons they have plucked."
"Response:  We know that they have plucked 56 baskets of lemons in total and they will be squeezing for 14 days. So, we need to find out how many baskets they will be squeezing per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of baskets by the number of days they will be squeezing:

56 baskets / 14 days = 4 baskets per day

Therefore, they will be squeezing 4 baskets of lemons per day."
"Response:  If they have 25 sacks of unripe lemons and 5 sacks of ripe lemons at the beginning, then after 73 days, they will have:

* 25 x (1 + 0.25) ^ 73 = 25 x 1.25^73 = 4687.5 sacks of unripe lemons
* 5 x (1 + 0.25) ^ 73 = 5 x 1.25^73 = 1968.75 sacks of ripe lemons

Therefore, after 73 days, they will have a total of 4687.5 + 1968.75 = 6656.25 sacks of lemons."
"Response:  If they produce 65 sacks of unripe lemons and 46 sacks of ripe lemons per day, then in 6 days, they will have produced:

65 sacks/day x 6 days = 390 sacks of unripe lemons
46 sacks/day x 6 days = 270 sacks of ripe lemons

So, after 6 days, they will have a total of:
390 + 270 = 660 sacks of lemons."
"Response:  We know that there are 41 sacks of unripe lemons and 86 sacks of ripe lemons produced daily. To find out how many more sacks of ripe lemons are produced than unripe ones, we need to subtract the number of sacks of unripe lemons from the number of sacks of ripe lemons. So, if we do this, we get:

86 (ripe) - 41 (unripe) = 45

Therefore, 45 more sacks of ripe lemons are produced daily than unripe ones."
"Response:  We know that there are 71 sacks of unripe lemons and 60 sacks of ripe lemons produced daily. To find out how many more sacks of immature lemons than ripe lemons are produced daily, we need to subtract the number of sacks of ripe lemons from the number of sacks of immature lemons.

So, if we subtract 60 (sacks of ripe lemons) from 71 (sacks of immature lemons), we get:

71 - 60 = 11

Therefore, 11 more sacks of immature lemons are produced daily than ripe lemons."
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, if we subtract 11 from 12, we get... 12 - 11 = 1 foot! That means Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is wide.
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a room with an area of 14 square feet (14 x 10 = 140 square feet). Since we are given that her room is 2 meters long, we can convert this to feet as follows: 

2 meters = 6 feet (since there are 3 feet in a meter)

So, Jesse's room is 6 feet long and she needs it to be 140 square feet in size. To find out what the width of the room must be, we can divide the area by the length:

140 square feet / 6 feet = 23 square feet (width)

Therefore, Jesse's room must be at least 23 square feet wide."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs 14 square feet of space for her camera, and we also know that she wants to keep it within a maximum height of 2 meters (6.5 feet). So, let's start by converting the area from square feet to square meters:

14 square feet = 0.13 square meters (since there are 9 square feet in 1 square meter)

Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the length of the room:

Area = Length x Width

Since we know the width (2 meters), we can solve for the length:

Length = Area / Width
= 0.13 square meters / 2 meters
= 0.065 meters (or approximately 65 centimeters)

So, the length of Jesse's camera room would be approximately 65 centimeters or 2 meters minus 65 centimeters, which is approximately 1.35 meters."
"Response:  We know that Jessie has already covered 16 square feet of the floor with tape. So we need to find out how much more area she needs to cover. The size of the room is given as 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. To calculate the total area of the room, we multiply the length and width:

11 x 15 = 165 square feet

Since Jessie has already covered 16 square feet, we subtract that from the total area of the room to find out how much more area she needs to cover:

165 - 16 = 149 square feet

So Jessie needs to cover an additional 149 square feet of the floor with tape."
Response:  We know that each tile measures 4 square feet and we want to cover the entire floor which has an area of 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. So, we need 24/4 = 6 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that each room has an area of $19 \text{ feet} \times 18 \text{ feet} = 324 \text{ square feet}$. Since there are $20$ rooms in total, we need to cover an area of $324 \text{ square feet} \times 20 = 6480 \text{ square feet}$ with flooring material.
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long. To find out how much longer her room is than its width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, if we subtract 19 from 20, we get:  
20 - 19 = 1 foot  
So, Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is wide."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs 10 square feet of material to cover her room and we also know that her room is 5 feet long. So, if we can find out the width of her room, we will be able to calculate the area she needs.

Let's assume the width of her room is x feet. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:

Area = Length x Width

In this case, the length is 5 feet (given) and we want to find the width, so we can substitute 5 for the length in our equation:

Width x 5 = 10

Now, we can solve for the width:

Width = 10 / 5

Width = 2

So, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet. Now, let's calculate the area:

Area = 5 x 2

Area = 10

Therefore, the area of Jesse's room is 10 square feet."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs 10 square feet of material to cover her room and we also know that her room is 2 feet wide. To find out how long her room is, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle which is length x width = area. Since she needs 10 square feet of material, we set up an equation:

2 x (length) = 10

Solving for length, we get:

Length = 5

So Jesse's room is 5 feet long."
"Response:  We know that Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet and her room measures 4 feet in length and 20 feet in width. To find out how much more carpet she needs to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of the room first. The formula for finding the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where A is the area and L and W are the lengths and widths respectively. In this case, the length (L) is 4 feet and the width (W) is 20 feet. So, the area of the room is:
A = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet
Now, let's compare the amount of carpet Jessie has with the area of the room:
Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet
The area of the room is 80 square feet
So, Jessie needs 80 - 18 = 62 square feet more carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt winkel makes $23 per each T-shirt sold and they have made $230 during the Arkansas and Texas Tech football game. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the number of T-shirts sold. Then, we can write:

23x = 230... (1)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can divide both sides of the equation by 23:

x = 230 / 23... (2)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 9

So, the Razorback T-shirt winkel has sold 9 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech football game."
"Response:  We know that the total revenue from selling 3 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game was $51 dollars. To find out the cost of each T-shirt, we can divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold: 
$51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt sells for $87 per unit and they sold 95 units during both the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game. During the Arkansas game, they sold 47 units. So, we can calculate how much money they made from the Arkansas game as follows:

Total revenue from Arkansas game = Number of units x Price per unit
= 47 x $87
= $3,969

Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt maker made $3,969 from the Arkansas game."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt winkel makes $106 per T-shirt sold and they sold 242 T-shirts during the Arkansas-Wedstryd and Texas Tech-wedstryd. So, we can calculate how many T-shirts they sold during each game by dividing the total number of T-shirts sold by two:

242 T-shirts / 2 = 121 T-shirts sold during each game

Therefore, they sold 121 T-shirts during the Texas Tech wedstryd."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt sells for $98 per unit and they sold 163 units during both the Arkansas-Wedstryd and Texas Tech-Wedstryd games. During the Arkansas-Wedstryd game alone, they sold 89 units. So we can calculate how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas-Wedstryd game as follows:

Total revenue from Arkansas-Wedstryd game = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per unit
= 89 x $98
= $8,722

Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt maker made $8,722 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas-Wedstryd game."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt winkel makes $78 per T-shirt sold and they sold 186 T-shirts during the Arkansas-Wedstryd game. So, we can calculate how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas-Wedstryd game as follows:

$78 x 186 = $14,392

Now, let's find out how much money they would have made if they had sold 172 T-shirts during the Texas Tech-Wedstryd game instead of 186. To do this, we can subtract the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas-Wedstryd game (186) from the total number of T-shirts sold during both games (172 + 186):

172 + 186 - 186 = 172 + 0 = 172

So, the Razorback T-shirt winkel would have made $78 x 172 = $13,576 if they had sold 172 T-shirts during the Texas Tech-Wedstryd game instead of 186."
"Response:  We know that the Razorbacks sold 183 T-shirts and 31 truis during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. The price of each T-shirt is $62, so we can calculate how much money they made from selling T-shirts as follows:

$62 x 183 = $11,466

The price of each trui is $99, so we can calculate how much money they made from selling truies as follows:

$99 x 31 = $3,099

In total, the Razorbacks made $11,466 + $3,099 = $14,565 from selling T-shirts and truies during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response:  We know that the Razorbacks made $67 per T-shirt and $165 per jersey. During the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jerseys. To find out how much money they made from selling jerseys, we can multiply the number of jerseys sold (156) by the price per jersey ($165):

$165 x 156 = $26,390

To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts, we can multiply the number of T-shirts sold (74) by the price per T-shirt ($67):

$67 x 74 = $5,088

Adding both amounts together gives us the total amount of money the Razorbacks made from selling merchandise during the game:

$26,390 + $5,088 = $31,478"
"Response:  We know that the Razorbacks sold 157 T-shirts and 19 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. The price of each T-shirt is $192, so the total revenue from T-shirts is:

157 x $192 = $28,604

The price of each trui is $34, so the total revenue from truis is:

19 x $34 = $636

To find out how much more the T-shirts cost than the truis, we need to subtract the total revenue from truis from the total revenue from T-shirts:

$28,604 - $636 = $27,968

So, the T-shirts cost $27,968 more than the truis."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback sells t-shirts for $86 each and truis for $232 each. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 truis. To find out how much more the truis cost than the t-shirts, we need to subtract the price of the t-shirts from the price of the truis. So, let's do that:

$232 - $86 = $146

So, the truis cost $146 more than the t-shirts."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirts were sold for $51 each and there was an 8% discount offered during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. So, we can start by calculating the original price of each T-shirt before the discount.  
$51 = $51 / (1 - 0.08)  
$51 = $64.29  
So, the original price of each T-shirt before the discount was $64.29. Now, let's calculate how much money they made from selling 130 T-shirts.  
$64.29 x 130 = $8,272.70  
Therefore, they made $8,272.70 from selling 130 T-shirts."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirts were sold for $201 each during the Arkansas and Texas Tech games. If they sold 14 T-shirts, we can calculate how much money they made as follows:

14 x $201 = $2,844

So, they made $2,844 from selling the T-shirts during those two games."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback T-shirt store made $60 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. They earned $10 profit per each T-shirt sold. So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the number of T-shirts sold. Then, we have:

Profit = 10x (since they earned $10 profit per T-shirt)
Total Revenue = Profit + Cost (we assume the cost price of one T-shirt is zero)

Now we are given that Total Revenue = $60. Therefore, we can solve for x as follows:

$60 = 10x + 0
$60 - 0 = 10x
$60 = 10x

To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we divide both sides by 10:

x = $\dfrac{60}{10}$
x = 6

Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt store sold 6 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response:  We know that the total revenue of the Razorback T-shirt store was $215 and they sold 5 T-shirts. So we can calculate the cost of each T-shirt as follows:

Total Revenue = $215
Number of T-shirts Sold = 5
Cost per T-shirt = Total Revenue / Number of T-shirts Sold
= $215 / 5
= $43

Therefore, the cost of each T-shirt is $43."
"Response:  We know that the Razorbacks sold 20 T-shirts and 64 shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. The price of each T-shirt is $215, so they made:

$215 x 20 = $4,300 from selling T-shirts.

We also know that the Razorbacks sold 64 shirts at $5 per shirt, so they made:

$5 x 64 = $320 from selling t-shirts.

Therefore, the total amount of money the Razorbacks made from selling both T-shirts and truis $4,300 + $320 = $4,620."
"Response:  We know that the Razorbacks sold 158 T-shirts and 2 jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. The price of each T-shirt is $204, so the total revenue from T-shirt sales is:

158 x $204 = $31,992

The price of each jersey is $76, so the total revenue from jersey sales is:

2 x $76 = $152

Therefore, the total revenue from all sales is:

$31,992 + $152 = $32,144"
"Response:  We know that the Razorback sells t-shirts for $240 each and truis for $210 each. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 truies. To find out how much more the t-shirts cost than the truies, we need to subtract the price of the truies from the price of the t-shirts. So, let's do that:

$240 (t-shirt) - $210 (trui) = $30 per t-shirt

Now, we need to multiply this difference by the number of t-shirts sold:

$30 x 177 = $5,310

So, the t-shirts made $5,310 more than the truies during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game."
"Response:  We know that the Razorback sells t-shirts for $25 each and truis for $115 each. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 truies. To find out how much more the truies cost than the t-shirts, we need to subtract the price of the t-shirts from the price of the truies. So, let's do that:

$115 (price of truies) - $25 (price of t-shirts) = $90

So, the truies cost $90 more than the t-shirts."
Response:  If they have 5 star tables and each table has 10 chairs, then they have a total of 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. But if they want to host a party with 20 more chairs than tables, then they will need 20 + 50 = 70 chairs in total.
Response:  We know that there are 12 chairs in total and two tables with the same number of chairs. So we can say that each table has 6 chairs (12/2 = 6).
Response:  If there are 9 stools in total and each table has 3 stools, then we can set up an equation to represent this information. We know that 9 = 3 x (number of tables). So, we can solve for the number of tables as follows: 9 = 3x, divide both sides by 3, and solve for x. X = 3. Therefore, there are three tables with 9 stools in total.
Response:  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then they have a total of 11 x 13 = 143 chairs. Since they need to accommodate 100 guests, they will have 143 - 100 = 43 extra chairs in their backyard.
Response:  If there are 11 people sitting at each table and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs occupied would be 11 x 6 = 66. So, the number of empty chairs would be 10 - 66 = 4.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 tables and each table has 14 chairs. So, we can start by calculating how many chairs there are in total:

12 x 14 = 168 chairs

Now, we need to add the extra chairs. There are 6 extra chairs, so let's add them to our total:

168 + 6 = 174 chairs

Therefore, there will be 174 chairs available for guests at the party."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 people attending the party and each table has three chairs. So, to calculate how many more chairs they need, we can subtract the number of chairs at each table from the total number of people attending the party. In this case, we have:

Total number of people = 14
Number of chairs per table = 3

So, to find out how many more chairs they need, we can subtract the number of chairs per table from the total number of people:

14 - (3 x 4) = 14 - 12 = 2

Therefore, they need two more chairs."
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for each table and they have 9 tables, then they have a total of 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. Since they need more than 126 chairs, the correct answer is 126 + (number of additional chairs needed).
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $460 over 5 weeks. So, if we divide $460 by 5, we get the average amount he earned per week:

$460 ÷ 5 = $92 per week

Therefore, Lewis earned $92 per week for 5 weeks."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the period and he earns $16 per week. So, if we divide $1216 by $16, we get:

$1216 ÷ $16 =?

Do you want to try it yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, so he earns a total of:

$21 x 216 = $4592

Now, we need to subtract the tax he pays, which is $702. So, his final amount at the end of the season will be:

$4592 - $702 = $3890"
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $1357 per week during the 223 weeks of an oes season. To find out how much he will earn in 73 oese seasons, we need to multiply the number of weeks he works in one season by the number of seasons he works. So, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:

Total Earnings = Number of Weeks x Weekly Earning
= 223 x $1357
= $309,411

Therefore, Lewis will earn $309,411 if he works for 73 oese seasons."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $28 per week for 1091 weeks, which is equal to $28 x 1091 = $31,568. Additionally, he earns $939 per week for overtime work during the season, so his total earnings for the season would be $31,568 + $939 = $32,477.
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $403 every week for 233 weeks, so he earns a total of:

$403 x 233 = $91,590

Now, if he pays $49 per week in rent, he will pay a total of:

$49 x 233 = $11,277

So, Lewis will have earned $91,590 - $11,277 = $80,313 during the season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks, which is equal to:

$368 x 1359 = $497,222

Now, we need to calculate how much he pays in rent each week and over the entire season. If he pays $388 per week in rent, then:

Rent per week = $388

To find out how much he pays in rent over the entire season, we multiply the rent per week by the number of weeks in the season:

Total rent = Rent per week x Number of weeks
= $388 x 1359
= $507,392

So, Lewis pays $507,392 in rent over the entire season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $491 per week for 1181 weeks, which is equal to:

$491 x 1181 = $570,391

Now, we need to subtract the amount he spends on rent each week, which is $216. So, the total amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the season is:

$570,391 - $216 x 1181 = $570,391 - $252,816 = $317,575

Therefore, Lewis will have $317,575 at the end of the season after earning $491 per week for 1181 weeks and paying $216 in rent each week."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $133 in 19 weeks. So, if we divide $133 by 19, we get an average weekly earnings of:

$133 ÷ 19 = $6.95 per week"
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $2 per week and he has earned a total of $178. To find out how many weeks it took for him to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his weekly earnings: $178 ÷ $2 = 89 weeks.
"Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet tall and the depth of the water is 10 times his height. So if we set up an equation based on this information, we can solve for the depth of the water. Here's the equation:

Depth = 10 x Height

Now we just need to plug in the value for Height, which is 9 feet or 108 inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot).

Depth = 10 x 108

Depth = 1080 inches

Since there are 36 inches in a yard, we can convert the measurement from inches to yards like this:

Depth = 1080 / 36

Depth = 30 yards

So the water is 30 yards deep!"
"Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron stands at 14 feet, then Dean stands at 6 feet (14 - 8 = 6). Now we need to find out how deep the water is based on this height. Since the depth of the water is twice Dean's height, we can set up an equation using ""d"" for depth and ""h"" for height. d = 2h So, d = 2(6) = 12 feet The water is 12 feet deep."
Response:  We know that Ron is 12 feet tall and Dean is 11 feet shorter than him. So, if we subtract 11 from 12, we get 1 foot (12 - 11 = 1). Therefore, Dean is one foot taller than Ron. Now, we are told that the depth of the water is five times Ron's height. So, if we multiply 12 by 5, we get 60 feet (12 x 5 = 60). That means the water is 60 feet deep!
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet longer than Ron, so if Ron stands at 13 feet, then Dean would stand at 13 + 4 = 17 feet. Now we are given that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, so the depth of the water would be 15 x 17 = 255 feet deep.
"Response:  We know that Ron is 9 feet shorter than Dean and the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. So if we let R be Ron's height, then the depth of the water is 16R. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, Dean's height is 9 + R. Now we are given that when Ron stands at 13 feet, the water is deep enough to cover him completely. So we can set up the equation:

16R = 13 + R

Simplifying this equation, we get:

16R = 14R

Solving for R, we get:

R = 7

So Ron's height is 7 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water is 16 x 7 = 112 feet."
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 feet long and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean is 9 feet shorter than Ron (since 6 x 2 = 9). Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height, which is 9 x 6 = 54 feet deep.
"Response:  We know that Brian has 34 books and he wants to distribute them equally among two bookshelves. So, we need to divide 34 by 2.

34 ÷ 2 =?

The result of this division is...

34 ÷ 2 = 17

So, there will be 17 books in each bookshelf."
Response:  We know that Brian has written 42 books and each book contains two chapters. So we can start by asking how many chapters Brian has written in total. Can you calculate that for us?
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves, then he has a total of 27 x 23 = 619 books. Additionally, he has 80 x 23 = 1840 magazines. In total, Brian has 619 + 1840 = 2459 items.
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book contains 46 magazines, then he has a total of 9 x 46 = 354 magazines.
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has a total of 23 x 29 = 673 books and 61 x 29 = 1849 magazines. In total, Brian has 673 + 1849 = 2522 items.
Response:  We know that Brian has 7 bookshelves with an equal number of books on each shelf. If he has a total of 28 books, then we can start by finding out how many books are on each shelf. Since there are 7 bookshelves and each shelf has the same number of books, we can say that each shelf has 28/7 = 4 books.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookrack contains two books, then he has 38 / 2 = 19 bookracks.
"Response:  We know that each package contains two invitations, and Carol wants to send one package to each of her 10 friends. So she needs to calculate how many packages she should buy so that no friend is left out.

To do this, we can use division. If Carol has 10 friends and each package contains 2 invitations, then she needs to divide 10 by 2 to find out how many packages she needs:

10 ÷ 2 = 5

So Carol needs to buy 5 packages to make sure all her friends receive an invitation."
Response:  We know that Carol has 12 friends and she bought three packages of invitations. Since each package contains the same number of invitations, we can say that each package contains 12 / 3 = 4 invitations. Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  We know that Carol has ten invitations in each package and she bought six packages. So, if we multiply ten by six, we get 60 invitations. Now, if she sends two invitations to each of her two friends, then she will have used up 4 invitations (2 x 2 = 4). Therefore, the number of invitations left over is 60 - 4 = 56.
Response:  We know that Carol has 14 invitations in total and she bought 6 packs of invitations. That means she has 14 - 6 = 8 extra invitations left. Since she also bought 11 extra invitations, we can add 11 + 8 = 19 extra invitations. So, Carol can invite 19 friends in addition to the 6 packs she already purchased.
Response:  We know that each package contains three invitations and Carol has bought two packages. So she has already received six invitations (2 x 3 = 6). If she wants to send nine invitations in total, she will need to buy an additional three invitations (9 - 6 = 3).
Response:  If Melissa has 12 points in each match and she has achieved 36 points in total, then we can conclude that she has played 3 matches (36 points / 12 points per match = 3 matches).
Response:  We know that Melissa has played three matches and scored a total of 81 points. If we divide 81 by 3, we get an average of 27 points per match. So, Melissa scored 27 points in each match.
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each wrestle and received 82 bonus points in each wrestle. To find out how many points she has accumulated in 79 wrestles, we need to multiply her score per wrestle (109) by the number of wrestles (79). So, the calculation would be:

109 x 79 = 8,601

Therefore, Melissa has accumulated 8,601 points in 79 wrestles."
"Response:  We know that Melissa has scored 21 points in two games and she scores 7 points per game. So we can start by finding out how many games she played. 
We can do this by dividing her total score (21) by her average score per game (7): 
21 / 7 = 3 
So Melissa played three games."
Response:  We know that Melissa has scored a total of 91 points and she has played 13 rounds. So, if we divide 91 by 13, we get an average score per round of 7 points. Therefore, Melissa scores 7 points in each round.
"Response:  We know that there are four seats at the giant swing ride in Paradise Park, and we want to find out how many people can sit at each seat simultaneously. Since there are 20 people who can ride the attraction at the same time, we can start by dividing 20 by 4.

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, five people can sit at each seat simultaneously."
"Response:  We know that each seat can accommodate 9 people, and there are 18 people who want to ride the Ferris wheel at the same time. So we need to find out how many groups of 9 people we can make with 18 people.

We can start by dividing 18 by 9:

18 / 9 = 2

So we can make 2 groups of 9 people each. But wait, we still have one person left over!

Solution: The Ferris wheel has 3 seats available (2 x 9 = 18)."
"Response:  We know that each giant Ferris wheel has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, the total number of people that one Ferris wheel can hold is:

19 x 15 = 285 people

Since there are 20 Ferris wheels, we can multiply the total number of people that one wheel can hold by 20 to find out how many people all 20 wheels can hold:

285 x 20 = 5700 people

Therefore, 20 giant Ferris wheels can hold 5700 people at the same time."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So, if 10 seats are broken, we need to find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.

Let X represent the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once. Since 10 seats are broken, we have 18 - 10 = 8 functional seats left.

Now, let Y represent the number of people who can fit in one seat. Since each seat can accommodate 15 people, we have Y = 15.

So, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is:
X × Y = X × 15

We want to find out what value of X will give us the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once. To do this, we need to maximize the expression X × 15.

Maximizing X × 15 gives us:
Maximum value = 15 × 15 = 225

Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 225."
"Response:  We know that each seat can accommodate 14 people, and there are 6 seats in total. So, we can start by calculating how many people each seat can hold:

6 seats x 14 people/seat = 84 people

Now, we know that 16 people are already on the wheel. So, if we subtract the number of people who are already on the wheel from the total capacity of the seats, we get:

84 people - 16 people = 68 people

Therefore, up to 68 people can still board the wheel."
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats on the giant wheel in Paradise Park. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit on the small seats. Now let's calculate how many people can fit on the large seats. There are 23 large seats, each of which can hold 54 people, so we have 23 x 54 = 1268 people who can fit on the large seats. In total, then, we have 28 + 1268 = 1296 people who can ride on the giant wheel at one time.
Response:  We know that each small seat can accommodate 16 people and there are three small seats. So, we have 3 x 16 = 48 people who can sit on the small seats. Now, let's look at the large seats. There are seven of them, and each one can accommodate 12 people. So, we have 7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit on the large seats. In total, we have 48 + 84 = 132 people who can ride on the big wheel.
Response:  If there are 16 people and each ride has four seats, then we can fill one ride with four people. So, we have 16/4 = 4 rides. Each ride can seat four people, so we have 4 x 4 = 16 people who can ride at the same time.
"Response:  If four people can ride the giant Ferris wheel at the same time, and each seat can accommodate two people, then we need to find out how many seats are available on the Ferris wheel.

Let X be the number of seats on the Ferris wheel. Since each seat can accommodate two people, we know that X/2 represents the total number of riders who can ride the Ferris wheel at once.

We are given that four people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously, so we can set up the equation:

X/2 = 4

Solving for X, we get:

X = 8

Therefore, there are eight seats on the Ferris wheel."
"Response:  We know that each pizza has the same number of slices and there are 14 slices in total. So we can start by dividing 14 by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many slices are in each pizza. Can you do that for us?"""
"Response:  If each pizza has 2 slices and there are 28 slices in total, then we can calculate how many pizzas we need as follows:

28 slices / 2 slices per pizza = 14 pizzas

So, we need to order 14 pizzas."
"Response:  We have 25 people and each pizza has 4 slices. So we need to calculate how many pizzas we can order based on the number of slices per person.

25 people x 4 slices/person = 100 slices

Since each pizza has 4 slices, we can order 100/4 = 25 pizzas."
Response:  If there are 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then in total there will be 9 x 10 = 90 slices of pizza. Since there are 2 people sharing the pizza, each person will get half of the total number of slices, which is 90 / 2 = 45 slices of pizza.
"Response:  We know that there are 45 flower beds and each bed has ten seeds. So we can start by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of seeds per bed:

45 x 10 = 450

So, they have planted 450 seeds in total."
"Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 45 seeds in total. They divided these seeds into 9 flower beds, with each bed containing the same number of seeds (i.e., 45/9 =?). So, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

45 / 9 = x

where x is the number of seeds in each flower bed. Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

So, they planted 5 seeds in each flower bed."
"Response:  We know that they have planted 36 seeds and each seed has grown into either 12 or 58 flowers. So we can start by finding out how many seeds grew into 12 flowers. If 12 seeds grew into 12 flowers, then the remaining 24 seeds (36 - 12 = 24) must have grown into 58 flowers (since there are only 24 seeds left). Therefore, the total number of flower beddings is:

12 x 12 = 144 + 24 x 58 = 1392

So the total number of flower beddings is 144 + 1392 = 1536."
"Response:  We know that they have 55 seeds and each seed is planted in a flower bed with 15 seeds per bed. So, if we divide 55 by 15, we get:

55 / 15 = 3

This means that they have planted 3 beds of flowers. Now, we need to find out how many flowers are in each bed. Since there are 60 seeds in each bed that grow into flowers, we can multiply 3 (the number of beds) by 60 (the number of seeds in each bed):

3 x 60 = 180

So, they have grown 180 flowers in total!"
"Response:  If they have planted 60 seeds and each seed is expected to produce 10 flowers, then we can calculate how many flower beds they would have had as follows:

60 seeds x 10 flowers per seed = 600 flowers
So, they would have had 600 flower beds."
Response:  We know that Paige and her mom planted 32 seeds in total. They divided them equally among 8 flower beds, so each flower bed received 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4).
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 2 crackers and he gave one to each of his 11 friends. So, if we multiply 2 (the number of crackers Matthew had) by 11 (the number of friends), we get:

2 x 11 = 22

So, Matthew had 22 crackers in total."
"Response:  If Matthew gave 8 crackers to his friends and each friend received 2 crackers, then we can calculate how many friends he had as follows:

8 (crackers) / 2 (per friend) = x (number of friends)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

Therefore, Matthew had 4 friends."
Response:  We know that Matthew had 15 cookies and gave an equal number of cookies to each of his 5 friends. So, if we divide 15 by 5, we get... (15 ÷ 5 =)...3! Yes, Matthew gave 3 cookies to each friend. Now, let's find out how many cookies each friend ate. If there were 10 crackers left over after Matthew gave some to his friends, then each friend ate... (10 ÷ 5 =)...2 cookies!
Response:  We know that Matthew had 24 cookies and gave an equal number of cookies to his three friends. So, if he gave each friend the same amount of cookies, then he must have given them 24/3 = 8 cookies each. Therefore, Matthew has 24 - (8 x 3) = 24 - 24 = 0 cookies left.
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies in total. He gave each of his 11 friends an equal number of crackers and cookies. So, if we divide 22 by 11, we get the number of crackers each friend received:

22 / 11 =?

Solution: 22 / 11 = 2

Therefore, each of Matthew's 11 friends received 2 crackers. Now, let's find out how many cookies each friend received. We can do this by dividing 34 by 11:

34 / 11 =?

Solution: 34 / 11 = 3

So, each of Matthew's 11 friends received 3 cookies."
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cookies in total. He gave an equal amount of both to his two friends. So, if he gave x crackers and x cookies to each friend, then the total number of crackers and cookies he gave away would be 2x + 2x = 4x. Since there were only 29 crackers, we can set up the equation as follows:

4x <= 29... (1)

We also know that Matthew had 30 cookies, so the total number of cookies he gave away is also equal to the number of cookies he kept for himself:

2x >= 30... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you solve this system of linear equations to find out how many crackers and cookies each friend received?"
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cookies in total. He gave each of his 7 friends an equal number of crackers and cookies. So, if we divide the total number of crackers and cookies by 7, we can find out how many each person received.

Crackers: 14 / 7 = 2 crackers per friend
Cookies: 21 / 7 = 3 cookies per friend

So, each of Matthew's 7 friends received 2 crackers and 3 cookies."
Response:  If Matthew had 36 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to each of his 18 friends, then he would have given...
Response:  If Matthew had 36 crackers and gave each of his friends 6 crackers, then he would have given out a total of 6 x 6 = 36 crackers. So, Matthew has no more crackers left. Therefore, the number of friends that Matthew has is also 36.
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 23 crackers and he gave an equal amount to his two friends. So, if we divide 23 by 3 (since there are three people), we get:

23 / 3 = 7

So each friend received 7 crackers."
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 crackers and gave away 23 of them to his friends. So, he has 31 - 23 = 8 crackers left.
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 32 crackers and 98 cookies to share among his 4 friends. To find out how many crackers each person will get, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of people sharing them. In this case, we can divide 32 by 4:

32 ÷ 4 =?

The result is:

32 ÷ 4 = 8

So each friend will receive 8 crackers."
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 10 cookies and 8 crackers initially. He gave an equal amount of both to his 4 friends. So, if he gave x cookies and y crackers to each friend, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

x + y = 10 (total number of cookies)
x + y = 8 (total number of crackers)

Now, let's solve for x and y. We can start with the first equation:

x + y = 10

Subtracting y from both sides gives us:

x = 10 - y

Now, substitute this expression for x in the second equation:

(10 - y) + y = 8

Expand and simplify:

9 - y + y = 8

2y = 2

y = 1

Now, substitute y = 1 back into the first equation to find x:

x + 1 = 10

x = 9

So, Matthew gave 9 cookies and 1 cracker to each of his 4 friends."
"Response:  We know that Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cookies to share among his 28 friends. To find out how many crackers and cookies each person got, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cookies by the number of friends.

For the crackers:
13 / 28 =?

For the cookies:
15 / 28 =?

So, each person got:

* 13 / 28 = 0.46 (or approximately 4-5) crackers
* 15 / 28 = 0.53 (or approximately 5-6) cookies"
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought some water bottles and they lasted for 74 days. She drank 109 bottles per day. So we can start by calculating how many bottles she bought in total. 
To do this, we multiply the number of days (74) by the number of bottles per day (109): 
109 x 74 =? 
Can you solve for the answer?"
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought 153 water bottles and she drinks the same number of bottles every day. So, if we divide 153 by the number of days she drank them (which is 17), we can find out how many bottles she drank each day.

153 / 17 =?

Do you want to try solving it yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
Response:  We know that Debbie bought 264 water bottles and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days. So she has drunk 15 x 11 = 165 bottles. Therefore, she still has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left.
"Response:  We know that Debbie had 301 water bottles and she drank 144 bottles over two days. So, we can calculate how many days it took her to drink all the water. To do this, we need to divide the number of bottles she drank (144) by the number of bottles she had (301):

144 / 301 = 0.48

This means that Debbie drank all the water in approximately 0.48 days or about half a day."
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 88 water bottles and 13 soda bottles left after the sale. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles per day, then we can calculate how many days those water bottles will last.

Let's start with the water bottles. If Debbie drinks 4 water bottles per day, and there are 88 water bottles left, then she will have enough water for:

88 / 4 = 22 days

So, Debbie will have enough water for 22 days if she continues to drink 4 water bottles per day.

Now let's look at the soda bottles. If Debbie drinks 87 soda bottles per day, and there are 13 soda bottles left, then she will run out of soda bottles in:

13 / 87 = 0.15 days (or approximately 1 day)

So, Debbie will run out of soda bottles in about 1 day if she continues to drink 87 soda bottles per day."
"Response:  We know that Debbie has 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles. If she drinks 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles per day, then we can calculate how many days the soda bottles will last.

First, let's calculate how many water bottles Debbie drinks per day:

312 water bottles / 1 water bottle = 312 days

Now, let's calculate how many soda bottles Debbie drinks per day:

4 soda bottles / 1 soda bottle = 4 days

So, the soda bottles will last for 4 days."
"Response:  We know that Debbie drank 6 bottles of water in one day. If we assume each bottle contains 500 ml of water (a common size for water bottles), then she consumed a total of 6 x 500 = 3000 ml of water. Since there are 1000 ml in 1 liter, this means she consumed approximately 3 liters of water.

Now, let's calculate how much it would cost her if each bottle costs R12. We can use the formula: Total Cost = Number of Items x Price per Item. In this case, the number of items is 3 (since she consumed 3 liters of water) and the price per item is R12. So, the total cost would be:
Total Cost = 3 x R12 = R36."
Response:  We know that Debbie has 180 water bottles and she drinks 15 water bottles per day. So, if we divide 180 by 15, we get approximately 12 days. Therefore, Debbie will have enough water bottles for 12 days.
Response:  We know that Debbie has 360 soda bottles and she drinks 9 soda bottles per day. So, if we divide 360 by 9, we get approximately 40 days. Therefore, Debbie can use her soda bottles for about 40 days before running out.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 14 rows and each row contains 11 pots. So, to find out how many pots she has in total, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of pots per row:

14 rows x 11 pots/row = 154 pots

Therefore, Faye has 154 pots in her garden."
"Response:  We know that Faye has 12 potatoes and she placed them in 3 rows. To find out how many potatoes are in each row, we can divide 12 by 3: 
12 / 3 = 4 So, Faye has 4 potatoes in each row."
Response:  We know that Faye had 28 pots and each pot contained 24 potatoes. So, she had a total of 28 x 24 = 672 potatoes. Since she planted 16 potatoes in each row, she could make 672 / 16 = 41 rows of potatoes.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 6 packets of potatoes and each packet contains 14 potatoes. So, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 potatoes. 
Now, we are told that she planted her potatoes in rows with 22 potatoes in each row. Therefore, the number of rows she needs is 84 / 22 = 3.95 (round up to 4).
So, Faye has planted 4 rows of potatoes with 22 potatoes in each row, for a total of 4 x 22 = 88 potatoes."
Response:  If Faye has 35 potatoes and 7 colorful potatoes, she can make 35 x 5 = 175 plain potatoes and 7 x 5 = 35 colorful potatoes in total. So, she can make 175 + 35 = 210 potatoes in all.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 19 rows and each row contains 4 pots and 27 crystals. So, to find out how many pots she has, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of pots per row. That would be:

19 x 4 = 76

So, Faye has 76 pots."
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 rows and each row contains 36 potatoes and 30 crickets. So, to find out how many crickets she has, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of crickets in each row: 7 x 30 = 210. Therefore, Faye has 210 crickets.
Response:  We know that Faye has 11 rows and each row contains 31 pots and 27 crystals. So, if we multiply 11 x 31 = 341, we get the total number of pots. Similarly, if we multiply 11 x 27 = 297, we get the total number of crystals. Therefore, Faye has 341 pots and 297 crystals in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 30 potatoes and she plants 5 potatoes in each row. So, if we divide 30 by 5, we get:

30 / 5 = 6

So, Faye can make 6 rows of potatoes."
Response:  We know that Faye had 6 potatoes and she placed them in two rows. If she placed them equally in each row, then she must have placed 3 potatoes in each row. So, the answer is 3 x 2 = 6.
"Response:  We know that Faye had 35 potatoes and each potato produced 4 tubers. So she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 tubers. Since she planted two tubers in each row, we can calculate how many rows she could make as follows: 

140 / 2 = 70 rows

Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of potatoes."
"Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packets of potatoes and each packet contained 6 potatoes. So, we can start by multiplying 31 by 6 to get the total number of potatoes she had:

31 x 6 =?

Do you want to try solving this problem before looking at the solution?"
"Response:  We know that Faye has 30 rows and each row contains either 71 or 24 pots. So we can start by adding up all the pots in each row:

71 + 71 +... + 71 = 3 x 71 = 213
24 + 24 +... + 24 = 3 x 24 = 72

Now we add up all the pots in all the rows:

213 + 72 = 285

So Faye has 285 pots in total."
"Response:  We know that Faye has 16 rows and each row contains either 6 or 21 pots. So we can start by counting how many pots she has in total:

6 x 16 = 96 (pots in 6-row sections)
21 x 16 = 336 (pots in 21-row sections)
Total number of pots = 96 + 336 = 432

Now let's count the crystals. Each pot contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 crystals. Since Faye has 432 pots, she must have a total of:

0 x 432 = 0 crystals
1 x 432 = 432 crystals
2 x 432 = 864 crystals
3 x 432 = 1296 crystals
Total number of crystals = 0 + 432 + 864 + 1296 = 2592

Therefore, Faye has 2592 crystals in her garden."
"Response:  We know that there are 98 learners and 7 school buses. If all the buses are full, we need to find out how many seating places there are in each bus. To do this, we can divide the total number of learners by the number of buses. So, we have:

98 learners / 7 buses =?

We can simplify this calculation as follows:

98 / 7 =?

The result is:

98 / 7 = 14

So, if all the buses are full, there will be 14 seats available in each bus."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms and each classroom has 30 students, so we can start by multiplying 84 by 30 to get the total number of students in the school:

84 x 30 = 2520

Now, we know that there are 95 buses and each bus can seat 118 students, so let's multiply 95 by 118 to find out how many students can fit on all the buses:

95 x 118 = 10790

Since there are more buses than classrooms, we need to subtract the number of students who can fit on the buses from the total number of students in the school to find out how many students are left over:

2520 - 10790 = -8270

Therefore, there are 8270 fewer students at the school than there are seats available on the buses. This means that there must be approximately 8270 students at the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms and each classroom has 66 learners, so the total number of learners is 67 x 66 = 4322. Since each school bus can accommodate 6 learners, we need to divide the total number of learners by 6 to determine how many buses are needed. Therefore, we need 4322 / 6 = 720 buses to transport all the learners.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms and each classroom has 58 students, so the total number of students is 87 x 58 = 4962. Since each school bus can accommodate two seats, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to determine how many buses are needed. Therefore, we need 4962 / 2 = 2481 buses to transport all the students.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms and each classroom has the same number of students (120). So, if we divide 120 by 24, we get an average of 5 students per classroom. Now, we need to find out how many seats are available in each school bus. The problem states that there are 84 seats in each school bus. If we divide 84 by 5 (the average number of students per classroom), we get 16. This means that 16 students can fit in each school bus. Therefore, there are 16 students in each classroom.
"Response:  We know that there are 102 learners and 8 seats per bus. To determine how many buses we need, we can divide the number of learners by the number of seats per bus. In this case, we would divide 102 by 8 to get:

102 ÷ 8 = 13

So, we need 13 buses to transport all 102 learners."
Response:  We know that there are 11 students in total and we need to find out how many will go on the trip. We also know that there are 99 seats available per bus. So if we divide 11 (students) by 99 (seats), we get approximately 0.11 (or 11%). This means that about 11% of the total number of students (11/110 or 11/100) will go on the trip. In other words, approximately 11 students will go on the trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms and each classroom has 3 seats. So, if we multiply 72 by 3, we get 216 seats in total. Since there are 111 students in the school, we need to find out how many buses are needed to transport all of them. To do this, we can divide the total number of seats (216) by the number of seats per bus (3). This gives us:

216 / 3 = 72

So, we need 72 buses to transport all 111 students."
Response:  We know that there are 46 students and 17 classrooms. That means each classroom has approximately 2.65 students (46/17). Now we need to find out how many seats are available in each bus if all the buses are full. Since there are 92 students and 46 buses, we can assume that each bus carries approximately 2 students (92/46). So, if all the buses are full, there would be 2 seats available per bus.
Response:  If Haley has 9 knick-knacks and gives one to each of the 11 boys in her class, then she will have given out 11 x 1 = 11 knick-knacks in total. So, Haley had 9 - 11 = -2 knick-knacks before giving any away.
"Response:  We know that Haley has 10 marbles and she gives 5 marbles to each of some sons. So, if we let x be the number of sons, then Haley will give 5x marbles in total. Since there are only 10 marbles in total, we can set up the equation:

5x = 10

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2

So, Haley gave 5 marbles to 2 sons."
Response:  If there are 23 marbles in total and Haley wants to keep 15 for herself, then she has 23 - 15 = 8 marbles left to distribute among the four boys. Since each boy will receive an equal number of marbles, they will each get 8/4 = 2 marbles.
Response:  We know that there are 13 children in total who want to play with knick-knacks and 50 children who want to play cards. If we divide the number of children into two groups, one group will have 13 children (those who want to play with knick-knacks) and the other group will have 50 - 13 = 37 children (those who want to play cards). Now let's calculate how many knick-knacks each child in the first group will receive. There are 26 knick-knacks in total, so if we divide them equally among the 13 children in this group, each child will receive: 26 / 13 = 2 knick-knacks per child.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and she wants to divide them equally among the second-grade boys in her class, then each boy will receive an equal number of marbles. Since there are 5 boys in the class, we can divide 20 by 5 to find out how many marbles each boy will get.

20 ÷ 5 =?

The result is:

20 ÷ 5 = 4

So each boy in Haley's class will receive 4 marbles."
"Response:  If Haley has 28 marbles and gives 2 to each of some sons, then she must have given marbles to at least two sons. So, let x be the number of sons Haley gave marbles to. Since each son received 2 marbles, Haley gave a total of 2x marbles. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

28 = 2x (1)

Now we need to solve for x. To do so, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 / 2 (2)

x = 14

So there were 14 sons who received marbles from Haley."
"Response:  We know that Frank reads 14 pages per day and there are 392 pages in total. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days

Therefore, it will take Frank 28 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. To find out how many pages are in the book, we can use division. So, we divide 569 (days) by 22 (pages/day): 569 ÷ 22 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 x 22 = 550 pages in the book.
"Response:  We know that the book has 612 pages and is divided into 24 chapters. We also know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading the book. So we can start by calculating how many pages Frank read each day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of pages (612) by the number of days he spent reading (6):

612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day."
Response:  We know that there are 555 pages in total and the book has been divided into 5 main sections or chapters. Therefore, each chapter must have approximately 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111).
"Response:  We know that there are 193 pages in the book and it took Frank 660 days to read it. So we can start by dividing the number of pages by the number of days he spent reading it:

193 pages / 660 days = approximately 0.29 pages per day

Now, we need to convert this fraction to a whole number. To do this, we can round up to the nearest integer. In this case, we will round 0.29 up to 1 page per day.

Therefore, Frank read approximately 1 page per day."
"Response:  We know that each book has 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each book. So we can start by calculating how many pages he read in one day:

249 pages / 3 days = 83 pages per day

Therefore, Frank reads 83 pages per day."
"Response:  We know that each book has 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to complete one book. So if he spent 492 days reading all the books, how many books did he read? 
We can start by dividing the total number of days (492) by the number of days it takes to complete one book (12):
492 / 12 =?
Do you see what we get? The result is:
492 / 12 = 40
So Frank read 40 books!"
Response:  We know that Frank took 16 days to read his favorite book, and it had 112 pages. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading: 112 pages / 16 days = 7 pages/day.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 pages / 8 pages/day = 72 days. Therefore, it will take Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book with 41 chapters and each chapter has 450 pages. To find out how many pages he read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book. So, we can calculate as follows: Total pages = 41 x 450 = 18,950 pages Frank took 30 days to finish the book, so we can write an equation: 18,950 / 30 =? (pages/day) Solving for the unknown variable, we get:? = 632 pages/day Therefore, Frank read approximately 632 pages per day.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has 594 pages. So, if we divide 594 by 3, we get approximately 198 pages per chapter.
"Response:  We know that the book had two chapters with 405 pages each, so the total number of pages is 405 x 2 = 810 pages. Since Frank read the book in 664 days, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows: 

810 pages / 664 days = approximately 1.23 pages per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 packs of DVDs and each pack costs $120. So we can start by dividing $120 by 6 to find out how much one pack costs:

$120 ÷ 6 = $20 per pack

Now we want to find out how much each individual DVD costs. Since there are 5 DVDs in each pack, we can divide the cost of the pack by 5 to get the cost of one DVD:

$20 ÷ 5 = $4 per DVD

So each DVD costs $4."
Response:  If one package costs $81, then three packages will cost $81 x 3 = $243. Therefore, to buy 33 packages of DVDs would cost $243 x 33 = $7,969.
"Response:  We know that each pack of DVDs costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 per pack. So if we want to buy DVDs with $93, we need to find out how many packs we can buy with that amount.

First, let's calculate the cost of one pack of DVDs:
$107 - $106 = $1

Now, let's divide the total amount we have ($93) by the cost of one pack:
$93 ÷ $1 = 93 packs

So, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs with $93."
"Response:  If there is a discount of $25 per package and each package costs $76, we can calculate the price without the discount first:

$76 = $76 x (1 - 0.25)

Since the discount rate is 25%, we can subtract 25% of the original price from the total cost to find the price without the discount:

$76 = $76 x (1 - 0.25)
= $76 x 0.75
= $57

So, the price without the discount is $57. Now, let's apply the discount:

$57 x 0.25
= $14

The amount you need to pay for each package with a 25% discount is $57 + $14 = $71."
Response:  If each pack of DVDs costs $26, then Jy has $104 to spend on DVDs. To find out how many packs she can buy, we can divide $104 by $26: $104 ÷ $26 = 4. So Jy can buy 4 packs of DVDs.
"Response:  If you can buy 28 dollars worth of DVDs and each pack costs x dollars, then you can buy x/28 packets. So, if we set up an equation, it would look like this:

x/28 = 28

Solving for x, we get:

x = 704

So, each packet of DVDs costs $704."
Response:  If there are 18 pigs in total and they are grouped into groups of size 2, then we can start by finding out how many groups of size 2 we can make with 18 pigs. Can you help me with that?
"Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of size 187 in Philip's pie collection. To find out how many pies he has in total, we need to multiply the number of groups by the size of each group:

140 x 187 = 25,960

So, Philip has 25,960 pies in his pie collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 piesangs and they are divided into 7 groups. So each group has 203/7 = 29 piesangs.
Response:  We know that there are 142 piesangs and 356 lemoene in total. The piesangs are divided into 47 groups, so each group has 142/47 = 3 pounds of piesangs. Now we need to find out how many lemoene are in each group. Since there are 356 lemoene in total and they are divided into 178 groups, each group has 356/178 = 2 pounds of lemoene.
"Response:  We know that there are 392 piesangs in total and they are divided into 196 groups. So we can start by dividing 392 by 196 to find out how many piesangs are in each group.

392 ÷ 196 =?

Can you solve this division problem and tell me the result?"
"Response:  If there are 180 piesangs in total and they are divided into groups of size 18, then we can calculate the number of groups as follows:

180 / 18 = 10 (integer)

So, there are 10 groups of piesangs in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 piesangs and they are divided into two groups. So each group has 145 piesangs (290 / 2 = 145). Now we need to find out how many lemoene are in each group. Since there are 87 lemoene and they are divided into 93 groups, each group has approximately 0.93 x 87 = 81 lemoene. Therefore, each group of piesangs has 145 piesangs and 81 lemoene.
"Response:  We know that there are 384 lemons and 192 piesang in Philip's collection. The piesangs are organized into 345 groups, while the lemons are organized into 16 groups. To find out how many lemons are in each group, we need to divide the total number of lemons (384) by the number of groups (16).

384 ÷ 16 =?

The result is:

384 ÷ 16 = 24

So, each group of lemons has 24 lemons."
"Response:  We know that Brenda made 38 cookies in total and each cookie had 19 pieces. So we can start by finding out how many groups of 19 cookies Brenda made:

38 / 19 =?

Can you solve for x (the number of groups)?"
Response:  If Brenda made 14 cookies in total and each cookie has 30 chocolate chips, then she must have used 14 x 30 = 420 chocolate chips in total.
"Response:  We know that Brenda made 5 batches of cookies and each batch had 22 cookies. However, she threw away 17 cookies from one of the batches. So, if we subtract the number of cookies thrown away (17) from the total number of cookies in each batch (22), we get the number of cookies left for each batch:

22 - 17 = 5

Therefore, Brenda has 5 cookies left from each batch."
Response:  If Brenda made 18 cookies and each guest received the same number of cookies, then we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let x be the number of cookies that each guest received. Since there were 9 guests who attended, we know that 9x = 18 (since Brenda made 18 cookies in total). Now, we need to find out what value of x will make this equation true. To do so, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9: 9x / 9 = 18 / 9 x = 2 So, each guest received 2 cookies from Brenda.
"Response:  We know that each guest received 14 cookies and there were two guests in total. So we can start by dividing 14 into two parts to find out how many cookies each guest received.

14 / 2 = 7

So each guest received 7 cookies!"
Response:  If Brenda has made 2 cookies for each of her guests, and she has 10 guests in total, then she has prepared 2 x 10 = 20 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that Frank had 42 pieces of delicious food and he divided them into two bags. So, if we divide 42 by 2, we get 21 as our answer. Therefore, there are 21 pieces of delicious food in each bag.
"Response:  We know that Frank had 26 bags with 33 pieces of candy in each bag. To find out how many candies he had in total, we need to multiply the number of bags by the number of pieces in each bag. So, if we do this, we get:

26 bags x 33 pieces/bag = 858 pieces of candy (rounded to the nearest whole number)"
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 pieces left. Since each sack contains 9 pieces, we can divide 9 (the number of pieces left) by 9 (the number of pieces in each sack): 9 / 9 = 1. Therefore, Frank would have one sack of candy remaining.
"Response:  We know that Frank had 11 pieces of delicious food in each bag and he had 22 bags in total. So, we can start by multiplying 11 by 22 to get the total number of pieces of delicious food Frank had:

11 x 22 = 242

Therefore, Frank had 242 pieces of delicious food in total."
Response:  We know that Frank had 16 pieces of candy and divided them into two bags. So, each bag contains half of the total number of candies, which is 16/2 = 8 pieces of candy.
"Response:  We know that Shirley has 25 boxes of three-piece sets and each box contains 14 pieces. So, to find out how many blades she needs to deliver for each set, we need to divide the number of pieces in each set (14) by the number of boxes she has (25). This gives us:

14 / 25 = 0.56

So, Shirley needs to deliver 0.56 blades for each set. Since there are three blades in each set, this means she needs to deliver approximately 1.68 blades per set (0.56 x 3 = 1.68)."
Response:  If Shirley has 10 boxes of three-piece sets and she needs to deliver five boxes, then she will have to give away (deliver - take) = 5 - 10 = -5 boxes. Since we cannot have negative numbers of boxes, we can conclude that Shirley does not have enough boxes to fulfill the order.
"Response:  We know that the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 67 and the number of bottles of diet soda is 9. To find out how many more bottles of ordinary soda they had than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of ordinary soda. So, if we subtract 9 from 67, we get:

67 - 9 =?

The result is:

67 - 9 = 58

So, they had 58 more bottles of ordinary soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that the number of bottles of diet soda is 61 and the number of bottles of regular soda is 22. To find out how many more bottles of diet soda they had, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the number of bottles of diet soda. So, if we do this, we get:

61 - 22 =?

Do you want me to calculate it for you?"
Response:  We know that the grocery store had 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda. In total, they had 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of soda. Additionally, they had 41 apples. So, the total number of items the grocery store had was 38 + 41 = 79 items.
"Response:  We know that the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 53 more than the number of bottles of diet soda. So if we let x be the number of bottles of diet soda, then the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 53 + x.
We also know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is 79. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (53 + x) = 79
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 53 = 79
Subtracting 53 from both sides gives us:
2x = 26
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 13
So there were 13 bottles of diet soda. Therefore, there were 53 + 13 = 66 bottles of ordinary soda."
"Response:  We know that the health food store had 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda they had than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of regular soda. So, if we subtract 54 from 83, we get:

83 - 54 = 29

So, the health food store had 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles in total and 9 of them contained ordinary soft drinks. That means we have to find out how many bottles had diet sodas. So, if we subtract the number of ordinary soft drinks from the total number of bottles, we get:

17 - 9 = 8

Therefore, they had 8 bottles of diet soda."
"Response:  We know that the number of light drinks is 19 and the number of regular drinks is 60. To find out how many more regular drinks they had than diet drinks, we need to subtract the number of diet drinks from the number of regular drinks. So, let's do that:

60 - 19 =?

The difference between the two numbers is 41 (60 - 19). Therefore, they had 41 more regular drinks than diet drinks."
Response:  We know that the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 32 + 78 = 110 bottles. The number of apples is 78. So we can find out how many more bottles they had than apples by subtracting 78 from 110: 110 - 78 = 32. Therefore, they had 32 more bottles than apples.
"Response:  We know that the number of bottles is equal to the number of apples plus 80 (for ordinary soda) + 54 (for diet soda). So we can write an equation:

Number of bottles = Number of apples + 80 + 54

We are given that the number of apples is 36. Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

Number of bottles = 36 + 80 + 54
= 170

Therefore, the store had 170 bottles in total."
"Response:  We know that out of 30 bottles, 28 were ordinary soft drinks and the rest (2) were diet sodas. So we can start by finding out how many bottles of diet soda they had:

2/30 = x/10 (where x is the number of bottles of diet soda)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

So the store had 20 bottles of diet soda."
Response:  We know that the health food store had 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda. So we can start by finding out how many bottles of regular soda they had in total. To do this, we need to add the number of bottles of diet soda (4) to the number of bottles of regular soda (79): 4 + 79 = 83. Therefore, the health food store had 83 bottles of regular soda.
"Response:  We know that the grocery store had 57 bottles of regular soda, 26 bottles of diet soda, and 27 bottles of light soda. To find out how many bottles they had in total, we need to add all three numbers together. So, if we add 57 + 26 + 27, we get:

57 + 26 + 27 = 100

So, the grocery store had 100 bottles in total."
"Response:  We know that the number of bottles of ordinary soda is 81 and the number of bottles of diet soda is 60. To find out how many more bottles of ordinary soda they had than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the number of bottles of ordinary soda. So, if we do this, we get:

81 - 60 =?

Do you want me to calculate it for you or would you like to try it yourself first?"
"Response:  We know that together they had 49 bottles of soda and 40 were regular soda and 6 were diet soda. To find out how many bottles of regular soda and diet soda they had separately, we can use subtraction. First, let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of bottles to find out how many regular sodas they had:

49 - 6 = 43

So, they had 43 bottles of regular soda. Now, let's subtract the number of regular sodas from the total number of bottles to find out how many diet sodas they had:

49 - 43 = 6

So, they had 6 bottles of diet soda. Therefore, they had 43 bottles of regular soda and 6 bottles of diet soda."""
"Response:  We know that there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on one day and 295 visitors the previous day. To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the second day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the first day from the number of visitors on the second day. So, if we subtract 295 from 317, we get:

317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day."
"Response:  We know that there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before yesterday and 246 visitors yesterday. To find out how many visitors Buckingham Palace had within 25 days, we need to add up all these numbers. So, let's do it!

703 + 246 = 949 (addition)

Therefore, Buckingham Palace had 949 visitors within 25 days."
"Response:  We know that there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace on one day and 100 more visitors came the previous day. So if we add 100 to 666, we get:

666 + 100 = 766

Therefore, there were 766 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question."
"Response:  We know that there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on one day and 406 people have visited the palace in the last 327 days. To find out how many visitors the previous day, we need to divide 406 by 327.

406 ÷ 327 = 1.24

So, there were approximately 1.24 times more visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day than on the day when Rachel found out (132 visitors). Therefore, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day was:

132 x 1.24 = 161

Therefore, there were approximately 161 visitors to Buckingham Palace the previous day."
Response:  We know that there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and Rachel found out that 829 people have visited the palace in the past 85 days. To find out how many visitors the palace had that day, we need to divide the total number of visitors by the number of days since the last visit: 829 / 85 = 10. So, there were 10 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day.
"Response:  We know that there were 71 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 557 visitors on that day. If 188 visitors came the previous day, we can start by finding out how many days it would take for 557 visitors to come if they visited at the same rate as the previous day. To do this, we need to divide the total number of visitors (557) by the number of visitors per day (188):

557 / 188 = 3

So, it would take 3 days for 557 visitors to come if they visited at the same rate as the previous day. Since we are asked to find out how many visits the palace had received within 57 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of visitors per day:

3 x 57 = 171

Therefore, the Buckingham Palace had received 171 visits within 57 days."
"Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings in Buckingham Palace and 661 visitors that day. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, we can find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that day. To do this, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (600) from the total number of visitors on that day (661):

661 - 600 = 61

So, there were 61 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day than there were the previous day."
"Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel found out about it. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that, we can find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace for that particular day as follows:

Let X be the number of visitors who went to Buckingham Palace for that day (i.e., the day after Rachel found out).
We know that X + 419 = 92 (since 419 visitors came the previous day, and 92 visitors came the next day)
X + 419 - 92 =?
Solving for X, we get:
X = 527
Therefore, there were 527 visitors to Buckingham Palace for the day after Rachel found out about it."
"Response:  We know that there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on one day (the day after 471 visitors and before 808 visitors). To find out how many visitors have been to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days, we need to add up all of these daily visitor counts. So, let's do that:

471 + 512 +... + 808 =?

We can see that each number is only 36 more than the previous number, so we can write an equation based on this pattern:

471 + 36 + 36 +... + 36 =?

There are 89 numbers in total, so we can multiply 36 by 89 to get our final answer:

36 x 89 = 3234

So, there have been 3234 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days."
"Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel found out about it. There were also 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel found out compared to the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors from each of those three days from the total number of visitors over those 245 days.

Let's start with the total number of visitors over the 245 days:

Total = 191 + 457 + 705 = 1353

Now let's subtract the number of visitors from each day:

Subtracting 191 from 1353 gives us:

1353 - 191 = 1162

Subtracting 457 from 1162 gives us:

1162 - 457 = 705

So, there were 705 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel found out about it compared to the previous 245 days."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the ingredients was 628 grams and he needed an additional 159 grams to make the mixture. So we can set up the following equation:

Total weight = Additional weight + Initial weight

In this case, the initial weight is what he already had (which is not specified in the problem), so let's call it x. Then we have:

x + 159 = 628

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 159 from both sides of the equation:

x + 159 - 159 = 628 - 159

This simplifies to:

x = 470

So he already had 470 grams of ingredients before adding the additional 159 grams."
"Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of color to paint the vehicles and he has 260 grams already. So we can subtract the amount he already has from the total amount needed:

49 - 260 =?

Do you want to try solving this subtraction problem yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that he needs 57 grams of paint and has 22 grams left. So we can start with the equation:

57 - 22 = x (where x is the amount of paint he already had)

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:

57 - 22 = x
x = 35 (since 57 - 22 = 35)

So he already had 35 grams of paint before starting to add more. Therefore, his total amount of paint would be:

35 + 57 = 92 grams

Therefore, he needed 92 grams of paint in total."
Response:  If he had 166 grams and needed 20 grams more, then he has 166 - 20 = 146 grams left.
"Response:  If he had 557 grams and needed 17 grams more to reach 574 grams (the desired weight), we can calculate how much more he needs as follows:

557 g + 17 g =?

To find out how much more he needs, we add 17 grams to 557 grams:

557 g + 17 g = 574 g

So, he needs 17 grams more to reach his desired weight of 574 grams."
"Response:  We know that Harry has 11 grams of sugar and needs 492 grams in total. So we can start by subtracting what he already has from what he needs: 
492 - 11 = 481 grams."
Response:  We know that there are 94 pluckers and they need to fill 90 baskets of strawberries in 6 days. So, we can start by calculating how many baskets each plucker needs to fill per day. To do this, we divide the total number of baskets by the number of pluckers: 90 / 94 = 0.957 (approximately). This means that each plucker needs to fill about 1 basket per day. Now, let's calculate how many strawberries each plucker needs to pick per day. Since there are approximately 300 strawberries in one basket, we can multiply the number of baskets by 300 to get the daily amount of strawberries needed: 0.957 x 300 = 286 strawberries per day. Therefore, each plucker needs to pick around 286 strawberries per day.
"Response:  We know that there are 266 pickers and they need to fill 90 water drums in 5 days. So, we can start by calculating how many drums each day.

1 drum = 90/5 = 18 drums per day (rounded)

Now, we need to calculate how many casts (vragskaste) of water each day. Since each drum contains 18 casts, we can multiply the number of drums by 18 to get the total number of casts per day:

18 drums x 18 casts/drum = 324 casts per day

So, each day, 324 casts of water will be filled into 18 drums."
Response:  We know that there are 294 pluckers and they can pick 244 baskets of grapes per day and 47 baskets of frames per day. So, if we multiply 294 by 244, we get 70,832 baskets of grapes per day. If we multiply 294 by 47, we get 13,508 baskets of frames per day. Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to fill 146 wagons. One wagon can hold 47 baskets of grapes and 47 baskets of frames. So, we need to divide 146 by 47 to find out how many days it will take to fill one wagon. There are 3 days in each week, so we can divide 146 by 3 to find out how many weeks it will take to fill one wagon. Therefore, it will take 49 weeks to fill 146 wagons (146 / 3 = 49).
Response:  We know that there are 235 pluckers who will provide 100 baskets of strawberries and 221 baskets of raspberries per day. To calculate how many baskets of raspberries will be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of pluckers by the number of baskets they will provide per day. So, if we multiply 235 by 221, we get 51,655 baskets of raspberries. Therefore, in 77 days, 51,655 baskets of raspberries will be filled.
Response:  We know that there are 57 stopping points and each farmer has to fill 108 water drums per day. So, if we multiply 57 x 108, we get 6,096 water drums that need to be filled every day.

Response:  We know that Tyler had 56 aquariums for freshwater fish and each aquarium had 39 fish in it, so he had a total of 56 x 39 = 2144 freshwater fish. He also had 10 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium had 39 fish in it, so he had a total of 10 x 39 = 390 saltwater fish. In total, Tyler had 2144 + 390 = 2534 fish.
"Response:  We know that Tyler had 22 aquariums for saltwater fish and each aquarium had 46 fish in it. So, if we multiply 22 (number of aquariums) x 46 (number of fish per aquarium), we get:

22 x 46 = 992

Therefore, Tyler had 992 saltwater fish."
"Response:  We know that he had 15 akwariums for freshwater fish and each akwarium had 19 fish, so we can calculate how many fish he had in total as follows:

15 x 19 = 285

So, Mr. Smith had 285 freshwater fish.

Now, let's consider the saltwater aquariums. He had 62 of them, and each one had 19 fish as well. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of saltwater fish as follows:

62 x 19 = 1178

So, Mr. Smith had a total of 1178 saltwater fish. In conclusion, Mr. Smith had a total of 285 + 1178 = 1463 fish in all his aquariums."
"Response:  If you buy 39 white T-shirts and each pack contains 13 T-shirts, then you will have:

"Response:  If Jy had 26 sakkies with the same number of cookies, and she had 15 lekkergoed (which means ""good things"" in Afrikaans), then we can start by adding the number of lekkergoed to the total number of sakkies. So, if Jy had 26 sakkies and 15 lekkergoed, then she would have had a total of 26 + 15 = 41 sakkies. Now, since each sakkie contains 52 cookies, we can multiply the total number of sakkies by the number of cookies per sakkie to find out how many cookies Jy had in total. Therefore, Jy would have had 41 x 52 = 2122 cookies in total."
"Response:  If Jy had 14 sacks with the same number of cookies, and she has 28 cookies now, then we can start by finding out how many sacks of cookies Jy had before. To do this, we need to divide the total number of cookies (28) by the number of cookies per sack (let's assume it's 7). So, we have:

28 / 7 = 4

So, Jy had 4 sacks of cookies before. Now, let's find out how many lekkergoed Jy has in total. We know that she has 86 lekkergoed in total, so if we subtract the number of cookies (28) from the total lekkergoed (86), we get:

86 - 28 = 58

Therefore, Jy has 58 lekkergoed left."
"Response:  If each block has 25 posts and each house needs 5 posts, then we can calculate how many houses are in each block as follows:

25 (posts) x 5 (posts per house) = 125 (total posts needed for all houses in the block)

Since there are 25 blocks, we can multiply the total number of posts needed for all houses in one block by 25 to find out how many houses there are in total:

125 (total posts needed for all houses in one block) x 25 (number of blocks) = 3125 (total number of houses in the entire development)

Therefore, there are 3125 houses in the entire development."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and Posman must give out 9 pieces of junk to each house, then he needs to distribute 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of junk per block. Since there are 5 blocks in total, Posman needs to distribute 180 x 5 = 900 pieces of junk in total.
"Response:  There are six houses on the block and each house needs 24 pieces of rubbish bags. So we need to calculate how many rubbish bags each house should receive. To do this, we can divide the total number of rubbish bags (24) by the number of houses (6): 

24 / 6 = 4

So each house should receive 4 sets of rubbish bags."
"Response:  If there are 14 rommelposse and each block has two pieces of rubbish, then we can start by dividing 14 by 2 to find out how many blocks there are:

14 ÷ 2 = 7

So, there are 7 blocks in total."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and each house needs 32 pieces of rubble to be delivered, then we can calculate as follows:

Total number of pieces of rubble needed for all blocks = Number of houses x Number of pieces per house
= 20 x 32
= 640 pieces of rubble

Therefore, the postman must deliver 640 pieces of rubble to each block."
"Response:  We know that there are 78 blocks in total and each block needs to receive 30 pieces of rubble. Since there are 19 houses per block, we can calculate how many pieces of rubble each house will receive as follows:

Total number of pieces of rubble = 78 x 30 = 2340
Number of houses per block = 19

Therefore, each house will receive:

2340 / 19 = 123 pieces of rubble per house

So, Posman must give 123 pieces of rubble to each of the 19 houses on each block."
"Response:  We know that each block has 55 houses and Posman gives 32 portions to each house. So we can start by calculating how many portions Posman needs to give out in total:

32 x 55 = 1760 portions

Now, let's calculate how many blocks Posman needs to buy:

1760 / 32 = 54 blocks

Therefore, there are 54 blocks of houses in the township."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses. So, we need to find out how many pieces of rubble Posman needs to give to each house in each block. To do this, we can use division.

Let's divide the total number of pieces of rubble (4) by the number of houses in each block (12):

4 ÷ 12 =?

The result is:

4 ÷ 12 = 0.33

So, Posman needs to give 0.33 pieces of rubble to each house in each block. Since there are 81 blocks, he will need to give a total of:

0.33 x 81 = 26.53 pieces of rubble

Therefore, Posman needs to give 26.53 pieces of rubble to each house in all 81 blocks."
Response:  We know that there are 17 houses in each block and Posman must give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house. So, he needs to distribute 4 x 17 = 68 pieces of junk mail in total. Since there are 16 blocks, Posman needs to deliver 68 x 16 = 1088 pieces of junk mail.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 knick-knacks. She wants to divide them into groups of 4 each. So we need to find out how many groups she can make with these items. To do this, we will use division.

Let's start by dividing the number of eggs by 4:

10 / 4 =?

The result is:

10 / 4 = 2

So Rebecca can make 2 groups of eggs. Now let's divide the number of knick-knacks by 4:

20 / 4 =?

The result is:

20 / 4 = 5

So Rebecca can make 5 groups of knick-knacks. In total, she can make 2 + 5 = 7 groups. Therefore, the answer is 7."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into groups of 5 each. So we need to find out how many groups she can make with these numbers. To do this, we will use division.  
First, let's divide the number of marbles (10) by the number of objects per group (5): 10 ÷ 5 =?  
The result is 2, so Rebecca can make 2 groups of 5 marbles each. Now, let's see how many eggs she can distribute among these groups:  
15 eggs / 2 groups =?  
The result is 7.5 eggs per group, but since we cannot have half an egg, we will round up to 8 eggs per group. Therefore, Rebecca can make 2 groups of 5 marbles and 8 eggs each."
"Response:  If Rebecca has 11 eggs and divides them into groups of 2, then she will have:

11 (total eggs) / 2 (per group) = 5 (groups)

So, Rebecca will have 5 groups of 2 eggs each. Therefore, the total number of eggs Rebecca has is:

5 x 2 = 10

Rebecca has 10 eggs."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 chicks. She wants to divide them into 4 groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. To do this, let's divide 8 (the total number of eggs) by 4 (the number of groups). 

8 ÷ 4 =?

The result is... 2! Each group will have 2 eggs. And since there are 6 chicks, each group will also have 6 chicks."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 knick-knacks and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. To do this, we can use division.

Let's say she divides the eggs equally among the three groups. If there are x eggs in each group, then we can write an equation:

x + x + x = 15 (because there are 15 eggs total)

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 15

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 5

So each group will have 5 eggs."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 6 each. So we can start by dividing 18 by 6:

18 ÷ 6 =?

Do you know the answer? It's 3! That means Rebecca will have 3 groups of 6 eggs each.

Now let's talk about the other items. She has 72 pieces of pie and 66 knick-knacks. If we divide 72 by 3 (since she has 3 groups), we get:

72 ÷ 3 =?

Can you guess the answer? It's 24! So Rebecca will have 24 pieces of pie in each group.

Finally, let's see how many knick-knacks she'll have in each group. If we divide 66 by 3, we get:

66 ÷ 3 =?

Do you know the answer? It's 22! So Rebecca will have 22 knick-knacks in each group.

So, to summarize, Rebecca will have 3 groups of 6 eggs each, 24 pieces of pie in each group, and 22 knick-knacks in each group."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 pieces of candy and wants to divide them into groups of three. To do this, we can start by dividing 99 by 3.

99 ÷ 3 =?

The result is:

99 ÷ 3 = 33

So, Rebecca can make 33 groups of three candies each."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 chocolates. To find out how many more eggs she has than chocolates, we need to subtract the number of chocolates from the total number of eggs. So, if we subtract 6 from 20, we get:

20 - 6 = 14

So, Rebecca has 14 more eggs than chocolates!"
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 knick-knacks and 12 eggs. To find out how many more eggs she has than knick-knacks, we need to subtract the number of knick-knacks from the number of eggs. So, if we subtract 5 (the number of knick-knacks) from 12 (the number of eggs), we get:

12 - 5 =?

Do you see the solution?"
"Response:  We know that Luke has scored 154 points and he got 11 points in each round. So we can start by dividing 154 by 11 to find out how many rounds he played:

154 / 11 =?

Do you want to try it?"
"Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds and scored 46 points in each round, we can calculate his total score as follows:

Total score = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 177 x 46
= 8202

So, Luke has achieved 8202 points in the tournament."
"Response:  We know that Luke scored 84 points in total and he got the same number of points each round. So, if we divide 84 by the number of rounds he played, we can find out how many points he scored per round. There are two rounds in the trivia game, so let's do:

84 / 2 =?

Do you want to try solving it yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
"Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of a trivia game and there were 157 rounds in total, then we can calculate his total score as follows:

Total score = (146 x 157) = 23,092 points."
"Response:  We know that Luke has played 78 points in the trivia game and he has won 3 points in each round of the competition. To find out how many rounds he has played, we can divide 78 by 3. So, the calculation is:

The result is:

78 / 3 = 26

Therefore, Luke has played 26 rounds in the trivia game."
Response:  We know that Emily had 2 necklaces and she made 32 clasps for her friends. So we can start with the information that each necklace has 16 clasps (since 32 divided by 2 is 16). Now we need to find out how many clasps were needed for one necklace. Since Emily had two necklaces, she must have used twice as many clasps for both of them. Therefore, the number of clasps required for one necklace is double the number of clasps Emily made for her friends, which is 2 x 32 = 64 clasps per necklace.
Response:  If Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace has 28 beads, then she must have had a total of 11 x 28 = 318 beads.
"Response:  We know that each chain has 8 cracles and Emily has 16 cracles in total. So we can make:

16 / 8 = 2 chains

Therefore, Emily can make 2 chains of beads."
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 necklaces and had 6 charms in total. So, each necklace must have had at least one charm. Since she had 6 charms, she could have used them all for her necklaces. Therefore, each necklace needed one charm.
Response:  If Emily made 4 necklaces and each necklace has 5 charms, then she must have had 4 x 5 = 20 charms in total.
"Response:  We know that Emily has 72 friends and she wants to make 6 necklaces for them. Each necklace requires 3 charms, so we can start by finding out how many charms Emily needs in total.  
To find out how many charms Emily needs, we multiply the number of necklaces (6) by the number of charms per necklace (3):  
6 x 3 = 18 charms  
Now we know that Emily needs 18 charms in total. Since each charm bag contains 3 charms, we can divide the total number of charms by the number of charms per bag to find out how many bags Emily will need:  
18 / 3 = 6 bags  
Therefore, Emily can make 6 necklaces with 3 charms each using 6 bags of charms."
"Response:  We know that Emily has 43 friends and she can make 20 chains at most. So we need to find out how many chains of 5 links each she needs to make in total. To do this, we divide the number of friends by the number of links per chain: 

43 friends / 5 links per chain = 8 chains (approximately)
So Emily needs approximately 8 chains of 5 links each to give to her 43 friends."
Response:  We know that Emily made 26 necklaces and each necklace has two charms. So, in total, she had 26 x 2 = 52 charms.
"Response:  We know that there were 819058 children who went to summer camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. To find out how many more children went to summer camp than stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children who went to summer camp. So, we can say:

Total number of children who went to summer camp = 819058
Number of children who stayed at home = 668278

Subtracting the two numbers gives us:

819058 - 668278 =?

To solve for the difference, we can add 668278 to both sides of the equation:

819058 + 668278 =?

Adding the two numbers gives us:

819058 + 668278 = 885836

So, there were 885836 children who went to summer camp, which is 885836 - 668278 = 217558 more children who went to summer camp than stayed at home."
"Response:  We know that 202958 children went to summer camp and 777622 remained at home. To find out how many more children were at home compared to those who went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children who remained at home.

So, the difference between the two numbers is:

202958 - 777622 = 125236

Therefore, there are 125236 more children at home compared to those who went to summer camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and 629424 of them go to camp during summer vacation. That means 268575 (898051 - 629424) children stay at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in Lawrence County and during summer vacation, 274865 of them stay at home while the rest go to camp. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let X be the number of children who go to camp.

We know that X is equal to the difference between the total number of children (313473) and the number of children who stay at home (274865):

X = 313473 - 274865

Simplifying the equation:

X = 390008

Therefore, approximately 390008 children go to camp during the summer vacation in Lawrence County."
"Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County, and 455682 children go to camp. To find out how many children there are in total in Lawrence County, we need to add these two numbers together. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is:

907611 + 455682 = 1363293

Therefore, there are approximately 1,363,293 children in Lawrence County."
Response:  We know that there are 800059 children at the summer camp and the remaining 828521 - 800059 = 28463 children staying at home.
"Response:  We know that there are 91676 children in Lawrence County and 61619 of them went to camp. To find out how many children did not go to camp, we can subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County. So, the answer would be:

91676 - 61619 = 30057

Therefore, approximately 30057 children in Lawrence County did not go to camp."
"Response:  We know that there are 34044 children who went to summer camp in Lawrence County, and 134867 children who stayed at home. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

34044 + 134867 =?

Now, we also know that 424944 children from outside the country visited the camp. If we add this number to the previous total, we get:

34044 + 134867 + 424944 =?

So, the total number of children who visited the camp is:

34044 + 134867 + 424944 = 599855"
Response:  We know that there are 610769 children who went to summer camp and 590796 children who stayed at home. That means there were 610769 - 590796 = 20983 children who went to summer camp. Additionally, 22 children from outside the country attended the camp, so the total number of children in Lawrence County is 20983 + 22 = 21005.
"Response:  We know that there were 644,997 children who stayed at home during the summer vacation in Lawrence County, and 893,835 children attended camp. Additionally, 78 children from outside the country visited the camp. To find out how many children are in Lawrence County, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children who stayed at home. So, the calculation would be:

644,997 - 893,835 =?

Subtracting 893,835 from 644,997 gives us:

644,997 - 893,835 = 201,062

Therefore, there are approximately 201,062 children in Lawrence County."
Response:  We know that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. So if Adam has 9 apples, then Jackie must have 9 - 3 = 6 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So...

10 - 2 =?

Do you see the pattern here? Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So...

Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam."
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So...

10 - 8 =?

Do you see the pattern here? The difference between 10 and 8 is 2! Therefore, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam."
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If they have 4 more than what they have, then we can find out how many apples they have by subtracting 4 from 6. So, if Adam and Jackie have 6 apples, then they have:

6 - 4 = 2 apples each."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples together. If Hetty has more than them, then she must have at least 7 + 1 = 8 apples. So, Hetty has 8 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If they have 9 more than what they have together, then we can find out how many apples each of them has by subtracting 9 from 12.

12 - 9 =?

That gives us:

12 - 9 = 3

So, Adam and Jackie together have 3 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples Adam has. We know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, Adam has x + 8 apples.

x + (x + 8) = 3

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 3

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2

So, Jackie has 2 apples, and Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples."
Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 4 more than Jackie. So, if we add 4 to 10, we get 14. Therefore, Adam has 14 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has 89 lemons and 11 apples, then Adam must have 89 + 5 = 94 apples.
"Response:  We know that Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday, and she has 270 cookies today. So, if we subtract the number of cookies she baked yesterday from the total number of cookies she has today, we can find out how many cookies she baked earlier.

397 - 85 = 312  
Therefore, Helen baked 312 rosyntjie koekies today."
"Response:  We know that Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies yesterday and 231 rocky road cookies today. To find out how many more chocolate cookies than rocky road cookies Helen baked, we need to subtract the number of rocky road cookies from the total number of cookies she baked. So, if we subtract 231 from 260 (the total number of cookies), we get:

260 - 231 = 29

Therefore, Helen baked 29 more chocolate cookies than rocky road cookies."
Response:  We know that yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and 46 rose-finger cookies for a total of 243 cookies. Today, she baked 75 rose-finger cookies and 66 chocolate cookies for a total of 141 cookies. To find out how many more chocolate cookies Helen baked yesterday compared to today, we need to subtract the number of chocolate cookies she baked today from the number she baked yesterday. So, if we subtract 66 (today) from 197 (yesterday), we get: 197 - 66 = 131. Therefore, Helen baked 131 more chocolate cookies yesterday than she did today.
"Response:  We know that yesterday, Helen baked 300 chocolate cookies and 280 raspberry cookies. Today, she baked 280 raspberry cookies and 359 chocolate cookies. To find out how many more raspberry cookies she baked today compared to yesterday, we need to subtract the number of raspberry cookies she baked yesterday from the number of raspberry cookies she baked today. So, if we subtract 280 from 359, we get:

359 - 280 = 79

So, Helen baked 79 more raspberry cookies today than she did yesterday."
"Response:  If Katie has 81 toys and her friends have 59 toys, we can find out how many more toys Katie has by subtracting 59 from 81.

81 - 59 =?

The difference is 22. So Katie has 22 more toys than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has had 91 games and her new friends have had 88 games, so together they have had 91 + 88 = 179 games. And we also know that her old friends have had 53 games, so altogether her friends have had 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new toys and her friend has 48 new toys. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new toys.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 84 new toys and 19 old toys, so we can start by adding these two numbers together to get the total number of toys she has:

84 + 19 = 103

Now, let's look at what her friends have. They have 8 new toys and 69 old toys, so we can add those numbers together as well:

8 + 69 = 77

Finally, we need to find out how many new toys Katie and her friends have altogether. To do this, we can simply add the total number of new toys they both have:

103 + 77 = 180

So, Katie and her friends have 180 new toys in total."
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new toys and 80 old toys, so she has a total of 62 + 80 = 142 toys. Her friends have 73 new toys and 41 old toys, so they have a total of 73 + 41 = 114 toys. To find out how many old toys they have in common, we need to subtract the number of new toys they have from their total number of toys. For Katie, this would be 142 - 62 = 80 old toys. For her friends, this would be 114 - 73 = 41 old toys. So they have 80 old toys in common.
"Response:  We know that Katie has had 57 main games and her friends have had 63 DS games. To find out how many more games Katie's friends have had, we need to subtract the number of main games from the number of DS games. So, we can say that:

63 (DS games) - 57 (main games) =?

Do you want me to calculate this for you?"
"Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new toys and 39 old toys for a total of 57 + 39 = 96 toys. Her friend has 34 new toys. So we can compare the number of new toys they have: 
Katie has 34 more new toys than her friend (57 - 34 = 23)."
"Response:  We know that last week, Fred had $60 and Jason had $19. This week, Jason spent $33 on motor oil. So, we can start by subtracting what Jason spent from his previous amount of money:

$19 - $33 =?

Do you want to try solving this subtraction problem yourself before I give you the answer?"
Response:  We know that Fred had $86 last week and spent some amount of money on motors, so now he has $86 - x dollars, where x is the amount he spent on motors. And we also know that Jason had $5 last week and did not work this week, so he still has $5. Therefore, together they have $86 - x + $5 =?
"Response:  We know that last week, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. This means they together had $19 + $16 = $35. 
This week, Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So together, they have $40 + $69 = $109. 
Therefore, Fred earned $109 - $35 = $74 over this past week."
"Response:  We know that Fred had $114 last week and this week he has $21 less than before. So, if we subtract $21 from $114, we get:

$114 - $21 =?

That gives us:

$93

Now, let's look at Jason's situation. He had $22 last week and this week he has $78 more than before. So, if we add $78 to $22, we get:

$22 + $78 =?

That gives us:

$90

Therefore, Jason made $90 this week."
"Response:  We know that Fred had $111 last week and spent $115 this week on motors, so he has spent more than what he earned. Therefore, his earnings for this week are negative. 
Jason had $40 last week and earned $44 this week, so his total earnings are $44. 
Therefore, the total amount of money earned through motor sales is $44."
Response:  We know that Fred had $49 last week and spent $112 this week, so he has spent $112 - $49 = $63 more than last week. And we also know that Jason had $3 last week and earned $63 this week, so he has earned $63 - $3 = $60 more than last week. Therefore, together they have spent $63 + $60 = $123 more than last week.
"Response:  We know that Fred had $78 last week and this week he spent $90 on motors. So, he has spent $90 - $78 = $12 more than last week. 
Jason had $31 last week and this week he received $14 as change, so he has earned $31 + $14 = $45 more than last week. 
Therefore, together they have earned $12 + $45 = $57 more than last week."
"Response:  We know that Fred had $33 last week and spent $16 on groceries this week. So, how much did he have left after spending $16?  
$33 - $16 = $17  
Now, we know that Fred spent $74 on motor gas. How much did he have left after spending $74?  
$17 - $74 = -$57  
Fred owes money because he spent more than he had."
"Response:  We know that last week, Fred had $47 and this week he earned $111. So, his total earnings for both weeks are:

$47 + $111 = $158

We also know that he spent $34 on motor gas. So, his final amount of money is:

$158 - $34 = $124

Therefore, Fred has $124 now."
Response:  If Jesse weighed 71 kg and lost 20 kg, then she now weighs 71 - 20 = 51 kg.
Response:  We know that Jesse lost 101 kg and her current weight is 27 kg. To find out how much she weighed before starting to run daily, we can subtract 101 from 27. So, Jesse weighed 128 kg (27 + 101) before beginning to run every day.
"Response:  We know that Jessie lost 126 kg and now she weighs 66 kg. So, to find out how much she weighed before starting her running routine, we can subtract 66 kg from 126 kg.

126 kg - 66 kg =?

The result is:

126 kg - 66 kg = 60 kg

So, Jessie weighed 60 kg before starting her running routine."
"Response:  If Jesse lost 35 kg and her initial weight was 69 kg, then she currently weighs:

69 kg - 35 kg =?"
Response:  If Jesse lost 50 kg in the first week and then another 60 kg in the second week, that means she has lost a total of 50 + 60 = 110 kg. So, her current weight is 114 - 110 = 4 kg. Therefore, Jessie now weighs 4 kg less than before, which is 110 kg.
"Response:  We know that Jesse started running after losing weight and before that she weighed x kilograms. In the first week, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is x - 62 kg. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, so her final weight is (x - 62) - 140 kg. To find out what x was before she began running, we can set up an equation using these two expressions for her weight:

x - 62 + 140 =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 182 kg

So, Jesse weighed 182 kg before she started running."
Response:  If Jesse weighed 92 kg and lost 56 kg in the first week, then she would have weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kg after the first week. In the second week, she lost an additional 99 kg, so her weight after the second week would be 36 - 99 = -63 kg. However, this is not possible since her weight cannot be negative. Therefore, the correct answer is 36 kg.
"Response:  If there were initially 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the pen, and 64 snakes escaped, then we need to find out how many snakes remained inside the pen. To do this, we can subtract the number of snakes that escaped from the total number of snakes at first: 95 - 64 =?

So, 31 snakes remained inside the pen."
"Response:  If there were initially 97 alligators and 40 of them escaped, then the number of alligators left in the enclosure would be:

97 - 40 = 57

So, 57 alligators did not escape."
Response:  If there were initially 3 snakes and 75 alligators in the enclosure, then after 82 snakes left, there would be 3 + 82 = 85 animals remaining in the enclosure. Since 19 alligators left, there would be 85 - 19 = 66 alligators remaining in the enclosure. So, 19 alligators did not escape.
Response:  We know that there were 24 snakes and 51 alligators in total in the enclosure. If 24 snakes and 51 alligators escaped, then we need to find out how many animals are left in the enclosure. To do this, we can subtract the number of escapees from the total number of animals. So, if we subtract 24 + 51 = 75 animals from the total number of animals, we get: Total number of animals - 75 =? The answer is 79 - 75 = 4 animals. Therefore, 4 animals remained in the enclosure after 24 snakes and 51 alligators escaped.
"Response:  We know that yesterday he had 134 chickens and today he has 30. So, if we subtract 134 from 171 (the total number of chickens), we get:

171 - 134 =?

That gives us:

171 - 134 = 37

So, after today, he will have 37 chickens left."
"Response:  We know that Mr. Boer had 160 tamarillos in his garden and he picked 56 of them yesterday and 41 today. So, we can start by subtracting the number of tamarillos he picked yesterday from the total number of tamarillos he had:

160 - 56 =?

That gives us:

160 - 56 = 104

So, Mr. Boer had 104 tamarillos left after picking 56 yesterday. Now, let's find out how many tamarillos he has left after picking 41 today:

104 - 41 =?

That gives us:

104 - 41 = 63

Therefore, Mr. Boer has 63 tamarillos left after picking both days."
"Response:  We know that yesterday he had 154 chickens and today he has 50 less than that. So, if we subtract 50 from 154, we get:

154 - 50 =?

That gives us:

154 - 50 = 104

So, he has 104 chickens in total."
"Response:  We know that Andries had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. He picked 172 apples from his trees. To find out how many tomatoes and potatoes he has left, we need to subtract the number of apples he picked from the total number of each fruit he had. For tomatoes, we can do this: 
175 - 172 = 3 So, Andries has 3 tomatoes left. 
For potatoes, we can do this: 
77 - 172 = -95 Andries does not have any potatoes left! He gave all his potatoes away or used them up before picking the apples."
"Response:  We know that 53 tamaties were picked and there are 177 tamaties total. So we can subtract 53 from 177 to find out how many tamaties are left.  
177 - 53 =?  
The result is 124. Therefore, there are 124 tamaties left after picking 53 of them.  
Now let's look at the aartappels. There are 12 aartappels in total, and 53 tamaties were picked. So if we divide 12 by 53, we can find out how many aartappels are left for every tamatie that was picked.  
12 / 53 =?  
The result is approximately 0.23. This means that for every tamatie that was picked, there is approximately 0.23 an aartapple left."
Response:  We know that Andries had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picked 137 tomatoes altogether, we can calculate how many of each color he picked. First, let's find out how many green tomatoes he picked: 105 x 137 = 14295 (since there are 105 green tomatoes) Now, let's find out how many red tomatoes he picked: 71 x 137 = 967 (since there are 71 red tomatoes) So, Andries picked 14295 green tomatoes and 967 red tomatoes.
Response:  We know that each plank needs two nails to secure it in place. So if we want to build a wall with 4 spikes, we need to divide the total number of planks by 2. There are 8 planks in total (4 x 2 = 8). Therefore, John will need 8/2 = 4 planks for the house wall.
"Response:  We know that John needs 13 wooden boards for the house walls and each board requires 17 nails to secure it in place. Additionally, some of the smaller boards require 8 nails. So we can start by calculating how many nails are needed for all the boards:  
13 x 17 = 221 nails (for large boards) + 8 x? (for small boards)  
We don't know yet how many small boards there are, so let's leave the 8x? part blank for now. Now, we need to find out how many small boards there are. The problem states that ""some"" of the smaller boards require 8 nails, which means not all of them do. Let's assume that x small boards have 8 nails each. Then we can calculate the total number of nails needed for all the small boards:  
x x 8 = 8x nails (for small boards)  
Now we can substitute the values we have found into our original equation:  
221 + 8x = Total number of nails needed  
So the total number of nails needed is 221 + 8x."
"Response:  We know that each plank needs three nails to secure it and there will be eight nails left over after all the planks are attached. So we need to find out how many planks can be made with 11 nails. We can do this by dividing 11 by 3.  
11 / 3 =?  
The result is 3 remainder 4. This means we can make 3 full planks and have 4 nails leftover. Therefore, John will need 3 planks for the house wall."
"Response:  We know that John needs 12 large planks and 10 small planks to build the house wall. To calculate how many nails he will need for each type of plank, we can use the following information:

* Large planks: Each large plank requires 3 nails (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, 12 large planks x 3 nails/plank = 36 nails needed for large planks.
* Small planks: Each small plank requires 2 nails (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, 10 small planks x 2 nails/plank = 20 nails needed for small planks.

In total, John will need 36 + 20 = 56 nails to build the house wall."
"Response:  We know that each plank needs two screws to attach it to the wall, so we need to calculate how many screws are needed for all 16 planks. Since there are 2 screws per plank, we can multiply the number of planks by 2 to get the total number of screws needed: 
16 x 2 = 32 screws. Therefore, John will need 32 screws to build his house wall using wooden planks."
Response:  We know that each plank needs 74 nails to secure it in place. If there are 8 planks in total, then we need 8 x 74 = 592 nails for all of them. So John will need 592 nails for the house wall.
Response:  We know that there are 12 large boards and each requires 14 nails to attach them securely. So, we need 12 x 14 = 168 nails for all the large boards. Similarly, there are 17 small boards and each needs 25 nails, so we require 17 x 25 = 425 nails in total for all the small boards. Therefore, John will need a total of 168 + 425 = 693 nails for building his house wall.
"Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of gum in each pack and altogether there are 42 pieces of gum. So we can start by dividing 42 by 3 to find out how many packs there are:

42 / 3 =?

Can you solve this division problem and tell me how many packs Robin has?"
"Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packs of gum and each pack contains 23 pieces of gum. So, if we multiply 43 by 23, we get:

43 x 23 =?

Do you want to try solving this multiplication problem before looking at the answer?"
Response:  We know that there are 7 pieces of gum in each pack and Robin has 6 extra pieces. So if we multiply 7 by 6, we get 42. But we also know that Robin has 41 pieces of gum altogether. Therefore, to find out how many packs Robin has, we can subtract 41 from 42, which gives us... (drumroll please)... 1! Yes, Robin has one pack of gum.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packs of cookies and each pack contains 4 pieces of cookie. So we can start by multiplying the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many total pieces of cookie Robin has:

28 x 4 = 112

So Robin has 112 pieces of cookie!"
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packs of cookies and 45 packs of snacks. Since each pack contains 9 items, we can calculate how many items Robin has in total as follows:

Cookies: 21 x 9 = 189 cookies
Snacks: 45 x 9 = 405 snacks
Total items: 189 + 405 = 694 items
Therefore, Robin has 694 items in total (cookies and snacks combined)."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packs of cookies and 14 packs of snacks. Since each pack contains 6 items, we can calculate how many items Robin has altogether.

For the cookies:
28 packs x 6 items per pack = 168 items (cookies)

For the snacks:
14 packs x 6 items per pack = 84 items (snacks)

In total, Robin has:
168 + 84 = 252 items"
Response:  We know that the industrial machine can make 3 hems per minute. So if it works for 6 minutes, it will make a total of 6 x 3 = 18 hems.
"Response:  We know that the industrial machine can produce 4 hammers per minute and we want to find out how many hammers it has produced in total if it works for 5 minutes.

1 minute = 60 seconds (there are 60 seconds in 1 minute)
4 hammers/minute x 60 minutes =? hammers

So, the total number of hammers produced by the machine is:

4 hammers/minute x 60 minutes = 240 hammers

Therefore, the machine will produce 240 hammers in total if it works for 5 minutes."
"Response:  We know that the machine made 90 items yesterday and 44 items today, so together it made 134 items (90 + 44). And we are told that the machine can make 3 items per minute, so we need to divide the total number of items by the number of items per minute to find out how many minutes the machine worked:

134 items / 3 items/minute = 44.67 minutes (round up to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 45 minutes yesterday."
Response:  We know that the machine can make 8 hems per minute and it worked for 13 hours (13 x 60 = 780 minutes). So, we multiply 780 by 8 to get the total number of hems made by the machine: 780 x 8 = 6240 hems.
"Response:  We know that the machine made 9 hours yesterday and 8 hours today. So, in total, it worked for 17 hours (9 + 8). Now we need to find out how many minutes it worked. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

17 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1020 minutes

Therefore, the machine worked for 1020 minutes today."
"Response:  We know that the industrial machine can make 3 hems per minute and it worked for g hours yesterday (g = 4) and today (d = 8). So we need to calculate how many minutes the machine worked in total.

Total working time = Yesterday + Today
= 4 hours + 8 hours
= 12 hours

Therefore, the machine worked for 12 hours in total."
"Response:  We know that the industrial machine can make 6 hammers per minute and it worked for 12 minutes yesterday and 14 minutes today. So we need to calculate how many hammers were made in total.

Yesterday:
The machine worked for 12 minutes, so it made:

6 hammers/minute x 12 minutes = 72 hammers

Today:
The machine worked for 14 minutes, so it made:

6 hammers/minute x 14 minutes = 84 hammers

Total number of hammers made:
72 + 84 = 156 hammers"
"Response:  We know that the industrial machine can make 6 hammers per minute and it worked for 12 minutes today. So we need to multiply the number of hammers it can make per minute by the number of minutes it worked today.

6 hammers/min x 12 minutes = 72 hammers

Therefore, the industrial machine made 72 hammers today."
"Response:  We know that they have $165 total for 5 days and each day they earn the same amount of money. So we can start by finding out how much they earn per day. To do this, we divide the total amount by the number of days:

$165 / 5 = $33 per day

So, they earn $33 per day."
"Response:  We know that the carnival lasted for 22 days and they made $144 per day. So we can calculate how much money they made in total as follows:

$144 x 22 = $3,068

Therefore, they made a total of $3,068 during the carnival."
"Response:  We know that the carnival makes $420 in total over 30 days and they make an additional $22 from the ring toss game. So, we can start by finding out how much they make per day from the ring toss game.

We know that the daily earnings from the ring toss game is $22, so we can set up the equation:

$22 = (Total Daily Earnings) x (Number of Days Played)

Now, we need to find out what the total daily earnings are for the carnival as a whole. We know that the total amount earned over 30 days is $420, so we can set up another equation:

$420 = Total Daily Earnings x 30

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to solve for the number of days played and the total daily earnings for the ring toss game?"
"Response:  We know that the carnival earned $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the remaining 10 days. To find out how much they earned in total, we need to add these two amounts together. So, the total amount earned by the carnival is:

$382 + $374 = $756"
Response:  We know that the total amount earned during the first 20 days was $120 and the total amount earned during the remaining 16 days was $66. So we can start by finding out how much they earned per day during the first 20 days. To do this, we need to divide the total amount earned during the first 20 days by the number of days: $$ \frac {120} {20} = 6 $$ Therefore, they earned $6 per day during the first 20 days. Now let's find out how much they earned per day during the remaining 16 days. To do this, we need to divide the total amount earned during the remaining 16 days by the number of days: $$ \frac {66} {16} = 4 $$ Therefore, they earned $4 per day during the remaining 16 days.
Response:  We know that the total amount earned during the first 154 days was $325 and the total amount earned during the remaining 57 days was $114. So we can start by finding out how much they earned per day during the first 154 days. To do this, we need to divide the total amount earned during those days by the number of days: $$ \frac{325}{154} = 2.125\text { dollars per day} $$ Now we want to find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days. Again, we can use division: $$ \frac{114}{57} = 2.03\text { dollars per day} $$ Since these are average daily earnings, we can multiply each result by the number of days to get the total amount earned for each period: $$ \begin{aligned} \text {Total earnings during first 154 days} &= 2.125\text { dollars per day} \times 154\text { days} \\ &= 325\text { dollars} \end{aligned}$$ $$ \begin{aligned} \text {Total earnings during last 57 days} &= 2.03\text { dollars per day} \times 57\text { days} \\ &= 114\text { dollars} \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the carnival earned $325 during the first 154 days and $114 during the last 57 days, for a total of $439.
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 10 packets of cookies and 4 packets of cookies. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, Lucy has bought 14 packets of cookies in total."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 4 packets of cookies (22 packets x 4 = 88 packets). She also bought 16 packets of chocolate. In total, she bought 88 + 16 = 104 packets of sweets.
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packets of cookies and some packets of spices. If we call x the number of packets of cookies she bought, then we can write an equation based on the information given:

x + 23 = 27 (since she had 27 packets of goods in total)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4 (Since 23 + 4 = 27)

Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packets of cookies in addition to the ones she already had."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 2 packets of cookies and 12 packets of cookies. If we write this down mathematically, we can say that Lucy bought 2 + 12 = 14 packets of cookies. Now, let's find out how much money Lucy spent in total. We know that she spent R56 on all her purchases. So, if we divide R56 by the number of packets of cookies she bought, we get: R56 ÷ 14 = R4 per packet of cookies. Therefore, Lucy paid R4 for each packet of cookies she bought.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 12 people on the bus and then 4 more got on at the next stop. So, the total number of people on the bus now is:

12 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are 16 people on the bus now."
"Response:  We know that there were 8 people on the bus initially and then 12 more people boarded at the next stop. So, the total number of people on the bus now is:

8 + 12 = 20

Now, we are told that 3 people got off the bus, so the current number of people on the bus is:

20 - 3 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 people on the bus now."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 4 people on the bus (Aanvanklik was daar 4 mense op die bus). Then, 13 more people climbed onto the bus (By die stop het 13 ander mense op die bus geklim). So, if we add 4 + 13, we get:

4 + 13 = 17

Therefore, there are now 17 people on the bus."
Response:  We know that there were originally 11 people on the train and 8 people got off. So, if we subtract 8 from 11, we get... (pause for students to calculate)...7! That means there are now 7 people left on the train.
"Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people in total. This means that if we subtract the number of parents from the total number of people, we will get the number of learners. So, let's do that:

676 - 22 =?

Do you want to try solving this subtraction problem?"
"Response:  We know that there were 73 ouders, 724 leerlings, and 744 onderwyser. To find out how many people were involved in the program, we need to add up all these numbers. So, the total number of people involved in the program is:

73 + 724 + 744 = 1541

Therefore, there were 1541 people involved in the program."
"Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 learners in total. To find out how many more learners were present compared to the number of parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of learners. So, if we subtract 174 (parents) from 521 (learners), we get:

521 - 174 =?

The difference between the two numbers is:

521 - 174 = 347

So, there were 347 more learners present compared to the number of parents in the program."
"Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 learners at the program. If each person took up one seat, then we would have:

61 + 177 = 238 people

So, there were 238 people at the program."
"Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave. So, if we subtract 919 from 1307, we get:

1307 - 919 = 388 feet

Therefore, the distance to the end of the cave is 388 feet."
"Response:  We know that they have already dug 849 feet and need to dig an additional 369 feet (1218 - 849) to reach the end of the cave. Since they are digging at a rate of 17 feet per day, it will take them:

369 ft / 17 ft/day = 21 days

Therefore, they still have 21 days left before reaching the end of the cave."
Response:  We know that they are already at 659 feet and the depth of the cave is 762 feet. To find out how far they still have to go before reaching the end of the cave, we can subtract the current height from the total depth: 762 - 659 = 103 feet. So, they still need to descend 103 feet before reaching the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 goldfish (6 big and 6 small) in the pond. According to the information provided, Paige had 8 large goldfish in the dam. So we can deduce that 4 small goldfish are missing.
"Response:  If Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in her pond, and street cats ate some of them, then she must have had fewer fish after the street cats were done eating. So we need to find out how many fish were left after the street cats finished eating.

Let's assume that the street cats ate x number of fish. Since there were 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in total, and x is the number of fish eaten by the street cats, we can set up the following equation:

7 + 12 = x + (x - 15)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22

So, if Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in her pond, and street cats ate all of them, she would be left with 22 fish."
"Response:  If there were initially 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond, and if 2 hours have passed, then the number of goldfish that have disappeared can be calculated as follows:

16 (initial number of goldfish) - 2 (number of hours that have passed) = 14 (remaining number of goldfish)

So, 16 - 2 = 14 goldfish have disappeared."
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish and 5 were eaten by cats. So, how many goldfish are left? To find out, we can subtract 5 from 15: 15 - 5 =? Can you solve for the missing number? That's right! There are 10 goldfish left.
Response:  If the boss had 43 apples and gave two to each of his employees (you and another person), then he would have given a total of 2 x 2 = 4 apples away. So, the number of apples he has left is 43 - 4 = 40 apples.
"Response:  We know that Harry had 58 apples and he used 35 of them to make pies. So, we can start by subtracting 35 from 58:

58 - 35 =?

That gives us:

23

So, Harry has 23 apples left."
"Response:  We know that after making some pies, Hans had 39 oranges left. So we can start by subtracting the number of oranges he used in the pies from the total number of oranges he had.

Let x be the number of apples Hans used to make the pies. Since each pie requires 2 apples, we have:

x = 2(39) = 78

Now, let's find out how many apples Hans had left after using 78 apples to make the pies. We can do this by subtracting 78 from the total number of apples he had:

40 - 78 =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
Response:  We know that each shelf has 11 action figures and there are four shelves in total. So, if we multiply the number of shelves (4) by the number of action figures per shelf (11), we get a total of 4 x 11 = 44 action figures.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 10 action figures and his room can hold 8 action figures. So we need to find out how many shelves or racks Adam needs to display all of his action figures.

Let X be the number of shelves needed. Since each shelf can hold 8 action figures, we can write an equation based on this information:

X x 8 = 10... (1)

Now solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

X = 10/8... (2)

Simplify the fraction by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4:

X = 5... (3)

Therefore, Adam needs 5 shelves to display all of his action figures."
Response:  We know that each rack has 10 hooks and Adam has 8 action figures. So, if we multiply 10 (number of hooks) x 4 (number of racks), we get 40 hooks in total. Now, since Adam has 8 action figures, he can place them on these 40 hooks. Therefore, the total number of items that Adam can hold in his room is 8 action figures or 40 hooks.
Response:  There are ten gardens with 544 pots each. That means there are 10 x 544 = 5440 pots in total. Each pot has 32 flowers, so the total number of flowers is 5440 x 32 = 176,880 flowers.
"Response:  We know that there are 466 pots and each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks inside it. So we can start by calculating how many flowers and sticks there are in total. 
Flowers: 466 x 53 = 25,798 flowers 
Sticks: 466 x 181 = 84,096 sticks Now we have our final answers! There are 25,798 flowers and 84,096 sticks in total."
"Response:  We know that each pot has 71 flowers and 91 sticks inside it. So if there are 141 pots, we can multiply the number of flowers and sticks for each pot to find out how many flowers and sticks there are in total. 
Flowers: 141 x 71 = 10,011 flowers
Sticks: 141 x 91 = 12,811 sticks
Therefore, there are 10,011 flowers and 12,811 sticks in total."
"Response:  If each pot contains 40 flowers, and there are 400 flowers in total, then we can calculate how many pots there must be:

400 flowers / 40 flowers per pot = 10 pots

So, there are 10 pots in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in total and Steven has 4276 of them. So, we can start by finding out how many Skittles are left for grouping.

4502 - 4276 = 226

Now, we need to divide this remaining number (226) into groups of 154 each. To do so, we can use division.

226 ÷ 154 = 1

So, there will be one group of 226 Skittles.

Therefore, each group will have 154 Skittles."
"Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in total and Steven has 4950 outliers. So we can start by dividing the total number of Skittles by the number of outliers:

3941 / 495 = 8

This means that each group of outliers contains approximately 8 Skittles. Now, we need to find out how many groups of outliers there are in total. To do this, we can divide the number of outliers by the size of each group:

4950 / 8 = 621

So there are approximately 621 groups of outliers in total."
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and they are divided into 8 groups. So each group has 896/8 = 112 Skittles.
"Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each grade has 5 students. So we can start by finding out how many grades there are in total. To do this, we divide 270 by 5 (the number of students in each grade):

270 ÷ 5 =?

Do you see what we get when we divide 270 by 5? That's right! There are 54 grades in total. Now we know that there are 54 grades with 5 students in each grade, for a total of 270 students."
"Response:  We know that there are 304 grades and each grade has 75 students. So we can start by multiplying 304 by 75 to get the total number of students:

304 x 75 =?

Do you want to try it yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
