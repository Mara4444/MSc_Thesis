Response:  On Monday, she played with 18 children and on Tuesday, she played with 10 children, so she played with 8 more children on Monday (18 - 10 = 8).
"Response:  On Monday, 朱莉娅 played hide and seek with 11 children. On Tuesday, she played hide and seek with 12 children. To find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Monday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Let's do that:

12 - 11 =?

Answer: She played with 1 more child on Tuesday than on Monday."
Response:  If 朱莉娅 played with 5 children on Monday and then with some other children on Tuesday, and she played with a total of 15 children altogether, then she must have played with 10 children on Tuesday (since 5 + x = 15, where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday).
Response:  On Monday, 朱莉娅 played hide and seek with 4 children. If she played with 16 children in total, then she played with 4 + 12 = 16 children on Monday.
Response:  If 朱莉娅 played with 12 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday, and she played with 16 children on Tuesday, then she played with 4 more children on Tuesday (16 - 12 = 4).
Response:  On Monday, 朱莉娅 played hide and seek with 8 children. So, on Monday, she played with 8 children.
Response:  In total, 朱莉娅 played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response: 39 (15 + 18 + 4)
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, there were 5 + 9 = 14 children playing hide-and-seek with Zhu Liya.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, there were 2 + 14 = 16 children playing with 朱莉娅 (Zhū Língyà). On Wednesday, there were 16 + 10 = 26 children playing with her. Therefore, Zhū Língyà played with a total of 16 + 26 = 42 children over the three days.
"Response:  On Monday, 朱莉娅 played with 9 children, and on Tuesday, she played with 7 children, so the difference is:  

9 - 7 = 2 

Therefore, 朱莉娅 played with 2 more children on Monday than on Tuesday."
"Response:  On Monday, 朱莉娅 played with 14 children, and on Wednesday, she played with 8 children. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  

14 - 8 =?  Answer:  6"
"Response:  The number of children who played on Tuesday minus the number of children who played on Monday is equal to the number of children who played on Tuesday minus the number of children who played on Sunday. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Tue - Mon = Tue - Sun

We know that there were 8 children playing on Monday and 11 children playing on Tuesday. We also know that there were 9 children playing on Sunday. So we can substitute these values into the equation:

8 + 3 = 11 + 9

Solving for the difference between Tuesday and Monday, we get:

3 = 2

Therefore, there were 2 more children playing on Tuesday than on Monday."
"Response: 8 (starred)
Explanation: In total, there were 15 children playing with 朱莉娅 on Monday and Tuesday, and 7 children playing with her on Wednesday. To find out how many more children played with her on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children playing on Wednesday from the total number of children playing on Monday and Tuesday.

So, the difference is:

15 - 7 = 8

Therefore, 朱莉娅 had 8 more children playing with her on Monday and Tuesday than she did on Wednesday."
Response:  Total number of children played with = 13 + 10 + 15 = 38
Response:  The total number of children that 朱莉娅 played hide and seek with is 7 + 13 + 20 = 40.
Response:  If 朱莉娅 played hide and seek with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday, then she played hide and seek with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 19 children for 18 hours (18 x 2 = 36). On Tuesday, she played with 18 children for 20 hours (18 x 2 = 36 + 4 = 40). In total, she spent 38 hours playing hide and seek with 19 + 18 = 37 children. So, she played with an average of 37/2 = 18.5 children per day.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 6 children, and on Tuesday, she played with 5 children, so she played with 1 fewer child on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 4 children. On Tuesday, she played with x children (where x is a positive integer). In total, she played with 4 + x children.
Response:  The difference between the number of children she played with on Monday (6) and the number of children she played with on Thursday (4) is 2.
"Response:  Bobby initially ate x candy pieces and then ate an additional 25 candies, so in total he ate x + 25 candies. To find out how many candies Bobby ate at first, we can set up the equation:  
x + 25 = 43  Subtracting 25 from both sides gives us:  
x = 18  So Bobby initially ate 18 candy pieces."
Response:  Bobby吃了(28+42+63) = 133块糖果。
Response:  Bobby吃了33+4=37块糖果， plus 14块巧克力， so he ate a total of 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of candy and chocolate.
Response:  Bobby吃了38 + 36 = 74块糖果，而巧克力只有16块，所以Bobby吃了74 - 16 = 58块糖果比巧克力多。
Response:  Bobby一共吃了34+18=52块糖果。
Response:  Bobby has 21 candies and he eats 5 of them, so he has 21 - 5 = 16 candies left. Then he eats another 9 candies, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 candies left.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of candy pieces Bobby had initially as x. Since he ate some and then ate 5 more, we can write the equation to represent the situation as follows:  
x - (some) + 5 = 8 
Since ""some"" is an unknown quantity, we need to find out how many candies Bobby ate at first. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:  
x - (some) = 8 - 5 
x - (some) = 3 
Now, we can solve for ""some"":  
some = x - 3 
So, Bobby ate 3 candies at first."
"Response:  Bobby has 19 candies left after eating 2 candies.  

Question:  If Sally has 36 pencils and she gives 8 pencils to her friend, how many pencils does Sally have left? 
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Sally has 28 pencils left after giving 8 pencils to her friend."
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he is left with 20 pieces after eating some, then he must have eaten 12 pieces (32 - 20 = 12).
Response:  Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy and ate 17 pieces, leaving him with  36 - 17 = 19 pieces of candy. Then he ate another 15 pieces, leaving him with  19 - 15 = 4 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  Bobby still has 7 pieces of candy left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Eileen has 5 balloons and Jack has 3 balloons, so Eileen has 2 more balloons than Jack.
Response:  If 艾伦 has 2 balloons and 杰克 has 3 balloons, then 杰克 has more balloons than 艾伦 by 1 (3 - 2 = 1).
"Response:  If Ailun brought 2 balloons and Jack brought x balloons, then we can set up the equation as follows:  
Ailun brought 2 balloons, so she has 2 balloons.  
Jack brought x balloons, so he has x balloons.  
In total, they have 2 + x balloons.  
Since they are going to the park together, we know that the sum of their balloons is equal to the number of balloons they will take to the park:  
2 + x = 3 (since they are taking 3 balloons to the park)  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 1  
So Jack brought 1 balloon to the park."
Response:  If Jack brought 6 balloons to the park and Allen brought 4 more than Jack, then Allen brought 6 + 4 = 10 balloons to the park.
Response:  If Jack brought 6 more balloons than Ellen, and Ellen brought 5 balloons, then Jack brought 5 + 6 = 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Allan brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park, so together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons. After buying 2 more balloons in the park, Allan now has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons, and Jake still has 5 balloons, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 balloons.
Response:  Eileen has 2 balloons and Jack has 4 balloons. If they both go to the park and Eileen buys 3 more balloons, then Eileen will have 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total, while Jack will still have 4 balloons. So, Eileen has more balloons than Jack by 5 - 4 = 1 balloon.
Response:  If 艾伦 (Alice) brought 2 balloons and 杰克 (Jack) brought 6 balloons to the park, then Alice had 2 balloons and Jack had 6 balloons. If Alice bought 3 more balloons in the park, then she had a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Therefore, Jack had more balloons than Alice by 6 - 5 = 1 balloon.
Response: 8 (5 + 3)
"Response:  If 艾伦 (Alice) has 6 balloons and 杰克 (Jack) has 2 balloons, then Alice has 6 - 2 = 4 more balloons than Jack.  
If Jack buys 3 more balloons in the park, then he will have 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. Therefore, Alice will still have 4 more balloons than Jack after he buys the additional balloons."
Response:  Jack has more balloons than Allen by 6 - 3 = 3 balloons.
Response:  Jack took 6 balloons from home and bought 3 more in the park, so he took a total of 6 + 3 = 9 balloons to the park.
Response:  There will be a total of 3 + 5 = 8 gas balls in the park.
Response:  There will be a total of 7 + 6 = 13 balls in the park if Allen and Jack go there together.
Response:  Jack brought 1 more balloon than Allen, so Jack brought 6 - 5 = 1 balloons to the park.
Response:  If 艾伦 (Alice) brought 2 balloons to the park and bought 3 more there, then she has a total of 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park.  If 杰克 (Jack) brought 6 balloons to the park, then he has 6 balloons at the park. So, Jack has more balloons than Alice by 6 - 5 = 1 balloon.
Response:  He spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese, so he spends 6 - 2 = 4 more hours studying English than Chinese.
Response:  He spent more time studying Chinese (7 hours) than English (6 hours). The difference is 1 hour.
Response:  If he spends 4 hours studying English and Chinese every day, then he spends 2 hours (4 hours - 2 hours) studying Chinese.
Response:  If he spends 7 hours studying English and 2 more hours studying Chinese, then he spends a total of 9 hours studying languages (7 + 2 = 9).
Response:  If he spends 5 hours studying Chinese and 2 more hours studying English, then he spends a total of 7 hours studying English (2 hours more than Chinese).
Response:  If he studied for 5 days, he spent a total of 30 hours studying English (6 hours/day x 5 days) and 35 hours studying Chinese (7 hours/day x 5 days).  Therefore, his total study time was 30 + 35 = 65 hours.
Response:  If he studied for 2 days, he spent 6 hours studying English each day, so he spent a total of 12 hours studying English (6 hours/day x 2 days).
Response:  If he studied for 6 days and spent 4 hours each day studying Chinese, then he spent a total of 4 x 6 = 24 hours studying Chinese.
"Response:  If he studies for 86 days, and each day he spends 4 hours studying English and 6 hours studying Chinese, then he will have studied:  
English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 344 hours  
Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 510 hours"
Response:  The person spent 6 hours studying English + 7 hours studying Chinese = 13 hours studying two languages (English and Chinese). Additionally, they spent 3 hours studying Spanish, so in total, they spent 13 + 3 = 16 hours studying three languages (English, Chinese, and Spanish).
Response:  The student spends more time studying English (6 hours) than Chinese (3 hours). Therefore, the difference in study time for English and Chinese is 6 - 3 = 3 hours per day.
Response:  He spent more time studying English (7 hours) than Spanish (4 hours). The difference is 3 hours (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  He spends more time studying Chinese (5 hours) than Spanish (4 hours). The difference is 1 hour, or 60 minutes.
Response:  If Rao spends 2 hours studying English every day, he spends 1 hour (2 - 2 = 1) studying Chinese.
"Response:  Ryan spent 28 hours learning English and 30 hours learning Chinese, for a total of 58 hours.  
Explanation: To calculate the number of hours Ryan spent learning each language, we need to multiply the number of days he studied by the number of hours per day. For English, he studied for 7 days x 4 hours/day = 28 hours. For Chinese, he studied for 7 days x 5 hours/day = 35 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours Ryan spent learning both languages is 28 + 35 = 63 hours."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 8 bags of recyclables. On Tuesday, she found 7 more bags. So, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of recyclables on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 7 bags of recyclables. On Tuesday, she found 12 more bags, so she collected 12 - 7 = 5 more bags than on Monday.
"Response: 2 bags. 
Explanation: If Tiffany has 4 bags on Monday and finds twice as many bags on Tuesday, then she will have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 bags. Therefore, she found 2 more bags on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 5 bags of cans.
Response:  Total number of bags = 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bags.
Response:  Total number of plastic bags collected by Tiffany = 8 + 10 + 4 = 22.
Response:  Total number of bottles = 3 + 7 + 44 = 54 bottles.
Response:  There are 17 red cherries and 16 green cherries in the basket, so there are 17 - 16 = 1 more red cherry than green cherry.
Response:  There are 11 - 5 = 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
"Response:  There are 3 green peaches in the basket. 
Explanation: Since there are 10 red peaches and 15 peaches in total, there must be 3 green peaches (15 - 10 = 3)."
Response:  There are 10 more green apples than red apples in the basket. Therefore, there are 3 + (10 - 3) = 3 + 7 = 10 green apples in the basket.
Response:  There are 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 桃子 in total.
"Response:  There are 8 green apples in the basket, and there are 7 red apples and 71 yellow apples, so the number of green apples is:  

8 = (7 + 71) / 2 

Therefore, there are 7 + 71 = 85 yellow apples, and the ratio of yellow apples to red apples is 85/7 = 12. So, there are 12 more yellow apples than red apples."
Response:  There are 14 green walnuts and 6 yellow walnuts in the basket, so there are 8 more green walnuts than yellow walnuts (14 - 6 = 8).
Response:  There are 19 red cherries - 11 yellow cherries = 8 more red cherries than yellow cherries.
Response:  There are 6 red cherries and 16 green cherries in the basket.
Response:  There are 18 red cherries and 14 yellow cherries in total.
Response:  There are 6 green walnuts and 14 yellow walnuts in the basket.
Response:  There are 65 baskets with 7 red cherries and 3 green cherries each, so there are 65 x 7 = 455 red cherries and 65 x 3 = 195 green cherries in total.
"Response:  There are 11 baskets with 10 red cherries and 18 green cherries in each basket, for a total of:

11 x 10 = 110 red cherries
11 x 18 = 198 green cherries
Total number of cherries: 110 + 198 = 308."
Response:  There are 6 baskets with a total of 16 red cherries and 18 green cherries in each basket, so there are 6 x 16 = 96 red cherries in all the baskets.
Response:  There are 7 baskets with a total of 10 red cherries and 2 green cherries in each basket, so there are 7 x 2 = 14 green cherries in all the baskets.
Response:  There are 2 baskets that contain peaches. Each basket contains 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, for a total of 7 peaches per basket. Therefore, there are 2 baskets in total that contain peaches.
Response:  There are 12 red cherries and some green cherries in each basket, so there must be at least 12 + x = 16 green cherries in total. Since each basket has 4 red cherries, we can set up the equation: 4x = 16 - 12 = 4. Solving for x gives us x = 4, so each basket has 4 green cherries.
Response:  There are 16 - 13 = 3 green cherries in the basket.
Response:  There are 19 red cherries and 4 green cherries in each basket, so there are 19 x 15 = 285 red cherries and 4 x 15 = 60 green cherries in total.
"Response:  There are 10 red cherries and 10 green cherries in total, so we can let X be the number of baskets. Since each basket contains 4 red cherries and 6 green cherries, we have:

X = 10/4 + 10/6

Simplifying, we get:

X = 2 + 10/6

X = 2 + 10/6 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 baskets."
Response:  There are 6 green apples in total, and 2 red apples. The ratio of green to red is 6/8 = 3/4. Therefore, there are 3/4 x 6 = 9 green apples that are more than the number of red apples.
Response:  Jerry added 4 action figures to his shelf, bringing the total number of action figures on the shelf to 8.
Response: 3.
Response:  There are 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on Jeremy's bookshelf.
Response:  There are 12 action figures (7 + 5) on the bookshelf, and there are 9 books. So, there are 12 - 9 = 3 more action figures than books on the bookshelf.
Response:  There are 10 books on the bookshelf before Jeremy added more people, so there are 10 - 4 = 6 books on the bookshelf after he added more people.
Response:  There are 9 + 10 = 19 books on Jerry's bookshelf after he added 10 more books to the existing 9 books.
Response:  There are 7 action figures in Jerry's room and 6 books on the bookshelf before he added more books. After adding 4 more books, there would be a total of 10 books on the bookshelf. Therefore, there are 7 action figures for every 10 books on the bookshelf. So, the number of action figures that are more than the number of books is 7 - 10 = -3.
"Response:  There are 11 books on the bookshelf for every 5 action figures. 
Explanation:  To find out how many books there are compared to the number of action figures, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of action figures. In this case, there are 11 books (5 + 9 = 11) and 5 action figures, so the ratio is 11:5 or 2:1. This means that for every one action figure, there are two books on the bookshelf."
Response:  There are 13 action figure models on Jerry's shelf, including 8 old ones and 5 new ones.
Response:  Jerry has 6 action figures on his shelf, and he took away 3 of them. So, there are 6 - 3 = 3 action figures left on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry added 3 action figures to his shelf, and removed 10 old ones. So he added 3 - 10 = 2 new action figures to his shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially placed x action figures on his bookshelf, and he added 2 new ones later while taking away 7 old ones. So, the current number of action figures on the bookshelf is 10 - 7 + 2 = x + 2. Solve for x to find out how many action figures Jerry initially placed on the bookshelf.
Response:  There are 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on the bookshelf, and 10 books. So there are 16 / 10 = 1.6 times more action figures than books.
Response:  There are 4 books and 6 action figures on Jerry's bookshelf initially. After adding 2 more action figures, there will be a total of 4 + 2 = 6 books and 8 + 2 = 10 action figures on the bookshelf. So, the number of action figures per book is 10/4 = 2.5.
Response:  There are 7 books and 3 action figures on Jerry's bookshelf initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, there are now 7 + 2 = 9 books and 3 + 2 = 5 action figures on the bookshelf. Therefore, there are more books than action figures on the bookshelf by a ratio of 9 : 5 or 3 : 2.
Response:  There are 6 birds sitting on the fence and more birds flying to join them. So, there will be 6 + x (where x is the number of birds flying to join) birds sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  There were initially 3 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 birds (including the sparrows) and 2 pigeons sitting on the trellis initially. When 5 more birds join them, there will be a total of 3 + 5 = 8 birds sitting on the trellis.
Response:  There are 3 birds (sparrows) and 4 pigeons sitting on the rack, and 2 more birds (sparrows or pigeons) will join them. Let X be the number of sparrows and Y be the number of pigeons. We know that X + Y = 3 + 4 = 7 birds in total. Since there are already 3 sparrows, we can set up the equation as follows: X + 2 = 7 - 3 = 4. Solving for X, we get X = 4. Therefore, there are 4 sparrows and 3 pigeons sitting on the rack.
Response:  There are 6 birds (pigeons) sitting on the rack and 3 more birds (sparrows) join them. So, there will be 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the rack in total.
Response:  There are 4 birds (sparrows) and 6 pigeons sitting on the fence. If 2 more pigeons join them, then there will be a total of 4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence (including both sparrows and pigeons). If 6 more pigeons join them, then there will be 7 + 6 = 13 birds in total on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 + 2 = 8 birds sitting on the fence, and 3 + 2 = 5 birds that are not sitting on the fence. So there are 8 - 5 = 3 more birds sitting on the fence than not sitting on it.
Response:  There are 4 birds of one type (sparrows) and 3 birds of another type (pigeons) sitting on the fence. If there are 6 more pigeons added to them, then there will be 4 + 3 = 7 sparrows and 6 + 3 = 9 pigeons sitting on the fence. So, there will be 9 - 7 = 2 more pigeons than sparrows sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 + 4 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 2 birds sitting on the reed rack initially, and then there come 5 birds and 4 storks to join them. So, in total, there are 2 + 5 = 7 birds sitting on the reed rack. Since each stork is equivalent to 4 birds, we have 4 x 4 = 16 birds that are equivalent to the 7 birds. Therefore, there are 7 - 16 = -9 birds more than storks sitting on the reed rack.
Response:  There are 3 birds (birds A) sitting on the fence initially. Then, 2 more birds (birds B) join them, so there are now 3 + 2 = 5 birds in total. Later, 6 more pigeons (pigeons C) join the group, so the total number of birds and pigeons is 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, there are 8 more pigeons than birds.
Response:  There are 5 chickens and 3 birds sitting on the fence. If there are 4 more birds joining them, then there will be a total of 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 12 - 5 = 7 more birds than chickens sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 crickets and 2 birds sitting on the bamboo rack, so there are 6 + 2 = 8 creatures in total. When 3 more birds join them, there will be 8 + 3 = 11 creatures in total. Therefore, there are 6 crickets and 5 birds (3 more than 2) sitting on the bamboo rack.
Response:  There are 3 birds sitting on the telephone wire initially, and then 6 sparrows and 2 more birds (either sparrows or other birds) join them. So, in total, there are 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the telephone wire.

Response:  There were 62 - 39 = 23 more campers kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  The number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon is 61 - 52 = 9 more than the morning.
Response:  There were 15 campers who went kayaking in the morning, and some more campers went kayaking in the afternoon. In total, there were 32 campers who went kayaking that day. To find out how many campers went kayaking in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of campers who went kayaking in the morning from the total number of campers who went kayaking that day. Let's do this:  32 - 15 =?  Answer:  17
Response:  There were 30 露营者 in the morning.
Response:  Total number of campers kayaking = 36 + 13 + 49 = 98.
Response:  The number of campers who went kayaking in the morning is 44 - 39 = 5 more than the number of campers who went kayaking in the afternoon.
Response:  There are 5 more people kayaking in the afternoon than at night.
Response:  The number of campers who went boating in the afternoon is 34 - 10 = 24 more than the number of campers who went boating at night.
Response:  Total number of campers who went kayaking = 13 + 21 = 34.
Response:  There are 29 + 26 = 55 people who went boating in the morning and afternoon respectively. So, there are 55 - 29 = 26 more people who went boating in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  Total number of campers who went kayaking and hiking = 41 + 26 = 67.
Response:  There were 46 campers in total. In the morning, there were 43 campers kayaking, so there were 46 - 43 = 3 campers who did not go kayaking in the morning. In the afternoon, some of the remaining 3 campers went kayaking, but we don't know how many. So, let x be the number of campers who went kayaking in the afternoon. Then, we have 3 + x = 46 (since some of the morning non-kayakers went kayaking in the afternoon). Solving for x, we get x = 13 (since 3 + 13 = 46). Therefore, there were 13 campers who went kayaking in the afternoon.

Response:  Doug has 15 marbles (22 - 7 = 15).
Response:  Doug initially had 5 more marbles than Ed, so Doug had 5 + 27 = 32 marbles. Since Doug lost 3 marbles, he now has 32 - 3 = 29 marbles.
Response:  Ed has 24 + 9 = 33 balls more than Doug.
Response:  Ed had 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  Ed lost 11 marbles (19 - 8 = 11).
Response:  Ed has 91 marbles and lost 21 marbles, so he has 91 - 21 = 70 marbles left. Doug has 30 marbles. Therefore, Ed has 70 > 30 = 40 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  Doug has 12 - 17 = 5 more marbles than Ed.
Response:  There are 408 - 42 = 366 more students who recommend adding potatoes to the menu than students who recommend adding carrots.
Response:  There are 10 more students who suggest adding carrots than those who suggest adding potatoes. Specifically, there are 489 - 479 = 10 more students who suggest adding carrots.
Response:  We can let X be the number of students who suggested adding carrots to the menu and Y be the number of students who suggested adding potatoes. According to the problem, 185 students suggested adding potatoes, so Y = 185. Since there are 310 students in total, we have X + Y = 310. Substituting Y = 185 into this equation gives us: X + 185 = 310. Solving for X, we get: X = 125. Therefore, 125 students suggested adding carrots to the menu.
Response:  There are 14 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu.
Response:  There are 63 more students who prefer to add potato puree than those who prefer to add carrot sticks. To find out how many students prefer to add carrot sticks, we can subtract 63 from the total number of students who made recommendations (457). Therefore, there are 457 - 63 = 394 students who prefer to add carrot sticks.
Response: 166 students recommended adding carrots to the menu.
"Response:  We can add up the number of students who made suggestions for each food item to get the total number of students participating in the new menu project:

324 + 374 + 128 = 826

Therefore, there are 826 students who participated in the new menu project by making suggestions for different food items."
Response:  There are 257 - 120 = 137 more students who recommend adding potatoes to the menu than students who recommend adding carrots.
"Response:  The number of students who recommend adding potatoes (土豆泥) is 144, and the number of students who recommend adding tomatoes (番茄) is 79. To find out how many more students recommend adding potatoes than tomatoes, we can subtract the number of students who recommend adding tomatoes from the number of students who recommend adding potatoes:

144 - 79 = 65

Therefore, there are 65 more students who recommend adding potatoes than tomatoes."
"Response:  The number of students who suggest adding carrots (337) is more than twice the number of students who suggest adding tomatoes (23). Therefore, the difference between the two numbers can be found by multiplying 337 by 2 and subtracting 23 from the result.

So, the difference between the number of students who suggest adding carrots and the number of students who suggest adding tomatoes is:

337 x 2 = 674 - 23 = 651

Therefore, there are 651 more students who suggest adding carrots than students who suggest adding tomatoes."
Response:  There are 38 + 450 = 488 students who have participated in suggesting new food items for the school canteen menu.
"Response:  We can find out how many students suggested adding only potatoes by subtracting the number of students who suggested adding both potatoes and carrots from the total number of students. 

Let X be the number of students who suggested adding only potatoes. Then we have:
X + 351 = 218 + X (since 218 students suggested adding both potatoes and carrots)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 143

Therefore, there are 143 students who suggested adding only potatoes to the menu."
"Response:  To find out how many more students recommended adding potatoes than recommending carrots, we need to subtract the number of students who recommended adding carrots from the number of students who recommended adding potatoes. 

Let's do that:  
Number of students who recommended adding potatoes = 269 
Number of students who recommended adding carrots = 330 - 76 = 254 
Subtracting the two numbers gives us:  
269 - 254 = 15 
Therefore, there are 15 more students who recommended adding potatoes than carrots."
Response:  The school has 569 female students and 236 male students, so the school has 569 + 236 = 785 students in total. Therefore, the school has approximately 785 / 236 = 3.3 times as many female students as male students.
"Response:  The school has 34 female students and 841 male students, so the ratio of female to male students is:

34/841 = 1/24

Therefore, for every one female student, there are 24 male students in the school."
Response:  There are 485 students in total, and 232 of them are female students. Therefore, there are 485 - 232 = 253 male students.
Response:  There are 697 female students and 228 more female students than male students. Therefore, there are 697 + 228 = 925 male students in the school.
"Response:  There are 635 female students and male students combined in this school. Since there are 510 more male students than female students, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:  
Let x be the number of male students. Then, the number of female students is 635 - x. We know that there are 510 more male students than female students, so we can write:  
x + (635 - x) = 510...(1) Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 635 = 510...(2) Subtracting 635 from both sides:  
2x = 495...(3) Dividing by 2:  
x = 247.5...(4) Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us:  
x = 248...(5) Therefore, there are 248 male students in this school."
Response:  The school has 868 + 281 = 1149 students.
Response:  There are 700 female students and 142 more male students than female students, so there are 700 + 142 = 842 students in total.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 706 + 222 = 928. After adding 418 more female students, the new total number of students in the school is 928 + 418 = 1346.
Response:  The total number of female students in the school is 902 + 44 = 946.
Response:  The number of female students is 632 + 465 = 1097, which is more than twice the number of male students (410).
Response:  There are 732 + 682 = 1414 female students in the school now.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of male students as ""m"" and the number of female students as ""f"". We know that initially, there were 214 male students and 135 female students, so we can write: m = 214 and f = 135 Now, we are told that 496 more female students and 910 more male students joined the school. So, we can write: f + 496 = 135 + 496 = 531 and m + 910 = 214 + 910 = 1124 Therefore, the current number of male students is 1124, and the current number of female students is 531."
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 308 + 318 = 626.
Response:  The total number of people in the school is 315 + 309 + 772 = 1496.
"Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of male students in the school. Then we can write an equation based on the information given:  
739 (female students) + x (male students) = total students 402 more female students than male students So, we can rewrite the equation as:  
739 + x = total students + 402 We know that the total number of students is 739 + 402 = 1141 Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
x + 739 = 1141 To solve for x, we can subtract 739 from both sides of the equation:  
x = 1141 - 739 x = 402 The number of male students in the school is 402."
Response:  The school has 692 + 458 = 1150 students.
Response:  The number of female students is 257 + 403 = 660.  Therefore, the school has 362 male students and 660 female students.
Response:  Love Edward has $18 and spent $16, so he still has $18 - $16 = $2 left.
Response:  Love Edward spent $10.
Response:  $25 (20 + 5)
Response:  $16 + (92 x $16) = $16 + $1472 = $1488.
Response:  Each book costs $6. Therefore, the cost of two books is $6 x 2 = $12.
Response:  $35 (19 - 6 = 13 + 16 = 35)
Response:  $4 + $3 = $7.
Response:  Love Edward spent more money on books than on pens. He spent $16 on books and $8 on pens, so he spent a total of $16 + $8 = $24 on books and pens. Since he has $19 left over, he must have had $24 - $19 = $5 more on books than on pens. Therefore, he spent $5 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $17 + $10 = $27.
Response:  Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 push-ups, so together they did  44 + 58 = 102 push-ups.
Response: 扎卡里比大卫多做了7个俯卧撑（51-44=7）。
Response:  Zack did 35 push-ups (9 less than David's 44).
Response:  The total number of push-ups done by David and Zack is 51 + 49 = 100.
Response:  David did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups in total.
"Response:  David did 13 more sit-ups than Zachary.  

Question:  If a bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day at $2 each, how much money does it make in a day? 
Based on the information given, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  The bakery makes $500 per day ($2 x 250 loaves)."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of push-ups done by Zachary as Z and the number of sit-ups done by David as D. We know that Z = 53 (the number of push-ups) and D = 17 (the difference between the number of push-ups done by David and Zachary). We also know that D - 10 (the difference between the number of sit-ups done by David and Zachary). Therefore, we can write an equation to represent the information given in the problem:  
Z + D = 53 + 17 
Z + D - 10 = 53 + 17 - 10 
Z + D = 67 
Solving for Z, we get:  Z = 67 - D 
Therefore, Zachary did 67 push-ups and sit-ups combined, and David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary but 10 fewer sit-ups."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:  
1. Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 sit-ups. 2. David did more than Zachary by 58 push-ups but fewer by 87 sit-ups. To find out how many more push-ups David did than Zachary, we can subtract their numbers:  
35 (Zachary) - 58 = 23 (more push-ups for David)  Since there are 10 push-ups in one set, David did 23 sets of push-ups more than Zachary. Now let's calculate how many more sit-ups David did than Zachary:  
3 (Zachary) - 87 = (-84) (fewer sit-ups for David) As you can see, David did significantly fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So to summarize:  
David did 23 more push-up sets than Zachary, but he did 84 fewer sit-up sets than Zachary."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of push-ups done by Zachary as Z and the number of sit-ups done by David as D. From the problem statement, we know that:  
Z = 46 (push-ups)  
D = 38 + 62 (sit-ups)  
We can simplify the equation as follows:  
D = 38 + 62 = 100  
Now, we can solve for Z in terms of D:  
Z = 46 - 100 = -54  
So, Zachary did 54 fewer sit-ups than David."
Response:  Great! Let's see... David did 39 push-ups, and John did fewer than David by 13 push-ups. So, John did 39 - 13 = 26 push-ups.
"Response:  JOHN DID 38 PUSH-UPS.

Here's how we can arrive at this answer:

ZACHARY (Z) did 51 push-ups today in physical education class.
DAVID (D) did more than ZACHARY by 22 push-ups.
JOHN (J) did less than DAVID by 4 push-ups.
Therefore, JOHN did:
51 - 22 = 39 push-ups (Zachary's difference)
39 - 4 = 35 push-ups (David's difference)
35 + 4 = 39 push-ups (John's total)
So John did 39 push-ups."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of push-ups done by Zachary as Z, the number of push-ups done by David as D, and the number of push-ups done by John as J. We know that:  
Z = 15 (given)  
D = Z + 39 (given)  
J = D - 9 (given)  
We can solve this system of equations to find Z:  
Z = 15  
D = 15 + 39 = 54  
J = 54 - 9 = 45  
So, Zachary did 15 push-ups, David did 54 push-ups, and John did 45 push-ups."
Response:  If David did 37 push-ups and he did 30 more than Carlos, then Carlos did  37 - 30 = 7 push-ups.
Response:  If David did 38 push-ups and Zack did 56 push-ups, then together they did 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups.
Response:  If David did 40 push-ups and fewer sit-ups than Zack, then David did 40 - 17 = 23 sit-ups.  Since Zack did 34 push-ups and 62 sit-ups, David did fewer sit-ups by 62 - 23 = 39 sit-ups.
"Response:  If David did 36 push-ups and fewer sit-ups than Zack, then David did 36 - 33 = 3 more push-ups than sit-ups. 
If Zack did 58 push-ups and 33 sit-ups, then he did 58 - 33 = 25 more push-ups than sit-ups. 
Therefore, Zack did 25 more push-ups than David."
"Response:  If David did 27 push-ups and fewer sit-ups than Zack, then the difference between their number of sit-ups is equal to the number of push-ups David did minus the number of sit-ups he did. In this case, that would be:  

27 - x = 7 

Solving for x gives us: 

x = 20 

So Zack did 20 more sit-ups than David."

Response:  The blue frog jumped 12 inches (12 x 1 = 12) and the grasshopper jumped 9 inches (9 x 1 = 9). To find out how many more inches the blue frog jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract 9 from 12: 12 - 9 = 3. So, the blue frog jumped 3 inches more than the grasshopper.
Response:  The total jump distance of both the grasshopper and the frog is 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The frog jumped 36 inches + 17 inches = 53 inches (or 4 feet 9 inches).
"Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped can be calculated as follows:
Let X = the distance that the mouse jumped.
We know that the frog jumped 18 inches (18 x 12 = 216) farther than the grasshopper.
So, the distance that the frog jumped is:
Frog's distance = Grasshopper's distance + 18 inches
= 25 inches + 18 inches
= 43 inches
We also know that the mouse jumped 2 inches (2 x 12 = 24) fewer than the frog.
So, the distance that the mouse jumped is:
Mouse's distance = Frog's distance - 2 inches
= 43 inches - 2 inches
= 41 inches
Therefore, the mouse jumped 41 inches."
Response:  To find out how many inches old mouse jumped more than cricket, we need to subtract the distance that cricket jumped (19 inches) from the distance that mouse jumped (20 inches). So, old mouse jumped 20 - 19 = 1 inch more than cricket.
Response:  The frog jumped 39 inches (39 + 94 = 133) more than the grasshopper.
"Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped can be calculated as follows:
Let X be the distance that the mouse jumped.
We know that the frog jumped 32 inches more than the grasshopper, so the frog's distance is:
Frog distance = Grasshopper distance + 32 inches
= 25 inches + 32 inches
= 57 inches
The mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's distance is:
Mouse distance = Frog distance - 26 inches
= 57 inches - 26 inches
= 31 inches
Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches."
Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped is 5 inches more than the distance that the grasshopper jumped, so the mouse jumped 29 inches (24 + 5).
"Response:  Let's denote the distance jumped by the green frog as x. We know that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches (x = 13). According to the problem, the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the green frog. So we can set up the equation:

Grasshopper's distance = Green frog's distance + 2 inches

Substituting x for the green frog's distance, we get:

13 = x + 2

Solving for x, we find that the green frog jumped 9 inches (x = 9):

Green frog jumped 9 inches."
Response:  The total distance jumped by both the grasshopper and the frog is 39 inches (35 + 4).
Response:  The frog jumped 48 inches (44 + 4 = 48).
Response:  The distance that the mouse jumped is 12 inches (less than the frog's jump by 12 inches).
"Response:  The distance that the grasshopper jumped over the mouse is = (21 inches) - (16 inches) = 5 inches more than the distance that the frog jumped over the mouse. 

Question:   If Sally can paint a house in 6 hours and John can paint the same house in 4 hours, how long will it take for both of them to paint the house together? 
Based on the information given, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Both Sally and John working together can paint the house in = (6 hours) + (4 hours) = 10 hours."
"Response:  To find out how many inches more the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped (17 inches) from the distance the frog jumped (39 inches):  
39 - 17 = 22 inches  So, the frog jumped 22 inches more than the grasshopper."
Response:  Let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as x. Since the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog, the distance jumped by the mouse is x - 3. The grasshopper jumped 33 inches more than the frog, so the distance jumped by the grasshopper is x + 33. We know that the total distance jumped by all three animals is 9 inches (the distance jumped by the grasshopper), so we can set up the equation: x + (x - 3) + (x + 33) = 9. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 36 = 9, which simplifies to 2x = 6. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. So, the mouse jumped 3 inches.
Response:  Let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as x. Since the mouse jumps less than the frog by 16 inches, we can write: Mouse jump = Frog jump - 16 inches.  We know that the grasshopper jumps 14 inches. So, we can write: Grasshopper jump = Mouse jump + 14 inches. Substituting the expressions for the mouse and frog jumps, we get: Mouse jump = (Frog jump - 16) + 14 inches. Solving for the mouse jump, we get: Mouse jump = Frog jump - 28 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumps 28 inches less than the frog.
Response:  To determine how much more flour Mary needs to add to make the amount of flour equal to the amount of sugar, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added (5 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (14 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 cups of flour (14 - 5 = 9) to make the amount of flour equal to the amount of sugar.
"Response:  To find out how much sugar Mary needs to add to make the amount of sugar greater than the amount of flour, we can subtract the number of cups of flour (4) from the total number of cups of ingredients needed for the recipe (9 + 11 = 20). This gives us:  
20 - 4 = 16  
So, Mary needs to add 16 cups of sugar to make the amount of sugar greater than the amount of flour."
Response:  If Marry needs to use more flour than sugar by 8 cups, then she needs to add (8 - 13) = 5 cups of flour.
Response:  If Marry needs to use more than twice as much flour as sugar, and she has already poured some flour, then she needs to pour 2 times 7 = 14 cups of flour. Since she has already poured some flour, she should pour 14 - x cups of flour, where x is the amount of flour she has already poured.
Response:  To find out how much more flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (3 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (11 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 8 cups of flour (11 - 3 = 8).
"Response:  If Marry needs 2 cups of flour and she has already put some in, then she needs to add 2 - x cups of flour, where x is the amount of flour she has already added. Since she needs 12 cups of flour in total, we can set up the equation as follows:  

2 - x + 12 = 0 
Solving for x, we get: 

x = 10 
Therefore, Mary has already added 10 cups of flour."
Response:  To find out how much more flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract what she has already added (3 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (9 cups). So, she needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Marry needs to add 12 cups of sugar (14 - 2 = 12).
Response:  Marry needs to add 1 more cup of flour (12 - 11 = 1).
Response:  To make the cake batter sweeter than the sugar content, Marry needs to add more flour. She has already added 7 cups of flour and needs to add an additional (10 - 7) = 3 cups of flour to make it sweeter than the sugar content.
Response:  To make the cake batter have more flour than salt, Marry needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 cups of flour.
Response:  Based on the given information, Marry needs to add more sugar (8 - 5 = 3 cups) than salt (7 - 5 = 2 cups).
Response:  To find out how many cups of sugar Marry needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (13 cups). Therefore, Marry needs to add 13 - 2 = 11 more cups of sugar.
Response:  Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5) more than she has already added.
Response:  To make the cake batter sweeter than the sugar content, Marry needs to add more flour than she has already added (2 cups). Since the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and she has already added 2 cups, she needs to add an additional 7 cups of flour.
"Response:  To find out how much sugar Marry needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (11 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (14 cups). This gives us:  

14 - 11 = 3 cups 
So, Mary needs to add 3 cups of sugar to her cake batter."
Response:  If Marry needs to add more flour than sugar, and she has already added some flour, then she needs to add 5 cups of flour minus the amount of flour she has already added. Let x be the number of cups of flour Mary has already added. Then, she needs to add 5 - x cups of flour.
Response:  If Marry needs 12 cups of flour and she has already put some cups of flour, then she needs to add 12 - x cups of flour, where x is the number of cups of flour she has already put. Since she needs 13 cups of flour in total, we can set up the equation as follows:  12 - x + 13 = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 1 cup of flour. Therefore, Mary has already put 1 cup of flour.
Response:  To find out how much more flour Marry needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (7 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (14 cups). Therefore, Marry needs to add 7 cups - 6 cups = 1 cup more flour.
"Response:  To find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar and flour she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. Let's do that:  
Total sugar required = 11 cups + 9 cups = 20 cups  
Mary has already added = 12 cups (flour) + 10 cups (sugar) = 22 cups  
Now, let's subtract the amount Mary has already added from the total amount required:  
Subtracting 22 cups from 20 cups gives us:  
20 - 22 = -2 cups  
So, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar to the batter."
Response:  To find out how much more flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract what she has already added (6 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (10 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 4 cups of flour.
Response:  To make the cake batter sweeter than the sugar, Marry needs to add more flour than the amount of sugar she has added. Since she has already added 4 cups of flour and wants the cake to be sweeter than the sugar, she should add an additional (9 - 4) = 5 cups of flour.
Response:  To make the cake batter sweeter than saltier, Mary needs to add more sugar (9 cups) than salt (4 cups). Since she has already added 2 cups of flour, she needs to add 7 cups of flour to make the cake batter sweeter than saltier.
"Response:  To determine how much sugar and salt to add, we need to use ratios. Let's say the ratio of sugar to salt is 3:2 (three parts sugar to two parts salt). We know that Marry needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt. So, if we set up a proportion based on this ratio, we get:  

Sugar : Salt = 3 : 2 

Now, let's substitute the values we know into the proportion:  

11/3 = X/2 

Where X is the amount of salt she needs to add. Solving for X, we get:  

X = 2(11) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7 

So, Mary needs to add 7 cups of salt."
Response:  To find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already added (4 cups) from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe (7 cups). So, she needs to add 3 more cups of sugar.
Response:  To find out how much more flour Mary needs to add to make the amount of sugar she has added equal to the total amount of flour and sugar, we can use subtraction. Let's subtract the number of cups of sugar Mary has already added (10) from the total amount of cups of flour and sugar required (12 + 14 = 26):  26 - 10 = 16 Therefore, Mary needs to add 16 / 2 = 8 more cups of flour to make the mixture equal in both ingredients.
Response:  There are 19 bird families living at the foot of the mountain, and 60 bird families migrate over winter, so there are 60 - 19 = 41 more bird families that migrate over winter than stay behind.
Response:  There are 87 bird families at the foot of the mountain, and 7 bird families migrate over winter. Therefore, there are 87 - 7 = 80 bird families that stay in the area during winter.
Response:  There were initially 20 bird families living in the mountains.
Response:  There are 85 bird families at the foot of the mountain, and 23 families fly to Africa, leaving 62 families (85 - 23 = 62) remaining in the mountain area.
Response:  There are 8 bird families living at the foot of the mountain, and 42 bird families fly to Africa, so there are 8 + 42 = 50 bird families flying to Africa. Similarly, there are 31 bird families flying to Asia, so there are 31 - 8 = 23 bird families more flying to Asia than to Africa.
"Response:  The number of bird families flying to Asia is 94, and the number of bird families flying to Africa is 47. To find out how many more bird families are flying to Asia than to Africa, we can subtract the smaller number from the larger number:

94 - 47 = 47

So, there are 47 more bird families flying to Asia than to Africa."
Response:  There are 18 bird families living at the foot of the mountain, and 38 birds fly to Africa, so there are 18 - 38 = 20 bird families that do not migrate to Africa. Similarly, there are 80 birds flying to Asia, so there are 18 - 80 = 62 bird families that do not migrate to Asia. Therefore, there are 20 + 62 = 82 bird families that stay in their original place during winter.
Response:  There will be 87 + 18 = 105 bird families living in the mountain area after the new birds join.
"Response:  There are 49 bird families at the foot of the mountain before winter.
59 bird families migrate over winter, leaving 49 - 59 = 10 bird families at the foot of the mountain after winter.
In addition, 24 new bird families come from the North Pole to live at the foot of the mountain, so there are 10 + 24 = 34 bird families at the foot of the mountain after winter."
Response:  There are 41 bird families initially living near the mountain, and 27 of them migrate to warmer countries for winter. Therefore, there are 41 - 27 = 14 bird families still living near the mountain after the migration.
Response:  There are 86 - 45 = 41 bird families that migrate over winter.
"Response:  There are 41 bird families in the mountainous area. If 35 bird families fly to Asia and 62 bird families fly to Africa, then the number of bird families flying to Africa is:

41 - 35 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 more bird families flying to Africa than to Asia."
Response:  There are 3 groups of birds living near the mountain, and 26 new bird species have arrived from the North Pole. If 2 groups of birds fly south for the winter, then there are 3 - 2 = 1 group of birds left in the area.
Response:  Paul has 253 pencils at the beginning of the school year and loses or gives away 70 of them by the end of the year. Therefore, he has 253 - 70 = 183 pencils left at the end of the year.
Response:  Paul received 551 pencils as a birthday gift and lost or gave away 374 pencils (551 - 177) during the school year. Therefore, he had 177 pencils left at the end of the school year.
"Response:  Paul has 440 pencils in total and he gave away 111 of them to his friends. He also lost 106 pencils, so he is left with:  
440 - 111 - 106 = 223 pencils."
Response:  Based on the information provided, Paul had 65 pens at first and gave away 213 pens during the school year. He also lost 16 pens, so he has (65 - 213 + 16) = 47 pens left.
"Response:  Paul gave his friends 571 pens, which is more than the 161 pens he lost. So, the difference between the number of pens given to friends and the number of pens lost is:  
571 - 161 = 410 pens."
Response:  Based on the information provided, Paul has 110 pens and gave 90 pens to his friends, so he has 110 - 90 = 20 pens left. He lost 412 pens, so he lost more than twice as many pens as he had left (412 > 2 x 20).
Response:  Paul received 563 pencils as a birthday gift and gave away 558 of them to his friends. If he only has 332 pencils left, then he received 563 - 332 = 231 pencils as a birthday gift.
Response:  Paul has 492 pens left and he gave 52 pens to his friends during the school year. Therefore, he lost or sent out 535 - 492 = 43 pens.
Response:  There are 367 missing pens (521 - 154 = 367).
Response:  Paul has 391 pens left at the end of the school year, and he had 531 pens at the beginning of the year. To find out how many pens he lost, we can subtract the number of pens he had at the beginning of the year from the number of pens he has left:  531 - 391 = 140.  Therefore, Paul lost 140 pens during the school year.
Response:  Paul has 336 - 406 = 70 more erasers than pencils.
Response:  Paul received 315 pencils as birthday gifts and had 291 left at the end of the school year, so he lost or gave away 24 pencils (315 - 291 = 24).
"Response:  Paul received 267 pencils in total and lost 231 of them. He gave 308 pencils to his friends, which is more than he lost. So, the difference between the number of pencils he gave to his friends and the number of pencils he lost is:  

308 - 231 = 77"
"Response:  Paul has 523 erasers left at the end of the school year, and he had received 457 rubber bands and 320 pencils. To find out how many more pencils he has than rubber bands, we can subtract the number of rubber bands from the total number of pencils:  
523 - 457 =? 
Answer:  66"
Response:  The number of customers who left is 8 (11 - 3 = 8).
Response:  The number of customers who stayed is 4 - 3 = 1 more than the number of customers who left.
"Response:  Let x be the number of customers at first. Then we know that after 9 customers leave, he has 12 - 9 = 3 customers left. So we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 12... (1)

We also know that x is positive, so we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

x + 4 = 13... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:

x = 8... (3)

So there were 8 customers at first."
Response: 9 (14 - 5 = 9)
"Response:  Let x be the number of customers who left. Then we know that the original number of customers was 13 - x, and after some customers left, there were 9 new customers added, so the total number of customers now is:  
13 - x + 9 =?  
Can you solve for x?"
Response:  The service staff has 12 customers initially and loses 15 customers, leaving him with 12 - 15 = 3 customers. Then he receives 14 new customers, so he now has 3 + 14 = 17 customers.
"Response:  There were 5 new customers who arrived.  
Explanation: The service staff had 3 customers initially, and then 8 customers in total (including the initial 3). So, the difference between the total number of customers and the initial number of customers is 8 - 3 = 5, which means that there were 5 new customers who arrived."
Response:  Let x be the number of customers who left. Then we know that the original number of customers was 8 + x = 8x. After some customers left, there were 5 customers remaining, so we can set up the equation:  8x - x = 5. Simplifying this equation, we get:  7x = 40. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 6. So, 6 customers left.
"Response:  The service staff has 14 customers after some customers leave and then he gets 10 new customers, so the total number of customers now is:

14 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the service staff currently has 24 customers."
Response:  He had $5 before buying the candy ($5 - $2 = $3).
"Response:  The price of the candy is $1. 
Explanation:  Let's call the cost of one piece of candy x. We know that the boy spent $4 - x on the candy and has $3 left, so we can set up the equation:

4 - x = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

So, the price of one piece of candy is $1."
Response:  $4 - (99 x 3) = $4 - 297 = $103.
Response:  $1.50 per candy stick.
"Response:  Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of candy bars purchased. Since each candy bar costs $3, we can write an equation based on the information given:  3x = 2(6) x = 12 x = 12/3 x = 4 So, the student bought 4 candy bars."
Response:  He has $7 - 2 = $5 left after buying the candy and chocolate.
Response:  $13 (7 + 6)
"Response:  The cost of buying candy is $6, and the cost of buying chocolate is $3, so the difference between the two costs is:

$6 - $3 = $3

Therefore, the boy spent $3 more on candy than on chocolate."
Response:  He spent $2 + $3 = $5 on candy and chocolate, so he spent $5 - $2 = $3 more on chocolate than on candy.
Response:  The amount of money left is $4 - $8 + $5 = $1.
Response:  The price of the candy is $3.
Response:  $1 (he has $1 left after buying 10 candies with $3)
Response:  Each piece of candy costs $2.
Response:  The difference between buying candy and chocolate is $4 (7 - 3 = 4).
Response:  The cost of buying chocolate is $7, and the cost of buying candy is $2. To find out how much more the chocolate costs than the candy, we can subtract the cost of the candy from the cost of the chocolate: $7 - $2 = $5. So, the chocolate costs $5 more than the candy.
Response:  Paul has 115 books and sells 78 of them in his car trunk sale. Therefore, he has 115 - 78 = 37 books left.
"Response:  Paul had x books initially, where x is the number of books he had before selling 137 books in the garage sale. After selling 137 books, he has 105 books left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 137 = 105

Solve for x to find out how many books Paul had initially."
Response:  Paul sold 73 books in the car boot sale (108 - 35 = 73).
Response:  Paul bought 36 books (151 - 50 = 36).
Response:  Paul has 58 books now and he sold some of his original 2 books during the car boot sale, so he must have sold at least 2 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold is 2.
Response:  Paul sold more books than he bought. He sold 21 - 15 = 6 books more than he bought.
Response:  Paul bought more books than he sold. He bought 38 new books and sold some books, so the difference between the number of books he bought and the number of books he sold is the number of extra books he has. Let's call the number of books he sold x. Then, the number of books he has now is 38 + x. Since he started with 71 books, we know that 71 - x = 38 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 24. So, Paul has 24 more books than he sold.
Response:  Paul sold 42 books in the car sale.
Response:  Paul sold 92 pens (106 - 14 = 92).
Response:  If Paul had 136 books initially and sold some of them in the car park, then he has 27 books left. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books left from the initial number of books:  136 - 27 = 109.  Therefore, Paul sold 109 books.
"Response:  Paul sold 39 books to his friend and then sold some books in the car boot sale, leaving him with 68 books. To find out how many books he sold in the car boot sale, we can subtract the number of books he has left from the total number of books he had:  
68 - 39 = 29 
So, Paul sold 29 books in the car boot sale."
Response:  Paul sold 110 books in the car boot sale.
Response:  Paul sold 19 - 11 = 8 supports of steel pens in the car-boot sale.
Response:  There are 2 roses left in Jessica's garden.
"Response:  There were initially x roses in the vase, and Jessica added 16 more. So, the total number of roses now is x + 16 = 23. We can set up an equation to solve for x:
x + 16 = 23
Subtracting 16 from both sides gives us:
x = 7
Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase initially."
Response:  Jessica cut 17 roses from her garden and put them in the vase with the 2 original roses already there, so she cut 17 + 2 = 19 roses in total.
Response:  Jessica cut more than she threw away because 17 - 3 = 14 more flowers were left in the vase after she was done cutting and throwing away.
Response:  Jessica threw away 34 roses and cut 15 new ones from the garden, so she threw away more than she cut. The difference between the two is 34 - 15 = 19.
Response:  Jessica cut 39 roses from her garden (59 - 20 = 39).
Response:  There are 9 roses left in the garden.
Response:  Jessica cut 13 玫瑰 (15 - 96 = 13).
Response:  Jessica cut 18 roses (21 - 12 = 18).
Response:  There are 12 roses in the vase now, and only 2 lilies. So there are 12 - 2 = 10 more roses than lilies.
Response:  The number of daisies in the vase is 20 - 7 = 13 more than the number of roses.
Response:  Jessica cut  16 (19 - 3) roses from the garden and put them in the flower pot.
Response:  Jessica cut 13 - 14 = 1 fewer rose.
Response:  Jessica cut 3 - 7 = 2 fewer lilies (since there are already 7 in the vase).
Response:  There are 22 roses in the vase, and there are 21 lilies. The number of roses is greater than the number of lilies by 22 - 21 = 1.
"Response:  There are 13 roses in the vase now, and there were 9 originally, so there are 4 more roses now (13 - 9 = 4). 
There are 18 lilies in the vase now, and there were 6 originally, so there are 12 more lilies now (18 - 6 = 12)."
Response:  To find out how many inches of hair Robyn cut off, we need to subtract her original hair length (17 inches) from her current hair length (13 inches). So, she cut off 4 inches of hair (17 - 13 = 4).
Response:  If Robin cut off 20 inches of her hair and now her hair is 10 inches long, then she cut off 20 - 10 = 10 inches of her previous hair length.
Response:  The length of Robin's hair now is 12 + 11 = 23 inches.
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and she grows it an additional 18 inches, her hair will be 37 inches (19 + 18) long.
Response:  The length of her hair now is 14 - 13 = 1 inch or 2.54 cm.
"Response:  The length of Robyn's hair after she cut off 20 inches is equal to the original length (14 inches) minus the amount she grew (8 inches), so her current hair length is:

14 - 8 = 6 inches

Therefore, Robyn's hair is currently 6 inches long."
"Response:  The number of bottle caps found in the park is 53. To find out how many more bottle caps are left in Dan's collection, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps found in the park from the total number of bottle caps in Dan's collection. So, the difference between 12 (the number of bottle caps in Dan's collection) and 53 (the number of bottle caps found in the park) is:

12 - 53 = -41

Therefore, Dan has 41 fewer bottle caps than he had before."
Response:  If 丹尼 has 21 bottle caps in his collection and finds 36 more in the park, then he now has a total of 53 bottle caps.
Response:  At first, Dan had 63 bottle caps.
Response: 11 (the number of new bottle caps he found minus the number of old ones he threw away).
Response:  The number of bottle caps that Danie threw away is 63 - 30 = 33 more than the number of bottle caps he found in the park.
Response:  At first, Dan had 22 bottle caps and no packaging papers.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Dan had 30 packaging papers at first.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Dan found 30 bottle caps and 14 packaging papers in the park. He now has 7 bottle caps and 86 packaging papers in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps he found for each packaging paper, we can divide the number of bottle caps by the number of packaging papers: 30 / 14 = 2.14 (approximately). So, Dan found about 2.14 bottle caps for each packaging paper.
"Response:  To find out how many more packaging papers Dan found than bottle caps, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of packaging papers he has. So, the difference is:  
51 - 11 = 40.  Therefore, Dan found 40 more packaging papers than bottle caps."
"Response:  There are 28 p bottle caps and 16 packaging papers in Dan's collection now. To find out how many more bottle caps there are than packaging papers, we can subtract the number of packaging papers from the number of bottle caps:  

28 - 16 =? 

Answer: 12"
"Response:  To find out how many more packaging papers Dan has than bottle caps, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he has from the total number of packaging papers he has. So, if Dan has 27 bottle caps and 43 packaging papers, we can calculate as follows:  
Number of packaging papers - Number of bottle caps = 43 - 27 = 16  
Therefore, Dan has 16 more packaging papers than bottle caps."
Response:  To find out how many bottle caps Dan had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he lost (66) from the number of bottle caps he has now (25). So, Dan had 25 - 66 = 41 bottle caps at first.
Response:  If Dan had 25 bottle caps in his collection before he went to the park and found 32 more, then he has a total of 25 + 32 = 57 bottle caps now.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Dan had 60 old bottle caps at first.
Response: 44 (50 - 6 = 44)
Response:  The number of old bottle caps that Danie threw away is 54.
Response:  At first, Dan had 82 bottle caps and 29 packages. Therefore, he had a total of 82 + 29 = 111 items in his collection.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Dan had 68 packaging papers and 39 bottle caps at first.
Response:  The number of bottle caps found by Danny is 50 - 21 = 29 more than the number of packaging papers found.
Response:  There are 9 packaging papers in Dan's collection, and he has found 65 packages in the park. Therefore, for every 7 bottle caps he collects, he finds 1 package paper. So, he has found 65 / 7 = 9 more packaging papers than bottle caps.
"Response:  There are 11 packages of wrapping paper and 12 bottle caps in Dan's collection. To find out how many bottle caps there are for each package of wrapping paper, we can divide the number of bottle caps by the number of packages: 

12 (bottle caps) / 11 (packages) = 1.09 or approximately 1.1 bottle caps per package."
"Response:  There are 67 packaging papers and 35 bottle caps in Dan's collection. To find out how many packaging papers there are compared to bottle caps, we can divide the number of packaging papers by the number of bottle caps:

67 / 35 = 2

So, there are twice as many packaging papers as bottle caps in Dan's collection."
Response:  If Jack has 17 cherries and Jill has 11 cherries, then Jill has 6 fewer cherries than Jack.
Response:  Jack has 7 + 15 = 22 peanuts.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Jack has 18 fewer cherries than Steve, and Steve has 13 more cherries than Gil. Let's start by writing down what we know:

Jack has x cherries (since he has 18 fewer than Steve)
Steve has x + 13 cherries (since he has 13 more than Gil)
Gil has x + 13 - 18 = x + 5 cherries (since there are 18 fewer in Jack's bag than in Steve's)

Now we can set up an equation based on these statements:

x + 5 = x + 13

Solving for x, we get:

x = 20

So, Gil has 20 cherries."
"Response:  Jack has 3 fewer cherries than Stephen, and Stephen has 8 more cherries than Gil. If Stephen has 5 cherries, then we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let J represent Jack's number of cherries.
S represents Stephen's number of cherries.
G represents Gil's number of cherries.

From the problem statement, we know that S = 5 + (J - 3) and G = S - 8.

Substituting S = 5 + (J - 3), we get:

G = 5 + (J - 3) - 8

Simplifying, we get:

G = J - 11

So, if Stephen has 5 cherries, then Gil has one less cherry than Stephen minus 11."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Jack has 12 - 4 = 8 cherries, Stephen has 11 - 4 = 7 cherries, and Gill has x cherries (where x is the number of cherries that Gill has more than Jack). We can set up an equation based on this information:

8 + 7 + x = 30...(1)

Since there are 30 cherries in total, we can simplify the equation as follows:

8 + 7 + x = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

Therefore, Gill has 5 more cherries than Jack."
Response:  Jack has 7 + 16 = 23 cherries.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of cherries Jack has as x. Since Jack has 7 cherries less than Steve, we can write an equation based on that:

x = 17 - 7

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So Jack has 10 cherries."
Response:  Jack has 9 fewer peanuts than Jill, and Jill has 18 more peanuts than Steve. So, Steve has 16 peanuts. Therefore, Steve has 16 - 9 = 7 peanuts less than Jill.
"Response:  If Jack has 6 fewer cherries than Steve and Steve has 18 more cherries than Gil, then we can set up an equation to represent this information as follows:
Let J be the number of cherries that Jack has.
Then, Steve has 18 + J = 18 + 6 = 24 cherries.
Gil has 5 cherries.
So, we can write the equation:
J + 5 = 24... (1)
Now, solve for J by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
J + 5 - 5 = 24 - 5
J = 19
Therefore, Jack has 19 cherries."
"Response:  If Jack has 5 fewer cherries than Steve and Steve has 18 more cherries than Gil, then we can set up an equation to represent this information as follows:
Let J be the number of cherries Jack has.
Let S be the number of cherries Steve has.
Let G be the number of cherries Gil has.
We know that J = S - 5 and S = G + 18.
Now we can substitute these expressions into each other to get:
J = S - 5
S = G + 18
Substituting the first equation into the second gives us:
J = (G + 18) - 5
Simplifying this expression gives us:
J = G + 13
So Jack has 13 cherries."
"Response:  If Jack has 16 cherries and Steve has 15 cherries, then together they have 31 cherries. If Gil has 12 cherries, then he has fewer cherries than both Jack and Steve combined. Therefore, the difference between the number of cherries that Gil has and the total number of cherries that Jack and Steve have is:  
31 - 12 = 19."
Response:  Jack has 12 - 19 = 7 fewer peaches than Stephen.
Response:  Jack has 3 more apples than Stephen, so Jack has 8 + 3 = 11 apples in total.
Response:  Jack has 17 peaches and 16 apples, so he has 17 - 16 = 1 more peach than apple.
"Response:  Jack has 12 peaches and 15 apples. He has 3 more peaches than Steve. So, Steve has 12 - 3 = 9 peaches. Now, we can compare the number of apples with the number of peaches:  
Steve has 15 apples and 9 peaches, so he has 6 more apples than peaches."
Response:  Let's denote the number of cherries Jack has as J, and the number of cherries Steve has as S. We know that J = S - 4 and S = G + 67, where G is the number of cherries Gil has. From the first equation, we get: J = S - 4 S = S - 4 + 4 S = S + 4 Now we substitute the second equation into the first one: (S + 4) = S - 4 + 4 (S + 4) = S + 4 + 4 We simplify: 2S + 4 = S + 4 + 4 2S = 5S + 16 Simplify further: 3S = 16 + 16 3S = 32 Divide both sides by 3: S = 10 + 4 S = 14 Now we find Jack's cherries: J = S - 4 J = 14 - 4 J = 10 Finally, we find Gil's cherries: G = J + 67 G = 10 + 67 G = 77
"Response:  Let's denote the number of cherries Jack has as J, and the number of cherries Steve has as S. We know that Jack has 12 fewer cherries than Steve, so we can write an equation based on that:
J = S - 12... (1)
We also know that Steve has 8 more cherries than Gil, so we can write another equation based on that:
S = G + 8... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (J and G). Solving the system of equations, we get:
G = 24... (3)
J = 6... (4)
Therefore, Jack has 6 cherries, Steve has 24 + 8 = 32 cherries, and Gil has 24 cherries."
"Response:  Jack has x number of cherries. Let's use ""x"" to represent the value of jack's cherries. We know that Steve has 19 cherries and Jill has 72 cherries. To find out how many cherries Jack has, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. Here is the equation:

Steve has 19 cherries, so let's write that as:

19 = x + 12

This equation states that Steve has 19 cherries, and if we add 12 to his total, we get the number of cherries Jack has. Now we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

19 - 12 = x + 12 - 12

This simplifies to:

7 = x

So, Jack has 7 cherries."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of cherries Jack has as J, and the number of cherries Steve has as S. We know that Jack has 6 fewer cherries than Steve, so we can write an equation based on that:
J = S - 6
We also know that Jack has 3 more cherries than Gil, so we can write another equation based on that:
J = G + 3
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (J and G). Can you solve for J and then find out how many cherries Gil has?"
Response:  Jack has 10 more peaches than Stephen, so Jack has 13 + 10 = 23 peaches in total.
Response:  Jack has 13 - 17 = 4 more apples than Stephen. Therefore, Jack has 4 + 12 = 16 apples in total.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, Jack has 8 fewer cherries than Stephen, and Stephen has 10 more apples than Jack. Let's use ""C"" to represent the number of cherries Jack has, and ""A"" to represent the number of apples Stephen has. We know that C = A - 8, since Jack has 8 fewer cherries than Stephen. Also, we know that A = C + 10, since Stephen has 10 more apples than Jack. Now we can set up an equation using these two statements: C = A - 8 A = C + 10 Solving for C, we get: C = (A - 8) + 10 C = A - 8 + 10 C = A + 2 Substituting A = 18 (since Stephen has 18 apples), we get: C = 18 - 8 + 2 C = 18 + 2 C = 20 So Jack has 20 cherries."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, Jack has 15 peaches and 19 apples. To find out how many more apples he has than peaches, we can subtract the number of peaches from the number of apples: 
19 - 15 = 4. So Jack has 4 more apples than peaches."

Question:   奥利维亡从ATM机上取了49美元，并将其分配给了两个人：一个是25美元，另一个是24美元。她现在剩下多少钱？ 
Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: $21 (calculation below)"
"Response:  $91 - $53 = $38  
Explanation:  To find out how much more Olive spent at the supermarket than she withdrew from the ATM, we need to subtract the amount of money she had in her purse ($53) from the amount she withdrew from the ATM ($91). This gives us $38, which is the difference between the two amounts."
"Response:  Olive spent $49 at the museum and $x at the supermarket, where x is the amount she spent at the supermarket. We know that she had $106 to begin with and ended up with $26, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

$106 - x = $26

Solve for x by subtracting $106 from both sides of the equation:

x = $106 - $26

x = $80

Therefore, Olive spent $80 at the supermarket."
Response:  Olive spent $25 ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  If 奥利维亚 spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet initially, then she has $128 - $38 = $90 left in her wallet.
Response:  There are 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on David's phone after he deleted 5 apps.
"Response:  There were initially x applications on the phone, and after deleting 18 of them, there were only 5 left. So we can set up an equation as follows:

x - 18 = 5... (1)

Solve for x to find out how many applications were initially present on the phone.

Answer: x = 23"
Response:  He deleted 7 applications (11 - 4 = 7).
Response:  He added 89 - 24 = 65 more applications than he deleted.
"Response:  The number of new applications added (71) is greater than the number of applications deleted (less than 14). So, the difference between the two numbers is:

71 - 14 = 57

Therefore, the number of applications deleted is 57 fewer than the number of applications added."
Response:  He deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11).
Response:  He deleted 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
Response:  The number of remaining applications is 21, and the number of remaining files is 4. So, the ratio of remaining applications to remaining files is 21/4 = 5.
Response:  The number of files left on the phone is 15. 
Response:  The number of applications added by David is = 18 - 17 = 1.
Response:  He deleted 5 applications.
Response:  He deleted 3 files.
Response:  The number of remaining applications is 12, and the number of remaining files is 5. Therefore, the ratio of remaining applications to remaining files is 12/5 = 2.
Response:  The number of files left on the phone is 24, and the number of applications left is 2. So, there are 24/2 = 12 times more files than applications left on the phone.
Response:  Nell 还剩下206张卡（242-136=206）。
Response:  Nell had 301 cards initially and gave 301 cards to Jeff, so she has 154 cards left now.
"Response:  Nell gave Jeff x cards. Now she has 252 - x cards left. 

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Let b be the cost of the ball. Then the cost of the bat is $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat is b + $1.00. Together, they cost $1.10, so we can set up the equation:  
b + (b + $1.00) = $1.10. Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2b + $1.00 = $1.10. Subtracting $1.00 from both sides gives us:  
2b = $0.10. Dividing by 2 gives us:  
b = $0.05. So the ball costs $0.05."
Response:  Jeff has  234 +  535 = 769 cards now.
"Response:  To find out how many baseball cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of 10 cards she gave him from the total number of 10 cards she had. Let's do that:  

Total number of 10 cards = 356  
Number of 10 cards given to Jeff = 149  
Therefore, Number of 10 cards left with Nell = Total - Given = 356 - 149 = 207  
Now, let's find out how many baseball cards Nell has left by subtracting the number of 10 cards she has left from the total number of baseball cards she had:  

Total number of baseball cards = 309 + 207 = 516  
Therefore, Number of baseball cards left with Nell = Total - Given = 516 - 309 = 207  
So, Nell has 207 baseball cards and 207 10-card packs left after giving some to Jeff."
"Response:  To find out how many more 10 cards Nell has than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the total number of 10 cards she has.  

Number of 10 cards = 495  
Number of baseball cards = 404  
Subtracting the two numbers gives us:  
495 - 404 = 91  
Therefore, Nell has 91 more 10 cards than baseball cards."
Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that Nell has 573 cards in total and gave 195 cards to John. This means she has 573 - 195 = 378 cards left. She also gave some cards to Jeff, but the exact number is not specified. So, we can set up an equation as follows:  378 - x = 210 Where x is the number of cards given to Jeff. Solving for x, we get:  x = 168 Therefore, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.
"Response:  To find out how many baseball cards Nell has left after giving some to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs she gave him from the total number of 10-card packs she had. Let's do that:  
55 (remaining 10-card packs) = 18 (number of 10-card packs given to Jeff) + x (number of baseball cards remaining with Nell)  Where x is the number of baseball cards remaining with Nell. Now solve for x:  x = 55 - 18 = 37  So, Nell has 37 baseball cards remaining after giving some to Jeff."
"Response:  To find out how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has from the total number of 10-card packs she has.  
Let's start by finding out how many 10-card packs Nell has:  
She has 376 10-card packs (since each pack contains 10 cards). Now, let's find out how many baseball cards she has:  
She has 111 baseball cards (since there are 111 cards in her collection). Now, let's subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of 10-card packs to find out how many more 10-card packs she has:  
Subtracting 111 from 376 gives us:  
376 - 111 = 265 So, Nell has 265 more 10-card packs than baseball cards."
Response:  Paco had 35 - 19 = 16 pieces of crackers left.
"Response:  Pako has 28 crackers and he ate some of them, leaving 7 crackers left. Let x be the number of crackers that Pako ate. Then we can set up the equation:  
28 - x = 7 
Solve for x by subtracting 28 from both sides:  
x = 21 
Therefore, Pako ate 21 crackers."
Response:  Pako has 40 crackers and he ate 2 of them. Then he bought 37 more crackers. So, Pako still has 40 - 2 - 37 = 1 crackers left.
Response:  The number of pieces of crackers that Paco ate is 5 + 3 = 8.
Response:  The number of additional cookies Paco bought is 36 - 2 = 34.
Response:  Pako has 40 crackers and he eats 5 of them, giving 13 to his friend. So, Pako has 40 - 5 + 13 = 28 crackers left.
Response:  The number of cookies Paco ate that he did not give to his friends is 3 (14 - 13 = 3).
Response:  The number of pieces of bread given to his friend is 21 - 16 = 5 more than the number of pieces he ate.
Response:  Paco still has 22 - 15 = 7 remaining sweet biscuits and 75 - 54 = 21 remaining savory crackers.

Response:  The total weight of their strawberries is 8 + 32 = 40 pounds (or 18.14 kg).
Response:  The weight of the father's strawberries is 24 - 9 = 15 pounds (since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries).
Response:  The weight of 马可's father's grasshopper is 8 pounds (8 lbs).
Response:  The weight of grasshoppers collected by Mao's father is 30 pounds (30 lbs).
Response:  Based on the information provided, if 马可's strawberries weigh 15 pounds and they have a total of 37 pounds of strawberries, then 马可's father's strawberries must weigh 37 - 15 = 22 pounds.
Response:  If 马可 (Ma Ke) and his father together have 17 pounds of strawberries, and Ma Ke's strawberries weigh 30 pounds, then Ma Ke's strawberries are heavier than his father's by 30 - 17 = 13 pounds.
Response:  If 马可's strawberries weigh 10 pounds and they together weigh 26 pounds, then his father's strawberries must weigh 26 - 10 = 16 pounds.
Response:  If 马可 (Ma Ke) and his father together have 30 pounds of strawberries, and Ma Ke's father's strawberries weigh 11 pounds, then Ma Ke's strawberries must weigh 30 - 11 = 19 pounds.
Response:  There are 8 children at the bus station who have not yet boarded the bus.
Response:  There are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus now.
Response:  There were 39 children on the bus before it stopped at the station.
"Response:  There are 21 children left on the bus after some of them got off at the station. To find out how many children got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children who remained on the bus (21) from the total number of children initially (43). Therefore, the answer is:  
43 - 21 = 22 
So, 22 children got off the bus at the station."
"Response:  There were 41 children in total on the public bus before some of them got off at the station. After some children got off, there were 18 children left on the bus. To find out how many more children were on the bus before they got off, subtract the number of children who got off (18) from the total number of children (41): 

41 - 18 =?"
Response:  There are 16 children left on the bus after 10 children got off and some others boarded the bus at the station. So, 16 - 10 = 6 children got on the bus at the station.
"Response:  There are 14 children in total on the bus after some children got off and others got on. Let's say x children got off the bus and y children got on the bus. Then we can write an equation based on the information given:

x + y = 14 (since there are 14 children in total)

We know that 63 children got off the bus, so we can set up another equation:

x = 63 - y (since 63 children got off the bus and y children got on)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the second equation for y:

y = 63 - x

Next, substitute the expression for y into the first equation:

x + (63 - x) = 14

Expand and simplify:

2x + 63 = 14

Subtract 63 from both sides:

2x = 77

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 38

So there were 38 children who got off the bus. Now we can find out how many children got on the bus by substituting x into the second equation:

y = 63 - x

y = 63 - 38

y = 25

Therefore, 25 children got on the bus."
Response:  There are 12 children who got off the bus and 36 children who boarded the bus, so there were 36 - 12 = 24 children who rode the bus.
Response:  There are 22 children in total on the bus. If there were 40 children boarding the bus and some got off, then the number of children getting off must be equal to the difference between 40 and 22, which is 18 (40 - 22 = 18). Therefore, there are 18 children who got off the bus at the station.
"Response:  There are 30 children on the public bus, and 82 children got on the bus at the station. To find out how many more children got on the bus than got off, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who got on. So, we can calculate as follows:  
Total number of children who got on = 82  
Number of children who got off =? (we don't know this information)  
Subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children who got on gives us:  
30 = 82 -?  
Solving for?, we get:  
? = 52  
So, there were 52 more children who got on the bus than got off."
Response:  There are 8 children left on the bus after some children got off. Since there were originally 23 children on the bus and 24 children boarded the bus, we can deduce that 1 child did not get on the bus (24 - 23 = 1). Therefore, 1 child got off the bus.
Response:  If the baker sold 51 of the 133 cakes he made, then he has 82 cakes left (133 - 51 = 82).
Response:  If the baker has 13 egg tarts left and he sold some of them, then he must have sold at least 13 - 54 = 41 egg tarts.
Response:  The baker made 145 + 72 = 217 pieces of cake in total.
"Response:  The baker has 155 eggs left after his friend bought 140 egg cakes from him. To find out how many egg cakes the baker has left, we can subtract the number of egg cakes sold (140) from the total number of egg cakes available (155):  
155 - 140 = 15  
Therefore, the baker has 15 egg cakes left."
Response:  The baker has 121 - 105 + 170 = 286 eggs left.
"Response:  The baker bought more than 91 additional cakes, since he bought 154 new cakes and sold 91 old ones. So, the difference is:  
154 - 91 = 63 
Therefore, the baker bought 63 more cakes than he sold."
"Response:  The number of cakes sold by the baker is 78. To find out how many more new cakes he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes he had:  

Total number of cakes = 170  
Number of cakes sold = 78  
Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:  

170 - 78 = 92  
So, the baker bought 92 more new cakes than he sold."
Response:  The baker has 35 leftover cakes (110 - 75 = 35).
"Response:  The baker made 111 more pastries than he sold.  
Explanation:  To find out how many more pastries the baker made than he sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold (71) from the total number of pastries he made (144). This gives us:  
144 - 71 = 73  
So, the baker made 73 more pastries than he sold."
Response:  The baker has 149 - 10 = 139 egg tarts left.
Response:  The baker has 148 - 15 = 133 cakes left after selling 15 cakes and 103 - 15 = 88 pastries left after selling 15 pastries.
Response:  The baker made 126 - 81 = 45 more egg tarts than cakes.
Response:  If the baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries, and sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, then he sold 70/19 = 365% more cakes than he made, and 88/131 = 67% more pastries than he made.
"Response:  The number of cakes sold is 158, and the number of pastries sold is 147. To find out how many more cakes were sold than pastries, we can subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes:  
158 - 147 = 11. So, 11 more cakes were sold than pastries."
Response:  If the baker sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries, then he sold (68 + 92) = 160 items in total. Since he made 54 cakes and 143 pastries, he had (54 + 143) = 207 items to begin with. Therefore, the number of pastries he sold is 160 - 207 = -47.
Response:  The baker has 48 - 44 = 4 remaining egg tarts.
Response:  If the baker initially made 40 egg tarts and sold 8 of them, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 remaining egg tarts.
Response:  If Becker's friend bought 137 eggs from him and he initially made 169 eggs, then Becker has 32 eggs left (169 - 137 = 32).
Response:  The baker has 173 - 86 = 87 eggs left.
Response:  The baker bought more than he sold by (167 - 89) = 78 new cakes.
Response:  The baker sold 145 - 139 = 6 more egg tarts than he bought.
Response:  The baker has 8 remaining cakes (149 - 144 = 8).
Response:  The baker made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes in total. He sold 46 of them, so he has 173 - 46 = 127 cakes left.
Response:  The baker has 167 - 44 = 123 eggs left after selling 108 egg tarts and 44 cakes.
"Response:  The baker has 37 cakes and 29 pastries left.  
Explanation:  To find out how many pastries the baker has left, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold (29) from the total number of pastries he made (56). This gives us:  
56 - 29 = 27  
So, the baker has 27 pastries left.  
To find out how many cakes the baker has left, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold (104) from the total number of cakes he made (56):  
56 - 104 = -48  
Since the baker cannot have negative amount of cakes, we know that he does not have any cakes left. Therefore, the final answer is:  
The baker has 27 pastries left."
Response:  If the baker made 52 cakes and 84 pastries, then he sold 102 cakes (102 - 52 = 50) and 94 pastries (94 - 84 = 10). So, he sold 50 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  The baker made 134 cakes and 11 pastries, so he had 134 + 11 = 145 items in total. If he sold 140 eggs and 92 cakes, then he sold 140 - 134 = 6 eggs and 92 - 134 = 41 cakes. Therefore, he sold 6 / 134 = 4% more cakes than eggs.
Response:  If the baker sold 8 point-sized pastries and 97 cakes, then he sold 8 + 97 = 105 more items than points.
Response:  The number of cakes sold is 154 + 78 = 232.  Therefore, the number of cakes sold is more than the number of egg tarts by 232 - 114 = 118.
Response:  To find out how many more games Katelyn needs to buy, we need to subtract the number of games she already has (22) from the total number of games she wants to have (140). So, we can use subtraction:  140 - 22 = 118. Therefore, Katelyn needs to buy 118 more games.
Response:  If Kaitlyn has 106 video games and sends out 64 of them, she will have 42 video games left (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Katelyn sent out 91 games and now has 92 games left, then she had 93 games initially (92 + 91 = 93).
Response:  To find out how many Nintendo games Katelyn needs to send away so that she has 12 Sony games left, we need to subtract the number of Nintendo games from her total number of games. Let's do this: Total number of games = 20 (Nintendo) + 70 (Sony) = 90 games. Number of Sony games = 70. Number of Nintendo games = 20. To have 12 Sony games left, Katelyn needs to send away: 12 - 70 = 58 Nintendo games.
"Response:  To find out how many Sony games Katelyn needs to send away so that she has 31 games left, we need to subtract 31 from her total number of Sony games.  So, if Katelyn has 132 Sony games, she would need to send away:  
132 - 31 = 101 games."
Response:  Kaley needs to send away 49 games (31 - 6 = 49)
Response:  Lanning has 52 blocks of wood and builds a tower with them. If he has 38 blocks left over, then he had 52 - 38 = 14 blocks to start with.
Response:  If 兰迪 has 97 pieces of wood and builds a tower using some of them, then he must have used at least 72 pieces of wood to build the tower (since there are only 72 pieces left after building the tower). Therefore, the answer is 72.
Response:  There are 79 blocks in total, and Lily used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. Therefore, there are 79 - (14 + 11) = 79 - 25 = 54 blocks left over.
Response:  To find out how many wooden planks Lanning used to build the tower and the house, we need to subtract the number of planks used for the tower from the total number of planks he had. Let's do that: Total number of planks = 58 Planks used for the tower = 27 So, the number of planks left for the house is: 58 - 27 = 31 Planks used for the house = 31 Therefore, Lanning used 31 planks to build the house.
"Response:  The number of wooden planks used to build the tower is 33, and the number of wooden planks used to build the house is 13. To find out how many more wooden planks were used for the tower than for the house, we can subtract the number of wooden planks used for the house from the number of wooden planks used for the tower:  

33 - 13 = 20 

So, 20 more wooden planks were used for the tower than for the house."
Response:  The number of wooden planks used to build the house is 82 - 79 = 3 more than the number of wooden planks used to build the tower.
Response:  If Ran Di has 59 wooden sticks and he used 36 of them to build a tower, then he has 23 wooden sticks left (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  The number of wooden planks used to build the tower is 3 times the number of wooden planks used to build the house. So, if 20 wooden planks were used to build the house, then 3 x 20 = 60 wooden planks were used to build the tower.
"Response:  The number of wooden planks used to build the house is 89, and the number of wooden planks used to build the tower is 63. To find out how many more wooden planks were used for the house than for the tower, we can subtract the number of wooden planks used for the tower from the number of wooden planks used for the house:  

89 - 63 =?

Question:  If Haley wants to plant new trees in her backyard to replace the ones that died during the hurricane, how many new trees should she plant to have as many alive trees as she had before the storm? 
Answer:  She needs to plant 9 more trees to have as many alive trees as she had before the storm."
Response:  There are 7 alive trees left after the storm (13 - 6 = 7).
Response: 16 (20 - 4 = 16) trees died in the hurricane.
Response:  If Haley has 12 trees left after the hurricane and 5 trees died, then she had 12 - 5 = 7 trees before the hurricane.
Response:  After the hurricane, Haley had 9 trees in her backyard, and 4 of them died. So she has 9 - 4 = 5 trees left.
Response:  If Heidi initially planted 12 trees in her backyard and two of them died after a typhoon, then she still has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left in her backyard.

Response:  He discovered that they harvested 66 baskets per day, and each basket contained 28 oranges, so they harvested 66 x 28 = 1848 oranges per day.
"Response: 3 days.

Question:  如果他每天采摘2袋橙子，那么在哪一天会完成采摘24袋橙子的任务？ 
Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 12 days."
Response:  He will receive 14 bags of oranges per day (56/4 = 14).
"Response:  The number of bags of oranges harvested in 49 days is equal to the number of days multiplied by the number of bags per day, which is:

49 days x 38 bags/day = 1762 bags

So, after 49 days, they will have harvested 1762 bags of oranges."
Response:  To find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges they will harvest in 87 days. We know that they harvest 66 baskets per day, and each basket contains 25 oranges. So, to calculate the total number of oranges, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of oranges in each basket: Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket Total number of oranges = 66 x 25 Total number of oranges = 1,650 Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have 1,650 oranges.
Response:  The farmer receives 8 baskets of oranges per day, and each basket contains 35 oranges, so he receives 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  To collect 80 bags of oranges, it would take 80/16 = 5 days.
Response:  To find out how many oranges were picked in total, we need to multiply the number of baskets by the number of oranges in each basket. In this case, if they picked 35 baskets and each basket has 12 oranges, then they picked a total of 35 x 12 = 420 oranges.
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they have 3 remaining bags of oranges (71 x 51 = 3611 - 3 = 3).
Response:  He collects data that they harvest 76 bags of oranges per day, with 64 bags being discarded. If each bag contains 50 oranges, then they harvest 76 x 50 = 3800 oranges per day.
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 26 x 28 = 720 bags of mature oranges and 26 x 52 = 1320 bags of immature oranges, for a total of 2040 bags of oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 bags of mature oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 bags of immature oranges.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, they will have 24 x 45 = 1080 unripe oranges.
"Response:  The number of bags of mature oranges collected per day is 44, and the number of bags of immature oranges collected per day is 25. To find out how many more bags of mature oranges are collected than immature oranges, we can subtract the number of bags of immature oranges from the number of bags of mature oranges:

44 - 25 = 19

So, 19 more bags of mature oranges are collected per day than immature oranges."
Response:  The number of bags of unripe oranges collected daily is 3 times the number of bags of ripe oranges collected daily. Therefore, the number of bags of unripe oranges collected daily is 3 x 5 = 15 bags.
Response:  To find out how many days it would take to harvest all 54 bags of oranges if they harvest 18 bags per day, we can divide the total number of bags by the daily harvest:  54 bags / 18 bags/day = 3 days
Response:  If they harvested 56 bags of oranges in 14 days, then they harvested approximately 4 bags of oranges per day (56 / 14 = 4).
Response:  After 73 days of continuous harvesting, there will be 73 x 5 = 365 baskets of ripe oranges (since each day they collect 5 baskets of ripe oranges).
Response:  On the sixth day, there will be 65 x 6 = 390 unripe oranges and 46 x 6 = 276 ripe oranges in total.
Response:  The number of bags of mature oranges collected per day is 86 - 41 = 45 bags more than the number of bags of unripe oranges collected per day.
Response:  The number of bags of unripe oranges collected daily is 71 - 60 = 11 more than the number of bags of ripe oranges collected daily.
"Response:  Jessie's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we can subtract the width from the length:  

12 - 11 = 1 foot  
So, Jessie's room is one foot longer than it is wide."
"Response:  To find out how wide Jessie's room needs to be in order to have enough space for a rug that is 14 square feet in size, we need to divide 14 by 7 (the length of her room). This gives us: 

14 / 7 = 2 So, Jessie's room needs to be at least 2 times as wide as it is long (i.e., 2 x 7 = 14). Therefore, the width of Jessie's room must be at least 14 feet wide."
Response:  To find out how long Jessie's room needs to be in order to have enough space for a rug that is 14 square feet in size, we need to divide 14 by 7 (the width of her room). This gives us:  14 / 7 = 2 So, Jessie's room needs to be at least 2 times as long as it is wide, or 2 x 7 = 14 feet long.
Response:  To find out how much more carpet Jessie needs to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of her room that is not covered by the existing carpet. Let's first find the area of the room that is already covered by the carpet: Area = Length x Width = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet Since Jessie has 16 square feet of carpet, she still needs to buy enough carpet to cover the remaining area of the room: Amount needed = Total area - Area with carpet = 179 - 165 = 14 square feet Therefore, Jessie needs 14 square feet of additional carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor, we need to first calculate the total area of the room's floor. Since the room is rectangular in shape, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length of the room is 2 feet (2 ft) and the width is 12 feet (12 ft), so the area of the room is: Area = 2 ft x 12 ft = 24 square feet. Next, we know that each tile has an area of 4 square feet, so we can divide the total area of the room by the size of each tile to determine how many tiles are needed: Number of tiles = Total area / Size of each tile Number of tiles = 24 sq ft / 4 sq ft per tile Number of tiles = 6 tiles To cover the entire floor of the room, Jessie will need 6 tiles.
"Response:  To find out how many square feet of carpet Jessie needs to cover all her rooms, we need to multiply the length and width of each room. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we can calculate the total area as follows:  
Total Area = (Length x Width) x Number of Rooms  Total Area = (19 x 18) x 20  Total Area = 3520 sq ft  Therefore, Jessie needs 3520 square feet of carpet to cover all her rooms' floors."
"Response:  The room is longer than it is wide. To find out how much longer, we can subtract the width from the length:  
Length - Width = 20 - 19 = 1 ft.  So, the room is 1 foot longer than it is wide."
"Response:  To find out how wide Jessie's room is, we need to divide the area of the rug by the length of the room. Since the area of the rug is 10 square feet and the length of the room is 5 feet, we can calculate the width of the room as follows:  
Width = Area / Length Width = 10 sq ft / 5 ft Width = 2 ft (or 24 inches) Therefore, Jessie's room is 2 feet wide."
Response:  To find out how long Jessie's room needs to be in order to cover it with a rug that is 10 square feet in size, we need to first determine the area of her room. Since the width of her room is given as 2 feet, we can use this information to calculate the length of her room. Area = Width x Length, so we can set up an equation: Area = 2 x Length. We know that the area of the rug is 10 square feet, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 10 = 2 x Length. Now, we can solve for Length by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: Length = 10 / 2. Simplifying, we get: Length = 5 feet. Therefore, Jessie's room needs to be at least 5 feet long in order to cover it with a rug that is 10 square feet in size.
Response:  To find out how much more carpet Jessie needs to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of her room first. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where L is the length and W is the width. In this case, the length (L) is 4 feet and the width (W) is 20 feet. So, the area of the room is: Area = L x W = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet Now, we know that Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet. So, she needs an additional 80 - 18 = 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  Let x be the number of T-shirts sold.  Since each T-shirt costs $23 and they sold $230 worth of T-shirts, we can write:  23x = 230  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 23:  x = 230 / 23  x = 10 Therefore, they sold 10 T-shirts.
Response:  To find out how much each T-shirt costs, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold: $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt.
"Response:  If they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas State competition and each T-shirt was sold for $87, then they would have earned:

47 x $87 = $3,969

So, they would have earned $3,969 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas State competition."
Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold during the Texas A&M University competition, we can set up an equation based on the information given: Let X be the number of T-shirts sold at Texas A&M University. Since 115 T-shirts were sold in Arkansas, and the total number of T-shirts sold is 242, we can write: X + 115 = 242... 242 - 115 = X + 115 - 115 We simplify: 227 = X + 115 Simplifying further: X = 112 Therefore, there were 112 T-shirts sold during the Texas A&M University competition.
Response:  The T-shirt store sold $89 \times 98 = 8,722 dollars worth of T-shirts during the Arkansas state competition.
"Response:  To find out how much money was made selling t-shirts at Texas A&M University, we need to know how many t-shirts were sold during each competition and what price they were sold for. Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation: 
Let x be the number of t-shirts sold at Arkansas State Competition. Since 172 t-shirts were sold during this competition, we can write: 
x + 172 = 186 (total number of t-shirts sold) 
Since each t-shirt cost $78, the total revenue from sales at the Arkansas State Competition is: 
Revenue at Arkansas State Competition = x x $78 = 78x 
Now, let y be the number of t-shirts sold at Texas A&M University. We know that 186 - x t-shirts were sold at Texas A&M University, so we can write: 
y + (186 - x) = 186 (total number of t-shirts sold) 
Substituting the value of x from the first equation, we get: 
y + 172 - x = 186 
Solving for y, we get: 
y = 114 (number of t-shirts sold at Texas A&M University) 
Now, we can calculate the revenue from sales at Texas A&M University as follows: 
Revenue at Texas A&M University = y x $78 = 8592 (since there were 114 t-shirts sold) 
Therefore, the total revenue from both competitions is: 
Total Revenue = 78x + 8592 = 78x + 8592 (since there were 114 t-shirts sold at Texas A&M University) 
To find out how much money was made selling t-shirts at Texas A&M University, we need to solve for x. We do this by setting up an equation using the information given in the problem: 
We are told that the profit from selling"
"Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts, we need to multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per unit. In this case, if they sold 183 T-shirts at $62 each, then:  

183 x $62 = $11,466 

So, they made $11,466 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts and jerseys combined, we need to calculate the total revenue first. For T-shirts, each one costs $67, so the total revenue from selling 74 T-shirts is:  

74 x $67 = $5,028 

For jerseys, each one costs $165, so the total revenue from selling 156 jerseys is:  

156 x $165 = $25,390 

Now, let's add up the total revenue from both T-shirts and jerseys:  

$5,028 + $25,390 = $30,418 

So, they made $30,418 in total from selling T-shirts and jerseys at the two games."
"Response:  To find out how much more one T-shirt costs than one baseball jersey, we need to divide the price difference by the number of items sold. Let's do that:

Price difference = $192 (T-shirt) - $34 (baseball jersey) = $158

Number of T-shirts sold = 157

Number of baseball jerseys sold = 19

Now, let's calculate the average cost per item for each type of clothing:

Average cost per T-shirt = $158 / 157 = $1.006

Average cost per baseball jersey = $34 / 19 = $1.79

So, one T-shirt costs $1.006 more than one baseball jersey."
Response:  To find out how much more expensive one item of clothing is compared to another, we need to subtract the price of one from the other.  Let's use T-shirts as the reference point and compare them to baseball jerseys.   Price of T-shirt = $86 per unit Price of baseball jersey = $232 per unit Subtracting the prices gives us: $232 - $86 = $146 So, one baseball jersey costs $146 more than one T-shirt.
Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the competition period, we need to calculate the total revenue first. Total revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt Before discount = 130 x 51 = $6,430 During the competition period, each T-shirt was sold at a discounted price of $8 less than the original price, so the new price per T-shirt = $51 - $8 = $43 Revenue after discount = Number of T-shirts x New price per T-shirt = 130 x $43 = $5,490 Therefore, they made $6,430 - $5,490 = $940 in profit from selling T-shirts during the competition period.
Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by selling 14 T-shirts at $217 each. Total Revenue = Number of items x Price per item Total Revenue = 14 x $217 Total Revenue = $3,158 Therefore, they made $3,158 from selling T-shirts during the competition period.
"Response:  To find out how many T-shirts were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the number of T-shirts sold. We know that each T-shirt costs $10 and they made $60 in total. So, the equation would be:  

x \* 10 = 60 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 60 / 10 

x = 6 

So, they sold 6 T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much each T-shirt costs, we need to divide the total amount earned by the number of T-shirts sold:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \frac{\$215}{\text{number of T-shirts}} $$
Since we know that 5 T-shirts were sold, we can substitute this value into the equation above:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \frac{\$215}{5} $$
Simplifying and solving for the cost per T-shirt, we get:  

$$ \text{Cost per T-shirt} = \$43 $$
So, each T-shirt costs $43."
"Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts, we need to multiply the number of T-shirts sold by the price per unit. In this case, if they sold 20 T-shirts at $215 each, then they made:  

20 x $215 = $4,300 

So, they made $4,300 from selling T-shirts."
"Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts and jerseys, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from each item sold. For T-shirts, the price is $204 per unit, so if they sold 158 units, the total amount earned from T-shirts is:  

158 x $204 = $31,992 

For jerseys, the price is $76 per unit, so if they sold 2 units, the total amount earned from jerseys is:  

2 x $76 = $152 

Therefore, the total amount earned by Razorbacks from both T-shirts and jerseys is:  

$31,992 + $152 = $32,144"
"Response:  To find out how much more one T-shirt costs than one jersey, we need to divide the difference between the prices of the two items by the price of the item that is cheaper. In this case, the difference between the prices of the two items is:  

$240 (price of a jersey) - $210 (price of a T-shirt) = $30

So, one T-shirt costs $30 more than one jersey."
Response:  To find out how much more expensive the ball gowns are than the T-shirts, we need to subtract the price of the T-shirts from the price of the ball gowns.   Price of ball gowns - Price of T-shirts = $115 (ball gowns) - $25 (T-shirts) = $90  So, the ball gowns are $90 more expensive than the T-shirts.
Response:  They have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs. Therefore, they have a total of 5 x 10 = 50 chairs.
Response:  There are 12 chairs in total in the backyard, and each table has the same number of chairs. Let x be the number of chairs on each table. Since there are two tables, we have 2x chairs in total. We know that the total number of chairs is 12, so we can set up the equation:  2x = 12. Solving for x, we get:  x = 6. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  They have 3 tables with 3 chairs each, so they have 3 x 3 = 9 chairs in total.
Response:  The backyard has 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, so the total number of chairs in the backyard is 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.
"Response:  There will be 4 extra chairs unused if 11 people sit on the chairs.  
Explanation: Since there are 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each, the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. If 11 people sit on these chairs, one person will have to sit on an additional chair, which means that there will be 60 - 1 = 59 chairs used and only 4 chairs (1 set of 6 chairs) left unused."
Response:  They need to prepare 18 chairs (12 sets of 14 chairs + 6 extra chairs) for their guests.
"Response:  To determine how many chairs are needed for the party, we need to know how many people will be attending and how many chairs each table can seat. Let's assume that each table has 3 chairs per set. We also know that there are 4 tables in total. Therefore, if 14 people attend the party, we can calculate the number of chairs needed as follows:  
14 (people) x 3 (chairs/table) = 42 chairs  Since each table has 3 chairs, we need 42 / 3 = 14 chairs for all 4 tables."
Response:  They will have 9 x 14 = 126 chairs in total.
Response:  If Luke earned $460 in five weeks, he earned an average of $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks = $92 per week).
Response:  The receipt season lasted for 78 weeks, since 1216 / 16 = 78.
"Response:  If 刘易斯 (Liu) earns $21 per week for 216 weeks and pays $702 in taxes at the end of the season, he will have $X left after paying the taxes. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let X be the amount Liu has left after paying taxes.

Formula: X = 21(216) - 702

Simplify the formula: X = 4592 - 702

Solve for X: X = 3890

Therefore, Liu will have $3890 left after paying taxes."
"Response:  If Luke earns $1357 per week during each of the 223 weeks of the harvest season and works for 73 seasons, he will earn a total of:

$1357 x 223 = $309,411"
Response:  If Louis works overtime every week during the harvest season (10 weeks), he can earn an additional $939 x 10 = $9,390. Therefore, his total income for the harvest season would be $28 x 10 + $9,390 = $28,390.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, Louis earned $403 per week during the harvest season, and he paid $49 per week in rent. To find out how much he earned during the entire season, we can multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the season:  
$403 x 23 = $8,761  
Therefore, Louis earned $8,761 during the harvest season after paying $49 per week in rent."
Response:  To find out how much rent Louis paid during the harvest season, we need to calculate the number of weeks he worked during that period. Since he works for 368 dollars per week and has a total of 1359 weeks (or 27 months), we can calculate his total earnings as follows: Total Earnings = Number of Weeks x Weekly Wage Total Earnings = 1359 x 368 = 490,124 dollars Now, let's subtract his weekly rent from his total earnings to find out how much rent he paid during the harvest season: Rent Paid = Total Earnings - Weekly Rent Rent Paid = 490,124 - 388 = 141,746 dollars Therefore, Louis paid $141,746 in rent during the harvest season.
"Response:  After 1181 weeks (which is equivalent to approximately 23 years), Louis will have earned $491 per week for a total of:

$491 x 1181 = $567,011

So, after 23 years, Louis will have $567,011."
Response:  To find out how much Louis earned per week, we need to divide his total earnings by the number of weeks he worked. So, we can calculate:  133 dollars / 19 weeks = 6.95 dollars per week
Response:  The number of weeks that Louis received $2 per week is:  178 / 2 = 89 weeks

"Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to distribute them equally between two bookshelves, then each bookshelf will have:  
34 books / 2 bookshelves = 17 books per bookshelf."
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each bookshelf can hold 2 books, then he needs 42/2 = 21 bookshelves.
"Response:  If each bookshelf has 27 books and there are 23 bookshelves, then the total number of books is:  
27 x 23 = 611 books"
Response:  If each bookshelf has 9 books and there are 10 bookshelves, then the total number of books is 9 x 10 = 90 books.  If each bookshelf also has 46 magazines, then the total number of magazines is 46 x 10 = 460 magazines.  Therefore, Blair has a total of 90 books + 460 magazines = 550 publications.
Response:  If each bookshelf has 23 books and 61 magazines, then the total number of books is 23 x 29 = 677 books. The total number of magazines is 61 x 29 = 1891 magazines.
Response:  There are 7 bookshelves and each bookshelf has x books. Since there are 28 books in total, we can set up the equation:  7x = 28. Solving for x, we get:  x = 4. So, each bookshelf has 4 books.
Response:  If each bookshelf has 2 books and Blair has 38 books in total, then he needs 38/2 = 19 bookshelves.
Response:  To ensure that no friend is left out, Carole needs to purchase at least packages of invitation cards, since each package contains two invitations and she has friends to invite.
Response:  Each package contains the same number of invitation cards, and there are 3 packages in total. Therefore, the total number of invitation cards is 3 x (same number) = 3x.
Response:  If Carole buys 7 packages of invitation cards and each package contains 10 cards, then she has a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitation cards. If she sends only 2 invitations to her friends, then she will have 70 - 2 = 68 remaining invitation cards.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Carole can invite 25 friends in total (14 x 6 = 84 + 11 = 25).
Response:  To invite 9 friends, Carole needs to buy extra  6 cards (9 - 3 = 6).
Response:  If 梅丽莎 got 36 points in total and each game she played earned her 12 points, then she played 36/12 = 3 games.
Response:  Based on the information provided, we know that 梅丽莎 (Mary) played three games and scored a total of 81 points. Since each game had the same score, we can assume that she scored 81 points in each game. Therefore, Mary scored 81 points in each of the three games.
"Response:  To find out how many points Meryl scored in all 79 games, we need to multiply her average score per game by the number of games she played.  Therefore, the total number of points Meryl scored is:  

(109 x 82) x 79 = 634580 "
Response:  If 梅丽莎 gets 7 points per game and she has a total of 21 points, then she played 3 games (21 / 7 = 3).
Response:  Each match scored by Meryl earned her 7 points (91/13).
"Response:  The Ferris wheel has four seats, and each seat can accommodate multiple people. Since there are 20 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, we need to find out how many people each seat can accommodate so that all 20 people can fit in the Ferris wheel. Let's assume that each seat can accommodate x people. Then, we have:

x + x + x + x = 20... (1)

Since each seat can accommodate the same number of people, we can simplify equation (1):

4x = 20... (2)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5... (3)

Therefore, each seat can accommodate five people, and the Ferris wheel can accommodate a total of 20 people (5 x 4 = 20)."
Response:  The Ferris wheel has 9 seats per ride and can accommodate 18 people at once. Therefore, the number of seat positions is 9 x 18 = 162.
"Response:  To find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheels in total, we need to multiply the number of seats per Ferris wheel by the number of Ferris wheels. In this case, there are 19 seats per Ferris wheel and 20 Ferris wheels, so:  

19 x 20 = 380 
Therefore, up to 380 people can ride the Ferris wheels at once."
"Response:  The number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is calculated as follows:  
Number of working seats = 18 (since there are 18 seats in total) x Number of people per seat = 15 (since each seat can accommodate 15 people) = 270 (18 x 15 = 270)  Since 10 seats are broken, the number of available seats is reduced by 10: Available seats = 270 - 10 = 260 (270 - 10 = 260) Therefore, up to 260 people can ride the Ferris wheel simultaneously if 10 out of 18 seats are broken."
Response:  The capacity of each seat in the Ferris wheel is 14 people, and there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel. To determine how many more people can join, we need to subtract the current number of people from the capacity of each seat:  14 - 16 = -2. Therefore, no more than 2 people can join the Ferris wheel.
"Response:  The total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel is calculated as follows:

Small seats: 2 x 14 = 28 people per small seat
Large seats: 23 x 54 = 1232 people per large seat
Total: 28 + 1232 = 1260 people
Therefore, the Ferris wheel can accommodate 1260 people in total."
Response:  The amusement park's Ferris wheel has 3 small seats that can accommodate 16 people each and 7 large seats that can accommodate 12 people each. Therefore, the total number of people who can sit in the large seats is 7 x 12 = 84 people. So, the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 3 x 16 + 84 = 504 people.
Response:  If the Ferris wheel has 4 seats and can accommodate 16 people at once, then each seat can hold:  16 / 4 = 4 people
Response:  The Ferris wheel has 4 seats per car, and each seat can accommodate 2 people, so the total number of seats is 4 x 2 = 8.
"Response:  Each biscuit has the same number of thin slices, so we can divide the total number of thin slices by the number of biscuits to find out how many thin slices each biscuit has. Let's do that:

Total number of thin slices = 14 pieces
Number of biscuits = 7

Now, let's divide the total number of thin slices by the number of biscuits:

14 / 7 = 2

So, each biscuit has 2 thin slices."
Response:  We ordered 14 sets of dumplings, since each set has 2 pieces and we ordered a total of 28 pieces.
Response:  If we have ordered 17 pieces of biscuits and each piece has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people, each person will get approximately 25/68 = 0.39 (or 39%) of the total slices.
Response:  If we have 9 boxes of biscuits with 10 pieces each and there are 2 people, if we distribute them equally among the two people, then each person can get 9 x 10 = 90 pieces of biscuits.

Response:  There are 36 / 12 = 3 flower beds, and each flower bed has 58 flowers. So there are 3 x 58 = 174 flowers in total.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of flower pots as x. Since each pot contains 15 seeds and only 60% of them grow into flowers, the number of flowers grown in each pot is:  
x \* 0.6 = 60 
Now, we know that 55 seeds were planted in total, so the total number of flower pots is:  
x = 55 / 60 = 9 
Therefore, they grew 9 flower pots."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, if they have planted 60 seeds in total and each flower bed can hold 10 seeds, then they have planted 6 flower beds.

"Response:  If Mao gives each of his 11 friends 2 pieces of cake, how many pieces of cake will he have left? 

Answer:  Mao has 10 pieces of cake left."
Response:  If Mao gives each friend two biscuits, he will give 8/2 = 4 friends biscuits.
Response:  If Mao has 15 biscuits and gives each of his 5 friends an equal number of biscuits, then he will have 10 biscuits left. Therefore, each friend will get 3 biscuits (15 / 5 = 3).
Response:  If Mao gives his three friends an equal number of biscuits, he will have 17 biscuits left. So each friend gets 5 biscuits (17 / 3 = 5).
Response:  If Mao has 22 cookies and wants to divide them equally among his 11 friends, each friend will get 22/11 = 2 cookies.
Response:  If Mao gives each of his two friends an equal number of cookies and cakes, then he will have 29 cookies and 30 cakes left after giving them away. Therefore, each friend will receive 14.5 cookies (29 / 2) and 15 cakes (30 / 2).
Response:  If Mao gives each of his 7 friends an equal number of cookies and cakes, then each friend will receive 14/7 = 2 cookies and 21/7 = 3 cakes.
Response:  Each person will eat 2 pieces of crackers (36 / 18 = 2).
Response:  If 马修 has 36 pieces of biscuit and gives each of his friends 6 pieces, then he can give biscuits to 36/6 = 6 friends.
Response:  Each of the two friends ate 7 pieces of crackers (23 - 11 = 12 / 2 = 7).
Response:  If Ma Xu has 31 pieces of crackers and gives the same number of crackers to his 5 friends, then he will have 31 - 5 = 26 pieces of crackers left.
Response:  If each of the four friends eats an equal amount of cookies and cake, then they will eat a total of 32/4 = 8 cookies and 98/4 = 24 slices of cake.
"Response:  If Mao gives each of his four friends an equal number of cookies and cakes, then he will have to divide 10 cookies and 8 cakes among them. Since there are 4 friends, each friend will get:  
Cookies: 10 / 4 = 2.5 cookies per person Cakes: 8 / 4 = 2 cakes per person"
Response:  If each of the 28 friends received an equal number of cookies and cakes, then they would have received 28/2 = 14 pieces in total (since there are 2 types of food). Since there were initially 13 cookies and 15 cakes, each friend would have received 13/28 cookies and 15/28 cakes. Therefore, each friend would have eaten 13/28 x 2 = 2 cookies and 15/28 x 2 = 3 cakes.
"Response:  If 黛比 drinks 109 bottles per day and there are 74 days in total, then she will drink a total of:

109 x 74 = 8236 bottles

So, she will need to buy 8236 bottles in total."
Response:  If 黛比 (Didi) buys 153 water bottles and drinks the same amount every day for 17 days, then she will drink 153 x 17 = 2601 water bottles in total.
Response:  If 黛比 (Didi) drinks 15 water bottles per day and she has been drinking for 11 days, then she has consumed = 15 x 11 = 165 water bottles.  Since she bought 264 water bottles, she still has = 264 - 165 = 99 water bottles left.
Response:  If 黛比 drinks 144 bottles per day and has 157 bottles left, she has enough water for days.
"Response:  If 黛比 drinks 4 water bottles and 87 suda bottles every day, then she consumes a total of 4 + 87 = 91 bottles per day. Since she has bought 88 water bottles and 13 suda bottles in total, the number of days she can continue drinking at this rate is:  

88 / 91 = 2 days (water bottles)  
13 / 91 = 0 days (su da bottles)

Therefore, 黛比 can continue drinking for 2 days with the water bottles she has purchased, but she will run out of su da bottles after 0 days."
"Response:  If 黛比 drinks 312 water bottles and 4 suda bottles every day, then she needs a total of 312 + 4 = 316 units of water per day. Since she has bought 200 water bottles and 256 suda bottles in total, we can calculate how many days these supplies will last as follows:  

Days of water supply = Total number of water bottles / Daily consumption of water bottles = 200 / 312 = 0.64 days (or 1.5 days)  

Days of suda supply = Total number of suda bottles / Daily consumption of suda bottles = 256 / 4 = 64 days (or 1 month and 1.5 days) Therefore, 黛比's water supply will last for approximately 1.5 days, while her suda supply will last for approximately 1 month and 1.5 days."
Response:  If 黛比 drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she bought 12 bottles in total, then she can use this water for 2 days (12 / 6 = 2).
"Response:  If 黛比 drinks 15 bottles of mineral water and 54 bottles of purified water every day, then she can sustain her consumption for:  

Day = (Total amount of mineral water) / (Daily consumption of mineral water) = (95 bottles) / (15 bottles/day) = 6 days

Therefore, 黛比 can sustain her consumption of mineral water for 6 days."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, if 黛比 drinks 122 bottles of mineral water and 9 bottles of purified water per day, then she can sustain her consumption of purified water for 

18 days (122 x 7 = 854 - 9 = 18)."
Response:  The girl has 14 x 11 = 154 supports of lead pencils.

Response:  If there are 98 students and 7 school buses, each school bus can seat approximately 14 students (98 / 7 = 14).
"Response:  The school has 84 classrooms and 95 buses, with each bus having 118 seats, so the total number of students is:  
84 x 118 = 9,732 students."
"Response:  To calculate how many school buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. We can start by dividing 67 (the number of classrooms) by 6 (the number of seats per bus): 

67 / 6 =? 

Answer: 11 

So, we need 11 school buses for the field trip."
Response:  To calculate how many school buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats in each bus. Since there are 58 students and each bus has two seats, we can calculate the number of buses as follows:  58 students / 2 seats per bus = 29 buses  Therefore, 29 school buses would be needed for the field trip.
"Response:  There are 24 classrooms and each has the same number of students (let's call it x). Since there are 120 students in total, we can set up an equation based on that:

x \* 24 = 120

Solving for x, we get:

x = 5

So, each classroom has 5 students. Now, let's find out how many students will be in each school bus. We know that each bus has 84 seats, so if we divide 84 by 5 (the number of students per classroom), we get:

84 / 5 = 16

Therefore, each school bus can accommodate 16 students."
"Response:  To determine how many school buses are needed for the field trip, we need to calculate the number of students who will be attending the trip and divide that by the number of seats available per bus. We know that there are 102 students in total, and each bus has 8 seats, so we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:  
102 students / 8 seats per bus = 13 buses  Therefore, 13 school buses would be needed for the field trip if all 102 students participate. However, the question states that 22 students do not want to attend the trip, so we need to subtract those students from the total number of students.  
102 students - 22 students = 80 students  Now we can recalculate the number of buses needed based on the new total number of students:  
80 students / 8 seats per bus = 10 buses  So, 10 school buses would be needed for the field trip if 22 students do not attend."
Response:  There will be 11 x 99 = 1099 students participating in the field trip if all 11 students attend. If 8 students do not attend, there will be 11 - 8 = 3 students who participate in the field trip.
Response:  To determine how many school buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. We can do this as follows:  111 students / 3 seats per bus = 37 buses  Therefore, 37 school buses will be needed for the field trip.
Response:  If each school bus can seat 8 students and there are 46 school buses, then the total number of seats available is 46 x 8 = 368 seats. Since there are 92 students, we know that not all students will be able to fit in one bus, so let's divide the total number of seats by the number of students to find out how many seats each student will have: 368 / 92 = 4 seats per student.
Response:  Haley has 11 boys who like to play marbles, and she gives each boy 9 marbles. Therefore, she has 11 x 9 = 99 marbles in total.
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and gives each boy 5 marbles, then she gave a total of 10 x 5 = 50 marbles to all the boys.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to leave 15 for herself, then each boy will receive (23 - 15) = 8 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing marbles and each boy will get 26 marbles, then each boy will receive 26 x 13 = 348 marbles in total.
"Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and there are 2 boys in her class who like to play with marbles, then each boy will receive 10 marbles if they are divided equally among them.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Based on the information given, the ball costs $0.10."
Response:  Haley gave each boy 2 balls, so she gave 2 x 10 = 20 boys balls. She had 28 balls in total, so there were 28 / 20 = 4 groups of boys playing with her.
"Response:  To find out how many days Frank will take to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 

Days = Total Pages / Daily Pages 
Days = 392 / 14 
Days = 28 Days Therefore, it will take Frank 28 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  The book has 22 pages per day x 365 days = 7990 pages.
Response:  To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading the book. Let's do that: Total pages = 612 pages Number of days = 6 days To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading the book: Daily pages = Total pages / Number of days Daily pages = 612 pages / 6 days Daily pages = 102 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day.
Response:  The number of pages in each chapter can be calculated as follows: Total pages = 555 Number of chapters = 5 Total pages per chapter = Total pages / Number of chapters Chapter pages = 555 / 5 Chapter pages = 111 pages Each chapter has 111 pages.
Response:  To find out how many chapters Frank read each day, we need to divide the number of days he took to finish the book (660) by the number of chapters in the book (15). So, Frank read approximately 44 chapters per day (660 / 15 = 44).
Response:  To find out how many pages Frank read each day, we need to divide the total number of pages in each book by the number of days he spent reading it. Let's use the information given in the problem: There are 249 pages in each book, and Frank spent 3 days reading each book.

Response:  On the previous day, there were 132 - 406 = 274 visitors to the Buckingham Palace.
Response:  There were 45 + 829 = 874 visitors to the Palace of Whitehall in that day.
"Response:  To find out how many people visited the Palace of Whitehall within 57 days, we need to add up the number of visitors from each day. Let's start by listing the information given in the problem:

Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2 (after eating a sumptuous meal): x visitors (not specified)
Total number of visitors so far: 188 + x

Now, we know that there were 557 visitors on Day 56 (the day after the meal). So, we can calculate the total number of visitors from Day 2 to Day 56 as follows:

Total number of visitors = 188 + (x + 557)
= 188 + 557 + x
= 745 + x

Since there were 71 paintings in the palace, and each visitor viewed all 71 paintings, we can calculate the average number of visitors per painting as follows:

Average number of visitors per painting = Total number of visitors / Number of paintings
= 745 + x / 71

We want to find out how many people visited the palace within 57 days, so we need to find the value of x that makes the above equation true for Day 57. In other words, we need to solve the equation for x:

x = 745 + x / 71 - 188

Solving for x, we get:

x = 930

So, there were 930 visitors to the Palace of Whitehall within 57 days."
Response:  There were 661 - 600 = 61 more visitors on that day compared to the previous day.
"Response:  There were 526 people who visited the Palace of Whitehall before the day that Rex and Rachel went there. To arrive at this number, we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace in total over the three days prior to the day that Rex and Rachel visited. We know that there were 419 visitors on the first day, 103 visitors on the second day, and 92 visitors on the third day (the day that Rex and Rachel visited). Therefore, the total number of visitors over the three days is:

419 + 103 + 92 = 614

So, there were 526 people who visited the Palace of Whitehall before the day that Rex and Rachel went there (614 - 92 = 526)."
Response:  In the past 89 days, there have been a total of 471 + 808 + 512 = 1891 people who visited the Buckingham Palace.

Response:  He already has 159 grams of wax, which is equal to 159/628 = 0.254 times the total amount of wax needed (628 grams). Therefore, he still needs 628 - 159 = 479 grams of wax.
Response:  The person has 260 grams of wax and needs 288 grams to cover all the feathers. So they have 260 - 288 = -28 grams of wax less than needed.
Response:  The person needs 22 kg of wax and 57 kg of paint to color the feathers. To calculate how much wax they already have, we need to know how much wax is needed for the total weight of the feathers. If the feathers weigh 353 kg, then the person needs 353 kg x 0.022 kg/g = 7.648 kg of wax. Since they already have 22 kg of wax, they still need 7.648 kg - 22 kg = 5.628 kg more wax.
"Response:  To find out how much more wax is needed, we need to subtract the amount of wax currently available (20g) from the total amount required for the feathers (166g). Therefore, the difference is:  

166g - 20g = 146g

So, an additional 146 grams of wax are needed."
Response:  The amount of wax needed is 557 - 17 = 540 grams.
Response:  The person needs an additional 481 grams of wax (492 - 11 = 481).

Response:  To build a wall with 4 nails per large wooden board and needing 2 boards per panel, John needs 4 x 2 = 8 panels to construct the house's walls.
Response:  To build the walls of a house, John needs 13 large wooden boards and 8 small wooden boards. Each large wooden board requires 17 screws to be fixed, and each small wooden board requires 8 screws to be fixed. Therefore, in total, John needs 13 x 17 = 221 screws for the large wooden boards and 8 x 8 = 64 screws for the small wooden boards, for a total of 221 + 64 = 285 screws.
Response:  To build the wall of a house, John needs to use 11 nails in total. Each wooden board requires 3 nails to be fixed, and he has used 8 extra nails. Therefore, John needs 11 / 3 = 3 wooden boards to build the wall of the house.
Response:  To build the walls of the house, John will need 12 x 15 = 180 nails for the large wooden planks and 10 x 5 = 50 nails for the small wooden planks, for a total of 180 + 50 = 230 nails.
Response:  To build the walls of a house using wooden planks, John needs 16 planks and each plank requires 2 screws to be fixed. Therefore, John needs 16 x 2 = 32 screws to build the walls of his house.
Response:  To calculate how many wooden planks John needs to build the walls of his house, we need to know how many planks he has and how many nails each plank requires. Let's assume that John has 8 wooden planks and each plank requires 74 nails. We can start by calculating the total number of nails required for all 8 planks: Total nails = 74 x 8 = 600 nails Now, let's calculate the total length of all the planks needed for the walls: Total length = (74 nails per plank) x (8 planks) = 600 nails x 8 planks = 4800 inches or 12 meters Since the wall is assumed to be 12 meters long, John will need 8 wooden planks to build it.
Response:  To build the walls of a house, John needs approximately 12 x 14 = 168 screws for each large wooden plank and 17 x 25 = 425 screws for each small wooden plank. In total, he will need 12 x 168 + 17 x 425 = 2072 screws to construct the walls of the house.

Response:  To find out how much money they made each day, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's say X represents the amount of money they made each day. Since they made $165 in total over 5 days, we know that 5X = 165. Now, we are told that they made the same amount of money every day, so we can simplify the equation to 5X = 165/5 = 33. Therefore, they made $33 per day.

Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  The person earns $420 - $50(30) = $370 in total after playing for 30 days. Therefore, their daily profit is $370 / 30 days = $12.33 per day."
"Response:  The total amount of money earned by the two players is:

382 + 374 = 756 dollars."
Response:  In the first 20 days of the carnival, the game made $120 / 20 = $6 per day.
"Response:  $19.86 (calculated below) 

Let X be the amount of money earned each day during the last 57 days. 
Since there are 57 days left in the carnival, we know that the total number of days is 154 + 57 = 211 days. 
We also know that the total earnings for the entire period are $325 + $114 = $439. 

Now, let's write an equation based on the information given: 
X \* 57 = 439 - 325 

Simplifying the equation: 
X \* 57 = 114 

Dividing both sides by 57: 
X = 114 / 57 

X = $19.86 (rounded to two decimal places) 

Therefore, the daily earnings for the last 57 days were $19.86."

"Response:  Based on the information provided, 露西 bought 23 packages of crackers and some packs of egg cakes. Let's assume she bought x packs of egg cakes. Since she has a total of 27 packages of miscellaneous items, we can set up the following equation:  

23 + x = 27 
Solving for x, we get: 

x = 4 
Therefore, 露西 bought 4 packs of egg cakes in addition to the 23 packages of crackers."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, 露西 spent 56元零钱 in total. Since she bought 2 packages of biscuits and 12 packs of cakes, we can calculate the cost of each item as follows:

2 packets of biscuits x 30 pieces per packet = 60 pieces of biscuits (at 5元 per packet) = 300元
12 packs of cakes x 4 pieces per pack = 48 pieces of cakes (at 4元 per pack) = 192元
Total cost = 300元 + 192元 = 56元
Therefore, 露西 bought a total of 56 packets of items (300 + 192)."
