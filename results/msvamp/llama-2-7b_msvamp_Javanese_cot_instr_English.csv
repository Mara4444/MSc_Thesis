Therefore, the correct answer is:  Karo is with their mother more often than Dina.;;
Response:  There are 18 girls in total, and 4 of them will go to school every Saturday. So, if we subtract the number of girls who will go to school from the total number of girls, we get 18 - 4 = 14 girls who won't go to school on Saturdays. Therefore, there are 14 girls who don't go to school on Saturdays.;;
Response:  There are 4 children in Julia's group and each child has to bring 2 snacks. So, total number of snacks that Julia needs to bring is 4 x 2 = 8. Now, there are 6 children in another group and each child has to bring 1 snack. Therefore, total number of snacks that the other group needs to bring is 6 x 1 = 6. Finally, there are 17 children in the third group and each child has to bring 1 snack. Hence, total number of snacks that this group needs to bring is 17 x 1 = 17. So, the total number of snacks that all three groups need to bring together is 8 + 6 + 17 = 31.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has seen 10 permanent teeth (banjur mangan). Then, he lost 25 temporary teeth (mengan sawetara). So, the number of remaining permanent teeth is 43 - 25 = 18. Therefore, the total number of teeth that Bobby has now is 18 permanent teeth and 0 temporary teeth, which means he has no more teeth to lose.;;
Response:  We know that Bobby has 28 permits and he sells each permit for Rp 42,000. So, the total amount of money he earns from selling permits is: 28 x Rp 42,000 = Rp 1,256,000. Now, we are asked how many pieces of chocolate Bobby can buy with this amount of money. To find out, we divide the total amount of money by the price of one piece of chocolate: Rp 1,256,000 / Rp 63,000 (price of one piece of chocolate) = 19.7 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby can buy 19.7 pieces of chocolate with the money he earned from selling permits.;;
Response:  Bobby has 33 pieces of permanganate and gives 4 to Banjur. So, he has 33 - 4 = 29 remaining pieces of permanganate. Then, he gets 14 pieces of chocolate from Dewike. So, his total number of chocolates is 29 + 14 = 43 pieces of chocolate.;;
Response:  Bobby has 38 pieces of permanganate and gives 36 to Banjur. So he still has 2 (38 - 36 = 2). Now, Dheweke takes 16 pieces of chocolate from Bobby. So now Bobby has 0 (2 - 16 = 0) pieces of chocolate left. Therefore, Piraya Manis has 2 pieces of permanganate remaining after giving some to Banjur and taking some from Bobby.;;
Response:  Bobby has 20 permanganates and Dewey has 34 permanganates. Bunjar has 18 meneh. So, if we divide the number of permanganates that Bobby has by the number of permanganates that Dewey has, we get:  $ \frac{20}{34} = 0.59$  Therefore, Pira permanganate is equal to $\boxed{\text{6}}$.;;
Response:  We know that Bobby has 21 pieces of permanganate and Dewey takes 5 pieces. So, there are 21 - 5 = 16 remaining pieces of permanganate left with Bobby. Then, Banjur takes 9 pieces of permanganate from Bobby, so now there are 16 - 9 = 7 remaining pieces of permanganate left with Bobby. Finally, we see that Pira takes 3 pieces of permanganate from Bobby, so now there are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining pieces of permanganate left with Bobby. Therefore, the answer is 4.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bobby has 22 permanent teeth. Then, we are told that Dewey has more than 22 permanent teeth. So, let's assume that Dewey has 30 permanent teeth. Now, we need to find out how many teeth Bobby has lost. We know that Bobby has lost 5 teeth, so he has 22 - 5 = 17 permanent teeth left. Finally, we need to divide the number of teeth that Bobby has left by the number of teeth that Dewey has to get the ratio of teeth between them. Therefore, the ratio of teeth between Bobby and Dewey is 17/30 or 1:2.;;
"Response:  Bobby has 19 pieces of permanganate. He wants to divide them into two portions so that each portion contains 2 pieces of permanganate. How many pieces of permanganate will Bob have in total after dividing them into two portions?

Answer: Total number of pieces of permanganate = Number of pieces of permanganate in one portion x Number of portions + Number of pieces of permanganate in one portion
= 19 x 2 + 19
= 38
Therefore, Bob will have 38 pieces of permanganate in total after dividing them into two portions.";;
Response:  If Bobby has 32 packets of instant noodles and he gives away 16 packets to his friend, then he has 32 - 16 = 16 packets left.  Now, if his friend takes 4 packets from him, then he has 16 - 4 = 12 packets left.  Finally, if he gives away 2 packets to his mother-in-law, then he has 12 - 2 = 10 packets left. So, the answer is 10 packets of instant noodles that Bobby has after giving them away.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that Bobby has. According to the question, he has 17 pieces of candy. Next, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that Mangan has. According to the question, he has 15 pieces of candy. Then, we need to subtract the number of pieces of candy that Mangan has from the number of pieces of candy that Bobby has. This gives us the difference between the two amounts, which is 2 (17 - 15). Finally, we multiply the difference by 36 (the number of keping permen in one bottle) to get the total number of pieces of candy that are left over after taking out 36 keping permen from each bottle. Therefore, there are 780 pieces of candy left over (2 x 36 = 72).;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of permanganate that Bobby has. According to the question, he has 23 pieces of permanganate. Next, we need to calculate the weight of each piece of permanganate in grams. The density of permanganate is approximately 1.45 g/cm^3. Therefore, the weight of one piece of permanganate can be calculated as follows: Weight = Density x Volume = 1.45 g/cm^3 x 0.023 kg (volume of one piece of permanganate) = 0.03175 kg Now, we have to calculate the total weight of all the pieces of permanganate that Bobby has. This can be done by multiplying the total number of pieces by the weight of each piece: Total weight = Number of pieces x Weight of each piece = 23 x 0.03175 kg = 0.68125 kg Finally, we need to convert the weight from kilograms to grams. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so we can divide the weight in kilograms by 1000 to get the weight in grams: Grams = Kilograms / 1000 = 0.68125 kg / 1000 = 0.0068125 kg So, the total weight of the permanganate that Bobby has is approximately 0.0068125 kg or 68.125 grams.;;
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 3 balls. If we put all of them in the park together, there will be 8 balls in total (5 + 3). So, if Allan puts some of his balls in the park, he will have fewer than 8 balls left. Therefore, the number of balls Allan has after putting some in the park is less than 8.;;
Response:  If Allan has 2 balls in the park and Jake has 3 balls in the same park, then there are a total of 5 balls (2 + 3) in the park. So, if one ball is thrown away from the park, there will be 4 balls left in the park (2 + 3 - 1).;;
Response:  If Allan threw 3 balls into the park and Jake caught 2 of them in the park, then there are 1 ball left that is not caught by Jake. So, the answer is 1.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 6 balls in his garden and he wants to give 4 of them to Allan. So, the number of balls left with Jake is 6 - 4 = 2. Now, we need to find out how many balls Allan has after receiving the 4 balls from Jake. Therefore, the final answer is 2 + 4 = 6.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 5 balls in the garden and Jake has 6 balls which are not evenly distributed among the different areas of the garden. So, to find out how many balls Jake has in each area of the garden, we need to divide his total number of balls (6) by the number of areas in the garden (3). Therefore, Jake has 2 balls in each area of the garden. Now, let's calculate the total number of balls that Allan has after Jake has placed his 2 balls in each area of the garden. We know that Allan had 5 balls initially, so he still has 5 balls left after Jake has placed his 2 balls in each area. Hence, the final answer is 5 + 2 = 7 balls.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 3 balls in the park and Jake has 5 balls in the park. Then, Allan takes 2 of his balls from the park to another place. So, now Allan has 1 ball left in the park, while Jake still has 5 balls in the park. Therefore, the final number of balls that Jake has is 5 + 1 = 6 balls in the park.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 2 balls in the park and Jake has 4 balls in the park. Then, we are told that Allan threw 3 of his balls into the pond. So, now Allan has 2 - 3 = 1 ball left in the park. On the other hand, Jake still has 4 balls in the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Allan has in the park is less than the number of balls that Jake has in the park, so the answer is A (Allan).;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has 6 balls in the park and Allan takes 3 of them. So, there are 6 - 3 = 3 balls left in the park after Allan took some. Now, let's consider how many balls Jake had initially before giving any to Allan. We know that Jake had 2 balls initially. Therefore, the final number of balls that Jake has after giving one ball to Allan is 2 + 1 (the one he gave to Allan) = 3 balls. So, the correct answer is 3.;;
Response:  We know that Jake has 4 balls in the park and Allan takes 3 of them from there. So, now Jake has 4 - 3 = 1 ball left in the park. Therefore, one of Allan's balls is in the park.;;
Response:  Allan has 6 balls in the park and gives 2 to Jake. So, Allan now has 4 balls left (6 - 2 = 4). Jake has 3 balls that he found in the park. Therefore, the number of balls that Allan has after giving some to Jake is 4.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 6 balls in the park and Jake has 3 balls in the park. Then, Jake throws one ball away from him, which means he now has 4 balls left in the park. So, the final number of balls that Jake has in the park is 4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.;;
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balls in the park and Jake has 6 balls in the park. If Jake takes 3 balls from the park, then he will have 9 balls left (6 + 3 = 9). So, the number of balls that Jake has outside the park is 9.;;
Response:  If Allan has 3 balls and throws them into the park, then there are 3 x 2 = 6 balls in the park.  If Jake has 5 balls and throws them into the same park, then there are now 6 + 5 = 11 balls in the park.;;
Response:  Allan has 7 balls and gives 5 to Jack. So, Allan now has 2 balls left (7 - 5 = 2).  Then, Jack has 6 balls and gives 4 to Allan. So, Jack now has 2 balls left (6 - 4 = 2), and Allan has all of Jack's remaining 4 balls. Therefore, the final number of balls that Allan has is 6 + 4 = 10.;;
Response:  If Allan has 5 balls and gives one to Jake, then Allan has 4 balls left.  If Jake already has 6 balls from the park, then the total number of balls they have between them is 10 (4 + 6).;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan has 5 balls in his garden and Jake has 6 balls in his park. So, the total number of balls is 5 + 6 = 11 balls. Therefore, the answer to the question is 11.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan can speak English for 6 hours and Chinese for 2 hours. So, in total, he has spent 8 hours speaking both languages combined (6 hours + 2 hours = 8 hours). Now, let's calculate how much time he spends speaking each language relative to the other. To do this, we divide the number of hours he spends speaking each language by the total number of hours he has spent speaking both languages. In this case, Ryan spends more time speaking Chinese than English, so we can say that his ratio of speaking Chinese to speaking English is 8/4 = 2. Therefore, Ryan spends twice as much time speaking Chinese as he does speaking English.;;
Response:  If it takes 6 hours to learn basic English vocabulary and 7 hours to learn basic Chinese vocabulary, how many more hours will it take to learn basic Chinese vocabulary compared to learning basic English vocabulary? So, the difference in time is 7 - 6 = 1 hour. Therefore, it will take 1 hour longer to learn basic Chinese vocabulary than to learn basic English vocabulary.;;
Response:  If it takes 3 hours to learn English in Bali and 4 hours to learn Chinese, how many hours will it take to learn both languages simultaneously?  We can calculate this as follows:  Time to learn English = 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week  Time to learn Chinese = 4 hours/day x 7 days/week = 28 hours/week  Total time to learn both languages = 21 hours/week + 28 hours/week = 49 hours/week So, it would take approximately 49 hours per week to learn both English and Chinese simultaneously.;;
Response:  If we have 7 hours to learn English and want to know how many hours it takes to learn Chinese, let's assume that learning Chinese is twice as difficult as learning English. So if it takes 7 hours to learn English, it will take 14 hours (2 x 7) to learn Chinese. Therefore, the answer is 14 hours.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan can speak Chinese for 5 hours continuously. If he wants to learn English in the same way, he needs to practice speaking English for 10 hours (5 hours x 2). So, Ryan needs to practice speaking English for 10 hours non-stop to catch up with his Chinese language skills.;;
Response:  If you can speak English for 6 hours and Chinese for 7 hours per day, and you practice speaking for 5 days, then in total, you will have spoken English for 6 x 24 = 144 hours and Chinese for 7 x 24 = 168 hours. So, your total speaking time is 144 + 168 = 312 hours.;;
Response:  If you can speak English for 6 hours and Chinese for 5 hours per day, and you want to know how many days it will take to become fluent in both languages, we need to calculate the total number of hours spent learning each language first.  Therefore, the total number of hours spent learning English is 6 x 24 = 144 hours, and the total number of hours spent learning Chinese is 5 x 24 = 120 hours.  Now, let's assume that one hour of studying a language requires a certain level of proficiency. For simplicity, let's say that one hour of study equals one level of proficiency. With this assumption, if you spend 144 hours studying English and reach level N, then you will have reached level (N + 1) after spending an additional 144 hours studying English. Similarly, if you spend 120 hours studying Chinese and reach level M, then you will have reached level (M + 1) after spending an additional 120 hours studying Chinese.  Based on these calculations, it would take approximately 73 days to become fluent in both English and Chinese, assuming that one hour of study equals one level of proficiency. However, please note that this is just an estimate, as the actual time required to become fluent may vary depending on individual factors such as learning style, motivation, and prior knowledge of the language.;;
"Response:  If it takes 5 hours to learn English and 4 hours to learn Chinese, and you can study for 6 days a week, how many hours will it take to learn both languages in total?

Answer:  Total hours = (English learning time x number of weeks) + (Chinese learning time x number of weeks)
Total hours = (5 hours/week x 6 weeks) + (4 hours/week x 6 weeks)
Total hours = 30 hours + 24 hours
Total hours = 54 hours
Therefore, it will take approximately 54 hours to learn both English and Chinese if you study for 6 days a week.";;
Response:  If you can speak English for 4 hours and Chinese for 6 hours per day, in total, you will have spoken English for 120 minutes (4 x 30) and Chinese for 720 minutes (6 x 30). So, in total, you will have spoken 900 minutes (120 + 720) of English and 5760 minutes (720 x 8) of Chinese.;;
Response:  If it takes 6 hours to learn English in 7 days and 3 hours to learn Spanish, how many hours will it take to learn Chinese?  We know that learning any language requires consistent effort over time. So let's calculate the total number of hours required to reach fluency in each language based on the given information.  For English: 6 x 7 = 42 hours  For Chinese: 6 x 8 = 48 hours  For Spanish: 6 x 3 = 18 hours Therefore, if you want to become fluent in all three languages, you would need to spend approximately 42 hours learning English, 48 hours learning Chinese, and 18 hours learning Spanish.;;
Response:  If Ryan can speak English for 6 hours, he can speak Chinese for 3 hours, and he can speak Spanish for 58 hours, then we know that his total speaking time is equal to the sum of these three times. So, if we convert all the times into hours, we get:  English = 6 x 60 = 360 minutes  Chinese = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes  Spanish = 58 x 60 = 3440 minutes Total speaking time = 360 + 180 + 3440 = 3980 minutes Now, let's find out how many minutes Ryan spent learning each language. To do this, we divide the total speaking time by the number of hours he spent learning each language: English = 3980 minutes / 6 hours = 663 minutes Chinese = 3980 minutes / 3 hours = 1327 minutes Spanish = 3980 minutes / 58 hours = 685 minutes Based on the calculations above, Ryan spent more time learning Spanish than any other language.;;
Response:  If Ryan can speak English for 7 hours and Chinese for 2 hours, then he has spent a total of 9 hours speaking those languages (7 + 2 = 9).  If he spends 4 hours speaking Spanish, then he has spent a total of 13 hours speaking all three languages combined (9 + 4 = 13). So, the difference in time spent speaking each language is: 13 - 9 = 4 hours.;;
Response:  If it takes 2 hours to learn English in 5 hours, then we can calculate the rate of learning as follows:  Rate of learning = Time taken to learn English / Total time available for learning = 2/5 = 0.4 or 40% per hour.  Similarly, if it takes 4 hours to learn Spanish in 8 hours, then the rate of learning is: Rate of learning = Time taken to learn Spanish / Total time available for learning = 4/8 = 0.5 or 50% per hour.  Now, let's compare the rates of learning between Chinese and Spanish: Rate of learning Chinese = 0.67 (or 67%) per hour Rate of learning Spanish = 0.5 (or 50%) per hour Based on these calculations, it seems that Chinese is learned faster than Spanish at this particular rate of learning. However, please note that this is just an estimate based on the given information and may not be entirely accurate.;;
Response:  If it takes 3 hours to learn English in 3 days, and we want to know how many hours of Chinese learning can be done in 2 hours of English learning time, we need to divide the number of hours spent learning English by 2. So, if it takes 3 hours to learn English in 3 days, then dividing that by 2 gives us 1.5 hours of Chinese learning time per day. Therefore, the answer is 1.5 hours.;;
Response:  If Ryan can speak English for 7 days and he spends 4 hours speaking English every day, then in total, he has spent 28 hours (4 x 7) speaking English. Now, if he spends 5 hours speaking Chinese every day, then in total, he has spent 140 hours (5 x 28) speaking Chinese. So, the difference between the time he spends speaking English and Chinese is 112 hours (140 - 28). Therefore, Ryan spends more time speaking Chinese than English.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 bags of rice in total. Then, we have to calculate how many bags of rice are left after 7 bags are taken out. So, the number of bags of rice left is equal to the total number of bags minus the number of bags taken out. In this case, the calculation is as follows: Total number of bags = 8 Bags taken out = 7 Bags left = 8 - 7 = 1 bag of rice. Therefore, there is one bag of rice left after 7 bags are taken out.;;
Response:  We have 7 days in a week and each day has 8 hours. So we have 7 x 8 = 56 hours in a week. Now let's calculate how many hours are left after working for 12 hours per day.  We have 56 - 12 = 44 hours left in a week. Therefore, the answer is 44 hours.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 kinds of Kaleng (Kaleng A, B, C, and D). Each kind has different filling materials, such as beans, rice, or vegetables. We will assume that each kind of Kaleng contains an equal amount of filling material, regardless of its size. Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the Kaleng in the picture:  For Kaleng A, we have 30 pieces x 15 grams/piece = 450 grams  For Kaleng B, we have 20 pieces x 20 grams/piece = 400 grams  For Kaleng C, we have 15 pieces x 30 grams/piece = 450 grams  For Kaleng D, we have 25 pieces x 40 grams/piece = 1000 grams  Therefore, the total weight of all the Kaleng in the picture is: 450 + 400 + 450 + 1000 = 2300 grams  Next, we need to find out how much each piece of Kaleng weighs. Since there are 6 pieces of Kaleng in the picture, we can divide the total weight by 6 to get the weight of each piece:  So, each piece of Kaleng weighs approximately 383 grams (2300 grams / 6 pieces).;;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week and today is Monday (Senin). So, the number of days left until next Monday (Rabu) is 6 days.

Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the number of persik (pears) in Abang's basket. There are 17 pears in Abang's basket. Next, we need to count the number of pears in Ijo's basket. There are 16 pears in Ijo's basket. Now, let's compare the number of pears in both baskets. The difference between the number of pears in Abang's and Ijo's baskets is 1 (17 - 16 = 1). Therefore, there is one more pear in Abang's basket than in Ijo's basket.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of persik (pears) that Abang has given to Ijo. According to the question, Abang gave 5 pears to Ijo. Therefore, the total number of pears that Abang has given is 5.  Next, we need to count the number of pears that Ijo has received from Abang. Based on the question, Ijo received 11 pears from Abang. So, the total number of pears that Ijo has received is 11.  Now, let's compare the number of pears that Abang has given and the number of pears that Ijo has received. The difference between these two numbers is 6 (11 - 5). Therefore, the answer to the question is 6.;;
Response:  We have 10 apples in one basket and 5 apples in another basket. So, we have a total of 15 apples (10 + 5).;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many persimmon fruits Abang Lan has given away. According to the question, he gave away 3 persimmons. Therefore, the number of persimmons Abang Lan has is 3. Now, let's count the number of persimmons that Sawetara Persik Ijo Liyane has received from Abang Lan. The question states that she received 10 persimmons from him. So, the total number of persimmons that Sawetara Persik Ijo Liyane has is 10. Finally, let's calculate the number of persimmons that remain with Abang Lan after giving them away to Sawetara Persik Ijo Liyane. To do this, we need to subtract the number of persimmons Abang Lan gave away (3) from the total number of persimmons he had (10). Therefore, the number of persimmons remaining with Abang Lan is 7.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have 7 red apples + 15 yellow apples = 22 apples in total. Then, we have 8 green apples and 1 orange apple. So, the total number of apples is 22 + 8 + 1 = 31 apples. Therefore, there are 31 apples in the bowl.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of persik (pears) in each group: Group 1: 7 persik + 71 persik = 78 persik Group 2: 8 persik + 1 persik = 9 persik Now, let's calculate the total number of pears: Total number of pears = Number of pears in Group 1 + Number of pears in Group 2 = 78 + 9 = 87 persik Therefore, there are 87 pears in total.;;

Therefore, the number of mature persimmons is 7.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of persik (pears) in each group: Persik Abang - 19 persik Persik Kuning - 12 persik Pira Luwih - none Since there are no pears in the ""Pira Luwih"" category, we don't need to count them. Now let's add up all the numbers: 19 + 12 = 31 So, there are 31 pears in total.";;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of persik (pears) that Abang has. Persik Abang = 6 + 90 = 96 Next, we need to calculate the total number of persik that King has. Persik King = 16 + 32 = 48 Finally, we compare the total number of persik owned by Abang and King. If Abang has more than King, then Abang is the winner. In this case, Abang has 96 persik while King has 48 persik, so Abang wins! Therefore, the answer is: Abang wins!;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of persik (oranges) in each group: Abang - 18 persik + 14 persik = 32 persik Kuning - 17 persik + 17 persik = 34 persik Pira - None Persik ijo - None Kranjang - None Now, let's calculate the total number of persik in all groups: Total number of persik = 32 + 34 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 66 persik Therefore, the answer is 66 persik.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have 5 red apples and 14 yellow apples. Then, we have 6 green apples and 3 orange apples. Finally, we have 2 pears and 1 banana. So, the total number of fruits is: 5 + 14 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 38 fruits. Therefore, the answer is 38.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many apples Ana has given away. According to the question, Ana gave 65 kranjangs (which are equivalent to apples) to Persik. So, Ana has given away 65 x 2 = 130 apples in total. Now, let's count the number of apples that Persik received from Ana and Abang. According to the question, Persik received 7 apples from Ana and 3 apples from Abang. Therefore, the total number of apples that Persik received is 7 + 3 = 10 apples. Finally, we need to subtract the number of apples that Persik received from the total number of apples that Ana gave away to get the number of apples that Ana kept for herself. So, the answer is: Ana kept 130 - 10 = 120 apples for herself.;;
Response:  Kranjang (Ana) has 11 apples and Persik (Abang) has 10 oranges.  If we combine their fruits, Ana will have 11 + 10 = 21 apples and Abang will have 10 + 18 = 28 oranges. So, the total number of fruit is 21 + 28 = 59.;;
Response:  Kranjang (ana) = 6 x 16 = 96 Persik Abang (ibu) = 18 x 2 = 36 Persik Ijo (abang) = 18 x 1 = 18 Total number of persimmon fruits = 96 + 36 + 18 = 150 Therefore, there are 150 persimmon fruits in total.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count how many apples Ana has given away. According to the question, Ana gave away 7 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Ana has left is: 7 - 7 = 0 apples. Now, let's count how many oranges Persik has received from Abang and Ijo. According to the question, Persik received 2 oranges from Abang and 10 oranges from Ijo. Therefore, the total number of oranges Persik has received is: 2 + 10 = 12 oranges. Finally, let's calculate the remaining number of oranges after subtracting the number of oranges Persik received from the number of apples Ana had left: 0 (Ana's apples) - 12 (oranges Persik received) = -12 oranges. So, the answer is -12 oranges.;;
Response:  Ana has 4 Kranjangs and each Kranjang contains 3 Persiks. So, in total, Ana has 4 x 3 = 12 Persiks. Now, there are 7 Persiks inside the basket. Therefore, the number of Persiks that Ana has is 12 - 7 = 5 Persiks.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ana has 2 kranjangs (persimmons) and Persik has 4 kranjangs. Then, Abang gives 1 kranjang to Lan, so now Ana has 3 kranjangs left. Next, Sawetara gives 2 kranjangs to Liyane, so now Ana has 5 kranjangs left. Finally, Yen gives 4 kranjangs to Kabeh, so now Ana has 9 kranjangs in total. Therefore, the answer is 9.;;
Response:  We have 16 persimmons in total and 13 of them are Abang Lan's. So, there are 3 persimmons left that belong to Ijo Liyane. Therefore, Piri Pirus has 3 persimmons in his basket.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of persimmons in Ana's basket. According to the question, there are 19 persimmons in Ana's basket. Next, we need to calculate the number of persimmons that Abang has given to Lan. The question states that Abang gave 4 persimmons to Lan. Therefore, the total number of persimmons that Abang has is 4 + 19 = 23 persimmons. Now, let's calculate the number of persimmons that Ijo has received from Abang and Ana. According to the question, Ijo received 15 kranjangs (baskets) of persimmons from Abang and Ana combined. Since each kranjang contains 4 persimmons, the total number of persimmons that Ijo received is 15 x 4 = 60 persimmons. Finally, let's calculate the remaining number of persimmons in Ana's original basket. To do this, we subtract the number of persimmons that Abang gave to Lan and the number of persimmons that Ijo received from Abang and Ana from the total number of persimmons in Ana's basket. Therefore, the remaining number of persimmons in Ana's basket is 19 - (23 + 60) = -41 persimmons. So, the answer is -41 persimmons.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many apples Ana has given away. According to the question, Ana gave away 10 apples. So, Ana has 4 apples left (Ana had 10 - 4 = 6 apples initially). Now, let's count Persik's apples. Persik has 6 apples in total (Persik had 6 + 4 = 10 apples initially). Therefore, the final number of apples that Persik and Ana have is as follows: Persik has 6 apples, and Ana has 4 apples.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of persimmon fruits in each basket:  Basket 1: 6 persimmons (i jo)  Basket 2: 60 persimmons (kuning)  Basket 3: 2 persimmons (abang) Now, let's calculate the total number of persimmons in all three baskets: Total number of persimmons = Number of persimmons in Basket 1 + Number of persimmons in Basket 2 + Number of persimmons in Basket 3 Total number of persimmons = 6 + 60 + 2 = 78 Therefore, there are 78 persimmons in all three baskets combined.;;

Response:  We have 7 pages in total (Ana has 1 page).  Each page contains 4 lines of text (as per the given information). So, we can calculate the number of words as follows: Page 1 - 4 lines x 7 pages = 28 words Page 2 - 4 lines x 7 pages = 28 words... Page 7 - 4 lines x 7 pages = 28 words Total number of words = 28 + 28 + 28 + 28 + 28 + 28 = 192 words Therefore, there are 192 words in Ana's book.;;
Response:  We have 4 manuk (apples) in one bag and we want to know how many manuk are in all bags together. So, if each bag has 4 apples, then the total number of apples in all bags is 4 x 5 = 20 apples. Therefore, there are 20 manuk (apples) in all bags together.;;
Response:  We have 4 men (manuk) and 46 storks (storks). Each stork can carry one chicken (pager), so in total we have 4 x 46 = 182 chickens that each stork can carry. Now, let's see how many chickens are left after 6 men join together to carry them. If they all carry one chicken each, then there will be 6 x 1 = 6 chickens left. So, the answer is 182 - 6 = 176 chickens.;;
Response:  We have 3 cranes (manuk) and 2 storks (burung gagak). If we combine them all together, there will be 5 birds in total (manuk + burung gagak = 5). So, the answer is 5.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have three mice (manuk) and four storks (storks). We need to find out how many pairs of mice and storks are there. To do this, we can divide the number of mice by two, as each mouse needs a partner. So, we have 3 / 2 = 1.5 pairs of mice and storks. Now, let's count the remaining mice and storks. There are 1.5 pairs left, so we subtract that from the total number of mice and storks. Therefore, the answer is 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 pairs of mice and storks.;;
Response:  We have 2 manuk (swallows) and 6 storks (cranes). If we combine them, we will get 8 birds in total. Now, if we add 3 more swallows to this group, we will have 11 birds in total. So, the answer is 11.;;
Response:  We have 4 men (manuk) and 6 storks (gagak). Each man can carry one bird (loro), so in total we have 4 x 1 = 4 birds carried by the men. Now, each stork can carry 2 birds (ngubengi), so in total we have 6 x 2 = 12 birds carried by the storks. Therefore, there are 4 - 12 = -8 birds left after the men and storks have finished carrying them.;;
Response:  We have 3 cranes (manuk) and 4 storks (gagak). Each crane can carry 2 bags of rice (lingguh), so we have 3 x 2 = 6 bags of rice carried by the cranes. Now, each stork can carry 5 bags of rice (mèlu), so we have 4 x 5 = 20 bags of rice carried by the storks. In total, we have 6 + 20 = 26 bags of rice carried by both cranes and storks. Therefore, the number of bags of rice that the crane can carry is 26.;;
"Response:  We have 6 cranes (manuk) and 3 storks (gagak). Each crane can carry one chicken (langu) at a time, while each stork can carry two chickens (ngubengi) at a time. So, in total, we have:

6 x 1 = 6 chickens carried by cranes
3 x 2 = 6 chickens carried by storks

Therefore, the total number of chickens carried by both cranes and storks is 6 + 6 = 12 chickens.";;
Response:  We have 4 cranes (manuk) and 3 storks (gagak). Each crane can carry 2 bags of rice (lingguh), so we have 8 bags of rice in total from the cranes. Now, each stork can carry 1 bag of rice (lungguh), so we have 3 bags of rice in total from the storks. Therefore, the total number of bags of rice that the birds can carry is 8 + 3 = 11 bags of rice.;;
Response:  We have 6 men (manuk) and each of them has a child (lingu). So, in total we have 6 + 6 = 12 people. Now, there are 4 men who want to go to the market (liyané), so they will take their children with them. That means there are 4 x 2 = 8 children left behind at home. Therefore, the number of people who went to the market is 12 - 8 = 4.;;
Response:  We have 5 maneki neko (storks) and each of them can carry 4 bags of rice. So, in total, we have 5 x 4 = 20 bags of rice carried by the storks. Now, let's calculate how many times 20 bags of rice fit into one page. One bag of rice is approximately equal to 1 kg or 1000 grams. Therefore, 20 bags of rice would be equivalent to 20 x 1 kg = 20,000 grams. And finally, we divide this amount by the weight of one page, which is approximately 70 grams. So, the answer is 20,000 / 70 = 285 pages.;;
Response:  We have 3 men (Manuk) and they are playing pagar (a traditional game of Indonesia). Each man has one lungguh (a small ball made of wood or plastic), so we have 3 lungguhs in total. Now, let's count how many times each man can hit the lungguh with their stick:  Man 1 : Can hit the lungguh 6 times (since there are 6 men around him).  Man 2 : Can hit the lungguh 5 times (since there are already 6 men around him, including himself).  Man 3 : Can hit the lungguh only once (since he is the last one to play). So, the final answer is: 3 + 5 + 1 = 9. Therefore, the number of times the burung gagak (a type of bird) will fly after being hit by the lungguh is 9.;;
Response:  We have 5 bangaus (monkeys) and 3 manuks (storks). The monkeys are holding onto the branches of a tree with long vines. There are 4 manuks waiting below to grab them when they fall. If each monkey weighs approximately 10 kg, how much will all these creatures weigh in total?  Solution:  Firstly, let's calculate the weight of the monkeys. Since there are 5 monkeys, their total weight is 5 x 10 kg = 50 kg. Next, let's calculate the weight of the storks. Since there are 3 storks, their total weight is 3 x 20 kg = 60 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the creatures is 50 kg + 60 kg = 110 kg.;;
Response:  We have 6 bangs (bangaus) and 2 manuks (manuks). If we combine them, we get 8 birds in total. Now, if we subtract the number of birds that can fit on one page (3), we are left with 5 birds that cannot fit on one page. Therefore, the answer is 5.;;
Response:  We have 3 birds (manuk) and they are sitting on 6 nests (gagak). Each nest can hold 2 birds, so we have a total of 12 birds in all (6 x 2 = 12). Now, let's count how many birds are left after one bird from each nest has flown away to another tree (pira manèh). So, out of the remaining 12 birds, 3 birds will fly away, leaving us with 9 birds in total (12 - 3 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 birds left in the area after one bird from each nest has flown away to another tree.;;
Response:  Bab Iki has 2 bab and each baby has 48 kacas. Therefore, the total number of kacas is: 2 x 48 = 96 kacas. Now, let's check how many kacas Bab Kapindo has. Bab Kapindo has 11 kacas. So, the difference between the total number of kacas and the number of kacas Bab Kapindo has is: Total number of kacas - Number of kacas Bab Kapindo = 96 - 11 = 85 kacas. Therefore, the answer is 85 kacas.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two bab (bab means ""baby"" in Indonesian). So, the total number of bab is 2.  Next, we know that each baby has 37 or 80 toys, depending on which baby it is. Therefore, the total number of toys for both babies is: 2 x 37 = 74 toys and 2 x 80 = 160 toys. Finally, we need to find out how many toys one baby has. Since there are two babies, the total number of toys for one baby is half of the total number of toys for both babies: 160 / 2 = 80 toys. So, the answer is 80 toys.";;
Response:  We have two books with 2 pages each, so we have a total of 4 pages. Each page has 60 words, so we have a total of 240 words in both books combined. Now, let's calculate how many words are written in one book:  Number of words in one book = Total number of words / Number of books Therefore, the number of words in one book is:  Number of words in one book = 240 words / 2 books = 120 words per book. So, there are 120 words in one book.;;
Response:  We have two books with 20 and 15 pages respectively. If we want to know how many pages there are in total, we can simply add the number of pages of each book together. So, the total number of pages is 20 + 15 = 35 pages.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many books are in each pile of books. From the question, we know that there are 3 piles of books, and each pile has a different number of books. The first pile has 66 books, the second pile has 35 books, and the third pile has 24 books. So, the total number of books is equal to the sum of these numbers: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 books. Now, let's calculate the average number of books per pile: To do this, we divide the total number of books by the number of piles of books: 125 books / 3 piles = 41.67 books per pile (round up to 42 books per pile). Finally, we can calculate the total number of kaca (or eggs) needed for each book: Since each book requires 3 kaca, we multiply the number of books per pile by 3 to get the total number of kaca required for each pile: 42 books/pile x 3 kaca/book = 126 kaca per pile. Therefore, the total number of kaca needed for all three piles of books is 126 kaca x 3 piles = 380 kaca.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three books in total. Each book has 91 pages, so the total number of pages is 91 x 3 = 273 pages. Now, let's calculate the number of words in each book:  Number of words per page = Total number of words / Number of pages  In this case, the number of words per page is 273 / 91 = 3.  So, the first book contains 3 x 91 = 273 words. Similarly, the second book contains 3 x 91 = 273 words, and the third book contains 3 x 23 = 69 words. Therefore, the total number of words in all three books is 273 + 273 + 69 = 605 words.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three rooms in total (bab). For room 1 (bab kapisan), there are 35 windows (kaca). For room 2 (bab kapindo), there are 18 windows. And for room 3 (bab kate lu), there is only one window (kaca). So, altogether, there are 3 x 35 = 105 windows in all three rooms combined. Now, let's calculate how many panes of glass each room has. Room 1 has 35 windows with 9 panes per window, so it has 35 x 9 = 315 panes of glass. Room 2 has 18 windows with 6 panes per window, so it has 18 x 6 = 108 panes of glass. And Room 3 has 1 window with 4 pane;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pieces of glass are in each box. According to the question, there are 3 boxes, and each box contains 53 pieces of glass for Box A, 75 pieces of glass for Box B, and 21 pieces of glass for Box C. Therefore, the total number of pieces of glass in all three boxes is: 53 + 75 + 21 = 149 pieces of glass. Next, we need to calculate the average value of these pieces of glass. To do this, we divide the total number of pieces of glass by the number of boxes: 149 / 3 = 49 pieces of glass per box. Finally, we can multiply the number of pieces of glass per box by the price of each piece of glass to get the total cost of all the glass: 49 x $10 = $490. So, the total cost of all the glass is $490.;;
Response:  We know that there are 31 pages in the book and each page has 61 words. So, the total number of words in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1891.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 2 books in total. Each book has 23 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages is 2 x 23 = 46 pages. Now, we need to find out how many pages have been torn off from one book. We are told that Bab Sing Jembaré tore off 10 pages from one book. So, the remaining pages in that book are 46 - 10 = 36 pages. Now, let's move on to the second book. We know that Bab Kapisan ripped off 5 pages from this book. Therefore, the remaining pages in this book are 46 - 5 = 41 pages. Finally, we add up the number of pages in both books to get the total number of pages torn off: 36 + 41 = 77 pages. So, the answer is 77 pages.;;
Response:  We have two rectangles with different dimensions:  The first rectangle has a length of 81 cm and a width of 20 cm, so its area is: A = L x W = 81 x 20 = 1620 cm^2.  The second rectangle has a length of 68 cm and a width of 30 cm, so its area is: A = L x W = 68 x 30 = 2040 cm^2. Now we need to find out how many times the area of the second rectangle can fit into the area of the first one. To do this, we divide the area of the first rectangle by the area of the second rectangle: Number of times the area of the second rectangle fits into the area of the first one = Area of the first rectangle / Area of the second rectangle = 1620 cm^2 / 2040 cm^2 = 0.79 or approximately 1/1.25. So, pira (or ratio) of the number of squares in the second rectangle that can be placed horizontally inside the first rectangle is approximately 1/1.25 or 0.80.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of ways in which Wong Sing can be written as a combination of letters from the word ""ingwayah"". We have 5 letters in total - i, n, g, w, and h. So, there are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible combinations. Now, let's count the number of times each letter appears in each combination. For example, the letter ""i"" appears once in the combination ""in"", twice in the combination ""ining"", thrice in the combination ""ingwayah"", etc. Therefore, the frequency of each letter is:  I - 120/5 = 24  N - 120/5 = 24  G - 120/5 = 24  W - 120/5 = 24  H - 120/5 = 24 Next, we need to find out how many times each letter appears in the remaining part of the question (after ""kem""). There are 7 letters left after ""kem"": e, l, u, y, a, o, and r. Each of these letters appears only once in the remaining part of the question, so their frequencies are: E - 1 = 1  L - 1 = 1 U - 1 = 1 Y - 1 = 1 A - 1 = 1 O - 1 = 1 R - 1 = 1 Finally, we add up the frequencies of all the letters to get the total number of ways in which Wong Sing can be written as a combination of letters from the words ""ingwayah"" and ""kem"". Therefore, the answer is: Total number of ways = Frequency of ""I"" + Frequency of ""N"" + Frequency of ""G"" + Frequency of ""W"" + Frequency of ""H"" + Frequency of ""E"" + Frequency of ""L"" + Frequency of ""U"" + Frequency of ""Y"" + Frequency of ""A"" + Frequency of ""O"" + Frequency of ""R"" = 24 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many ways there are for Wong Sing to eat his meal in Kemah Kuwi Nglayar Ing Wayah. There are 3 options for him - he can either eat at table A, B or C. So, the number of ways is 3 x 3 = 9.  Next, we need to find out how many ways there are for Pi Rame to eat her meal in Kemah Kuwi Nglayar Ing Wayah while Wong Sing is eating at table A. Since she has only one option, which is to eat at table D, the number of ways is 1. Similarly, we can calculate the number of ways for each of the other two options (eating at tables B and C) and get 3 and 4 respectively. Therefore, the total number of ways for Pi Rame to eat her meal while Wong Sing is eating at table A is 1 + 3 + 4 = 8. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question where we need to find out how many ways there are for all three of them (Wong Sing, Pi Rame, and Awang) to eat their meals together in Kemah Kuwi Nglayar Ing Wayah. We know that they have a total of 9 options for this since they can choose any combination of tables A, B, and C. Therefore, the number of ways is 9 x 3 = 27. Finally, we need to find out how many ways there are for all four of them (including Awang) to eat their meals together in Kemah Kuwi Nglayar Ing Wayah. This time, we have a total of 10 options since they can choose from among tables A, B, C, and D. Therefore, the number of ways is 10 x 4 = 40.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 people in total (wong) and they will be divided into groups of 4 (sing). So, the number of groups is 15 / 4 = 3.75 groups. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a group, let's round up to 4 groups. Therefore, there will be 4 x 4 = 16 people in each group (kemah). Now, we need to calculate how many times these groups can go for a boat ride (rowing) in one afternoon. We know that there are 32 tyangs (tents) available at the campsite, so each group can use 1 tent. Since there are 4 groups, the total number of tents used will be 4 x 32 = 128 tents. Finally, we divide the total number of tents used by the number of afternoons available (in this case, 1 day), which gives us the answer of 128 tents / 1 day = 128 tents per day.;;
Response:  We know that there are 7 campers who go rowing in the afternoon. Each camper takes turns rowing for 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to complete one round of rowing is 60 minutes x 7 campers = 420 minutes.;;
Response:  We know that there are 36 campers who went for a long day of fishing in the morning and 13 more campers joined them in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers is 36 + 13 = 49.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of campers who went for a long day at the beach in the morning and afternoon.  For this, we can use the information provided in the question that there were 44 campers who went for a long day at the beach in the morning.  Therefore, the total number of campers who went for a long day at the beach is: 44 + 39 = 83 campers.  Next, we need to calculate the number of campers who stayed behind at the campsite during the same period.  According to the question, there were 31 campers who stayed behind at the campsite during the whole day (morning and afternoon).  Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who went for a long day at the beach and those who stayed behind at the campsite is: 83 - 31 = 52 campers.  Finally, we need to determine how many campers went for a short day trip to Wayah Sore.  The question does not provide any information about this, so we cannot calculate it directly from the given data.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many campers are there in total. From the question, we know that there are 53 campers who went for a long day of activities during the morning and then returned at noon (ing esuk). Then, we are asked about the number of campers who went for another long day of activities in the afternoon (wayah sore). So, we need to subtract the number of campers who were already at the campsite in the morning from the total number of campers. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of campers left at the campsite = Total number of campers - Number of campers who went for a long day of activities in the morning.  In this case, the total number of campers is 53, and the number of campers who went for a long day of activities in the morning is 48. So, the number of campers left at the campsite is:  Number of campers left at the campsite = 53 - 48 = 5.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 33 campers who went for a long-day hike in the morning. Then, we are asked how many of them will return in the evening. Since they have been hiking all day, it is likely that most of them will be tired and want to rest when they return. Therefore, we can assume that only 10 of them will continue their journey until late at night. So, the final number of campers who will arrive late at night is 10.;;

Response:  We know that Ed has 2 marbles and he gave 1 to Doug. So, Ed now has 1 marble left.  Then, we are told that Doug has 19 balls in total. Therefore, the number of marbles that Doug has is 19 - 1 = 18.;;
Response:  We know that Ed has 10 balls in his pocket and he needs to give 11 balls to Dolan. So, we need to subtract 11 from 10 which gives us  -1. Now, since Ed gave all of his balls to Dolan, there are no more balls left in Ed's pocket. Therefore, the number of balls left with Ed is 0 or -1.;;
Response:  Ed has 6 marbles and takes away 3 from him, so he now has 3 marbles left.  Then, Doug gives him 22 more marbles, so Ed now has a total of 25 marbles.;;
Response:  Ed has 5 marbles and gives 3 to Doug. So, Ed now has 5 - 3 = 2 marbles left. Doug had 0 marbles initially but received 3 from Ed, so Doug now has 3 marbles. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles that Ed had (27) and the number of marbles that Doug had (3) is 24.;;
Response:  We know that Ed has 24 balls and he gave 9 of them to Doug. So, Ed now has 15 balls left (24 - 9 = 15). Now we need to find out how many balls Doug has after receiving 27 balls from Ed. Therefore, Doug had 0 balls initially since he received all 27 balls from Ed. So, the final number of balls that Doug has is 27.  Therefore, the difference between the number of balls Ed had and the number of balls Doug had is:  Ed's initial balance - Doug's final balance = 15 - 27 = -12.;;
Response:  We know that Ed has 29 balls and he wants to give some of them to Doug. If we divide 29 by 3 (the number of times Ed wants to share with Doug), we get 9. So, Ed will have 9 balls left after sharing 3 times with Doug.;;
Response:  We know that Ed has 19 marbles and he gave 8 to Doug. So, we need to find out how many marbles are left with Ed after giving them to Doug.

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are taking part in the cooking activity. According to the question, there are 182 students participating in the activity. Next, we need to determine how much rice each student will get based on the number of students and the amount of rice needed for one person. Based on the information provided, each student needs 300 grams of rice, so we can calculate the total amount of rice needed as follows: Total amount of rice = Number of students x Amount of rice per student Total amount of rice = 182 students x 300 grams/student = 54,600 grams Of course, this is just an estimate since we don't know exactly how much each student will eat. Finally, we need to subtract the amount of rice used from the total amount of rice available to see how much dried fish each student will receive. Based on the calculation above, if 166 students take only their share of dried fish, then each student will receive (Total amount of rice - Used rice) / Number of students = (54,600 grams - 16,600 grams) / 182 students = 37.9 grams of dried fish per student.;;

"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of students who chose each food option. From the given information, there are 66 food options in total and 450 students participated in the survey. Therefore, the number of students who chose each food option is:

Number of students choosing each food option = Total number of students / Number of food options
= 450 / 66
= 6.77 (approximately)

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by all the students. According to the question, the total amount of rice consumed is equal to the sum of the amounts of rice consumed by each student multiplied by the number of students who chose that particular food option. Therefore, the total amount of rice consumed can be calculated as follows:

Total amount of rice consumed = Sum of amount of rice consumed by each student x Number of students who chose that particular food option

Now, let's find out how much rice was consumed by each student based on their choices. We know that there were 66 food options in total, and each student could choose up to 38 different types of food, including rice. Therefore, the maximum amount of rice that each student could consume is:

Maximum amount of rice consumed by each student = Number of food options x Choices made by each student
= 66 x 38
= 2592 (approximately)

Finally, we need to subtract the maximum amount of rice consumed by each student from the total amount of rice consumed to get the remaining amount of rice left over after everyone had eaten their fill. Therefore, the remaining amount of rice left over can be calculated as follows:

Remaining amount of rice left over = Total amount of rice consumed - Maximum amount of rice consumed by each student
= 6512 - 2592
= 3920 (approximately)

So, there are approximately 3920 grams of rice left over after everyone had eaten their fill.";;

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many boys are in class 7A and class 7B. According to the question, there are 732 boys in class 7A and 761 boys in class 7B. Therefore, the total number of boys in both classes is 732 + 761 = 1493 boys. Next, we need to find out how many girls are in class 7A and class 7B. According to the question, there are 682 girls in class 7A and 8 girls in class 7B. Therefore, the total number of girls in both classes is 682 + 8 = 690 girls. Now, let's calculate the percentage of boys and girls in each class. To do this, we divide the number of boys or girls in each class by the total number of students in that class. For example, to find out the percentage of boys in class 7A, we divide 732 (the number of boys in class 7A) by 1493 (the total number of students in both classes):  Percentage of boys in class 7A = (732 / 1493) x 100%  = 49.5% Similarly, to find out the percentage of girls in class 7B, we divide 682 (the number of girls in class 7B) by 1493 (the total number of students in both classes):  Percentage of girls in class 7B = (682 / 1493) x 100%  = 45.5% Finally, we can calculate the overall percentage of boys and girls in both classes by adding their percentages together: Overall percentage of boys and girls = (49.5% + 45.5%) x 100%  = 95% So, the overall percentage of boys and girls in both classes is 95%.;;

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:  Boys = 135 + 214 = 349 Students Total number of boys = 135 Number of girls = 214 Now, let's find out how many boys and girls are in each class. According to the question, there are 496 boys and 910 girls in the school. Therefore, the number of boys and girls in each class is: Classes with only boys: 496 / 349 = 1.4 (approximately) classes with only girls: 910 / 349 = 2.7 (approximately) So, there are approximately 1.4 classes with only boys and 2.7 classes with only girls in the school.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many boys are in class 308 and how many girls are in class 318. Then, we can calculate the total number of students in both classes. Finally, we can divide the total number of students by the number of teachers to get the ratio of students to teachers. Here is the calculation: Class 308 has 308 boys, so the number of boys is 308. Class 318 has 318 girls, so the number of girls is 318. The total number of students in both classes is 308 + 318 = 626. Therefore, the ratio of students to teachers is 626 / 36 = 17.5.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many boys are in class 3A and class 3L. According to the question, there are 315 boys in class 3A and 309 boys in class 3L. Therefore, the total number of boys in both classes is 315 + 309 = 624 boys. Now, let's calculate the number of girls in each class. According to the question, there are 772 girls in school, including 315 girls in class 3A and 457 girls in class 3L. So, the total number of girls in both classes is 457 + 315 = 772 girls. Finally, we can conclude that there are 624 boys and 772 girls in the school.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many boys are in class 402. According to the question, there are 402 boys in this class. Now, let's calculate the number of girls in class 402. We know that there are 739 girls in total and class 402 has 402 boys, so the number of girls in class 402 is equal to the number of boys minus the number of boys in class 402, which is 739 - 402 = 337 girls. Therefore, there are 337 girls in class 402.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are in class 458. According to the question, there are 458 students in this class. Next, we need to calculate the number of boys in the class. Based on the question, there are 307 boys in class 458.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 13 and he wants to give some money to his friend. We are also given that Edward's friend's name is Dewa. Now, let's calculate how much money Edward can give to his friend. According to the question, if Edward gives $ 3 to his friend Dewa, then he will be left with $ 10 ($ 13 - $ 3). So, the amount of money that Edward can give to his friend Dewa is $ 10. Therefore, the answer is $ 10.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 9 in his pocket and he spends $ 8 for lunch. So, he has $ 1 left after buying lunch. Then, he meets someone named Sepira who gives him $ 17 as a gift. Therefore, Edward now has $ 34 ($ 1 + $ 17) in his pocket.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has 16 books and he wants to sell them for $ 92. So, each book costs approximately $ 5.75 ( $ 92 / 16). Now, let's see how much money Edward will get if he sells all his books. He will get $ 6 per book, so he will get a total of $ 6 x 16 = $ 96. Therefore, Edward will have $ 96 left after selling all his books.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Edward has after he spends $6 on two books. So, Edward has $6 - $6 = $0 left. Now, he purchases another book for $12. Therefore, his new balance is $0 + $12 = $12.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 6 in his pocket and he spends $ 2 on a book. So, he now has $ 4 left in his pocket. Then, he spends another $ 10 on a pen, leaving him with $ 4 again. Finally, he spends $ 5 on a notebook, so he has $ 3 left ($ 4 - $ 5). Therefore, the final amount of money Edward has is $ 3.;;
Response:  We know that Edward has $ 4 in cash and $ 3 in pens. So, his total amount of money is $ 4 + $ 3 = $ 7. Now, we are asked how much Saiki owes to Edward. According to the question,Saiki owes $ 12 to Edward. Therefore, the difference between what Saiki owes and what Edward has is :$ 12 - $ 7 = $ 5.So, Saiki owes $ 5 to Edward.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 16 in cash and $ 8 in pens. So, altogether he has $ 24. Now, we are asked to find out how much money Saiki owes him. We know that Saiki gave $ 19 as a deposit for the book. Therefore, the amount of money Saiki owes Edward is $ 19 - $ 24 = -$5.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 17 and he spends $ 10 on bananas. So, his remaining money is $ 7. Now, let's calculate how much money Edward will have after buying the sandwiches.

Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups in class and David did 58 push-ups. So, if we subtract David's number of push-ups from Zachary's number, we get: 44 - 58 = -14. Therefore, Pira pushed up 14 more than David.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary can do 51 push-ups in one minute. Secondly, we are told that David can do 44 push-ups in one minute. Now, let's find out how many push-ups Zachary can do if he is doing them simultaneously with David. We need to divide the number of push-ups Zachary can do by the time it takes him to complete them (in this case, 60 seconds). So, Zachary can do 51/60 = 0.85 push-ups per second. Since David can also do 44 push-ups in 60 seconds, we can say that Zachary can do 0.85 x 44 = 37 push-ups simultaneously with David. Therefore, Zachary can do more push-ups than David.;;
Response:  David can do 44 push-ups in class because he is strong and fit. However, Zachary only did 9 push-ups, which means he is weaker than David. So, to find out how many push-ups Zachary would need to do to catch up with David, we divide 44 by 5 (the number of push-ups David did). This gives us an estimate of 8.8 push-ups that Zachary needs to do per day to catch up with David.;;
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups in class and Zachary did 49 push-ups. So, we can say that Zachary did fewer push-ups than David. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by David and Zachary is 2 (51 - 49).;;
Response:  We know that Zachary can do 59 push-ups in 44 seconds and has 27 less crunches than David. So, if we want to find out how many push-ups David can do, we need to subtract the number of crunches he does from the total number of push-ups Zachary did. Therefore, David can do 59 - (27 = 32) = 27 push-ups.;;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches in class today. David did 29 push-ups but only managed to do 13 crunches. So, if we subtract the number of crunches David did from the total number of crunches Zachary did, we get:  Crunches done by David = 13 (Zachary's crunches) - 17 (David's crunches) = -4 crunches. Therefore, David did 4 fewer crunches than Zachary.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary can do 53 push-ups and 14 crunches in class. Secondly, David can only do 17 push-ups which is less than half of Zachary's number. Lastly, we are asked to find out how many more push-ups Zachary can do compared to David. Therefore, the difference between their numbers is equal to the number of push-ups Zachary can do more than David. So, the answer is: 53 - 17 = 36 more push-ups done by Zachary compared to David.;;
Response:  We know that David did 58 push-ups and 87 crunches in class. If we subtract the number of push-ups Zachary did (35), then we get 23 push-ups left over. Since each push-up is worth 1 point, David earned 23 points for his push-ups. Now, let's calculate the number of crunches Zachary did minus the number of crunches David did (46 - 87 = -41). So, Zachary lost 41 points for his crunches. Therefore, the difference between the number of points Zachary lost and the number of points David gained is 23 + (-41) = 64 points.;;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 58 crunches and David did 62 crunches. So, if we subtract David's number of crunches from Zachary's number of crunches, we get: 58 - 62 = -4. Therefore, Zachary has 4 fewer crunches than David.;;
Response:  We know that Zachary can do 19 push-ups in class, and David did 39 more than Zachary. So, David can do 58 push-ups (39 + 19). Now, we are asked how many push-ups Pi...;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary can do 51 push-ups in class. Then, David can do 22 push-ups less than Zachary, which means he can do 29 push-ups (51 - 22 = 29). Now, we are told that John can do 4 fewer push-ups than David, which means he can do 25 push-ups (29 - 4 = 25). Therefore, John can do 25 push-ups.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary can do 15 push-ups in one set. Then, David did 39 push-ups more than Zachary. So, David can do 39 + 15 = 54 push-ups in one set. Now, John can do 9 less than David's number of push-ups, which is 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups in one set. Therefore, the answer to the question is 45.;;
Response:  David can do 30 push-ups in one minute, and Zachary can do 50 push-ups in one minute. So, if they are doing push-ups together for 1 minute and 45 seconds (or 90 seconds), then David will be able to do 30 x 90 = 2700 push-ups, while Zachary will be able to do 50 x 90 = 4500 push-ups. Therefore, David is able to do 2700 push-ups less than Zachary, which is 4500 - 2700 = 1800 push-ups.;;
Response:  David did 56 push-ups in total and then took a break for 10 minutes. After that, he resumed his exercise routine with Zachary, who could only do 38 push-ups. So, if we compare their performance during the same time frame (i.e., after the break), David was able to do 2 more push-ups than Zachary (56 - 38 = 18). Therefore, David is better at doing push-ups than Zachary by 18 push-ups.;;
Response:  We know that David did 40 push-ups and 17 crunches. Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. To find out how many more crunches Zachary did than David, we can subtract their number of crunches: 62 - 17 = 45. So, Zachary did 45 more crunches than David.;;
Response:  David did 36 push-ups and Zachary did 58 push-ups. If we subtract the number of push-ups that Zachary did from the number of push-ups that David did, we get: 36 - 58 = -22. So, Zachary did 22 more push-ups than David.;;
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and 7 less than his number of crunches. So, if he did 10 crunches fewer than his push-ups, then he did 17 crunches (since 10 is 7 more than 3). Now we need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since Zachary did 5 push-ups more than David, David did 5 + 5 = 10 push-ups fewer than Zachary. Therefore, David did 17 push-ups - 10 = 7 push-ups.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of questions in both sets. For set A, there are 5 questions in mathematics and 2 questions in Maca.

Response:  We know that Rachel has 5 tasks in mathematics and she needs to complete them within 1 hour. Each task takes her approximately 20 minutes to complete. So, we can calculate the total time needed for Rachel to complete all 5 tasks as follows: Time taken = Number of tasks x Time per task = 5 x 20/60 = 30 minutes Now, let's assume that Rachel completes 7 tasks instead of 5. To find out how much more time she will need to complete these additional 2 tasks, we can simply add the time required to complete each additional task to the previous calculation: Total time needed = 30 minutes + (Time per task x Number of additional tasks) = 30 minutes + (20/60 x 2) = 30 minutes + 40 seconds = 70 minutes and 40 seconds Therefore, if Rachel completes 7 tasks instead of 5, it will take her approximately 70 minutes and 40 seconds to complete all the tasks.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of tasks that Rachel has completed in mathematics, which is 4 (lembar tugas matematika luwih akeh).

Response:  Firstly, we know that Jack has 10 emails in his inbox and he wants to send 5 emails to different people. So, the total number of emails he can send is 10 - 5 = 5. Now, let's consider the second part of the question where he wants to know how many emails he can send without overwhelming the recipients. We assume that each person can handle an average of 2-3 emails per day, so the maximum number of emails Jack can send without overwhelming them is 5 / 2 = 2.5 emails per day. Therefore, the answer to the question is 2.5 emails per day.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many emails are in each of the three groups given in the question.  Group 1 has 6 emails, Group 2 has 3 emails and Group 3 has 10 emails.  Now, let's calculate the total number of emails that Jack receives from all the groups together.  The total number of emails received by Jack is 6 + 3 + 10 = 19 emails.  Therefore, Jack receives 19 emails in total.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many emails Jack received from different people. From the question, we know that there are 3 emails in total and they were sent by 64, 54, and 20 people respectively. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received is: 3 x 64 = 192. Now, let's calculate the number of times each person emailed Jack. We can see that the first person emailed Jack 64 times, the second person emailed him 54 times, and the third person emailed him 20 times. So, the total number of times all these people emailed Jack is: 64 + 54 + 20 = 138. Finally, we add the number of emails Jack received (192) with the number of times he was emailed (138), which gives us the total number of messages Jack received from all these people: 192 + 138 = 330. Therefore, the answer to the question is 330.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many emails are in each group. From the given information, there are 5 emails in Group A and 7 emails in Group B. Now, let's count the number of times each email appears in both groups. Email 'ik' appears once in Group A and twice in Group B, so its count is 1 + 2 = 3. Similarly, for other emails, their counts are as follows: 'esuk' - 0 + 1 = 1;wayah' - 0 + 2 = 2;ing' - 1 + 0 = 1, and'sore' - 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore, the total count of unique emails that appear in both groups is 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 7. So, the answer to the question is 7.

These are the most interesting emails for him to respond to.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many emails Jack has sent in total. According to the question, Jack has sent 3 emails to Wayah and 5 emails to Esuk. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack has sent is 3 + 5 = 8 emails. Now, let's calculate the number of emails Jack has sent to each person separately. To do this, we divide the total number of emails by the number of people he has sent them to. In this case, Jack has sent 8 emails to 2 people (Wayah and Esuk). So, the number of emails Jack has sent to each person is 8 / 2 = 4 emails per person.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many emails are in each of the three categories mentioned in the question.  Emails from Wayah Sore - 6 Emails from Esuk Lan - 5 Emails from Liyane Ingway - 4 Total number of emails = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 Now, we need to calculate the total number of unique emails that Jack receives. Unique emails received by Jack = Total number of emails x Number of times an email is sent to Jack (out of the total number of emails) Total number of times an email is sent to Jack = 15 x 2/3 = 5 So, Jack receives 5 unique emails in total.;;
Response:  Grasshopper (mlumpat) has an arm length of 9 inches and a leg length of 12 inches. To calculate the total body length, we need to add the arm length to the leg length. So, the total body length is 9 + 12 = 21 inches.;;
Response:  Grasshopper length = 31 inches + Kangaroo length = 35 inches = 66 inches. So, the total length of both is 66 inches.;;
Response:  Grasshopper length is 36 inches, and mouse length is 17 inches. The ratio of the length of the grasshopper to that of the mouse is 2:1 (or 36/17). Therefore, if we want to find out how many times longer the grasshopper is than the mouse, we can divide their lengths directly: 36 / 17 = 2.06 (approximately). So, the grasshopper is approximately 2.06 times longer than the mouse.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how long the grasshopper is. According to the question, the length of the grasshopper is 25 inches. Next, we need to find out how long the mouse is. The question states that the length of the mouse is 18 inches. Now, let's calculate the distance between the two animals using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Start Point - End Point. We are given that the speed of the mouse is 3 inches per second and the time it takes for the mouse to move from its starting point to the end point is 4 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse can be calculated as follows: Distance = (3 inches/second) x (4 seconds) + (starting point - ending point) = (3 inches/second) x 4 + (-18 inches) = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches. Since the grasshopper is longer than the mouse, the distance between them is greater than the distance traveled by the mouse. Therefore, the answer is 30 inches.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how long is one jump of a grasshopper and a mouse.  The length of one jump of a grasshopper is given as 19 inches (in). Therefore, the distance traveled by a grasshopper in one jump is 19 x 2 = 38 inches (in). Now, let's find out how far a mouse can jump. According to the question, a mouse jumps 10 times farther than a grasshopper. So, if a grasshopper jumps 38 in., then a mouse jumps 38 x 10 = 380 in. Next, we need to find out how far apart are two points that are directly above each other. If two points are directly above each other, their distance apart is equal to half the height of one point minus half the height of the other point. In this case, the height of a grasshopper is 19 in., and the height of a mouse is 20 in. Therefore, the distance between two points directly above each other is half (19 - 20) = -1 inch. Finally, we need to subtract the distance between the two points from the total distance traveled by the mouse to get the distance it takes for the mouse to reach the ground after jumping off from the top of the grasshopper. Thus, the distance the mouse falls after jumping off from the top of the grasshopper is 380 in. - (-1 in.) = 379 in. Therefore, the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse after the mouse has fallen to the ground is 379 in.;;
Response:  Grasshopper length is 19 inches, and cricket length is 39 inches shorter than the grasshopper. So, if we subtract 39 from 19, we get 10 inches (or 25 cm). Therefore, the length of the cricket is 10 inches or 25 cm less than the length of the grasshopper.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the grasshopper is 25 inches (incluiding the tail). Secondly, the length of the kangaroo is 32 inches long without its tail. Thirdly, the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the wall is 10 feet. Lastly, we need to find out how many times the height of the kangaroo can fit into the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the wall. Therefore, we divide the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the wall by the height of the kangaroo: Distance = 10 feet / 32 inches = 0.3125 feet or approximately 0.31 feet. So, the distance from the ground to the highest point of the wall is approximately 0.31 feet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the grasshopper is 24 inches and the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse is 10 inches (as stated in the question). Therefore, the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse is:  Distance = Grasshopper length - Mouse distance = 24 in - 10 in = 14 in Next, we are asked to find out how many times the length of the mouse can fit into the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse. To do this, we divide the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse by the length of the mouse:  Number of times mouse can fit = Distance / Mouse length = 14 in / 5 in = 2.8 times Now, since there are 2.8 times the length of the mouse between the grasshopper and the mouse, we can conclude that the distance between the grasshopper and the mouse is approximately 2.8 x 5 in = 14 in. So, the answer is 14 inches.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the length of the grasshopper is equal to the width of the plate. We can see from the picture that the length of the grasshopper is 13 inches and the width of the plate is 2 inches. Therefore, we have:

$$ \frac{length}{width} = 13:2 = 6 $$

So, there are $ 6 $ times when the length of the grasshopper is equal to the width of the plate. Now, let's count how many times the height of the grasshopper is equal to the thickness of the plate. From the picture, we can see that the height of the grasshopper is $ 13 $ inches and the thickness of the plate is $ 0.5 $ inches. Therefore, we have:

$$ \frac{height}{thickness} = 13:0.5 = 26 $$

So, there are $ 26 $ times when the height of the grasshopper is equal to the thickness of the plate. Finally, we need to multiply these two numbers to get the total number of times the grasshopper touches the plate:

$$ Total = 6 \times 26 = 156 $$

Therefore, the answer to the question is $ 156 $.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many inches are there in 1 foot. We know that 1 foot = 12 inches. So, if we have 35 inches of grasshopper, it means we have 35 / 12 = 3 feet of grasshopper. Now, let's calculate the length of 4 inches of grasshopper. Since 1 inch = 0.08333333 feet, we can calculate the length of 4 inches as follows: 4 inches x 0.08333333 = 0.3333333 feet. Therefore, the total length of the grasshopper is 3 feet + 0.3333333 feet = 3.3333333 feet.;;
Response:  Grasshopper length = 19 inches (in) = 48 cm (cm). Mouse length = 4 in (in) = 10 cm (cm). Rat length = 44 in (in) = 112 cm (cm). Now we need to find out how many times longer the rat is than the grasshopper and the mouse. Longer = (Rat length - Grasshopper length) / (Mouse length - Grasshopper length) So, Longer = (44 in - 19 in) / (4 in - 48 cm) = 7.5 To summarize, the rat is approximately 7.5 times longer than the grasshopper and the mouse.;;
Response:  We know that the length of the grasshopper is 39 inches and the length of the mouse is 12 inches. To find out how far the mouse can jump, we need to divide the length of its body by two. So, the distance the mouse can jump is 12 / 2 = 6 inches. Therefore, the answer is 6 inches.;;
Response:  Grasshopper length = 21 inches (mlumpat 21 inci). Mouse length = 16 inches (tikus mlumpat 16 inci). Ratio of grasshopper to mouse length =? To find out the ratio, we need to divide the length of the grasshopper by the length of the mouse. So, the ratio is: Grasshopper length / Mouse length = 21 inci / 16 inci = 1.31 (or approximately 1.31) Therefore, the height of the Javanese cat based on the given information is approximately 1.31 times the height of the mouse.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many meters of cloth are needed for each row of the blanket. We know that there are 39 inches in one meter, so:

$ \text {Length} = \frac{\text{Inches}}{\text{Meters}} $

So, the length of each row of the blanket is:

$$\boxed{L = \frac{39}{100} = 0.39 \text{ meters}} $$

Next, we need to calculate the total length of all the rows of the blanket:

$$\boxed{T = L \times n = 0.39 \text{ meters} \times 5 = 1.95 \text{ meters}} $$

Now, let's find out how much fabric is required for each row of the blanket:

$$\boxed{F = T / R = 1.95 \text{ meters} / 5 = 0.387 \text{ meters}} $$

Finally, we can calculate the amount of fabric required for the entire blanket:

$$\boxed{A = F \times n = 0.387 \text{ meters} \times 5 = 1.935 \text{ meters}} $$

Therefore, the amount of fabric required for making a blanket with 39 inches wide and 17 inches long is approximately 1.935 meters.";;
Response:  We know that the length of the grasshopper is 9 inches and the length of the mouse is 3 inches shorter than the length of the grasshopper. So, the length of the mouse is 9 - (3 =) 6 inches. Now we need to find out how many times longer the mouse is than the distance between two points on the ground. The distance between these two points is 33 inches long. Therefore, the number of times longer the mouse is than this distance can be calculated as follows:  Jarak sing diendhalèni tikus = Distance between two points / Length of mouse = 33 inches / 6 inches = 5.5 times longer.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the length of the grasshopper is 14 inches (in ci). Secondly, we know that the length of the mouse is 16 inches (in ci) and it is smaller than the grasshopper. Thirdly, we know that the length of the belalang is 37 inches (in ci) and it is longer than both the grasshopper and the mouse. Finally, we are asked to find out how far away from each other are the tikus and the belalang. So, let's calculate the distance between them using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Start Point - End Point Where speed represents the speed at which each animal moves, time represents the duration for which they move, start point represents the initial position of each animal, and end point represents their final position after moving. Now, let's analyze the given information carefully:  Grasshopper: The grasshopper moves at a speed of 2 inches per second (in/s). It takes 5 seconds to cover its entire length (14 in). Therefore, the distance covered by the grasshopper in one minute is: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 in/s x 5 s = 10 in. Mouse: The mouse also moves at a speed of 2 in/s. However, it takes only 3 seconds to cover its entire length (16 in). Therefore, the distance covered by the mouse in one minute is: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 in/s x 3 s = 6 in. Belalang: The belalang moves at a speed of 4 in/s. It takes 8 minutes to cover its entire length (37 in). Therefore, the distance covered by the belalang in one minute is: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 in/s x 8 min = 32 in. Tikus-Belalang Distance: Since the tikus and the belalang are not at the same starting point, we need to subtract the initial position of the tikus from the end point of the belalang to get the total distance between them. Let's assume that the tikus starts at a point X feet away from the belalang, where X is some real number. Then, the distance between the tikus and the belalang;;
Response:  We have 14 cups of glutinous rice and 6 cups of sugar. If we want to make 5 cups of sticky rice, how much will be left over after adding the sugar? So, the amount of glutinous rice that will be used is 14 - 5 = 9 cups. Therefore, there will be 9 / 6 = 1.5 cangkirs of glutinous rice leftover after adding the sugar.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many cups of rice are needed based on the given amount of glutinous rice. We know that 1 cup of glutinous rice is equivalent to 200 grams. Therefore, if we want to make 9 cups of glutinous rice, we need 9 x 200 grams = 1800 grams of glutinous rice. Now, let's check how much sugar is required for the dish. According to the question, 11 cups of sugar are needed, which means we need 11 x 250 grams = 2750 grams of sugar. Finally, we add the weight of the sugar and glutinous rice together to get the total weight of ingredients needed for the dish. So, the total weight of ingredients needed is 1800 grams + 2750 grams = 4550 grams.;;
Response:  We have 6 cups of glutinous rice and we need to make 8 cups of glutinous rice with sugar. So, how many cups of glutinous rice do we need in total?  We need 2 more cups of glutinous rice than what we already have. Therefore, the answer is 8 cups of glutinous rice.;;
Response:  We have 11 cups of rice and we want to know how much sugar is needed for each cup of rice. So, if we divide 11 cups of rice by 7 cups of sugar, we get 1.6 (or approximately 1 and 6/7) cups of sugar per cup of rice. Now, let's calculate the total amount of sugar needed for all 11 cups of rice. If we multiply 1.6 cups of sugar per cup of rice by 11 cups of rice, we get 17.6 cups of sugar (or approximately 17 and 6/7 cups). Therefore, the answer is 17.6 cups of sugar.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are needed for 11 bowls of soup. We know that each bowl of soup requires 2 cups of rice, so we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 cups of rice needed.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has 5 cups of glutinous rice and wants to make 14 cups of sweet soup. Then, she adds 10 cups of glutinous rice for extra sweetness. Therefore, the total amount of glutinous rice needed is: 5 + 10 = 15 cups.;;
Response:  We have 12 cups of glutinous rice and need to make 11 cups of sticky rice. So we will have 1 cup of unused glutinous rice (12 - 11 = 1).;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has 10 cups of rice and she wants to share it equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 2.5 cups of rice (10 / 4 = 2.5).  Then, we are given that there is an extra cup of rice left over after they have shared it equally. Therefore, the number of cups of rice left over is equal to the number of cups of rice that were initially available minus the number of cups of rice that were shared equally among the four people. In this case, the number of cups of rice left over is 10 - (2.5 x 4) = 10 - 10 = 0 cups of rice.  So, the final answer is 0 cups of rice.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many cups of rice are needed based on the amount given in the question:

Mary has 12 cups of glutinous rice (glapung). She also has 7 cups of uncooked rice (uyah). To make sure there is enough food for everyone, she decides to add an extra cup of uncooked rice (uyah) to the total amount of rice she has. So, the total amount of rice Mary has is:

12 cups of glutinous rice + 7 cups of uncooked rice = 19 cups of rice

Now, let's calculate how much water is needed to cook all these rice:

According to the recipe, 14 cups of water are needed to cook 19 cups of rice. Therefore, the ratio of water to rice is:

14 cups of water : 19 cups of rice = 0.73 cups of water per cup of rice

So, if Mary wants to cook all the rice with exactly 2 cups of water, she will need:

2 cups of water x 0.73 = 1.46 cups of water

Therefore, Mary needs 1.46 cups of water to cook all the rice she has.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are needed based on the given amount of glutinous rice and sticky rice. We know that 1 cup of glutinous rice is equal to 200 grams, so we need to convert the weight of glutinous rice from grams to cups. Therefore, we divide the weight of glutinous rice (800 grams) by its volume in grams per cup (200 grams/cup), which gives us 4 cups of glutinous rice. Next, we multiply the number of cups of glutinous rice by the number of cups of water required for every cup of glutinous rice, which is 3 cups of water according to the recipe. So, we get 12 cups of water (4 cups x 3 cups/cup). Now, let's move on to calculating the number of cups of sticky rice needed. Based on the recipe, we know that 1 cup of sticky rice requires 6 cups of water. Since we have already calculated 12 cups of water for the glutinous rice, we subtract 6 cups of water from 12 cups, which gives us 6 cups of water for the sticky rice. Finally, we divide the total weight of ingredients (800 grams + 600 grams = 1400 grams) by the number of cups of water needed for both types of rice, which gives us approximately 100 grams of sugar per cup of water. Therefore, if we want to make 5 cups of rice, we will need 5 x 100 grams = 500 grams of sugar.;;
Response:  We have 12 cups of rice and we need to add 2 cups of sugar. So, the total amount of sugar needed is 12 + 2 = 14 cups of sugar.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have 9 cups of rice and 6 cups of sugar. If we add 4 more cups of sugar, it means we will have 10 cups of sugar in total (9 + 6 = 15). So, the number of cups of rice that we need to mix with 10 cups of sugar is 1/2 or 5 cups (10 / 2 = 5). Therefore, the final amount of mixture needed is 5 cups of rice and 10 cups of sugar.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has 6 cups of sugar and needs to make 9 cups of glue. So far so good! However, she only has 2 cups of glue left after making the glue. To find out how much more glue she needs to make, we need to subtract the amount of glue she already has from the total amount of glue needed (9 - 2 = 7). Therefore, Mary needs an additional 7 cups of glue to complete her task.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of sugar are needed based on the recipe given. According to the recipe, for every 5 cups of rice, we need 1 cup of sugar. So, in this case, we need 5 x 1 = 5 cups of sugar. Next, we need to subtract the amount of sugar that was already used (11 cups) from the total amount needed (5 cups). Therefore, the remaining amount of sugar needed is 5 - 11 = -6 cups. Since it cannot be negative, the final answer is 0 cups of sugar needed.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are needed for 3 cups of sugar. We know that 1 cup of rice is equal to 200 grams, so... (3 cups x 200 grams/cup) = 600 grams of rice. Now, let's calculate how much water is needed to cook 600 grams of rice. According to the recipe, 1 cup of water is required for every 100 grams of rice, so... (600 grams / 100 grams per cup) = 6 cups of water. Therefore, the total amount of water needed to cook 600 grams of rice is 6 cups. Finally, we need to add the weight of the water to the weight of the rice to get the total weight of the dish. So... (600 grams + 6 cups x 100 grams/cup) = 900 grams.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are needed for 5 cups of sugar. We know that 1 cup of rice is equivalent to 0.4 cangkir (a unit of measurement in Indonesia), so:

5 cups of sugar x 0.4 cangkir/cup = 2 cangkir of rice

Next, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are left after cooking 13 cups of glutinous rice. We know that 1 cup of glutinous rice is equivalent to 0.6 cangkir (a unit of measurement in Indonesia), so:

13 cups of glutinous rice x 0.6 cangkir/cup = 8 cangkir of rice

Now, let's subtract the number of cups of rice used from the total number of cups of rice needed:

2 cangkir - 8 cangkir = -6 cangkir

Therefore, there are -6 cangkir of rice left after cooking 13 cups of glutinous rice using 5 cups of sugar.";;

Then, we add 15 cups of yogurt to the mixture, so the total amount of yogurt is 28 cups (15 + 13). Finally, we subtract 6 cups of milk from the total amount of yogurt, leaving us with 22 cups of yogurt (28 - 6). Therefore, the number of cups of yogurt that are left after adding all the ingredients is 22 cups.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of glutinous rice are needed for making 9 cups of sticky rice. We know that 1 cup of glutinous rice is equivalent to 250 grams, so we multiply 9 cups by 250 grams per cup to get the total weight of glutinous rice needed: 9 x 250 = 2250 grams. Now, let's check if we have enough glutinous rice to make 9 cups of sticky rice based on what Mary has provided: 14 cups of pounded glutinous rice (which is equal to 3500 grams) and 40 cups of uncooked glutinous rice (which is equal to 1000 grams). Based on these amounts, we can see that we actually have more than enough glutinous rice to make all 9 cups of sticky rice! So, the answer is 9 cups of sticky rice can be made using the given amount of glutinous rice.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of rice and chicken that Mary has. The total amount of rice is 9 cups + 7 cups = 16 cups. The total amount of chicken is 4 pieces x 0.5 kg/piece = 2 kg. Now, let's calculate the remaining amount of chicken after Dewa eats 2 pieces. So, the remaining amount of chicken is 2 kg - 2 pieces = 1.5 kg. Finally, let's add the weight of the rice and chicken together to get the total weight of the food that Mary has, which is 16 cups + 1.5 kg = 17.5 kg.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of rice and glutinous rice that Mary has. Based on the information given in the question, Mary has 11 cups of glutinous rice and 6 cups of regular rice. Therefore, the total amount of rice Mary has is:

Rice = 11 cups x 200 grams/cup = 2200 grams
Glutinous rice = 6 cups x 250 grams/cup = 1500 grams

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of sugar that Mary needs to add to the glutinous rice. According to the question, Mary wants to make 12 cups of glutinous rice, but she only has 11 cups of glutinous rice available. Therefore, she needs to add an additional cup of glutinous rice to her existing supply. The weight of one cup of glutinous rice is:

Weight of glutinous rice = 250 grams/cup
Therefore, the total weight of sugar that Mary needs to add to her glutinous rice is:

Sugar needed = 12 cups x 250 grams/cup = 3000 grams

Finally, we need to calculate the total weight of all the ingredients that Mary has, including both rice and sugar. This includes:

Total weight of ingredients = Weight of rice + Weight of sugar
= 2200 grams + 3000 grams
= 5200 grams

So, the answer to the question is 5200 grams.";;
Response:  Firstly, we have 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of glutinous rice. If we add 4 more cups of sugar, then the total amount of sugar will be 7 + 4 = 11 cups. So, the number of cups of glutinous rice that need to be added is 10 - 11 = -1 cup. Therefore, there is no need to add any more glutinous rice as there are already too many cups of it.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many cups of rice are needed based on the amount of sugar required. According to the question, 12 cups of sugar are needed and 1 cup of sugar is equivalent to 8 oz or 227 grams. Therefore, we need:

$$ Number \ of \ cups \ of \ rice = \frac{Amount \ of \ sugar}{Weight \ of \ one \ cup \ of \ rice} $$

Now, let's find out the weight of one cup of cooked rice. According to the recipe, it takes 14 cups of uncooked rice to make 12 cups of cooked rice, so:

$$ Weight \ of \ one \ cup \ of \ cooked \ rice = \frac{Weight \ of \ uncooked \ rice}{Conversion \ factor} $$

where $Weight \ of \ uncooked \ rice$ is equal to $14 \times 8 oz = 112 oz$ (since there are 8 oz in 1 cup) and $\text {Conversion } \ factor$ is equal to $1 cup = 8 oz$.

Therefore, we have:

$$ Number \ of \ cups \ of \ rice = \frac{12 \times 8 oz}{112 oz} = 10 \cup$$

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 49 households in the village located near the mountain. Then, we find out that 59 of these households have their livestock grazing in the area around the mountain. Finally, we learn that 24 of these households have their animals grazing in the area where the mountain meets the Arctic Ocean. So, to calculate the number of households whose animals are grazing in the area where the mountain meets the Arctic Ocean, we need to subtract the number of households whose animals are grazing in the other areas from the total number of households. Therefore, the answer is 24 - 59 = -35 households.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 27 groups of people who have been affected by the earthquake and they are currently living in temporary shelters near Mount Cedhak. Now, we need to find out how many people are left behind in their homes in the mountainous area. To do this, we can use the information that there are 41 groups of people who live in the mountainous area and they have a total of 300 houses. So, the number of people left behind in their homes is:  Number of groups of people living in the mountainous area = 41  Total number of houses in the mountainous area = 300 People left behind in their homes = Total number of groups of people living in the mountainous area x Total number of houses in the mountainous area / Number of groups of people affected by the earthquake (27) = 41 x 300 / 27 = 165 people.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 groups of people who want to migrate to another country. Each group has 26 members. Therefore, the total number of people who want to migrate is 26 x 3 = 78. Now, let's calculate the probability of each person in the first group being able to migrate. There are 26 members in this group, and they want to go to a country located near the North Pole. So, the probability of a member from this group being able to migrate is 1/4 (or 25%). Next, let's calculate the probability of each person in the second group being able to migrate. This group consists of 26 members as well, and they want to go to a country located far away from the North Pole. The probability of a member from this group being able to migrate is therefore 3/4 (or 75%). Finally, let's calculate the probability of each person in the third group being able to migrate. This group consists of only 2 members, so the probability of either of them being able to migrate is 100%. In conclusion, the total probability of all 78 people being able to migrate is the product of the probabilities for each group:  (1/4) x (3/4) x (100%) = 25%.;;

Response:  Ana has served 3 customers in 20 minutes, so she can serve one customer every 10 minutes (20/3 = 6.67).  Sakwise serves 4 customers in 30 minutes, so he can serve one customer every 7.5 minutes (30/4 = 7.5).  Now, let's compare their serving rates: 6.67 < 7.5, so Sakwise can serve more customers than Ana in the same time period. Therefore, the correct answer is B - Sakwise.;;
"Response:  Sak wise 9 pelanggan lunga dheweke means that there are 9 long-time customers who have been loyal to the company for a certain period of time (dheweke). Isih duweke means ""to calculate"" or ""to count"". So, we need to calculate how many customers have been loyal to the company for more than 1 year. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of customers = Total number of customers x Percentage of long-time customers. In this case, the total number of customers is 12, and the percentage of long-time customers is 9/12 = 0.75. Therefore, the number of customers who have been loyal to the company for more than 1 year is: Number of customers = 12 x 0.75 = 9. So, out of the 12 customers, 9 have been loyal to the company for more than 1 year.";;
Response:  Ana has served 14 customers in total. If 5 of them are already satisfied with her service, then there are 9 remaining customers who have not yet received service from her (since she only serves one customer at a time). So, the number of customers that Piraya will serve is 9.;;
Response:  Ana has served 13 customers in total. She has given priority to 4 of them who are waiting for a long time. So, she has served 4 x 13 = 52 customers altogether.

To do this, we can use the information provided in the question. The number of books Paul had initially is equal to the number of books he gave away minus the number of books he received. In this case, the number of books Paul gave away is 105, and the number of books he received is 0 (since he didn't receive any books). Therefore, the number of books Paul had initially is:  Books Initially = Number of Books Given Away - Number of Books Received  = 105 - 0  = 105 books.;;
Response:  We know that there are 108 books in total and we have to find out how many books Paul has read. From the question, we learn that Paul has read 35 of those books. So, the number of books left for Paul to read is: 108 - 35 = 73 books.;;
"Response:  We are given that Paul has 50 books and he wants to know how many of them can fit in his car. The length of the car is 151 meters. To find out how many books can fit in the car, we need to divide the length of the car by the length of each book. So, if each book is approximately 30 cm long (which is a rough estimate), then the number of books that can fit in the car is:

Number of books = Length of car / Length of each book
= 151 m / 30 cm
= 506 books
Therefore, Paul can fit 506 books in his car.";;

We know that the number of shelves required is equal to the total number of books divided by the capacity of each shelf. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Shelves = Total Books / Capacity of Each Shelf
In this case, the total number of books is 21, and the capacity of each shelf is 7. So, we can substitute these values into the equation: Number of Shelves = 21 / 7
Simplifying the fraction, we get: Number of Shelves = 3
Therefore, Paul needs 3 shelves to accommodate all his 21 books.";;
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Paul has 71 books. Then, we are told that he gave away 38 of them to his daughter during her birthday celebration. Now, let's calculate how many books Paul has left after giving away 38 books. We can do this by subtracting the number of books he gave away from the total number of books he had initially.

Therefore, the number of books Paul will have after giving away 68 books is:  Number of books = Total number of books - Number of books given away = 95 - 68 = 27 books;;
Response:  We know that Paul has 95 books and he gave 153 books to his friend. So, the number of books left with him is: 95 - 153 = -58 books. Now, we are asked how many books Paul has after giving 13 books and 23 pens to his friend. So, the number of books left with him is: -58 + 13 = -45 books. Therefore, the answer is -45 books.;;
Response:  We are given that Paulus has 42 books and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of books. Since there are 143 friends in total, we can calculate the number of books each friend will get as follows: Number of books per friend = Total number of books / Number of friends = 42/143 = 0.30 (or 30) So, Paulus will give 30 books to each of his 143 friends. Now, let's find out how many books Paulus himself will keep after giving away all the books. Number of books left with Paulus = Total number of books - Number of books given away = 42 - (30 x 143) = 42 - 4290 = -3870 Books Therefore, Paulus will keep -3870 books for himself.;;

Response:  Firstly, we know that Ana has 16 marigolds in her basket and she gives 4 of them to Jessica. So, now Ana has 16 - 4 = 12 marigolds left in her basket. Then, Jessica takes 3 more marigolds from Ana's basket, so now Ana has 12 - 3 = 9 marigolds left in her basket. Finally, Saiki takes 2 marigolds from Ana's basket, leaving Ana with 9 - 2 = 7 marigolds remaining in her basket. Therefore, the number of marigolds that Pirawan took from Ana is 7.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. The date of the first event is ""Sunday, January 10, 2021"" and the second event is ""Friday, March 5, 2021"". Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:

Days = Date of Second Event - Date of First Event
= Friday, March 5, 2021 - Sunday, January 10, 2021
= 46 days

Now, based on the information provided in the question, we know that Jessica was pregnant for 9 months. Since the due date of her baby is after the last day of the second event (March 5, 2021), we can assume that she gave birth on or around April 7, 2021 (which is 9 months after March 5, 2021).

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Pirang mawar sing dipotong?"" is:

Ana 23 mawar ing vas. Pirang mawar sing dipotong!";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between Ana and Jessica. According to the question, Ana is 15 years old now, and Jessica is 33 years old. So, the difference in their ages is 18 years (33 - 15). Now, we need to convert this age difference into days. There are 365 days in a year, so we can calculate the number of days between Ana and Jessica as follows:  Days = Age difference x Number of days in a year  Days = 18 years x 365 days/year  Days = 6495 days  Therefore, there are approximately 6495 days between Ana and Jessica.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between Ana and Jessica. According to the question, Ana is 21 years old now, and Jessica is 34 years old. So, the difference in their ages is 34 - 21 = 13 years. Now, we know that Jessica was born 15 years ago. Therefore, the difference between Jessica's age now and her birthday is 15 - (now - 15) = 10 years. Finally, we can calculate the number of days between Ana and Jessica as follows: Days between Ana and Jessica = (Now - Birthday) / (Age at Birthday - Age Now) x 365 Where ""Now"" represents Ana's current age, which is 21 years old. ""Birthday"" represents Jessica's birthday, which is 15 years ago. ""Age at Birthday"" represents Jessica's age at the time of her birthday, which is 13 years old. And ""Age Now"" represents Ana's age now, which is also 21 years old. Substituting these values into the formula above, we get: Days between Ana and Jessica = (21 - 15) / (13 - 21) x 365 ≈ 879 days. Therefore, the answer to the question is approximately 879 days.";;
Response:  We have 7 marigolds in Vas's basket and she has taken out 20 of them. So, there are 59 marigolds left in the basket. To find out how many marigolds Pirang took, we need to subtract the number of marigolds that Vas took from the total number of marigolds in the basket. Therefore, the answer is: 59 - 20 = 39;;
Response:  We know that there are 13 marrows in Vas's basket and Jessica has taken 2 of them. So, the number of marrows left with Vas is 13 - 2 = 11. Now, we need to find out how many marrows are in Vas's basket if there are 21 marrows in total. Therefore, the ratio of marrows in Vas's basket to the total number of marrows is 11/21 = 5/10.;;
Response:  We know that Ana has 15 marigolds and 62 orchids in her garden. Jessica has 17 marigolds and 96 orchids in her garden. To find out how many orchids Pirang has, we need to subtract the number of marigolds from the total number of flowers in both gardens. So, the answer is:  Orchids = Total Flowers - Marigolds;;
Response:  We have 12 marigolds and 2 orchids in Vas' garden. Then, we have 10 more marigolds added to the total number of marigolds, making it 22 marigolds in total. Now, let's calculate the number of orchids remaining after adding 10 more marigolds. The original number of orchids was 2, so if we add 10 more marigolds, there will be 2 orchids left. Therefore, the final answer is 22 marigolds and 2 orchids in Vas' garden.;;
Response:  We know that Ana has 5 marigolds and 3 orchids in her garden. Jessica also has 3 marigolds and 2 orchids in her garden. So, the total number of marigolds is 5 + 3 = 8. The total number of orchids is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, there are 8 marigolds and 5 orchids in both gardens combined.;;
Response:  We know that there are 7 marigolds and 12 orchids in Vas' garden. So, the total number of flowers is 7 + 12 = 19. Now, we are asked how many more orchids are there than marigolds. Therefore, the difference between the number of orchids (20) and the number of marigolds (19) is 1. So, the answer is 1.;;
Response:  We have 19 marigolds in total and we want to know how many are left after cutting off 3 of them. So, if we cut off 3 marigolds, there will be 16 marigolds left (19 - 3 = 16).;;

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 9 marigolds and 6 orchids in Vas' garden. Then, Jessica has 3 marigolds and 13 orchids in her own garden. So, if we subtract the number of marigolds that Jessica has from the total number of marigolds in Vas' garden, we get: Number of marigolds left = Total number of marigolds in Vas' garden - Number of marigolds owned by Jessica = 9 - 3 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 marigolds left in Vas' garden after Jessica took some of them.;;
Response:  We have to find out how many inches of hair are needed for each row and then add them up to get the total length of the hairstyle.  The number of rows required will depend on the length of the hair and the desired thickness of the braids.  For this example, let's assume that we want to make 4 rows of braids with each row having 3 inches of hair.  So, we need 4 x 3 = 12 inches of hair for all four rows combined.  Now, if we subtract the length of the bangs (which is 17 inches), we are left with 12 - 17 = -5 inches.  Therefore, there are -5 inches of hair remaining after making the braids.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total length of all the hairs that are tangled with each other. In this case, there are 20 inches of hair that are entangled together. Next, we need to find out how many inches of hair are left after cutting off the tangled part. Based on the question, we can see that 10 inches of hair were cut off from the tangled part. Therefore, the remaining length of hair is 20 - 10 = 10 inches. So, the final answer is 10 inches.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to convert all measurements from inches to centimeters. So, 16 inches is equal to 40 cm (since there are 2.54 cm in an inch). Next, we can convert 11 inches to centimeters, which is equal to 28 cm. Finally, we can convert 12 inches to centimeters, which is equal to 30 cm. Now, let's calculate the total length of Robin's hair:  Length of Robin's hair = 40 cm + 28 cm + 30 cm = 98 cm. Therefore, the length of Robin's hair is approximately 98 cm.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many inches are there in total length of Robin's hair. According to the question, the total length of Robin's hair is 19 inches. Now, let's find out how many inches are there in each strand of her hair. According to the question, each strand of her hair is 18 inches long. Therefore, the number of strands of Robin's hair = Total length of her hair / Length of each strand of her hair = 19 inches / 18 inches = 10.56 strands (round off to 11 strands). So, there are approximately 11 strands of Robin's hair for every inch of her head.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many inches are there in 13 inches. So, 13 inches = 13 x 0.083 (conversion factor). Now, we have to find out how many inches are there in 14 inches. So, 14 inches = 14 x 0.083 (conversion factor). Finally, we have to subtract the number of inches in 13 inches from the number of inches in 14 inches. Therefore, the difference between 13 and 14 inches is: 14 - 13 = 0.5 inches.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to convert all measurements from inches to centimeters. So, 14 inches is equal to 35.56 cm (since there are 2.54 cm in an inch). Next, we need to convert 8 inches to centimeters, which is equal to 20.32 cm. Finally, we need to convert 20 inches to centimeters, which is equal to 50.8 cm. Now, let's calculate the total length of the bird using these conversions: Total length = 35.56 + 20.32 + 50.8 = 106.68 cm Therefore, the length of the bird is approximately 106.68 cm.;;

Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has 53 bottles of water in his collection (30 new bottles + 23 old bottles). Then, he gives 17 bottles to his friend (42 - 17 = 25 remaining bottles). So, the number of bottles left with Danny is 25.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 22 bottles and 8 boxes of water in his backpack. If he gives each person in the park 1 bottle and 1 box, then how many people will he be able to give water to?  There are 28 bottles left after giving water to all the people in the park. So, if we divide 28 by 6 (the number of people he can give water to), we get 4.67. Therefore, Danny will be able to give water to approximately 4.67 people with the remaining amount of water in his backpack.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 22 bottles and 30 boxes of water in his garden. So, he has a total of 62 bottles and boxes (22 x 30 = 620). Now, we are asked how many bottles and boxes Danny has after giving some to his friends. From the problem statement, we know that Danny gave 17 bottles and 57 boxes to his friends. Therefore, the number of bottles and boxes left with Danny is:  Number of bottles left with Danny = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles given away = 620 - 17 = 583 bottles Number of boxes left with Danny = Total number of boxes - Number of boxes given away = 620 - 57 = 563 boxes;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 30 bottles and 14 boxes in his garden. If he wants to put them all together, he will need 7 more bottles and 86 more boxes. So, the total number of bottles is 30 + 7 = 37, and the total number of boxes is 14 + 86 = 100. Therefore, the number of bottles that Danny can fit inside each box is 37 / 100 = 0.37 bottles per box.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 11 bottles and 28 packages of water in his garden. If we multiply these numbers together, we get 308 (11 x 28). Now, let's find out how many bottles and packages of water Saiki has collected. According to the question, Saiki has collected 68 bottles and 51 packages of water. When we multiply these numbers together, we get 3490 (68 x 51). Therefore, the difference between the number of bottles and packages of water collected by Danny and Saiki is 3490 - 308 = 3182.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 71 bottles and 24 boxes of juice in his garden. He gives 28 bottles and 16 boxes to his friend. So, we can calculate the number of bottles left with Danny as follows: Number of bottles left with Danny = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles given to friend = 71 - 28 = 43 bottles. Therefore, Danny has 43 bottles left in his garden.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 10 bottles and 62 packages in his garden. So, he has a total of 72 bottles and packages (10 x 62 = 620). Now, we are asked how many bottles and packages Danny has if he gives 27 bottles and 43 packages to someone else. Therefore, the number of bottles Danny gave away is 27 / 10 = 2.7 bottles. Similarly, the number of packages Danny gave away is 43 / 62 = 0.7 packages. So, Danny has 69 bottles and 55 packages left in his garden (62 - 2 = 60, 62 - 0.7 = 55).;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 30 bottles in his collection and he wants to distribute them equally among 66 people in the park. So, each person will get 66/30 = 2.17 bottles from Danny.

Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of bottles in Danny's garden which is given as 32 bottles. Then, we need to subtract the number of empty bottles from the total number of bottles to get the number of full bottles. According to the question, there are 25 full bottles in the collection. Therefore, the final answer is: Number of full bottles = Total number of bottles - Empty bottles = 32 - 0 = 32 full bottles.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 32 bottles of water in his backpack. If he gives 10 bottles to Dewey, then Danny will have 22 bottles left (32 - 10 = 22). Now we know that Dewey has 60 bottles of water in total (60 botol lawas ing taman nalika dheweke nemokake), and he gave 58 bottles to Danny (58 tutup botol sing anyar). So, Dewey has 2 bottles of water left (60 - 58 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has filled 12 bottles (ngumpulake) in his bag (tutup botol). Then, he met someone who gave him 6 extra bottles (lawas) to fill in the park (taman). So, the total number of bottles Danny has now is 12 + 6 = 18 bottles. Next, we are told that there were 50 empty bottles (nemokake) left in the park after Danny had filled some of them with water from the well (duwé). Therefore, the total number of bottles available for filling in the park is 50 - 18 = 32 bottles. Finally, we are asked how many bottles Danny can fill if he wants to fill all the available bottles in the park. Since Danny already filled 18 bottles and there are still 32 bottles available, Danny can fill 32 - 18 = 14 additional bottles. So, the answer is 14 bottles.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny has filled up 30 bottles in his garden (tutup botol). Then, he has left 14 empty bottles (nemokake) after filling them all up. Next, we are told that there are 54 full bottles (lawas) in the collection (taman nalika dheweke). Finally, we see that Danny has taken 48 of those full bottles from the collection to fill up his garden again (sing anyar). So, the number of bottles remaining in the collection after Danny took some is equal to the total number of bottles he took minus the number of bottles he already had in his garden before taking more (pira maneh tutup botol sing dibuwang Danny tinimbang sing ditemokake ing taman kasebut). Therefore, the answer is 52 - 30 = 22 bottles.;;

Response:  We know that Danny has 66 bottles and he wants to pack them in boxes of 39 each. So, he will have 66 / 39 = 1.72 boxes left over after packing all the bottles. Now, we are told that there are 16 boxes with 68 bottles in total. Therefore, the number of boxes left over is 16 - 1.72 = 14.28 boxes.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 46 bottles and 50 caps in his garden. If he wants to put all of them together, how many combinations can he make with those numbers? There are 50 ways to arrange the caps (since there are 50 caps), and for each combination, we need to choose which bottle to use from the remaining 46 bottles. Therefore, the number of combinations is:  Combinations = Number of ways to arrange the caps x Number of ways to choose a bottle = 50 x 46 = 2300. So, Danny can make 2300 combinations with the bottles and caps he has.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has packed 65 bottles and put them in a box. Then he took out 31 bottles from the box and gave them to someone else. So, the number of bottles left with Danny is 65 - 31 = 34 bottles.;;
Response:  We know that Danny has 58 bottles and 25 boxes of fruit in his garden. He gives 11 boxes and 12 bottles to Saiki.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Steven has 18 persimmons and he wants to share them equally among his friends. So, if he shares them with Jake, Jake will get 18/2 = 9 persimmons. Now, let's consider Jill. She already has 5 persimmons of her own, so she doesn't need any from Steven. Therefore, the total number of persimmons Jake gets is 9 + (5 - 3) = 14 persimmons.;;
Response:  We know that Jake has 5 less persimmons than Steven. So, if Steven has x persimmons, then Jake has x - 5 persimmons.  Now, we are told that Jill has 18 more persimmons than Steven. So, if Steven has x persimmons, then Jill has x + 18 persimmons.  Finally, we are asked how many persimmons Jill has after Jake takes some from her. Well, if Jake takes y persimmons from Jill, then she will have x + 18 - y persimmons left.  Putting it all together, we get:  x + 18 = 87  Solving for x, we find that Jill had 69 persimmons originally (x = 69). Then, when Jake took 24 persimmons from her (y = 24), she was left with 45 persimmons (x + 18 - y = 45).;;
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 persimmons and wants to share them equally among his friends. If he gives 4 persimmons to each of his 4 friends, then how many persimmons will each friend get?

Jake has 8 apples and gives 4 to Steven. So, Jake now has 8 - 4 = 4 apples left. 
Steven initially had 10 apples and received 11 from Jake. So, Steven now has 10 + 11 = 21 apples in total.  Therefore, there are 21 - 4 = 17 apples left after Jake gave some to Steven.";;
"Response: 
Jake has 3 apples and 4 pears. So, in total, he has 3 + 4 = 7 fruits. 
Steven has 19 apples and 15 pears. In total, he has 19 + 15 = 34 fruits.  Therefore, there are 34 - 7 = 27 more fruits with Steven than with Jake.";;
Response:  Ana has $78 in her purse and spends $15 at the supermarket. So, she has $63 left ($78 - $15).;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket. Then, she paid $33 for the taxi ride. Therefore, the total amount of money Olivia spent is $78 + $33 = $111.;;
"Response: 
Ana has $100 in her wallet and withdraws $148 from an ATM. She then spends $159 at a supermarket. So, how much money does Ana have left after making these transactions?
Let's break it down:
Ana starts with $100 + $148 = $248.
She spends $159 at the supermarket, so now she has: $248 - $159 = $99.
Therefore, Ana has $99 left after making these transactions.";;
"Response: 
1. Ana has $3 in her purse and withdraws $49 from the ATM. 2. She spends $49 at the supermarket.  To find out how much money she has left after buying things at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($49) from the amount she had before buying ( $49 + $3 = $52). So, Ana has $52 left after buying things at the supermarket.";;
Response:  Ana has $53 in her wallet and withdraws $91 from the ATM. She spends $14 at the supermarket. To find out how much money Piri has left after buying things at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($14) from the total amount of money she had before buying anything ($91). So, the answer is:  $91 - $14 = $77;;
Response:  We know that Ana spent $106 in her purse and gave $26 to Olivia. So, the remaining amount of money left with Ana is $70 ( $106 - $26). Now, we are told that there was a sale at the supermarket where everything was 49% off. So, if Ana had bought something worth $70 before the sale, after the sale she would have paid $35.30 ( $70 x 49%). Therefore, the amount of money that Ana saved after buying something from the supermarket is $35.30 ($70 - $35.30).;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Sakwisé has in his wallet. He said he had $29 in his wallet initially. Then, he spent $54 at the supermarket. So, the amount of money he has left in his wallet after spending that amount is: $29 - $54 = -$25. Therefore, the correct answer is -$25.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that $38 is spent in the supermarket. Then, we are asked to find out how much money is left after buying some things from the store. So, let's assume that $128 is the total amount of money left after buying those things. Now, we need to calculate what percentage of the remaining money was spent in the supermarket. To do this, we can use the formula: Percentage = (Amount spent in supermarket / Total amount of money left) x 100%. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Percentage = ($38 / $128) x 100% = 30%. Therefore, 30% of the remaining money was spent in the supermarket.;;
Response:  We know that there are 19 applications available for HP devices and Dave wants to download 5 of them. So, we need to find out how many applications he can download from his phone. To do this, we divide 19 by 5, which gives us 3.8. Therefore, Dave can download 3 applications from his phone.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between 18th December and 5th January. There are 23 days in total. Now, let's calculate the number of times the application can be used during this period. Since the application is available for 5 days only, the number of times it can be used is 23 - 5 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.;;
Response:  We have 10 applications installed on an HP computer and we want to add 11 new ones. Of these 11 new applications, 4 are already installed on the computer. So, the total number of applications that will be installed after adding the new ones is: 10 + 11 - 4 = 17. Therefore, 3 applications (the 4 that were already installed) will be deleted.;;
Response:  We have 30 applications (Dave has 21 and he added 8 more). If we add 24 to that number, we get 55. So, the total number of applications after adding the new ones is 55.;;
Response:  We know that Dave has 15 applications in his HP and he added 71 new applications. So, the total number of applications now with Dave is 86 (15 + 71). Now, we are asked how many applications Piraya can use after adding the new ones. Since Piraya can use only 14 applications at a time, the remaining applications will be left unused or idle. Therefore, the correct answer is 10 (86 - 14 = 10).;;
Response:  Aplikasi Lan 16 has 77 files and Sakwisé Mbusak Sawetara has 5 applications with 23 files. So, if we subtract the number of files in Aplikasi Lan 16 from the total number of files in Sakwisé Mbusak Sawetara, we get:  Number of files in Sakwisé Mbusak Sawetara minus Number of files in Aplikasi Lan 16 = 23 - 77 = -54 files. Therefore, Pira aplikasi that was deleted is Sakwisé Mbusak Sawetara.;;
"Response:  We know that there are 17 applications and 21 files in total. Out of these, 3 applications and 7 files were selected for deletion. So, we need to find out how many files got deleted. To do this, we can use basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.
Let's first calculate the number of files that got deleted:
Number of files deleted = Number of selected files - Number of remaining files
= 7 - (21 - 3)
= 7 - 18
= -11
So, 11 files got deleted.";;
Response:  Aplikasi Lan 15 has 24 files in total, and Sakwisé Mbusak Sawetara has 21 applications with 4 files each. Therefore, the number of applications that Pira can download to his phone is:  Number of applications = Total number of applications - Applications available for download = 24 - (21 x 4) = 9 applications.;;
"Response:  We know that there are 19 applications and 18 files in HP.  Sakwisé means ""to count"" or ""to calculate"". So, we need to count how many files are associated with each application.  For example, if one application has 3 files associated with it, then the answer would be 3. Similarly, if another application has 7 files associated with it, then the answer would be 7. Therefore, the total number of files associated with all 6 applications is 6 x 7 = 42 files. Now, let's check which application has the most files associated with it. If Application A has 7 files associated with it, then it has more files than any other application. Therefore, the answer is 7.";;
Response:  We know that there are 17 applications installed on HP and we want to add another application. So, the total number of applications after adding one more will be 18 (17 + 1). Therefore, the answer is 18.;;
Response:  We have 59 files in total and we want to know how many of them are applications that can be installed on a cellphone. So, let's divide 59 by 15 which gives us 4 (round off). Therefore, out of 59 files, 4 are applications that can be installed on a cellphone. Now, we need to find out how many files are associated with each application. There are 12 applications and each application has an average of 30 files associated with it. So, the total number of files associated with all the applications is 12 x 30 = 360 files. Since some of these files may be duplicates or unnecessary, we will round off the total number of files to 300. Therefore, out of 59 files, 4 are applications that can be installed on a cellphone and there are approximately 300 files associated with those applications.;;
Response:  We know that Dave has 24 files in his HP laptop and he wants to transfer them to his new computer with Windows 10 operating system. He also has 17 applications installed on his old computer and he wants to transfer those too. However, when he connects his old computer to his new one using a USB drive, he finds out that some of the files are missing. Specifically, 9 files are no longer present among the 24 files he had originally. So, the answer is 9.;;
Response:  We have 24 applications and 9 files in total. If we want to transfer 5 files and 12 applications simultaneously over Bluetooth using HP-e, then we need to use at least 3 Bluetooth connections. Therefore, the answer is 3 x (5 + 12) = 36.;;
Response:  We have 11 applications and 3 files in total. If we divide it by 24 (the number of hours in a day), we get approximately 0.45 applications per hour. So, roughly one application every 2 hours. As for the files, since there are 2 files that come with each application, we can assume that they will be downloaded simultaneously. Therefore, the time taken to download all 24 files would be approximately 24/2 = 12 hours.;;
Response:  We know that there are 242 cards in total and Jeff has 136 of them. So, we need to find out how many cards Nell has. To do this, we can divide the total number of cards by the number of cards Jeff has:  Number of cards Nell has = Total number of cards / Number of cards Jeff has = 242 / 136 = 180 Therefore, Nell has 180 cards.;;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 301 cards and he gave 154 of them to Nell. So, we can calculate the number of cards left with Jeff as follows:  Number of cards left with Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Nell = 301 - 154 = 147 cards. Therefore, there are 147 cards left with Jeff.;;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 11 cards and Nell has 528 cards. To find out how many cards Nell has more than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards Jeff has from the total number of cards Nell has. So, 528 - 11 = 517. Therefore, Nell has 517 more cards than Jeff.;;
Response:  We know that Jeff has 234 cards and we want to find out how many more cards he needs to have in order to catch up with Nell who has 566 cards. So, we can start by subtracting the number of cards that Jeff has from the total number of cards that Nell has: 566 - 234 = 332. Therefore, Jeff needs 332 more cards to catch up with Nell.;;
Response:  We know that there are 309 cards in total for baseball and 356 cards in total for basketball. So, if we subtract the number of cards for baseball from the total number of cards, we get 309 - 309 = 0. Similarly, if we subtract the number of cards for basketball from the total number of cards, we get 356 - 356 = 0. Therefore, the difference between the number of cards for baseball and basketball is zero (0). Now, let's find out how many cards Jeff has for each sport. For baseball, Jeff has 415 cards, and for basketball, he has 149 cards. So, the ratio of cards for baseball to cards for basketball is 415/149 = 2.7. Finally, we need to multiply this ratio by the total number of cards to find out how many cards Nell has for each sport. So, if we multiply 2.7 by the total number of cards (309 + 356), we get 863. Therefore, Nell has 863 cards for baseball and 863 cards for basketball.;;
Response:  We have 246 cards of basketball and 214 cards of soccer. If we subtract the number of cards of soccer from the total number of cards of basketball, we get 32 ( = 246 - 214). Now, let's divide the remaining number of cards of basketball by 10 to find out how many cards each player has gotten. So, each player gets approximately 3.2 cards ( = 32 / 10). Therefore, if Jeff has 404 cards of baseball and there are 495 players in total, then each player gets approximately 1.2 cards ( = 404 / 495).;;
Response:  We know that there are 573 cards in total and we have to divide them equally among two people, John and Jeff. So, each of them will get an equal number of cards. Now, let's calculate how many cards each person will get: Number of cards for John = Total number of cards / 2 = 573/2 = 286 cards Number of cards for Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards for John = 573 - 286 = 287 cards Now, we need to find out how many cards Nell has left after giving some to John and Jeff. Number of cards left with Nell = Total number of cards - (Number of cards given to John + Number of cards given to Jeff) = 573 - (286 + 287) = 100 cards Therefore, Nell has 100 cards left.;;
Response:  We know that there are 438 cards in total for basketball and 18 cards for tennis. So, we can calculate the number of cards for each sport as follows: Basketball = 438 Cards Tennis = 18 Cards Now, let's find out how many cards Jeff has for each sport: For basketball, Jeff has 55 cards, which means he has (55/438) x 100% = 12% of the total basketball cards. Similarly, for tennis, Jeff has 178 cards, which means he has (178/18) x 100% = 99% of the total tennis cards. Therefore, the ratio of basketball cards to tennis cards owned by Jeff is 12 : 99 or 1 : 8.;;
Response:  We know that there are 239 cards in total for basketball and 38 cards for tennis. So, we can calculate the number of cards for each sport as follows: Basketball = 239 cards - 38 cards = 201 cards Tennis = 38 cards Now, let's find out how many cards Jeff has collected for each sport: Basketball = 376 cards x 10 = 3760 cards Baseball = 111 cards x 10 = 1110 cards Total number of cards collected by Jeff = Basketball + Baseball = 3760 + 1110 = 4870 cards Therefore, the number of cards collected by Jeff is 4870 cards.;;
Response:  Paco has 19 cookies and wants to share them equally among 35 people. So he will have to give each person an average of (19/35) = 0.546 cookies per person. Since we can't give fractional cookies, Paco will actually give each person 546 cookies in total.;;
Response:  If Paco has 28 biscuits and he gives 7 to Dewey, then Paco has 28 - 7 = 21 biscuits left. Now, if each of Dewey's cookies weighs 0.5 kg (which is equivalent to 500 grams), then the total weight of all of Dewey's cookies would be 7 x 0.5 kg = 3.5 kg. Since Paco has 21 biscuits left after giving some to Dewey, and each biscuit weighs 0.1 kg (which is equivalent to 100 grams), then the total weight of all of Paco's remaining biscuits would be 21 x 0.1 kg = 2.1 kg. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco can make with his remaining biscuits is 2.1 kg / 0.5 kg per cookie = 4.2 cookies.;;
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 biscuits and he gives 2 to Wong-Wong. So, Paco now has 38 biscuits left. Then, Wong-Wong takes another 37 cookies from the jar. Now, there are only 1 biscuit left in the jar which is owned by Paco. Therefore, the number of biscuits that Paco has after Wong-Wong took all the cookies is 38 + 37 = 75 biscuits.;;
"Response:  We have:
Paco has 25 biscuits.
Dewi has 5 sacks of rice.
Wong-wong has 3 cookies.
Liyane has 3 cookies.
Tinu has 10 cookies.
Now let's calculate how many cookies each person has in total:
Paco has 25 biscuits x 3 = 75 cookies.
Dewi has 5 sacks of rice x 40 = 200 cookies. (Note: Each sack contains 40 cookies.)
Wong-wong has 3 cookies + 3 cookies from Liyane = 6 cookies.
Liyane has 3 cookies + 3 cookies from Wong-wong = 6 cookies.
Tinu has 10 cookies.
Therefore, the total number of cookies among all five people is: 75 + 200 + 6 + 6 + 10 = 397 cookies.";;
Response:  We know that Paco has 13 biscuits and he gives 2 to Wong-Wong. So, Paco now has 13 - 2 = 11 biscuits left. Then, Wong-Wong takes another 2 biscuits from Paco, so Wong-Wong now has 2 + 2 = 4 biscuits. Now, we have 11 - 4 = 7 biscuits remaining with Paco. Finally, Banjur takes 36 cookies from Liyane, leaving Liyane with none. Therefore, the number of cookies that Banjur took is 36.;;
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 biscuits and Dewi has 5 cookies. If we divide the number of cookies Dewi has (5) by the number of biscuits Paco has (40), we get a ratio of 1/8 or 0.125. So, if Paco gives one biscuit to each of his friends, he will have 40 - 4 = 36 biscuits left. Now, let's calculate how many cookies Dewi can get from Paco's remaining biscuits. Since Dewi wants to eat as much as possible, she will take all the remaining biscuits. Therefore, the number of cookies Dewi gets from Paco's remaining biscuits is equal to the total number of biscuits Paco had initially, which is 40. So, the final answer is 40 cookies.;;
"Response:  We have:
Paco has 17 biscuits and he gives 14 to Dewey. So, Paco has 17 - 14 = 3 more biscuits than Dewey. Now, we know that Dewey has 14 cookies and 13 of them are KanCanés. Therefore, Dewey has 14 - 13 = 1 more KanCane than Paco. Finally, since Manéh also has some biscuits, let's assume he has x biscuits. Then, we can conclude that Manéh has x + 3 > 17 (since Paco has 3 more biscuits) and x + 3 < 20 (since Dewey has 1 less KanCane). Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Manéh has 15 biscuits in total.";;
Response:  We have 12 biscuits in one pack and each pack contains 4 rows of 3 biscuits each. So we can calculate the total number of biscuits as follows: Number of biscuits = Total number of packs x Number of biscuits per pack = 12 x 4 = 48 biscuits Now let's consider the second part of the question where there are 16 cookies in one bag and each bag contains 4 rows of 4 cookies each. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of cookies as follows: Number of cookies = Total number of bags x Number of cookies per bag = 16 x 4 = 64 cookies Finally, to find out how many more cookies than biscuits there are, we simply subtract the number of biscuits from the number of cookies: More cookies than biscuits = Number of cookies - Number of biscuits = 64 - 48 = 16 more cookies than biscuits Therefore, there are 16 more cookies than biscuits.;;
Response:  Paco has 22 cookies and gives 7 of them to Duwe. So, Paco now has 22 - 7 = 15 cookies left.  Then, Duwe takes 15 cookies from Paco and gives 5 of them to Mangan. So, Duwe now has 15 - 5 = 10 cookies left. Finally, Mangan takes 10 cookies from Duwe and gives 3 of them to Asin. So, Mangan now has 10 - 3 = 7 cookies left. Therefore, Piraya (the third person) gets 7 cookies from Mangan.;;
Response:  Paco has 9 cookies and gives 6 to Ana. So, Paco now has 9 - 6 = 3 cookies left.  Then, Ana has 36 cookies and gives 3 to Paco. So, Ana now has 36 - 3 = 33 cookies left. Therefore, Paco has 3 cookies and Ana has 33 cookies.;;
Response:  Paco has 37 cookies and gives 11 of them to Duwe. Then, Duwe gives 5 of his cookies to Mangan. So, the total number of cookies that Paco gave away is 11 + 5 = 16. Now, there are 37 - 16 = 21 cookies left with Paco.;;
Response:  We have 8 biscuits of Paco Mangan that are manis (sweet), and we also have 6 biscuits of Asin (sour). So far, we have a total of 14 biscuits. Then, we have 20 cookies of Manis that are sweet, and we also have 34 cookies of Asin that are sour. In total, we have 54 cookies. Now, let's calculate the ratio between the number of sweet cookies to the number of sour cookies: Sweet cookies / Sour cookies = 20/34 = 0.64 or approximately 1/1.64. Therefore, if you were to mix all the cookies together randomly without looking at them, there would be approximately one sour cookie for every 1.64 sweet cookies.;;
Response:  Paco has 36 cookies and he wants to share them equally among his friends. If there are 37 friends, each friend will get 1 cookie less than Paco has. So, Paco will have 36/37 = 0.95 cookies left after sharing with his friends.;;
Response:  We know that Paco has 36 biscuits and he gives 14 to his friend. So, the number of cookies left with Paco is 36 - 14 = 22. Now, we are asked how many cookies Sing (Paco's friend) gets from him. Since Sing gets 10 cookies from Paco, the number of cookies Sing gets is 10. Therefore, the final answer is 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left with Paco after giving them to Sing.;;
Response:  We have 41 biscuits in total (Paco has 30 and Dewi has 11).  If we divide them equally among 9 people, each person will get 4.67 biscuits (rounded to nearest whole number). Now, if we subtract the number of biscuits that Paco gave to Dewi (18), then the remaining amount of biscuits for Paco is 22 (41 - 18 = 22). So, the answer is 22.;;
Response:  Paco has 6 cookies and Dheweke has 30 cookies. Mangan has 23 cookies. To find out how many cookies Pirac can make with the remaining ingredients, we need to subtract the number of cookies that Paco and Dheweke have from the total number of cookies that Mangan has. So, the answer is:  Number of cookies Pirac can make = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies owned by Paco and Dheweke = 23 - 6 + 30 = 17;;
Response:  Paco has 97 cookies and gives 34 to Lan. So, Paco now has 97 - 34 = 63 cookies left.  Then, he gives 15 more cookies to Mani, so Paco now has 63 + 15 = 78 cookies left. Finally, he gives 56 cookies to Asin, so Paco now has 78 - 56 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, Piraya has 22 cookies left after giving some to all three people.;;
Response:  Paco has 26 biscuits that are sweet and 17 that are sour.  Dewey has 14 cookies that are sweet and 9 that are sour. If we take one of Paco's sweet biscuits and give it to Dewey, then Dewey will have 15 sweet cookies (including the ones he already had) plus the one from Paco, which makes a total of 16 sweet cookies. So, the number of sweet cookies that Paco has left after giving one to Dewey is 26 - 16 = 10.;;
"Response: 
Paco has 39 cookies and gives 6 to Asin. So, Paco now has 39 - 6 = 33 cookies left.
Asin has 23 cookies and gets 32 more from Duwe. So, Asin now has 23 + 32 = 55 cookies in total.
Now, let's compare the number of cookies that each person has after receiving their respective shares.
Paco had 33 cookies before giving some to Asin, and he now has 55 cookies (including the ones he got from Duwe) in total.
Asin started with 0 cookies and received 55 cookies from Duwe, so she now has 55 cookies in her possession.
Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies that Paco has after receiving his share from Duwe and the number of cookies that Asin receives from Duwe is:
55 (cookies received by Asin) - 33 (cookies Paco had before giving some to Asin) = 22
So, the answer is 22.";;
Response:  Paco has 40 cookies in total (including both manis and asin). He gives away 25 of them to someone else. So now he has 40 - 25 = 15 cookies left.  Then, Duwe comes along and takes 15 cookies from Paco. Now Paco has 15 - 15 = 0 cookies left.  Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco has after Duwe took some is 0.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $7 last year and spent $5 of it. So, the amount left with her after spending is $7 - $5 = $2.;;
Response:  If Gwen spent $8 more than she earned, and she earned $6 per week, then...;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 less than her mother's amount of money. So, if her mother had $4, then Gwen got $2 less than that, which means she got $2. Now, we are asked to find out how much money Gwen has after deducting $3 from it. Therefore, Gwen has $5 left after deducting $3 ($2 + $3 = $5).;;
"Response: 
Gwen received $8 from her grandmother and spent $5 on something. Her father gave her $4 as pocket money. So, how much money did Gwen have left after spending $5 and receiving $4 from her father?
Let X be the amount of money Gwen had left after spending $5. Since she received $4 from her father, her new balance is X + $4 = $12 (since $12 is the total amount of money she received).
Now, let Y be the amount of money Gwen had before spending $5. We know that Y + $5 = $8 (since $8 is the amount of money Gwen received from her grandmother).
So, we can set up two equations based on the given information:
Y + $5 = $8... (1)
X + $4 = $12... (2)
Solving for X, we get:
X = $8 - $4 = $4
Therefore, Gwen had $4 left after spending $5 and receiving $4 from her father.";;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 less than what her father gave her. So, if her father gave her $6, then she received $3 less than that, which is $3 - $6 = -$3.  Secondly, we are told that Yen gave her $4 more than what her mother took from her. So, if Yen gave her $4, then her mother took $4 - $4 = $0 from her.  Finally, we are asked to find out how much money did Gwen have after her mother took money from her. Since her mother took nothing from her, Gwen had the original amount of money given to her by her father minus the amount her mother gave her (which is $0). Therefore, Gwen had $6 - ($3 - $6) = $3.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and spent $7 on something else. So, she has $5 - $7 = $2 left. Then, she gave $4 to someone else. Therefore, Gwen now has $2 + $4 = $6 remaining.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and spent $2 on something. So, she has $3 left ($5 - $2 = $3). Then, she gave $6 to her friend. So, now Gwen has $9 left ($3 + $6 = $9). Finally, her brother took $4 from her, leaving her with $5 again ($9 - $4 = $5). Therefore, the amount of money Gwen had after giving it to her friend is $5.;;
Response:  We know that Josh has 9 marbles in his collection and he wants to divide them equally among 4 of his friends. So, each friend will get how many marbles?  To find out, we can use division.  Division is when you divide one number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 9 marbles into 4 groups. How many marbles will each group have?  We can solve this problem like this: 9 ÷ 4 = 2.25. Since we cannot give fractional marbles (like 2.25), each friend will get 3 marbles. Therefore, the answer is 3 marbles per friend.;;
Response:  We have 21 marbles in total and we want to divide them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 5 marbles (21/4 = 5). Now let's say that after dividing them equally, there are still some marbles left over, which is 12 marbles. Therefore, the remaining marbles will be distributed among the 3 people who didn't get any marbles initially, so they will each get 4 marbles (12/3 = 4).;;
Response:  We know that Josh has 19 marbles in total and he needs to collect 11 more marbles to complete his collection. So, we can start counting from 12 (the number of marbles Josh already has) until 20 (the total number of marbles Josh wants to have). Therefore, the answer is 14.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has 4 marbles in his collection and he needs 16 marbles to complete one set of 8 anyar (a traditional Malay game). So, we need to find out how many sets of 8 anyar Josh can make with the 4 marbles he has. To do this, we divide the number of marbles he has by the number required for each set: 4 marbles / 8 anyar = 0.5 or  half a set. Therefore, Josh can make half a set of 8 anyar with the 4 marbles he has.;;
Response:  We have 7 marbles in total and we need to make 10 balls of equal size. So, we will divide them into groups of 2 or 3 marbles each. The remaining marble will be left over after forming all the balls. Therefore, the number of marbles needed to make 10 balls is: 7 - (number of groups x number of marbles in each group) = 7 - (2 x 3) = 7 - 6 = 1. So, one marble is left over after making 10 balls.;;

So, in total, we have 28 x (number of rounds played) = 28 x 7 = 196 hiding spots. Now, let's assume that each round takes approximately 5 minutes to play, so the total time taken for all rounds = 196 hiding spots x 5 minutes/hiding spot = 980 minutes. Finally, since there are 30 boys in total, including the last boy remaining as ""it,"" the number of times he will be ""it"" = Total time taken / Time taken per round = 980 minutes / 5 minutes/round = 196 rounds. Therefore, the pira cacahé bocah (the last boy remaining as ""it"") will be ""it"" 196 times.";;

Response:  Tukang roti has sold 145 books. If he wants to divide them equally among his 72 customers, each customer will get 2 books (145 / 72 = 2). However, since there are still some books left over after dividing them equally among the customers, let's assume that Tukang roti has 30 books left over (2 x 72 - 145 = 30). So, out of the total number of books sold, 30 books were not given to any customer and are left over.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he has sold 155 rotis in total. Now, let's calculate the number of rotis sold per day. We know that there are 365 days in a year, so we can divide the total number of rotis sold by the number of days: 155 / 365 = x (where x is the number of rotis sold per day). Since Tukang Roti Nggawé operates from Monday to Sunday, we can assume that he sells an average of x rotis per day throughout the week. Next, we need to find out how many rotis were left unsold at the end of each day. To do this, we will use the information provided in the question that Tukang Roti Nggawé had 140 customers who did not buy any rotis. So, if x is the number of rotis sold per day, then the number of unsold rotis at the end of each day would be: x - 140. Finally, we need to find out how many rotis were left unsold at the end of the week. To do this, we will multiply the number of unsold rotis at the end of each day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): (x - 140) x 7 = y (where y is the number of rotis left unsold at the end of the week). Substituting the values we have obtained so far, we get: x = 28 (number of rotis sold per day) and y = 196 (number of rotis left unsold at the end of the week). Therefore, Tukang Roti Nggawé had 196 rotis left unsold at the end of the week.;;

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from selling those rotis. Based on the information provided, Tukang Roti Nggawé earned Rp 91 for each of the 13 rotis he sold, which means he earned a total of Rp 1,193 (Rp 91 x 13). Finally, we need to subtract the cost price of making one kue anyar from the total amount of money earned. According to the question, it costs Rp 154 to make one kue anyar. Subtracting this amount from the total amount of money earned gives us the profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé, which is Rp 1,039 (Rp 1,193 - Rp 154). So, the answer is 1039.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of customers who bought roti from Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, there were 149 customers in total. Next, we need to calculate the number of customers who did not buy any roti from Tukang Roti Nggawé. Based on the question, there were 91 customers who did not buy any roti from Tukang Roti Nggawé. Therefore, the difference between the total number of customers and those who did not buy any roti is :  Total Number of Customers - Number of Customers Who Did Not Buy Any Roti = 149 - 91 = 58 customers. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of customers who did not buy any roti from Tukang Roti Nggawé relative to the total number of customers. To do this, we divide the number of customers who did not buy any roti by the total number of customers and multiply by 100% : Percentage of Customers Who Did Not Buy Any Roti / Total Number of Customers x 100% = (58/149) x 100% = 39.27%. So, approximately 39.27% of customers did not buy any roti from Tukang Roti Nggawé.;;

So, the total amount of money earned by Tukang Roti Damel is:  Total earnings = Number of pieces sold x Price per piece + Amount given away = 7 x Rp 148 + Rp 15 x 103 = Rp 962 + Rp 1575 = Rp 2537  Therefore, the answer is Rp 2537.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by the vendor. According to the question, the vendor has sold 126 rotis in total. Now, let's find out how many rotis were sold to each customer. From the question, we know that there are 48 customers who have bought rotis from the vendor. Therefore, the average number of rotis sold per customer is: Number of rotis sold per customer = Total number of rotis sold / Number of customers = 126 / 48 = 2  So, each customer bought an average of 2 rotis from the vendor. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned by the vendor from selling these rotis. According to the question, the price of each roti is IDR 3000. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the vendor can be calculated as follows: Total amount of money earned = Number of rotis sold x Price of each roti = 2 x IDR 3000 = IDR 6000 Finally, we need to divide this amount by the number of customers who purchased rotis from the vendor to get the average amount spent per customer. This gives us: Average amount spent per customer = Total amount of money earned / Number of customers = IDR 6000 / 48 = IDR 125 per customer So, on average, each customer spent IDR 125 on buying rotis from the vendor.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he sold 19 rotis in total. Now, let's calculate the average price of each roti based on the number of customers who bought them. The average price per customer is calculated as follows: Number of customers x Price per customer = Total revenue From this calculation, we can see that the total revenue from selling rotis was IDR 131 jajan (or USD 9). Next, we need to subtract the cost of making one roti, which is IDR 50 jajan (or USD 3.6) according to the question. Therefore, the profit from selling rotis is: Profit = Total revenue - Cost of making one roti = IDR 81 jajan (or USD 5.4) Finally, we need to divide the profit by the number of customers who bought rotis to get the average price paid per customer: Average price paid per customer = Profit / Number of customers = IDR 81 jajan / 19 customers = approximately IDR 4.27 or USD 0.30 per customer Based on these calculations, the answer to the question is approximately IDR 4.27 or USD 0.30 per customer.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he sold 157 rotis in total. Now, let's count the number of rotis sold for each customer. There were 169 customers who bought rotis from Tukang Roti Nggawé. Therefore, the average number of rotis sold per customer is:

$$ \text{Average number of rotis sold per customer} = \frac{\text{Total number of rotis sold}}{ \text{Number of customers}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Average number of rotis sold per customer} = \frac{157}{169}} = 0.92 } $$

Now, let's find out how many bakers are needed to make all these rotis. We know that there are 158 customers who bought rotis from Tukang Roti Nggawé and 147 customers who did not buy any rotis from him. To determine the number of bakers required, we can use the following formula:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bakers required} = \frac{\text{Total number of rotis sold}}{\text{Number of customers who bought rotis}}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of bakers required} = \frac{157}{158}} = 1 } $$

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, there needs to be at least one baker to produce all the rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he sold 54 rotis in total. Now, let's calculate the average price per roti based on the number of customers who bought from him. The question states that there were 143 customers who bought rotis from Tukang Roti Nggawé, and each customer bought an average of 68 rotis. Therefore, the total revenue generated by Tukang Roti Nggawé is: Total Revenue = Number of Customers x Average Price Per Customer = 143 Customers x $X = $X Where X represents the average price per roti. To find out the average price per roti, we can divide the total revenue by the number of rotis sold: Average Price Per Roti = Total Revenue / Number of Rotis Sold = $X / 54 Rotis = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/54 = $X/;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of rotis that Tukang Roti Adol can make in one day. According to the question, he makes 44 rotis per day. Now, let's assume that each roti takes him 10 minutes to prepare. Therefore, the total time taken by Tukang Roti Adol to prepare all 44 rotis is: Time = Number of rotis x Time per roti = 44 x 10 = 440 minutes. Next, we need to calculate the number of customers who come to buy rotis from him. Based on the question, there are 48 customers who come to buy rotis from him. Finally, we need to calculate the average time taken by each customer to eat their roti. According to the question, it takes them 5 minutes to finish eating their roti. Therefore, the total time taken by all 48 customers to eat their rotis is: Time = Number of customers x Time per customer = 48 x 5 = 240 minutes. Now, let's calculate the difference between the total time taken by Tukang Roti Adol and the total time taken by all his customers to eat their rotis: Difference = Total time taken by Tukang Roti Adol - Total time taken by customers to eat rotis = 440 - 240 = 200 minutes. So, Tukang Roti Adol has 200 extra minutes at his disposal after finishing preparing all 44 rotis and before all his customers arrive to buy and eat them.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Adol. According to the question, he has sold 8 rotis in total. Therefore, the total number of rotis sold is 8. Next, we need to calculate the average price of each roti. Based on the question, the price of each roti is Rp 15,000. So, the total amount of money earned from selling rotis is 8 x Rp 15,000 = Rp 120,000. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of profit made by Tukang Roti Adol. To do this, we divide the total amount of money earned (Rp 120,000) by the total cost of making and selling the rotis (Rp 60,000). This gives us a profit margin of 50% or Rp 60,000 / Rp 120,000 = 0.5 x 100%.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Kancana. According to the question, she sold 137 rotis in total. Now, let's find out how many rotis she sold per day. To do this, we divide the total number of rotis sold by the number of days she worked (which is given as 10 days). So, the number of rotis sold per day = Total number of rotis sold / Number of days worked = 137 / 10 = 13.7 rotis per day. Next, we need to calculate the average price of each roti. Based on the question, the price of each roti is Rp 5000. Therefore, the average price of one roti = Total revenue from rotis sold / Number of rotis sold = Rp 5000 x 13.7 = Rp 68.50 per roti. Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from all the sales made by Kancana during her 10-day work period. To do this, we multiply the average price of each roti by the total number of rotis sold. So, the total revenue from all sales = Average price of each roti x Total number of rotis sold = Rp 68.50 x 137 = Rp 9,242.50.;;
Response:  We know that Tukang Roti has sold 173 pieces of roti and Dheweke has bought 103 pieces of anyar (spring roll). Adol has bought 86 pieces of kue (cake) from Baker. So, we can calculate it as follows: Total number of pieces of roti sold = 173 Total number of pieces of anyar bought = 103 Total number of pieces of cake bought = 86 Number of pieces of each item sold by Baker = Total number of pieces of each item sold / Total number of items sold Therefore, the answer to the question is: Baker has sold 25 pieces of roti, 49 pieces of anyar, and 67 pieces of cake.;;

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 62 customers who have ordered roti. If each customer orders one kue maneh, then the total number of kue maneh sold is 62 x 1 = 62. Next, we know that there are 149 pieces of kue maneh in total. Therefore, if we subtract the number of kue maneh sold (62) from the total number of kue maneh (149), we get 87. So, the baker has sold 87 kue maneh.;;
Response:  Tukang roti nggawe 81 kue means that he baked 81 pieces of bread. Banjur dhèwèqué nggawé 92 kue manèh means that she bought 92 pieces of bread. Dhèwèqué adol 46 buku means that there are 46 books in total. Now, let's calculate how many books each person got based on their share of the bread:  For Tukang roti, since he baked 81 pieces of bread, he got 81/2 = 40.5 books (round up to 41 books). For Banjur dhèwèqué, since she bought 92 pieces of bread, she got 92/3 = 30.7 books (round down to 30 books). Finally, for Adol, since there were 46 books in total and he had 41 books from his share of the bread, he got 46 - 41 = 5 books. Therefore, the answer is 41 books for Tukang roti, 30 books for Banjur dhèwèqué, and 5 books for Adol.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of customers who bought roti. According to the question, there were 61 customers who bought roti in total. Therefore, the total number of customers who bought roti is 61. Next, we need to calculate the number of customers who did not buy any roti. According to the question, there were 167 customers who did not buy any roti in total. Therefore, the number of customers who did not buy any roti is 167. Now, let's find out how many customers bought roti and took away their orders without paying for them. According to the question, there were 108 customers who took away their orders without paying for them. Therefore, the number of customers who bought roti and took away their orders without paying for them is 108. Finally, let's find out how many customers paid for their orders. According to the question, there were 44 customers who paid for their orders. Therefore, the number of customers who paid for their orders is 44.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of customers who bought roti. From the question, we know that there were 56 customers who bought roti in total. Therefore, the calculation is as follows: Total number of customers who bought roti = 56. Next, we need to calculate the number of customers who did not buy roti. From the question, we know that there were 124 customers in total. Subtracting the number of customers who bought roti from the total number of customers gives us the number of customers who did not buy roti: Number of customers who did not buy roti = 124 - 56 = 68. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of customers who did not buy roti by dividing the number of customers who did not buy roti by the total number of customers and multiplying by 100: Percentage of customers who did not buy roti = (68 / 124) x 100 = 54%.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he sold 52 rotis in total. Now, let's calculate the average price of each roti based on the information provided in the question. The average price of each roti is calculated as follows: Total revenue from selling rotis = Number of rotis x Price of each roti Average price of each roti = Total revenue / Number of rotis Therefore, the average price of each roti for Tukang Roti Nggawé is: $ \boxed {52} \times \boxed {Rp 3000} = Rp 160,000 $ Next, we need to calculate the profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé. Profit = Revenue - Costs Revenue = Average price of each roti x Number of rotis sold Costs include all expenses related to running the business, such as ingredients, fuel, and labor costs. For this example, let's assume that Tukang Roti Nggawé spent Rp 5000 per roti on ingredients and Rp 2000 on fuel. Therefore, his total costs are: Costs = Ingredient cost + Fuel cost = Rp 5000 + Rp 2000 = Rp 7000 Percentage of profit = Profit margin (%) = Profit / Total revenue x 100% Profit margin = (Profit / Total revenue) x 100% = ($ 160,000 / Rp 160,000) x 100% = 100% Finally, we can calculate the percentage of profit earned by Tukang Roti Nggawé: Percentage of profit = 100% So, Tukang Roti Nggawé earned a 100% profit on each roti he sold.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of customers who bought roti. According to the question, there were 134 customers who bought roti. Therefore, the total number of customers is 134. Next, we need to calculate the average amount spent per customer. Based on the question, the average amount spent per customer was IDR 140,000. So, we divide the total amount spent (IDR 18,640,000) by the total number of customers (134): IDR 140,000 / 134 = IDR 105,700. Finally, we subtract the cost price from the selling price to get the profit. The profit is calculated as follows: IDR 105,700 - IDR 70,000 = IDR 35,700. Therefore, the profit made by the vendor is IDR 35,700.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé. According to the question, he has sold 14 rotis in total. Now, let's count how many rotis each customer bought. There are 8 customers who have bought rotis from Tukang Roti Nggawé, and each customer bought an average of 2 rotis (based on the information provided). Therefore, the total number of rotis sold by Tukang Roti Nggawé is:  Total Number of Rotis Sold = Number of Customers x Average Number of Rotis Bought = 8 x 2 = 16 rotis. Next, we need to calculate the profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé per piece of roti. Based on the question, he makes Rp 100 for every roti he sells. So, if he sold 16 rotis, his total profit would be:  Profit Per Piece of Ro ti = Price per Piece x Number of Rotis Sold = Rp 100 x 16 = Rp 1,600. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of profit that Baker got out of the total profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé. To do this, we divide the amount of money that Baker received (Rp 1,600) by the total profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé (Rp 1,600):  Percentage of Profit Received by Baker = Amount of Money Received / Total Profit Made = Rp 1,600 / Rp 1,600 = 100%. Therefore, Baker received 100% of the total profit made by Tukang Roti Nggawé, which is Rp 1,600.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of customers who bought roti. According to the question, there were 43 customers who bought roti in total. Now, let's count the number of customers who bought roti per day. Based on the information provided earlier, there were 114 customers in total, and they bought roti for 15 days. Therefore, the number of customers who bought roti per day is:  Number of customers who bought roti per day = Total number of customers x Number of days = 114 x 15 = 1690 So, there were 1690 customers who bought roti during those 15 days. Next, we need to find out how many rotis each customer bought. According to the question, the average number of rotis purchased per customer was 2. Therefore, the total number of rotis sold can be calculated as follows: Total number of rotis sold = Number of customers x Average number of rotis purchased per customer = 1690 x 2 = 3380 Finally, we need to divide the total number of rotis sold by the number of days they were available for sale to get the average number of rotis sold per day. The calculation is as follows: Average number of rotis sold per day = Total number of rotis sold / Number of days = 3380 / 15 = 225 rotis sold per day Conclusion: Therefore, based on the given data, there were approximately 225 rotis sold per day at the stall.;;
"Response:  We have to find out how many games are in each category and then add them up.  For example, if we look at the first category ""Kelly"", there are 5 games. So, we multiply 5 by 22 (the number of games) and get 110. Now, let's move on to the second category ""Nintendo"". There are 7 games under this category. If we multiply 7 by 22, we get 154. Finally, for the third category ""Pira"", there are 3 games. Multiplying 3 by 22 gives us 66. Therefore, the total number of games is 110 + 154 + 66 = 330.";;
"Response:  We know that ""Kelly"" has played 106 games of the Nintendo 64 game. If we divide this number by 2 (since each game takes approximately 2 hours to complete), we get around 53 hours of playtime. Therefore, the answer is 53.";;
Response:  If we have 91 games in total and we want to know how many are from Nintendo, then we can say that the number of Nintendo games is equal to 91 minus the number of non-Nintendo games.

Response:  We have 52 blocks to build a tower and we want to know how many blocks will be left if we use 38 blocks for the foundation. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for foundation = 52 - 38 = 14 blocks. Therefore, there are 14 blocks remaining after using 38 blocks for the foundation.;;
Response:  We have to build a tower with 97 blocks and we want to know how many blocks will be left if we take 72 blocks from it. So, we can start counting from the top of the tower and count down 72 blocks. The remaining blocks are:  $97 - 72 = 25$ blocks. Therefore, there will be $25$ blocks left after taking $72$ blocks from the tower.;;
Response:  We have 79 blocks of land and we want to build a tower with 14 blocks high. To find out how many blocks are left for building the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the total number of blocks available. So, the answer is:  Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower = 79 - 14 = 65 blocks.;;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks Randy needs to build a tower and an omah (a small house). The information given in the question is as follows:  • Randy has 58 blocks to build a tower.  • There are 27 blocks in each level of the tower.  • Randy wants to build a tower that is 10 levels high.  • Each level of the tower takes 5 blocks to build.  Now we can calculate how many blocks Randy needs to build the tower: Level 1: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 2: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 3: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 4: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 5: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 6: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 7: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 8: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 9: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Level 10: 27 blocks x 5 = 135 blocks Total number of blocks needed for building the tower = 135 + 135 + 135 + 135 + 135 + 135 + 135 + 135 = 1,000 blocks Now let's find out how many blocks Randy needs to build an omah: • Randy has 53 blocks left after building the tower. So he needs to use these blocks to build an omah. To do this, we need to divide the remaining blocks by the number of blocks required to build one level of the omah. The height of the omah is equal to the height of the tower minus the number of blocks used to build it. In this case, the height of the omah is 10 - 135 = 25 blocks. Therefore, the number of blocks Randy needs to build an omah is: Number of blocks needed to build an omah = Remaining blocks / Number of blocks per level of the omah = 5;;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks Randy needs to build a tower that is 37 blocks high and has a base of 33 blocks wide. To do this, we need to use the formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism, which is: Volume = Length x Width x Height In this case, the length (L) is equal to the width (W) times the height (H), so we can write: V = W x H x H Where V is the volume of the tower in cubic blocks, W is the width of the base in blocks, and H is the height of the tower in blocks. Now, let's plug in the values given in the problem: W = 33 blocks H = 37 blocks So, the volume of the tower is: V = 33 x 37 x 37 = 4659 cubic blocks This means that Randy needs 4659 blocks to build the tower.;;
"Response:  We have to find out how many blocks Randy needs to build an omah (a small house) and then subtract that number from the total number of blocks he has.  So, let's calculate it:
Randy has 86 blocks in total. To build an omah, he needs 79 blocks. Therefore, the difference between the total number of blocks Randy has and the number of blocks needed for building an omah is:
86 - 79 = 8
So, Randy has 8 extra blocks left after building an omah.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many blocks Randy has built so far. According to the question, Randy has built 36 blocks of the tower. Now, we need to find out how many blocks are left to build the entire tower. To do this, we can divide the total number of blocks (100 - 36) by the number of blocks Randy has built so far (36). Therefore, there are 64 blocks left to build the entire tower. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of blocks that Randy has completed so far. We can do this by dividing the number of blocks he has built (36) by the total number of blocks needed to complete the tower (64), which gives us a percentage of 56%.;;
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks Randy can make in one day if he works for 95 days and needs 20 blocks to build a small tower of 50 blocks high. So, we need to calculate the number of blocks Randy can make per day. To do this, we divide the total number of blocks needed (20) by the number of days worked (95): Number of blocks Randy can make per day = Total number of blocks needed / Number of days worked = 20 / 95 = 0.218 or approximately 43 blocks per day. Therefore, Randy can make approximately 43 blocks per day.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many blocks Randy has in total. We are given that he has 90 blocks and needs to build an omah (a small house) with 63 blocks. So, Randy has 90 - 63 = 27 blocks left after building the omah. Now, let's calculate how many blocks Kanggo needs to build a menara (a tower). We are given that Kanggo needs 89 blocks to build the menara. Therefore, Kanggo will have 89 - 27 = 62 blocks left after building the menara. Thus, Pira has 62 blocks to spare after building both the omah and the menara.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many books Ana has in total. According to the question, Ana has 20 books in her collection.  Next, we need to determine how many books are in each series. The question states that there are five different series with varying numbers of books in each series. Therefore, we can assume that each series contains a different number of books.  Now, let's calculate the number of books Ana has in each series based on the information provided in the question: Series A - 3 books Series B - 4 books Series C - 5 books Series D - 6 books Series E - 7 books Based on these calculations, we can conclude that Ana has a total of 20 books in her collection, and each series contains a different number of books as follows: Series A - 3 books Series B - 4 books Series C - 5 books Series D - 6 books Series E - 7 books To answer the final part of the question, if Ana were to give away 5 books from each series, she would have 15 books left in her collection (since each series contains 5 books).;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many books Ana has in total. According to the question, Ana has 13 books in her bag. Next, we need to find out how many of these books are from school. The question states that Ana has 8 books from school. Therefore, the number of books Ana has from school is 8. Finally, we can calculate the average number of books Ana reads per day by dividing the total number of books she has (13) by the number of days she wants to read (maos). So, the average number of books Ana reads per day is 13 / 7 = 1.86 books per day.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books Ana has read. According to the question, Ana has read 22 books. Therefore, the total number of books Ana has read is 22. Next, we need to calculate the total number of films Mirsani has watched. According to the question, Mirsani has watched 56 films. Therefore, the total number of films Mirsani has watched is 56. Now, let's compare the total number of books Ana has read with the total number of films Mirsani has watched. As shown above, the total number of books Ana has read is 22, while the total number of films Mirsani has watched is 56. Therefore, the ratio of the total number of books Ana has read to the total number of films Mirsani has watched is 22/56 = 0.4. So, the answer is 0.4.;;
"Response:  We know that Ana has 4 books and 17 films to watch. Each book can be watched multiple times (let's assume it takes around 2 hours to finish watching each movie), so we need to calculate how many hours Ana will spend watching all of them.

For the books, Ana has 4 options:

Book 1 - 2 hours
Book 2 - 2 hours
Book 3 - 2 hours
Book 4 - 2 hours
Total time for books = 8 hours

Now let's move on to the movies:
Ana has 17 films to watch, and each film lasts approximately 2 hours. Therefore, the total time needed to watch all 17 movies is:
Time for movies = 17 x 2 hours = 34 hours

Adding up the time spent on both books and movies, Ana needs at least 42 hours to complete everything (8 + 34). So, if she spends 8 hours per day watching/reading, it would take her around 5 days to finish everything (42 / 8 = 5.25 days).";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and films in both lists. Books: 16 + 14 = 30 Films: 13 + 19 = 32 Now, let's compare the numbers: 30 (books) vs 32 (films). Since there are more films than books, the final answer is:  More than 30 films.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and films that Ana has read or watched in her life.  For books, Ana has read 8 books, so the total number of books she has read is 8.  For films, Ana has watched 10 films, so the total number of films she has watched is 10.  Next, we need to find out how many times Ana has read each book or watched each film.  To do this, we can divide the total number of books or films by the number of times Ana has read or watched them.  For example, if Ana has read 8 books, then she has read each book once (since there are 8 books in total).  Similarly, if Ana has watched 10 films, then she has watched each film once (since there are 10 films in total).  Finally, we can multiply the number of times Ana has read or watched each book or film by the number of years she has lived to get the total number of times Ana has read or watched each book or film over her lifetime.  Using these calculations, we can determine the total number of times Ana has read or watched each book or film.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and movies that Ana has read or watched based on her statement.  From the given information, we know that Ana has read 10 books and watched 11 movies. Therefore, the total number of items she has consumed is:

Books = 10
Movies = 11

Next, we need to determine how many of these items are different from each other. Based on Ana's statement, all 10 books and 11 movies are different from each other. So, the number of unique items Ana has consumed is:

Unique Items = Books + Movies - (Number of repeated items)
= 10 + 11 - x
where x is the number of repeated items. Since Ana has not mentioned anything about repeating any items, let's assume there are no repeated items, so x = 0. Therefore, the number of unique items Ana has consumed is:

Unique Items = 10 + 11 = 21

Finally, we can calculate the average number of unique items Ana consumes per day as follows:

Average Unique Items/Day = Total Number of Items / Number of Days
= 21 / 13 (days in a week)
= 1.69 (approximately)

Therefore, based on the given information, Ana consumes approximately 1.69 unique items per day, which includes both books and movies.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and films mentioned in the question.  The total number of books is given as 11 + 7 = 18 books.  Similarly, the total number of films is given as 17 + 21 = 38 films.  Now, let's compare these two numbers to find out how many times each book or film appears in the list.  We can do this by dividing the total number of books or films by the number of appearances of each one.  For example, if a particular book appears 5 times in the list, then its frequency is 5 / 18 = 0.277 (or approximately 1/4).  Similarly, if a particular film appears 9 times in the list, then its frequency is 9 / 38 = 0.246 (or approximately 1/4).  Based on these frequencies, we can now calculate the average number of appearances of each book or film in the list.  To do this, we simply divide the total number of appearances by the total number of books or films.  So, for example, the average number of appearances of each book is 18 / 11 = 1.636 (or approximately 1.64), while the average number of appearances of each film is 38 / 17 = 2.118 (or approximately 2.12).  Therefore, based on these calculations, the answer to the question is 1.64 for books and 2.12 for films.;;
Response:  We are given that there are 8 books in the Maca series and each book has 20 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in all 8 books is:  Number of pages = Total number of books x Number of pages per book  Number of pages = 8 x 20  Number of pages = 160 pages Now, we are also given that there are 14 books in the entire series. So, to find out how many pages are in the entire series, we can multiply the number of pages in each book by the number of books in the series:  Pages in the entire series = Number of pages per book x Number of books in the series  Pages in the entire series = 160 x 14  Pages in the entire series = 2,240 pages;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books written by Ana and Mirsani combined. According to the question, Ana has written 62 films and Mirsani has written 34 books. Therefore, the total number of books is: 62 + 34 = 96 books. Next, we need to calculate the average number of pages in each book. Based on the information provided, the average number of pages in each book is: 96 books / 2 (Ana and Mirsani) = 48 pages per book. Finally, we can calculate the total number of pages in all the books written by both authors together: 48 pages/book x 96 books = 4704 pages.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ana has 8 films to watch and she wants to finish them before going to school.  Secondly, each film takes approximately 2 hours to complete, so in total, Ana needs to spend around 16 hours watching all 8 films (8 x 2 = 16). Thirdly, there are only 7 days left until Ana goes back to school, so if she spends 8 hours per day watching films, she will be able to finish all 8 films in time (8 hours/day x 7 days = 56 hours). Finally, since Ana also wants to watch 4 movies, which take approximately 2 hours each, she will need to allocate additional time for movie-watching (4 x 2 = 8 hours). Therefore, the total amount of time Ana needs to spend watching films and movies is:  Total Time Spent Watching Films + Movies = 56 hours + 8 hours = 64 hours. So, out of the 73 hours available before Ana goes back to school, Ana can spend around 64 hours watching films and movies.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books in both lists. In list A, there are 14 films and each film has 2 books, so the total number of books is 14 x 2 = 28 books. Similarly, in list B, there are 11 books and each book has 3 films, so the total number of films is 11 x 3 = 33 films. Therefore, the difference between the two lists is 33 - 28 = 5 more films in list B than list A.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books in both lists. In list A, there are 17 films and each film has 2-4 books, so the total number of books is 17 x 2 = 34 books. Similarly, in list B, there are 11 books and each book has 2-4 films, so the total number of films is 11 x 2 = 22 films. Therefore, the total number of books and films in both lists combined is 34 + 22 = 56 items. Now, let's count how many times each item appears in both lists. For example, the film ""Ana"" appears twice in list A and once in list B, so it counts as 2 + 1 = 3 items. Similarly, the book ""Lan"" appears thrice in list A and twice in list B, so it counts as 3 + 2 = 5 items. We can continue this process for all the other items in both lists until we have counted them all. After counting all the items, we find that there are 35 unique items in both lists (34 books + 22 films). So, the final answer is 56 / 35 = approximately 1.59 or rounded off to 2.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and films that Ana has read or watched.  From the question, we know that Ana has read 10 books and watched 6 films. Therefore, the total number of items Ana has consumed is:  Books: 10 Films: 6 Next, we need to determine how many of these items are different from each other. According to the question, out of the 10 books Ana has read, 5 are from the same series (sekolah konyol). So, the number of unique books Ana has read is:  Unique books: 5 Books: 10 - Unique books = 5 Films: 6 - Unique films = 6 Now, let's calculate the average number of items Ana consumes per day. To do this, we divide the total number of items she consumes by the number of days she spends reading or watching them: Average items per day:  Total items: 10 + 6 = 16 Days spent consuming items: 14 (as mentioned in the question) Average items per day: 16 / 14 = 1.14 items per day Finally, we can round off the result to the nearest whole number to get our final answer:  Ana consumes approximately 1 book or film every 1.14 days on average.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of books and films that Ana has read or watched.  From the question, we know that Ana has read 8 books and watched 5 films. Therefore, the total number of items Ana has consumed is:  Books: 8 + 5 = 13 Films: 0 (Ana has not watched any films) Next, we need to determine how many of these items are related to each other. According to the question, there are 19 files and 16 books that are relevant to each other. So, the number of items related to each other is: Files: 19 Books: 16 Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of related items out of the total number of items consumed. To do this, we divide the number of related items by the total number of items consumed: Percentage of related items: (19/29) x 100% = 66% Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Ana has read and watched a total of 13 books and 0 films, and 66% of these items are related to each other.;;
Response:  We know that Dave won 7 tickets from the arcade. If he wants to buy another ticket using one of his winning tickets as payment, then he will have to pay for the remaining amount (Rp 10,000 - Rp 5,000 = Rp 5,000). So, the number of tickets Dave can buy with his winning tickets is 7 / 5 = 1 and 4/5. Therefore, the answer is 1 and 4/5.;;
Response:  We know that Dave won $12 at the arcade and he bought 10 tickets for the car race. So, he has $12 / 10 = $1.20 left after buying the tickets. Now, we need to find out how many tickets Dave can buy with his remaining money. Therefore, we divide $1.20 by the cost of each ticket ($0.10): $1.20 / $0.10 = 12 tickets. So, Dave can buy 12 tickets for the car race.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave won 18 tickets from the arcade game. Then, he spent 5 tickets to buy a stuffed animal and another 11 tickets to buy snacks at the food stall. So, the total number of tickets left with Dave is: 18 - 5 = 13 tickets.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has won 19 tickets from the arcade game. Then, he has to share them equally among his 7 friends. So, each friend will get 3 tickets (19 / 7 = 3).

Therefore, the final answer is 1 ticket for Dave.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave has won 13 carcasses in total. Then, he has to share them equally among his 8 friends. So, each friend will get 13/8 = 1.625 carcasses. However, since rounding up is more convenient, let's assume each friend gets 1 and a half carcasses (1.5). Now, there are 18 Langkung Kanggé Tumbas Sandhangan Pinten Langkung Kathah tickets left, which means each ticket can be divided into 18/1.5 = 12 equal parts. Therefore, Dave will receive 12 x 0.5 = 6 tickets.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets. So, his total number of tickets is 14 - 2 = 12 tickets.  Then, we are asked how many times he can buy a ticket with the money he has left after buying 10 tickets. To calculate this, we need to divide the remaining amount of money (RM 50) by the price of one ticket (RM 1). Therefore, Dave can buy 50 / 1 = 50 tickets with the money he has left after buying 10 tickets.  Finally, we add the number of tickets Dave can buy with the original RM 100 (12 tickets) and the number of tickets he can buy with the remaining money (50 tickets), which gives us a total of 12 + 50 = 62 tickets.  So, the answer is 62 tickets.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pages are in one book of the Bible. According to the question, there are 13 books in the Old Testament and 39 books in the New Testament, making a total of 52 books in the Bible. Now, let's calculate the number of words in each book of the Bible. The average length of a book in the Bible is approximately 1000-2000 words per book. Therefore, if we assume that each book has an average length of 1500 words, then the total number of words in all 52 books would be around 78,000 words (1500 x 52 = 78,000). Finally, to determine the number of letters in each word, we can use the standard letter count for English language which is approximately 4 letters per word. So, the total number of letters in all 78,000 words would be around 312,000 letters (4 x 78,000 = 312,000).;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between two dates given in the question. The first date is ""Haley mati"" which means ""Haley died"". We don't know exactly when Haley died but based on the information provided, it must be before January 15th, 2023. Therefore, let's assume that Haley died on December 31st, 2022 (the last day of the year). Now, we have to find out how many days are there between December 31st, 2022 and January 15th, 2023. There are 14 days between these two dates.  Next, we need to calculate how many times 11 witnesses testified during those 14 days. Since each witness testifies for one day only, there are 11 witnesses who testify on different days. So, the total number of times 11 witnesses testify is 11 x 14 = 11 x 1.4 = 15.4. Finally, we multiply the number of days between the two dates by the number of times the 11 witnesses testify to get the total number of hearings: 14 days x 15.4 hearings = 216 hearings.";;

Now, let's calculate how many pieces of jeruk sing are left inside the basket after 25 days have passed. We know that each piece of jeruk sing can be preserved for 3 months (or 90 days) without refrigeration. Therefore, if we assume that all 21 pieces of jeruk sing were placed in the basket at the same time, then after 25 days, only 21 x 0.75 = 16.25 pieces of jeruk sing will remain inside the basket.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that are left after 31 candies have been eaten from a jar with 240 pieces of candy in it. We can do this by subtracting 31 from 240: 240 - 31 = 209. So there are 209 pieces of candy left in the jar. Next, we need to find out how many pieces of candy are left after 45 more candies have been eaten. To do this, we can multiply the remaining number of candies (209) by the number of candies eaten per day (45): 209 x 45 = 9265. Therefore, there will be 9265 pieces of candy left in the jar after 45 days.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that are in the jar. We know there are 44 candies in the top layer and 25 candies in the bottom layer. So, altogether, there are 69 candies in the jar (44 + 25). Now, let's assume that each piece of candy is equally divided among all the people who will share it. Therefore, if there are x people sharing the candy, each person will get an equal amount of candy, which means they will get 69/x pieces of candy per person. To find out how many people can share the candy without running out, we just have to divide the total number of candies by the number of pieces each person gets. In this case, dividing 69 by 1 = 69 people can share the candy without running out.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that are left after 25 pieces have been eaten and 5 pieces have been given away as gifts. Therefore, the remaining amount of candy is equal to 73 - (25 + 5) = 63 pieces.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy that are left after 6 days have passed since they were put in the jar. We know that there are 65 candies in the jar initially and each day, 46 candies are eaten. So, after 1 day, there will be 65 - 46 = 19 candies left in the jar. After 2 days, there will be 19 - 46 = -27 candies left in the jar (since more candies are eaten than added). Similarly, after 3 days, there will be -27 - 46 = -73 candies left in the jar, and so on. Therefore, after 6 days, there will be -73 x 6 = -438 candies left in the jar.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for each foot of length in the room. We know that the room is 7 kaki (feet) long and 14 kaki (feet) wide, so the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Room Area = Length x Width = 7 x 14 = 98 kaki squared (ft). Next, we need to convert the length of the room from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in one foot, so: Room Length (inches) = Room Length (ft) x Number of Inches per Foot = 7 x 12 = 84 inches. Now, let's calculate the number of square feet of carpet needed based on the dimensions of the room: Carpet Required = Room Area / Total Length of Room (in inches) = 98 / 84 = 1.15 square feet. Therefore, approximately 1.15 square feet of carpet will be required to cover the entire floor of the room given its dimensions.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for each foot of length in the room. We can do this by dividing the total area of the room (14 x 12 = 168 square feet) by the length of the room (14 feet). So, there are 168 / 14 = 12 square feet of carpet needed for each foot of length in the room. Now, let's calculate how much carpet is needed for 7 kaki (feet): 7 x 12 = 84 square feet. Therefore, the amount of carpet needed for 7 kaki (feet) is 84 square feet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for each foot of wall length. We can do this by dividing the total wall length (11 x 15 = 165) by the width of the carpet (10 feet). So, we need approximately 16.5 square feet of carpet for every one foot of wall length. Now, let's calculate the total area of carpet required based on the given dimensions: Total Area of Carpet = Wall Length x Number of Feet of Wall / Width of Carpet Total Area of Carpet = 165 x 3 / 10 = 247.5 square feet Therefore, the total area of carpet required is approximately 247.5 square feet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for each foot of wall. We know that there are 12 feet of wall in total, so if we divide it by 3 (since there are 3 sides of a rectangle), we get 4 square feet of carpet needed for each side of the wall. Now, let's calculate the area of the room based on the dimensions given in the problem: length = 20 feet, width = 15 feet. The area of the room is calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 20 x 15 = 300 square feet. Therefore, the total area of the room is 300 square feet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of each room. The length of each room is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet, so the area of each room is: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 square feet. Now, let's calculate the total area of all the rooms together: Total Area = Number of Rooms x Room Area = 5 x 342 = 1710 square feet. Finally, we need to subtract the area of the carpet from the total area of the floor to find out how much space is left for other things in the house: Space Left = Total Area - Carpet Area = 1710 - 200 = 1510 square feet. So, there will be 1510 square feet of space left for other things in the house after installing the carpet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many steps are there from point A (Kamaré) to point B (Ambarané). We know that Ambarané is located at a distance of 20 km away from Kamaré.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the room based on its length and width. The length of the room is 10 feet (kaki) and the width is 5 feet (pira). Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 10 x 5 = 50 square feet (ukuran). Now, let's convert this value to meters (meter) since it is required in the problem statement. We know that 1 foot (kaki) is equal to 0.3048 meters (meter), so: Area in meters = 50 / 0.3048 = 16.27 square meters (meters). Finally, we are asked how many square meters (meters) of carpet will be needed for the room. Based on the information provided earlier, we can conclude that 10 square meters (meters) of carpet will be needed for the room. Therefore, the answer is: 10 square meters (meters).;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of one square meter carpet required for the room. The length and width of the room are given as 2 meters each, so the area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = 2 x 2 = 4 square meters. Now, we need to convert this value from square meters to square feet. There are 0.11 square meters in one square foot, so: Area (in square feet) = 4 / 0.11 = 36.36 square feet. Finally, since the customer wants a 10-square-foot carpet, we can divide the total area of the room by the size of the carpet to find out how many carpets will fit in the room: Number of carpets = Total area of room / Size of carpet = 36.36 / 10 = approximately 3.64 carpets. Therefore, the customer will be able to fit approximately 3.64 carpets with a size of 10 square feet each in their 2x2 meter room.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square meters of carpet are needed for the room. We know that the length and width of the room are 18 feet x 12 feet = 216 square feet. Since each foot of carpet covers an area of approximately 0.11 square meters (based on the conversion rate of 1 foot = 0.305 meters), we can calculate the total area of the carpet needed as follows: Area of carpet = Total area of room x Number of layers of carpet So, the number of layers of carpet needed is: Layers of carpet = Total area of room / Area of one layer of carpet Therefore, the number of layers of carpet needed is: Layers of carpet = 216 square feet / 0.11 square meter/foot = 19.73 layers of carpet Now, let's move on to the next part of the question, which asks us to calculate the amount of carpet needed for each wall. To do this, we need to divide the total area of the room by the length of each wall. Based on the dimensions given in the question, the length of each wall is 4 feet + 20 feet = 24 feet. Therefore, the amount of carpet needed for each wall is: Amount of carpet needed for each wall = Total area of room / Length of each wall So, the amount of carpet needed for each wall is: Amount of carpet needed for each wall = 216 square feet / 24 feet = 9 square meters Finally, since there are four walls in the room, we multiply the amount of carpet needed for each wall by four to get the total amount of carpet needed for the entire room: Total amount of carpet needed = Amount of carpet needed for each wall x Number of walls Therefore, the total amount of carpet needed for the room is: Total amount of carpet needed = 9 square meters x 4 walls = 36 square meters In conclusion, based on the calculations above, it takes approximately 36 square meters of carpet to cover the floor of a room with dimensions 18 feet long and 12 feet wide.;;

So, let's divide the total number of Kaos into two parts:  Arkansas Kaos (A) + Texas Tech Kaos (T).  Since there are 115 Kaos from Arkansas, we can write: A = 115. Now, we need to find T, which is the remaining amount of Kaos that are not from Arkansas. Using the equation above, we can calculate T as follows: T = Total - A = 242 - 115 = 127. Therefore, there are 127 Kaos from Texas Tech.;;
Response:  We know that there are 163 Kaos in total and 89 of them were from the Arkansas side. So, we can calculate the number of Kaos from the Texas Tech side as follows: Number of Kaos from Texas Tech = Total Kaos - Number of Kaos from Arkansas = 163 - 89 = 74 Kaos. Therefore, there are 74 Kaos from the Texas Tech side.;;
Response:  We know that there are 186 Kaos in total (172 from Arkansas + 14 from Texas Tech). Now we need to find out how many Kaos are left for Arkansas after subtracting those given to Texas Tech. So, we can calculate it as follows:  Number of Kaos remaining for Arkansas = Total number of Kaos - Number of Kaos given to Texas Tech  Number of Kaos remaining for Arkansas = 186 - 14  Number of Kaos remaining for Arkansas = 172 Therefore, there are 172 Kaos remaining for Arkansas after giving 14 Kaos to Texas Tech.;;
Response:  The cost of one Razorback NGGawe is $62, and the cost of one Texas Tech jersey is $99. If there are 183 Kaos Lan items sold, then the total revenue from those sales would be: 183 x $62 = $11,546. And if there are 31 Texas Tech jerseys sold, then the total revenue from those sales would be: 31 x $99 = $3,079. So, the total revenue from all 183 Kaos Lan items plus the revenue from the 31 Texas Tech jerseys sold is: $11,546 + $3,079 = $14,625.;;
Response:  The total cost of all items is given as $67 + $165 = $232. So, the percentage increase in price from one item to another is calculated as (second item - first item) / first item x 100%. In this case, the second item is $165 and the first item is $67, so the percentage increase is ( $165 - $67 ) / $67 x 100% = 148%. Therefore, the price of each item after the increase is $67 + (148% x $67) = $67 + $95 = $162.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all Razorback merchandise that the person wants to buy:  Total Cost = Price of 1 Razorback shirt x Number of Razorback shirts + Price of 1 Razorback jersey x Number of Razorback jerseys  In this case, the person wants to buy 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys, so let's plug those numbers into the formula:  Total Cost = ($ 19 x 157) + ($ 34 x 19) = $ 192 + $ 648 = $ 840  Therefore, the person will spend $ 840 on Razorback merchandise.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all Razorback merchandise that was sold at the Texas Tech game. According to the question, 100 toko (bags) were sold, and each bag contained an average of 8 items (T-shirts or jerseys). Therefore, the total number of items sold is:

100 bags x 8 items/bag = 800 items

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all these items:

$ 86 for each razorback nggawe + $ 232 for each jersey = Total Cost

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis has saved in total. According to the question, he has saved $ 491 for 1181 weeks. Therefore, his total savings are:  $$ \text {Total Savings} = \text {Number of Weeks} \times \text {Weekly Savings} $$  In this case, the number of weeks is 1181, and the weekly savings is $ 491. So, the total savings of Lewis are:  $$ \text {Total Savings} = 1181 \times 491 = 573,091 $$  Now, let's find out how much money Lewis has spent on rent each month. According to the question, he pays $ 216 per week for rent. Therefore, his total rent expenses for 1181 weeks are:  $$ \text {Total Rent Expenses} = \text {Number of Weeks} \times \text {Weekly Rent} $$  In this case, the number of weeks is 1181, and the weekly rent is $ 216. So, the total rent expenses of Lewis are:  $$ \text {Total Rent Expenses} = 1181 \times 216 = 250,666 $$  Finally, we can calculate the amount of money Lewis has left after paying the rent. To do this, we subtract the total rent expenses from the total savings:  $$ \text {Money Left After Paying Rent} = \text {Total Savings} - \text {Total Rent Expenses} $$  Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  $$ \text {Money Left After Paying Rent} = 573,091 - 250,666 = 322,425 $$  Therefore, Lewis has $ 322,425 left after paying the rent.;;

Response:  Sakwisé is sitting in a chair and has been there for 30 minutes (mutusaké). Then he stands up and walks to the other room (arep). The distance between the two rooms is 8 feet (nglangi). Dean sees him and starts running towards him with a speed of 14 feet per minute (ambane banyu iku). How far will Ron be when Dean catches up to him?  Solution:  We know that Sakwisé walked 8 feet from his original position to reach the other room. When Dean started running towards him, he was already 8 feet away from his starting point. So, after Dean runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 14 feet per minute, he will cover a total distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 14 ft/min x 30 min = 420 feet Now, we need to find out how far Ron will be when Dean catches up to him. Since Dean ran for 30 minutes, he covered a distance of 420 feet. Therefore, Ron will be 420 - 8 = 392 feet away from his starting point when Dean catches up to him.;;

Response:  We know that Sakwisé has 15 coconuts and gives one to each of his three friends (Dean, Ron, and Banyu). So, he gave away 15 x 3 = 45 coconuts in total. Since Dean took 4 coconuts from Sakwisé, we can calculate how many coconuts Dean had before taking any by subtracting 4 from 45: 45 - 4 = 41 coconuts. Now, let's find out how many coconuts Ron took by dividing the number of coconuts Sakwisé gave him by the number of feet he is tall: 13 / 4 = 3.25 coconuts per foot. Therefore, Ron took approximately 3 + 3 = 6 coconuts.;;
Response:  We know that Sakwisé has 16 capsules of medicine and needs to take them with water. However, she only has 9 cups of water available. So we need to calculate how many capsules she can take based on the amount of water available.

Now, let's add 11 additional invitations that were not included in the initial 14 invitations. Since there are already 6 packages containing 2 invitations each, we can distribute these additional 11 invitations among the remaining 6 packages. To do this, we need to divide 11 by 6, which gives us 1.83. Therefore, we can include 1 extra invitation in each of the remaining 6 packages, making a total of 3 invitations per package. So, the number of invitations pira kanca (Carol) will receive is 3 x 6 = 18.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of crackers (krupuk) that Matthew has. According to the question, Matthew has 10 crackers in his bag. Next, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of candy (kue sing) that he has. Based on the question, Matthew has 8 pieces of candy in his bag. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money that Matthew has spent on buying these items. Since each cracker costs Rp 50 and each piece of candy costs Rp 20, the total cost of all the crackers is Rp 50 x 10 = Rp 500, and the total cost of all the candies is Rp 20 x 8 = Rp 160. Therefore, the total amount of money that Matthew has spent is Rp 500 + Rp 160 = Rp 660.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to count the number of krupuk ( crackers) that Matthew has given to each person. From the question, we know that Matthew gave 28 krupuk in total. Therefore, the number of krupuk he gave to each person is:  Number of krupuk = Total number of krupuk / Number of people = 28 / 13 = 2.  Next, we need to calculate the number of pieces of fried shallots that each person received from Matthew. According to the question, there are 15 pieces of fried shallots for every 13 people who received krupuk from Matthew. So, the number of pieces of fried shallots received by each person is:  Number of pieces of fried shallots = Total number of pieces of fried shallots / Number of people receiving krupuk = 15 x 13 = 195 pieces of fried shallots.  Finally, we add up the number of krupuk and pieces of fried shallots to get the total amount of food that Matthew distributed among the 13 people:  Total amount of food = Number of krupuk + Number of pieces of fried shallots = 2 + 195 = 197 pieces of food.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many bottles of water are left after discounting 200 bottles of water at Rp 256 per bottle. So, the calculation is as follows:  Number of bottles of water remaining = Total number of bottles of water - Discounted bottles of water  Number of bottles of water remaining = 312 bottles of water - (200 x Rp 256 per bottle)  Number of bottles of water remaining = 312 bottles of water - Rp 51,200  Number of bottles of water remaining = Rp 49,800 / Rp 256 per bottle  Number of bottles of water remaining = 197 bottles of water  Therefore, there are 197 bottles of water left after discounting 200 bottles of water at Rp 256 per bottle. Now, let's calculate how much money is saved from buying 4 bottles of soda instead of 312 bottles of water. The price of each bottle of soda is Rp 15,000. To find out how much money is saved, we can use the following formula:  Amount saved = Price of item purchased x Quantity purchased - Price of item purchased x Quantity bought  In this case, the amount saved is calculated as follows:  Amount saved = Rp 15,000 x 4 bottles - Rp 15,000 x 312 bottles  Amount saved = Rp 60,000 - Rp 46,800  Amount saved = Rp 13,200  Therefore, by buying 4 bottles of soda instead of 312 bottles of water, the customer saves Rp 13,200 in total.;;

66 classes x 8 students/class = 532 students

Next, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by all the students during their field trip. Since there are 102 students in total and they will be traveling in groups of 8, the total distance traveled can be calculated as follows:

Total distance = (Number of groups x Distance traveled per group) + (Distance traveled by remaining students)

Therefore, the total distance traveled by all the students during their field trip is:

Total distance = (102 students x 8 km/group) + (distance traveled by remaining 44 students)

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the remaining 44 students who did not go for the field trip. Since there are 22 students in each group that went for the field trip, the total distance traveled by these students is:

Distance traveled by remaining students = Total distance - (Number of groups x Distance traveled per group)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Distance traveled by remaining students = 532 km - (102 students x 8 km/group)
= 532 km - 800 km
= -268 km

So, the total distance traveled by all the students during their field trip is 532 km, and the distance traveled by the remaining 44 students who did not go for the field trip is -268 km.";;

Response:  If Haley has 9 marbles and she gives some to the boy who is playing with her, then we can say that after giving some marbles, Haley will have less than 9 marbles left. So, the number of marbles that Haley has left after giving some to the boy can be represented as x. Now, we know that the total number of marbles that the boy has is equal to the number of marbles that Haley gave him plus the number of marbles that he already had before playing with Haley, which is 9 - x. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows : 9 = x + (9 - x) Substituting the value of x from the problem statement into this equation, we get : 9 = 9 - x Solving for x, we get : x = 0 So, Haley has no marbles left after giving some to the boy.;;

If he reads for 6 hours each day, then we can calculate how many pages he will read per hour as follows: Page/Hour = Total pages / Time taken (in hours) = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per hour Now, let's find out how many chapters Frank will complete in one hour: Chapter/Hour = Total chapters / Time taken (in hours) = 24 / 6 = 4 chapters per hour Therefore, Frank will take 6 x 4 = 24 hours to finish reading his entire book of 612 pages. So, the answer is 24 hours.;;
Response:  We know that Frank has 5 books and each book contains 55 pages. So, in total, Frank has 5 x 55 = 275 pages of books. Now, we are asked how many pages Frank needs to read to finish all his books. Since he needs to read 220 dinas (days) to finish reading all the books, we can calculate the number of pages he reads per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days needed to finish reading all the books Page read per day = 275 pages / 220 days = 1.23 pages per day Therefore, Frank reads approximately 1.23 pages per day.;;
Response:  We know that Frank has 660 dinars to buy books and he wants to divide them equally among 15 books. So, we can calculate the cost of each book as follows: Cost = Number of dinars / Number of books = 660 / 15 = 44 dinars per book Therefore, the price of one book is 44 dinars.;;
Response:  We know that Frank needs 3 more books to complete his collection and he has already collected 249 books. So, we can calculate the number of books left for Frank to collect as follows: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books collected = 249 - 3 = 246 books. Therefore, Frank needs 246 more books to complete his collection.;;
Response:  We know that Frank has 66 books and needs 12 more to complete his collection. If we divide the number of books he already has (66) by the number he still needs (12), we get the total number of books available for him to collect:  So, there are 530 books available for Frank to collect.;;
"Response:  We are given that Frank has 16 days to read his favorite book. If he reads approximately 112 pages per day (which is roughly equivalent to reading one chapter in a typical novel), then he will finish reading his book in:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Number of pages read per day}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{112\text{ pages/day}}{16\text{ days}} = 7 \text{ days} $$
Therefore, Frank will finish reading his book in 7 days if he reads at an approximate rate of 112 pages per day.";;
Response:  We know that Frank has 8 favorite books and each book contains 576 pages. So, in total, Frank has read 4,320 pages (8 x 576). Now, we are asked how many times Frank has glanced at his favorite books. To find this out, we need to divide the number of pages he has read by the number of glances he takes per page. Based on the information provided, Frank takes one glance at each page, so he has glanced at all 4,320 pages once. Therefore, the answer is 4,320.;;
Response:  We know that Frank has 41 favorite books and each book contains 450 pages. To find out how many pages Frank wants to read in total, we can multiply the number of his favorite books by the number of pages in each book:  Number of pages Frank wants to read = Number of favorite books x Number of pages per book  Number of pages Frank wants to read = 41 x 450 = 18,650 pages  Now, we are asked how many days it would take Frank to read all those pages if he reads for 30 minutes every day. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of pages by the time Frank spends reading each day: Time taken to read all pages = Total number of pages / Time spent reading per day  Time taken to read all pages = 18,650 pages / 30 minutes/day = 622 days  Therefore, Frank will need approximately 622 days (or about 1 year and 9 months) to read all 41 of his favorite books if he spends 30 minutes reading each day.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has 3 favorite books and he wants to read them again. So, the number of times each book is read = Number of favorite books / Total number of books.  In this case, the total number of books is 3 x 3 = 9 books.  Therefore, the number of times each book is read = 9/3 = 3 times.  Now, let's find out how many pages are in each book. According to the passage, there are 594 pages in one book. Since Frank reads all three books, the total number of pages he reads = Number of pages in each book x Number of times each book is read.  Therefore, the total number of pages Frank reads = 594 x 3 = 1782 pages.;;
Response:  We know that Frank has 664 books to collect and he already collected 405 books from the library. So, we need to find out how many more books Frank needs to collect to get all the books he wants. To do this, we can use subtraction. Subtracting the number of books Frank already collected (405) from the total number of books he needs to collect (664), we get the remaining amount: 664 - 405 = 259. Therefore, Frank needs to collect 259 more books to get all the books he wants.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to convert $120 into Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). According to the current exchange rate, $1 USD is approximately equal to IDR 14,000.

Response:  We have 18 people in total and we want to divide them into groups of 2 or 3 people each.  To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing something into equal parts or groups.  In this case, we are dividing 18 people into groups of 2 or 3 people each.  So, how many groups can we make with 18 people?  Well, if we divide 18 by 2, we get 9 groups of 2 people each.  If we divide 18 by 3, we get 6 groups of 3 people each.  Therefore, there are 9 groups of 2 people each and 6 groups of 3 people each.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many small bunches of bananas are in one big bunch. According to the question, there are 140 clusters of bananas, and each cluster contains 187 individual bananas. So, if we divide 140 by 187, we get 0.75 or approximately 3/4. This means that there are about three-quarters of a big bunch of bananas in each small bunch. Now, let's calculate how many small bunches of bananas there are in total based on the number of big bunches given in the question. If there are 140 big bunches of bananas, and each big bunch contains about 3/4 of a small bunch, then the total number of small bunches of bananas is: 140 x 3/4 = 97 Small Bunches Of Bananas. Therefore, there are approximately 97 small bunches of bananas in the collection.;;
Response:  We have 63 jeruk (oranges) and 120 pisang (bananas). So we need to divide them into groups of equal size. For jeruk, let's divide them into 9 groups of 7 oranges each, since there are 9 x 7 = 63 oranges in total. For pisang, let's divide them into 12 groups of 10 bananas each, since there are 12 x 10 = 120 bananas in total. Now, let's check if the numbers fit nicely into these groups: Jeruk: Group 1 - 7 oranges Group 2 - 7 oranges Group 3 - 7 oranges Group 4 - 7 oranges Group 5 - 7 oranges Group 6 - 7 oranges Group 7 - 7 oranges Total number of oranges: 9 x 7 = 63 Pisang: Group 1 - 10 bananas Group 2 - 10 bananas Group 3 - 10 bananas Group 4 - 10 bananas Group 5 - 10 bananas Group 6 - 10 bananas Group 7 - 10 bananas Total number of bananas: 12 x 10 = 120 So, the answer is 63 jeruk and 120 pisang.;;
Response:  We have to divide 356 (the total number of pieces of pineapple) among 47 groups (clusters). Each cluster will get 7 pieces of pineapple (since there are 47 clusters and each cluster gets 7 pieces). Now, let's calculate how many pieces of pineapple each group will get if we divide them equally among 178 clusters. Since there are 178 clusters and each cluster gets 7 pieces of pineapple, the total number of pieces of pineapple that each cluster will get is 178 x 7 = 1236 pieces of pineapple. So, in total, there will be 356 + 1236 = 1592 pieces of pineapple collected.;;
Response:  We have 196 groups of Philip's bananas and each group contains 392 bananas in total. So, we need to divide 196 by 392 to find out how many groups there are.  Therefore, the answer is: $ \boxed{48} $ groups.;;
Response:  We have to divide 180 pieces of banana into groups of 18 people. So we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 180 pieces of banana and 18 people. To do this, we use division. Division is used when we want to divide a group or quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 180 bananas among 18 people. The formula for division is as follows:  Number divided / Number of groups = Number in each group.  In our case, we have 180 bananas / 18 people = 10 bananas per person. Therefore, we can form 10 groups of 18 people each, with each group getting 10 bananas.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many groups of bananas there are in total. According to the question, there are 87 bunches of bananas and each bunch contains 14 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is 87 x 14 = 1202 bananas. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question which asks us to distribute the remaining 290 bunches of lemons among 93 groups of bananas. To do this, we need to divide the total number of lemons (290) by the number of groups of bananas (93). So, the number of lemons each group of bananas will get is 290 / 93 = 3.15 lemons per group of bananas.;;
Response:  We have 384 jeruk and 192 pisang in total. Since we want to distribute them equally among 345 groups of jeruk and 16 groups of pineapple, we will divide each group accordingly. For jeruk, we will divide it into 345 parts (since there are 345 groups), and for pineapple, we will divide it into 16 parts (since there are 16 groups). So, the number of jeruk each group gets is:  Number of jeruk per group = Total number of jeruk / Number of groups = 384 / 345 = 10.7  And the number of pineapple each group gets is:  Number of pineapple per group = Total number of pineapple / Number of groups = 192 / 16 = 11.8  Therefore, the answer is 10.7 jeruk and 11.8 pineapple per group.;;

Response:  We have 5 cookies in total (Ibune Brenda has 3 and her friend has 2). If we divide the number of cookies that Ibune Brenda has among the 4 friends, each friend will get 1 1/4 cookies (since there are 4 friends and 5 cookies in total). Now, let's calculate how many cookies each friend gets:  Friend 1 gets 2 cookies from Ibune Brenda, so they have 2 + 1 1/4 = 3 3/4 cookies in total.  Friend 2 gets 1 cookie from Ibune Brenda, so they have 1 + 1 1/4 = 2 3/4 cookies in total.  Friend 3 gets 1 cookie from Ibune Brenda, so they have 1 + 1 1/4 = 2 3/4 cookies in total. And finally, Friend 4 gets no cookies from Ibune Brenda since they only have 1 cookie left after giving some to other friends, so they have 1 cookie in total. Therefore, the final answer is:  Cookies remaining for each friend:  Friend 1 - 3 3/4 cookies Friend 2 - 2 3/4 cookies Friend 3 - 2 3/4 cookies Friend 4 - 1 cookie;;
Response:  We have 10 cookies that are left after 9 people took some. So we have 10 - 9 = 1 remaining cookie. Now, there is 1 person who wants to take some of the remaining cookie. How many cookies will they get? Well, if they take all of the remaining cookie, then there won't be any left for anyone else. So let's say they take half of the remaining cookie, which is equal to 1/2 x 1 = 0.5 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies that the last person will get is 0.5 cookies.;;
Response:  If we have 14 cookies and each cookie has 50% of chocolate filling, then we can calculate the total number of chocolate fillings as follows: Total number of chocolate fillings = Number of cookies x Percentage of chocolate filling in each cookie So, the total number of chocolate fillings would be: Total number of chocolate fillings = 14 x 0.5 = 7 Therefore, there are 7 chocolate fillings in total.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of permanganate (Potongan) that Frank has. According to the question, Frank has 42 pieces of permanganate. Now, let's find out how many grams of permanganate are in each piece. The question states that one piece of permanganate (Potongan) contains 0.1 grams of permanganate. Therefore, the total amount of permanganate in all 42 pieces is: 0.1 g x 42 pieces = 4.2 grams. Next, we need to convert this amount from grams to milligrams (mg). There are 1,000 mg in 1 gram, so: 4.2 g x 1,000 mg/g = 420 mg. Finally, we can divide the total amount of permanganate by the number of pieces to get the average amount of permanganate in each piece: Average amount of permanganate in each piece = Total amount of permanganate / Number of pieces = 420 mg / 42 pieces = 10 mg per piece.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in 26 weeks. There are 7 days in one week, so there are 26 x 7 = 182 days in 26 weeks. Now, we have to calculate how many hours are there in 182 days. There are 24 hours in one day, so there are 182 x 24 = 4352 hours in 182 days. Finally, we have to convert these hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so there are 4352 x 60 = 266,120 minutes in 182 days. Therefore, the answer is 266,120 minutes.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 33 pieces of permethat Frank has. Then, we need to find out how many pieces of permethat he can give away without running out. We know that each piece of permethat costs Rp 100, so if Frank gives away all his 33 pieces, he will have spent a total of Rp 3300 (33 x 100). Now, let's see how much money Frank will have left after giving away 24 pieces of permethat. If he gives away 24 pieces at Rp 100 each, he will have spent a total of Rp 2400 (24 x 100). So, Frank will have Rp 800 left after giving away 24 pieces of permethat (Rp 3300 - Rp 2400 = Rp 800). Finally, we want to know how many pieces of permethat Frank will have left after giving away 9 pieces. If he has Rp 800 left and he gives away 9 pieces at Rp 100 each, he will spend a total of Rp 900 (9 x 100) and will be left with Rp 700 (Rp 800 - Rp 900 = Rp 700). Therefore, Frank will have 7 pieces of permethat left after giving away 9 pieces.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of permits that Frank has. According to the question, Frank has 11 packets of permits, and each packet contains 20 pieces of permits. Therefore, the total number of pieces of permits that Frank has is:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of permits} = \text {Number of packets of permits} \times \text{ Number of pieces of permits in each packet} $$
= 11 packets $\times$ 20 pieces/packet = 220 pieces

Now, we need to calculate the number of pieces of permits that Gadhadhara has. According to the question, Gadhadhara has 22 packets of permits, and each packet contains 5 pieces of permits. Therefore, the total number of pieces of permits that Gadhadhara has is:

$$ \text {Total number of pieces of permits} = \text {Number of packets of permits} \times \text{ Number of pieces of permits in each packet} $$
= 22 packets $\times$ 5 pieces/packet = 110 pieces

Therefore, the difference between the number of pieces of permits that Frank has (220) and the number of pieces of permits that Gadhadhara has (110) is:

$$ \text {Difference} = \text {Frank's number of pieces of permits - Gadhadhara's number of pieces of permits} $$

Number of cases that can be solved with 5 questions = Total number of cases / 3  Number of cases that can be solved with 5 questions = 50 / 3  Number of cases that can be solved with 5 questions = 16.67 cases (approximately) Therefore, approximately 16.67 cases of triangular prisms can be solved using 5 questions each.;;
Response:  The volume of regular soda in 67 bottles is V1 = 67 x 0.5 L = 33.5 L.  The volume of diet soda in 9 bottles is V2 = 9 x 0.5 L = 4.5 L.  To find out how much more water there is in the diet soda than in the regular soda, we subtract their volumes: V2 - V1 = 4.5 L - 33.5 L = -29 L. So, there are -29 liters less water in the diet soda than in the regular soda.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of both types of soda that Ing has purchased:

Volume of regular soda = 22 x 0.5 L = 11 L
Volume of diet soda = 61 x 0.5 L = 30.5 L

Now, let's find out how much more volume there is in the diet soda compared to the regular soda:

Difference in volume = Volume of diet soda - Volume of regular soda
= 30.5 L - 11 L
= 20 L

So, there are 20 liters more of diet soda than regular soda that Ing has purchased.";;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of all the bottles of soda that Duwe has. The volume of each bottle is 30 botols (or 30 x 0.5 liters = 15 liters). Therefore, the total volume of all the bottles is:

Total Volume = Number of Bottles x Volume per Botol
= 30 botols x 15 liters/botol
= 450 liters

Now, let's calculate the number of apples needed to fill the remaining space in the container after placing the bottles inside it. We know that the capacity of the container is 41 liters (as stated in the problem), and we have already calculated the volume of the bottles as 450 liters. So, the difference between these two quantities gives us the amount of space left in the container after placing the bottles:

Space Left in Container = Capacity of Container - Total Volume of Bottles
= 41 liters - 450 liters
= -409 liters

Finally, since we want to find out how many apples can fit in this remaining space, we divide the negative value obtained above by the volume of one apple:

Number of Apples = Space Left in Container / Volume of One Apple
= -409 liters / 0.5 liters (volume of one apple)
= -818 apples

Therefore, Duwe needs 818 apples to fill the remaining space in the container after placing the bottles inside it.";;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of regular cola and diet cola separately. For regular cola, there are 79 bottles with a volume of 500 ml each, so the total volume is:

$$ V_{col} = 79 \times 500 = 39,500 $$

For diet cola, there are 42 bottles with a volume of 500 ml each, so the total volume is:

$$ V_{diet} = 42 \times 500 = 21,000 $$

Now, let's find out how much more water is needed for diet cola compared to regular cola:

$$ \text{More water needed} = V_{diet} - V_{col} $$

Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:

$$ \text{More water needed} = 21,000 - 39,500 = -18,500 $$

So, there is a shortage of $18,500 liters of water needed for diet cola compared to regular cola.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of both types of sodas: Diet soda (83 botols) + Regular soda (12 botols) = Total volume = 95 botols. Now, let's find out how many grams of sugar are in each type of soda: Diet soda contains 40 grams of sugar per liter, while regular soda contains 60 grams of sugar per liter. To convert liters to milliliters, we divide the value in liters by 1000: 40 grams/liter x 1000 ml/liter = 40,000 mg/liter for Diet soda and 60 grams/liter x 1000 ml/liter = 60,000 mg/liter for Regular soda. Next, we multiply the number of grams of sugar per liter by the total volume of each type of soda to get the total amount of sugar in each: For Diet soda: Total amount of sugar = 40,000 mg/liter x 95 botols = 3700 mg For Regular soda: Total amount of sugar = 60,000 mg/liter x 95 botols = 5700 mg Finally, we subtract the total amount of sugar in the Diet soda from the total amount of sugar in the Regular soda to determine which one has more sugar: 5700 mg - 3700 mg = 2000 mg difference Therefore, there is a 2000 mg difference between the two types of soda in terms of sugar content.;;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toko Kelontong Duwe has 17 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of Diet Coke. So, the total number of bottles is 17 + 9 = 26 bottles. Now, let's calculate the number of bottles of Diet Coke using the information provided in the question. We are given that there are 29 bottles of Coca-Cola, and each bottle contains 350 ml of soda. Therefore, the total volume of Coca-Cola is 29 x 350 ml = 101,000 ml. Since Diet Coke has a smaller volume than regular soda (300 ml), we can deduce that the number of bottles of Diet Coke is half of the total number of bottles of Coca-Cola. Therefore, the number of bottles of Diet Coke is 26 / 2 = 13 bottles. So, the answer is 13 bottles of Diet Coke.;;
"Response:  If we have 19 bottles of regular soda (let's call it X) and 60 bottles of diet soda (let's call it Y), then the total amount of soda is:
X + Y = 19 + 60 = 79
Now, let's find out how much each bottle of soda costs:
Cost per bottle = Total cost / Number of bottles
For regular soda: Cost per bottle = 79 / 19 = Rp 4.26
For diet soda: Cost per bottle = 79 / 60 = Rp 3.58
So, if you buy 19 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda, the total cost will be:
Total cost = 19 x Rp 4.26 + 60 x Rp 3.58 = Rp 1,334.80 + Rp 2,168.00 = Rp 3,502.80
Therefore, buying 19 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda would cost more than buying only 60 bottles of diet soda.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of all 72 bottles of regular soda: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 10 cm x 5 cm x 30 cm = 1500 cubic centimeters (or 1.5 liters). Next, we need to calculate the volume of 32 Diet Soda bottles: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 10 cm x 5 cm x 25 cm = 625 cubic centimeters (or 0.625 liters). Finally, we add these two volumes together to get the total volume of both types of soda: Total Volume = Regular Soda + Diet Soda = 1500 + 625 = 2125 cubic centimeters or 2.125 liters. Therefore, there are 78 apples in a basket if each apple takes up 2.125 liters of space.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of all the bottles of soda that Duwe has. The volume of each bottle is 36 apel (or 36 x 100 = 3600 ml). Therefore, the total volume of all the bottles is 3600 ml + 3600 ml +... + 5400 ml = 27600 ml. Now, let's calculate the volume of liquid that Liyan needs to fill in her new bottle. She needs to fill it with soda from Duwe's bottles, so she will take an equal amount of soda as Duwe has. Therefore, the volume of liquid that Liyan needs to fill in her new bottle is also 27600 ml / 3 = 9200 ml. So, Liyan needs to fill 9200 ml of soda into her new bottle.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of all 30 bottles of cola drink. The volume of each bottle is 28 botols (biasa) + 28 botols (diet). Therefore, the total volume of all 30 bottles is: Total Volume = (28 x 30) = 860 botols. Now, let's find out how many liters are in 860 botols. We know that there are 1 liter in 1000 botols, so: Number of Liters = Total Volume / 1000 = 860 / 1000 = 0.86 liters. Finally, we can see that 0.86 liters of cola drink will be left after pouring 28 botols of soda into 28 botols of soda diet.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of the 4 bottles of regular soda that Kelontong has. The volume of each bottle is 750 ml (as stated in the question). Therefore, the total volume of the 4 bottles is: Volume = 4 x 750 ml = 3000 ml Now, let's find out how much less water is needed for the Diet Coke. According to the question, 1 liter of Diet Coke is equivalent to 2 liters of regular soda. So, if Kelontong wants to make 4 liters of Diet Coke using the 4 bottles of regular soda he has, he will need: Volume of Diet Coke = 4 x 2 liters = 8 liters To summarize, Kelontong needs 8 liters of water to make 4 liters of Diet Coke.;;

57 bottles x 0.5 L/bottle = 28.5 L regular soda
Next, we need to calculate how many liters of diet soda are in 26 bottles:

26 bottles x 0.33 L/bottle = 8.42 L diet soda
Finally, we add these two amounts together to get the total volume of both types of soda:

28.5 L + 8.42 L = 37 L
Therefore, there are 37 liters of soda in the container.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total volume of all 81 bottles of regular soda: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 81 x (60 x 3) = 25600 cubic centimeters. Now, let's calculate the volume of 60 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of light soda: For diet soda, Volume = Length x Width x Height = 60 x (4 x 3) = 960 cubic centimeters. For light soda, Volume = Length x Width x Height = 60 x (4 x 3) = 960 cubic centimeters. Finally, we can compare the volumes of the three types of soda using the following formula: Difference = Regular soda - Diet soda - Light soda = 25600 - 960 - 960 = 23780 cubic centimeters. Therefore, if you fill each bottle with soda to the brim, the difference in volume between the three types would be approximately 23780 cubic centimeters.;;
Response:  Firstly, we have 49 bottles of regular cola and 40 bottles of diet cola. So, in total, we have 49 + 40 = 89 bottles of cola. Now, out of these 89 bottles, there are 6 bottles of light cola. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular cola is 89 - 6 = 83 bottles.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace in one day. According to the question, there were 317 guests at the palace on that particular day. Now, let's assume that each guest spends an average time of 2 hours inside the palace. Therefore, the total number of minutes spent by all the visitors inside the palace can be calculated as follows: Total minutes = Number of visitors x Time spent per visitor Total minutes = 317 x 120 (since each hour is equal to 60 minutes) Total minutes = 38,040 minutes Now, let's convert this value from minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so: Total seconds = Total minutes x Number of seconds in one minute Total seconds = 38,040 x 60 Seconds = 2,282,400 seconds Finally, we divide the total number of seconds by the number of visitors to get the average time spent by each visitor inside the palace: Average time spent per visitor (in seconds) = Total seconds / Number of visitors Average time spent per visitor (in seconds) = 2,282,400 / 317 = 7,135 seconds So, on average, each visitor spent around 7,135 seconds or approximately 117 minutes inside the Buckingham Palace on that particular day.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year (or 366 days in a leap year). Next, we need to determine how many people visited the palace each day. According to the question, there were 703 visitors in total, and they visited the palace for an average of 2 hours per visit. Therefore, the number of visitors per day is:  Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors x Average time spent at the palace / 24 hours in a day  Number of visitors per day = 703 x 2 hours/visit / 24 hours/day = 18 visitors per day Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors who visited the palace in one month. Since there are 30 days in April, the total number of visitors in April is:  Total number of visitors in April = Number of visitors per day x Number of days in April  Total number of visitors in April = 18 x 30 = 540 visitors in April Finally, let's calculate the total number of visitors who visited the palace in one year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of visitors in a year is:  Total number of visitors in a year = Total number of visitors in April x Number of months in a year - 1  Total number of visitors in a year = 540 x 12 - 1 = 6,570 visitors in a year Conclusion: Based on the calculation above, there were approximately 6,570 visitors who visited the palace in a year.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace in one day. According to the question, there were 100 guests at the palace every day. So, the total number of visitors in one year is: 100 x 365 = 36,500 visitors per year. Now, let's find out how many of them are tourists. The question states that 666 people visit the palace from other countries. Therefore, the number of tourists who visited the palace in one year is: 36,500 - 666 = 35,834 tourists per year.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace in one day. According to the question, there were 132 guests at the palace in one day. Therefore, the total number of visitors per day is 132. Next, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per hour. To do this, we divide the total number of visitors per day by 24 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day). So, the average number of visitors per hour is 132 / 24 = 5.5 visitors per hour. Finally, we multiply the average number of visitors per hour by the number of days that the palace was open to visitors during the year (which is 327 days) to get the total number of visitors who visited the palace throughout the year. Therefore, the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace throughout the year is 5.5 visitors per hour x 327 days = 1,899,500 visitors.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days between each visit to Buckingham Palace. According to the question, Rachel visited Buckingham Palace 45 times in total. Therefore, the number of days she spent at Buckingham Palace is: 45 x 1 day = 45 days. Next, we need to calculate the total number of visitors who have ever visited Buckingham Palace. According to the question, there are 829 people who have visited Buckingham Palace so far. Therefore, the total number of visits to Buckingham Palace is: 829 x 1 visit = 829 visits. Finally, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visits by the number of days Rachel spent at Buckingham Palace: 829 visits / 45 days = approximately 18.36 visitors per day.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of visitors who visited the palace in one day. According to the question, there were 71 paintings in the palace, and each painting had 557 viewers on average per day. Therefore, the total number of visitors per day is:

$$ \text {Total number of visitors per day} = \frac{\text{Number of paintings } x \text{ Average number of viewers per painting}}{24} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Total number of visitors per day} = \frac{71 x 557}{24} = 36,900 \text{ visitors per day} $$

Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the palace in 57 days. We can multiply the total number of visitors per day by the number of days:

$$ \text {Total number of visitors in 57 days} = \text {Total number of visitors per day} \times \text {Number of days} $$

Substituting the value obtained earlier, we get:

$$ \text {Total number of visitors in 57 days} = 36,900 \times 57 = 2,093,500 \text{ visitors} $$

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, approximately 2,093,500 people visited the palace in 57 days.";;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 661 paintings in the palace of Buckingham. Now, let's calculate how many visitors can fit in the palace at one time. According to the question, the maximum capacity of the palace is 600 people. So, if all 661 paintings are visited simultaneously, it means that each visitor will see only 600/661 = 0.9 (or approximately 90%) of the total number of paintings in the palace. Therefore, the approximate number of visitors who can visit the palace at one time is 90%.;;
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there were 92 guests at the palace for tea. Then, we are asked how many of them visited the State Rooms. Based on this information, we can calculate the number of visitors to the State Rooms as follows: Number of visitors to the State Rooms = Total number of guests x Percentage of guests who visited the State Rooms So, if 419 out of 92 guests (or 45%) visited the State Rooms, then the number of visitors to the State Rooms is: Number of visitors to the State Rooms = 92 x 45% = 41.9 Therefore, there were approximately 41.9 visitors to the State Rooms.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace in one day. According to the question, there were 512 guests who attended a tea party at the palace and 471 people who visited the palace during the day. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the palace in one day is:  Total Number of Visitors = 512 + 471 = 983 people. Now, let's calculate the average number of visitors per hour based on the total number of visitors in one day. To do this, we divide the total number of visitors by the time period (in hours) that they visited the palace: Average Number of Visitors per Hour = Total Number of Visitors / Time Period = 983 / 8 = 121 visitors per hour. Finally, let's calculate the number of visitors who visited the palace in 89 days using the average number of visitors per hour: Number of Visitors in 89 Days = Average Number of Visitors per Hour x Time Period = 121 visitors per hour x 89 days = 10,699 visitors.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace in one day. According to the question, there were 705 guests who attended the tea party at the palace that day. However, not all of them may have visited the palace itself, as some might have only attended the tea party and then left. So, let's assume that out of these 705 guests, only 50% actually visited the palace (352 guests).  Next, we need to calculate the average number of visitors per hour. To do this, we can divide the total number of visitors by the time period during which they visited the palace (in hours). Based on the question, the duration of the visit was 45 minutes (or 0.75 hours). Therefore, the average number of visitors per hour is: Number of visitors / Time taken for visit = 352 visitors / 0.75 hours = 46.8 visitors per hour  Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors who visited the palace over a period of 245 days. We can multiply the average number of visitors per hour by the number of hours in a day (24), and then multiply the result by the number of days (245): Total number of visitors x Hours in a day x Days = 46.8 visitors/hour x 24 hours/day x 245 days = 1,339,600 visitors Overall, based on the calculations above, it is estimated that approximately 1,339,600 people visited Buckingham Palace over a period of 245 days.;;

"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of yarn needed for all the patterns in the list:

Sabanjur ing daftar cek yaiku lilin kanggo nempel bulu lan warna kanggo nglukis = 49 g

Now, let's calculate the number of grams of yarn needed for each pattern:

1. Kanggo Nempel Bulu - 30 g
2. Warna Kanggo Nglukis - 20 g

So, the total amount of yarn needed for these two patterns is:

Total amount of yarn needed for Kanggo Nempel Bulu and Warna Kanggo Nglukis = (30 + 20) x 2 = 60 g

Now, let's subtract the amount of yarn needed for these two patterns from the total amount of yarn needed for all the patterns:

Remaining amount of yarn needed for other patterns = Total amount of yarn needed for all patterns - Total amount of yarn needed for Kanggo Nempel Bulu and Warna Kanggo Nglukis = 49 - 60 = -11 g

Therefore, there are 11 grams less than the total amount of yarn needed for all the patterns.";;
Response:  We have to calculate how much of each color is needed for the total amount of 57 grams and then subtract that from the total weight of the yarn to find out how much is left over for the 22 grams of Liyane yarn.  So, first we need to calculate the amount of each color needed:  For the red yarn, we need 57/10 = 5.7 grams (since there are 10 colors in total).  For the blue yarn, we need 57 - 5.7 = 51.3 grams (since there are 9 colors after red).  For the green yarn, we need 51.3 / 4 = 12.8 grams (since there are 4 shades of green).  And so on...  Therefore, the total amount of yarn needed is 5.7 + 51.3 + 12.8 +... = 110.8 grams.  Now, since we only have 353 grams of yarn available, we can see that we don't have enough yarn to make all of these colors.  So, the remaining amount of yarn after making all the colors is 353 - 110.8 = 242.2 grams.  Finally, since we want to use 22 grams of Liyane yarn, we can subtract that from the remaining amount of yarn to get the total amount of yarn left over: 242.2 - 22 = 220.2 grams.;;

Response:  If there are 3 cookies in one pack and Sammy eats 21 cookies in total, then he must have eaten 7 packs of cookies (21 / 3 = 7).;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of cookies that Sampey has made in total. According to the question, he has made 15 permens and each permen contains 52 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Sampey has made is: 15 x 52 = 780 cookies. Now, let's find out how many cookies are left after giving some to Jumla. According to the question, Jumla received 26 kannthongs (which is equal to 26/4=6.5 permens) from Sampey. Since each permen contains 52 cookies, the number of cookies that Jumla received is: 6.5 x 52 = 324 cookies. So, the number of cookies that are left after giving them to Jumla is: 780 - 324 = 456 cookies.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of cookies that each person has eaten. According to the question, there are 14 people who have eaten cookies, and each person has eaten an average of 28 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by all 14 people is:

Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash thrown away by Tukang Pos Kudu in one day is: 5 x 30 = 150 pieces of trash.  Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the trash thrown away by Tukang Pos Kudu in one day. Based on the question, each piece of trash weighs approximately 0.5 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the trash thrown away by Tukang Pos Kudu in one day is: 150 x 0.5 = 75 kg.  Finally, we need to calculate the distance traveled by Tukang Pos Kudu while throwing away the trash. According to the question, he walked for 25 meters after throwing each piece of trash. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Tukang Pos Kudu while throwing away the trash is: 25 x 150 = 3750 meters.;;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one bag. According to the information provided, each bag can hold up to 10 pieces of trash. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one bag is:

10 pieces of trash per bag x Total number of bags = Total number of pieces of trash that can fit in all bags

Next, we need to determine how many bags are needed to dispose of all the trash from the entire area. Based on the information provided, there are 20 garbage piles in the entire area, and each pile contains about 50 pieces of trash. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash in the entire area is:

Total number of pieces of trash in the entire area = Number of garbage piles x Average number of pieces of trash per pile

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of pieces of trash in the entire area = 20 garbage piles x 50 pieces of trash per pile = 1000 pieces of trash

Now, we divide the total number of pieces of trash in the entire area by the number of bags that can be used to dispose of them:

Number of bags needed to dispose of all the trash in the entire area = Total number of pieces of trash in the entire area / Number of pieces of trash that can fit in one bag

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of bags needed to dispose of all the trash in the entire area = 1000 pieces of trash / 10 pieces of trash per bag = 100 bags

Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, it would take approximately 100 bags to dispose of all the trash from the entire area.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pages in all the letters received from Kedah. There are 20 letters in total, and each letter has 4 pages (front and back). Therefore, the total number of pages is:  Number of letters x Number of pages per letter = 20 x 4 = 80 pages.  Next, we need to determine how many pages are missing from the original 100 pages. Since there are 80 pages remaining after deducting the pages sent to Kedah, the difference between the original 100 pages and the remaining 80 pages is:  Original pages - Remaining pages = 100 - 80 = 20 pages.  Finally, we need to divide the total number of pages that were sent to Kedah by the number of pages that are missing to find out how many copies of each page were made:  Total pages sent to Kedah / Missing pages = 80 / 20 = 4 pages.  So, there are 4 pages for each missing page.;;

So, the average length of each word in the sentence is 29 / 8 = 4 letters.";;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of bricks needed for each layer of the wall. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the wall perimeter (in meters) with the thickness of each brick (in meters). For example, if the length and width of the wall perimeter are both 10 meters, then the total number of bricks needed for each layer would be: Number of bricks = Length x Width x Thickness = 10 x 10 x 0.5 = 500 bricks Now, let's assume that there are 32 layers of bricks in total. Therefore, the total number of bricks needed for the entire wall is: Total number of bricks = Number of layers x Number of bricks per layer = 32 x 500 = 16,000 bricks Finally, we need to subtract the number of bricks that have already been used to build the foundation from the total number of bricks needed. According to the question, 20 omas (units of measurement) of sand were used to fill the foundation, which is equivalent to 0.2 meters depth of sand. Assuming that each meter of sand requires 0.5 bricks to compact it, we can calculate the number of bricks required for compaction as follows: Number of bricks for compaction = Depth of sand x Number of bricks per meter = 0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1 meters = 100 bricks So, the remaining number of bricks needed for the entire wall after compaction is: Remaining number of bricks = Total number of bricks - Number of bricks used for compaction = 16,000 - 100 = 15,900 bricks;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one layang (a unit of measurement for volume). According to the question, each layang can hold up to 30 pieces of trash. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one layang is 30.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of layangs required to fill up 19 griya (a unit of measurement for volume) of trash. To do this, we divide the volume of trash (in layangs) by the volume of each layang (which is 30 pieces of trash per layang). So, the total number of layangs required to fill up 19 griya of trash is 19 / 30 = 6.67 layangs. Since we cannot have a fraction of a layang, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 6 layangs.  Finally, we multiply the total number of layangs by the number of blocks in Satunggal Blok Pinten-Pinten Potongan Surat Sampah Ingkang Kedah (which is 78 blocks), and we get the total volume of trash that needs to be disposed of, which is 6 x 78 = 468 layangs.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of bricks needed for each layer based on the height of the wall and the thickness of the brick. For example, if the height of the wall is 10 meters (m), then the number of bricks needed per layer can be calculated as follows: Number of bricks = Height of wall x Thickness of brick / Length of brick Where the length of a standard brick is usually around 20 cm or 0.2 meters (m). So, in this case, the calculation would be: Number of bricks = 10 m x 0.0254 m / 0.2 m = 400 bricks Now, let's assume that there are 8 layers of bricks in total, with each layer being 1 meter (m) high. Therefore, the total number of bricks needed for all 8 layers can be calculated as follows: Total number of bricks = Number of bricks per layer x Number of layers = 400 bricks x 8 layers = 3200 bricks Finally, since you mentioned that there are 55 blocks of landfill, we need to subtract the number of bricks used for the walls from the total number of bricks needed. So, the remaining number of bricks after constructing the walls can be calculated as follows: Remaining bricks = Total number of bricks - Number of bricks used for walls = 3200 bricks - 400 bricks = 2800 bricks Therefo;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of trash that Tukang Pos Kudu needs to collect from each block. According to the question, there are 4 blocks in total, and each block has 81 houses. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that Tukang Pos Kudu needs to collect is:  Number of pieces of trash = Total number of houses x Number of pieces of trash per house  In this case, the number of pieces of trash per house is not given in the question, so let's assume it's 1 piece. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that Tukang Pos Kudu needs to collect is:  Total number of pieces of trash = 4 x 81 = 324 pieces of trash. Now, we need to divide the total number of pieces of trash among the 12 omahs (or households) in the saben blok (block). Since there are 12 omahs in the saben blok, we can divide the total number of pieces of trash by 12 to get the average number of pieces of trash for each omah:  Average number of pieces of trash per omah = Total number of pieces of trash / Number of omahs in the saben blok  Average number of pieces of trash per omah = 324 pieces of trash / 12 omahs = 27 pieces of trash per omah. So, Tukang Pos Kudu needs to collect 27 pieces of trash per omah in the saben blok.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one layang (a unit of measurement for volume). According to the question, each layang can hold up to 4 pieces of trash. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash that can fit in one layang is 4.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of layangs needed to fill 16 blocks of trash. Based on the question, there are 16 blocks of trash in total, and each block has 4 layangs worth of space. Therefore, the total number of layangs needed to fill all 16 blocks of trash is 16 x 4 = 64 layangs.  Finally, we need to calculate the total weight of all the trash that can be collected based on the capacity of each layang. According to the question, each layang can hold up to 0.5 kg of trash. Therefore, the total weight of all the trash that can be collected is 64 layangs x 0.5 kg/layang = 32 kg.;;

Now, we are asked how many endogs Rebecca will have if she adds 6 more endogs to her collection. So, after adding 6 more endogs, Rebecca will have 38 endogs (32 + 6 = 38). Therefore, the answer is 38.;;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has collected 3 sets of endogs from 3 groups. She has 4 marbles and 15 endogs in total. To find out how many endogs each group has, we can divide the number of endogs she has (15) by the number of groups she has (3). So, each group has approximately 5 endogs (15 / 3 = 5).;;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has collected 6 sets of endangered animals from different groups. Each set contains 18 animals and takes up 72 liters of space. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of animals Rebecca has in each group as follows: Group 1: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Group 2: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Group 3: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Group 4: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Group 5: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Group 6: 18 x 72 = 1304 animals Since there are 6 groups in total, the total number of animals Rebecca has is 6 x 1304 = 7224 animals. So, the pira (or pirate) group that Rebecca will assign these animals to is Group 6.;;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has collected 99 bananas and 9 endogs from Group 3. If we subtract the number of endogs she got from Group 3 (9) from the total number of bananas she collected (99), we get 80 bananas left. Now, if we add the number of marbles she received from Group 3 (27), we get a total of 107 items collected by Rebecca. Therefore, the correct answer is 107.;;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has collected 20 large stones and 6 small stones. If we want to calculate how many more small stones she needs to collect to make up for the difference in size between the large and small stones, we can use the following formula: (number of small stones) = (total number of stones - number of large stones). In this case, the total number of stones is 20 + 6 = 26 stones. So, if Rebecca wants to make up for the difference in size between the large and small stones, she needs to collect 26 - 6 = 20 more small stones. Therefore, Rebecca needs 20 more small stones to complete her collection.;;
Response:  We know that Rebecca has collected 20 groups of endhogs and each group contains 5 marbles and 12 endhogs. So, in total, Rebecca has 20 x 5 = 100 marbles and 20 x 12 = 240 endhogs. Therefore, the ratio of marbles to endhogs is 100 : 240 or 1 : 2.;;

"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many boys are in each group. From the question, we know that there are 644997 boys in total and they are divided into three groups of different ages. The first group consists of 201 boys aged between 6-8 years old, the second group has 323 boys aged between 9-11 years old, and the third group contains 500 boys aged between 12-14 years old. Therefore, the number of boys in each group is as follows: Group 1 (ages 6-8): 201; Group 2 (ages 9-11): 323; Group 3 (ages 12-14): 500. Next, we need to calculate the percentage of boys who are in each age group. To do this, we divide the number of boys in each age group by the total number of boys in all three groups. Using the numbers provided earlier, we get: Percentage of boys in Group 1 = (201/644997) x 100% = 0.03%; Percentage of boys in Group 2 = (323/644997) x 100% = 0.05%; Percentage of boys in Group 3 = (500/644997) x 100% = 0.08%. Finally, we can calculate the total number of boys in each age group by multiplying the percentage of boys in each group by the total number of boys in all three groups. Using the percentages calculated above, we get: Total number of boys in Group 1 = 0.03% x 644997 = 192; Total number of boys in Group 2 = 0.05% x 644997 = 322; Total number of boys in Group 3 = 0.08% x 644997 = 502.

From the given information, we know that the machine can produce 9 units per minute and each unit requires 44 seconds to complete. Therefore, the time taken to produce 1 unit is: Time = Number of units / Seconds per unit = 9/0.44 = 20.9 minutes So, if the machine works continuously without any breaks, it will take approximately 20.9 minutes to produce 1 unit of product.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total time taken for all three tasks (Task A, Task B and Task C) combined. We know that each task takes 5 minutes to complete, so the total time taken is: Total Time = 3 x 5 minutes = 15 minutes. Now, we need to find out how much time is spent waiting for the machine to digest the food. From the question, we know that the machine can digest one batch of food in 10 minutes. So, the time spent waiting for the machine to digest the food is: Waiting Time = 10 minutes / 3 batches = 3.33 minutes per batch. Since there are 8 batches in total, the total waiting time is: Total Waiting Time = 8 x 3.33 minutes = 27 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken for all three tasks plus waiting time is: Total Time = 15 + 27 = 42 minutes.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of minutes that the machine works in one shift. We know that there are 9 hours in a shift and each hour has 60 minutes, so: Total minutes per shift = 9 x 60 = 540 minutes Secondly, we need to find out how many minutes the machine works during an 8-hour day. Since the machine works for 2 hours every day, we can calculate the total minutes worked as follows: Total minutes per day = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes Finally, we need to convert these minutes into seconds. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so: Total seconds per shift = 540 x 60 = 32,400 seconds Total seconds per day = 120 x 60 = 7,200 seconds Therefore, the pira menit (minutes per second) of the machine is: Pira menit = Total seconds per day / Number of days worked Per day = 7,200 / 1 = 7,200 seconds/day;;
"Response:  If we want to know how many minutes it takes for the machine to produce 3 pieces of product in 1 minute and 4 pieces of product in 8 minutes, we can use the following calculations:
Minutes per piece = Total time / Number of pieces produced
= 60 seconds/minute x (Number of pieces produced) / (Time taken to produce one piece)
For 3 pieces of product in 1 minute:
Minutes per piece = 60 seconds/minute x (3 pieces) / (1 minute) = 20 seconds/piece
For 4 pieces of product in 8 minutes:
Minutes per piece = 60 seconds/minute x (4 pieces) / (8 minutes) = 5 seconds/piece
Therefore, the machine takes approximately 20 seconds to produce one piece of product and 5 seconds to produce four pieces of product.";;

Now, let's calculate how much money Piyush spent playing the game in a year: $1.15 x 365 = $407.75 per year. Finally, since he played the game for 5 years, the total amount of money he spent playing the game is: $407.75 x 5 = $2,038.75.;;
Response:  We know that there are 382 dollars in total and it has to be divided among 44 people for 10 days. So, we can calculate the amount of money each person will get per day as follows: $382 / 44 = $8.5 per day Now, let's find out how much Dolanan got. Since he received $8.5 per day x 10 days = $85 from the total amount of $382. Therefore, Dolanan got $85.;;
Response:  We know that there are 120 dollars in total and it has to be divided among 20 days of carnival. So, we can calculate the amount per day as follows: $120 / 20 = $6 per day Now, let's find out how much each person will get if there are 66 people participating in the carnival. $6 x 66 = $392 So, each person will get $392.;;
Response:  We know that there are 325 people who paid $154 each and 114 people who paid $57 each for the carnival. So in total, we have: 325 x $154 = $50,900 + 114 x $57 = $6,482 = $57,382 Now, if we subtract the amount paid by 57 people from the total amount collected, we get: $57,382 - $6,482 = $50,900 Therefore, the remaining amount after the 57 people left the carnival is $50,900.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in Wong Tuwa's class, which is given as 174. Then, we are asked to find out how many students have completed their homework, which is equal to the number of students who did not attend the extra-curricular activity. Therefore, we can deduce that the number of students who attended the extra-curricular activity is equal to the total number of students minus the number of students who completed their homework. So, we can write the equation as follows: Number of students attending extracurricular activity = Total number of students - Number of students completing homework Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of students attending extracurricular activity = 174 - x Where x represents the number of students who completed their homework. Since there were 521 students in total, and only 30 students completed their homework, we can now solve for x: Number of students attending extracurricular activity = 174 - 30 = 144 Therefore, there were 144 students who attended the extra-curricular activity.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school which is given as 177. Then, we are asked to find out how many students can be accommodated in each classroom. Based on this information, we can determine the maximum number of classes that can be conducted in the school. Finally, we are asked to find out how many classes will fit in one room. So, let's break it down mathematically: Total Number of Students = 177 Classes per Room = 44 (based on the information provided) Maximum Number of Classes = Total Number of Students / Classes per Room = 177 / 44 = 4 Therefore, there can be 4 classes in one room.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many steps Jero can take in one minute. According to the question, Jero can walk 919 meters in 6 minutes, which means he can walk 153 meters per minute (919/6). Now, let's calculate how many steps Jero can take in one minute based on his walking speed of 153 meters per minute. We know that there are 100 centimeters in one meter, and there are 1000 millimeters in one meter. Therefore, there are 100000 centimeters in one kilometer (1000 x 1000 = 100000). Since Jero walked 919 meters in 6 minutes, he covered a distance of 919 / 6 = 153.14 meters per minute. To convert this distance into steps, we divide it by Jero's stride length of 1307 centimeters (which is the average length of an adult male's stride). So, the number of steps Jero takes in one minute is: 153.14 meters / 1307 centimeters = approximately 112 steps per minute.;;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many steps it takes for someone to walk from point A (1218 kaki) to point B (849 kaki). We can do this by dividing the distance between the two points by the length of one step. So, if each step is equal to 30 cm, then: Distance = 849 - 1218 = 469 cm / 30 cm/step = 15.63 steps Secondly, we need to find out how many times Piyambakipun needs to take these steps in order to cover the entire distance of 17 pinten malih. Therefore, we divide the total number of steps taken by Piyambakipun (17 pinten malih) by the number of steps he took per trip (15.63 steps): Number of trips = 17 pinten malih / 15.63 steps/trip = 11.11 trips Finally, we multiply the number of trips by the number of steps taken per trip to get the total number of steps Piyambakipun took: Total steps = 11.11 trips x 15.63 steps/trip = 170.93 steps;;

Response:  We know that there are 7 cats in total and they play with a ball for 12 minutes. So, we can calculate the number of times each cat plays with the ball as follows:  Number of times each cat plays with the ball = Total time playing with the ball / Number of cats.  In this case, the total time playing with the ball is 12 minutes, and the number of cats is 7. Therefore, the number of times each cat plays with the ball is:  Number of times each cat plays with the ball = 12 minutes / 7 cats = 1.71 (approximately) cats per minute.;;
"Response:  We have 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in a bowl. If we assume that each fish takes up space equally (which may not be true), then the total volume of water taken up by all the fish is:

Volume of water = Number of fish x Volume per fish
= 16 + 71 = 87

Now, let's calculate the volume of one goldfish:

Volume of one goldfish = Volume of water / Number of goldfish
= 87 / 16
= 5.43 cubic meters

So, the volume of one goldfish is approximately 5.43 cubic meters.";;

Response:  If Adam can clean 11 action figures in one sink, and he has 4 drawers with 40 compartments each, then we need to calculate how many compartments Adam can fill with action figures.  There are 40 compartments per drawer x 4 drawers = 160 compartments total. So, if Adam fills one compartment with an action figure, he can fill 160 compartments with action figures. Therefore, the answer is 160.;;
Response:  If Adam can take pictures of 10 action figures in his bedroom, and each figure takes up 2 square feet of space (as mentioned earlier), then we have: Total area = Number of figures x Area per figure = 10 x 2 sq ft = 20 sq ft Now, if Kamaré can fit 8 action figures in his room, then the total area available for all 8 figures is: Total area = Number of figures x Area per figure = 8 x 2 sq ft = 16 sq ft Subtracting the total area available for all 8 figures from the total area available for Adam gives us the remaining space that Adam cannot use: Remaining space = Total area - Total area available for 8 figures = 20 - 16 = 4 sq ft Therefore, there are 4 square feet of space left over after Kamaré has placed 8 action figures in his room.;;
Response:  We know that there are 8 action figures and 10 drawers in the room. Since each drawer can hold 4 items, we have:  Number of items that can be stored in each drawer = 10 (drawers) x 4 (items per drawer) = 40 items Total number of items that can be stored in all the drawers = 40 (total items) / 8 (action figures) = 5 items Therefore, there are 5 items that Adam can store in each of the 8 drawers.;;

Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are in each class. From the question, we know that there are 270 students in total and they are divided into two classes - Class A and Class B. The number of students in Class A is 135, and the number of students in Class B is 135. Now, let's calculate the number of students in each class who can sit in one row. We know that the length of one row is 6 meters, so the number of students who can sit in one row is 6 / 0.8 = 7.5 students per row. Therefore, the total number of students who can sit in one row is 7.5 x 135 = 975 students. Next, we need to find out how many rows are available in the hall. According to the question, the hall has a capacity of 400 students, which means that it has 400 / 7.5 = 56 rows. Finally, we can calculate the number of students who can sit in each row by dividing the total number of students by the number of rows available. So, the number of students who can sit in each row is 975 / 56 = 17 students.;;
