"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

Elena has 7 gumballs and Jack has 6 gumballs. Elena puts 3 gumballs in her pocket and 2 gumballs on the table. Now, Elena has 4 gumballs left.
Jack also puts some gumballs in his pocket, but we are not told how many he put there. However, we know that Jack has 4 gumballs left after putting them in his pocket.

So, to find out how many gumballs Elena and Jack have left, we need to add the number of gumballs they have left. For Elena, it is 4 + 4 = 8 gumballs. For Jack, it is 4 + x (where x is the number of gumballs Jack put in his pocket) = 10 gumballs.

Now, let's compare the number of gumballs Elena and Jack have left:

Elena has 8 gumballs left, and Jack has 10 gumballs left. Therefore, there are more gumballs left with Jack than with Elena."

Response:  If Jack had 6 balls in his park and he gave 3 of them to Ella, then there were 6 - 3 = 3 balls left with Jack in the park.
"Response:  The time spent on English and Chinese lessons is not directly proportional to the cost difference between the two languages. While it may seem that learning Chinese would require more hours due to its complexity, there are other factors at play here. Here's a breakdown of why the cost difference might be higher for Chinese than English:

1. Script: Chinese has a complex writing system with thousands of characters, each requiring memorization and practice. In contrast, English uses an alphabetic script, making it easier to learn and write. This difference in script complexity can account for some of the cost difference.
2. Grammar: Chinese grammar is vastly different from English, with no verb conjugation, no gendered nouns, and a subject-verb-object word order. These differences make Chinese more challenging to learn and teach, which can contribute to a higher cost.
3. Cultural context: China has a rich cultural heritage, and understanding this culture is essential for effective language learning. This includes learning about customs, traditions, and historical events, all of which can add to the overall cost of instruction.
4. Instructor qualifications: Qualified instructors who specialize in teaching Chinese often have advanced degrees or certifications in linguistics, cultural studies, or related fields. Their expertise and experience can command higher fees, contributing to the cost difference between English and Chinese lessons.
5. Limited availability: Depending on where you live, finding qualified Chinese teachers might be more difficult than finding English tutors. This limited supply and demand dynamic can drive up prices, especially if you're looking for private lessons.
6. Supplementary materials: Learning Chinese often requires additional resources such as textbooks, flashcards, and online courses. These supplementary materials can also contribute to the overall cost of instruction.
7. Time commitment: Finally, the time commitment required for Chinese lessons can be greater than for English lessons. As you mentioned earlier, Rayan spends 6 hours per day studying English and only 2 hours per day studying Chinese. This disparity in time devoted to each language can impact the total cost over time.

In summary, while the number of hours spent on English and Chinese lessons may differ, the cost difference between the two languages is influenced by various factors beyond just the amount of time spent on each."
"Response:  The time spent on English and Chinese lessons is not directly comparable because they are different subjects with different levels of difficulty and importance in the curriculum. However, if we assume that both subjects have equal weightage in terms of academic value, then we can compare the total hours spent on each subject.

According to the information provided, Rayan spends 6 hours per day on English lessons and 7 hours per day on Chinese lessons. Therefore, the total hours spent on English lessons = 6 x 24 = 144 hours per month. Similarly, the total hours spent on Chinese lessons = 7 x 24 = 168 hours per month.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the two amounts:

Difference = Total hours spent on Chinese lessons - Total hours spent on English lessons
= 168 hours - 144 hours
= 24 hours

So, Rayan spends 24 additional hours per month on Chinese lessons compared to English lessons."
Response:  If he spends 3 hours every day studying English and 2 hours every day studying Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours per day on language learning. Therefore, if he spends 4 hours per day on language learning, then he spends 1 hour per day on Chinese language learning.

"Response:  The answer to the question is 16 hours.

Explanation:

Rayan spends 7 hours studying English every day, which means he spends a total of 49 hours (7 x 7) on English studies in one week.
He spends 2 hours studying Chinese and 4 hours studying Spanish, respectively.
Therefore, Rayan spends a total of 55 hours (49 + 2 + 4) on language studies in one week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, Rayan spends a total of 55 x 7 = 385 hours on language studies in a month."
"Response:  The answer is 16 hours.

Explanation:

Rayan spends 2 hours learning English every day, which means he learns for a total of 30 days (2 hours/day x 30 days).
He spends 5 hours learning Chinese every day, which means he learns for a total of 150 days (5 hours/day x 30 days).
Therefore, Rayan spends more time learning Chinese than English by a margin of 120 days (150 days - 30 days)."
"Response:  The man spends 3 hours every day learning English and Chinese. If he spends 2 hours daily on English language learning, then he spends how many hours on Chinese language learning?

Solution:

Let the time spent on Chinese language learning be 'x' hours per day.

From the question, we know that the man spends a total of 3 hours on both languages each day. So, the total time spent on both languages is:

3 hours = x + 2 hours (as he spends 2 hours on English)

Now, we can solve for 'x':

x = 3 - 2 = 1 hour

So, the man spends 1 hour on Chinese language learning each day."

Response:  Total number of campers who had fever in the morning = 13 x 2 = 26. Total number of campers who had fever in the afternoon = 49 x 2 = 98. Therefore, a total of 124 campers had fever during the entire day (26 + 98).
Response:  The number of campers who went in the morning and afternoon is given as 44 and 39 respectively. Therefore, there are 7 more campers who went in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  Total number of campers who were sick in the morning = 48. Total number of campers who were sick in the afternoon = 49. Therefore, there are more campers who were sick in the afternoon than in the morning by 1 person.
Response:  Total number of campers who were sick = (33 + 34) x 2 = 67 campers.
Response:  Total number of campers who did not take a morning walk = 59 - 21 = 38. Therefore, 38 campers did not take a morning walk.
Response:  The number of campers who were roaming in the afternoon is equal to the number of campers who were roaming in the morning minus the number of campers who were resting in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is 40 (29 - 26).
"Response:  Total number of campers who rode bicycles = 4 x 41 = 164
Total number of campers who roamed = 26
Therefore, a total of 180 campers (164 + 26) participated in the activities."

Response:  If Rakesh picked up 4 seeds from his tree and there were 7 seeds in the tree at the beginning of the experiment, then there are still 3 seeds left on the tree after Rakesh picked up the 4 seeds.
Response: राहेल ने उठाया 4 सेब, फिर उसने 2 सेब बचाया हैं, जोदा हैं की राहेल ने उठाया 6 सेब (4 + 2) उठाया हैं).
Response:  The number of apples that are not ripe is 2. So, the total number of apples on the tree is 7 (3 ripe + 4 not ripe).
Response:  The tree has produced 2 seeds in the first year and 3 seeds in the second year. So, if there are 7 seeds on the tree now, then the number of seeds that were planted by Rakesh is 6 (2 + 3 = 6).
Response:  The number of apples in the tree is 8 (6 + 2).
Response:  PE = 3 + (2 x 27) = 3 + 54 = 57 सेब हैं.
Response:  The number of apples on the tree is 9 (7 + 2).
Response: पेड़ पर 6 सेब हैं!
Response: 52 - 2 = 50 सेब हैं!
Response:  The number of apples on each tree is given by the equation: x = 3x + 2. If there were initially 3 seeds in each seedling and now there are 9 apples on each tree, then the total number of apples produced so far is: A = (3x + 2) × 3 = 15x + 6.
Response:  Rakesh has 4 trees and he picked 7 seeds from each tree. So, the total number of seeds he picked is 4 x 7 = 28 seeds. Now, there are 29 seeds on the trees, including the ones Rakesh picked. Therefore, Rakesh did not pick any additional seeds.
Response:  The number of balls that Dog kicked is 13.
Response:  If Ed had 45 marbles and gave away 11 of them, then he has 34 marbles left. If Doug had 10 more marbles than Ed, then Doug has 44 marbles. So, the difference between Ed's and Doug's number of marbles is 10.
Response:  If there were 6 more bulbuls in the field than the number of ducks, then there are 108 (6 + 7) bulbuls and 22 - 7 = 15 ducks in the field now.
Response:  If there were 5 more bulbuls in the field than the number of balls that Ed had thrown away, then the number of balls that Doug had at the start would be equal to the difference between the total number of bulbuls and the number of balls that Ed threw away. Therefore, if there were 5 more bulbuls in the field than the number of balls that Ed threw away, then Doug had 22 balls (i.e., 5 more bulbuls) at the start.
Response:  The ratio of the number of balls possessed by Ed to that possessed by Doug is 3:1. So, for every 3 balls possessed by Ed, Doug possesses 1 ball. Therefore, if Ed has 9 balls and Doug has 27 balls, then Ed has 9/3 = 3 balls more than Doug.
Response:  The number of balls that were in Ed's favor after the game was 17 - 29 = -12. So, there were 12 more balls in Doug's favor than Ed's.
"Response:  The answer is 24.
Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Ed had 19 balls in his bag before he threw some of them away during the game. Now, there are 8 more bullets than balls. So, the total number of balls Ed has now is 24 (8 + 16)."
Response:  If Ed had 30 marbles in his pocket and gave away 21 of them to the boys playing near the pond, then he has 9 marbles left with him. If there were 91 bulbs in the bag that Ed was carrying, then he must have had at least 60 more bulbs than the number of marbles he had (i.e., 91 - 9 = 82). So, Ed had a total of 82 + 9 = 91 bulbs in his bag.
Response:  If Ed had 12 balls and gave away 5 to his friend, then he has 7 balls left. If he played a game of cricket in the ground with 20 squares and lost all his balls, then he has no balls left. So, if Ed had 17 balls initially, then he has none now.
"Response:  If Sophia gave the suggestion to 408 students to eat in a particular way and 42 students suggested that they should not eat in that way, then out of those who did not eat in that way, how many more students were there than those who ate in that way?

Solution:
Let's assume the number of students who ate in the suggested way is x. Then, the number of students who did not eat in that way is 408 - x.

Since 42 students suggested not eating in that way, we can say that the number of students who did not eat in that way is at least 42.

So, the difference between the number of students who ate in that way and the number of students who did not eat in that way is:
x - (408 - x) = 42

Simplifying the equation, we get:
366 > x > 4

Therefore, there are more than 366 students who did not eat in the suggested way."
Response:  If 479 students gave the suggestion to eat aloo (potato) and 489 students suggested to eat mennu (a type of dish made with wheat flour), then the number of students who suggested a vegetable dish was 479.

Response:  If 457 students gave suggestions for the menu, and 63 of them preferred to have rice instead of baked beans in their meal, then out of these 63 students, how many students gave suggestions for rice as an alternative to baked beans?
Response:  If 166 students gave the suggestion to eat rice and 182 students suggested eating rotis, then 166 + 182 = 348 students gave suggestions.
Response:  If Sophia gave a suggestion to the students regarding different types of food items that they could bring for their picnic, and if 324 students suggested bringing rice, 374 students suggested bringing bread, and 128 students suggested bringing tomatoes, then how many students did not suggest any food item?
Response:  If Sophia gave suggestions to the students regarding different types of food that they could bring for lunch, and if out of 257 students, 120 suggested bringing bread, 97 suggested bringing tomatoes, and 40 suggested bringing both bread and tomatoes, then how many more students suggested bringing bread than those who suggested bringing tomatoes?
Response:  If Sophia gave the suggestion to cook vegetables in different ways to 144 students and 467 students suggested to put peas in menu, while 79 students suggested to add tomatoes, then how many more students suggested to add potatoes than those who suggested to add peas?
"Response:  If Sophia gave a suggestion to the students regarding the menu for the canteen, and if out of 228 students, 337 suggested adding beans in the menu, 23 suggested adding tomatoes, and remaining 190 did not suggest anything, then how many more students suggested adding beans than tomatoes?

Solution:
Let's first calculate the total number of suggestions made by all the students.
Total suggestions = Suggestions made by 337 students + Suggestions made by 23 students + Suggestions made by remaining 190 students
= 337 + 23 + 190
= 650

Now, let's find out the number of suggestions made by the students who suggested adding beans.
Number of suggestions made by bean-suggesting students = Number of students who suggested adding beans (337) - Number of students who did not suggest adding beans (190)
= 337 - 190
= 147

Similarly, we can find out the number of suggestions made by the students who suggested adding tomatoes.
Number of suggestions made by tomato-suggesting students = Number of students who suggested adding tomatoes (23) - Number of students who did not suggest adding tomatoes (190)
= 23 - 190
= -167

So, there are 147 more suggestions made by students who suggested adding beans than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
Response:  If Sophia had given suggestions to the students for 66 different food items and 450 students had participated in the activity, then out of these 450 students, 38 students had suggested beans as an alternative to rice, while the remaining 412 students did not suggest any alternative.
"Response:  If Sophia gave a suggestion to the students regarding the type of food they should eat during their meals in the mess, and if out of 218 students, 351 students agreed with her suggestion, then how many students did not agree with her suggestion?

Solution:
Let's assume that the number of students who agreed with Sophia's suggestion is x.

Total number of students = 218
Number of students who agreed with Sophia's suggestion = 351

So, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + 351 = 218

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 160

Therefore, 160 students did not agree with Sophia's suggestion."
Response:  If Sophia gave a suggestion to the students regarding the menu for the canteen, and if out of 269 students who gave their suggestions, 330 suggested adding aloo (potato) in the menu, 76 suggested adding tomato, then how many more students suggested adding aloo than tomato?

Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 868 - 281
= 587

Therefore, there are 587 students in the school."
Response:  The number of students in the school is 700. If there are more boys than girls, then the number of boys is 142 more than the number of girls. So, the total number of students in the school is 700 + (142 - x), where x is the number of girls. Therefore, the answer is 700 + 142 = 842.

Solution:
Let's analyze the given information:

J Zachary did 15 push-ups today in his gym class. David did more than J Zachary, exactly 39 push-ups. John did fewer push-ups than David, exactly 9 less.

Now, let's compare J Zachary and John:

J Zachary did 15 push-ups, and John did 9 push-ups less than him, so J Zachary did 24 push-ups (15 + 9).

Therefore, J Zachary did more push-ups than John."
Response:  If David has given 30 extra push-ups today in his gym class, and he had already done 37 push-ups before that, then Jazzeri (the other person) has also done 37 push-ups.
Response:  If David made 56 push-ups today in his gym class and he made 38 push-ups yesterday, then the total number of push-ups that David has made so far is 56 + 38 = 94 push-ups.
"Response:  If Jaison has 17 less push-ups than David and they both did the same number of crunches, then David did __________ crunches.

Answer: 34 + (62 - 17) = 51"
Response:  If David made 36 push-ups yesterday but today he did only 33 in a jim class, then David did less than 58 push-ups today if Jazzeri did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches.
Response:  If David made 27 push-ups yesterday but only 7 today in the jim class, then David has done fewer push-ups than yesterday by a margin of 19 (27 - 7 = 19). So, if Jazzeri did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, Jazzeri has done more crunches than push-ups by a margin of 12 (17 - 5 = 12).

"Response:  The man has 14 cups of rice and 6 cups of wheat. He had already given 5 cups of rice earlier. Now he needs to measure out more than 3 cups of rice to make 1 cup of atta (flour). So, the number of cups of rice he needs is:

14 - 5 = 9

So, he needs 9 cups of rice to make 1 cup of atta."
Response:  The man has already given 4 cups of atta to his wife, and now he wants to know how many more cups of rice she will need if she consumes 9 cups in total. So, the answer is 5 cups (9 - 4 = 5).
"Response:  If Mary had already eaten 2 cups of rice before she started cooking, and she needs to make 6 more cups of rice for a total of 8 cups, then how many cups of water will she need to add to the pot?

Answer: Mary will need to add 4 cups of water to the pot to make 6 additional cups of rice."
Response:  If the person had already drunk 3 cups of tea before and now wants to drink another cup, then he will have to add 4 more cups of water (since there are 4 cups in a liter) to make another cup of tea. So, the total number of cups of water that the person has added is 4 + 3 = 7 cups.
"Response:  The number of cups of tea that Mary has already drunk is 3 cups. If she wants to make 6 more cups of tea using the same amount of tea leaves as before (i.e., 11 cups), then how many tea leaves will she need in total?

Answer: Mary will need a total of 17 tea leaves (6 x 2 = 12 + 5)."
Response:  If the person had already drunk 2 cups of tea before and now wants to drink another cup, then they will have drunk a total of 3 cups of tea (2 + 1 = 3). So, the answer is 3 cups.
Response:  The man has already given 3 cups of atta and 62 cups of chini. To find out how many more cups of atta he needs to give, we need to subtract the amount he has already given from the total amount required (9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups). So, the man needs to give 6 more cups of atta.
"Response:  The man has already given 10 cups of atta and 2 cups of chini. Now he needs to give how many more cups of chini?

Solution:
The man has already given 10 cups of atta, so the total amount of atta he has given is 10 + 10 = 20 cups.
He also gave 2 cups of chini earlier, so the total amount of chini he has given is 2 + 2 = 4 cups.
Now, the man needs to give 14 - 2 = 12 cups of chini."
Response:  The man has already given 11 cups of atta (flour) and now he needs to give more. Let's say he wants to give 3 more cups of atta. So, the total amount of atta he will have given is 14 cups (11 + 3).
Response:  The number of cups of atta (whole wheat flour) that can be added to the mixture after it has been mixed with 2 cups of chini (sugar) and 80 cups of namak (rock salt), assuming that the proportion of chini and namak remains the same as before, is 5 cups.
Response:  The man has already given 2 cups of atta to his wife before he started counting the remaining amount. So, out of the total 12 cups of atta, he has given away 2 cups, leaving him with 10 cups. Now, if he wants to give his wife more than 7 cups of namak (salt), he will have to take some from the remaining atta. Therefore, the answer is 3 cups of atta (10 - 7 = 3).
"Response:  The man has already given 5 cups of atta (wheat flour) and now he needs to calculate how many more cups of chini (sugar) he needs to give to the woman. Let's assume that 1 cup of sugar is equal to 40 grams.

So far, the man has given a total of 30 cups of sugar (8 x 4 = 32 grams), which is less than the required amount of 80 grams. Therefore, the man needs to give an additional 50 grams of sugar (80 - 32 = 50 grams)."
Response:  The man has already given 2 cups of tea to his friend and now he wants to give him more. He has 12 cups of tea in total and needs to know how many more cups he can give to his friend. So the answer is 10 cups (12 - 2 = 10).
Response:  The man has 12 cups of rice and 8 cups of wheat. He wants to distribute them equally among 3 friends. If he has already given 4 cups of wheat to one friend, how many cups of wheat will he have left to give to the other two friends?
Response:  The man has 18 caps of tea and wants to know how many more cups he can make with the remaining 32 cups of water. He has already poured two cups of water into the teapot before answering the question. To find out how many more cups he can make, we need to divide the total number of cups by the number of cups left in the teapot after pouring two cups. In this case, there are 30 cups left in the teapot (32 - 2 = 30). So, the man can make 30 more cups of tea.
Response:  The man has already consumed 11 cups of tea and now he wants to know how many more cups of tea he can have if he has 5 cups of tea left. So, the answer is 5 cups of tea.
Response:  If the person had already drunk 3 cups of tea before and now wants to drink another 5 cups, then they will have drunk a total of 8 cups of tea (3 + 5 = 8).
Response:  If the person had already drunk 3 cups of tea before answering the question and wants to drink 13 cups more, then he/she will have to drink 10 cups (13 - 3 = 10) more.
Response:  The woman has already given 7 cups of atta and 60 cups of chini to the man. To find out how many more cups of atta she needs to give him, we need to subtract the number of cups he has already received from the total amount he wants (i.e., 6 cups). So, the woman needs to give the man 53 more cups of atta (6 - 7 = 53).
Response:  The man has already consumed 12 cups of tea and 10 cups of milk. To find out how many more cups of each he needs to drink, we need to subtract the number of cups he has already drunk from the total amount he wants to consume. In this case, he wants to drink 11 cups of tea and 9 cups of milk, so he needs to drink an additional 3 cups of tea (11 - 12) and 4 cups of milk (9 - 10).
Response:  The man has already drunk 6 cups of tea before the question was asked, and he needs to drink another 4 cups (for a total of 10 cups) to fulfill his promise.
Response:  The man has already given 4 cups of atta to his wife, and now he wants to know how many more cups of atta she can have if she consumes more than 1 cup of chini every day. So, the answer is 3 cups (14 - 4 = 10) more cups of atta.
Response:  The man has already drunk 2 cups of tea before he started counting the sugar. He has counted that there are 7 cups of tea left and 4 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of tea he can drink now, we need to subtract the number of cups of tea he has already drunk from the total number of cups of tea left. In this case, he has drunk 2 cups of tea, so the number of cups of tea left is 7 - 2 = 5 cups of tea. Therefore, he can drink 5 more cups of tea now.
Response:  The man has already given 12 cups of atta (wheat flour) and now he needs to calculate how many more cups of chini (rice) he needs to give. Let's assume that the ratio of atta to chini is 3:4. So, if the man has already given 12 cups of atta, then he needs to give 8 more cups of chini (since 3 x 8 = 24, which is greater than 12). Therefore, the answer is 8 cups of chini.
Response:  The man has already drunk 4 cups of tea and needs to drink another 6 cups (for a total of 10 cups).
Response:  The man has already given 10 cups of tea to his friend and now he wants to know how many more cups of tea he can give him without exceeding the total amount of 12 cups that his friend had asked for. So, the answer is 2 cups (12 - 10 = 2).
Response:  If 60 birds of different species migrate to warmer climates during winter, then the number of bird families that migrate to colder climates for breeding would be approximately _______________ times more than the number of bird families that migrate to warmer climates for wintering.
Response:  If 7 bird families migrate to warmer regions during winter and there are 87 bird species that migrate to colder regions during summer, then the number of bird species that migrate in opposite directions (i.e., from warm to cold regions) is 80.
Response:  According to the passage, initially there were 20 bird families living in the mountains. However, due to the changing climate, only 14 of these families could survive and adapt to the new conditions, while 6 did not survive or migrate to other areas. Therefore, the answer is (B) 14.
Response:  If 23 birds from Africa and 37 birds from Asia migrate to the Himalayas, there will be a total of 60 bird families in the Himalayas.
Response:  If 42 birds from Africa migrate to Asia and 31 birds from Africa migrate to Europe, then the number of birds that migrated to Asia is greater than the number of birds that migrated to Europe by 11 birds (42 - 31 = 11).
"Response:  If 47 birds of a particular species migrate from Africa to Europe and 94 birds of the same species migrate from Asia to Europe, then how many more birds of that species migrated from Asia than from Africa?

Answer: Let's assume the number of birds that migrated from Africa is x. Then, the number of birds that migrated from Asia is x + 94 (since 94 birds migrated from Asia). Therefore, the difference between the number of birds that migrated from Asia and Africa is x - 47 = (x + 94) - 47. So, the answer is x - 47."
"Response:  If 18 bird families migrate to Africa and 80 bird families migrate to Asia, then the number of birds that migrated to cold regions (Siberia) would be:

Let's assume there are x birds in total that migrated to Siberia.

From the given information, we know that 38 bird families migrated to Africa and 80 bird families migrated to Asia, so the total number of birds that migrated to warm regions is:

x + 38 = 180

Similarly, the total number of birds that migrated to cold regions (Siberia) is:

x + 80 = 260

So, the number of birds that migrated to Siberia is:

x = 260 - 180 = 80

Therefore, 80 birds from a total of 260 birds migrated to Siberia."
"Response:  If there are currently 87 bird families living in the mountains and if 18 new bird families have joined them, then the total number of bird families living in the mountains would be:

So, the answer is (B) 126."
Response:  According to the passage, there are 49 bird families that migrate to warmer countries during winter and 59 new bird families that fly south for the winter. Therefore, in total, there were 108 bird families that migrated to warmer places during winter.
Response:  If there were 27 families of birds living in the mountain and they migrated to warmer climates during winter, then out of these 27 families, how many families would have survived if they had started their migration from the base of the mountain?
Response:  If there were 86 bird families living in the mountainous region and 45 of them migrated to warmer climates during winter, then the number of birds that remained behind would be 41 (86 - 45).
Response:  If 35 birds of a family migrate to Asia and 62 birds of another family migrate to Africa, then the number of birds that migrated to Asia is how much more than the number of birds that migrated to Africa?
Response:  The number of bird families that were present in the mountainous region was 15. Out of these, 4 families had their nests in the mountains, while 11 families migrated to warmer regions during winter. Therefore, there were a total of 70 birds in the mountainous region during summer and 85 birds in the warmer regions during winter.
Response:  If the box contained 253 pennies and Polly kept some of them until the end of the school year, then at the end of the school year, Polly had 70 pennies left. Therefore, during the school year, Polly had a total of 183 pennies (253 - 70 = 183).
Response:  The box contained 177 pencils.
Response:  The number of pencils that Polly had at the beginning of the year was 440. During the school year, she gave away 111 creative writing critiques to her friends while keeping 329 pencils for herself. Therefore, the number of pencils that Polly had left at the end of the year was 329.
Response:  The number of pents that Poll kept is 213. Therefore, the number of pents that he gave away is 16. So, the answer is 197.
Response:  The boy gave his friends 571 creative writing critiques during the school year while keeping 161 for himself. Therefore, he gave his friends 410 more creative writing critiques than he kept for himself.
Response:  The boy gave more than 110 pencils to his friends during the school year while he kept only 412 pencils for himself. So, he gave away 738 - 110 = 628 pencils.
Response:  If Polly had 332 pencils and gave away 558 pencil creations during the school year, then she has 558 - 332 = 226 pencils left.
Response:  If Polly had only 492 pencils and gave away 52 of them during the school year, then she had 492 - 52 = 440 pencils left at the end of the year.
Response:  The number of pents that were given to Polly on her birthday is 521. Out of these, only 154 pens were used by the students in their school yearbook. Therefore, the remaining 367 pens (521 - 154) did not get used or were not given to anyone.
Response:  The number of pents that Poll had in his box at the end of the school year was 391. To find out how many more pens than rabdoms he had, we need to subtract the number of rabdoms from the total number of pents. In this case, there were 38 rabdoms, so Poll had 391 - 38 = 353 more pents than rabdoms.
Response:  The box contained 601 pents and 406 rubbers. If the school year ended in June and only 336 students passed, how many more rubbers were there than pens?
"Response:  The number of pents that Poll could have received on his birthday are as follows:

* If he had 315 friends and each friend gave him one penny, then Poll would have received 315 pennies.
* If he had 291 friends and each friend gave him two pennies, then Poll would have received 582 pennies (291 x 2 = 582).

Therefore, the total number of pennies that Poll could have received on his birthday is 315 + 582 = 897 pennies."
Response:  If the box contained 267 pencils and Polly used 231 of them during the school year, then she gave away 36 pencils to her friends.
Response:  The box contained 168 poles and 240 rods. Therefore, the number of poles that were left in the box after the student gave away 523 pieces is 168 - 523 = -355 poles.

Response:  The man spent a total of $7 on chocolates (2 dollars for one bar and 3 dollars for the other). So, he spent $7 on chocolates.
Response:  The amount of money that Dan's friend gave him is 5 dollars. So, the total amount of money that Dan has now is $4 + 5 = $9.
Response:  The cost of the chocolate bar is $2, so Dan spent a total of $5 on the chocolate bar and the drink ($4 + $1 = $5).
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan has is $4. He bought 10 chocolates at a price of $1 each, so he spent a total of $10. Therefore, Dan has $4 - $10 = $3 left.
Response:  Each chocolate bar costs $1, so the total cost of 2 chocolate bars is $2 (2 x $1 = $2).
Response:  $ 2
Response:  The man spent $ 4 to buy a chocolate and $ 2 to buy a candy. Therefore, he spent a total of $ 6 on sweets (chocolate + candy).
Response: 23 (115 - 78 = 23)
Response:  The number of books Polly had at the beginning was 249. After selling 137 books in a garage sale, she had 105 books left. So, initially, Polly had 249 - 137 = 112 books.
"Response:  The number of books sold in the garage sale was 40 (not 62). Let's see why:

After selling some books and giving 35 to his friend, he had 62 - 35 = 27 books left. So, he sold 40 books in total."
Response:  The man had 50 books in his possession before he sold some of them in a garage sale. After the sale, he was left with 151 books. Therefore, he bought 101 books during the garage sale.
"Response:  If there were initially 2 books in the box and after some time, 150 new books were added to it, then the number of books in the box now is:

2 + (150 x 58) = 2 + 840 = 842

So, the person has sold 842 books."
Response:  If there were initially 21 books in the store and after some sales, 42 new books were bought, then the number of books available for sale at present is 15 (initially 21 - sold books). So, the person has sold 42 - 15 = 27 more books than the initial number of books they had.
"Response:  If the person had 71 books before selling some of them in a garage sale and then bought 38 new books, how many books does he have now?

Solution:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The person had 71 books initially.
* He sold some of these books in a garage sale, but we don't know how many he sold. Let's assume he sold half of his initial collection, which is 71 / 2 = 35 books.
* After selling some of his books, he bought 38 new books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books the person has:
Total books = Initial books + Books bought after selling = 35 + 38 = 73

So, the person has 73 books now."
Response:  The number of books sold in the garage sale was 42.
Response:  The number of books and pens sold in the garage sale = 82 + 14 = 96.
Response:  If Polly had 136 books in the beginning and sold 27 of them, then she has 109 books left with her. So, she sold 29 books (136 - 27 = 109).
Response:  The number of books that Polly had after selling 39 books to her friend is 68.
Response:  The number of books that Gaurav sold in his second sale is 13 + 23 = 36 books.

Response:  If Robbin's hair was originally 17 inches long and he cut off some of it, then the length of his remaining hair is 13 inches. So, he cut off 4 inches (17 - 13 = 4) of his hair.
Response:  If Robin had cut Rob's hair 20 inches shorter before cutting it to 10 inches, then Rob's hair was originally 30 inches long (20 + 10 = 30).
Response: 15 इंच
"Response:  If Robbin's hair was 19 inches long before and it grew by 2 inches after that, then his new length of hair would be:

New length = Old length + Growth
= 19 inches + 2 inches
= 21 inches

So, now Robbin's hair is 21 inches long."
Response:  If Robin cuts Robyn's hair so that it is now 13 inches long, and before he started cutting it was 14 inches long, then after he finishes cutting it, Robyn's hair will be 13 - 14 = 1 inch shorter than it was originally.
Response:  The length of Robin's hair was 14 inches before it was cut. After the cut, its length became 8 inches. Then, he cut another 20 inches off. So, the length of his hair now is 8 + 20 = 28 inches.
Response: 12 × 53 = 634 बोतल के ढक्कन हैं।
Response:  If there are 21 bottles in a row of Deni's collection and he sees some more bottles in the park, then the number of bottles he saw in the park is equal to the number of bottles in Deni's collection minus the number of bottles he already has.

Response:  The number of packets Dan had before he went to the park is 66. After he played there for some time and returned home, he found that he had 16 more packets in his bag. So, the total number of packets Dan had after playing at the park is 66 + 16 = 82 packets.
"Response:  The number of bottles of Danine is 39.

Explanation:

From the information given in the passage, we know that Danine brought 46 packs and 50 bottles to the park. After she left, there were 21 bottles and 52 packs remaining in the collection. Therefore, the total number of bottles Danine had was 46 + 50 = 96. Subtracting the number of bottles she left behind (21), we get the answer as 96 - 21 = 75. So, the number of bottles Danine had is 75."
Response:  The number of boxes and bottles in the Danish park is decreasing by 2 each time a box or bottle is taken out of the park. Therefore, after 31 boxes and 9 packs have been removed from the park, there will be 31 - 2 = 30 boxes left in the park. Similarly, after removing 31 bottles, there will be 31 - 2 = 29 bottles left in the park.
Response:  The number of bottles that Danine has is now 12 more than the number of packets she had initially. So, if she had 25 packets initially, then she has 37 packets now (12 + 25). Therefore, Danine has 37 bottles and 25 packets.

Response:  Jack has 23 aadhar (7 from the station + 15 from his own place).
Response:  The number of apples that Jack has is 18. There are 13 more apples in the village than in Jack's basket. So, the total number of apples in the village is 18 + 13 = 31 apples.
Response:  The number of hills in Jack's possession is 8 more than the number of steps in Steve's possession. Therefore, there are 8 + 3 = 11 hills in Jack's possession.
Response:  The number of apples that Jack has is less than the number of apples that Jill has by 3. So, Jill has 15 apples and Jack has 12 apples.
Response:  Jack has 7 acre and the station has 16 acres of land. So, Jack has 9 more acres than the station.
Response:  Jill के पास 8 आड़ू हैं।
Response: 20 आड़ू हैं।
Response:  If there are 6 more acres in Jack's field than in the village, and there are 18 more acres in the village than in the town, then there are 24 more acres in Jack's field than in the town. So, Jack has 24 more acres than the town.
Response:  If Jake has 87 aadus and the ratio of aadus in Jack's station to aadus in Jill's station is 5:1, then Jake has 435 aadus more than Jill.
Response:  If Jill has 12 apples and Jake has 16 apples, then Jake has how many more apples than Jill?
Response:  Jack has 35 aadus (12 + 79) and 14 seeds in total.
Response:  Jack has 13 apples and 3 more than that is 46 apples. So, Jack has 46 apples in total.
Response: स्टीवन के पास सेब से 8 अधिक आड़ू हैं।
Response: स्टीवन के पास 18 सेब हैं।
Response:  Jack has 8 aadus in total. Out of these, 4 aadus are less than the distance between Jack's station and the town, which is 67 adus more than the distance between Jack's station and the village. So, Jack has 8 - 4 = 4 aadus left after reaching the town.
Response:  The number of adjoining pieces is 8.
Response:  Jack has 12 less aadus than Steve and there are 72 more aadus in the village compared to Steve's. So, Jack has 80 aadus (12 - 19 = 80).
Response:  The number of apples in Jack's basket is 6 less than the number of apples in Steve's basket. Therefore, there are 10 apples in Jack's basket (6 + 4 = 10).
Response:  Jack has 10 aadus and 84 seb. So, he has a total of 94 units (10 x 8 = 80 + 84).
Response:  Jack has 17 apples and 12 seeds. So, he has a total of 29 items (apples + seeds).

Response:  The total amount of money that Oliva had was $78. She spent $15 on a supermarket. How much money does she have left? Answer: Oliva has $63 left.
Response:  If Oliva spent $78 on a supermarket and has $33 left over, then the amount of money she had at the beginning was $101 ($78 + $33 = $101).
Response:  The person invested $100 in Oliva's bonds and earned a total of $148 from them. After that, he invested the same amount (i.e., $148) in an ATM and earned $159. So, he made a profit of $11 (=$159 - $148).
Response:  The supermarket owner made $49 more than Oliva in the same amount of time. So, if Oliva made $30 in one hour, the supermarket owner made $79 in the same hour.
Response:  The man invested $53 in Olivaia stocks and later sold them for $91 per dollar. After that, he invested $100 in a supermarket and made a profit of $14. To calculate the amount of money he made from investing in the supermarket, we need to subtract the initial value of the investment ($100) from the total profit ($24). Therefore, the answer is $14.
Response:  If Oliva spent $106 in the supermarket and $26 in the shoe store before the sale, then she spent a total of $132 ($106 + $26) on those two stores. If she had a 25% discount on both stores, then she would have paid $93.60 for the supermarket and $22.80 for the shoe store (calculation: $132 x 75%). So, the amount she saved after the sale is $40.40 ($93.60 - $53.20).
Response:  If Oliva spent $29 after arriving in the supermarket and had $54 at the beginning, then he spent a total of $29 + $54 = $83.
Response:  If Oliva spent $38 on a supermarket and had $128 in her wallet at the beginning, then she has $90 left after the purchase ($128 - $38 = $90).

Answer: Gwen received $8 as a gift on her birthday and spent $2 of it, leaving her with $6. So, she gained $4 on her birthday."
Response:  If the boy spent $3 on something, he would have $17 left after his mother gave him $2 and his father gave him $4. So, the answer is $17.
Response:  If Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father, then she has a total of $13. If she spent $4 on something, then she has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). So, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her father did.
Response:  If Gwen spent $3 on her mother's birthday and her father gave her $6, then she has $9 in total ($3 + $6). If she also spent $4 on something else, then she has $5 left after the purchase ($9 - $4 = $5). So, she has $5 more than what her father gave her.

Response:  The weight of Mark's strobbery was 8 pounds, and the weight of his father's strobbery was 32 pounds. So, the total weight of both their strobberies was 40 pounds (8 + 32 = 40).
Response: 36 पाउंड
Response: 10 पाउंड
"Response: 30 + 12 = 42 पाउंड  

Explanation:
Marko and his father Stroberi decided to share a pound of candy equally between them. They had 22 pounds in total. Marko's father ate 30 more pounds than he did, so Marko's father ate 52 pounds (30 + 22). Therefore, the weight of Marko's stomach after eating all that candy was 36 pounds."
Response: 20 पाउंड
Response:  The weight of Mark's strobbery is 30 pounds, and the weight of his father's strobbery is 17 pounds. So, Mark's strobbery weighs 13 pounds more than his father's strobbery (30 - 17 = 13).
Response:  If Marko's strobbery weight was 10 pounds and his father's strobbery weight was x pounds, then the difference between their strobbery weights is 10 - x pounds. So, if Marko's father's strobbery weight was 26 pounds more than Marko's, then Marko's father's strobbery weight would be 36 pounds (26 + 10).
Response: मार्को के स्ट्रॉबेरी का वजन = (11 x 30) / 2 = 45 पाउंड

Response:  If Becker had sold 51 of the 133 keys he had made, then Becker would have earned 51 x 10 = 510 rupees. So, Becker would have earned an additional amount of 510 rupees by selling those 51 keys.
Response:  If Becker has 54 coins and he sells some of them, then the number of coins he has left after selling is equal to the number of coins he sold minus the number of coins he had before selling. So if he sold 13 coins, then he has 54 - 13 = 41 coins left.
Response:  The beker made 145 keys and sold them all. So, the number of keys he has left is zero.
Response:  If Becker has 155 keys and his friend buys 140 keys from him, then Becker will have 15 - (140 / 2) = 35 keys left.
Response: बेकर ने 121 केक बनाए थे, उन्होंने 105 बेचे और 170 नए केक खरीदे गए, तो अभी भी बेकर के पास 126 केक (105 + 17) हैं।
Response:  The beker bought 13 coins and sold 91 of them. He also bought 154 new coins. So the number of coins that the beker bought is 91 + 154 = 245 coins.
Response:  The beker bought 170 keys and sold 78 of them. So, the number of keys he sold is 78.
Response: बेकर ने 110 केक बनाए थे, उन्होंने 75 बेचे थे, फिर उसने 76 और केक बनाए थे, तो अभी भी बेकर के पास 110 - 75 = 35 केक हैं।
Response: 253
Response:  If Becker has made 149 keys and 91 pastries, and he wants to sell 10 keys and 90 pastries, then Becker will have 59 keys left (149 - 10 = 59) and 81 pastries left (91 - 90 = 81).
Response:  If Becker has already sold 7 kegs and 148 pouches, then he still has 15 kegs and 103 pouches left.
Response:  If Beker had sold 115 kegs and 81 pests, then he would have made an additional profit of 34 kegs (115 - 81 = 34).
Response:  If Becker had sold 70 kilograms of cannabis and 88 pastries instead of 19 kilograms and 131 pastries as he originally planned, then Becker would have made 51 pastries (70 - 19 = 51) and 69 pastries (88 - 13 = 69).
Response:  If Beker had sold 158 keys and 147 pastries instead of 157 keys and 169 pastries as given in the question, then he would have sold a total of 305 keys (158 + 147).
Response:  If Becker had sold 68 kilograms and 92 pastries instead of 54 kilograms and 143 pastries, then he would have sold an additional 14 kilograms (68 - 54 = 14) and 30 pastries (92 - 143 = -59) more than what he actually sold. So, the total number of pastries that Becker sold is 14 + (-59) = 73 pastries less than what he actually sold.
Response:  If Beker had sold 44 keys before he made 48 keys, then there are currently 44 - 48 = -4 keys in his possession.
Response:  If Becker had started with 40 keys and sold 8 in the beginning, then he would have had 32 keys left. If he sold those 32 keys at a profit of 50%, then he would have made a profit of 16 keys (32 x 50% = 16). So, Becker sold a total of 96 keys (8 + 16 = 96).
Response:  If the friend of Becker had bought 137 kg of wheat from him earlier and now Becker has 169 kg of wheat in his possession, then Becker has gained 32 kg (169 - 137 = 32) of wheat.
Response: बेकर ने 173 केक बनाए थे, उन्होंने 103 नए केक खरीदे और 86 केक बेचे गए, तो अभी भी बेकर के पास 25 केक हैं (173 - 103 = 70) जिसे बेकर ने बेचे हैं (86).
Response:  The bekar bought 99 coins and sold 89 of them. So he gained 10 coins (99 - 89 = 10).
Response: बेकर ने 139 नए केक खरीदे और 145 केक बेचे, अतः वह 139 + 145 = 284 केक बेचे थे.

Response:  If Becker had sold 108 quintals of wheat and 44 pieces of peas, then he would have 259 quintals of wheat left with him.
Response:  If Becker had sold 104 quintals of wheat and 29 packets of pulses instead of the given 56 packets, then he would have 37 packets of pulses left with him.
Response:  If Becker had sold 102 quintals of wheat and 94 peas, then he would have made additional revenue of 16 quintals (102 - 84 = 18) from wheat and 37 quintals (94 - 52 = 42) from peas. Therefore, the total additional revenue earned by Becker is 16 + 42 = 58 quintals.
"Response:  If Becker has made 134 pastries and 11 cakes, and he wants to sell them for Rs. 140 each, then he will make a profit of:

Profit = Number of pastries sold x Price per pastry - Cost price of pastries
= 134 x 140 - Cost price of pastries

Let's assume the cost price of one pastry is Rs. 50. Then,

Profit = 134 x 140 - (50 x 134)
= 18,600 - 67,000
= -48,400

So, Becker will lose Rs. 48,400 if he sells all 134 pastries and 11 cakes at Rs. 140 each."
Response:  If Beker had sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes instead of the original 14 pastries and 153 cakes, then he would have sold a total of 8 + 97 = 105 units.
Response:  If Becker had sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes instead of the 43 pastries and 114 cakes he actually sold, then Becker would have sold an additional 206 pastries (154 - 43) and 46 cakes (78 - 114).
Response:  The number of games that Kelvin can buy with the money he has is 140 / 2 = 70 games.
Response:  If there are 106 games and she removes 64 of them, then the number of remaining games is 42.
Response:  If Kalli has given away 91 games so far and there are still 92 games left in the tournament, then he must have had at least 92 games at the start of the tournament.
"Response:  The number of games that Kel must play to have a probability of 12 of winning at least one game is given by the formula:

Number of games = (Probability of winning at least one game) / (1 - Probability of losing all games)

In this case, the probability of winning at least one game is 70/140 = 0.50 or 50%. So, we can calculate the number of games as follows:

Number of games = 0.50 / (1 - 0.30) = 8

Therefore, Kel needs to play 8 games to have a probability of 12 of winning at least one game."
"Response:  The number of soni games that can be given to keli so that she has 31 soni games left after giving her the games is 75.

Explanation:

Keli has 46 nintendos and 132 sonis. If we give her all the nintendo games, she will have 46 - 132 = -86 nintendo games left. Since soni games are worth 2 nintendos each, Keli needs 31 x 2 = 62 soni games to make up for the lost nintendo games. Therefore, the maximum number of soni games that can be given to Keli is 75 (62 + 13)."
Response:  The number of games that must be left behind for the person to have 6 games in total is 29.
Response:  If Randi has 52 blocks and he uses them to build a tower, then the number of blocks left after 38 blocks are built is 14 (52 - 38 = 14).
"Response:  The person has 97 blocks and wants to build a tower with some of them. If he can use 72 blocks, then how many blocks did he use to build the tower?

Answer:
The person used 72 blocks to build the tower."
Response:  Total number of blocks = 79 - (14 + 11) = 54 blocks are left after Randi uses 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. Therefore, 54 blocks are left.
Response:  The man used a total of 85 blocks to build the tower and the house. He used 27 blocks to build the tower and 53 blocks to build the house.
Response:  The number of blocks used by Randi to build his house is 13.
Response:  The man has 86 blocks and he uses 79 of them to build a tower. He uses the remaining 8 blocks to build a house. So, he used 13 blocks (8 - 79) for building the house.
Response:  If Randi has 36 blocks and wants to make a tower, he can use 36 of them. If he had 59 blocks instead, then he could have made a taller tower with more blocks.
Response:  The person has used a total of 145 blocks (20 + 50) to build their house and tower.
Response:  The person has used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So, the total number of blocks used by the person is 89 + 63 = 152 blocks.
Response:  I have read 3 books out of the 20 different books in my school library so far.
Response:  The number of books in the library is 21 (13 books that you have read + 8 books that you haven't read yet).
Response:  If a person has read 12 books and watched 56 movies, then they have seen a total of 68 different works of art (books + movies). To determine how many more books the person needs to read in order to reach 22 different books, we need to subtract the number of books they have already read from the desired total of 22. Therefore, the answer is 22 - 12 = 10 more books.
Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you have seen a total of 26 different works of art (books + movies).
"Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then there are how many more movies in the ""Pagal Muraakshi School"" series compared to the number of books you have read?

Hint: You can use the information provided in the question to help you solve this problem."
Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies, then in the 'Pagal MooRakshak School' chart, there are more movies than books. The difference between the number of movies and books is 42 (61 - 19).
Response:  If you have read 10 different books and watched 11 different movies, then you have seen more movies than books. In this case, the number of movies you have seen is 11, while the number of books you have read is 10. So, the difference between the number of movies and books you have seen is 1.
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then you have seen more movies than books. In this case, the answer is 21 - 7 = 14 movies.
Response:  The number of books in the library is not specified in the passage. Therefore, we cannot determine how many more or fewer books are available for you to read.
"Response:  If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies, then you still have to read a lot of books. To calculate the exact number, we need to know how many pages are in each book and movie. Let's assume that an average book has 200-300 pages and an average movie is 2 hours long (which means it has around 120 minutes).

So, if you have read 4 books with an average page count of 250 pages per book, then you have spent around 1000 minutes reading (4 x 250 = 1000). And if you have watched 34 movies with an average running time of 120 minutes per movie, then you have spent around 4080 minutes watching movies (34 x 120 = 4080).

Now, let's subtract the time spent on watching movies from the total time spent on both activities: 1000 - 4080 = -3080 minutes. This means that you still have to spend around 3080 minutes reading books."
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, then you have seen a total of 11 cultural artifacts (7 books + 4 movies).
"Response:  If you read 11 books and watch 40 movies, then the number of more movies in the ""Pagal Muraaksh School"" category is 29 (40 - 11)."
"Response:  If you read 13 books and watch 63 movies, there are more movies than books in the ""Pagal Muraaksh School"" series. The number of movies is 63, while the number of books is 13. So, there are 50 more movies than books in the series."
Response:  If you have watched 14 movies and read 19 books, then you have read more books than movies. The number of books you have read is 19, while the number of movies you have watched is 14. So, your total score is 19 - 14 = 5.
Response:  If a person has watched 8 different movies and read 16 books, then they have watched more movies than the number of books they have read. In this case, the difference between the number of movies and books is 8 - 16 = -8. Therefore, the person has watched -8 movies more than the number of books they have read.
Response:  If Dev had won 7 tickets in the arcaded game and he was using some of them to bet on other games, then the number of tickets he used for betting would be less than 7. For example, if he used 3 tickets for betting and he had 4 remaining tickets, then he used 3/7 = 0.429 (or approximately 42.9%) of his total tickets for betting.
Response:  If Dev won 8 tickets in the arcaded lottery and he bought 12 tickets for the next draw, then he has won a total of 8 + 12 = 20 tickets so far.
Response:  If Dev had won 18 tickets in the arcades, and he bought some of them with 5 others, then he would have got 13 tickets (18 - 5 = 13). And if he bought 11 more tickets with 4 others, then he would have got 7 tickets (11 + 4 = 7). So, in total, Dev would have got 20 tickets (13 + 7 = 20).
Response:  If Dev had bought 12 tickets for himself and used them to bet on the matches, he would have won a total of 360 rupees (12 x 30 = 360). Since he also bought 7 more tickets and used them to bet on the matches, he would have won an additional amount of 210 rupees (7 x 30 = 210), making his total winnings 570 rupees (360 + 210).
Response:  If Dev had won 13 tickets in the arcaded game and he bought 8 tickets for Rs. 80 each, 18 caps for Rs. 20 each, and used 7 tickets to buy a cap worth Rs. 40, then he spent a total of Rs. 80 + Rs. 160 = Rs. 240 on buying tickets and caps.
Response:  If Dev had won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets in the arcades, then he would have left with 12 tickets (14 - 2 = 12).
Response: 108 पेड़ ।
Response: 12 पेड़ मरने वालें थे।
Response: 16 पेड़)
Response:  If Helly had planted 12 trees and one of them died after 5 years, then the number of trees that will grow is 11.
Response: 9 - 4 = 5 पेड़ बचे हैं!
Response:  If there were 12 trees in the field and 2 of them died after a storm, then there are 10 trees left in the field.
Response:  If Helly had started planting trees in the first place with 3 instead of 13, then more trees would have survived the storm. Let's assume that each tree has a 50% chance of surviving the storm. Then, the probability of exactly 3 trees surviving is (1/2)^3 = 1/8, and the probability of exactly 4 or fewer trees surviving is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. Therefore, the number of trees that did not survive the storm is 13 - 3 = 10.
"Response:  If there were initially 11 trees and 2 of them died after a storm, then the number of trees that survived the storm is:

11 - 2 = 9

So, out of the initial 11 trees, 9 survived the storm."
"Response:  If Santosh cuts 66 bores in a day and each bore has 28 santars, then he cuts how many santars per day?

Hint: Convert the given information from decimal to fraction form."
Response:  The number of days in 24 boros (weeks) is 7. So, if Santra cuts 8 branches per day, he will have cut 56 branches in total in 24 weeks.
Response:  The farmer can cut 12 bores of wheat in a day. If he works for 4 days, he will be able to cut a total of 48 bores of wheat.
"Response:  The number of bags of wheat that will be available after 49 days are as follows:

Total number of bags = Total number of bags per day x Number of days
= 38 bags/day x 49 days
= 1762 bags

Therefore, after 49 days, there will be 1762 bags of wheat available."
"Response:  The number of Santas produced in 87 days will be:

Total number of Santas = Total number of Boris x Number of Santas per Bori
= 66 x 25
= 1600

Therefore, after 87 days, there will be 1600 Santas."
Response:  The number of Santas cut by the man per day is 240. Explanation: Each Borio has 35 Santas, and there are 8 Boriyas in a day, so the total number of Santas cut by the man per day is 240 (8 x 35).
"Response:  The number of days it will take to cut 80 Santare (a unit of measurement equal to 57 Boriyas) in a day is:

A. 4 days
B. 8 days
C. 12 days
D. 16 days
E. 32 days"
"Response:  If Santosh cuts 35 branches in total, then he will have cut 12 santrees per branch on average. Therefore, the number of santreees he has cut is:

35 branches x 12 santreees/branch = 420 santreees

So, Santosh has cut 420 santreees in total."

"Response:  If Santosh cuts 82 bores of wheat and 61 bores of barley in a day, then after 25 days he will have how many more bores of wheat?

Solution:
Let the number of bores of wheat be x. Then, we know that Santosh has cut 82/x bores of wheat in 25 days. Similarly, he has cut 61/x bores of barley in 25 days.

Now, let's find out the value of x. We can do this by using the proportion formula:

x = (82/x) × (25/82) = (61/x) × (25/61)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

x = 30

So, after 25 days, Santosh will have 30 + 82 = 112 bores of wheat."
Response:  The number of incomplete Santare will be 24 x 45 = 1040.
Response:  The number of pots that are partially filled with water is 17.
Response:  The number of more than 50% defective bricks produced by the machine per day is 39.
Response:  If Santra had cut 54 branches of the tree in total and he cuts 18 branches per day, then he would have taken __________ days to cut all the branches.
"Response:  The number of days it took for the Santra to cut 56 branches of Narangi trees can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that the Santra started cutting branches on day 1 and continued for 14 days.

On day 1, he cut 56 branches, so the number of branches he cut per day is:

56 branches / 1 day = 56 branches/day

On day 2, he cut 56 x 2 = 112 branches. On day 3, he cut 112 x 2 = 224 branches, and so on.

So, the total number of branches cut by the Santra in 14 days is:

Total branches cut = (56 x 14) + (112 x 13) + (224 x 12) +... + (56 x 1) = 70984 branches

Therefore, the Santra cut a total of 70984 branches of Narangi trees in 14 days."
Response:  If Santosh cuts 25 branches of the tree every day and there are 73 days left in the growing season, then he will have cut a total of 1825 branches (25 x 73 = 1825).
"Response:  If Santosh cuts 65 borer santare and 46 borer pake santare in 6 days, then after how many days he will have 100 bore anripe santare?

"Response:  The number of paripakva santare kataop can be calculated as follows:

Total number of paripakva santare = 41 + 86 = 127

Number of borere paripakva santare = Total number of paripakva santare / 4 = 127 / 4 = 31

Therefore, on an average, 31 borere paripakva santare are cut every day."
"Response:  The number of more than average able-bodied Santals who cut down 71 trees and 60 trees per day respectively can be calculated as follows:

Let X be the number of more than average able-bodied Santals.

From the given information, we know that the total number of able-bodied Santals is 240 (71 + 60 = 131).

So, the proportion of more than average able-bodied Santals in the total population of able-bodied Santals is:

X/240 = (71+60)/240 = 131/240 = 0.55

Therefore, there are approximately 0.55 times more than average able-bodied Santals among those who cut down 71 trees and 60 trees per day respectively."
Response:  The length of the room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 132 square feet (12 x 11 = 132).
"Response:  The height of the room is given as 7 feet. If you want to make it 14 varge feet tall, then the length of the room will be:

Length = Height x Number of Feet
= 7 x 14
= 98 feet

Therefore, the length of the room is 98 feet."
"Response:  The length of the room is 7 feet. If you want to make it 14 varge feet long, its length will be:

L = 14 x 3 = 42 feet

So, the length of the room is 42 feet."
Response:  The height of the room is 11 feet and the width is 15 feet. If there were walls on all sides before construction began, then the total area of the walls that need to be painted is 160 square feet (11 x 15 = 165 square feet). Therefore, the amount of paint needed is 160 square feet / 96 square feet per gallon = approximately 1.7 gallons.
Response:  Total number of tiles required = (Length x Width) / (Tile size x Number of tiles per foot) = (20 x 12) / (4 x 3) = 80 tiles.
"Response:  The height of the room is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet. If there are 20 rooms in total, then the number of square feet required to cover all the floors will be:

Total area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 sq ft

So, the number of square feet required to cover all the floors is 342 sq ft."
Response:  The height of the room is 19 feet and its length is 20 feet. So, the width of the room is (length x height) / 2 = (20 x 19) / 2 = 38 feet.
Response:  The height of the ceiling in Jessie's room is 8 feet. If her room is 5 feet long, then the length of the ceiling is equal to the length of the room multiplied by the height of the ceiling, which is: 5 x 8 = 40 feet.
Response:  The length of the room is 10 feet, and it has a height of 2 feet. Therefore, the area of the room is 10 x 2 = 20 square feet.
Response:  The height of the room is 4 feet and the length is 20 feet. To find out how much space is available for furniture, we need to subtract the height from the length. So, the total available space for furniture is 20 - 4 = 16 feet.
Response:  The number of t-shirts sold by the store is given by the equation: T = 23 x (B/P), where T is the number of t-shirts sold, B is the price of one t-shirt, and P is the percentage profit made on each t-shirt. Since the store makes a profit of 23% on each t-shirt, we can write the equation as: T = 23 x (B/1 + 0.23). To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we need to solve for T in terms of B. We know that the total revenue generated from selling t-shirts is $230, so we can write the equation: T x B = 230. Solving for T, we get: T = $230 / ($1 + 0.23) = 650. Therefore, the store sold 650 t-shirts during the period.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $20. So, the revenue earned by the store during the sale of 3 T-shirts is $60 ($20 x 3).
Response:  If the Reject Shop sells each t-shirt for $87 and they sell a total of 95 t-shirts during both Arkansas and Texas games, then they made a total of $8235 from selling t-shirts ($87 x 95 = $8235).
Response:  If the Reject Shop sells each t-shirt for $106 and they sell a total of 242 t-shirts during both Arkansas and Texas games, then they sold 115 t-shirts during Arkansas games and 127 t-shirts during Texas games.
Response:  If the Reject Shop sells each T-shirt for $20 and they sell a total of 163 T-shirts during both Arkansas and Texas games, then they made a total of $3,260 in revenue from selling T-shirts ($20 x 163 T-shirts). However, if they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and 74 T-shirts during the Texas game, then their total revenue from selling T-shirts would be $2,520 ($20 x 89 T-shirts + $20 x 74 T-shirts).
"Response:  If each t-shirt costs $ 78 and the total number of t-shirts sold is 186, then the revenue generated from selling t-shirts is:

Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt
= 186 x $ 78
= $ 143,056

If Arkansas played in 172 games and Texas played in 19 games, then the total number of games played by both teams is:

Total number of games = Number of games played by Arkansas + Number of games played by Texas
= 172 + 19
= 191 games

Therefore, if they had sold 186 t-shirts during these games, they would have made $ 143,056 in revenue."
Response:  The total revenue from selling t-shirts is 183 x $62 = $11,456. The total revenue from selling jeans is 31 x $99 = $3,079. Therefore, the total revenue from both t-shirts and jeans is $11,456 + $3,079 = $14,535.
Response:  The total revenue from selling t-shirts and jeans is given by the equation: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt + Number of Jeans x Price per Jeans. In this case, the number of t-shirts sold is 74, and the price per t-shirt is $67. Therefore, the total revenue from selling t-shirts is: Total Revenue = 74 x $67 = $4892. Similarly, the number of jeans sold is 156, and the price per jean is $165. Therefore, the total revenue from selling jeans is: Total Revenue = 156 x $165 = $25,340. So, in total, they made $29,782 in revenue from selling both t-shirts and jeans.
Response:  The price of each T-shirt is $ 192 and the price of each jeans is $ 34. Therefore, the total revenue from selling one T-shirt is $ 192 - $ 34 = $ 158. So, the number of T-shirts that can be sold to make the same amount of money as selling one pair of jeans is $\frac {158}{34} = 4.62$ pairs of T-shirts.
Response:  $ 86 / $ 232 = 0.37 जर्सी की लागत एक टी-शर्ट के लिए है।
Response:  The total revenue earned by the store is given by the equation: Revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt. In this case, the number of T-shirts sold is 130 and the price per T-shirt is $51. Therefore, the total revenue earned by the store is: Revenue = 130 x $51 = $6,430.
Response:  The total revenue generated by the store is 201 dollars per t-shirt. Arkansas and Texas are playing a game during which they sold 14 t-shirts at a price of $217 each. Therefore, the total amount of money made by selling these t-shirts is 201 x 14 = $2850.
"Response:  If Arknas and Texs sell each t-shirt for $10, then they will have to sell a total of 60 t-shirts to make $600 in revenue. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold by each person is:

Arknas: 60 / 2 = 30 t-shirts
Texs: 60 - 30 = 30 t-shirts"
"Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $8. Therefore, the total revenue earned by the store during the sale period is:
Revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Cost price per T-shirt
= 5 T-shirts x $8
= $40
So, the profit made by the store is:
Profit = Revenue - Costs
= $40 -? (cost of advertising and other expenses)

Note: This answer assumes that there are no other costs or expenses involved in selling the T-shirts, such as packaging, shipping, etc."
Response:  The total amount of money that Raj and Ria made from selling t-shirts and jeans is given by the equation: Total Amount = Number of T-Shirts x Price per T-Shirt + Number of Jeans x Price per Jeans. In this case, Raj and Ria sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jeans. So, we can plug these values into the equation to find out how much money they made: Total Amount = 20 x $5 + 64 x $215 = $1,370 + $13,840 = $15,210. Therefore, Raj and Ria made a total of $15,210 in profit from selling t-shirts and jeans during their trip to Arkansas and Texas.
Response:  The total revenue from selling t-shirts is 204 x 158 = $31,920. The total revenue from selling jeans is 76 x 2 = $152. Therefore, the total revenue from both sales is $31,920 + $152 = $32,072.
Response:  The price of a t-shirt is $240 and that of a jeans is $210. Therefore, the price of one t-shirt is $240 - $210 = $30 more than the price of one jeans.

Response:  The total amount of money earned by Louis in 5 weeks is $460. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide the total amount by the number of weeks: $460 / 5 = $92 per week.
"Response:  The number of weeks the money will last can be calculated as follows:

Total amount of money = $1216
Weekly income = $16 per week

To find out how many weeks the money will last, we need to divide the total amount of money by the weekly income:

Number of weeks = Total amount of money / Weekly income
= $1216 / $16
= 78 weeks

Therefore, if Louis makes $16 every week, he will have enough money to last for 78 weeks or approximately 2 years and 4 months."
"Response:  The farmer earns $21 per day, and he makes a total of 702 dollars in 216 days. Therefore, at the end of the growing season, the farmer will have earned a total of:

$21 x 216 = $4,386

So, the farmer's total earnings at the end of the growing season are $4,386."
Response:  The farmer can make $96,810 ($1357 x 73) in a year by growing 73 crops during the 223 weeks of the growing season.
"Response:  $ 24568 

Explanation:

Luis makes $28 per hour working 1091 hours in a year. He also works as an overtime worker for $939 per week. If he works every week, his total earnings in a year would be:

Total earnings = Number of weeks worked x Hourly wage + Overtime pay
= 52 weeks x $28/hour + ($939/week x 52 weeks)
= $24568

Therefore, Luis's total earnings in a year are $24568."
Response:  The farmer can make $17,568 per year ($403 x 233 weeks).
Response:  The farmer earns $368 per week, which is equivalent to $1,472 per month. If he had invested the same amount of money in a savings account that pays an interest rate of 3%, then after one year, he would have earned $4,312 in interest, bringing his total balance to $5,784.
"Response:  If Louis makes $491 per week and invests $216 of that amount each day, he will have $X at the end of 1181 weeks (or approximately 27 years). To find out how much money Louis will have at the end of this period, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P x (1 + r)^n

Where:
A = final amount
P = principal amount ($491 in this case)
r = daily rate of return (216/491 = 0.435 or 43.5%)
n = number of days (365 days per year x 1181 weeks = 417,615 days)

Plugging in these values, we get:

A = $491 x (1 + 0.435)^(417,615) ≈ $1,077,677

So, if Louis invests $216 of his weekly income each day for 27 years, he will have approximately $1,077,677 at the end of that period."
Response:  $ 133 / 7 = $ 18.57
Response:  The total amount of money earned by Louis in 178 days is $178 x 30 = $5340. So the number of weeks it took for him to earn this amount is $5340 / $2 = 267 weeks.
Response:  If the depth of water in the well is 9 feet and the diameter of the well is 3 feet, then the volume of water in the well can be calculated as follows: Volume of water = π x (diameter/2)^2 x height Where diameter = 3 feet Height = 9 feet So, the volume of water in the well is approximately 7.65 cubic feet. Now, if we assume that the density of water is 1 gram per milliliter, then the weight of water in the well can be calculated as follows: Weight of water = Volume of water x Density of water Where density of water = 1 gm/ml So, the weight of water in the well is approximately 7.65 kilograms or 16.8 pounds. Therefore, the depth of water in the well from the surface to the bottom is approximately 9 feet or 2.7 meters.
Response:  The depth of the water in the well is 20 feet. If Ron is 8 feet tall and stands on the edge of the well, how deep will the water be from his feet? Answer: The water will be 12 feet deep from Ron's feet.
"Response:  If the depth of water is 5 times the height of Denali (8640 m), then the depth of water would be:

(5 x 8640) = 43200 meters

So, the water is approximately 43200 meters deep."
"Response:  The depth of the water is given as 15 feet in the problem statement. If the density of water is 1 g/cm^3 and the height of the well is 40 feet, then the volume of water in the well can be calculated as follows:

Volume of water = Volume of a cylinder = π x radius^2 x height
= π x (15 ft)^2 x 40 ft
= 675 cubic feet

Now, if Ron is standing on the bottom of the well, which is 13 feet deep, then the distance between him and the top of the well is:

Distance = Height - Depth
= 40 ft - 13 ft
= 27 ft

So, the depth of the water from Ron's position is:

Depth = Distance / 2
= 27 ft / 2
= 13.5 ft

Therefore, the water is approximately 13.5 feet deep where Ron is standing."
Response:  If the depth of water is 16 feet and the height of Ron is 9 feet, then the volume of water is 16 x 9 = 144 cubic feet. Since Ron is standing on a rectangular prism with dimensions 13 x 5 x 3 feet, the volume of the prism is 13 x 5 x 3 = 270 cubic feet. Therefore, the difference in volume between the two is 270 - 144 = 126 cubic feet.
Response:  The depth of the water in the pool is 9 feet. If Ron is 15 feet long and Den is 6 feet shorter than Ron, then the distance between Ron and the water is 7 feet (15 - 6 = 9). So, the water is 9 + 7 = 16 feet deep from Ron.

Therefore, Brain has a total of 3811 pages in his books and publications."
"Response:  If Brain has 9 books and 46 newspapers, then in each of his 10 books there are on average how many newspapers?

Solution:
Let's assume the number of newspapers in each book is x. Then, the total number of newspapers Brain has is 46. Since he has 10 books, the total number of newspapers in all his books is 10x.

Now, let's find out the average number of newspapers in each book:
Average = Total number of newspapers / Number of books
= 10x / 10
= x

So, in each of Brain's 10 books, there are on average x newspapers."
Response:  If Brain has 23 books and 61 newspapers, then the total number of books he has is 23 + 61 = 84. Therefore, the average number of books in each of his 29 piles is 84 / 29 = 2.86 books per pile. Similarly, the total number of newspapers he has is 61, and the average number of newspapers in each pile is 61 / 29 = 2.07 newspapers per pile.
"Response:  If Brain has 7 books in each of his 3 shelves, and he has a total of 28 books, then the number of books in each shelf is:

Response:  The number of seats in the Ferris wheel is 18 x 9 = 162 seats.
Response:  The number of people who can sit in each ferry at a time is 15. Therefore, the total number of people who can go to different islands at one time is 15 x 20 = 300.
Response:  The number of people who can be accommodated in the ferry at one time is given by the equation: Number of people = Total seats available / Number of seats per trip. Since there are 18 seats in the ferry and 10 seats have been occupied, we need to find out how many trips it will take to accommodate all the passengers. Let's assume that each trip can accommodate 15 people. So, the total number of trips required to accommodate all the passengers is: Total trips = Number of passengers / Number of people per trip = 10 / 15 = 2/3 trips. Therefore, approximately 2/3 trips are required to accommodate all the passengers.
Response:  The number of people who can be accommodated in the Swarg Park at a time is 60. If there are already 16 people present in the park, then how many more people can join them? Answer: 60 - 16 = 44 people can join them.

Response:  If we have 9 orders and each order has 10 pieces, then the total number of pieces in all the orders is 9 x 10 = 90 pieces. So, if we have 2 orders, then each order will contain 45 pieces (90 / 2).
"Response:  If Paige and her mother had planted 10 seeds in each of the 45 flowers, then they would have planted a total of:

45 flowers x 10 seeds/flower = 450 seeds

So, they would have planted 450 seeds in total."
"Response:  If each flower has 45 seeds and they are planted in equal numbers in each pot, then the number of seeds that will be planted in each pot is:

Number of flowers = 9
Number of seeds per flower = 45
Total number of seeds = Number of flowers x Number of seeds per flower
= 9 x 45
= 405 seeds

Therefore, there will be 405 seeds in each pot if each flower is planted with an equal number of seeds."
Response:  The number of flowers that Paige's mother planted was 36. Since each flower pot had 12 seeds and only 58 flowers grew in all the pots, the total number of flowers that Paige's mother planted was 36 x 12 = 432 flowers.
Response:  The number of flowers that grew is 39.
"Response:  If they had planted 60 seeds in total and each seed produced 10 flowers, then the number of flowers they would have had is:

60 x 10 = 600 flowers

So, there were 600 flowers in their garden."
Response:  If the mother had planted 8 flowers in each of the 4 beds, then she would have planted a total of 32 seeds (8 x 4 = 32).
Response:  If Mathieu gave each of his 11 friends 2 patties, then Mathieu had a total of 2 x 11 = 22 patties.
Response:  If Mathieu gave each of his 8 friends 2 patakhe each, then he gave a total of 16 patakhe to his friends.
Response:  Each of Mathieu's 5 friends received an equal number of patthes (balls). So, each friend received 1/5 = 0.2 patthes. Since there were initially 15 patthes and 5 friends, the total number of patthes after distribution is: 15 x 0.2 = 3 patthes.
Response:  If Mathieu had given his three friends an equal number of patatoes, then he would have given them 8 patatoes each (since there were originally 24 patatoes and 3 friends). So, the total number of patatoes that Mathieu gave to his friends is 8 x 3 = 24 patatoes.
"Response:  If Mathieu had given his 11 friends a total of 22 patties and 34 keks, then each friend would have received:

Patties: 22 / 11 = 2 patties per person
Keks: 34 / 11 = 3 keks per person"
"Response:  If Mathieu had 29 pats and 30 keys, and he gave each of his two friends an equal number in terms of pats and keys, then each friend would have received:

Pats: 29/2 = 14.5 pats (rounded to nearest whole number)
Keys: 30/2 = 15 keys (since there are 2 friends, each will get 15 keys)"
"Response:  If Mathieu had 14 patties and 21 keks, and he divided them equally among his 7 friends, then each friend would have received:

Patties: 14 / 7 = 2 patties per person
Keks: 21 / 7 = 3 keks per person"
Response:  If Maithili had 18 friends and gave each of them an equal number of sweets, then each person would have received $\frac{18 \times 36}{18} = 20$ sweets.
Response:  If Maithili gave each of her friends 6 patashees, and she had a total of 36 patashees to give away, then she gave 6/36 = 1/6 of the total number of patashees to each of her friends. Therefore, she gave 1/6 x 6 = 10 patashees to her friends in total.
Response:  Each of the three friends received an equal number of sweets, so each friend received 23/3 = 7 sweets.
Response:  Maitreya gave his five friends 7 patas each, so he gave a total of 35 patas (7 x 5 = 35).
Response:  If each of the four friends received an equal number of patties and keks, then they would have received a total of 32 patties and 98 keks among them. Since there are 4 friends, each friend will receive 8 patties (32/4) and 24 keks (98/4).
Response:  If Maithili has 4 friends and each friend gets an equal number of patthas and kekes, then the total number of patthas and kekes that Maithili gave to her friends is 10 + 8 = 18. So, each friend got 18 / 4 = 4.5 patthas and kekes each.
Response:  If Maithili has 28 friends and distributes sweets equally among them, then each friend will get $\frac{28}{28} = 1$ sweet. Therefore, the total number of sweets distributed is $1 \times 28 = 28$.
Response:  If Debby bought 109 bottles of water in one day and she drank them all, then she must have bought at least 74 bottles in total during the 74 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 153 bottles of water and drank one bottle every day for 17 days, then she would have drunk a total of 153 x 17 = 2491 bottles of water.
Response:  The number of bottles Debi bought is 264. If she used 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then the total number of bottles she used is 264 x 15 = 3900. So, Debi has thrown away 3900 - 15 = 3885 bottles.
"Response:  If Debby bought 301 bottles of water and then gave away some of them every day for 14 days, how many bottles did she have left on the 14th day?

Solution:
Let's assume that Debby had x bottles of water left on the 14th day. Since she gave away some bottles every day, we can write an equation to represent this:

x - 144 = x - 157

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 281 = 0

Now, let's solve for x:

2x = 281
x = 140

So, Debby had 140 bottles of water left on the 14th day."
"Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda, then in one day she can drink 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda. Therefore, the number of days it will take for her to finish all the bottles is:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day
= 91 / 4
= 22.75 days
So, it will take Debbie approximately 22.75 days to finish all the bottles."
"Response:  If Debi bought 200 pots of water and 256 sooda pots in a single day, then the number of days it would take for her to buy 312 pots of water and 4 sooda pots can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that Debi buys one pot of water or one sooda pot every day. Then, the total number of pots she will buy is:

Water pots = 312 (total number of pots she wants to buy) / 1 (number of pots per day) = 312 days
Sooda pots = 4 (total number of pots she wants to buy) / 1 (number of pots per day) = 4 days

Therefore, it will take Debi 312 days to buy 312 pots of water and 4 days to buy 4 sooda pots."
Response:  The number of days that Debby can drink 6 bottles of water is 3 days.
"Response:  The number of days that the water bottles will last can be calculated as follows:

Total amount of water = 180 liters
Number of water bottles = 95
Capacity of each water bottle = 20 liters

To find out how many days the water will last, we need to divide the total amount of water by the capacity of each water bottle:

Days = Total amount of water / Capacity of each water bottle
= 180 liters / 20 liters per bottle
= 9 days

Therefore, if Debbie buys 15 water bottles and 54 sodas in one day, the water bottles will last for 9 days."
"Response:  The number of days that the sodas will last can be calculated as follows:

Let's assume that Debi bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. If she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 sodas in one day, then the number of sodas she drank in a day is:

9 / 162 = 0.055 (approximately)

So, Debi drank approximately 5.5 sodas per day. Since there are 360 bottles of soda, the number of days that the sodas will last is:

360 / 5.5 = 64.7 (approximately)

Therefore, the sodas will last for approximately 64.7 days."

Total number of students in the school = 67
Number of classes in the school = 67 / 6 (as there are 6 periods in a day) = 11
Number of students per class = 66
Number of buses required = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 67 / 6 = 11
Therefore, 11 buses are required to transport the students from school to their homes."
"Response:  The number of buses required for transporting the students from school to their homes can be calculated as follows:

Total number of students = 87
Number of students per classroom = 58
Number of classes = 10 (assuming each class has 5-6 students)
Total number of trips = Total number of students x Number of classes
Trips per day = Total number of trips / Number of days in a week (let's assume it is 5 days/week)
Buses required = Total number of trips / Number of buses that can carry passengers at once

So, the calculation would be:

Total number of trips = 87 x 10 = 870
Trips per day = 870 / 5 = 174 trips per day
Buses required = 174 / 2 = 87 buses
Therefore, 87 buses are required to transport the students from school to their homes."
Response: 24 × 120 = 2880 छात्र हैं।
"Response:  The number of buses required for the school trip can be calculated as follows:

Total number of students = 102

"Response:  The number of buses required for transporting students from a school with 72 classes and 3 seats per bus can be calculated as follows:

Total number of students in the school = 72 classes x 3 students per class = 216 students

Since there are 111 students in total, we need to find out how many buses are required to accommodate all the students. To do this, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus:

Number of buses required = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 216 students / 3 students per bus = 72 buses

Therefore, 72 buses are required to transport all the students from the school."
Response:  The total number of seats in the school is 92. Since there are 46 buses, each bus can accommodate an average of 2 students per seat. Therefore, the total number of seats in each bus = 46 x 2 = 92.

"Response:  Total number of bottles = 57 + 26 + 27 = 100

Explanation:
The question is asking about the total number of bottles in a store that has 57 full bottles of kerosene, 26 empty bottles of kerosene, and 27 empty bottles of diesel oil. To find the total number of bottles, we need to add the number of full and empty bottles. So, the answer is 100."
Response:  The number of bottles of diet soda that were more than the normal amount is 40.
"Response:  The number of bottles of soda that the store sold is given by the equation:

S = 40x + 6y

where x represents the number of bottles of regular soda (40) and y represents the number of bottles of diet soda (6). To find out how many bottles of each type of soda were sold, we can substitute the values for x and y into the equation and solve for S. For example, if x = 25 and y = 10, then the total number of bottles of soda sold would be:

S = 40(25) + 6(10) = 1000 + 60 = 1060

Therefore, the store sold a total of 1060 bottles of soda."

Number of visitors = Total number of agnatiques / Number of days
= 557 / 57
= 9.8

Therefore, approximately 9.8 people visited Bakigram Palace during the last 57 days."
Response:  If there were 39 penthouses in Bakigram Palace and each penthouse had 661 agantukas on that day, then the total number of agantukas in Bakigram Palace on that day would be 25761 (39 x 661).
Response:  If there were 92 agantukas in Bakinigham Pales on the day after a good meal, and if there were 419 agantukas before that, then how many people had visited Bakinigham Pales since the previous day?
"Response:  If there were 512 agantukas in the Bakinigham Palace on that day, and if there were 471 agantukas on the previous day, then the number of agantukas who came to the palace during the last 89 days can be calculated as follows:

Number of Agantukas = Total number of Agantukas - Number of Agantukas on Previous Day
= 512 - 471
= 41

Therefore, during the last 89 days, 41 agantukas visited the Bakinigham Palace."
Response:  If the number of agnati in the previous day was 191 and there were 705 agnati in the Bakinigham Pales on that day, then the difference between the two numbers is 514 (705 - 191 = 514). Therefore, during the last 245 days, the number of agnati in Bakinigham Pales increased by 514.
Response:  The number of grams of momo required for the next activity is 159 grams. If a total of 628 grams of momo are required, then how many grams of momo did he have before starting the next activity? Answer: 469 grams.
Response:  The given information can be used to find out the number of grams of moisture required for each potato. Let's assume that there are x grams of moisture in each potato. Since there are 49 different types of potatoes, the total amount of moisture required is 49 x 49 = 2371 grams. If the actual amount of moisture in each potato is less than 288 grams (which is the maximum amount required), then the difference between the actual and required amounts will give us the number of grams of moisture present in each potato. So, if the actual amount of moisture in each potato is y grams, we can calculate the number of grams of moisture present in each potato as follows: Number of grams of moisture in each potato = Actual amount of moisture in each potato - Maximum amount of moisture required = y - 288 = x / 49 Where x is the number of grams of moisture required per potato, which is equal to 2371 grams divided by 49. Therefore, the number of grams of moisture present in each potato is x / 49.

"Response:  The required amount of moisture in the soil for growing wheat is 20%. If there are currently 11 grams of moisture per kilogram of soil and the total requirement for growing wheat is 492 grams per kilogram, then how much moisture is required to grow wheat?

Answer: To grow wheat, a total of 492 grams of moisture per kilogram of soil is required. Since there are currently 11 grams of moisture per kilogram of soil, an additional 481 grams (492 - 11) of moisture is needed to meet the requirements for growing wheat."
"Response:  The number of barrels of oil that can be filled in 6 days is given by the equation:

Number of barrels = Total amount of oil / Time taken to fill one barrel

In this case, the total amount of oil is 90 barrels and the time taken to fill one barrel is 15 minutes (as mentioned in the problem). Therefore, we can calculate the number of barrels that can be filled in 6 days as follows:

Number of barrels = 90 barrels / 15 minutes/barrel = 600 barrels

So, in 6 days, 600 barrels of oil can be filled."
Response:  If 266 people eat 90 drums of angora in 5 days, then on an average, how many angoras will each person eat per day?
"Response:  If the rate of increase in the number of drums of angora wool produced per day is constant, then the total number of drums of angora wool that will be produced in 146 days can be calculated as follows:

Total number of drums = Total number of days / Rate of increase
= 146 days / 244 drums/day (average daily production)
= 580 drums (approximately)

Therefore, approximately 580 drums of angora wool will be produced in 146 days at a constant rate of increase."
"Response:  To find the number of barrels of oil that will be filled in 77 days, we need to divide the total amount of oil (100 drams + 221 drams) by the number of days (77 days). So, the answer is:

Number of barrels = Total amount of oil / Number of days
= 321 drams / 77 days
= 4.26 barrels per day
Therefore, approximately 4.26 barrels of oil will be filled every day for 77 days."
"Response: 58 दिनों में अंगूर के कितने ड्रम भर जाएंगे?

"Response:  The number of tukdes of junk mail that each house in a block of 6 houses will receive if one daakiya is distributing them equally among all the houses in the block can be calculated as follows:

Total number of houses = 6
Number of tukdes per house = Total number of houses / Number of daakias (1)
= 6 / 1 = 6

Therefore, each house in the block will receive 6 tukdes of junk mail."
Response:  The number of houses in each block is given by the equation: Number of houses = Total number of houses / Number of blocks. In this case, the total number of houses is 108 (as given in the question), and there are 5 blocks. Therefore, the number of houses in each block is: Number of houses/Blocks = 108/5 = 21.6. So, there are approximately 21.6 houses in each block.
"Response:  Total number of tukdars required to cover each block = Number of houses in the block x Number of tukdars required per house / Number of daakis available
Total number of tukdars required for all blocks = Total number of tukdars required for one block x Number of blocks
Therefore, total number of tukdars required for all blocks = 20 x 32/5 = 1600 tukdars."
Response: 245
Response: 16 घर हैं
Response:  The number of janks that the dairy can deliver to each house in a block of 81 houses is given by the formula: Number of janks = Total number of houses / Number of houses per block. In this case, there are 12 houses in each block, so the number of janks that the dairy can deliver to each house is: Number of janks = 81 houses / 12 houses/block = 6.75 janks per house. Therefore, the dairy can deliver 6.75 janks of milk to each of the 81 houses.
Response:  The total number of jute bags that the dairy should distribute among the 16 blocks is 252 (16 x 4). Since each block has 17 houses, the total number of jute bags required for all 17 houses in each block is 16 (17 x 1 = 16). Therefore, the total number of jute bags required for all 16 blocks is 252 x 16 = 4096.

Group 2: 6 ants - 2 bulbuls = 4 ants
Group 3: 4 ants - 2 bulbuls = 2 ants
Group 4: 2 ants - 2 bulbuls = 0 ants

Therefore, there will be a total of 6 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 12 ants in the four groups."
Response:  The number of groups Rebeka can form with 3 or fewer members is 3! = 6. Since each group must have at least one gobber and at most 4 gobbers, the maximum number of gobbers in any group is 4. Therefore, there are a total of 6 x 4 = 24 gobbers that Rebeka can include in her collection.
"Response:  The number of groups Rebeka can form with 6 members each is 30.

Explanation:

Rebeka has a total of 18 apples and 66 gumballs. To form a group of 6 members each, we need to divide these candies equally among the groups.

Since there are 30 groups in total (based on the divisibility of 18 by 6), Rebeka can form 30 groups of 6 members each."
Response:  The number of committees that Rebeka can form with 3 members each is 3^3 = 27 committees.

"Response:  If the number of rounds played in each game is given by a function f(x), where x is the number of trials, then we can find the average number of runs scored per game as follows:

Let's assume that the number of rounds played in each game is given by f(x) = 3x + 10.

If the player has played 78 games, then the total number of rounds played is 78 x 3 = 234.

So, the average number of runs scored per game is (234 / 78) = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  The number of Motis required to win the game = (Number of friends - Number of losses) / 2. In this case, the number of Motis required to win the game = (4 - 32) / 2 = 16. So, Emily needs 16 Motis to win the game.
Response:  Emily had 40 motes in total.
Response: 20
Response:  The number of motes required to win the game is 7.
Response:  Emily had 20 motes in total. She lost 4 motes in each of the 5 games she played, so she had 20 - 4 x 5 = 16 motes left.
Response:  Emily has already won 48 matches out of 72, so she can win at most 24 more matches.
"Response:  Let X be the number of Motis Emily had in each loss. Since she won 20 losses out of 43, we can write:

X + (43 - 20) = 5

Simplifying, we get:

X = 13

Therefore, Emily had 13 Motis in each loss."
Response:  If Emily has played 44 games against her 4 friends and won 26 of them, then she must have lost 18 games (i.e., 44 - 26 = 18). Since each game consists of 2 motes, Emily must have lost a total of 36 motes (i.e., 18 x 2 = 36) in those 18 losses.

"Response:  According to the information given in the passage, Helen made 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 kishmish cookies yesterday. Today, she made 85 rice cakes and 403 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Helen made is:

144 + 397 = 541 cookies

So, Helen made a total of 541 cookies."
"Response:  The number of chocolate chips in each batch of cookies is given by the following formula:

Number of chocolate chips = (Total number of cookies) / (Number of cookies per batch)

From the problem statement, we know that Helena made 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and today she has 231 remaining. So, the total number of cookies she made is:

Total number of cookies = 19 + 231 = 250

Now, we need to find out how many chocolate chips are in each batch of cookies. From the problem statement, we know that Helena used 237 cups of sugar for making the cookies. Since each cup of sugar makes approximately 4 cookies, we can estimate the number of cookies per batch as follows:

Number of cookies per batch = Total number of cookies / Number of cups of sugar used
= 250 / 237
= 1.06

So, there are approximately 1.06 cookies per batch. Now, let's find out how many chocolate chips are in each batch of cookies:

Number of chocolate chips = Total number of cookies x Number of cookies per batch
= 250 x 1.06
= 265

Therefore, Helena has 265 chocolate chips left after making 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and today."

Money stolen = Total value of coins - Value of coins in equation (1)
= 122 - (x - 64)
= 122 - 30
= 92 rupees
Therefore, 92 rupees were stolen from the box."
Response:  If 40 magar machch were hidden in the pineapple, then there would be 53 magar machch (93 - 40) and 51 saanp (97 - 46).
"Response:  Total number of Magar Machch = 3 + 75 - 82 = 6 
So, 6 Magar Machchs were not hidden in the box."
"Response:  Total number of animals in the pit = 79

Explanation:

The total number of animals in the pit is given as 79. If 24 saanp and 51 magarmachch were hidden inside the pit, then the total number of animals that were not hidden inside the pit would be 79 - (24 + 51) = 24. Therefore, there were 24 animals that were not hidden inside the pit."

Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his bag yesterday. If he gave away 56 tomatoes today and has 41 left now, then the number of tomatoes he gave away is equal to the number of tomatoes he had left after giving them away. So, the answer is 56.
"Response:  Total number of tomatoes = 90 + 154 - 50 = 104

Explanation:

The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his bag yesterday. Today, he has added 154 more tomatoes to the bag, but he has also given away 50 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes that the farmer has now is 104 (90 + 154 - 50)."
"Response:  If the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his bag, and he took out 172 potatoes, then how many tomatoes and potatoes are left with him?

Solution:
Let's first count the number of tomatoes and potatoes that the farmer has after taking out 172 potatoes.

Tomatoes: 175 - 172 = 3
So, there are 3 tomatoes left with the farmer.

Potatoes: 77 - 172 = -95
So, there are -95 potatoes left with the farmer (since negative numbers indicate a decrease).

Therefore, the farmer has 3 tomatoes and -95 potatoes left with him."
"Response:  If the farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his bag, and he took out 53 tomatoes, then how many tomatoes and potatoes are left with him?

Solution:
Let's count the number of tomatoes and potatoes that the farmer has after taking out 53 tomatoes.

Tomatoes: 177 - 53 = 124
Potatoes: 12 - 0 = 12

So, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left with him."
Response:  If the farmer had 105 bags of wheat and 71 bags of tomatoes, and he added 137 more bags of tomatoes, then there are 64 bags of tomatoes left.
Response:  If each plank of wood requires 2 nails to secure it, and there are 4 planks in total, then John needs 8 nails (2 x 4 = 8) to secure the entire wall.
Response:  John needs 24 kilos of wood to build a wall around his house. If each piece of wood requires 17 pieces of nails to secure it, and he wants to leave 8 pieces of wood unnailed for decoration or repair purposes, then he will need 320 nails (17 x 24).
Response:  John needs 27 tiles (3 x 9) to cover the entire wall.
"Response:  The number of bricks required to build a wall depends on several factors such as the height and length of the wall, the thickness of the wall, and the type of brick used. However, based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate the approximate number of bricks needed for each section of the wall.

For the large bricks (bada), if they are stacked one upon another, then 15 tukda (smaller bricks) will be required to cover an area of 1 square meter. Therefore, to cover a wall that is 20 feet high (6 meters) and 30 feet long (9 meters), we will need 6 x 9 = 54 tukda of small bricks.

For the small bricks (chhoti), 5 tukda will be required to cover an area of 1 square meter. So, to cover the same wall, we will need 5 x 9 = 45 small bricks.

Therefore, the total number of bricks required to build the wall is: 54 + 45 = 99 bricks."
Response:  The number of John's kiln bricks required to build a wall is 16. Each brick requires two tufts of clay to be securely fastened, and there are 16 tiles in total that will be used for the wall.

"Response:  The number of screws in the collection is 4502 and there are 4276 rubbers as well. If we divide them into 154 groups, each group will have approximately how many screws and rubbers?

Answer:

Let's assume that the total number of screws and rubbers in the collection is x. Since there are 4502 screws and 4276 rubbers, we can write the equation:

x = 4502 + 4276

Now, let's divide these items into 154 groups. Each group will contain a certain number of screws and rubbers, which we can call y. We know that the total number of screws and rubbers in each group is equal to the total number of screws and rubbers in the collection divided by the number of groups. So, we can write:

y = x / 154

Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get:

y = (4502 + 4276) / 154

Simplifying this expression, we get:

y = 2839

So, each group contains approximately 2839 screws and rubbers."
