Tiffany collected boxes of dairy products until reuse. On Monday, she had 8 boxes. She found 10 packages of dairy products the day after and 4 packages the day after that. So, how many boxes did she find after Monday?
To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the question. We know that Tiffany found 10 packages of dairy products the day after Monday, which means she found 10/8 = 1.25 boxes of dairy products per day (since there are 8 days between Monday and the day after).
Similarly, we know that she found 4 packages of dairy products the day after that, which means she found 4/8 = 0.5 boxes of dairy products per day (since there are 8 days between the day after Monday and the next Monday).
So, in total, Tiffany found 1.25 + 0.5 = 1.75 boxes of dairy products after Monday. Therefore, the answer is 1.75."

"Response: 27
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Rachel has three apple trees.
She picked 8 apples from each of her trees.
Now, all the trees have 9 apples left.
To find out how many apples were originally on all the trees, we can use the fact that Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree. So, if there were x apples on each tree initially, then after she picked 8 apples, there would be x - 8 apples left. Since all the trees now have 9 apples left, we can set up the equation:
x - 8 = 9
Solving for x, we get:
x = 27
So, there were 27 apples on all the trees initially."

Response:  There are currently 946 girls in the school (902 - 44 = 946).
Response:  There are more girls than boys at the school by 89 (632 - 410 = 222) students.
"Response: 540
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of girls who attended school = 682
Number of boys who attended school = 8
Total number of students attending school = Number of girls + Number of boys
= 682 + 8
= 690
Now, let's find out how many girls are left in the school after some students graduated or transferred to another school:
Original number of girls in the school = Total number of students attending school - Number of girls who graduated/transferred
= 690 - x
where x is the number of girls who graduated or transferred.
We know that 682 girls attended school initially, so we can set up the equation:
x = 682 - 540
Solving for x, we get:
x = 142
Therefore, there are 142 girls left in the school now."

"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then he did 25 more crunches than push-ups (58 - 33 = 25). Therefore, Zachary did 14 more push-ups than crunches (33 - 14 = 19)."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, which means that if Zachary did 5 push-ups, he did 22 fewer push-ups than David (27 - 5 = 22). Additionally, we know that Zachary did 17 crunches, so if he did fewer crunches than push-ups, then he did 34 more crunches than push-ups (17 - 5 = 34). Therefore, the answer is 34."

* After serving 9 customers, he still had 12 customers.
* Therefore, the number of customers he had at the beginning was equal to the number of customers he had after serving 9 customers minus the number of customers he had after serving 9 customers.

So, we can set up an equation based on this reasoning:

Number of customers at start = Number of customers after serving 9 customers - Number of customers after serving 9 customers

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of customers at start = 12 - 9
= 3

Therefore, the tjener had 3 customers at the beginning."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paul had 108 books and 55 pens initially.
* After selling some books and pens in a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens left.

To find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had left (66) from the initial number of books he had (108):

108 - 66 = 42

So, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale."
"Response: 34

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paul had 51 books and 106 pens before selling some books and pens in a garage sale.
* After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.

So, if he sold x pens in the garage sale, we can set up the equation:

51 + 106 = 82 (books)
x + 14 = 106 (pens)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 34

"Response: 40 books
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books and pencils in the garage sale, Paul had 13 books and 23 pencils left. If he sold x books in the garage sale, then he would have had 13 - x books left. Since he had 95 books to start with, we can set up the equation:

13 - x = 95

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40

Therefore, Paul sold 40 books in the garage sale."
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, after selling some books and pencils in a garage sale, Paul had 113 books and 19 pencils left. If he sold 50 pencils in the garage sale, that means he sold 50 - 19 = 31 pencils."

To find out how many bottle caps he has now, we need to multiply the number of bottle cap holes by the number of bottle caps per hole. Since there are 53 bottle cap holes and each hole contains 12 bottle caps, Danny now has 630 bottle caps (53 x 12 = 630)."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 flaskehuller in the park and smashed 35 old bottles. This means he has 22 flaskehullers left in his collection after smashing some of them. To find out how many more flaskehullers Danny found than he smashed, we need to subtract the number of flaskehullers he smashed from the total number of flaskehullers he found: 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, Danny found 1 more flaskehuller in the park than he smashed."
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny found 30 flaskehuller in the park and smashed 63 old beetles. This means he had 30 - 63 = -33 fewer beetles after smashing them than he found in the park. Therefore, the number of additional flaskehullers Danny smashed is equal to the number of flaskehullers he found in the park minus the number of beetles he smashed, which is 30 - (-33) = 19."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny started with 5 flaskehuller (flaskeborre). The passage states that he found 22 flaskeborster and 8 pakninger in the park, which means he now has 28 flaskeborre. Additionally, the passage states that he had 63 pakninger in his collection, which is equal to 63/2 = 31 flaskehuller. Therefore, Danny had 5 + 31 = 36 flaskehuller at the beginning of the story."

Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 27 flaskeborster and 43 pakninger in his collection before he found 10 more flaskeborsters and 62 paper clips in the park. Therefore, the number of additional pakningers Danny has now is: 43 - 27 = 16."
Response: 190
"Response: 25
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 25 flaskehuller in his collection before he found some bottle caps in the park. If he now has 32 flaskehuller in his collection, that means he found 7 more flaskehuller in the park (32 - 25 = 7)."
Response: 30
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 new flaskehuller in the park, which is 10 more than the 40 he threw away. Therefore, the difference between the number of flaskehullers Danny found and the number he threw away is 10."

Explanation: According to the passage, Olivia took $148 from the money box. After she visited the supermarket, there were $159 left. Therefore, the amount that Olivia spent is $148."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Olivia had $3 in her drawing book.
* She took $49 more from an ATM.
* After visiting a supermarket, there was $49 left.

So, the total amount of money Olivia had is:
$3 + ($49 x 2) = $3 + $98 = $101

Now, let's find out how many more dollars she collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket:
$101 - $49 = $52

Therefore, Olivia collected $52 more dollars at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket."

$144 - $14 = $130

Therefore, Olivia spent $130 more than she collected at the ATM ($91) in the supermarket."
"Response: 57 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, after Olivia visited the supermarket and spent $26 there, she had $106 in her sketchbook. Then, she went to an exhibition room where she spent $49. So, if she spent $49 in the exhibition room, she must have spent $57 in the supermarket."

Therefore, the answer is 39."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 5 apps and 23 files left on his phone. To find out how many apps he deleted, we can divide the number of apps he started with (16) by the number of apps he had left after deleting some (5). This gives us 4 as the number of apps he deleted."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 3 apps and 7 filers left on his phone. To find out how many files he deleted, we can divide the number of files he had left by the number of files he had before deleting some apps and files. In this case, he had 21 files before deleting some apps and files, and he had 7 files left after deleting them, so he deleted 14 files (21 - 7 = 14)."
"Response: 3
Explanation:  According to the question, after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 21 apps and 4 files remaining on his phone.

Therefore, Dave deleted 4 apps from his phone."
Response: 5 files.
"Response: 3
Explanation:  According to the question, after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 5 files and 12 apps left on his phone. To find out how many more apps he has than files, we need to subtract the number of files from the number of apps. So, the difference between 12 apps and 5 files is 7 (12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files on his phone."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some apps and files, Dave had 24 files and 2 apps remaining on his phone. To find out how many more files he has than apps, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files. So, 24 (files) - 2 (apps) = 22 more files than apps."

Explanation:  To find out how many more baseball cards than 10 cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of 10 cards she gave away from her original total number of baseball cards. According to the problem, Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 10-cent cards, for a total of 665 cards. If she gave away 10 cards, she would have 655 cards left (309 baseball cards + 356 10-cent cards - 10). So, Nell has 271 more baseball cards than 10 cards."
"Response: 397
Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 10-card packs before giving some of her cards away. This means she had a total of 460 cards (246 + 214). After giving some of her cards away, she had 404 baseball cards and 495 10-card packs left, which is a total of 899 cards (404 + 495). Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards and 10-card packs that Nell has now and the number she had before giving any cards away is 899 - 460 = 439. Since 10-cards are worth more than baseball cards, this difference represents the number of additional 10-card packs that Nell has after giving some of her baseball cards away."

"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were initially 20 children on the bus before two more joined at the bus stop. Therefore, there were 20 children on the bus before the bus stopped."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's assume that there were initially 43 children in the bus. When some of them got off at the bus stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. To find out how many children stepped off the bus, we can subtract the number of children remaining in the bus from the initial number of children: 43 - 21 = 9. Therefore, 9 children stepped off the bus at the bus stop."
"Response: 9
Explanation:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 41 children in the bus.
* Some children got off at the bus stop, leaving 18 children behind.

To find out how many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than are now, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children:

Number of children who got off = 41 - 18 = 23

So, there were 23 more children on the bus before the bus stop than there are now."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, 10 children got off the bus at the stop point, and there were already 16 children on the bus. Therefore, the total number of children who came onto the bus at the stop point is 10 + 16 = 26."
"Response: 5
Explanation:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Der var fem børn i bussen."" means that there were 5 children already on the bus.
* ""ved busstoppestedet gik 63 børn af bussen"" means that 63 children got off the bus at the stop.
* ""Nogle flere gik på bussen"" means that some more children boarded the bus.

Now, let's calculate the total number of children on the bus:

Total number of children on the bus = Number of children already on the bus + Number of children who got off the bus + Number of children who boarded the bus
= 5 + 63 - X
where X is the number of children who boarded the bus.

Substituting the values, we get:
Total number of children on the bus = 5 + 63 - X
= 78 - X

So, there were 78 children on the bus, including the 5 children who were already on it and the unknown number of children who boarded it. Therefore, the answer to the question is 5."
"Response: 40
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 36 children in the bus.
* When the bus stopped at the pickup point, 68 children got off the bus.
* Therefore, the number of children left on the bus was 36 - 68 = -32.
* The question states that ""Several"" children went onto the bus, which means some children got on the bus after it stopped.
* So, the total number of children who got on the bus is positive, let's say x.
* Since there are already 12 children on the bus, and x is the number of new children who got on, we can write: x + 12 = 40 (total number of children on the bus).
* Solving for x, we get: x = 28.

Therefore, there were 40 children on the bus in total, including both those who were initially on the bus and those who got on after it stopped."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:

* There were initially 22 children in the bus.
* When they reached the bus stop, 40 children got off the bus.
* So, there were 22 - 40 = 18 children left in the bus.
* Two children stepped off the bus at the bus stop.
* Therefore, the number of children remaining in the bus after two children stepped off is 18 - 2 = 16 children."
Response: 54 (found by subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus).
"Response: 10
Explanation:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 23 children in the bus.
* When they reached the stop, 24 children got off the bus.
* So, the number of children left on the bus was 8 (23 - 24).
* Now, let's find out how many more children came off the bus than went on it:
	+ Children who got off the bus = 24
	+ Children who remained on the bus = 8
	+ Difference = 24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, there were 16 more children who came off the bus than went on it."

Explanation:
The statement ""Hvis han solgte 51 af dem"" means ""If he sold 51 of them"". The word ""flere"" in this context means ""more"", so we can translate it as ""de han lavede"". Therefore, the number of bags that Baker made is 42 (not 133)."
"Response: 108
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Bageren lavede 54 kager and sold some of them. If he still has 13 kags left, that means he sold 41 kagers (54 - 13 = 41)."
"Response: 103
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* ""Han solgte 145 af dem."" means that he sold 145 kags.
* ""Hvor mange kager lavede Baker?"" means ""How many kegs did Baker make?""
* The statement ""Han stadig har 72 kager tilbage"" means ""He still has 72 kegs left"".

Now, let's use algebra to solve for the number of kegs made by Baker:

Number of kegs made by Baker = Total number of kegs sold - Number of kegs remaining
= 145 - 72
= 73

Therefore, Baker made 73 kegs."

"Response: 25
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, Baker has 25 kags left after buying and selling some. This is calculated by subtracting the number of kagers he sold (86) from the total number of kagers he had (173), which gives us 87 - 86 = 25."
"Response: 28
Explanation: According to the passage, Baker bought 167 new bags and sold 89 bags. Therefore, he purchased more bags than he sold by 78 (167 - 89 = 78)."

Response: 100
Response: 4
"Response: 57

Explanation:
Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to give away so that she has 31 Sony games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has (132) from the total number of Sony games she owns (184). This gives us 57 Sony games that Kelly needs to give away."
"Response: 29
Explanation:
Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 of them. To determine how many she needs to give away so that she has six matches left, we can subtract the number of games she found from the total number of games she has.

80 - 31 = 49
So, Kelly needs to give away 49 games to have six matches left."

Explanation: According to the problem statement, Randy had 140 blocks in total when he started building his tower. This is because if he used 52 blocks to build each level of the tower and there are 38 blocks left over after finishing the tower, then he must have had 52 x 3 = 156 blocks initially (since there are three levels of the tower). However, since there are 38 blocks left over, this means that Randy actually had 156 - 38 = 118 blocks at the beginning."
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, Randy has 97 blocks and uses some of them to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left after he builds the tower, then he must have used 15 blocks to build the tower."

Response: 40 + 16 = 56
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 37 blocks to build three structures (a tower and two houses). To build the tower, he used 33 blocks, which means he used 4 more blocks for the tower than for each house. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for each house is 4."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 86 blocks to build eighty-six blocks and 79 blocks to build a tower. Therefore, he used 13 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
"Response: 13
Explanation: If Randy has 36 blocks to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have 0 blocks left over. If he had 59 blocks in total, that means he used 23 blocks (59 - 36 = 23). So there are 13 blocks left over."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 50 blocks to build the tower and 20 blocks to build the house. Therefore, he used 35 more blocks for the tower than for the house (50 - 20 = 35)."
"Response: 11
Explanation: According to the question, Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for the house than for the tower, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: 89 - 63 = 26. So, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."

"Response: 13

Explanation:
The question states that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series ""The Stupid School"". If you have read 19 of the films and seen 16 of the books, then you have read more films than books. Therefore, the difference between the number of films read and books read is 13 (19 - 16)."

Explanation: According to the question, Dave won 19 tickets and used 12 of them to buy toys and 7 of them to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets Dave used to buy toys than he did to buy clothes, we can subtract the number of tickets he used for toys from the total number of tickets he won: 12 (toys) - 19 = -7. So, Dave used 7 fewer tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys and 18 tickets to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets he used to buy clothes than toys, we need to subtract the number of tickets he used for toys from the total number of tickets he had (13).

So, they earned $4,099 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game."
"Response: 115

Explanation:
The information given in the question is that they sold 242 T-shirts in total during both games. If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 127 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game (242 - 115 = 127)."
"Response:  $854

Explanation:
To find out how much money they made from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to subtract the number of T-shirts sold during that game from the total number of T-shirts sold overall. So, if they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and sold a total of 163 T-shirts in both games combined, then they made $854 in revenue from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game."

Response:  The water is 90 feet deep beyond Dean's height of 9 feet.
"Response: 3 meters
Explanation: According to the passage, ""Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron."" This means that if Ron is standing in water that is 4 meters deep, then Dean would be standing in water that is 6 meters (4 + 2) deep. Therefore, the depth of the water was 3 meters (6 - 2)."
Response:  The depth of the water is five times Ron's height, which means it is 30 feet (5 x 6 = 30) deep. Since Dean is three meters shorter than Ron, the depth of the water relative to Dean is 30 - 3 = 27 feet.
"Response: 20 meters
Explanation:
Dean is 1 meter higher than Ron, so Dean's height is 1 + 1 = 2 meters above the water level. Since the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, the depth of the water is 15 x 2 = 30 meters. If Ron stands on 4 meters, then the depth of the water is 30 - 4 = 26 meters."
"Response: 20 meters
Explanation:
Ron is 3 meters higher than Dean, so if Dean stands at 4 meters above sea level, then Ron stands at 7 meters (3 + 4) above sea level. Since the water depth is 16 times Ron's height, it means that the water depth is 16 x 7 = 112 meters deep. Therefore, the answer is 20 meters."

Response:  They had 6 bed(s).
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Paige and her mother planted 32 seeds in total. If they spread an equal number of seeds in each flower bed, then they planted 4 seeds in each flower bed (32 / 8 = 4)."
Response: 20 (Matthew had 20 kicks).
Response: 4
Response:  Each of Matthews friends got 3 kicks (since there are 5 friends and each friend got 3 kicks). So, in total, 15 kicks were given away, leaving Matthew with 10 kicks remaining.
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 kicks and gave some of them to his three friends. Let's assume that he gave an equal number of kicks (i.e., 8) to each friend. Then, the total number of kicks given by Matthew is 24 / 3 = 8. Since Matthew still has 17 kicks left after giving them away, he must have given 8 + 17 = 25 kicks in total."
Response: 50 (kicks) and 68 (cakes).
Response: 15
Response: 35 (kiks + kager)
"Response: 4
Explanation:  If Matthew gave ""lige mange kiks"" to his 18 friends and he had 36 kiks in total, then each friend must have received a number of kiks that is a fraction of the total number of kiks Matthew had. Since there are 18 friends, we can write the equation:

Number of kiks each friend got = Total number of kiks / Number of friends

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Number of kiks each friend got = 36 / 18 = 4
Therefore, each friend got 4 kiks from Matthew."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew gave each of his friends 4 small cakes (seks småkager). If he had 36 cookies (kiks), then he gave 36 / 4 = 9 friends cookies."
Response: 5 each
Response: 5
"Response: 16
Explanation: If Matthew gave out ""lige mange"" (i.e., many) kicks and cakes to his 4 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of both kicks and cakes. Therefore, each friend received 16 kicks and 16 cakes in total."
"Response: 3
Explanation: If Matthew gave out ""lige mange"" (a lot) of cookies and cakes to his 4 friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of cookies and cakes. Therefore, each friend received 3 cookies and 3 cakes."

Response: 365 (Debbie bought 365 water bottles)
Response: 49 (Debbie drank 49 bottles of water per day)
Response: 309 (Debbie has 309 water bottles left)
"Response: 6 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debbie consumed 144 bottles of water per day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left after consuming them, that means she had 157 - 144 = 13 bottles remaining at the end of the sixth day. Therefore, the number of days Debbie consumed water is equal to the number of days she had bottles remaining, which is 6 days."
"Response: 20 days
Explanation:
Debbie bought 88 water bottles and 13 soda bottles when they were on sale. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles per day, how many days will the supplies last? To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles consumed per day. In this case, there are 88 water bottles and 13 soda bottles, so if Debbie consumes 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles per day, it will take 20 days for the supplies to run out (88 / 4 = 22 days, but since you can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to 20 days)."
Response:  The number of days that the sodas would last is 4/312 = 0.125 days or approximately 1 day and 6 hours.
Response: 43 days (12 flasks x 3 flasks per day = 36 flasks / 30 days = 43 days)
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 water bottles. If she drinks 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles per day, then the number of days the water bottles will last is:

Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles consumed per day
= 180 / 15
= 3 days
Therefore, the water bottles will last for 3 days."

Response:  Faye has 598 blyants (30 x 71 + 24).
"Response: 378

Explanation:
Faye has placed her sticks in 16 rows with 6 sticks in each row. Therefore, she has 6 x 16 = 96 sticks in total. Since each stick is either blue or yellow, there are 96 / 2 = 48 blue sticks and 48 / 2 = 24 yellow sticks. So, Faye has 48 blue sticks and 24 yellow sticks."
"Response: 352
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The school has 21 classrooms.
* There are 98 students in the school.
* There are 7 school buses.

Now, let's calculate the number of seats available in each bus:

Number of seats per bus = Number of students / Number of buses
= 98 / 7
= 14

So, there are 14 seats available in each bus."
Response:  There are 84 classrooms and 95 school buses with 118 seats per bus, so there are in total 84 x 95 = 7900 students at the school.
"Response: 3
Explanation: To find out how many school buses are needed to take the trip, we need to divide the total number of students (66 x 6 = 390) by the number of seats in each bus (6). So, there will be 3 buses required for the trip."
"Response: 2
Explanation: Since there are 58 students in total and each class has the same number of students (87), we can assume that each bus will have 13 students (58 / 87). Therefore, two buses will be needed to transport all the students on the field trip."
Response:  There are 120 students in total at the school and each class has the same number of students as there are seats available on the buses, which is 84 seats per bus. Therefore, there will be 120/84 = 1.45 classes per bus.
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 102 students in the school and 8 seats per bus, then the number of buses needed for an excursion with 22 non-participating students is 3."
"Response: 74
Explanation: If there are 102 classrooms and 11 students in the school, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is 102 - 11 = 91. Since there are 99 seats available on each bus, the total number of students who can go on the field trip is 91 x 99 = 899. However, if 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then the actual number of students who will go on the field trip is 899 - 8 = 891."
"Response: 3
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for an outing with 111 students from a school with 72 classrooms, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available in each bus. Since there are three seats per bus, we can calculate that 3 buses will be required to transport all the students."
"Response: 352
Explanation: To find out how many students can fit in each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students (92) by the number of buses (46). This gives us an average of 2 students per bus. Since there are 17 classrooms, we can assume that each classroom has approximately 2 students per bus, which means that each bus can hold around 352 students (2 x 2 = 4 students per classroom x 17 classrooms)."
Response: 9 x 9 = 81 kugler.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Haley gave 5 kuglers to each of the 5 boys, so she gave a total of 25 kuglers (5 x 5 = 25)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: If Haley has 23 balls and wants to keep 15 for herself, then she will have 8 balls left over (23 - 15 = 8). Therefore, each of the boys will get 9 balls (8 / 7 = 9)."
"Response: 18
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 13 boys playing marbles and 50 boys playing cards. If Haley has 26 marbles, then she must have 26 / 13 = 2 marbles left over for the other boys to play with. Therefore, 18 boys can play with marbles."

Response: 56 days
Response: 1038 pages
"Response: 90
Explanation:
Frank spent six days reading his favorite book, and he read 612 pages in total. Since each chapter has 24 pages, there are 612 / 24 = 25 chapters in the book. Therefore, Frank read one chapter per day, which means he read 25 x 6 = 150 pages per day. Finally, since he spent six days reading, he read 150 pages per day x 6 days = 900 pages in total."
"Response: 1746
Explanation:  The book had 555 pages in total and Frank spent 220 days writing it. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages (5 chapters x 555 pages per chapter = 2775 pages), we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: 2775 pages / 5 chapters = 555 pages per chapter. Therefore, there are 555 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many days Frank spent reading the book. We know that he spent 660 days reading the book and that it had 193 pages (or chapters). Therefore, we can calculate the number of days per chapter as follows:

Number of days per chapter = Total number of days / Number of chapters
= 660 days / 15 chapters
= 44 days per chapter

Now, let's assume that Frank read one chapter every day. So, if he read 15 chapters in total, he must have read 15 x 44 = 660 days.
Therefore, the answer is 27."
"Response: 70
Explanation: If it took Frank 3 days to read through 249 pages in each book and he read one book per day, then he read 249 pages / 1 book = 249 pages/day."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
Let's assume that Frank has read x books. Since each book has 66 pages and it takes him 12 days to read one book, he reads one page per day. Therefore, he reads a total of 66x pages in 12 days. If it takes him 492 days to read all the books, then he has read a total of 66x/492 = 30 books."
"Response: 5.5 days
Explanation:
To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book (112) by the time it took him to finish reading it (16 days). Therefore, he read approximately 5.5 pages per day."
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 8 pages per day and the book had 576 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages left in the book: 8 pages/day = 576 pages / 8 pages/day = 73 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert this to days by dividing by 24: 73 days / 24 hours/day = 20 days. Therefore, it took Frank 20 days to finish reading his favorite book."
"Response: 7.2
Explanation: To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the number of pages in the book (450) by the time he spent reading it (30 days). So, Frank read approximately 7.2 pages per day."
Response: 3 x 594 = 1782 sider.
"Response: 2
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Frank took 664 days to finish reading his favorite book. Since each chapter has 405 pages, and there are two chapters per day, he read one chapter every 332 days. Therefore, he read two chapters per day."

Response: 9 groups.
Response:  The number of groups of bananas in Philip's collection is 140. Each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is 140 x 187 = 26,990 bananas.
Response:  The size of each group is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact sizes of the groups. However, based on the information provided, there are 203 bananas and 63 apples in Philip's collection.
Response:  The size of each group is not specified in the information given, so we cannot determine the exact size of either the banana or apple groups. However, we can calculate the total number of fruits in each group based on the given information. For the bananas, there are 142 / 47 = 3 fruit per group, and for the apples, there are 356 / 178 = 2 fruit per group.
"Response: 392 / 196 = 2
Therefore, there are approximately 2 bananas in each of the 196 groups in Philip's collection."
"Response: 6
Explanation: If there are 180 bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 18, then there must be 6 groups of bananas."
"Response: 156
Explanation: If there are 290 bananas divided into two groups and 87 apples divided into 93 groups, then the total number of items is:

Apples: 87 x 93 = 841
Bananas (Group 1): 290 / 2 = 145
Bananas (Group 2): 290 - 145 = 145
Therefore, the total number of items in Philip's collection is 841 + 145 + 145 = 156."
"Response:  The size of each group is not specified in the information given, so we cannot determine the exact number of apples or bananas in each group. However, we can calculate the total number of apples and bananas in each group based on the provided information.

For apples:
Total number of apples = Number of apple groups x Total number of apples in each group
= 16 groups x 384 apples/group
= 6072 apples

For bananas:
Total number of bananas = Number of banana groups x Total number of bananas in each group
= 345 groups x 192 bananas/group
= 64,600 bananas

Therefore, there are approximately 6072 apples and 64,600 bananas in Philip's collection."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 67 flasks of regular soda and 9 flasks of diet soda. To find out how many more flasks of regular soda than diet soda they had, we can subtract the number of diet soda flasks from the total number of soda flasks: 67 - 9 = 58. Therefore, they had 58 more flasks of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  The number of more bottles of diet soda than regular soda is 49 - 22 = 27.
Response: 70 flasker
Response:  The number of more bottles of regular soda than diet soda is 16 (53 - 42 = 16).
"Response: 9
Explanation: The total number of bottles of cola is 54 + 83 = 137. Since there are more bottles of regular cola (83) than diet cola (54), the difference between the two is 83 - 54 = 29. Therefore, they have 29 more bottles of regular cola than diet cola."
Response: 5 flaskers of diet soda were sold.
"Response: 34
Explanation: The kiosk owner had 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda they had than diet soda, we can subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the total number of soda bottles: 60 - 19 = 41. So, there were 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."

"Response: 31
Explanation:
The total number of bottles of soda is 81 + 60 + 60 = 201 bottles.
Since there are 60 bottles of regular cola and 60 bottles of light cola, we can subtract these from the total to find out how many more bottles of regular cola there are:
201 - 60 - 60 = 81
So, there are 81 more bottles of regular cola than light cola."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 317 guests at Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends visited. This is 40 more than the previous day's number of guests (295). Therefore, the answer is 40."
"Response: 25 x 246 = 6180

Explanation:
To find out how many guests visited Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel and her friends went there, we need to multiply the number of guests who visited the palace the day before by 25 (the number of days since the previous visit). So, if 703 guests visited the palace the day before, then 703 x 25 = 17555 guests visited the palace overall during those 25 days."
"Response: 234
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of guests visiting Buckingham Palace on the day in question is X. Since Rachel found out that there were 100 more guests than the previous day, we can write an equation based on this information:
X = Y + 100 (where Y is the number of guests on the previous day)
Now, according to the question, there were 666 guests on the day in question, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
X = Y + 100 = 666
Solving for Y, we get:
Y = 466
Therefore, there were 466 guests at Buckingham Palace on the day before the day in question."
"Response: 327

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* After a good meal, they went out to see Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that 132 guests came to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last 327 days was 406.

To find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace the day before, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 406 / 327
= 1.25

So, approximately 1.25 million people visited Buckingham Palace the day before."
"Response: 3760
Explanation:
If there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 829 people have visited in total over the last 85 days, then the number of visitors per day is:
Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 9.8
So, there were approximately 9.8 visitors to Buckingham Palace each day over the last 85 days."
"Response:  Let x be the number of guests who visited Buckingham Palace on the day before the day in question (i.e., 57 days ago). Then, we know that there were 557 guests on the day in question and 71 paintings in the palace. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 71 = 557

Solving for x, we get:

x = 486

So, there were 486 guests at Buckingham Palace 57 days before the day in question."
Response: 41 more guests visited Buckingham Palace that day than the previous day.
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before the day in question is 562 (419 + 103).
"Response:  Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace can be represented by the function f(x), where x is the number of days since the last visit. Based on the information given in the question, we know that there were 512 visitors on the day after Rachel and her family had dinner, so we can set up the equation:

f(x + 1) = 512

We also know that there were 471 visitors the day before Rachel and her family visited, so we can use this value as an initial condition:

f(x) = 471

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

f(x) = (x + 1)^2

So, there were 808 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the last 89 days."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
Let's call the number of guests that visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question x.
We know that there were 705 guests on the day, and 191 guests the day before. So, the difference between the number of guests on the two days is:
x - 191 = 705 - 191 = 514
We also know that there were 457 guests the day before that. So, the total number of guests over the past 245 days is:
514 + 457 = 971
Therefore, the number of more guests that visited Buckingham Palace on the day in question than on the previous 245 days is:
971 - 245 = 726
So, the answer is 368."

"Response: 880

Explanation:
The total number of aquariums is given as 196 (74 freshwater and 22 saltwater). Since each aquarium has 46 fish in it, the total number of fish in all the aquariums is:

Freshwater aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium = 74 x 46 = 3352
Saltwater aquariums x Number of fish per aquarium = 22 x 46 = 992
Total number of fish = 3352 + 992 = 4344
Therefore, Tyler has 4344 saltwater fish."

"Response: 370589

Explanation:
To find out how many children will be at home during summer vacation, we need to subtract the number of children who go to camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County. Therefore, if 629424 children go to camp and there are 898051 children in Lawrence County, then 370589 children will be left behind or stay at home."
"Response: 90,857

Explanation:
To find out how many children go to camp during summer vacation, we need to subtract the number of children who are at home from the total number of children in the county. The difference between these two numbers gives us the number of children who go to camp. In this case, 274,865 - 313,473 = 90,857. Therefore, 90,857 children go to camp during summer vacation in Lawrence County."
"Response: 342893

Explanation:
The number of children who will be at home during summer vacation is given as 907611. The other 455682 will go to camp. Therefore, the total number of children in Lawrence County is 907611 + 455682 = 342893."
"Response: 376466

Explanation:
The number of children who went to summer camp is given as 800059. The total number of children in Lawrence County is 828521. To find out how many children were left at home, we can subtract the number of children who went to summer camp from the total number of children in Lawrence County:

Number of children left at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp
= 828521 - 800059
= 376466

Therefore, there were 376466 children left at home in Lawrence County during the summer vacation."
