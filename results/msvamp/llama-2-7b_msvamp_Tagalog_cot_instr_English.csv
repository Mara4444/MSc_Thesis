Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia was playing with 18 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she played with 10 children. So, how many more children did Julia play with on Monday than on Tuesday?  We can solve this problem by subtracting the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  Number of children Julia played with on Monday - Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, there were 8 more children who played with Julia on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia played with 11 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she played with 12 children. So, there were more children who played with her on Tuesday than on Monday. The difference between the number of children who played with her on Tuesday and Monday is 1 child. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  If Julia played with 5 children on Monday and she also played with other children on Tuesday, then we can assume that she played with at least 6 children in total (Monday + Tuesday). Since she played for 15 minutes each time, the total time she spent playing with all the children is:  Time = Number of Children x Duration per Child  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Time = 6 x 15 = 90 minutes
Response:  If Julia played with 7 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 21 children (7 + 14). Since there are 16 children in the group, if Julia played with them all, then she played with half of the group (21 / 16 = 1 3/8).
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday and she played with more than 12 children on Tuesday, then we can say that she played with at least 4 additional children on Tuesday compared to Monday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and she also played with more than 8 children on Monday, then we can conclude that Julia played with at least 6 children on Monday (since 8 is less than 14). So, the answer to the question is 6.
Response:  If Julia played with 17 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 19 children (17 + 2).
Response:  If Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 97 children on Tuesday, then there are 102 children in total that she played with (Monday + Tuesday). So, the number of children who were with her on both days is:  Number of children who were with Julia on both Monday and Tuesday = Total number of children x Percentage of children who were with her on both days  Number of children who were with Julia on both Monday and Tuesday = 102 x 3/4 = 73  Therefore, there were 73 children who were with Julia on both Monday and Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia was with 5 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she was with 15 children. So, in total, Julia was with 20 children (5 + 15). Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia was with 2 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she was with 16 children. So, the number of children she was with on Tuesday is 16 - 2 = 14. Therefore, the answer to the question is 14.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia was with 9 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she was with 45 more children, for a total of 54 children. On Wednesday (Miyerkules), she was with 96 additional children, for a total of 150 children. So, there were more children with Julia on Wednesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), there were 14 children with Julia. On Tuesday (Martes), there were 8 additional children who joined them. So, in total, there were 14 + 8 = 22 children with Julia from Monday to Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia was with 8 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she was with 9 children. So, there were more children with her on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she was with on Monday and Tuesday is 9 - 8 = 1 child.
Response:  If Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday, then she must have played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the number of children Julia played with on Monday is greater than 7. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) More than 7.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she played with 10 children. And on Wednesday (Miyerkules), she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she played with 13 children. And on Wednesday (Miyerkules), she played with 20 children. So, in total, Julia played with 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children during those three days.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia played with 12 children. On Tuesday (Martes), she played with 14 children. The total time spent playing tag was 34 hours. So, we can conclude that...
"Response:  If Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday, then she had more children to play with on Monday than on Tuesday. So, we can say that:

Number of children Julia played with on Monday = 19
Number of children Julia played with on Tuesday = 18

Now, let's find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday:

Difference between number of children on Monday and Tuesday = Number of children on Monday - Number of children on Tuesday
= 19 - 18
= 1

So, there were one more child with Julia on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  According to the question, Julia played with 5 children on Tuesday and 6 children on Monday. So, there are more children who were with her on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she was with on Monday and Tuesday is 1 child. Hence, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  If Julia played with 18 children and she played with 4 of them on Monday, then there were 18 - 4 = 14 other children that she did not play with on Monday. Since she also played with some of these children on Tuesday, we can conclude that there were 14 + 1 = 15 children who played with her on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of children who played with Julia on Tuesday is 15.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Julia played with 6 children. On Tuesday (Miyerkules), she played with 17 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and the number of children she played with on Tuesday is:  6 - 17 = -11. Therefore, there were 11 fewer children playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday.
"Response:  If Bobby consumed x number of spoons at first and then he ate 25 more spoons after that, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 25 = 43
Now, let's solve for ""x"" (the initial number of spoons). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 25:
x/25 = 43/25
x = 10
So, Bobby initially ate 10 spoons of ice cream."
Response:  First, Bobby consumed 28 cups of coffee. After that, he ate 42 more cups. Then, he had another 63 cups of chocolate drink. So, we need to find out how many cups of coffee Bobby drank in total. We can do this by adding up all the amounts he consumed: 28 + 42 + 63 = 133 cups of coffee. Therefore, Bobby drank 133 cups of coffee in total.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby consumed 33 cups of coffee. After that, he ate another 4 cups of coffee. Finally, he drank 14 cups of chocolate drink. So, in total, Bobby consumed 33 + 4 + 14 = 51 cups of coffee and chocolate drink.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby consumed 38 cups of coffee and then he ate another 36 cups. So far, Bobby has consumed a total of 74 cups of coffee. Then, he also ate 16 cups of chocolate. To find out how many more cups of coffee Bobby consumed than chocolate, we need to subtract the number of cups of chocolate from the total number of cups of coffee that Bobby consumed. Therefore, the difference between the number of cups of coffee and chocolate is: 74 - 16 = 58 cups. So, Bobby consumed 58 more cups of coffee than chocolate.
Response:  If Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces, then he has 20 - 34 = -14 pieces left. After that, if he ate another 18 pieces, then he has -14 + 18 = 3 pieces left. So, the number of pieces of candy that Bobby ate is 3.
Response:  If Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 pieces, then he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left. After that, if he eats another 9 pieces, then he has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces left. So, there are 25 pieces of candy left in Bobby's stomach.
Response:  If Bobby had 22 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, then he has less than 22 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces he ate, but let's assume it was x. Then, after eating x pieces, he has 22 - x pieces left. Now, he ate 5 more pieces, so he has 22 - x - 5 = y pieces left. Since he started with 22 pieces, we can set up the equation: 22 = y + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 16. So, Bobby had 16 pieces of candy left after eating 5 pieces. To find out how many pieces he ate initially, we can subtract 16 from 22: 22 - 16 = 6. Therefore, Bobby ate 6 pieces of candy initially.
Response:  If Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate 2 pieces, then he has 17 pieces left (19 - 2 = 17). So there are 17 pieces of candy remaining for him.
"Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have fewer pieces of candy left. Let's say he eats x number of pieces of candy. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

Number of pieces of candy Boby has = 32
Number of pieces of candy Boby eats = x
Total number of pieces of candy Boby has after eating = 32 - x
Now, we are asked how many pieces of candy Bobby eats if he has 20 pieces of candy left after eating. So, we can set up another equation:

Number of pieces of candy Boby eats = Total number of pieces of candy Boby has after eating - Number of pieces of candy Boby has
= (32 - x) - 20
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 12
So, Bobby eats 12 pieces of candy."
Response:  At first, Bobby had 17 cups of rice and he ate 15 cups after that. So, initially, Bobby had 17 - 15 = 2 cups of rice left. Now, we are asked how many cups of rice were left after Bobby ate 15 cups more than what was initially left with him. Therefore, the total number of cups of rice left with Bobby after eating 15 cups more is 2 + (15 x 36) / 100 = 2 + 540 / 100 = 542 cups of rice.
Response:  If Bobby has 23 cups of rice and he gives 30 cups to someone else, then he will have 23 - 30 = -7 cups left. So, there are 7 fewer cups of rice that Bobby has than what he initially had.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons in the park, then we can say that Allan has more balloons than Jake in the park. So, the difference between the number of balloons owned by Allan and Jake is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more balloons owned by Allan than Jake in the park.
Response:  Dala ni Allan ang 2 na balon means that Allan has 2 balls in the park.  Dala ni Jake ang 3 na balon means that Jake has 3 balls in the park. So, we have a total of 5 balls (2 + 3) in the park. Since Jake has more balls than Allan, there are 3 more balls belonging to Jake than to Allan in the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls owned by Jake and Allan is 3.
Response:  If Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls in the park, then the total number of balls in the park is 2 + 3 = 5 balls. So, the answer to your question is 5.
Response:  If Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and he now brings 4 more balloons, then the total number of balloons that Jake has brought to the park is 6 + 4 = 10. So, the correct answer is 10.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 more balls than Allan, then... (1) The total number of balls brought by Allan is 5. (2) The total number of balls brought by Jake is 6 + 5 = 11. So, the difference between the number of balls brought by Jake and Allan is 11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, Jake brought 6 more balls than Allan to the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Allan brought 3 balloons to the park and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park. So, in total, they have 8 balloons (3 + 5). Then, after buying 2 more balloons, Allan has 4 balloons left, so he has a total of 8 + 4 = 12 balloons. Therefore, the number of balloons brought by Allan and Jake to the park is 12.
"Response: 
Allan had 2 balls and then bought 3 more balls in the park. So, he has a total of 5 balls now (2 + 3 = 5).
Jake had 4 balls initially and later bought another ball, so he has a total of 5 balls as well (4 + 1 = 5).
Therefore, there are equal number of balls owned by both Allan and Jake in the park, which is 5 each."
Response:  At first, there were 2 balls in the park with Allan and 6 balls with Jake. After that, Allan bought 3 more balls in the park. So, initially, Jake had 6 - 2 = 4 more balls than Allan in the park.
Response:  At first, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 4 balloons. So, in total, they had 9 balloons (5 + 4 = 9). Then, after buying 3 more balloons, Allan now has 12 balloons (9 + 3 = 12) in the park. Therefore, the number of balloons that Allan brought to the park is 12.
Response:  At first, Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 2 balloons in the park. After that, Jake bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, now Allan has 6 + 2 = 8 balloons, while Jake has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in the park. Therefore, there are 8 - 5 = 3 more balloons left with Allan than with Jake in the park.
Response:  At first, Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons in the park. After that, Jake bought 4 more balloons in the park. So, now Jake has 7 balloons (3 + 4) in the park. In comparison to Allan, Jake has 1 more balloon than Allan (6 - 1 = 5). Therefore, there are 5 more balloons owned by Jake compared to Allan in the park.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake bought 3 more balls after that, then the total number of balls brought to the park is: 5 + 3 = 8. So, Jake brought 8 balls to the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park while Jake brought 5 balloons and 59 balls, then we can say that Allan brought x balloons and y balls to the park. Since Jake brought more than Allan in terms of both balloons and balls, we know that x + y = 59 (the number of balls brought by Jake). Also, since Allan brought fewer balloons than Jake, we know that x < 5 (since Jake brought 5 more balloons than Allan). Therefore, the total number of balloons and balls brought by Allan and Jake to the park is: x + y = 59 (from Jake) and x < 5 (from Allan), so the answer is 54 balloons and 54 balls.
Response:  If Allan has 7 balloons and each of them weighs 0.1 kg, then he has a total weight of 7 x 0.1 = 0.7 kg. Similarly, if Jake has 6 balloons and each of them weighs 0.2 kg, then he has a total weight of 6 x 0.2 = 1.2 kg. Now, let's calculate how much they have in common - the number of kilograms that both Allan and Jake have brought to the park. To do this, we need to find their combined weights: 0.7 + 1.2 = 1.9 kg. So, Allan and Jake together have brought 1.9 kg of balloons to the park.
Response:  If Alan brought 5 balls to the park and he and Jake together brought 6 balls to the park, then the total number of balls brought to the park is 5 + 6 = 11. So, the answer is 11.
Response:  If Jake has 6 balls in the park and he buys 3 more balls after that, then the total number of balls Jake has is 6 + 3 = 9.  Now, let's compare this with Alan who has 2 balls in the park initially and buys 3 more balls later, giving him a total of 5 balls (2 + 3). So, Jake has more balls than Alan in the park.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both subjects. So, if he spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese, then the difference between the two is 6 - 2 = 4 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours more studying English than Chinese.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese per day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent studying English from the time spent studying Chinese. So, if he spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese, then he spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more studying Chinese than English. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than English.
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and additional time for Chinese studies. If he spends 4 hours studying English every day, then he has 4 - 3 = 1 hour more for Chinese studies daily. So, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day for Chinese studies than he does for English studies.
"Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English and some time more than that studying Chinese. If he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, then we can say that... (please select one of the following options)
A. Ryan spends 9 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese.
B. Ryan spends 10 hours studying English and 4 hours studying Chinese.
C. Ryan spends 11 hours studying English and 3 hours studying Chinese.
D. Ryan spends 12 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese."
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and an additional number of hours studying English. If he spends more time studying English than Chinese, then we can say that x > 5, where x is the number of hours Ryan spends studying English. So, if Ryan spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, then x = 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day for 5 days. To find out how many hours he spent studying both subjects altogether, we can multiply the number of hours he spends studying each subject per day by the number of days he studied that subject. So, Ryan spent 6 x 5 = 30 hours studying English and 7 x 5 = 35 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, in total, Ryan spent 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both subjects.
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day for 2 days, then he will have studied English for a total of 12 hours (6 x 2 = 12) and Chinese for a total of 10 hours (5 x 2 = 10). So, in total, Ryan has spent 22 hours studying both subjects (12 + 10 = 22).
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 5 hours and Chinese for 4 hours every day for 6 days, then he has studied English for a total of 30 hours (5 x 6 = 30) and Chinese for a total of 24 hours (4 x 6 = 24). So, in total, Ryan has studied English for 30 hours and Chinese for 24 hours over the course of 6 days.
Response:  If Ryan studies English for 4 hours and Chinese for 6 hours every day, then he spends a total of 10 hours (4 + 6) studying per day.  Since he studies for 86 days in total, he spends a total of 860 hours (10 x 86) studying both languages combined over that period.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day, 7 hours studying Chinese, and 3 hours studying Spanish. To find out how many hours he spends studying all three subjects combined, we can add up these amounts: 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours. So, Ryan spends 16 hours studying English, Chinese, and Spanish altogether.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English, 3 hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per week studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than he does studying Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spends studying English. So, if we do this calculation, we get: Total hours spent studying English = 6 x 24 = 144 hours Total hours spent studying Chinese = 3 x 24 = 72 hours Difference between hours spent studying English and Chinese = Total hours spent studying English - Total hours spent studying Chinese = 144 - 72 = 72 hours Therefore, Ryan spends 72 more hours studying English than he does studying Chinese.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese per day. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish per day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent studying Spanish from the total time spent studying English. So, the difference is:  7 - 4 = 3 hours  Therefore, Ryan spends 3 additional hours studying English compared to Spanish.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese per day. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish per day. To find out how many hours he spends studying Chinese compared to Spanish, we need to subtract the time he spends studying Spanish from the total time he spends studying Chinese. So, if we subtract 4 hours (the time he spends studying Spanish) from 5 hours (the time he spends studying Chinese), we get 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than he does Spanish.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and he spends 2 hours studying Chinese every day, then we can say that he spends a total of 5 hours (3 + 2) studying languages every day. So, if he studies English for 4 days, he will study Chinese for 8 days (5 - 3 = 8).
Response:  If Ryan studies English and Chinese for 7 days straight, he spends 4 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. So in total, he spends 4 + 5 = 9 hours per day studying both languages combined. Therefore, Ryan spends 9 x 7 = 63 hours studying English and Chinese altogether.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans to recycle. The next day, she found 7 more bags with the same capacity as the ones she collected on Monday. How many more bags did she collect than what she saw the next day?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of bags she saw the next day from the total number of bags she collected on Monday:  Number of bags collected on Monday - Number of bags seen the next day = 8 - 7 = 1  So, Tiffany collected 1 more bag than what she saw the next day.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Tiffany collected 7 bags of cans to be recycled. The next day (Kinabukasan), she found an additional 5 bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 7 + 5 = 12 bags of cans. Therefore, there are 5 more bags of cans that Tiffany collected on the next day than she collected on Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany collected 4 bottles on Monday and saw 6 more bottles on Tuesday, then she collected a total of 10 bottles (4 + 6 = 10). So, there were 10 bottles in total that Tiffany saw on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Tiffany collected 30 bottles or lata. If she found 4 more bags of bottles on the next day (Kinabukasan), then the total number of bottles she had is:  Total number of bottles = Number of bottles on Monday + Number of additional bottles found on the next day  Total number of bottles = 30 + 4  Total number of bottles = 34 Therefore, Tiffany has 34 bottles in total.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 10 bags of cans. The next day, she saw 3 more bags of cans and then 7 more bags of cans. So in total, how many bags did she collect?  We know that Tiffany collected 10 bags of cans on Monday, plus 3 bags on the second day, plus 7 bags on the third day. Therefore, the total number of bags she collected is: 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bags.
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans to recycle. The next day, she saw 10 more bags of cans and then 4 more bags the following day. So, in total, how many bags of cans did Tiffany collect after Monday?  We know that Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans on Monday, plus 10 bags the next day, plus 4 bags the following day, for a total of 22 bags of cans collected after Monday. Therefore, the answer is 22.
Response:  Based on the information given in the question, we know that Tiffany collected 3 bags of cans on Monday and found 7 more bags of cans on Tuesday. We also know that she collected 44 bags of bottles on Tuesday. To find out how many bags of cans Tiffany collected in total, we need to add the number of bags she collected on Monday to the number of bags she found on Tuesday. So, the answer is:  Total number of bags of cans = 3 + 7 = 10 bags.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples than green apples are in the basket, we can use the following equation: Number of red apples - Number of green apples = Difference between red and green apples Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of red apples = 17; Number of green apples = 16 So, the difference between the number of red apples and green apples is: 17 - 16 = 1 Therefore, there is one more red apple than green apple in the basket."
Response:  We have 5 pula (balls) in total and there are 11 berde (holes) in the basket. To find out how many balls fit into each hole, we divide the number of balls by the number of holes. In this case, we get: Number of balls per hole = Total number of balls / Number of holes = 5 / 11 = 0.45 or approximately 1/2 ball per hole. Now, let's count the number of balls that are inside the basket: Number of balls inside the basket = Total number of balls - Number of balls outside the basket = 5 - (11 x 0.45) = 5 - 5.25 = 0 balls Since there are no balls inside the basket, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that there are 10 purple peaches in the basket initially. If we add 15 green peaches to the basket, then the total number of peaches in the basket will be:  Initially, there were 10 purple peaches in the basket, so their total count is 10. Now, let's add 15 green peaches to the basket. The total count of all peaches in the basket after adding the new ones is: 10 + 15 = 25. Therefore, there are 25 peaches in the basket now, including both purple and green ones.
Response:  There are three balls in the basket (pulang persik). If there are ten more balls outside the basket (ilang berdeng persik), then there would be a total of thirteen balls inside and outside the basket combined (Tatlong pula at ilang berde na persikyo ang nasa basket). So, the number of balls inside the basket is equal to half of the total number of balls, which is six (6) balls. Therefore, the answer is six (6) balls.
"Response:  We have 7 pulas (or apples) in one basket and 15 delaws (or bananas) in another basket. If there are 8 berries in each of these baskets, then we can calculate how many berries there are altogether as follows:

Number of berries = Number of baskets x Number of berries per basket
= 2 baskets x 8 berries/basket
= 16 berries
Therefore, there are 16 berries in total. So, the answer is 16."
Response:  We have 7 red apples and 7 blueberries in a basket. There are 8 big apples in the basket. So, how many more big apples than small apples are there in the basket?  Therefore, the number of big apples is greater than the number of small apples by 8 - 7 = 1.
Response:  We have 2 pula (red) apples and 6 dilaw (yellow) apples in the basket initially. Then, we added 14 more apples to the basket, which are also yellow. So, the total number of yellow apples is now 6 + 14 = 20. Since there were already 2 red apples in the basket, the total number of red apples remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, the ratio of yellow apples to red apples in the basket is 20:2 or 10:1.
Response:  We have 19 purple grapes and 11 green grapes in the basket. If there are 12 brown grapes near the basket, then we can conclude that each grape has 3 neighbors (brown grapes). So, if we count all the grapes around the basket, including the brown ones, we will get:  Purple grapes = 19 x 3 = 57 Green grapes = 11 x 3 = 33 Brown grapes = 12 x 3 = 36 Total number of grapes = 57 + 33 + 36 = 125 Therefore, there are more than twice as many purple grapes as green grapes in the basket.
Response:  Firstly, we have 6 pulang (red) persik (oranges). Then, there are 90 dilaw (yellow) persik in the basket. Finally, there are 16 berdeng (green) persik in the basket. So, the total number of persik (oranges) in the basket is: 6 + 90 + 16 = 172 persik. Therefore, ilang pula (how many) persik are in the basket? The answer is 172 persik.
Response:  We have 18 purple persimmons and 14 green persimmons in total. Among them, 17 are already inside the basket. So, how many more will be left outside the basket? To find out, we need to subtract the number of persimmons that are already inside the basket from the total number of persimmons available. Therefore, the remaining number of persimmons outside the basket is: 18 - 17 = 1.
Response:  We have 5 pula (red) apples and 14 dilaw (green) apples in total. Since there are 6 berries in the basket, we can assume that each berry represents one apple. Therefore, the number of red apples in the basket is equal to the number of green apples divided by 6. So, the number of red apples in the basket is: 5/6 = 0.83 or 83%. Similarly, the number of green apples in the basket is: 14 x 6 = 84. Thus, there are 84 green apples in the basket.
Response:  May 65 na basket ng mga peaches. Each basket has 7 pulang peaches and 3 berdeng peaches. So, we need to find out how many peaches are in each basket. To do this, we divide the total number of peaches (65) by the number of baskets (65). We get:  Number of peaches per basket = Total number of peaches / Number of baskets = 65 / 65 = 1. Therefore, there is one peach in each basket.
Response:  In one basket, there are 10 small peaches and 18 big peaches, so in total, there are 10 + 18 = 28 peaches in that basket. Since there are 5 baskets, the total number of peaches in all the baskets is 28 x 5 = 140 peaches. Therefore, there are 140 peaches in all the baskets combined.
Response:  We know that there are 16 big peaches in each basket and 18 small peaches in each basket. So, if we multiply the number of big peaches per basket (16) with the total number of baskets (x), we get: x = 16 x 32 = 512 big peaches. Similarly, if we multiply the number of small peaches per basket (18) with the total number of baskets (x), we get: x = 18 x 32 = 576 small peaches. Therefore, the total number of peaches in all the baskets is 512 + 576 = 1092 peaches.
Response:  Each basket has 10 regular peaches and 2 berry peaches. So, in total, there are 10 + 2 = 12 peaches per basket. Since we have 5 baskets, the total number of berry peaches is 12 x 5 = 60. Therefore, there are 60 berry peaches in all.
"Response:  There are 10 peaches in total (4 big and 6 small). If there are 7 peaches per basket, then we can calculate the cost of each basket as follows:
Cost = Number of peaches / Total number of peaches x Price per peach
= 7/10 x $X
Where X is the price per peach. Since there are 4 big peaches and 6 small peaches, we can assume that the price per peach is divided equally between them. So, the cost of one big peach is half the price of one small peach. Therefore, the price per peach is:
Price per peach = ($X / 2) for big peaches and ($X / 3) for small peaches
Substituting this value into the formula above, we get:
Cost = (7/10) x ($X / 2) for big peaches + (7/10) x ($X / 3) for small peaches
Simplifying and solving for X, we get:
$X = $5 per peach
So, if there are 7 peaches in each basket, the cost of each basket of peaches would be:
Cost = $5 x 7 = $35 per basket"
Response:  There are two baskets of peaches. Each basket has 4 big peaches and more than 4 small peaches. If there are 12 peaches in total, then the number of small peaches is 12 - 4 = 8. So, each basket has 4 big peaches and 8 small peaches. Therefore, the price per small peach is $8 / 8 = $1 per small peach.
Response:  We have 16 apples in one basket and 13 of them are peaches. So, there are 16 - 13 = 3 apples left that are not peaches. Therefore, there are 3 berries in the basket.
Response:  The first basket has 19 peaches and 4 berries, so it contains a total of 23 fruits (19 + 4).  If there are 15 baskets in all, then the total number of fruits in all the baskets is 23 x 15 = 345.
Response:  If there are 10 peaches and each basket can hold 4 or 6 peaches, then we need to find out how many baskets of peaches will fit in total. We know that 4 peaches can fit in one basket, so if we have 10 peaches and want to put them in baskets with 4 peaches per basket, we will need 2.5 baskets (10 / 4 = 2.5). Similarly, if we want to put all 10 peaches in baskets with 6 peaches per basket, we will also need 2.5 baskets (10 / 6 = 2.5). Therefore, there will be a total of 2.5 baskets of peaches.
Response:  We have 6 big persimmons (berdeng) and 6 small persimmons (pulang). The number of big persimmons in the basket is equal to the number of small persimmons plus one because there is one big persimmon already in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Big Persimmons = Small Persimmons + 1  Now let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Big Persimmons = 6 + 6 = 12  Therefore, there are 12 big persimmons more than small persimmons in the basket.
Response:  If Jerry has 10 action figures in his room before adding more, and he adds 5 new ones to the collection, then there are now 15 action figures in total (10 original + 5 added). So, if Jerry adds 3 more action figures to the collection, there will be 18 action figures in total (15 initial + 3 additional).
Response:  If Jerry has 7 additional action figures that he added to his initial collection of 3, then the total number of action figures he has now is 7 + 3 = 10. So, if he had 10 action figures on his shelf initially and he added 7 more, then the total number of action figures he has now is 10 + 7 = 17.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures in his room. Then he added 6 more to his collection, so now he has a total of 10 action figures (4 + 6 = 10). Therefore, there are 10 action figures in Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his room. If he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, then there are now 12 action figures (5 + 7 = 12) in total. However, if we subtract the number of books from the total number of action figures, we get 12 - 9 = 3 action figures that are still left on the bookshelf after adding the new ones. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books in his room. If he added 4 more action figures to the shelf, then the total number of action figures would be 6 (2 + 4). Now, let's count the number of books again. We know that Jerry had 10 books initially, so if he added 4 more action figures, there are now 14 books in total (10 + 4). Therefore, the correct answer is 14.
Response:  If Jerry had 8 action figures and added 10 more books to his collection, then the total number of items in his collection would be: 8 + 10 = 18. So, there are 18 books in Jerry's collection.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his room. So, the total number of items he had was 7 + 2 = 9. Then, when he added 4 more books to his collection, the new total number of items became 9 + 4 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 action figures in Jerry's bookshelf as compared to the number of books he has.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his room. So, the total number of items he had was 5 + 2 = 7. Then, he added 9 more books to his collection, so now he has 7 + 9 = 16 items in his room. Therefore, there are 16 books in Jerry's room compared to the 5 action figures he initially had.
Response:  If Jerry had 20 action figures in his room before adding 4 more and removing 5, then he has 29 action figures in total (20 + 4 - 5). So, the answer is 29.
Response:  If Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially and added 4 more later, then he has a total of 7 action figures now (3 + 4 = 7). So, if he took away some of them from the shelf, there will be fewer than 7 action figures left on the shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 6 or less.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 action figures initially and added some more to his collection, then he has a total of x action figures now. Since 10 action figures were removed from the initial collection, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 7 - 10.  Now, if Jerry adds n new action figures to his collection, we have another equation:  x + n = 8.  Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us the value of x (the number of action figures Jerry currently has) as 3. So, there are 3 action figures left on Jerry's shelf after he added or subtracted some.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures on his shelf. He added 2 more and took away 7 from the original ones. So, after this process, he has 5 - 7 = -2 action figures left on his shelf. Since he started with 5, there are now -2 action figures less than what he initially had, which means that Jerry has 3 action figures left on his shelf today (5 - (-2) = 3).
Response:  If Jerry has 9 action figures in his room and adds 7 more, then he now has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total.  Now, if we consider the number of books in Jerry's room, let's say there are x books. Since Jerry has 16 action figures and 10 books, the ratio of action figures to books can be represented as 16:10 or 2:1. Therefore, if Jerry has 10 books in his room, the number of action figures he has is twice that amount, which is 20 action figures (2 x 10).
Response:  Jerry has 3 books and 4 action figures in his room. When he added two more action figures to the shelf, there are now 6 action figures in total. So, the number of action figures Jerry has is 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  Jerry has 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. When he added more action figures, there are now 5 action figures in total. So, the number of books Jerry has is still 7 - 5 = 2. Therefore, the number of books in Jerry's collection is 2.
Response:  If there are currently two birds sitting on the branch and six more birds arrive to join them, then the total number of birds on the branch now is:  2 + 6 = 8. So, there are eight birds in total on the branch right now.
Response:  Initially, there are 4 ibons sitting on top of each other (bakod). If another 5 ibons join them later, how many ibons will be sitting on top of each other now? So, the total number of ibons sitting on top of each other is 9 (4 + 5 = 9).
Response:  We know that there are 4 ibons sitting on top of each other (46 + 4 = 50). Then, we have 6 additional ibons joining them. So, in total, there are 50 ibons including those who joined later.
Response:  There are three birds sitting on one branch (ibon), and two more birds perched on another branch nearby (storks). So, in total, there are five birds (3 + 2 = 5) sitting or perched near the branch. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  There are three storks and two birds that join them. If we assume that each bird joins one of the storks, then there will be a total of 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the back of the storks. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are two birds sitting on top of a tree branch and three birds joining them. So, in total, we have five birds (2 + 3 = 5). Therefore, there are more birds (5) than storks (3) sitting on the tree branch.
Response:  We know that there are already 5 ibons and 3 storks sitting on the branch. Then, two more storks arrive to join them. So, in total, how many storks are now sitting on the branch?  Therefore, the answer is 7 storks.
Response:  There are three ibons and four storks sitting on the branch of a tree. If we add four more storks to them, then there will be seven storks in total. So, the number of ibons and storks sitting on the branch is 3 + 7 = 10. Therefore, there are ten birds (three ibons and seven storks) sitting on the branch of the tree.
Response:  There are three birds already sitting on the branch (ibon). Then two more storks arrive to join them. So in total, there are five birds now sitting on the branch (ibon + storks). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 4 storks and 3 ibons sitting on the branch. If we add 5 more storks to them, then the total number of birds sitting on the branch will be:  4 + 5 = 9 storks. So, there are 9 storks plus the 3 ibons, which makes a total of 12 birds sitting on the branch. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  There are 4 birds sitting on top of the tree branch and 8 birds standing below it. So, in total, there are 12 birds (4 + 8). Since only one bird can sit on top of the branch, we subtract 1 from the total number to get the number of birds that can sit on the branch. Therefore, the answer is 11 birds can sit on the branch.
Response:  There are two birds sitting on top of the bread (ibon). If we add five more birds and four more storks to them, there will be a total of 9 birds and 8 storks. So, there are more birds than storks. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  There are three birds sitting on the branch of a tree - two eagles and one owl. Six more storks join them later. How many storks can sit on the same branch as these three birds combined?  Solution: To find out how many storks can sit on the same branch as the three birds, we need to add six (the number of storks that joined later) to the total number of birds already sitting on the branch. So, the answer is: Three + six = nine. Therefore, there can be up to nine storks sitting on the same branch as the three birds who were originally sitting there.
Response:  There are 3 storks sitting on top of a tree branch. 4 birds join them later. How many more birds can sit on the same branch as the storks than the original number of storks?  Therefore, there will be 7 birds (3 storks + 4 additional birds) who can sit on the same branch as the storks.
Response:  There are three storks and two ibons sitting on top of a tree branch. If we assume that each stork can accommodate one ibon, then there will be six birds in total (three storks x two ibons = six birds). So, there are more than six storks if you include the additional three ibons who joined them later. Therefore, the correct answer is seven storks.
Response:  There are three birds sitting on top of the tree branch (storks). Then, six more storks join them (making nine in total). Next, two additional ibons come and sit with them (making ten in total). So, there are ten birds in total - five storks and five ibons - sitting on the tree branch.
Response:  We know that the first part has 48 pages and the second part has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first part than in the second part, we can divide the number of pages in the first part by the number of pages in the second part. So, if we divide 48 by 11, we get 4.36 or approximately 4 pages more. Therefore, there are 4 more pages in the first part than in the second part.
Response:  We know that the first part has 37 pages and the second part has 80 pages. So, we can calculate the difference between them as follows: Page Difference = Number of pages in Second Part - Number of pages in First Part = 80 - 37 = 43 pages Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second part than in the first part.
"Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book with Chapter I having 60 pages and Chapter II having x pages. Since we want to find out how many pages are in Chapter II, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Number of pages in Chapter II = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in Chapter I
= 93 pages - 60 pages
= 33 pages
Therefore, there are 33 pages in Chapter II."
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book with Chapter I having 48 pages and Chapter II having 36 pages. To find out how many pages are in Chapter I, we can divide the total number of pages (67) by the number of chapters (2): 67 / 2 = 33.5 pages per chapter. Since Chapter II has 36 pages, it means that Chapter I has 33.5 + 36 = 69.5 pages. Therefore, there are 69.5 pages in Chapter I of the book.
Response:  The first part has 66 pages, and the second part has 35 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 = 101 pages. Finally, we add 24 pages to that total, which gives us the final answer: 101 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is 125 pages.
Response:  The first book has 91 pages, and the second book has 23 pages. So, if we divide the number of pages of the first book by two, we get 45.5 pages (91 / 2 = 45.5). Now, let's compare this to the number of pages of the third book. Since the third book has 25 pages more than the second book, we can say that the number of pages of the first book is greater than the number of pages of the third book by 25 pages minus 23 pages, which equals 22 pages (25 - 23 = 22). Therefore, the number of pages in the first book is 45.5 + 22 = 67.5 pages.
Response:  The first book has 35 pages in its second part, and the second book has 18 pages in its third part. So, if we subtract the number of pages of the second book from the total number of pages of the first book, we get: Total pages of the first book = 35 + 18 = 53 pages. Now, let's compare this with the number of pages of the third book: Number of pages of the third book = 3 pages. Therefore, there are 53 - 3 = 49 more pages in the first book than in the third book.
Response:  The first book has 53 pages, the second book has 75 pages, and the third book has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages the first book has than the third book, we can subtract their page counts: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. So, there are 32 more pages in the first book than in the third book.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Number of Pages per Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1831 pages So, the Kabuan (total) number of pages of the book is 1831 pages.
Response:  If there are 23 pages in total and the first part has 10 pages, then we can calculate the number of pages in the first part as follows: Number of pages in the first part = Total pages / Number of parts x Number of pages per part So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of pages in the first part = 23 / 2 x 10 = 46 pages Therefore, there are 46 pages in the first part of the book.
Response:  If there are 2 chapters in an Aklat and each chapter has 81 pages, then the total number of pages in one Aklat is:  Number of pages per chapter x Number of chapters = 81 pages/chapter x 2 chapters = 162 pages. Now, if the second chapter has 68 pages, we can find out how many pages are in the remaining part of the book (the first chapter) by subtracting the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the book:  Total number of pages - Number of pages in second chapter = 162 pages - 68 pages = 94 pages. So, there are 94 pages in the first chapter of the book.
"Response:  The number of campers who went to bed at dawn is given as 62.  The number of campers who went to bed in the afternoon is given as 39.  To find out how many more campers went to bed at dawn than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went to bed in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went to bed at dawn:  
So, there were 62 - 39 = 23 more campers who went to bed at dawn than in the afternoon."
Response:  The number of campers who went to bed at dawn is given as 52.  Therefore, the total number of campers = 52 + 61 = 113.  So, there are 113 campers who went to bed in the afternoon more than those who went to bed at dawn.
"Response:  If 15 campers woke up in the morning and 8 more woke up in the afternoon, then the total number of campers who woke up that day is:

15 + 8 = 23

So, there were 23 campers who woke up that day."
Response:  If 10 campers are sleeping during the day and 7 campers are sleeping in the afternoon, then there are a total of 17 campers who slept that day (10 + 7 = 17).  Since there were 60 campers in total, the proportion of campers who slept during the day is 17/60 or 1/4. Therefore, 25% of the campers slept during the day (1/4 x 100%).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 campers who went to sleep early (at dawn). Then, there are 13 campers who went to sleep late (in the afternoon). Finally, there are 49 campers who went to sleep late (at night). So, in total, there are 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers who went to sleep at different times.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 campers who went to sleep early in the morning and 39 campers who went to sleep late in the afternoon. Now, let's find out how many more campers went to sleep early than those who went to sleep late. We can do this by subtracting the number of campers who went to sleep late from the total number of campers who went to sleep early:  Number of campers who went to sleep early - Number of campers who went to sleep late = 44 - 39 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 more campers who went to sleep early than those who went to sleep late.
Response:  We know that there are 53 campers who went to sleep early (umaga), and 48 campers who went to sleep late (hapon). So, we have a total of 101 campers who went to sleep during the day or in the afternoon. Now, let's find out how many campers went to sleep at night (gabi). According to the question, there are 49 campers who went to sleep at night. Therefore, the number of campers who went to sleep during the day is greater than the number of campers who went to sleep at night. The difference between these two numbers is: 101 - 49 = 52. So, there are 52 more campers who went to sleep during the day than those who went to sleep at night.
"Response:  If there are 33 campers who went to bed early in the morning, and 34 campers who went to bed late in the afternoon, then we can assume that all of them went to bed at different times during the day. So, let's count how many campers went to bed in each time slot:

* Morning (6 AM - 12 PM): 33 campers
* Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM): 34 campers
* Evening (6 PM - 10 PM): 10 campers

So, the number of campers who went to bed in the afternoon is greater than the number of campers who went to bed in the evening. Therefore, the answer is A) More than half."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 13 campers who went to bed early and 59 campers who woke up late.  Secondly, we know that 21 campers woke up in the afternoon. So, how many campers woke up early? To find out, we need to subtract the number of campers who woke up late from the total number of campers who woke up. Therefore, the number of campers who woke up early is:  Total number of campers who woke up - Number of campers who woke up late = 108 - 59 = 49 campers.  Finally, we want to know the number of campers who woke up early among all the campers. To do this, we divide the number of campers who woke up early by the total number of campers. Therefore, the number of campers who woke up early among all the campers is:  Number of campers who woke up early / Total number of campers = 49/167 = 0.29 or approximately 29%.
"Response:  We know that there are 29 campers who went to bed early and 66 campers who woke up late.  From this information, we can determine how many campers woke up earlier than 12 pm as follows:

Total number of campers = 29 + 66 = 95

Number of campers who woke up earlier than 12 pm = Total number of campers - Number of campers who woke up at noon
= 95 - 26
= 70

Therefore, among those who went to bed early, 70 campers woke up earlier than 12 pm compared to those who woke up late."
Response:  We know that there are 4 campers who went for a walk in the morning and 4 more who went for a hike during the day. Therefore, the total number of campers who went for a walk or a hike is 8 (4 + 4). Now, we are told that 26 campers stayed overnight. So, among those who stayed overnight, there were 26 - 8 = 18 campers who did not go for a walk or a hike. Thus, the number of campers who went for rowing is 18.
Response:  There are 46 campers in total. 43 of them went to bed during the daytime and some of them went to bed during the afternoon. How many campers went to bed during the afternoon? So, the number of campers who went to bed during the afternoon is 43 - 17 = 26. Therefore, there were 26 campers who went to bed during the afternoon.
Response:  If Pinili has 4 mangos and he gave 1 to Rachel, then he has 3 left.  Now, if his tree had 7 mangoes at first, that means he has 7 - 3 = 4 mangoes remaining in the tree. So there are 4 more mangoes in the tree than what Pinili has.
Response:  We know that initially, there were 4 mangoes in Rachel's tree and she chose some of them. Now, there are only 2 mangoes left in the tree. So, we can say that Rachel took away x mangoes from the tree, where x is the difference between the initial number of mangoes (4) and the current number of mangoes (2). Therefore, the answer is 4 - 2 = 2 mangoes.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 ripe mangoes in the tree and now there are only 5 left after 3 of them have been picked. If we assume that the remaining unpicked mangoes are equally distributed among the remaining branches, then the number of unpicked mangoes per branch is 5/3 = 1 6/3 = 2. So, the total number of unpicked mangoes is 2 x 3 = 6. Therefore, the number of unpicked mangoes that remain in the tree today is 6.
Response:  We know that there were initially two fruits (mansanas) in Rachel's tree and now there are 7 fruits remaining. Of these 7 fruits, 6 have enough fruit to start growing again, while 1 does not yet have enough fruit. So, we need 6 more fruits with enough fruit to grow for the tree to begin producing fruit again.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 ripe mangoes in the tree and now there are only 2 left. So, we need to find out how many mangoes were removed from the tree. Since 4 of the remaining mangoes are not yet ripe, we can deduct 4 from the total number of mangoes needed for the tree to start bearing fruit again. Therefore, the number of mangoes needed for the tree to start bearing fruit again is:  Number of mangoes needed = Total initial mangoes - Remaining ripe mangoes = 6 - 2 = 4.
Response:  According to the problem, there were initially 3 ripe mangoes in Rachel's tree and now there are 2 ripe mangoes and 27 unripe mangoes. To start growing the tree again, we need X number of ripe mangoes. Since there were originally 3 ripe mangoes, we can deduce that X = 3. So, we need 3 ripe mangoes to start growing the tree again.
Response:  According to the problem, Pinili initially had 7 mangoes from his tree. After that, 2 new mangoes grew on the tree. Now, the tree has 6 mangoes remaining. To start the simulation, how many mangoes does the farmer need to plant? Solution: The number of mangoes needed to plant is equal to the initial number of mangoes minus the number of new mangoes that grew. In this case, it is 7 - 2 = 5 mangoes. So, the farmer needs to plant 5 mangoes to start the simulation.
Response:  The original number of mangoes in Rachel's tree is 2. When she chooses 4 more from her tree, there are now 6 mangoes (2 + 4 = 6). After that, 3 new mangoes grow on the tree, so the total number of mangoes in the tree now is 9 (6 + 3 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 mangoes in Rachel's tree now.
Response:  If Rachel has 52 mangos and takes 2 from one of her trees, then she will have 52 - 2 = 50 mangos left in that tree. Now, if there are still 7 mangos remaining in that tree after Rachel took 2, then there were initially 7 + 2 = 9 mangos in that tree to start with. So, to find out how many mangos are needed to start with, we can divide the total number of mangos available (initially) by the number of mangos taken by Rachel:  Number of mangos needed to start with = Total number of mangos available / Number of mangos taken by Rachel = 9 / 2 = 4.5 mangos. Since you cannot take a fraction of a mango, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 mangos. Therefore, Rachel needs 5 mangos to start with.
Response:  If Rachel has 3 bunches of mangoes and she chooses 8 mangoes from each bunch, then she will choose a total of 3 x 8 = 24 mangoes. Now, there are 9 mangoes in each bunch remaining, so the total number of mangoes left after she chooses her share is 9 x 3 = 27 mangoes. Therefore, the total number of mangoes in all the bunches at first was 24 + 27 = 51 mangoes.
Response:  If there are initially 4 fruits in each bunch and Rachel chooses 7 fruits from each bunch, then she will choose a total of 7 x 4 = 28 fruits from all the bunches. However, since there are now 29 fruits in each bunch after Rachel has chosen her fruits, the remaining fruits in all the bunches would be 29 - 28 = 1 fruit. So, Rachel chose 1 mango.
Response:  At first, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had 2 + 1 = 3 more marbles than Doug initially. After the game, Ed now has 19 marbles and Doug lost some of his marbles. To find out how many marbles Doug lost, we can subtract the number of marbles he had after the game from the number of marbles he had initially. Therefore, the answer is 16 (19 - 3).
Response:  If Ed has 45 marbles and he has more than Doug who has 10 marbles, then we can say that Ed has x marbles more than Doug. Since Doug had 11 marbles less than Ed, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 45 - 11 = 34 Therefore, Ed has 34 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  If Ed has 6 more marbles than Doug, then Doug has 6 - 6 = 0 marbles. Since Doug lost 7 marbles from his original collection of 22 marbles, he now has 22 - 7 = 15 marbles left. So, the number of marbles that Doug has today is 15.
Response:  At first, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles initially. Then, one of Doug's marbles disappeared from the playground. Now, Doug has 3 - 1 = 2 marbles left. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles that Ed and Doug have is now: 8 - 2 = 6 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has more than 24 marbles because he got 9 additional ones. So, Ed has at least 33 marbles (24 + 9 = 33). On the other hand, Doug had 27 marbles initially and lost some of them while playing in the playground. Therefore, Doug has fewer marbles now than he did before, let's say he has 18 marbles left (27 - 9 = 18). Now, to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the total number of marbles Ed has: 33 - 18 = 15. So, Ed has 15 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 29 marbles initially and lost 17 of them in the playground, then he has 29 - 17 = 12 marbles left. Now, let's compare how many more marbles Ed got than Doug. Since Ed has 12 marbles left while Doug only has 8 marbles, we can say that Ed got 12 - 8 = 4 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  At first, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had 19 + 8 = 27 marbles. Now, we are told that Ed lost some of his marbles during the game. Therefore, the number of marbles Ed has now is 27 - x, where x is the number of marbles Ed lost. Since Ed has 8 fewer marbles than Doug now, we can set up the equation: 27 - x = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 20. So, Ed lost 20 marbles during the game.
Response:  If Ed has 30 more marbles than Doug, then Ed has 91 - 30 = 61 marbles. So, Ed has more marbles than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug and lost 5 of them, then he has 12 - 5 = 7 marbles left.  Since Doug now has 17 marbles, the difference between their number of marbles is: 17 - 7 = 10 marbles. Therefore, Doug has 10 more marbles than Ed.
Response:  If 408 students are adding mashed potatoes to their orders and only 42 students are adding bacon, then we can calculate the ratio of students who added mashed potatoes to those who added bacon as follows:  Ratio = Number of students adding mashed potatoes / Total number of students = 408 / 460 = 0.91 or approximately 91%. So, approximately 91% of the students added mashed potatoes to their orders while only 9% (or 42/460 x 100%) added bacon.
Response:  If 479 students added mashed potatoes to their orders while 489 students added bacon, then we can calculate the number of students who added both mashed potatoes and bacon as follows:  Number of students who added both = Total number of students x Percentage of students who added both (%)  In this case, the total number of students is 479 + 489 = 968. Now, let's find out what percentage of students added both mashed potatoes and bacon:  Percentage of students who added both = (Number of students who added both / Total number of students) x 100  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Percentage of students who added both = (968 / 968) x 100 = 100%  Therefore, 100% of the students who added either mashed potatoes or bacon also added both.
Response:  If there are 310 students in total and 185 of them want to add mashed potatoes to their meals, then we can say that 185/310 = 0.59 (or approximately 60%) of the students want to add mashed potatoes.  As for the bacon suggestion, if 185 students suggested adding bacon, then we can say that 185/310 = 0.57 (or approximately 57%) of the students suggest adding bacon.
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students added bacon to their orders while 24 students added mashed potatoes. So, the number of students who added mashed potatoes is 24.
Response:  We know that out of 457 students, 63 students added mashed potatoes to their orders while 294 students did not add any additional dish. So, the number of students who added bacon is 457 - 63 = 404. Therefore, there are 404 students who added bacon to their orders.
Response:  We know that there are 182 students who added mashed potatoes to their orders and 166 students who added bacon. So, in total, there are 182 + 166 = 348 students who made an additional order. Since we want to find out how many of them added bacon, we can divide the number of students who made an additional order by 2 (since they could have either added bacon or mashed potatoes). Therefore, the number of students who added bacon is 348 / 2 = 174 students.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there were 324 students who added mashed potatoes to their orders. Then, we are told that 374 students added bacon to their orders. Finally, we are informed that 128 students added tomatoes to their orders. To find out how many students contributed to each new dish, we can divide the number of students who added each ingredient by the total number of students who participated in the food survey. Using this method, we get:  Number of students adding mashed potatoes = 324 / 608 = 0.53 or approximately 53% Number of students adding bacon = 374 / 608 = 0.61 or approximately 61% Number of students adding tomatoes = 128 / 608 = 0.21 or approximately 21% Therefore, about 53% of the students added mashed potatoes, 61% added bacon, and 21% added tomatoes.
Response:  If 257 students are asked to add an ingredient to the menu and 120 of them choose to add mashed potatoes, then there are 137 students who do not choose to add mashed potatoes (257 - 120 = 137).  If 97 students are also asked to add an ingredient and 97 of them choose to add bacon, then there are 40 students who do not choose to add bacon (97 - 40 = 57).  Therefore, there are more students who added mashed potatoes than those who added bacon (137 > 57).
Response:  If 144 students are adding mashed potatoes to their meals and 467 students are adding bacon, then together they added 611 (144 + 467) students adding meat to their meals. However, if only 79 students are adding vegetables among the remaining 253 students who did not add any meat, then the total number of students adding vegetables is 79. Therefore, there are more students adding meat than adding vegetables.
Response:  If 228 students are adding mashed potatoes to their meals and 337 students are adding bacon, then there are a total of 565 students (228 + 337) who are adding either mashed potatoes or bacon to their meals. However, among those who added bacon, only 23 students added mangoes, so the number of students who added bacon is greater than the number of students who added mangoes by 314 students (337 - 23). Therefore, the ratio of students who added bacon to students who added mangoes is 314:565 or 1:1.8.
Response:  If there are 450 students who will add mashed potatoes to their meals and 38 students who will add bacon, then we can calculate the total number of students who will add new dishes as follows:  Total number of students = Number of students adding mashed potatoes + Number of students adding bacon - Number of students already participating in adding other dishes (126)  Therefore, the number of students who will add new dishes is:  Total number of students = 450 + 38 - 126 = 292 students.
Response:  If 218 students are adding mashed potatoes and bacon to their meals, then the total number of students who added bacon is 351 - 218 = 133. Therefore, 133 students added bacon to their meals.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are adding bacon to their orders. According to the question, 269 students are adding bacon to their orders. Next, we need to find out how many students are adding mashed potatoes to their orders. The question states that 330 students are adding mashed potatoes to their orders. Finally, we need to find out how many more students are adding mashed potatoes than bacon. To do this, we can subtract the number of students who added bacon from the total number of students who added mashed potatoes: 330 - 269 = 61. Therefore, there are 61 more students who added mashed potatoes than bacon.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male and female students are in the school. According to the question, there are 569 male and 236 female students in the school. So, if we divide the number of female students (236) by the total number of students (705), we get the ratio of females to males as follows:  Female/Male Ratio = 236/705 = 1/3 or 1/4. Therefore, there are approximately one-third or one-fourth more female than male students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students there are in the school. According to the question, there are 841 male students in the school. Now, let's find out how many female students there are in the school. According to the question, there are 34 female students in the school. So, the ratio of male students to female students in the school is 841 : 34 = 24 : 1. Therefore, for every one female student in the school, there are 24 male students.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 485. Among them are 232 female students and 263 male students. Therefore, there are 263 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 697 female students and 228 more male students than females. So, the total number of male students = 228 + 697 = 925. Therefore, there are 925 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 635 students in total, and 510 of them are males. So, the number of male students in the school is 510.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 868 male students in the school. Now, let's find out how many more female students than male students there are. We know that there are 281 more female students than male students. So, if there are x male students, then there are x + 281 female students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:  x + (x + 281) = 868  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 281 = 868  Subtracting 281 from both sides gives us: 2x = 687  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 343.5  Since you cannot have a fraction of a student, we will round off the answer to the nearest whole number, which is 344 male students and 281 female students.  Therefore, there are approximately 344 male students and 281 female students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 700 male students in the school. Now, let's calculate the number of female students based on the ratio given in the question. The ratio states that for every 142 male students, there are x female students. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: Number of Female Students = 142 x Number of Male Students / Total Number of Students In the school So, if there are 700 male students, and we want to know the number of female students, we can plug this value into the equation above: Number of Female Students = 142 x 700 /  total number of students in the school To solve for the unknown variable (total number of students), we can simplify the equation: Number of Female Students = 142 x 700 / 142 + 700 = 142 + 700 = 842 Therefore, there are approximately 842 female students in the school.
Response:  We are given that there are 706 students in total, of which 418 are female and 222 are male. So, the number of male students = 222. Now, we need to find out how many students are present in the school today. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of students present = Total number of students - Number of absent students. In this case, let's assume that 50 students are absent from school today. Therefore, the number of students present in the school today = 706 - 50 = 656. So, there are 656 students present in the school today.
Response:  We are given that there are 902 students in total, of which 44 are female. So, the number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students. = 902 - 44 = 858 males. Therefore, there are 858 male students in the school today.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 410 male students in the school. Now, let's find out how many female students are in the school. We know that there are 632 total students in the school, and 465 of them are female. So, the ratio of female students to male students in the school is 632/410 = 1.52. Therefore, there are approximately 1.52 times more female students than male students in the school.
Response:  We are given that there are 732 male students in the school and 761 female students in the school.  If 682 of them are enrolled in the school now, then we can find out how many females are left using the following equation: Number of Females = Total number of Female Students - Number of Females Enrolled Now Number of Females = 761 - 682 = 79 Therefore, there are 79 females in the school right now.
Response:  We know that there are 135 female students in the school and 214 male students in the school. So, altogether, we have 496 students (135 females + 214 males). Now, let's find out how many male students are currently enrolled in the school. To do this, we need to subtract the number of female students from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of male students currently enrolled in the school is:  Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students  Number of male students = 496 - 135  Number of male students = 361  Therefore, there are 361 male students currently enrolled in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 318 male students in the school. Now, let's find out how many female students are in the school. According to the question, there are 308 female students in the school. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is equal to the sum of the number of male and female students, which is: 318 + 308 = 626. So, there are 626 students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 309 male students in the school. Now, let's find out how many female students are in the school. According to the question, there are 315 female students in the school. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is equal to the sum of the number of male and female students, which is: 309 + 315 = 624 students. So, there are 624 students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are more than 400 female students in the school (402 to be exact).  If there were exactly 739 male students in the school, then the ratio of females to males would be 402/739 = 1/1.85. So for every one male student, there are approximately 1.85 female students.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male students are in the school. According to the question, there are 458 more female than male students in the school. So, if there are x male students, then there are 458 - x female students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school (including both males and females) is 692. Now, let's find out how many male students there are in the school. Since there are 458 more female than male students, the number of male students must be less than 458. So, we can set up an equation as follows: x + 458 = 692 where x is the number of male students. Solving for x, we get x = 234. Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many male and female students are in the school. According to the question, there are 362 males and 257 females in the school. Next, we need to find out how many female students joined the school. According to the question, 403 female students joined the school. Therefore, the ratio of female students to male students in the school is: Female students : Male students = 403 : 362 = 1.13:1.
Response:  If Edward has $ 18 and he spends $ 16, then his remaining money is:  $ 18 - $ 16 = $ 2. So, Edward has $ 2 left today.
Response:  If Edward had $ 13 initially and now he has $ 3 left, then we can calculate his expenses as follows:  Expenses = Initial amount - Remaining amount = $ 13 - $ 3 = $ 10 So, Edward spent $ 10.
Response:  According to the problem, Edwar...
Response:  According to the problem, Edwar...
Response:  We know that Ed has $ 6 to spend and he wants to buy two books worth of equal value. So, if each book costs $ x, then we can write an equation as follows:  $ 6 = 2x  Now, we are given that the cost of one book is twice the amount of money Ed has ($ 12). Therefore, we can substitute this value in the previous equation:  $ 6 = 2(twice $ 12)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  $ 6 = 48  Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x (the cost of one book):  $ 3 = x  Therefore, each book costs $ 3.
Response:  According to the problem, Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens before he had $19 left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $6 + $16 = $19  Now let's solve for the missing value using subtraction:  $6 + $16 = $19  Subtracting $6 from both sides gives us:  $10 = $13  Dividing both sides by $10 gives us:  $1 = $13 / $10  Therefore, Edward had $13 before he spent money on books and pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 12 now. So he spent some amount to buy books and pens worth $ 4 each. Therefore, the total amount he spent for buying books is $ 4 x number of books = $ 4 x 5 = $ 20. Similarly, the total amount he spent for buying pens is $ 3 x number of pens = $ 3 x 3 = $ 9. So, in total, Edward spent $ 20 + $ 9 = $ 29 on buying books and pens.
Response:  If Edward spent $ 16 on books and $ 8 on pens, then he has $ 16 + $ 8 = $ 24 left after buying both. Now, if he spends $ 19 on books, that means he has $ 24 - $ 19 = $ 5 left after buying books. So, the amount Edward spent on books is $ 5.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward received $ 17 from his friend and then he lost $ 3 (since he now has $ 7). So, initially, Edward had $ 17 - $ 3 = $ 14. Now, we are asked how much money does Edward have before he lost $ 3. Therefore, the answer is $ 14.
Response:  If Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did more than 58 push-ups, then we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44. So, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and David is equal to the number of push-ups done by David minus the number of push-ups done by Zachary, which is:  x - 44 = 58 - 44 = 14. Therefore, the number of push-ups done by Zachary is 44, and the number of push-ups done by David is 14 more than 44, or 58.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. So we can say that Zachary did more push-ups than David. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract the number of push-ups done by David from the number of push-ups done by Zachary. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and David is 51 - 44 = 7. So Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  If David did 44 push-ups in his class today and he did more than Zachary (who did 9), then we can say that Zachary did 35 push-ups or less (since 44 - 9 = 35). So, the answer is 35.
Response:  If David did 51 push-ups in his class today and he did more than Zachary who did 49 push-ups, then we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than or equal to 49. So, the answer is 51 - 49 = 2.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. David did more than Zachary in terms of push-ups (19) but fewer crunches (27). So, we can say that David did 19 - 59 = -40 push-ups less than Zachary. Since crunches are not subtracted, David did 44 crunches as well. Therefore, David did 19 + 44 = 63 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches.  David did more than Zachary in terms of push-ups (29), but fewer in terms of crunches (13). So, we can say that David did x number of crunches where x is the difference between his total number of push-ups and Zachary's total number of push-ups minus the number of crunches he did. In this case, x = 26 (29 - 13). Therefore, David did 26 crunches.
Response:  According to the problem, Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. If we subtract the number of push-ups that David did (17) from the total number of push-ups done by Zachary, we get 36. Similarly, if we subtract the number of crunches that David did (10) from the total number of crunches done by Zachary, we also get 4. So, the answer is 36 for push-ups and 4 for crunches.
"Response:  According to the problem, Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. David did more than Zachary in both categories. So if David did x push-ups and y crunches, then Zachary did less than x push-ups and y crunches. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 35 = 58 (push-ups)
y + 3 = 87 (crunches)
Solving for x and y gives us:

x = 62
y = 49
So Zachary did 62 push-ups and 49 crunches."
Response:  According to the problem, Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. David did 38 push-ups but more than 62 crunches compared to Zachary. So we can say that Zachary did x crunches more than David. Since David did 62 crunches, Zachary did (x + 62) crunches. Now we know that Zachary did 110 crunches more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 19 push-ups, and David did more than Zachary but fewer than John. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is between 19 and 13 (the number of push-ups done by John). Therefore, David did 22 push-ups.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in class today. Then, we are told that David did more than Zachary but fewer than 22 more push-ups. So, David did 22 - 51 = 29 push-ups. Next, we learn that John did fewer push-ups than David, specifically 4 less push-ups. Therefore, John did 29 - 4 = 25 push-ups. Hence, John did 25 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did more than 39 push-ups. So, we can say that Zachary did x push-ups where x is less than or equal to 39. Now, we also know that John did fewer push-ups than David, so John did y push-ups where y is greater than x but less than or equal to 40 (since John did 9 push-ups). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 15 = x + y - 9  Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this one gives us: 24 = y - 9  Solving for y, we get: y = 26  So, Zachary did 15 push-ups, and John did 26 push-ups.
"Response:  If David did 30 more than Zachary in one class at the gym today, that means Zachary did x push-ups. Since David did 37 push-ups, we can set up an equation as follows:  x + 30 = 37  Now let's solve for ""x,"" which represents the number of push-ups Zachary did. To do this, subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:  x = 37 - 30  x = 7  Therefore, Zachary did 7 push-ups in addition to whatever David did."
Response:  If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in class today, that means Zachary did 38 push-ups (since 56 - 38 = 18). So, David and Zachary together did 38 + 38 = 76 push-ups.
Response:  If David did 40 push-ups and 17 fewer than Zachary, then Zachary did 40 + 17 = 57 push-ups. Since David also did 62 crunches, that means Zachary did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches. So, David did 45 crunches less than Zachary.
Response:  If David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer crunches than Zachary, then we can say that David did x push-ups and y crunches. Since David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, David did 36 + x push-ups in total. Similarly, since David did 33 fewer crunches than Zachary, David did 33 - y crunches in total. Now, let's compare the number of push-ups and crunches done by both David and Zachary: Push-ups: David = 36 + x Crunches: David = 33 - y Zachary = 58 + y Now, we need to find out how many more push-ups David did compared to Zachary. We can do this by subtracting Zachary's total number of push-ups from David's total number of push-ups: Number of push-ups done by David minus number of push-ups done by Zachary = 36 + x - (58 + y) = x + y - 22 This equation shows us that if David did x push-ups and y crunches, he did 22 more push-ups than Zachary.
Response:  If David did 27 push-ups and 7 fewer crunches than Zachary in class today, that means Zachary did 34 crunches (27 - 7 = 34). So if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 more crunches than he did push-ups, then he did 22 crunches more than he did push-ups (5 + 17 = 22). Therefore, Zachary did 56 crunches (34 + 22 = 56) more than he did push-ups.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework, then she has completed a total of 7 pages (5 + 2 = 7) of homework so far. Therefore, she still has x - 7 pages left to complete, where x is the total number of pages in her homework assignment. So, the answer is x = 13 (since there are 13 pages in an A4-size paper).
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 3 pages of math worksheets and 4 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, then she has a total of 7 pages of homework (3 + 4 = 7).
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 5 pages of math worksheets and more than 5 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, then she needs to complete a total of 10 pages (5 + x) where x is the number of additional pages needed to make up for the missed work. Since it takes her longer to finish reading comprehension worksheets than math worksheets, we can assume that x is greater than 5. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete a total of 12 pages (10 + 2) to catch up with her missing work.
Response:  According to the problem, Rachel needs to complete 7 pages of math worksheets and she has already completed 4 pages. So, there are remaining 3 pages that need to be completed.
"Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of math homework and she has to choose between completing 3 more pages of math problems with many more subtopics than reading comprehension, then we can calculate the number of pages needed for each topic as follows:

For math problems, let's assume there are x subtopics that need to be covered in 3 additional pages. Since there are 8 pages in total, this means that each page will have approximately x/8 subtopics.

On the other hand, if Rachel chooses to read comprehension, she needs to cover 3 pages worth of material, which means she will have to read approximately 3x subtopics per page.

Now, based on these calculations, we can see that if Rachel chooses to do math problems instead of reading comprehension, she will have to cover approximately x/8 subtopics per page, while if she chooses to do reading comprehension, she will have to cover approximately 3x subtopics per page.

Therefore, the answer is that Rachel should choose to do math problems so that she can cover more subtopics per page compared to reading comprehension."

Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 10 pages of math homework and she has already completed 3 pages with more reading comprehension questions than math problems, then we can calculate how many pages she still needs to complete based on the ratio of reading comprehension questions to math problems.  So if there are 3 pages with more reading comprehension questions than math problems, that means there are 7 pages (10 - 3 = 7) remaining for her to complete. Since each page has approximately 4-5 math problems, Rachel will need to complete around 28-35 math problems (7 x 4 = 28 or 7 x 5 = 35). Therefore, Rachel needs to complete around 28-35 math problems in addition to the 3 pages she has already completed.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 2 pages of math homework and 3 pages of reading comprehension, she will need to complete 5 pages in total (2 + 3 = 5). Additionally, if she needs to complete 10 pages of science homework, that brings the total number of pages needed to be completed to 15 pages (5 + 10 = 15). Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 15 pages in total.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 9 pages of math worksheets and she has already completed 2 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, then she still needs to complete 7 more pages of math worksheets. Since there are 96 pages of science worksheets, Rachel would need to complete 13 more pages of math worksheets than science worksheets (96 - 2 = 94). Therefore, the number of pages of math worksheets that Rachel needs to complete is 13.
"Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 11 pages of math homework and she has already completed 2 pages of reading comprehension and 3 pages of science, then we can calculate how many pages she still needs to do in math as follows:

Pages needed for math homework = Total number of pages - Number of pages done in reading comprehension - Number of pages done in science
= 11 - 2 - 3
= 6

So, Rachel still needs to complete 6 pages of math homework."
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 7 pages of math worksheets and each page has 11 problems, then she needs to solve 7 x 11 = 77 problems in math.  If she also needs to read 8 pages of science worksheets, then she needs to read 8 x 5 = 40 sentences or phrases in reading comprehension. Therefore, Rachel needs to spend more time reading than solving math problems.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 9 pages of math worksheets and 11 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, then she has a total of 20 pages (9 + 11) to finish in her homework. Since there are 29 pages of science worksheets for her to complete, that means she has 9 pages left over after finishing her math and reading assignments. So, the number of pages of math and reading worksheets that Rachel can complete at home is 9.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of math worksheets and she has already completed 7 pages of reading comprehension worksheets, then she still needs to complete 1 page of math worksheets.  Moreover, if there are 3 pages of science worksheets left for her to finish, then she needs to complete 5 pages more (8 - 3 = 5) of other subjects' worksheets. Therefore, the total number of pages that Rachel needs to complete is 5 + 1 = 6 pages.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 5 pages of math worksheets in 10 minutes and she has already completed 2 pages, then she has 3 pages left to finish.  Since each page has 4 problems, Rachel needs to solve 3 x 4 = 12 problems in total within the remaining time.  Therefore, Rachel needs to solve 12 problems per minute to finish all her tasks on time.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math worksheets, then she has completed half of her total workload for both subjects combined.  Therefore, if we assume that each page of reading comprehension is equivalent to 1/2 page of math worksheet (since they are both worth equal points), then Rachel has completed 3 pages of math worksheets out of a possible 8 pages.  So, the answer is 3/2 = 1.5 pages.
Response:  If Rachel needs to complete 4 pages of chores in the house for reading and 7 pages of chores in the house for mathematics, then she has completed 4 + 7 = 11 pages of chores in total so far. Now, if she has 19 pages of chores left in her homework for biology, that means she still has 19 - 11 = 8 more pages of chores to complete in her homework for biology than she has already completed for reading and mathematics combined.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, in total, he received 6 + 2 = 8 emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, in total, he received 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, let's assume that he received x emails in the morning and y emails in the afternoon. We know that the total number of emails Jack received was 5, so we can write an equation:
x + y = 5... (1)
We also know that x is equal to 4, since Jack received 4 emails in the morning. Therefore, we can substitute this value into equation (1):
y = 5 - 4... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for y using substitution or elimination method?"
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and he replied to all of them, then he must have received a total of 6 x 1 = 6 emails that day.  Similarly, if he received 3 emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails that day. Finally, if he received 5 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 9 + 5 = 14 emails that day. So, Jack received a total of 14 emails that day.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 13 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon). Now, we are asked how many emails Jack received during the evening (6 PM - 10 PM). From the information given, Jack received 72 emails during the evening. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received during the daytime is 13, and the number of emails he received during the evening is 72.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails he received is 4 + 8 = 12. Therefore, Jack received 12 emails in one day.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 7 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon).  If he also received 8 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 15 emails throughout the day (daytime + evening). So, the answer is 15.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 7 emails in the afternoon, and 17 emails in the evening. So, we can calculate the total number of emails that Jack received as follows: Total number of emails = Morning + Afternoon + Evening Total number of emails = 10 + 7 + 17 = 34 Therefore, Jack received more emails in the evening than he did in the morning or the afternoon.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening for a total of 16 emails. So, the number of emails that Jack received during the day is greater than the number he received in the evening. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) More than 7.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So far, he has received a total of 15 emails. However, the question also states that Jack received 4 emails in the evening, which is more than the number of emails he received in the afternoon (5). Therefore, we can conclude that Jack received more emails in the evening than in the afternoon. In particular, Jack received 9 additional emails in the evening compared to the afternoon.
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and he replied to all of them, then he did not receive any more emails until after lunchtime (assuming that he took a break during lunch). So, let's say he received 2 emails in the afternoon. Then, if he received another 4 emails in the evening, that means he received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 8 emails per day.
Response:  At 7 am, Jack received 3 emails and at 12 noon, he received another 5 emails for a total of 8 emails. So, in one day, Jack received 8 emails.
Response:  At 6 am, Jack received 5 emails. Then he received another 9 emails at 12 noon and 7 more emails in the afternoon for a total of 16 emails. So, Jack received a total of 16 emails that day.
Response:  At 8 am, Jack received 10 emails. Then he received another 3 emails at noon. So, in total, Jack received 10 + 3 = 13 emails before 4 pm. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received between 8 am and 4 pm is 13.
Response:  At 8 am, Jack received 6 emails and at 10 am, he received another 2 emails, so in total, he received 8 emails at 8 am. In the afternoon, he received 7 more emails, bringing the total number of emails he received to 15 (8 + 7). Therefore, the answer is 15.
"Response: 
Jack received 6 emails in the morning and replied with 91 emails in the afternoon. So, he sent out 91 - 6 = 85 emails in total that day.  Therefore, Jack received 85 / 2 = 42.5 emails per day on average."
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 replies. In the afternoon, he received 6 more emails and sent 8 replies. So in total, Jack sent 10 emails that day (4 + 2 = 10).
Response:  If Jack received 9 emails in one day and he received 7 emails before noon, then he received a total of 16 emails that day (9 + 7 = 16).
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 16 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 20 emails that day. So, the number of emails Jack received in the morning is 20 - 3 = 17.
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and many more in the evening, that means he received a total of 10 emails that day. So, the answer is 10.
Response:  The radius of the ball (balang) is 9 cm and that of the plate (palaka) is 12 cm. To find out how much longer the plate is than the ball, we need to calculate their circumferences using the formula C = πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. For the ball, the radius is 9/2 = 4.5 cm, so its circumference is C_ball = π(4.5) = 14.6 cm. For the plate, the radius is 12/2 = 6 cm, so its circumference is C_plate = π(6) = 30.8 cm. Now, let's compare their circumferences: C_plate - C_ball = 30.8 - 14.6 = 16.2 cm. Therefore, the plate is 16.2 cm longer in circumference than the ball.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out the height of both objects in meters. We know that 1 foot = 0.3048 meter, so:

Balang - height = 31 pulgadas x (1/0.3048) = 102.67 meters
Palaka - height = 35 pulgadas x (1/0.3048) = 114.95 meters
Now, let's calculate their difference in height in meters:
Difference in height = Palaka - Balang = 114.95 - 102.67 = 12.28 meters
Therefore, the height difference between the two objects is approximately 12.28 meters."
Response:  The distance between the salamin and the daga is 36 inches, while the distance between the daga and the uod is 17 inches more than the distance between the salamin and the daga. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Distance between salamin and uod = 36 + (17 x number of inches between salamin and daga)  Substituting the given values in the equation above, we get:  Distance between salamin and uod = 36 + (17 x 15) = 36 + 255 = 291 inches  So, the distance between the salamin and the uod is 291 inches.
Response:  The distance between the salamin and the daga is 25 inches, and the uod is 18 inches farther away from the salamin than the daga. So, if we draw an imaginary line connecting the salamin to the daga, then another line connecting the daga to the uod, we can see that the distance between the uod and the mouse (which is located at the end of the second line) is 2 inches longer than the distance between the uod and the daga. Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the salamin is 27 inches (or 69 cm).
"Response:  The distance from the point where the angle subtended by the palm and the distance between the two lines are equal to 19 inches (as given in the problem).  So if we draw a line connecting the points where the palm touches the ground, it will be 19 inches long.  Now, let's find out how far apart the two lines are.  If the distance between them is x inches, then the length of the line segment joining the two points where they intersect is also x inches.  Since the angle subtended by the palm and the distance between the two lines are equal, the ratio of the length of the line segment to the distance between the two lines is also equal to the ratio of the height of the daga to the height of the balang.  Therefore, we can write:
x = (height of daga) / (distance between lines)
Now, we know that the height of the daga is 20 inches more than the height of the balang, so we can substitute this value in the equation above:
x = (20) / (distance between lines)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 30 inches
Therefore, the distance between the two lines is 30 inches more than the distance between the point where the palm touches the ground and the point where the daga intersects with the ground."
Response:  The distance between the center of the sun and the center of the Earth is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers (km). So if we assume that the radius of the Sun is equal to half its diameter, then the radius of the Sun would be approximately 19 times larger than the radius of the Earth. Therefore, the radius of the Sun is roughly 19 x 6,378 km = 125,000 km. Now, let's calculate the distance from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth along a line perpendicular to the surface of the Sun. This distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as follows: Distance = sqrt((125,000 km)^2 + (39 pulgada)^2) = 39 pulgada + sqrt(125,000 km^2 + (39 pulgada)^2) = 39 pulgada + 149,500 km = 188,500 km. Finally, since the Earth is assumed to be a sphere with a radius of 6,378 km, the volume of the Earth can be calculated as V = (4/3) \* pi \* r^3 where r is the radius of the Earth. Substituting the value of r = 6,378 km into this formula gives us V = (4/3) \* pi \* (6,378 km)^3 = 1.08321 x 10^12 km^3. Similarly, the volume of the Sun can be calculated as VSun = (4/3) \* pi \* R^3 where R is the radius of the Sun. Substituting the value of R = 125,000 km into this formula gives us VSun = (4/3) \* pi \* (125,000 km)^3 = 3.332 x 10^13 km^3. To find out how far apart these two objects are in terms of their volumes, we need to divide the volume of one object by the volume of the other. In this case, dividing the volume of the Earth by the volume
Response:  The distance between the salamin and the daga is 25 inches, while the distance between the daga and the uod is 32 inches. Since the uod is farther away from the salamin than the daga, we can conclude that the distance between the uod and the salamin is greater than the distance between the daga and the salamin. Therefore, the distance between the uod and the salamin is 32 - 25 = 7 inches. Similarly, since the daga is closer to the salamin than the uod, the distance between the daga and the salamin is 26 - 25 = 1 inch. So, the distance between the mouse and the salamin is 7 inches.
Response:  The distance between the two points (uod and daga) is 33 - 24 = 9 pulgadas or approximately 10 inches. Since we know that the height of the daga is 5 inches less than the height of the uod, we can calculate it as follows: Distance from Daga to Salamin = Height of Uod - Height of Daga = 10 inches - 5 inches = 5 inches. Therefore, the distance between the daga and the salamin is 5 inches.
"Response:  The distance between the center of the balang and the center of the palaka is 13 inches. Since the balang is closer to the center than the palaka, we can say that the distance from the center of the balang to the center of the palaka is greater than the distance from the center of the palaka to the center of the balang. So, if x represents the distance from the center of the balang to the center of the palaka, then we can write:
x > 2 inches (since the balang is 2 inches closer to the center than the palaka)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 13 - 2 = 11 inches
So, the distance from the center of the balang to the center of the palaka is 11 inches."
Response:  The height of Ang Balang (AB) is 35 pulgadas and the distance between AB and Ang Palaka (AP) is 4 pulgadas more than the height of AB. So, we can say that AP = AB + 4. Now, we need to find out how many meters are equal to 1 pulgada. According to the Philippine Standard Unit of Measurement, 1 pulgada = 0.254 meters. Therefore, AP = AB + 4 = 35 x 0.254 = 8.76 meters.
"Response:  We know that the distance between the balang and the palaka is 19 inches, while the distance between the balang and the daga is 4 inches more than the distance between the balang and the palaka. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Distance between Balang and Daga = Distance between Balang and Palaka + 4 inches

Now, we are given that the distance between the balang and the daga is 44 inches. Substituting this value into our equation, we get:

Distance between Balang and Daga = Distance between Balang and Palaka + 4 inches = 19 inches + 4 inches = 23 inches

Therefore, the distance between the palaka and the daga is 23 inches."
Response:  The distance between the balang and the palaka is 39 inches, while the distance between the balang and the daga is 19 inches. Since the balang is closer to the palaka than the daga, we can say that the distance between the balang and the mouse (daga) is 12 inches less than the distance between the balang and the palaka. Therefore, the distance between the balang and the mouse is 39 - 12 = 27 inches.
Response:  The distance between Balang and Palaka is 21 inches, while the distance between Daga and Palaka is 16 inches. To find out how far Balang is from Daga, we need to subtract the distance between Balang and Palaka from the distance between Daga and Palaka. So, the difference in distance = Distance between Balang and Daga - (Distance between Balang and Palaka + Distance between Daga and Palaka) = 21 - (25 + 16) = 21 - 41 = -20 inches. Therefore, Balang is 20 inches closer to Daga than Palaka.
Response:  The volume of the cylinder (balang) is given as 39 cubic decimeters and that of the sphere (palaka) is given as 17 cubic decimeters. To find out how much larger the volume of the sphere is than that of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere. Since the radii of the two objects are not given directly, we need to convert their dimensions into equivalent units first. Let's assume that both objects have the same unit of measurement, such as cubic centimeters (cm³). Then, we can calculate the ratio of their volumes using the above formula: Vballang / Vpalaka = (4/3)π(17 cm³) / (4/3)π(39 cm³) = 2.65 So, the volume of the sphere (palaka) is approximately 2.65 times larger than that of the cylinder (balang).
Response:  We know that the distance between the pointer and the screen is 9 inches. The mouse moves 3 inches less than the pointer, so the distance between the mouse and the screen is 6 inches (9 - 3 = 6). Therefore, the mouse moves 6 inches away from the screen.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the diameter of the palaka (the big circle) is 37 pulgadas and it is farther away from us than the diameter of the daga (the small circle). So, if we draw an imaginary line passing through both circles, we can find out how far apart they are. This distance will be called ""d"".  Now, let's measure the radius of each circle using their diameters:  Radius of Palaka = Diameter / 2 = 37 / 2 = 18.5 pulgadas  Radius of Daga = Diameter / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 pulgadas  Since the radii of the two circles are different, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between them: Distance = sqrt((Radius of Palaka - Radius of Daga)^2 + (Radius of Daga - Radius of Palaka)^2) = sqrt(8^2 + 18.5^2) = 9.06 pulgadas  Therefore, the distance between the center of the daga and the center of the palaka is approximately 9.06 pulgadas."
Response:  We know that Mary added 5 cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe requires 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. So, we need to subtract the amount of flour that Mary added from the total amount required by the recipe.  Therefore, the number of cups of flour needed today is: 14 - 5 = 9 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar needed for the recipe. Since we added only 4 cups of flour, we need to subtract 5 cups (9 - 4 = 5) more cups of flour than what was originally called for in the recipe. Therefore, the number of cups of sugar required today is 6 cups (11 - 5 = 6).
Response:  If Mary needs 8 more tases of flour to complete her recipe and she has already used 6 tases of flour, then she needs a total of 8 + 6 = 14 tases of flour in all. Since the recipe calls for 13 tases of sugar, Mary will have enough sugar even if she uses 14 tases of flour. So, the answer is 14 tases of flour.
Response:  If Mary needs to make 11 cups of cake and she has already mixed 7 cups of flour, then she still needs 4 more cups of flour (11 - 7 = 4). However, if she only has 2 additional cups of flour left after mixing all the ingredients, then she will not be able to make the full amount of cake that she needs (4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2 cups of flour remaining.
Response:  We know that the original recipe requires 11 cups of flour and 3 cups of flour have already been added to make the cake. To determine how many more cups of flour are needed, we can divide the total amount required (11 cups) by the amount already used (3 cups). So, the remaining number of cups of flour needed is: 11 / 3 = 3 + 1 = 4 cups. Therefore, the recipe needs an additional 4 cups of flour.
Response:  If Mary has already mixed 12 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar, then she has a total of 17 cups (12 + 5) of ingredients. To find out how many cups of flour she needs to add more, we can divide the remaining amount needed by the number of cups she wants to make (in this case, 2). So, if she needs 2 cups of flour more, she will mix 19 cups (17 - 2) of ingredients.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar in the original recipe. If we add 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar, then we have a total of 10 cups of flour and 67 cups of sugar. So, to find out how many more cups of flour are needed, we subtract the amount already added from the total amount required: 10 - 6 = 4 cups of flour remaining to be added.
Response:  We know that Mary added 10 tasa of flour and 2 tasa of sugar to the recipe. The original recipe called for 5 tasa of flour and 14 tasa of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more tasa of sugar Mary needs to add to make up for the difference. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar in the original recipe (14 tasa) by the amount of sugar that Mary added (2 tasa). This gives us an estimate of how many additional tasa of sugar Mary needs to add: 14 - 2 = 12 tasa. Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more tasa of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary added 11 cups of flour to make the cake. The recipe calls for a total of 12 cups of flour. So, we need to subtract 11 from 12 to find out how many cups of flour are left. Therefore, the answer is 1 (one) cup of flour is needed to be added.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of flour to the mixture, and we want to find out how many more cups she needs to add compared to the original amount of flour in the recipe. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour, so if Mary has already added 7 cups, then she still needs to add 3 more cups (10 - 7 = 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of flour to the mixture. So, the total amount of flour left is 10 tablespoons (12 - 2 = 10). Now, we need to find out how many tablespoons of flour are required to be added today compared to the amount of vinegar and salt. We can do this by dividing the total amount of flour needed by the number of days since Mary last added flour. Based on the information given in the question, it takes 3 days for each table spoon of flour to be used up. Therefore, if today is day 5 after Mary last added flour, she needs to add 3 x 5 = 15 tablespoons of flour. So, the answer is 15 tablespoons.
Response:  We know that there are 6 cups of flour in the original recipe and we added 5 cups of flour to it. So, the total number of cups of flour used is 6 + 5 = 11 cups. Now, let's calculate how many cups of sugar are needed based on the ratio given in the problem. The ratio is 8 cups of sugar for every 11 cups of flour. Therefore, the number of cups of sugar needed is 8 x 11 = 88 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary added 2 tablespoons of asukal to the recipe which originally called for 13 tablespoons. So, we need to add an additional 11 tablespoons (13 - 2 = 11) of asukal to the recipe.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar in the original recipe. Since we added 4 cups of sugar, we need to subtract 4 cups of flour from the total amount of flour needed. So, the number of cups of flour needed today is: 9 - 4 = 5 cups.
Response:  If we subtract the amount of flour that Mary already has (2 tasa) from the total amount needed for the recipe (9 tasa), we get 7 tasa remaining to be added. Now, if we divide this number by the number of portions in the recipe (6), we get the amount of flour required per portion, which is 1 and 1/3 tasa. So, Mary needs an additional 1 and 1/3 tasa of flour today instead of the 6 tasa of asukal.
Response:  We know that there are 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar needed to make the cake. Since we added only 11 cups of flour, we need to subtract 4 cups of flour from the total amount needed (5 - 4 = 1). So, we need an additional 3 cups of flour today compared to the amount of flour originally called for in the recipe.
Response:  If Mary added 3 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar to make the cake, then she has used a total of 3 + 10 = 13 cups of ingredients so far. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we can subtract the number of cups she has already used from the total amount needed (5 cups). So, Mary needs 5 - 13 = -8 cups of flour. Since this is a negative quantity, it means that Mary does not need any more flour to make the cake.
Response:  If Mary has already mixed 5 cups of flour and needs an additional 12 cups for the recipe, then she will need to mix 7 more cups (12 - 5 = 7) of flour. So, the total amount of flour that Mary will mix is 5 + 7 = 12 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 6 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar needed for the recipe. Since we added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar, we need to subtract these amounts from the total amount required. So, the remaining amount of harina needed is: 6 - 7 = 9 cups.
Response:  We know that we need 12 tasa of flour and 10 tasa of sugar to make the cake according to the original recipe. So, if we add more sugar than what is required in the recipe, we will have excess sugar. Therefore, we need to subtract 10 tasa from the total amount of sugar needed to get the correct amount. Hence, the number of additional tasa of sugar needed is 10 - 10 = 0 tasa.
Response:  We know that the total amount of flour needed is 3 times 10 + 15 = 45 tasa. Since we added only 6 tasa of flour, we need to add an additional 45 - 6 = 39 tasa of flour. So, the answer is 39 tasa.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups of flour in total and we added 4 cups of flour to it. So, the remaining amount of flour needed is equal to 9 - 4 = 5 cups.
Response:  According to the recipe, they needed 7 tasa of flour and 4 tasa of salt. Since she already added 2 tasa of flour, they now need 5 more tasa of flour (7 - 2 = 5). So, they need 5 more tasa of flour than the amount of salt required.
Response:  We know that the original recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of sugar. Since we added an extra cup of flour, we need to add another cup of sugar now. So, the total amount of sugar needed is 10 cups (9 + 1). Therefore, the number of additional cups of sugar required is 3 (10 - 7 = 3).
Response:  We know that Mary needs 7 cups of all-purpose flour and 10 cups of sugar for her recipe. She has already added 4 cups of all-purpose flour. So, we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount needed (7 + 10 = 17) by the amount she has added so far (4). This means that Mary needs an additional 3 cups of all-purpose flour (17 - 4 = 13).
Response:  We know that there are 12 tablespoons of sugar and 14 tablespoons of flour in the recipe. Since we added 10 tablespoons of sugar, we need to subtract 10 tablespoons from the total amount of sugar needed. So, the number of tablespoons of flour needed today is: 14 - 10 = 4 tablespoons.
Response:  The number of birds that migrate to warmer areas is given as 19. If there are 60 families of birds that migrate for warmth, how many more families migrate than those living near the mountain?  Therefore, the answer is 41 (60 - 19).
Response:  The number of families of birds that migrate to warmer areas is 87.  If 7 families of birds migrate for warmth, how many more families of birds are there than those who migrate for warmth?  Therefore, the answer is 87 - 7 = 80.
Response:  The number of families of birds that migrated to warmer areas is 20. However, there are still 14 families of birds living near the mountain. So, the number of families of birds living in the area before the migration is 14.
Response:  The total number of families of birds that migrate to warmer countries is 85. Of these, 23 families move towards Aprika and 37 families move towards Asia. So, the number of families of birds left behind in the mountain is:  Number of families of birds left behind = Total number of families of birds - Number of families that moved towards Aprika - Number of families that moved towards Asia  Number of families of birds left behind = 85 - 23 - 37 = 25 families of birds left behind in the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are more birds moving to warmer countries than those moving to colder countries. So, we can assume that most of the bird families moved to Asia (A) rather than Africa (Aprika). Now, let's calculate the number of bird families that moved to each region based on the given information:  Number of bird families that moved to Asia = 42 + 31 = 73  Number of bird families that moved to Africa =?  Since there are fewer bird families moving to Africa compared to Asia, we can assume that the number is smaller. Let's say it's x. Then, we have: Total number of bird families that moved = 73 + x  Therefore, the answer is: X = 73 - 42 = 31
Response:  We know that there are more birds moving towards hotter countries than cooler ones. So, we can assume that most of the bird families (47) moved towards Asia compared to those who moved towards Africa (94). Therefore, the ratio of bird families moving towards Asia is greater than the ratio of bird families moving towards Africa.
Response:  The passage states that most birds migrate to warmer countries during halos (hot weather). Of the 18 bird families living near the mountain, 38 families moved towards Aprika and 80 families moved towards Asia. So, we need to find out how many bird families migrated to these places in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of bird families moving towards each place by their respective numbers. For example, if 38 bird families moved towards Aprika, then the total number of bird families that migrated to Aprika is 38 x 18 = 672. Similarly, if 80 bird families moved towards Asia, then the total number of bird families that migrated to Asia is 80 x 18 = 1440. Therefore, the total number of bird families that migrated to both Aprika and Asia is 672 + 1440 = 2112.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 87 families of birds live near a mountain. If 18 new families of birds join them, how many families of birds will be living near the mountain now? Therefore, the answer is 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds living near the mountain.
Response:  The number of families of birds that migrate to warmer areas is 49. Of these, 59 families moved for warmth and 24 new families arrived from the Arctic to settle near the mountain. Therefore, there are 59 - 24 = 35 families of birds left behind in the mountains.
Response:  We know that most birds migrate to warmer areas during hot weather.  If 27 families of sparrows moved from near a mountain to a place with better weather, and there are 41 families of sparrows living nearby the mountain initially, then we can conclude that 14 additional families of sparrows have moved to the area near the mountain since the heat wave began.
Response:  The number of families of birds that migrate to warmer areas is given as 86. If there are 45 families of birds living near a mountain, how many more families of birds migrate to warmer areas than those living near the mountain?
Response:  The total number of families of birds that migrate to hot countries is 41. Of these, 35 families migrate to Asia and 62 families migrate to Africa. So, there are more families of birds that migrate to Africa than those that migrate to Asia.
Response:  The first family of birds moved to the mountain because it was too hot in their previous habitat. There were 3 families of birds living near the mountain. Two families of birds migrated from the Arctic to live near the mountain, and two families of birds flew south to escape the heat. How many families of birds are left near the mountain?  We know that there were initially 3 families of birds living near the mountain, and 2 families migrated to the north or south. So, the number of families of birds left near the mountain is: 3 - 2 = 1. Therefore, one family of birds is left near the mountain.
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 crayons as a gift for his birthday and he gave away 70 of them at the end of the school year. So, the number of crayons left with him is 253 - 70 = 183 crayons.
Response:  We know that Paul received 551 crayons from his friends and gave away 177 of them. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows:  Number of crayons given away = 177  Now, let's solve for the number of crayons he received:  Number of crayons received = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons given away  Substituting the values we know into the equation above, we get:  Number of crayons received = 551 - 177  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of crayons received = 374  Therefore, Paul received 374 crayons during his birthday celebration.
Response:  We know that Paul has 440 crayons in total and he gave away 111 of them to his friends while 106 were missing. So, we can calculate the number of crayons left with him as follows: Number of crayons left with Paul = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons given away = 440 - 111 = 329 crayons Therefore, 329 crayons remained with Paul after giving some away to his friends.
Response:  If Paul has 65 crayons and gives away 16 of them to his friends while he was in school, then he has 49 crayons left (65 - 16 = 49). So, the number of missing or given away crayons is 16.
Response:  According to the problem, Paul gave away 571 crayons to his friends during school while 161 were missing. So, the total number of crayons he had was 571 + 161 = 732. Now, we need to find out how many crayons Paul gave away more than the ones that were missing. To do this, we subtract the number of missing crayons (161) from the total number of crayons given away (732): 732 - 161 = 571. Therefore, Paul gave away 571 crayons more than the ones that were missing.
Response:  If Paul has 110 crayons and gives away 90 to his friends while 412 are missing, then we can calculate how many crayons he gave away as follows:  Number of crayons given away = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons left with him = 110 - 412 = 70 So, Paul gave away 70 crayons to his friends. Now, let's find out how many crayons were missing compared to those he gave away: Missing crayons = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons given away = 412 - 70 = 342 Therefore, 342 crayons were missing compared to the ones Paul gave away.
Response:  We know that Paul has 332 crayons left after his birthday party and he gave away 563 crayons to his friends during the party. So, if we subtract the number of crayons given away (563) from the total number of crayons left (332), we get: 332 - 563 = -231 Therefore, Paul did not receive any crayons during his birthday party.
Response:  If Paul has 52 crayons and gives them to his friends while he was away for 52 weeks, then he gave out 1 crayon per week.  Since there are 52 weeks in a year, that means he gave out a total of 52 x 1 = 52 crayons.  Now, if he had 492 crayons in total before he went away, and he gave out 52 crayons during his absence, then he still has 492 - 52 = 440 crayons left.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 colored pencils and 66 erasers as gifts for his birthday. After he finished his school year, there were only 154 colored pencils left with him while one eraser was missing. So, we can conclude that 367 colored pencils (521 - 154 = 367) were given to him during the school year, and 305 colored pencils (66 + 305 = 367) were not given to him. Therefore, 305 colored pencils were missing or given away during the school year.
Response:  We know that there are 531 crayons and 38 erasers in total. If we subtract the number of erasers from the total number of items, we get: 531 - 38 = 493. So, there are 493 more crayons than erasers.
Response:  We know that there are 601 colored pencils and 406 erasers in total. After one year of studying, only 336 colored pencils were left while 270 erasers remained (since some erasers were lost). So, if we subtract the number of remaining erasers from the total number of both, we get: Number of colored pencils left = Total number of colored pencils - Number of erasers remaining = 601 - 270 = 331 Now, let's compare the number of remaining colored pencils to the number of missing erasers: Number of missing erasers = Total number of erasers - Number of erasers remaining = 406 - 270 = 136 Therefore, there are 136 more erasers than colored pencils left.
Response:  We know that Paul got back 291 crayons from his trip and there were initially 315 crayons in total. So, we can calculate the number of crayons he took as follows: Number of crayons taken = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons returned Total number of crayons = 315 Initially, there were 315 crayons. Since Paul got back 291 crayons, the number of crayons he took is: Number of crayons taken = 315 - 291 = 24 Therefore, Paul took 24 crayons during his trip.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 308 crayons to his friends and he had 267 crayons left after giving them away. So, we can calculate how many crayons he gave away by subtracting the number of crayons he had left from the total number of crayons he gave away:  308 - 267 = 41 Therefore, Paul gave away 41 more crayons than he had initially.
Response:  We know that there are 457 erasers and 320 crayons given to Paul for his birthday. After studying for one year, only 523 erasers were left with him while 197 crayons remained. So, we can say that the number of crayons remaining with him is greater than the number of erasers remaining with him. Therefore, the ratio of crayons to erasers remaining with him is 320:457 or 3:2.
Response:  The waiter had 11 customers initially and after he left, there were still 3 customers remaining. So, in total, there were 11 + 3 = 14 customers at the restaurant.
Response:  The waiter had 3 customers initially and then lost 2 of them. So he has 3 - 2 = 1 remaining customer left behind. Therefore, there are 1 more customer left than those who have left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers and the waiter had them all. After they left, he still has 12 customers. So, if we subtract the number of customers who left (9) from the total number of customers he currently has (12), we get the original number of customers he had at the start: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, the waiter originally had 3 customers.
Response:  If there is one waiter and he has 14 customers, then each customer is being served by that one waiter. So, if we divide 14 by 1 (the number of waiters), we get the total number of customers that can be served by that one waiter, which is 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  If there was one client (A) and he had 13 clients in total (including himself), then the number of customers he served would be 13 + 1 = 14. Now, if 4 new customers arrived after he finished serving the previous ones, then the total number of customers he served would be 14 + 4 = 18. So, there are 18 customers now.
Response:  If there was one customer initially and he had 12 customers while 15 customers left, then the total number of customers he had at some point in time would be: Customers = Initial customers + New customers - Old customers  Customers = 1 + 12 - 15 Customers = 6 So, there were 6 customers who had the waiter at some point in time.
Response:  The first client arrived at 10 am and there was only one waiter (A). So, the waiting time for the first client was 0 hours or 10 minutes. Then, another client arrived at 10:20 am, so the waiting time for this client was 20 minutes. Next, two more clients arrived at 10:40 am and 11:00 am, respectively, so their combined waiting time was 60 minutes. Finally, eight new customers arrived between 11:20 am and 12 noon, which means that the total waiting time during this period was 240 minutes (or 4 hours). Therefore, the number of new customers who arrived during this time frame is 8.
"Response:  The first customer arrived at 10 am and left at 12 pm, leaving 4 customers behind. Then another customer came in at 12:30 pm, followed by 3 more customers at 1:00 pm, 2 customers at 1:30 pm, and 5 customers at 2:00 pm. So, there were a total of 8 customers during the time period (10 am - 2 pm). Now, let's count how many new customers arrived after 2 pm:  At 2:30 pm, 1 new customer arrived; at 3:00 pm, 2 new customers arrived; at 3:30 pm, 3 new customers arrived; at 4:00 pm, 4 new customers arrived; and finally, at 4:30 pm, 1 new customer arrived. Therefore, the total number of customers who arrived after 2 pm was 99."
Response:  The waiter had 12 customers at first and lost some of them after he left. We don't know how many customers he lost, but let's assume it was 6 (just an estimate). So, he had 12 - 6 = 6 customers remaining when he came back. Then, he gained 10 new customers, so he has 6 + 10 = 16 customers now. Therefore, the number of customers the waiter has now is 16.
Response:  If Dan spent P3 for one candy bar and he bought two candies bars, then he spent a total of P6 (P3 x 2). So, his change would be P6 - P2 = P4.
Response:  If Si Dan has $ 4 and he bought a chocolate bar worth $ 3 after that, then we can calculate the cost of the chocolate bar as follows:  Cost of chocolate bar = Total amount of money available to buy the chocolate bar - Amount spent buying the chocolate bar = $ 4 - $ 3 = $ 1 So, the value of the chocolate bar is $ 1.
"Response:  If Dan buys 99 chocolate bars at $3 each, he will spend a total of:
$3 x 99 = $297
So, the amount of money that Dan has left after buying the chocolate bars is:
$4 - $297 = $293"
"Response:  If Dan buys 2 candy bars for $ 4 each and he has $ 3 initially, then his remaining balance after buying the candy bars will be:
$ 3 - (2 x $ 4) = $ 3 - $ 8 = $ -5
So, the cost of one chocolate bar is $ 8 / 2 = $ 4."
Response:  If Si Dan has $ 2 to spend and he buys x chocolate bars that cost $ 3 each, then we can write an equation as follows:  $ 2 = 3x  Now, if we divide both sides of the equation by 3, we get:  $ 1 = x So, Si Dan bought x = 1 chocolate bar.
Response:  If he bought one chocolate bar for $ 2 and another one for $ 3, then his total cost would be:  Total Cost = Price of first chocolate bar + Price of second chocolate bar  Total Cost = $ 2 + $ 3  Total Cost = $ 5 So, the amount left after buying the two chocolates is: Amount Left = Initial Money - Total Cost  Amount Left = $ 7 - $ 5  Amount Left = $ 2 Therefore, the amount left after buying the two chocolates is $ 2.
Response:  If he bought one chocolate bar for $ 7 and another for $ 6, then his total cost would be:  Total Cost = $ 7 + $ 6 = $ 13. So, he spent $ 13 to buy both chocolate bars.
Response:  If he spent $ 2 for one chocolate bar and $ 3 for another chocolate bar, then he spent a total of $ 5 ($ 2 + $ 3). Since he also bought a candy bar worth $ 6, his total spending would be $ 11 ($ 5 + $ 6). So, the difference between what he spent on buying the candy bar and what he spent on buying the two chocolate bars is $ 6 ($ 11 - $ 5).
Response:  If he bought one chocolate for $ 3 and another for $ 2, then his total cost would be:  Total Cost = $ 3 + $ 2 = $ 5. So, he spent exactly the same amount of money to buy both chocolates as he did to buy the chocolate bar. Therefore, the difference in price between buying a chocolate and a chocolate bar is zero or $ 0.
Response:  If Dan spent $ 4 for the chocolate bar and he got $ 5 from his friend after buying it, then we can calculate how much money Dan had before buying the chocolate bar as follows:  Money that Dan had before buying the chocolate bar = $ 4 + $ 5 = $ 9. So, Dan had $ 9 before buying the chocolate bar.
"Response:  If Dan spent P3 for one candy bar and he paid P4 for the chocolate, then we can find out how much the chocolate costs per piece as follows:

Cost of chocolate = Total amount spent / Number of pieces
= P4 / Number of pieces

Since Dan bought one piece of chocolate, the cost per piece is:

Cost per piece = Cost of chocolate / Number of pieces
= P4 / 1
= P4

Therefore, the halaga ng tsokolate (cost of chocolate) is P4 per piece."
Response:  If Si Dan has $ 4 and he buys 10 chocolate bars with each one costing $ 3, then he will spend a total of $ 3 x 10 = $ 30. So, after buying the chocolate bars, he will have $ 4 - $ 30 = $ 16 left. Therefore, the amount of money that Si Dan has left is $ 16.
Response:  If Si Dan has $ 3 and he buys two chocolate bars with equal prices of money, then we can write an equation as follows:  So, if each chocolate bar costs $ x, then the total cost of both chocolate bars will be twice that amount:  Now, we are given that Si Dan has $ 3, so we can set up another equation to represent this constraint:  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  Therefore, the price of each chocolate bar is $ 1.50.
Response:  If he spent $ 5 for chocolate and $ 3 for candy bar, then his total expense would be $ 8 ( $ 5 + $ 3). Now, if we compare this amount with what he saved buying the chocolate ($ 7 - $ 8 = $ 1), it means that he saved $ 1 by buying the chocolate instead of the candy bar. So, the answer to the question is $ 1.
Response:  If he spent $ 4 for something else and then bought chocolate worth $ 7, his total spending would be $ 4 + $ 7 = $ 11. Similarly, if he spent $ 2 for another item and then bought a candy bar worth $ 7, his total spending would be $ 2 + $ 7 = $ 9. So, the amount he spent on buying chocolate was greater than the amount he spent on buying a candy bar. Therefore, the answer is (A) $ 11 - $ 9 = $ 2.
Response:  If Paul has 115 books and he sells 78 of them at a garage sale, then we can say that 37 books are left with him (115 - 78 = 37).
Response:  At first, he sold 137 books for $105 at a garage sale. So initially, he had 137 - 105 = 32 books left with him.
Response:  If Paul has 108 books and he sells some of them in a garage sale, then he will have fewer books left. Let's say he sold x books. Since he gave away 35 books to his friend, he now has x - 35 books left. Then, if he bought y books from the garage sale, he will have (x - 35) + y books left. So, the number of books that Paul bought from the garage sale is y. Therefore, the answer is y = 62.
Response:  If Paul has 50 books and he bought 151 at the garage sale, then we can say that the number of books he bought = Number of books he already had - Number of books he already had.  In this case, if Paul has 50 books, then the number of books he bought = 151 - 50 = 101 books. So, Paul bought 101 books from the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul has two sets of books and he sold some at a garage sale, then he must have bought new ones with the remaining amount. So, let's find out how much he spent on buying new books. According to the problem, he spent $150 on buying new books. Now, we need to calculate how many books he can buy with that amount. We know that each book costs $2.67 (since there are 58 books in total), so: Number of books = Amount spent / Cost per book = $150 / $2.67 = 58 books Therefore, Paul bought 58 new books with the money he earned from selling his old books.
Response:  If Paul has 21 books and sells some of them at a garage sale to buy 42 new ones, then he must have had $X amount left after buying the new ones. Since he bought 42 new books, we can say that his total number of books now is $X + 42$. We are asked how much more than $X$ the total number of books is now. So, we can set up an equation as follows: $X + 42 = X + Y$, where $Y$ is the original number of books Paul had ($= 21$). Solving for $Y$, we get $Y = 19$. Therefore, the difference between the number of books Paul had originally and the number of books he has now is $19$.
Response:  If Paul has 71 books and sold some of them at a garage sale to buy 38 new ones, then he must have had fewer than 71 books left after selling some. So let's call the number of books he had left x. Since he bought 38 new books, we can say that his total number of books now is x + 38. Now, according to the problem, he has 116 books in total today, so we can set up the equation: x + 38 = 116. Solving for x, we get: x = 78. Therefore, Paul bought 40 more books than he had before (38 - 40 = -2).
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens initially. After selling some of his items in a garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, we can calculate how many books Paul bought during the garage sale as follows: Number of books bought = Total number of books available for purchase - Initial number of books owned = 66 (books left after sale) - 108 (initial number of books) = 42 Books were bought by Paul during the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 51 books and sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling some books, he has 82 books left. He also bought 14 new books during the garage sale. So, the number of books that Paul bought is equal to the difference between his original number of books (51) and the total number of books he has after selling some (82). Therefore, the answer is:  Number of books bought = 51 - 82 = -31 books.
Response:  If Paul sold 27 books at a garage sale and he had 136 books in total before selling any, then we can calculate his remaining number of books as follows:  Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books sold = 136 - 27 = 109 books So, there are 109 books left after Paul sold 27 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 134 books initially and gave away 39 of them to his friend. So, he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sold some of these books in a garage sale and earned 68 pesos. Therefore, the number of books that he bought in the garage sale is equal to the amount of money he earned from selling them minus the number of books he already had before the garage sale. In this case, it would be: 68 - 95 = -27. So, Paul did not buy any books in the garage sale because he actually lost money (-27) instead of gaining it.
Response:  Paul has 95 books and sells some of them in a garage sale. After the sale, he has 13 books left. Then, he buys 23 books from the same garage sale. So, the number of books that Paul bought from the garage sale is 23 - 13 = 10.
Response:  Paul bought some books and other items from a garage sale and sold them for $113. After selling these items, he had $19 left over. So, how many books did he buy at the garage sale? We can use the information given in the problem to find out. According to the problem, Paul had 42 pens and 143 books before buying anything else. If he bought something else, then he must have sold something to get $19. Since he had 113 books after selling something, that means he must have bought 100 books (113 - 42 = 67) at the garage sale. Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  If there were initially 8 roses in the vase and Jessica added another 5 roses, then the total number of roses in the vase now is 8 + 5 = 13 roses.
Response:  Initially, there were 16 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica added another 23 roses to the vase today. So, the total number of roses in the vase now is:  16 + 23 = 39 roses.
"Response:  According to the question, there were initially two roses in the vase (Jessica put four roses from her garden into the vase). Then, she added new roses from her flower pot to the vase, making the total number of roses 23 today. So, the number of roses that Jessica put into the vase is:  
$ Number = $ 2 + $ 4 = $ 6 $  Therefore, the correct answer is $ 6."
Response:  If there were initially 33 roses in the vase and Jessica added 10 new roses to it, then the total number of roses in the vase now is 43 (33 + 10). Now, if she took out 17 roses from the vase, then the remaining number of roses in the vase would be 26 (43 - 17). So, the answer is 26.
Response:  According to the problem, Jessica has already put 34 roses into the vase and there are 15 more roses today. So, the total number of roses that Jessica has is 34 + 15 = 49 roses. Therefore, the number of roses that she still needs to buy is 49 - 34 = 15 roses.
Response:  According to the problem, Jessica has 59 roses in her garden and she gives 20 of them away today. So, the number of roses that Jessica has left is 59 - 20 = 39 roses.
Response:  On May 13, Jessica had 12 roses in her vase. Then, she received 5 more roses on that day. So, the total number of roses she had on May 13 was 12 + 5 = 17 roses. Now, let's move to May 21. If she received 3 more roses on that day, then the total number of roses she has now is 17 + 3 = 20 roses. Therefore, there are 20 roses in Jessica's vase as of today (May 21).
Response:  On May 15, there were 62 orchids and 0 roses in Jessica's vase. Then, she added more roses (not specified how many) to the vase. Later, on May 17, there were 96 orchids and 17 roses in the vase. So, the number of roses that Jessica added is 17 - 0 = 17.
Response:  We know that there are 10 roses and 21 orchids in total.  If we divide the number of roses (10) by the number of orchids (21), we get 0.4761904761904762. So, approximately 48 orchids were picked by Jessica from her garden.
Response:  On May 5th, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica added more roses (12) and orchids (2) to the vase today, so the total number of roses is now 17 (5 + 12). The total number of orchids is still 3. Therefore, as of today, there are 17 roses and 3 orchids in the vase.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase as of today (May 7).  Then, according to the statement ""Jessica arranged more roses and orchids from her garden,"" we can assume that she added more roses and orchids to the vase after May 7. So, let's add the total number of roses and orchids added to the vase since May 7:  Total number of roses added = 11 + x (where x is the number of roses added since May 7) Total number of orchids added = 20 + y (where y is the number of orchids added since May 7) Now, based on the question, we know that there are currently 31 roses and 40 orchids in the vase as of today (May 11). Therefore, we can calculate the difference between the current number of roses and orchids and the initial number of roses and orchids as follows: Difference in roses = 31 - 11 = 20 Difference in orchids = 40 - 20 = 20 Based on this calculation, there are currently 20 more orchids than roses in the vase as of today (May 11)."
Response:  If there are currently 19 roses in the vase and Jessica adds 3 more roses today, then the total number of roses she has added is 3 + 19 = 22 roses. So, the number of roses that Jessica has put into her vase so far is 22 roses.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 84 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. If we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers, we get:  Number of orchids = 84 - 14 = 70. So, Jessica put 70 orchids in the vase.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase as of today (May 7). Then, according to the statement ""Jessica arranged many orchids and roses from her garden,"" it can be inferred that she added more orchids and roses to the vase after May 7. Therefore, the number of orchids and roses in the vase as of May 16 is greater than 7 and 13, respectively. However, we cannot determine exactly how much greater without additional information."
Response:  On May 6th, there were 20 roses and 5 orchids in the vase.  Since Jessica arranged some of the roses and orchids from her garden, let's assume she added 3 more roses and 2 more orchids to the vase. So, as of May 21st, there are 21 roses and 7 orchids in the vase. Finally, on May 22nd, there are 22 roses and 9 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the total number of roses plus orchids in the vase today is 22 + 9 = 31.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are currently 3 roses and 13 orchids in the vase as of today. If we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers, we get:  Number of orchids = 13 - 3 = 10. So, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase as of today.
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 13 inches long and he measured it earlier when it was 17 inches long, then we can calculate how much shorter his hair has become as follows:  Distance = Old length - New length = 17 inches - 13 inches = 4 inches So, Robin's hair has shrunk by 4 inches since he last measured it.
Response:  If Robin cut his hair 5 years ago and it was 20 cm long before he cut it, then it is now 10 cm long because of how much time has passed since he cut it. So, if he cut his hair 5 years ago, and today it is 10 cm long, that means that his hair grew for 5 years or 5 x 12 = 60 months. Therefore, if we divide 60 months by 30 days per month, we get approximately 2 years.
Response:  At first, Robin had 16 inches of hair. He cut off 11 inches and after that his hair grew by 12 inches. So now, Robin has 39 inches of hair (16 + 12 - 11).
Response:  If Robin's hair is currently 19 inches long and it grows at a rate of 1 inch per month, then after 18 months, his hair will be 18 inches long. So, the correct answer is 18 inches.
Response:  If Robin has 13 cm of hair now and it was previously 14 cm long, then the difference in length is equal to the current length minus the previous length. So, the answer is:  $ \text {Difference} = \text{Current Length} - \text{Previous Length} $ $\text{= }$ $ \text{13 cm} - \text{14 cm} $ $\text{= }-$ $ \text{1 cm} $. Therefore, the answer is -1 cm.
Response:  At first, Robin had 14 inches of hair which grew to be 8 inches longer. After that, he cut his hair to 20 inches long. So now, Robin has 20 - 8 = 12 inches of hair left.
Response:  If Danny has 12 caps of boats in his collection and he took out 53 caps of boats from the park, then we need to find out how many caps of boats are left with him now. So, the number of caps of boats that Danny has now is: 12 - 53 = -41. Therefore, Danny has -41 caps of boats in his collection now.
Response:  If Danny has 21 caps of boats in his collection and he found 53 more caps of boats in the park, then we can calculate the total number of caps of boats that Danny has now as follows: Total Number of Caps = 21 + 53 = 74 So, Danny has 74 caps of boats in his collection now.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 63 caps of boats in Danny's collection and he has given away 51 of them to his friends. So, the number of caps of boats left with him is 63 - 51 = 12. Now, there are 33 caps of boats in his collection now. Therefore, the number of caps of boats that Danny had initially was 12 + 33 = 45.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 caps from the park and returned 35 of them to their owners. So, he has 1 more cap than the number of caps he returned. Therefore, the number of caps Danny collected is equal to 36 - 35 = 1.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 30 caps of boats in his collection and he gave away 63 old ones from the park. Now, there are 42 caps of boats in his collection. So, the number of caps of boats that Danny sold is:  Number of new caps = Total number of caps - Initial number of caps = 42 - 30 = 12. Therefore, Danny sold 12 caps of boats outside the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 caps and 8 wrappers in his collection initially. Now he has 28 caps and 63 wrappers. So, we can calculate how many more caps he got as follows:  Number of additional caps = New number of caps - Initial number of caps = 28 - 22 = 6  Therefore, Danny now has 6 more caps than he did initially.
Response:  We know that Danny had 22 caps and 30 wrappers in his collection initially. Now he has 17 caps and 57 wrappers. So, we can calculate the number of wrappers that Danny had initially as follows: Number of wrappers = Initially 30 - Currently 57 = 27 wrappers Therefore, there were 27 wrappers that Danny had initially.
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 30 caps and 14 wrappers in his collection. Now he has 7 caps and 86 wrappers. To find out how many more caps Danny has than wrappers, we can subtract the number of wrappers from the number of caps:  Number of more caps = Total number of caps - Total number of wrappers  In this case, the total number of caps is 7 (which is the current number of caps Danny has) plus the initial number of caps which is 30:  Number of more caps = 7 + 30 = 37  So, Danny has 37 more caps than wrappers in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny had 11 caps and 28 wrappers in his collection initially. Now he has 68 caps and 51 wrappers. So, we need to find out how many more wrappers than caps Danny has now.  To do this, we can divide the number of wrappers (51) by the number of caps (68). This gives us a ratio of wrappers per cap = 51/68 = 0.74 or approximately 3/4. Therefore, Danny has approximately 3/4 more wrappers than caps in his collection now.
Response:  According to the problem, Danny had 71 caps and 24 wrappers in his collection initially. Then, he got 28 more caps but lost 16 wrappers. So, how many caps does Danny have now? We can calculate it as follows: Number of caps = Initial number of caps + Additional caps - Lost wrappers Initially, Danny had 71 caps + 28 more caps = 99 caps However, he lost 16 wrappers, so the total number of caps he has now is: Number of caps = 99 caps - 16 wrappers = 83 caps Therefore, Danny has 83 caps now.
"Response:  We know that Danny had 10 bottles and 62 wrappers in his collection initially. Now he has 27 bottles and 43 wrappers. So, we can calculate the difference between the initial number of bottles and the current number of bottles as follows:

Difference = Current Number - Initial Number = 27 - 10 = 17

Similarly, we can calculate the difference between the initial number of wrappers and the current number of wrappers as follows:

Difference = Current Number - Initial Number = 43 - 62 = -29

So, there are 17 more bottles and 29 fewer wrappers in Danny's collection now than there were initially."
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 caps of boats in his collection. Then, he lost some of them and now he has 25 caps left. So, the number of caps that Danny had at first is equal to the number of caps he has now minus the number of caps he lost. In other words: Number of caps Danny had at first = Number of caps he has now - Number of caps he lost. Solving for the number of caps he had at first, we get: Number of caps Danny had at first = 25 - 66 = -41. Therefore, Danny had 41 caps of boats in his collection at first.
Response:  If Danny had 32 bottle caps in his collection before going to the park and he found 25 more bottle caps at the park, then we can calculate how many total bottle caps Danny has now as follows: Total number of bottle caps = Previous number of bottle caps + Number of new bottle caps Found = 32 + 25 = 57 So, Danny currently has 57 bottle caps in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny initially had 60 old caps and he found 58 new caps in the park before throwing away 6 of them. So, now he has 67 caps in his collection. To find out how many caps Danny had at first, we can use the following equation: Number of caps Danny had at first = Total number of caps he has now - Number of caps he threw away. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of caps Danny had at first = 67 - 6 = 61. Therefore, Danny had 61 caps at first.
Response:  At first, Danny had 6 caps of boats that he put into his collection while he found 50 new caps of boats to add to his collection. Now, he has 60 caps of boats in his collection. So, we can deduce that Danny added 44 more caps of boats to his collection than what he initially had (6 + 50 = 66). Therefore, the number of caps of boats that Danny collected is 44.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 caps in the park and had 48 caps before he started collecting them. So, initially, he had 0 caps less than what he collected in the park (54 - 48 = 6). Now, he has 52 caps in his collection. Therefore, the number of caps he gave away is equal to the difference between the total number of caps he collected and the current number of caps in his collection (52 - 6 = 46). So, Danny gave away 46 caps.
"Response: 
Danny had 82 packages and 29 bottles in his collection initially. If he received 42 new caps for his bottles, that means he has 82 - 42 = 40 remaining packages.  Similarly, if he received 61 wrappers, that means he has 61 - 29 = 32 remaining bottles. So, Danny originally had 40 packages and 32 bottles in his collection."
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 66 packages and 39 bottles of water. Now he has 16 caps left in his collection. So, we can calculate the number of wrappers Danny had before as follows: Number of wrappers = Total number of packages x Number of packages per wrapper Total number of packages = 66 packages Collected packages = 39 bottles of water + 27 packages (since each package contains 4 wrappers) Therefore, the number of wrappers Danny had before is: Number of wrappers = 66 packages x 4 wrappers/package = 252 wrappers
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 packages and 50 bottles in the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps Danny has than wrapper, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the total number of bottle caps. So, the answer is: More bottle caps (21 - 52 = -31).
Response:  We know that Danny had 65 packages and 5 boxes of boat. Now he has 31 caps and 9 wrappers in his collection. To find out how many more wrappers than caps Danny has, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of caps. So, the difference between the number of wrappers and caps is: 9 - 31 = -22. Therefore, there are 22 fewer wrappers than caps in Danny's collection.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Danny has collected 58 bottle caps and 25 wrapper wrappers.  Now, he has 11 packages and 12 bottles with him. So, if we subtract the number of wrappers from the total number of items that Danny had before, we get:  
Total number of items = Number of bottle caps + Number of wrapper wrappers - Number of packages - Number of bottles
= 58 + 25 - 11 - 12
= 94
Therefore, Danny has 94 bottle caps now than he did when he started collecting them."
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 67 baluts and 35 wrappers, which means he has a total of 102 items in his collection (67 + 35 = 102). Now, we need to find out how many packages Danny has. According to the problem, Danny had 15 caps and 18 wrappers initially, so he must have collected additional packages since then. Therefore, the number of packages Danny has now is equal to the number of packages he had initially minus the number of caps and wrappers he already collected. In other words, Package = Initial Packages - Caps Collected - Wrappers Collected. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Package = 15 - 15 x 2 = 15 - 30 = -15 packages. So, Danny has collected more packages than he originally had.
Response:  If Jake has 11 more peaches than Steven, then the total number of peaches that Jake has is 11 + 17 = 28. So, Steven has 28 - 11 = 17 peaches.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jake has more peaches than Steven but fewer than Jill. So, if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has x - 7 peaches and Jill has x + 7 peaches. We are also told that Steven has 15 peaches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x = 15 - (7 + x)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9
So, Jake has 9 peaches."
Response:  We know that Jake has more peaches than Steven (18 vs 13). So if we add Jake and Steven together, we get 31 peaches in total. Now, let's subtract Jill's peaches from the total number of peaches. According to the question, Jill has 19 peaches. Therefore, the remaining peaches after subtracting Jill's are 31 - 19 = 12 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 7 peaches because he has 10 peaches in total. So, we can say that Jake has x peaches where x is greater than 7. Now, let's compare this with Jill who has 8 peaches. Since Jill has fewer peaches than Jake, we can say that Jake has at least 2 more peaches than Jill (x > 8). Therefore, the difference between the number of peaches owned by Jake and Jill is 2 (x - 8 = 2).
Response:  We know that Jill has more than 11 peaches and Jake has less than 12 peaches. So, we can say that Jill has x number of peaches where x is greater than 11. Now, we also know that Steven has 4 peaches. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  X + 4 = 11 (where X represents the total number of peaches owned by Jill)  Solving for X, we get:  X = 15  Therefore, Jill has 15 peaches more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has more peaches than Steven and less than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x number of peaches between 7 and 9 inclusive. Since Steven has 16 peaches, we can deduce that Jake has fewer than 16 peaches. Therefore, the number of peaches Jake has is between 7 and 15 (inclusive). The closest integer to this range is 10, so the answer is 10.
"Response:  We know that Jake has more peaches than Steven and Jill combined. So if Jake has x peaches, then Steven has y peaches (where y < x), and Jill has z peaches (where z < y). Since Jake has 7 more peaches than Steven, we can write:  x = y + 7. Similarly, since Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill, we can write:  z = y - 8. Now we have two equations:  x = y + 7; z = y - 8. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:  x = 20; y = 9; z = 4. Therefore, Jill has 4 peaches."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 9 more peaches than Steven and Jill together have 18 more peaches than Jake. So, if we subtract the number of peaches that Jake has from the total number of peaches that Jill and Steven have, we will get the difference between the number of peaches that Steven has and the number of peaches that Jill has. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Difference = Total number of peaches (Jill + Steven) - Number of peaches (Jake) = 27 - 9 = 18
Response:  If Jake has 6 more peaches than Steven, then Jake has x peaches and Steven has 6.  Since Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, Steven has y peaches and Jill has z peaches.  We know that Jake has x + 6 = 18 peaches.  Therefore, Jake has 12 peaches (x + 6).
"Response:  According to the given information:
Si Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 5 peaches.
Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, if Jill has y peaches, then Steven has y + 18 peaches.
Since Jill has 87 peaches, we can say that Jake has x - 5 peaches, and Steven has y + 18 peaches. Now, let's find out how many more or fewer peaches Jake has compared to Jill:
x - 5 = 87 (Jake's peaches)
So, Jake has 82 more peaches than Jill (87 - 5). Therefore, the correct answer is:
Jake has 82 more peaches than Jill."
Response:  According to the problem, Jake has 16 more peaches than Steven. So if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has 16 + x peaches. Similarly, according to the second part of the problem, Steven has y more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jill has x - y peaches. Now we need to find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. We can do this by subtracting Jake's number of peaches from Jill's number of peaches:  Number of peaches that Jill has more than Jake = Jill's number of peaches - Jake's number of peaches  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of peaches that Jill has more than Jake = 12 - (16 + x)  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 9  Therefore, Jill has 9 more peaches than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 12 but fewer than 19 persimmons. So, we can say that Jake has between 13 and 18 persimmons. Since he also has more than 79 but fewer than 140 mangoes, we can conclude that Jake has between 80 and 139 mangoes. Therefore, Jake has 135 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has more fruits than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's total number of fruits. According to the question, Jake has 13 more peaches and 3 more mangos than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 13 + 3 = 16 more fruits than Steven. Since Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples, he has a total of 9 + 8 = 17 fruits. So, Jake has 17 - 17 = 0 fruits more than Steven.
"Response: 
Jake has 6 more peaches than Steven. So, if Jake has x peaches, Steven has x - 6 mansanas.
We know that Jake has 8 more mangoes than Steven. So, if Jake has y mangoes, Steven has y - 8 mansanas.
Now we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:
x + (y - 8) = 17...(1)
Since Jake has more peaches than mangoes, we know that x > y. Substituting this inequality into Equation (1), we get:
x + (y - 8) > 17...(2)
Now let's solve for x. We can first subtract y from both sides of Equation (2):
x > y + 8...(3)
Next, we can divide both sides of Equation (3) by y to find out how many more peaches Jake has than Steven:
x / y > 9...(4)
So, Jake has approximately 9 more peaches than Steven."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more peaches than Steven. So if Jake has x peaches and Steven has y mansanas, we can write an equation as follows:
Jake - Steven = 3
x - y = 3
Now, we are also given that Jake has 10 times more mangoes than Steven. This means that for every one mango of Steven, Jake has ten mangoes. Therefore, we can write another equation:
x/y = 10
Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving them simultaneously gives us the values of x and y:
x = 18
y = 6
So, Jake has 18 peaches and 6 mangoes more than Steven."
Response:  According to the given information, Steven has 12 peaches and Jake has 4 more than Steven which means he has 12 + 4 = 16 peaches. So, Jake has 16 peaches.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Steven has 18 peaches.
Jake has more than 12 peaches but fewer than 18 peaches.
Jill has fewer peaches than both Steven and Jake.
From this information, we can conclude that Jill has at least 8 peaches. Therefore, the correct answer is 8."
Response:  According to the problem, Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has more than 12 but fewer than 72 peaches. So, we can say that Jake has x number of peaches where x is between 12 and 72. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this inequality. We know that Jake has more peaches than Steven, so x must be greater than 19. Also, since Jake has fewer peaches than Jill, x must be less than 72. Therefore, the value of x is between 19 and 72, inclusive. Since there are only 60 days in June, the answer is 48.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Steven has 14 peaches.
Jake has more than 6 peaches but fewer than Steven. So Jake has x peaches where x is greater than 6 and less than or equal to 14.
Jill has fewer than both Steven and Jake. So Jill has y peaches where y is less than x and less than or equal to 6.
From the problem statement, we know that Jake has more peaches than Jill. Therefore, x > y.
Now, let's find out how many peaches Jill has:
y = number of peaches Jill has (less than or equal to 6)
x = number of peaches Jake has (greater than 6 and less than or equal to 14)
Substituting y with 6, we get:
x > 6
Solving for x, we get:
x = 9
So, Jake has 9 peaches more than Steven, and Jill has 3 peaches less than Jake."
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 84 mangoes and fewer than 10 peaches. So, we can say that Jake has x number of peaches where x is between 84 and 10. Now, we also know that Steven has 13 peaches and 52 mangoes. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of peaches = 13 + (x - 84)  Substituting the value for x from the problem statement, we get:  Number of peches = 13 + (-76)  Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:  Number of peaches = 69  Therefore, Jake has 69 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has more peaches than Steven. So, we can start with Jake's total number of fruits. According to the question, Jake has 13 more mangoes than Steven, which means he has 13 + 8 = 21 mangoes in total. Now, let's count how many mangoes and peaches Jake has altogether. According to the question, Jake has 17 more peaches than Steven, which means he has 17 + 12 = 39 peaches in total. Therefore, Jake has 21 (mangoes) + 39 (peaches) = 60 fruits in total.
Response:  If Jake has 8 more peaches than Steven, then Jake has 8 + 11 = 19 peaches in total. Since Steven has 18 peaches, there are more peaches with Jake. Therefore, the answer is 19 - 18 = 1 more peach than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 more peaches than Steven. So if Jake has x peaches and Steven has y mansanas, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 3 = y  Now, we are also given that Steven has 19 mansanas. Therefore, we can substitute this value in the previous equation to get:  x + 3 = 19  Solving for x, we get:  x = 16  So, Jake has 16 more mansanas than Steven.
"Response:  If Olivia spent $15 at the supermarket and she had $78 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate the remaining amount of money she has as follows:

$78 - $15 = $63

So, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet after spending $15 at the supermarket."
"Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 left over, then we can calculate how much money she has left as follows:

$33 (amount left) = $78 (total spent) - $45 (amount spent)

So, Olivia has $33 left over after spending $78 at the supermarket."
Response:  The total amount of money that Olivia had in her wallet before she withdrew $148 from an ATM was $100 + $100 = $200. After withdrawing $148 from the ATM, her new balance became $200 - $148 = $52. Then, after visiting the supermarket and spending $159, her new balance became $52 + $159 = $211. Therefore, the gain or profit made by Olivia is $211 - $100 = $111.
Response:  If Olivia withdrew $49 from her wallet and spent it at the supermarket, then she has $0 left in her wallet. So, the amount of money that she collected more than what she spent is $49 - $0 = $49. Therefore, the correct answer is $49.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Olivia has $53 in her wallet and she withdraws $91 from an ATM. So, initially, she had $53 + $91 = $144. Now, after visiting the supermarket, she spent $14. Therefore, her remaining balance after buying something at the supermarket is $144 - $14 = $130.
Response:  If Olivia spent $49 at the showroom and she had $106 in her wallet before going to the supermarket, then she must have spent some amount of money at the supermarket as well. So, let's calculate how much she spent at the supermarket: Total amount spent = Amount spent at showroom + Amount spent at supermarket = $49 + ( $106 - $49 ) = $157 Now we know that Olivia spent $157 at both places combined.
"Response:  If Olivia spent $29 at the supermarket and she had $54 in her wallet before going to the store, then we can calculate how much change she got as follows:

$29 (amount spent) - $54 (initial amount in wallet) = $ -25

So, Olivia received $25 in change after buying something at the supermarket."
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet before going to the store, then we can calculate how much money she has left as follows:  Money spent = $38  Money remaining = $128 - $38 = $90 So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after buying things at the supermarket.
Response:  If Dave has 19 apps installed on his phone and he selects 5 of them, then there are 14 remaining apps that were not selected. So, the number of apps installed on Dave's phone is 14.
Response:  If there were 18 apps in Dave's phone before he deleted 5 of them, then there are 13 apps left in his phone after deleting 5. So, the answer is 13.
Response:  If Dave had 10 apps installed on his phone and he added 11 new ones, then the total number of apps would be 21 (10 + 11). After deleting some of them, there were 4 remaining apps that Dave did not delete. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Dave had 21 apps in his phone and he added 89 new ones, then the total number of apps in his phone now is: 21 + 89 = 106. After deleting some of them, there are still 24 apps left in his phone. So, the number of apps that Dave added more than what he deleted is: 106 - 24 = 82.
Response:  If Dave had 15 apps in his phone and he added 71 new ones, then the total number of apps in his phone now is 86 (15 + 71).  After deleting some of them, there were only 14 left. So, the number of apps that Dave deleted is equal to the number of apps he added minus the number of apps remaining after deletion. Therefore, the answer is 71 - 14 = 57 apps.
Response:  If Dave had 16 apps and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 16 - 5 = 11 apps left. Similarly, if he deleted 23 files, he now has 11 - 23 = -12 files in his phone. So, Dave deleted 5 apps and 23 files.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps and 21 files in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he had 3 apps and 7 files left. So, the number of files that he deleted is 7 - 7 = 0.
Response:  If Dave had 15 apps and 24 files in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he had 21 apps and 4 files left. So, the number of apps that were left in his phone is 21 - 15 = 6 more than the number of apps he initially had. Similarly, the number of files that were left in his phone is 4 - 24 = -20 fewer than the number of files he initially had. Therefore, there are 6 more apps and -20 more files in Dave's phone now compared to what he initially had.
Response:  If Dave had 19 apps and 18 files in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he has 6 apps and 15 files left in his phone. So, the number of files that Dave has more than the number of apps is 15 - 6 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 more files than apps in Dave's phone.
Response:  If Dave had 17 apps before adding more, and after adding more, he now has 18 apps, then we can say that... (read more)
Response:  If Dave had 59 files and applications in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting 12 apps and 30 files, he has 47 files and applications left (59 - 12 = 47). So, Dave deleted 17 apps (12 + 30 = 42) and 13 files (30 - 15 = 13).
Response:  If Dave had 24 files and applications in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he had 17 applications and 21 files left. So, the number of files that he deleted is:  Number of files left - Number of files before = 21 - 24 = -3 files. Therefore, Dave deleted 3 files from his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 24 apps and 9 files in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he has 5 files and 12 apps left. So, the number of apps that were left in his phone is 12 - 12 = 0. Therefore, there are no apps left in Dave's phone.
Response:  If Dave had 11 apps and 3 files in his phone before he deleted some of them, then after deleting some of them, he has 24 files left and 2 apps remaining. So, the number of files that were left in his phone is 24 - 3 = 21.
Response:  We know that Nell has 242 cards in total and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate the number of cards left with Nell as follows:  Number of cards left with Nell = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 242 - 136 = 106 cards. Therefore, there are 106 cards left with Nell.
Response:  Initially, there were 301 cards in Jeff's collection and now there are 154 cards left. So, we can say that initially, Nell had x number of cards. Now, since there are only 154 cards left, we know that x - 154 = 301. Solving for x, we get x = 157. Therefore, initially, Nell had 157 cards from Jeff's collection.
Response:  We know that Nell has 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, initially, Jeff had 11 cards. Now, we are told that after receiving more cards from Nell, Jeff has 252 cards. Therefore, the number of cards that Nell gave to Jeff is:  Number of cards given by Nell to Jeff = Total number of cards of Jeff now - Initial number of cards of Jeff = 252 - 11 = 241 cards.
Response:  We know that Nagkolekta has 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, Nagkolekta had fewer cards than Jeff initially. Now, Nagkolekta has 535 cards while Jeff has 234 cards. To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we subtract the number of cards Nagkolekta gave him from his initial number of cards: 234 - (cards given to Nagkolekta) = x Where x is the number of cards Jeff has now. Since Nagkolekta gave Jeff some cards, we can say that x > 0. Therefore, Jeff has x cards now.
Response:  We know that Nell has 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has fewer cards than before. Specifically, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has compared to the 10 cards she had initially, we can subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from the total number of cards she had: 415 - 309 = 106. So, Nell has 106 more baseball cards than she did when she started.
Response:  We know that Nell has 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now, she has 404 baseball cards in total (including the ones she kept). So, we can calculate the number of cards she had before giving any to Jeff as follows: Number of cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff = Total number of cards she has now - Number of cards she gave to Jeff = 404 - 246 = 158 cards. Therefore, there are 158 more cards than what Nell initially had compared to the number of baseball cards she has now.
Response:  We know that Nell has 573 cards of baseball in total and she gave 195 to John. So, the number of cards left with her is 573 - 195 = 378. Now, we are told that there are 210 more cards given to Jeff than what Nell had. Therefore, the number of cards given to Jeff is 210 - 378 = -168. Since it can't be negative, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  We know that there are 438 baseball cards in total and 18 of them belong to Nell. So, the number of baseball cards belonging to Jeff is 438 - 18 = 420. Now, we are given that he received additional 55 10-card sets and 178 baseball cards. Therefore, the total number of baseball cards he has now is 420 + 55 x 10 = 420 + 550 = 970. As for the 10-card sets, since each set contains 10 cards, the total number of 10-card sets he has now is 55. So, the total number of cards he has including both baseball cards and 10-card sets is 970 + 55 = 1025.
"Response:  We know that Nell has 239 baseball cards and gave away some of them to Jeff. Now, she has 376 ten-card packs and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Jeff, we can subtract the number of baseball cards Jeff has from the total number of baseball cards Nell has. So, the difference between Nell's baseball cards and Jeff's is:

Nell's baseball cards - Jeff's baseball cards = 239 - 111 = 128

Therefore, Nell has 128 more baseball cards than Jeff."
Response:  If Paco had 19 cookies initially and he ate 35 more, then the total number of cookies he consumed is equal to 19 + 35 = 54 cookies. So, the answer is 54.
Response:  If Paco had 28 cookies and he ate some of them, then he has fewer cookies left. We know that he ate 7 cookies, so we can subtract 7 from 28 to find out how many cookies Paco has left. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco ate is 21 (28 - 7).
Response:  If Paco bought 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them, then there are 38 remaining cookies. When he went back to buy more cookies, he bought 37 additional cookies. So, in total, Paco has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies now. Therefore, 75 is the number of cookies that remain after Paco finished buying and eating all the cookies.
Response:  If Paco had eaten 5 cookies and then bought 3 more, that means he has a total of 8 cookies now (5 + 3 = 8). So, if he ate 5 cookies before buying any, it means he ate half of his total supply of cookies, which is 4 cookies (8 / 2 = 4). Therefore, the number of cookies Paco bought is equal to the number of cookies he did not eat, which is 4 - 5 = -1 cookie.
Response:  If Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them, then he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left.  When he bought more cookies, he bought 36 additional cookies. So, in total, Paco now has 11 + 36 = 47 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco bought is 47 - 11 = 36 cookies more than the number of cookies he initially had.
Response:  If Paco has 40 cookies and he eats 5 of them, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left.  Now, he gives 13 to his friend, so he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, there are 22 cookies remaining for Paco.
Response:  If Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them, then he has 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies.  Now, he gave 13 to his friend. So, the number of cookies that Paco ate is equal to the number of cookies he gave away minus the number of cookies he still has, which is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them, then he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left.  But then, he gave his friend 21 cookies, so he must have given away all of the cookies he had left (-4), plus some extra (21 - (-4) = 25). So, the number of cookies that Paco gave to his friend is 25.
Response:  We know that Paco had 22 matamis na cookies and 75 malat na cookies in total. He ate 15 matamis na cookies, which means he has 22 - 15 = 6 remaining matamis na cookies left. Now, we also know that he ate 54 na masarap na cookies, which means he has 0 remaining na masarap na cookies since he already ate all of them. Therefore, the number of matamis na cookies that remained with Paco is 6.
Response:  If Paco had 9 matamis na cookies and he ate 3 of them, then he has 9 - 3 = 6 left. Similarly, if he had 6 masarap na cookies and he ate 3 of them, then he has 6 - 3 = 3 left. So, the number of salty cookies that remained after Paco finished eating is 6 + 3 = 9.
Response:  If Paco had 37 matamis na cookies and he ate 5 of them, then he has 37 - 5 = 32 left. Similarly, if he ate 2 maalat na cookies, he has 32 - 2 = 30 left. So, Paco has more matamis na cookies than maalat na cookies. Therefore, the answer is 30.
Response:  If Paco consumed 20 matamis na cookies and 34 masarap na cookies, then he consumed a total of 54 cookies (20 + 34). Since he had 8 matamis na cookies and 6 masarap na cookies in total, that means he has eaten more masarap na cookies than matamis na cookies. Therefore, the number of masarap na cookies he ate is greater than the number of matamis na cookies he ate. So, the answer is 34 - 8 = 26.
Response:  If Paco has eaten 36 cookies and he has 37 cookies in total, then he must have had some left over after eating 36 cookies. So, the number of cookies that Paco has left is equal to the total number of cookies he has minus the number of cookies he has already eaten. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of cookies left = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies eaten = 37 - 36 = 1.
Response:  If Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend, then he has 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22). Since his friend ate 10 of those remaining cookies, Paco now has 12 cookies left (22 - 10 = 12). So, the number of cookies that remained with Paco is 12.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies in total and gave away 9 to his friend. So, he has 32 cookies left (41 - 9 = 32). Now, he ate 18 cookies, leaving him with 14 cookies (32 - 18 = 14). Therefore, Paco ate more cookies than he gave away. The difference between the number of cookies he ate and the number he gave away is 14 - 9 = 5.
Response:  If Paco had 6 cookies and gave away 30, then he has 30 - 6 = 24 cookies left.  He also ate 23 cookies, so he has 24 - 23 = 1 cookie left. Therefore, the number of cookies that Paco gave away is greater than the number he ate.
Response:  If Paco had 34 sweet cookies and he ate 15 of them, then he has 34 - 15 = 19 sweet cookies left.  Similarly, if he had 97 savory cookies and he ate 56 of them, then he has 97 - 56 = 41 savory cookies left. So, the number of sweet cookies that Paco ate is 19.
Response:  If Paco had 26 naasins and 17 matamis na cookies, then he had a total of 43 cookies (26 + 17). Since he ate 14 matamis na cookies and 9 malat na cookies, he left with 20 matamis na cookies and 9 malat na cookies. So, the number of salty cookies that remained after Paco finished eating is 20.
Response:  If Paco had 39 matamis na cookies and he ate 23 of them, then he has 16 remaining (39 - 23 = 16).  Similarly, if he had 6 maalat na cookies and he ate 32 of them, then he has 0 remaining (6 - 32 = 0). So, the number of matamis na cookies that Paco ate is greater than the number of maalat na cookies that he ate. Therefore, the answer is 16 > 0 = 16.
Response:  If Paco consumed 28 more malat na cookies than he did matamis na cookies, then the number of malat na cookies he consumed is equal to 28 - 15 = 13. Similarly, if he consumed 15 more matamis na cookies than he did malat na cookies, then the number of matamis na cookies he consumed is equal to 15 - 13 = 2. Therefore, the total number of cookies that Paco consumed is 13 + 2 = 15. So, the answer is 15.
Response:  According to the problem, Gwen received $7 and spent $3. So she has $4 left. Then, she gave $2 to her friend. Now, let's calculate how much money Gwen has left after giving $2 to her friend.  $4 (amount left) - $2 (amount given to friend) = $2 (amount left with Gwen). Therefore, Gwen has $2 left after giving $2 to her friend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her birthday party and she had $6 left after buying some gifts. So, the total amount of money Gwen received is: $8 + $6 = $14. Therefore, the correct answer is $14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mother. Then, she was given $4 by her father. If she spent $3, then... (Gwen has $2 + $4 - $3 = $1 left). So, Gwen now has $1 left after spending $3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. So far, she has received a total of $13 ($8 + $5). Now, let's find out how much she spent. According to the question, she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money she received from her mother minus the amount she spent is equal to the amount she received from her father. In other words, $13 - $4 = $9. So, Gwen received $9 more from her father than she gave to her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father. So far, she has received a total of $9 ($3 + $6). Now, we are told that she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money left with her after spending is $9 - $4 = $5. So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her father is greater than the amount she received from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. So far, she has received a total of $12. Then, she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money left with her is $12 - $4 = $8. So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her mother is greater than the amount she received from her father.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother. So far, she has received a total of $7 ( $5 + $2). Now, if she spent $6, then she will have $1 left ($7 - $6 = $1). Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen received from her father is greater than the amount she received from her mother.
Response:  If Josh has 9 marbles in his collection and some of them are missing, then he has 4 marbles left now. So, the number of marbles that were lost is 9 - 4 = 5.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and he lost 9 of them, then he has 12 marbles left in his collection. So, if he now has 12 marbles, that means he had 3 more marbles before he lost 9 of them. Therefore, the number of marbles Josh has in his collection is 3 + 12 = 15 marbles.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 marbles in his collection. Then, 11 of them disappeared and only 5 new ones appeared. So, the number of marbles that Josh has now is: 19 - 11 = 8 + 5 = 13. Therefore, Josh has 13 marbles in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had 4 original marbles and lost 16 of them, then he has 4 - 16 = -12 marbles left. Since he found 8 new marbles, his total number of marbles now is -12 + 8 = 6. So, there are 6 fewer marbles that Josh originally had than the ones he found.
Response:  If Josh has 7 marbles in his collection and one of them is lost, then he has 6 marbles left.  If another marble appears and disappears again, he now has 5 marbles left.  Finally, if 10 new marbles appear, he now has 15 marbles (7 + 6 = 13 + 10 = 15). So, the number of marbles that Josh found more than what he had initially is 15 - 7 = 8.
Response:  If Josh has 21 marbles in his collection and he takes away 7 of them, then he will have 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left. So, Josh has 14 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh has 20 marbles in his collection and he gives 2 to Jack, then Josh now has 18 marbles left (20 - 2 = 18). So, the number of marbles that Josh has today is 18.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 marbles in his collection. Then, Jack gave him 20 more marbles. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 marbles.
Response:  According to the question, Josh had 11 marbles in his collection before he lost some of them. Now, he has 19 marbles left in his collection. So, we can calculate how many marbles he lost as follows: Number of marbles lost = Total number of marbles before - Current number of marbles  Number of marbles lost = 11 - 19  Number of marbles lost = 8 Therefore, Josh lost 8 marbles from his original collection.
Response:  If Josh has 22 marbles in his collection and he lost 5 of them, then he has 22 - 5 = 17 marbles left. So, Josh has 17 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh has 15 marbles in his collection and he found 9 of them while he was away for 23 marbles, then we can say that the number of marbles he had when he went away is equal to the number of marbles he found minus the number of marbles he lost. So, if he had 15 marbles initially and lost 23 marbles, then the number of marbles he found would be 9 - 23 = -14. Therefore, there are 14 fewer marbles in Josh's collection than he originally had.
Response:  If Josh has 3 marbles in his collection and he finds 6 more while they were missing, then he now has a total of 9 marbles (3 + 6 = 9). So, there are 9 marbles that Josh found plus the 5 marbles that went missing, which is equal to 14 marbles in total (9 + 5 = 14). Therefore, there are 14 marbles left after finding the missing ones.
Response:  If Marco's strawberries weigh 19 pounds and his mother's strawberries weigh 4 pounds, then the difference in weight between their strawberries is:  19 - 4 = 15 pounds. So, Marco's strawberries are heavier than his mother's strawberries by 15 pounds.
Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries is 13 pounds, and his mother's strawberries weigh 35 pounds. To find out how much heavier Marco's strawberries are compared to his mother's, we can subtract their weights from each other:  Weight of Marco's strawberries - Weight of his mother's strawberries = Difference in weight  $13$ - $35$ = $-22$ pounds  Therefore, Marco's strawberries are $22$ pounds heavier than his mother's strawberries.
Response:  If Marco's mother has 30 strawberries and each strawberry weighs 20 pounds, then the total weight of all her strawberries is: 30 x 20 = 600 pounds. Now, if Marco's strawberries weigh 17 pounds less than his mother's strawberries, then their total weight is: 600 - (17 x number of Marco's strawberries) =?  Therefore, the total weight of Marco's strawberries is 600 - (17 x 20) = 600 - 340 = 260 pounds. So, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 260 pounds.
Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries is given as 8 pounds and his mother's strawberries are given as 32 pounds. To find out how much heavier Marco's strawberries are than his mother's, we can subtract their weights:  Weight of Marco's strawberries - Weight of his mother's strawberries = 8 pounds - 32 pounds = 24 pounds So, Marco's strawberries are 24 pounds heavier than his mother's.
Response:  If Marco and his mother together picked 24 pounds of strawberries (which is equal to 10.8 kilograms), then Marco had 9 pounds of strawberries left after he took some away (which is equal to 4 kilograms). Since Marco's share was 3 pounds (which is equal to 1.36 kilograms), we can calculate how much strawberries his mother had by subtracting Marco's share from the total amount they picked:  Total weight of strawberries = 24 pounds x 10.8 kilograms/pound = 257.6 kilograms Strawberries left for Marco's mother = Total weight - Marco's share = 257.6 kilograms - 4 kilograms = 253.6 kilograms So, the weight of strawberries that Marco's mother had is approximately 253.6 kilograms or 558.4 pounds.
Response:  At first, Marco and his mother together picked 36 pounds of strawberries. After that, when they returned, Marco's mother lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Now, Marco has 12 pounds of strawberries left. So, the total weight of strawberries owned by Marco's mother now is: 36 - 8 = 28 pounds + 12 = 40 pounds. Therefore, the weight of strawberries owned by Marco's mother now is 40 pounds.
Response:  If Marco and his father together picked 22 pounds of strawberries, then they must have picked half of them (11 pounds) each. So, if Marco's father picked 30 pounds more than he did, then his father must have picked 41 pounds (30 - 11 = 41). Now, since Marco's mother also picked some strawberries, let's assume that she picked x pounds. Since Marco himself picked only 11 pounds, we can say that his mother picked x - 11 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all the strawberries picked by Marco's family is equal to the sum of their individual weights: 22 + 41 + (x - 11) = 74 pounds. But we are told that the total weight of all the strawberries is now 36 pounds, so we can set up the equation:  74 = x - 11. Solving for x, we get: x = 53 pounds. Thus, the weight of the strawberries picked by Marco's mother today is 53 pounds.
Response:  If Marco and his mother have a total of 37 pounds of strawberries together, then the weight of Marco's strawberries is 37 / 2 = 18.5 pounds. Since each strawberry weighs 15 pounds, the number of strawberries that Marco has is 18.5 / 15 = 12 strawberries. Therefore, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 12 x 15 = 180 pounds.
Response:  The total weight of Marco's strawberries is given as 30 pounds. If he and his mother together have 17 pounds of strawberries, then the weight of Marco's strawberries is: 30 - (Marco's share + Mother's share) = 30 - (x + y), where x is Marco's share and y is his mother's share. We are told that Marco's share is less than half of the total weight of strawberries, so we can write: x < 15 (since 30 > 2x). Now we need to find out what value of x satisfies this inequality. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x < 15 / 2 = 7.5. So Marco has 7.5 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  The total weight of Marco's and his mother's strawberries is 26 pounds. If Marco has 10 pounds of strawberries, then his mother must have x pounds of strawberries, where x is the difference between 26 and 10, or 16 pounds. So, the weight of Marco's mother's strawberries is 16 pounds.
Response:  If Marco's mother has 11 pounds of strawberries and together with Marco they have 30 pounds of strawberries, then we can calculate the number of pounds of strawberries that Marco has as follows:  Weight of Marco's share = Total weight of strawberries / Number of people sharing them = 30 pounds / 2 (people) = 15 pounds So, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 15 pounds.
Response:  At first, there were two children who rode the bus (Dalawang bata). Then, more children boarded the bus at the bus stop (ilang mga bata pa ang sumakay sa bus), resulting in a total of ten children riding the bus (sampung batal ang nasa bus). Therefore, there are five fewer children riding the bus now compared to when it left the terminal (ilan pa bang batal ang nasa bus ngayong kaysa sa mga bago ang bus stop). So, the answer is 5.
Response:  The first child is 26 years old and boards the bus at the bus stop. Then there are 38 children who boarded the bus after him. So, in total, there are 38 + 1 = 39 children who are currently riding the bus.
Response:  Firstly, there are three children who boarded the bus at the start (May mga bata na nasa bus). Then, two more children got off the bus before reaching the next stop (sa bus stop 2 pang bata ang sumakay sa bus). Finally, there were 41 children remaining in the bus when it reached its destination (Ilalang batang sumakay sa bus bago ang bus stop). Therefore, the total number of children who boarded the bus is: 3 + 2 = 5.
Response:  If there were initially 43 children who boarded the bus at the bus stop and 21 children got off the bus afterward, then we need to find out how many children got off the bus before the 21 children did so. We can do this by subtracting the number of children who got off from the total number of children who boarded the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to 43 - 21 = 22. So, there are 22 children who got off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 children who boarded the bus. Then, we were told that 18 children got off the bus before reaching the bus stop. So, the number of children remaining in the bus when it reached the bus stop is equal to the total number of children who boarded minus the number of children who got off. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows: Number of children remaining = Total number of children who boarded - Number of children who got off Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total number of children who boarded = 41 Number of children who got off = 18 Therefore, the number of children remaining in the bus when it reached the bus stop is: Number of children remaining = 41 - 18 = 23 So, there are 23 children remaining in the bus when it reached the bus stop.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 children who got off the bus at the bus stop. Then, 4 more children boarded the bus after them (May 16). So, in total, how many children boarded the bus at the bus stop?  Therefore, the answer is 10 + 4 = 14 children who boarded the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 63 children who boarded the bus at the bus stop. Then, 14 more children got on the bus while it was moving. So, in total, how many children got on the bus?  We can calculate this as follows:  Total number of children getting on the bus = Number of children who boarded the bus + Number of children who got on while it was moving  Total number of children getting on the bus = 63 + 14  Total number of children getting on the bus = 77 Therefore, there were 77 children who got on the bus after they had already boarded and those who got on while it was moving.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 children who boarded the bus at the bus stop. Then, 68 children got off the bus while some others remained on it. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who remained on it minus 68. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus = 68 - x, where x is the number of children who remained on the bus. Now, we also know that 12 children were on the bus. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get: Number of children who got off the bus = 68 - (x - 12)  Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 56 Children who remained on the bus. Therefore, there were 56 children who remained on the bus after 68 children got off.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 children who boarded the bus (given in the statement). Then, we have to find out how many of them got off the bus at the bus stop. According to the problem, 40 children got off the bus while 2 were already inside the bus when it arrived at the bus stop. So, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the total number of children minus the two who were already inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus = 22 - 2 = 18. Thus, there are 18 children who got off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 children who boarded the bus at the bus stop. Then, we have 82 children who got off the bus while 30 children remained inside the bus. So, to find out how many more children entered the bus than those who left it, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who boarded the bus. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:  $28 - 82 = -54$ children. Since this value is negative, it means that fewer children entered the bus than those who left it. In other words, there were $54$ more children who got off the bus than those who boarded it.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 24 children who got off the bus and 8 children who boarded it. So, the total number of children who rode the bus is 24 + 8 = 32. Therefore, more children got off the bus than boarded it.
Response:  The baker sold 51 cakes to customers. If he made 133 cakes in total, then the number of cakes left unsold is:  Number of cakes unsold = Total number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 133 - 51 = 82 cakes. Therefore, there were 82 cakes left unsold by the baker.
"Response:  The baker has 54 cakes in total and sells some of them to Mangkok. We don't know how many cakes were sold yet. So we will assume that all 54 cakes are available for sale.
Mangkok buys x number of cakes from the baker. Since he already has 13 cakes at home, he needs to buy (54 - 13) = 41 more cakes.
The price of each cake is P100. Therefore, the cost of the cakes that Mangkok bought is:
P x = 41 x 100 = PHP4,100
So, if there are 13 cakes left with the baker after Mangkok buys some, then the baker earned a total of:
PHP4,100 - PHP1,300 = PHP2,800
Therefore, the answer is PHP2,800."
Response:  We know that the total number of cakes sold is 145 and the baker has 72 remaining after selling them all. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Cakes = Number of Cakes Sold + Number of Cakes Remaining 145 = x + 72 where 'x' represents the number of cakes sold by the baker. Now, we need to find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. To do so, we divide both sides of the equation by 145: x + 72 = 145 / 145 = 1 Since there are 1 cake left with the baker after selling all the others, the answer is 1. Therefore, the baker made $1 per cake.
"Response:  If Baker makes 155 cakes and sells them to her friend for P140 each, then she will have earned a total of:

P155 x 155 = PHP23,750 (from making and selling 155 cakes)

Now, if she still has some cakes left after selling 155 pieces, let's assume that she has 10 extra cakes left. So, the total number of cakes she has is:

155 + 10 = 165 cakes

Therefore, the number of cakes that Baker has left after selling 155 pieces is:

165 - 155 = 10 cakes

So, there are 10 cakes left with Baker after she sold 155 pieces."
Response:  The baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them. This means that he has 16 extra cakes (121 - 105 = 16). So, there are 16 more cakes left with the baker.
"Response: 
Given: 
* Mangkok made 13 cakes and sold them for P91.
* He bought 154 new cakes.
So, we have:
Mangkok's initial cakes = 13
Sales revenue from old cakes = P91
New cakes purchased = 154
Now, let's find out how many more cakes Mangkok bought than he sold:
More cakes bought = New cakes purchased - Initial cakes = 154 - 13 = 141
Therefore, Mangkok bought 141 more cakes than he sold."
Response:  The baker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. This means that he has 92 remaining cakes (170 - 78 = 92). Now, he buys 31 new cakes. So, the total number of cakes he has is 92 + 31 = 123 cakes. Therefore, the number of cakes bought by the baker is 123 - 78 = 45 cakes more than the number of cakes he sold.
Response:  The baker made 110 cakes in total. He sold 75 of them to someone else and then he made another 76 cakes after that. So, the number of cakes the baker has left is equal to the original amount minus the ones he sold. In this case, it would be: 110 - 75 = 35 cakes. Therefore, there are 35 cakes left with the baker.
Response:  The baker made 144 cakes in total and sold 71 of them. After selling some, he still had 111 cakes left to make. So, if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made, we get:  Number of cakes remaining = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes sold = 144 - 71 = 73 cakes. Therefore, the baker made more than the number of cakes he bought.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pieces of cakes and pastries are available for sale. According to the question, there are 149 cakes and 91 pastries available for sale. Now, let's assume that the baker has sold 10 cakes and 90 pastries so far. To find out how many cakes the baker still has left, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes available for sale: Number of cakes left = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes sold = 149 - 10 = 139 cakes. Similarly, to find out how many pastries the baker still has left, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries available for sale: Number of pastries left = Total number of pastries - Number of pastries sold = 91 - 90 = 1 pastry. Therefore, the baker still has 139 cakes and 1 pastry left in stock.
"Response:  The first part of the question states that ""Ang mangkok ay gumawa ng 7 cakes."" This means that he made 7 cakes. Then it says ""at 148 pastries."" So he sold 148 pastries. Now we need to find out how many pastries are in each cake. According to the second part of the question, ""Kung nagbenta siya ng 15 keys at 103 pastries,"" there are 15 keys and 103 pastries being sold. To find out how many pastries are in each key, we divide the number of pastries being sold (103) by the number of keys being sold (15): 103 / 15 = 6.93. Since you can't sell fractions of a pastry, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7. Therefore, there are 7 pastries in each cake. Now let's calculate the total number of pastries that the baker has: Total number of pastries = Number of cakes x Number of pastries per cake = 7 x 148 = 1028 pastries."
Response:  If the baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries, then he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries. To find out how many more cakes were sold than pastries, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries made: 126 - 48 = 78. So, there are 78 more cakes sold than pastries. Now, to find out how much more each cake was sold for than each pastry, we need to divide the difference between the two quantities by the number of pastries sold: $ 78 / 81 = $ 0.96$ per cake. Therefore, each additional cake was sold for $ 0.96$ more than each pastry.
Response:  The baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries in total. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, we can calculate the cost of each cake and pastry as follows:  Cost per cake = Total number of cakes x Price per cake / Number of cakes sold = 19 x $50 / 70 = $2.86 per cake Cost per pastry = Total number of pastries x Price per pastry / Number of pastries sold = 131 x $30 / 88 = $3.43 per pastry Now, let's find out how much more the baker earned from selling more pastries than cakes: Difference between price per pastry and price per cake = $3.43 - $2.86 = $0.57 per pastry Profit from selling more pastries than cakes = Number of extra pastries x ($0.57 per extra pastry) = 88 - 70 = 18 extra pastries x $0.57 = $10.16 So, the baker earned an additional $10.16 for every 88 pastries he sold instead of 70 cakes.
Response:  The baker sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries in total. To find out how many more cakes were sold than pastries, we can subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes:  158 - 147 = 11  So, the baker sold 11 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  The baker sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries for a total of 160 items (68 x 1 = 68 + 92 x 1 = 92).  If we compare this to the number of cakes and pastries that were made, we can see that the baker sold more pastries than cakes. Specifically, the baker sold 143 pastries but only 54 cakes. So, the baker sold significantly more pastries than cakes.
Response:  The baker has sold 44 cakes so far and is now making another 48 cakes. So, in total, the baker will have made 92 cakes (44 + 48).
Response:  If the baker sells each cake for P80 and sold 8 cakes in total, then the total amount of money earned from selling those cakes is:  P80 x 8 = P640.  Now, if the baker buys 40 cakes at a price lower than what she sells them for (P40 per cake), then the total amount of money saved is: P40 x 40 = P1600. So, the difference between the amount earned and the amount saved is: P1600 - P640 = P960.
Response:  The friend bought 137 pieces of cake from the baker. If the baker made 169 cakes in total, then there are 32 additional cakes that were not sold to the friend (169 - 137 = 32). So, the number of cakes left with the baker is 32.
Response:  The baker has already made 173 cakes and bought 103 new ones. So, the total number of cakes he/she has is: 173 + 103 = 276 cakes. However, there are also 86 cakes that have been sold, so the remaining number of cakes with the baker is: 276 - 86 = 190 cakes. Therefore, the baker still has 190 cakes left.
Response:  If Baker bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 of them, then he has 78 remaining (167 - 89 = 78). Now, if he already had 99 cakes before buying any new ones, then he now has a total of 99 + 78 = 177 cakes in his inventory. So, Baker has 177 more cakes than what he initially had.
Response:  The baker made 8 cakes and bought 139 new cakes. So, the total number of cakes he has is 8 + 139 = 147 cakes. Then, he sold 145 cakes. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he bought and the number of cakes he sold is 147 - 145 = 2 cakes.  So, the baker bought 2 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 62 cakes and then sold them for $144. This means that each cake was sold for $144 / 62 = $2.30 per cake. Now, the baker made additional 149 cakes after making 62 cakes. So, the total number of cakes he made is 62 + 149 = 211 cakes. Since he sold 144 cakes, there are 211 - 144 = 67 cakes left with him. Therefore, the baker has 67 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 81 cakes initially and then made another 92 cakes after that. So, in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes. Now, out of these 173 cakes, he sold 46 to someone else. This means that the number of cakes left with the baker is 173 - 46 = 127 cakes. Therefore, the baker made more cakes than the ones he bought.
Response:  We know that the total number of pastries sold is 108 + 44 = 152. Since the baker has 61 pastries left after selling 108, we can deduce that he had initially 61 - 108 = -47 pastries. So, there are 47 more pastries available with the baker than what was sold. Therefore, the answer is 47.
Response:  The baker has sold 104 cakes and 29 pastries in total. To find out how many pastries the baker made, we can divide the number of pastries he sold (29) by the number of cakes he sold (104): 29 / 104 = 0.278. So, the baker made approximately 27.8 pastries.
Response:  If Baker sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, then he earned P102 x ₱6 = P612 from selling cakes and P94 x ₱7 = P676 from selling pastries.  Now, to find out how much more money he earned from selling cakes than from selling pastries, we need to subtract the amount he earned from selling pastries from the total amount he earned: P612 - P676 = ₱36. So, for every additional cake that Baker sold beyond 102, he earned an extra ₱36 in profit.
Response:  The baker made 134 pastries and sold them for $140. This means that each pastry cost $140 / 134 = $105 per piece. Now, let's calculate how many more pastries the baker sold compared to the number of cakes he sold. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cakes (11) from the total number of items sold (140 + 92). So, the difference is: 140 + 92 - 11 = 243 pieces. Therefore, the baker sold 243 more pastries than cakes.
"Response:  The baker sold 8 pieces of pastry and 97 pieces of cakes for a total amount of Php 153. If we assume that each piece of pastry costs Php x, then the cost of 1 piec...
A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from selling product A is $20 per unit, while the profit from selling product B is $30 per unit. If the company sells 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B in a day, how much revenue will it generate in a day?
A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from selling product A is $20 per unit, while the profit from selling product B is $30 per unit. If the company sells 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B in a day, how much revenue will it generate in a day?  Based on the information provided, the daily revenue of the company can be calculated as follows: Daily Revenue = (Product A Units Sold x Profit Per Unit) + (Product B Units Sold x Profit Per Unit) In this case, the daily revenue would be: Daily Revenue = (60 x $20) + (40 x $30) = $1200 + $1200 = $2400 Therefore, the company will generate $2400 in revenue per day."
"Response:  The baker sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes for a total of PHP 1,092 (PHP 154 x PHP 7 = PHP 1,092). If we assume that each cake costs PHP 114 and each pastry costs PHP 43, then the cost of 10 more pastries would be:

Cost of 10 additional pastries = Cost of 1 pastry x Number of additional pastries = PHP 43 x 10 = PHP 430

Therefore, if the baker sells 10 more pastries than before, the new total amount earned will be:

New Total Amount Earned = Old Total Amount Earned + Cost of Additional Pastries = PHP 1,092 + PHP 430 = PHP 1,522

So, if the baker sells 10 more pastries than before, he/she will earn an additional PHP 430."
Response:  If there are 22 Nintendo games and each game has 140 levels, then we need to buy how many games to have 3080 levels (22 x 140 = 3080). So, we need to buy 7 Nintendo games (3080 / 22 = 7) to have all the levels available in total.
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she gives away 64 of them, then the number of games left with her is:  106 - 64 = 42. So, there are 42 Nintendo games left with Kelly after she gives away 64 of them.
Response:  If Kelly has 91 Nintendo games and she adds one more game to her collection, then she now has 92 games in total. So, the number of games that Kelly played first is 91 - 92 = -1. Therefore, Kelly did not play any of those games first.
"Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and she needs to have 12 more Nintendo games to equal the number of Sony games she has (which is 70), then we can calculate it as follows:

Number of Nintendo games needed = Total number of Sony games / Number of Sony games per Nintendo game
= 70 / 6 (since each Sony game represents 12 Nintendo games)
= 11.67
So, Kelly needs to give away approximately 12 Nintendo games to have an equal number of Sony games."
Response:  If Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to have 31 Sony games, we need to find out how many Sony games she needs to give away from her total of 132 Sony games. To do this, we can divide the number of Sony games she wants by the number of Sony games she currently has: Number of Sony games needed = (Desired number of Sony games) / (Current number of Sony games) = (31) / (132) = 0.23 or approximately 23% So, Kelly needs to give away about 23% of her Sony games in order to achieve her goal of having 31 Sony games.
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and she gave away 31 of them, then she has 80 - 31 = 49 remaining games left. To have 6 new games, she needs to give away 6 / 49 = 1/8 of her remaining games, or 12.5%. So, Kelly needs to give away 12.5% of her remaining games, which is 6 games.
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks and he wants to make a tower with them, then each block will be used once. So, if there are 38 blocks already stacked, that means Randy can make a tower of 14 blocks (52 - 38 = 14).
Response:  If Randy has 97 blocks and he uses x number of blocks to make one tower, then the total number of blocks used by Randy for all his towers would be equal to 97x. Since there are 72 blocks in each tower that Randy makes, we can find out how many towers Randy made by dividing the total number of blocks used by him by the number of blocks in each tower:  Total Number of Towers = Total Number of Blocks Used / Number of Blocks in Each Tower  Therefore, if Randy has 97 blocks and he uses them to make towers with 72 blocks each, then he will have made 97/72 = 13 towers.
Response:  If Randy has 79 blocks and he uses 14 of them to make a tower, then he has 65 blocks left (79 - 14 = 65).  If he uses 11 of these remaining blocks to make another tower, then he has 54 blocks left (65 - 11 = 54). So there are 54 blocks left after making both towers.
Response:  If Randy has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a wall, then he has 58 - 27 = 31 blocks left.  If he uses all 31 blocks to build a house, then he has no blocks left. So, the number of blocks used by Randy to build the wall and the house is 0.
Response:  If Randy has 37 blocks and he uses 33 of them to build a tower, then he has 4 blocks left over.  Now, if he uses all 4 blocks to build a house, he will have no blocks left over. So, the number of blocks used by Randy to build a house is equal to 4.
Response:  If Randy used 86 blocks to build a wall and needed 79 blocks to make one row of the wall, then he would need more than 79 blocks to build an entire wall. Therefore, the number of blocks used by Randy in building a house is greater than the number of blocks used in building a wall. So, the answer is (A) More than 79 blocks.
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks and he wants to make one tower with those blocks, then we can assume that each block will be used once to build the tower. So, if Randy has 36 blocks, it means that he can build 36 / 1 = 36 towers. Now, let's calculate how many blocks are needed for each tower. Since there are 59 blocks in total, each tower needs 59 / 36 = 1.62 blocks. Therefore, Randy needs 36 x 1.62 = 58.48 blocks to build all the towers he wants.
Response:  If Randy used 95 blocks to build a house and he used 20 blocks to build a wall around it, then he has 75 blocks left over (95 - 20 = 75).  Now, if he uses 50 blocks to build another wall around the first one, he will have 25 blocks left over (75 - 50 = 25). So, Randy used more blocks to build the second wall than he did to build the first house.
Response:  If Randy has 90 blocks and he uses 89 blocks to build a house, then he has 1 block left over.  If he uses 63 blocks to build a tower, then he needs 27 blocks more than he used for the house (since 63 - 89 = 27). So, Randy used 27 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house.
"Response:  If you have not read any of the books in the series ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan"" as of May 20th, and you have read at least 5 books from the series, then the number of books you have read from the series is 5 - x, where x is the number of books you have not read yet. So, the answer is 5 - x."
"Response:  If there are 13 books in the series that have been read and not all of them have been read yet (i.e., 8 books remain), then we can calculate the number of unread books as follows:

Unread Books = Number of Read Books - Number of Books Read
= 13 - 8
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 books left to be read in the series."
Response:  If there are 12 books and you need to read all of them, then you will have to spend 12 x 4 = 48 hours reading.  Similarly, if there are 56 movies and you want to watch all of them, then you will have to spend 56 x 3 = 168 hours watching. So in total, you will have to spend 48 + 168 = 216 hours.
Response:  If there are 19 books and you have read 7 of them, that means you still have 12 unread books left.  Similarly, if there are 7 movies and you have watched 3 of them, that means you still have 4 movies left to watch. So, in total, you need to watch 4 more movies.
Response:  If there are 19 books and you read 13 of them, that means you have not read 6 books yet. Similarly, if there are 13 movies and you watched 14 of them, that means you have not watched 1 movie yet. So, in total, you have not consumed 7 things (6 books + 1 movie). Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response:  Firstly, there are 19 books in the series ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan"" and 61 movies in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". Therefore, if you have read all 19 books and watched all 61 movies, that would be a total of 80 (19 + 61). So, the answer is 80."
Response:  If there are 13 books and you have read more than half of them (which is 6), then the number of books you have read is 6.  Similarly, if there are 12 movies and you have watched more than half of them (which is 7), then the number of movies you have watched is 7.  So, in this case, the number of books you have read is greater than the number of movies you have watched, which is 6 > 7.
Response:  If you read 7 books and watched 21 movies, that means you have a total of 28 (7 + 21).  However, if there are more movies than books, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books. So in this case, the answer would be 21.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the Balibalo series for elementary school students. If we need to read 14 different books from the Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan series, then we will need to supplement these with an additional 6 books. Therefore, the total number of books needed to be read is 8 + 6 = 14.
Response:  If there are 62 books and you have read 4 of them, then you still have 58 unread books left.  If there are 19 movies and you have watched 34 of them, then you still have 15 unwatched movies left. So, in total, you need to read 58 books and watch 15 movies.
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies, that means you have completed 7 + 4 = 11 tasks in total. So, there are still 5 more tasks to complete (i.e., 11 - 7 = 4). Therefore, you need to watch 4 more movies.
"Response:  If there are 11 books and 40 movies in the series ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan,"" then the number of books is greater than the number of movies.  To determine how many more books there are than movies, we can divide the number of books by 2 (since each book represents two episodes). So, if there are 11 books, that means there are 11 x 2 = 22 episodes in total. Now, let's compare this to the number of movies. Since there are 40 movies, that means each movie represents approximately half an episode (since there are 40 / 2 = 20 episodes per movie). Therefore, if there are 22 episodes in total, then there are 22 - 20 = 2 more episodes than movies in the series."
"Response:  Firstly, there are 13 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"" and 63 movies in the series ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan"". Therefore, if we divide the number of movies by the number of books, we get:  Number of movies per book = 63 / 13 = 5. So, for every one book in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series, there are approximately 5 movies in the ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan"" series."
"Response:  If you read 14 books and watched 19 movies in the series ""Baliw na Maliliit na Paaralan,"" then we can say that you have a total of 33 (14 + 19) items from the two media forms. Now, if you had to choose between reading more books or watching more movies, which would you prefer?  Based on your previous response, it seems like you preferred reading more books than watching movies. So, I will assume that you would rather read more books than watch more movies. Therefore, the answer is 14."
Response:  If you watched 19 movies and read 16 books, that means you have seen more movies than books.  So, if you had to choose between watching another movie or reading another book, which one would you prefer?  Based on your preference, I will give you a numerical answer of 19-16 = 3.
Response:  If Dave won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy games, then he must have had X number of tickets left after buying the games. Since there are 2 tickets remaining, we can write an equation as follows:  X = 7 - 2  Now, let's solve for X:  X = 7 - 2  X = 5  Therefore, Dave has 5 tickets left after buying the games.
Response:  If Dave won 12 tickets and he has 14 remaining tickets, then we can calculate how many tickets he won in total as follows:  Total number of tickets won = Number of tickets won x Remaining tickets  Total number of tickets won = 12 x 14  Total number of tickets won = 168  Therefore, Dave won 168 tickets at the arcade.
Response:  If Dave won 18 tickets and he used 5 of them to buy games and 11 of them to buy clothes, then we can say that he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left. So, the number of tickets left with Dave is 13.
Response:  If Dave won $19 in tickets and he used $12 to buy large stuff and $7 to buy small items, then we can calculate how much each ticket cost him for buying these items. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of money he spent ( $12 + $7 = $19) by the number of tickets he used ($19 / 12 = $1.58). So, each ticket cost Dave approximately $1.58 to buy the items he mentioned.
Response:  If Dave won 13 tickets and he used 8 of them to buy games, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5).  Now, if he used 18 tickets to buy clothes, that means he has 0 tickets left (5 - 18 = 0). So, Dave did not have enough money to buy both games and clothes.
Response:  If Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left.  Now, if he uses 10 of these tickets to buy games, that means he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. So, the answer is 2 tickets.
Response:  If Haley planted 14 trees in her backyard and after the storm, 9 of them died, then we can calculate the number of surviving trees as follows:  Number of surviving trees = Total number of trees - Number of dead trees Surviving trees = 14 - 9 = 5 So, there were 5 surviving trees out of the 14 trees that Haley planted in her backyard.
Response:  We know that there are 13 coconuts in total and after the storm, 6 of them were killed. So, if we want to find out how many coconuts survived the storm, we can use the following formula: Surviving Coconuts = Total Coconuts - Dead Coconuts Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Surviving Coconuts = 13 - 6 = 7 Therefore, 7 coconuts survived the storm.
Response:  At first, there were 20 fruits in Hayley's basket. After the storm, only 4 fruits remained. So, the number of fruits that died during the storm is 16 (20 - 4).
Response:  If there were initially 10 trees in Haley's backyard before the storm and after the storm, 5 of them died, then the number of trees left would be 10 - 5 = 5.  So, if 12 new trees grew during that time period, the total number of trees in Haley's backyard now would be 5 + 12 = 17.
Response:  Initially, Hayley had planted 9 trees in her backyard. After the storm, 4 of them died. Then she planted another 5 trees. So, the total number of trees left after the storm and after replanting is: 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 trees remaining in Hayley's backyard.
Response:  If one bag of rice weighs 2 pounds and there are 12 bags of rice in front of Hayley's house that were destroyed by the storm, then the total weight of the rice that was destroyed is:  12 x 2 = 24 pounds.
Response:  If one tree fell in front of Haley's house and killed her, and there were 13 trees that fell behind her house, then we can assume that the total number of trees that fell during the storm was 13 + 1 = 14. Since Haley died due to the falling tree, let's say she died because of the first tree that fell (the one in front of her house). So, if 3 trees fell before the first tree that hit Haley's house, then the total number of trees that fell before the first tree that hit Haley's house would be 3. Therefore, the ratio of trees that fell near Haley's house to those that did not is 14:3 or 4:1.
Response:  If one tree fell in front of Haley's house and killed 2 people, then there were 9 trees that did not fall and saved lives (11 - 2 = 9). So, if more trees fell than people died, then more lives were saved than people who died.
Response:  If there are 66 sacks of rice and each sack contains 28 kilograms, then we can calculate the total number of kilograms as follows:  Total number of kilograms = Number of sacks x Weight per sack  Total number of kilograms = 66 x 28 kg/sack  Total number of kilograms = 1904 kg
"Response:  If there are 8 sacks of rice per day and they need to collect 24 sacks in total, then we can calculate how many days it will take them to collect all the sacks as follows:

Number of days = Total number of sacks / Number of sacks per day
= 24 / 8
= 3 days

Therefore, it will take them 3 days to collect all 24 sacks of rice."
Response:  If it takes him 4 days to complete his work and he works for 8 hours a day, then he has worked for a total of 32 hours (4 days x 8 hours/day). Since there are 56 baskets of rice, if he works for 32 hours, then he can finish one basket every hour. So, the number of baskets he can finish in one day is 56 / 32 = 1.75 baskets per day.
Response:  If they have been anointing themselves for 38 days and each day has 42 kahels, then the total number of kahels used is: 38 x 42 = 1576 kahels. Now, if they continue to anoint themselves for another 49 days, the total number of kahels used will be: 1576 + (49 x 42) = 2067 kahels. So, there will be 49 more kahels used after 49 days of continued anointment.
Response:  If they have 66 sacks of rice after one day and each sack has 25 kilograms, then they will have a total of 1,650 kilograms (66 x 25 = 1,650) after one day. To find out how many kilograms they will have after 87 days, we can multiply the number of days by the initial amount: 1,650 x 87 = 143,500 kilograms. Therefore, there will be 143,500 kilograms of rice left for them to eat after 87 days.
Response:  If they visit every day and each trip takes 8 sacks of rice, then they will have visited for how many days?  If it takes 8 sacks per day, then the number of sacks they can carry = Total amount of rice / Number of trips per day. So if there are 35 kahels in each sack, then the total amount of rice they can carry = 35 x 8 = 280 kahels. Therefore, the number of kahels they can collect in one day = Total amount of rice / Number of trips per day = 280/8 = 35 kahels per day.
"Response:  If there are 16 sacks of rice and each sack contains 57 kernels, then we have:

Number of kernels = Number of sacks x Number of kernels per sack
= 16 x 57
= 928 kernels

Now, to find out how many days it will take to collect 80 sacks of rice, we can divide the total number of kernels by the number of kernels collected per day:

Days required = Total number of kernels / Number of kernels collected per day
= 928 kernels / 16 (since each sack contains 57 kernels)
= 58 days

Therefore, it will take approximately 58 days to collect 80 sacks of rice if each sack contains 57 kernels."
Response:  If there are 67 sacks of rice and each sack contains 12 kilograms, then the total weight of all the sacks is:  67 x 12 = 804 kilograms. Now, if they have been anointing for 35 sacks of rice, then the number of kilograms of anointing oil used can be calculated as follows: Number of kilograms of anointing oil used = Total weight of all sacks of rice x Percentage of anointing oil used / 100  Number of kilograms of anointing oil used = 804 kg x (35/67) / 100 = 29.6 kilograms. Therefore, the answer to the question is 29.6 kilograms.
Response:  The number of baskets that will be filled after 51 days of sunshine can be calculated as follows:  Day 1 to 50: 74 + (71 x 50) = 3850  Day 51: 74 + (71 x 1) = 75 Total number of baskets = 3850 + 75 = 3925 Therefore, there will be 3925 baskets after 51 days of sunshine.
Response:  If they had 76 kilograms of rice per day and consumed 64 kilograms, then they have 12 kilograms left over (76 - 64 = 12). Now, if each sack contains 50 kilograms, then they have 3 sacks left over (12 / 50 = 3). So, the number of sacks they have left is 3.
Response:  The number of baskets that will have enough rice after 26 days of cooking can be calculated as follows:  Initially, there are 28 baskets with enough rice and 52 baskets without enough rice, for a total of 80 baskets. After 26 days, the number of baskets with enough rice will increase by 26/2 = 13 baskets. Therefore, the final number of baskets with enough rice will be 80 + 13 = 93 baskets.
Response:  We know that there are 82 bags of masaklap and 61 bags of non-masaklap with an average weight of 40 kg per bag. After 25 days, we will have:  Total number of bags after 25 days = Number of bags x Time (in days) / 24 hours/day  Total number of bags after 25 days = 82 x 25 / 24 = 93 bags So, there will be 93 bags of masaklap and 61 bags of non-masaklap left after 25 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 31 baskets of fully ripe coconuts and 24 baskets of unripe coconuts after 45 days of pollination. To find out how many baskets of unripe coconuts will become ripe after another 45 days, we can use the following formula: Number of baskets of ripe coconuts = Total number of baskets x Percentage of ripening  In this case, the total number of baskets is 31 + 24 = 55 baskets. The percentage of ripening is given as 60%. So, to find out how many baskets of unripe coconuts will become ripe after another 45 days, we can multiply the total number of baskets by the percentage of ripening: Number of baskets of ripe coconuts = 55 x 60% = 33 baskets Therefore, after another 45 days, there will be 33 baskets of ripe coconuts in addition to the 31 baskets already ripe.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 44 baskets of ripe bananas and 25 baskets of unripe bananas. We also know that each basket contains 10 bananas. So, altogether, there are 440 bananas (44 x 10) of ripe bananas and 250 bananas (25 x 10) of unripe bananas. Now, to find out how many more ripe bananas there are than unripe bananas, we need to subtract the number of unripe bananas from the total number of bananas. Therefore, the difference between the number of ripe bananas and unripe bananas is 440 - 250 = 190 bananas. So, there are 190 more ripe bananas than unripe bananas in one day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 120 sacks of rice (5 x 24 = 120). Now, let's calculate how many sacks of uncooked rice are left after cooking 5 sacks of rice. If each sack contains 20 kilograms of rice, then 5 sacks of rice would be equal to 5 x 20 = 100 kilograms of uncooked rice. So, if they have already cooked 5 sacks of rice, then they will have 120 - 100 = 20 kilograms of uncooked rice remaining. Similarly, if they have not yet cooked any rice, then they will have 120 sacks of uncooked rice. Therefore, the number of sacks of uncooked rice that they have more than the amount needed for one day is 20 - 0 = 20.
Response:  If there are 54 shells and they take 18 shells per day to clean, then how many days will it take them to clean all of them?  To find out, we can divide 54 by 18: 54 / 18 = 3.  So, it will take them 3 days to clean all of the shells.
Response:  If they visited the place every day for 14 days and collected 56 baskets of rice each time, then the total number of baskets of rice they collected during those 14 days would be: 56 x 14 = 792 baskets of rice.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 baskets of unripe bananas and 5 baskets of ripe bananas after 73 days of ripening. So, the total number of bananas = 25 + 5 = 30. Now, let's calculate the average number of bananas per day for the 73 days: Total no. of bananas / No. of days = 30 / 73 = 0.426 or approximately 0.43 bananas per day. Therefore, the number of bananas the monkey will have after 73 days of collecting them = 0.43 x 73 = 31.9 bananas.
"Response:  If there are currently 65 baskets of unsorted rice and 46 baskets of sorted rice after 1 day, then the total number of baskets of rice will increase by 6 times the number of days that have passed (since each day adds 6 new baskets of unsorted rice). So, if it takes 6 days to sort all the rice, then the total number of baskets of rice will be:  
Total number of baskets = Number of baskets after 1 day x 6 = 6 x 65 = 390 baskets  Therefore, there will be 390 baskets of rice after 6 days of sorting."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 41 baskets of unripe bananas and 86 baskets of ripe bananas. So, the total number of bananas = 41 + 86 = 127 bananas. Now, let's find out how many bananas have enough skin to peel. According to the question, among the 127 bananas, 50 have enough skin to peel. Therefore, the number of bananas with enough skin to peel = 50.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 71 baskets of unripe bananas and 60 baskets of ripe bananas. So, the total number of bananas = 71 + 60 = 131 bananas. Now, let's find out how many more unripe bananas there are than ripe bananas. The difference between the two quantities = Number of unripe bananas - Number of ripe bananas = 131 - 60 = 71 bananas. Therefore, there are 71 more unripe bananas than ripe bananas per day.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 talampaks and its width is 11 talampaks. To find out how long Jesse's room is compared to its width, we can use the formula: Length = Width x Number of Talampaks. In this case, the length of Jesse's room is 12 x 11 = 132 talampaks. So, Jesse's room is 132 talampaks longer than its width.
Response:  First, we need to convert the length of the room from meters to square meters. According to the question, the length of the room is 7 talampakans or 28 meters. Therefore, the area of the room in square meters can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 28 x 10 = 280 square meters Now, we are asked to find out how many square feet the carpet needs to cover. We know that there are 0.139 square meters in one square foot, so we can calculate the number of square feet needed as follows: Number of square feet = Area in square meters / 0.139 = 280 / 0.139 = approximately 2,065 square feet
Response:  If Jesse has 7 large rugs that are each 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, then he has a total of 7 x 3 = 21 square feet of rug area. Since he needs a carpet that covers 14 square feet, we can divide the total area of the rugs by 14 to find out how many rugs he will need. So, 21 / 14 = 1 1/2 rugs. Therefore, Jesse will need 1 1/2 rugs to cover his room.
Response:  The total area of the room is given as 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. To cover the entire room with an alpombra that costs $2 per square foot, we need to calculate:  $2 x 165 = $330 Therefore, Jesse needs to pay $330 for the alpombra to cover the entire room.
Response:  The room of Jesse is 20 square meters long and 12 square meters wide. If each tile has an area of 4 square feet, then we need to calculate how many tiles are needed to cover the entire room. To do this, we can use the formula Area = Length x Width, where Length and Width are the dimensions of the room in meters. So, if the length of the room is 20 meters and the width is 12 meters, then the area of the room is: Area = 20 x 12 = 240 square meters Now, since there are 4 square feet in one meter squared, we can convert the area of the room from square meters to square feet as follows: Area (in sq ft) = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet Therefore, to cover the entire room with tiles that have an area of 4 square feet each, Jesse will need: Number of tiles = Area of room / Area per tile = 60 / 4 = 15 tiles.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are needed for each silid. Since there are 19 silids with an average length of 3 feet and an average width of 4 feet, the total area of each silid is: Area = Length x Width = 3 ft x 4 ft = 12 sq ft.  Next, we need to calculate the total area of all 19 silids: Total Area = 19 x 12 sq ft = 216 sq ft.  Now, since Jesse has 18 silids with an average length of 3 feet and an average width of 4 feet, the total area of all 18 silids is: Total Area = 18 x 12 sq ft = 216 sq ft (the same as before).  Finally, we multiply the total area of all the silids by the number of silids that Jesse needs to cover: Number of Silids x Total Area per Silid = 18 x 216 sq ft = 3768 sq ft. Therefore, Jesse needs 3768 square feet of carpet to cover all his silids.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 19 talampakans and its width is 20 talampakans. To find out how long Jesse's room is compared to its width, we can use the formula: Length = Width x Number of Talampakans. In this case, the length of Jesse's room is equal to 20 times 19, or 380 talampakans. So, Jesse's room is approximately 380 talampakans long.
"Response:  If Jesse needs a 10 square feet carpet for his room and his room measures 5 talampaks wide, then we can calculate the length of the carpet needed as follows:
Length = Width x Area Required / Total Area of Room
= 5 x 10 / 50 (since the total area of the room is 50 square feet)
= 25 feet
Therefore, Jesse needs a carpet that is 25 feet long to cover his entire room."
"Response:  If Jesse needs a 10 square feet carpet for his room and his room measures 2 meters wide x 3 meters long = 6 square meters (not including corners), then we can calculate how much of the carpet he will need as follows:

Total area of the room = Length x Width = 6 square meters
Required area of the carpet = Total area of the room / Size of each square foot = 6 square meters / 10 square feet = 0.6 square meters or approximately 0.84 square yards
Therefore, Jesse will need approximately 0.84 square yards of carpet to cover his entire room."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet Jesse has. According to the question, he has 18 square feet of carpet. Next, we need to determine how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover his entire room. To do this, we can use the formula: Total area = Length x Width (in square feet). Since Jesse's room is 4 meters long and 20 meters wide, its total area is: Total Area = 4 m x 20 m = 80 square meters. Now, we divide the total area by the area of one square meter to get the number of square meters needed for the whole room: Number of square meters needed = 80 sqm / 10 sqm/m2 = 8 squares. Finally, since each square foot is equal to 0.11 square meters, we convert the number of square meters to square feet: Number of square feet needed = 8 sqm x 0.11 sqft/sqm = 0.88 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs approximately 0.88 square feet of additional carpet to cover his entire room.
Response:  The revenue of each T-shirt is $23, and they sell during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, their total revenue will be $23 x number of shirts sold = $230. To find out how many shirts were sold, we can divide the total revenue by the revenue per shirt: Number of shirts sold = $230 / $23 = 10. So, they sold 10 T-shirts during the game.
Response:  The total amount earned from selling three T-shirts is given as $51. Since each game generates revenue of $17, we can calculate the cost price of each T-shirt as follows: Cost Price = Total Revenue / Number of T-shirts sold = $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt. Therefore, the cost price of each T-shirt is $17.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during the period of the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game is given as 95. Since they sell 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, we can find out how much money they earned from selling those T-shirts by dividing the total number of T-shirts sold by the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game:  So, the amount of money earned by Razorback from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game is $ 87 x 47 = $ 3,869.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during the Texas Tech game is given as 242. If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during the Texas Tech game is 242 - 115 = 127. So, the revenue generated by selling these T-shirts is $106 x 127 = $13,092.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during the Texas Tech game is given as 163. If they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the total number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during both games is 163 + 89 = 252 T-shirts.  Since each T-shirt costs $98, the total revenue earned by Razorback from selling all these T-shirts is 252 x $98 = $24,704.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold by Razorback during the Texas Tech game is given as 186. If they sold 172 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the revenue generated from selling T-shirts during that game can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Price of each T-shirt So, the revenue generated from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game is: Revenue = 172 x $ 78 = $ 13,056 Now, we need to find out how much money Razorback made from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game. To do this, we need to subtract the revenue generated from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas game from the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during both games: Money earned from Texas Tech game = Total amount of money earned - Revenue from Arkansas game So, the money earned from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game is: Money earned from Texas Tech game = $ 13,056 - $ 13,056 = $ 0 This means that Razorback did not make any money from selling T-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  The cost price of one T-shirt is $62 and that of one Jersey is $99. If they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 Jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, then their total revenue from these sales can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost Price of T-shirt + Number of Jerseys x Cost Price of Jersey Total Revenue = 183 x $62 + 31 x $99 Total Revenue = $11,543 + $3,039 Total Revenue = $14,582 So, the Razorbacks earned $14,582 in revenue from selling T-shirts and Jerseys during the game.
Response:  The cost price of each jersey is $165 and they sold 156 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, their total revenue from selling jerseys can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Jerseys Sold x Cost Price per Jersey Total Revenue = 156 x $165 Total Revenue = $25,940 Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $25,940 in revenue from selling jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $ 192 and that of one Jersey is $ 34. If they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 Jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game, then we can calculate the total revenue from T-shirts as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt = 157 x $ 192 = $ 28,640 Similarly, we can calculate the total revenue from Jerseys as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Jerseys x Cost per Jersey = 19 x $ 34 = $ 656 Now, let's find out the difference in price between T-shirts and Jerseys: Difference in Price = Total Revenue from T-shirts - Total Revenue from Jerseys = $ 28,640 - $ 656 = $ 27,984 Therefore, the cost of a T-shirt is $ 27,984 more than the cost of a Jersey.
Response:  The cost of each jersey is $232 and the cost of each t-shirt is $86. If they sold 43 jerseys and 254 t-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, then we can calculate the total revenue from jerseys as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Jerseys x Cost per Jersey = 43 x $232 = $9,716 Now, let's calculate the total revenue from t-shirts: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Cost per T-Shirt = 254 x $86 = $21,904 Therefore, the difference in price between jerseys and t-shirts is: Difference = Total Revenue from Jerseys - Total Revenue from T-Shirts = $9,716 - $21,904 = $12,188 So, the average price of a jersey is $12.188 higher than that of a t-shirt.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $ 51. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they offered a discount of $ 8 per T-shirt and sold 130 T-shirts. Therefore, their revenue from selling T-shirts can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Cost Price x Number of Shirts Sold = $ 51 x 130 = $ 6,530 So, the total revenue generated by Razorback for selling T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game was $ 6,530.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $ 201 and they sell for $ 217 during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. This means that their profit per unit is: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = $ 217 - $ 201 = $ 16 per unit. Now, let's calculate their total revenue from selling T-shirts: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts sold x Profit per unit = 14 T-shirts x $ 16 = $ 224. Therefore, their total revenue from selling T-shirts is $ 224.
Response:  The Arkansas Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $60 from selling T-shirts during an Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game. If they earn $10 per T-shirt sold, how many T-shirts did they sell?  To find out, we can divide the amount of money they earned ($60) by the amount they earn per T-shirt ($10):  $60 / $10 = 6 T-shirts  So, the Arkansas Razorback T-Shirt Shop sold 6 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  The total amount earned from selling 5 t-shirts is given as $215. If we divide this amount by the number of t-shirts sold (5), we get the average price per t-shirt:  $215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt.
Response:  The cost price of one T-shirt is $215 and that of one jersey is $5. So if they sold 20 T-shirts and 64 jerseys, their total revenue from these sales would be: Revenue = Number of items x Cost price per item = 20 x $215 + 64 x $5 = $9,300 + $3,240 = $12,540 Now we need to find out how much profit they made from selling these items. Profit = Revenue - Cost = $12,540 - ($9,300 + $3,240) = $4,060 Therefore, the Razorbacks made a profit of $4,060 from selling those 84 items during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  The cost price of one Razorback jersey is $76 and that of a T-shirt is $204. If they sold 158 T-shirts and 2 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, their total revenue from sales can be calculated as follows: Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost price per T-shirt + Number of Jerseys x Cost price per Jersey Total revenue = 158 x $204 + 2 x $76 Total revenue = $31,920 Now, we need to find out how much they earned from each jersey sale. To do this, divide the total revenue by the number of jerseys sold: Earnings per jersey = Total revenue / Number of jerseys sold Earnings per jersey = $31,920 / 2 Earnings per jersey = $15,960 So, the Razorbacks earned $15,960 from selling two jerseys during the game.
Response:  The cost of each T-shirt is $ 210 and that of each jersey is $ 240. If they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 jerseys during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, then we can calculate the total revenue from T-shirts as follows: Total Revenue from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt = 177 x $ 210 = $ 36,970  Similarly, we can calculate the total revenue from jerseys as follows: Total Revenue from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Cost per Jersey = 23 x $ 240 = $ 5,420  Therefore, the difference in price between T-shirts and jerseys is: Difference in Price = Total Revenue from T-shirts - Total Revenue from Jerseys = $ 36,970 - $ 5,420 = $ 31,550
Response:  The cost of each jersey is $ 115 and that of each T-shirt is $ 25. If they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, then we can calculate the total amount earned from selling these items as follows: Total earnings from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 113 x $ 25 = $ 2,775 Total earnings from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Price per Jersey = 78 x $ 115 = $ 9,050 Now, to find out how much more money was earned from selling jerseys than T-shirts, we need to subtract the total earnings from T-shirts from the total earnings from Jerseys: Difference = Total earnings from Jerseys - Total earnings from T-shirts = $ 9,050 - $ 2,775 = $ 6,275 Therefore, the Razorbacks earned $ 6,275 more from selling jerseys than T-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  The group of friends has 5 sets of tables and each set contains 10 plates. So, in total, they have 5 x 10 = 50 plates. If they are having a party in their backyard and there are more than enough plates for everyone to share equally, then the number of plates per person is 50 / (number of people attending the party). Since we don't know how many people will attend the party, let's assume that it's a random variable. We can use probability theory to find out the expected value of the number of plates per person. According to the question, the group of friends wants to make sure that everyone gets an equal amount of food, so they want to distribute the 50 plates fairly among all the guests. One way to do this is to divide the 50 plates into as many groups as there are guests, such that each guest receives one plate from each group. This means that each group of friends will receive 50/n plates, where n is the number of guests attending the party. Now, we need to calculate the expected value of the number of plates per person. To do this, we need to sum up all possible values of the number of plates per person and multiply them by their probabilities. There are n! ways to arrange n objects (in this case, plates) if no object is repeated. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute 50 plates among n guests is C(50, n), which represents the number of combinations of sizes of a subset of {1, 2,..., 50} that sums to n. Using the formula for the binomial distribution, we can express the probability mass function of the number of plates per person as follows: P(x) = C(50, n) / n! For example, if there are 10 guests attending the party, the number of ways to distribute 50 plates is C(50, 10) = 450. The probability of getting exactly 6 plates per person is P(6) = 450 / 10! = 0.0377. Similarly, the probability of getting exactly 7 plates per person is P(7) = 4
Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables with different number of chairs in each set. So, let's assume that the total number of chairs in both sets is equal to $x$. Since there are 12 chairs in the backyard, we can write an equation as follows:  x + (2 \* 6) = 12 where $(2 \* 6)$ represents the number of chairs in each set. Solving for $x$, we get: $x = 7$ Therefore, there are 7 chairs in each set.
Response:  We know that there are 9 upuan in total (bakuran). Each set of mesas has 3 upuan each. So, if we divide the total number of upuan by the number of sets of mesas, we get: Number of sets of mesas = Total number of upuan / Number of upuan per set  In this case, Number of sets of mesas = 9 / 3 = 3 sets of mesas. Therefore, there are 3 sets of mesas with 3 upuan each in the backyard.
Response:  We know that there are 11 sets of chairs and each set has 13 chairs. So, we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows:  Total number of chairs = Number of sets x Number of chairs per set  Total number of chairs = 11 x 13  Total number of chairs = 143 chairs. Therefore, there are 143 chairs in the backyard.
Response:  If there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60 chairs. Now, if 11 people are sitting on the chairs, but not all of them are occupying an equal number of chairs, then we need to find out how many chairs are left unoccupied. To do this, let's divide the total number of chairs (60) by the number of people sitting on them (11). So, the number of chairs that are left unoccupied is 60 / 11 = 5 chairs. Therefore, 5 chairs are left unoccupied.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many sets of tables and chairs are needed for the party. According to the question, there will be 12 sets of tables and chairs in total. Therefore, the number of sets is 12. Next, we need to calculate the number of chairs per set. Based on the information provided, each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs needed is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The host wants to know how many additional chairs they have. According to the question, they have 6 extra chairs. Therefore, the final answer is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and chairs (mesas) in total, each set containing 3 pieces. If there were 14 guests attending the party, we would need to buy additional chairs for them, which means we would need an additional 14 / 3 = 4 more chairs. So, in total, we would need 4 + 3 = 7 more chairs.
Response:  The number of sets of tables is given as 9. Each set has 4 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs = Number of sets x Number of chairs per set = 9 x 4 = 36 chairs. Since there are 14 people in the group, each person will have to share 2 chairs (since they cannot sit on just one chair). So, the number of chairs each person can use = Total number of chairs / Number of people in the group = 36 / 14 = 2.5 chairs per person.
Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in 5 weeks, then he earned $92 per week ($460 / 5 weeks).
"Response:  If Lewis earned $ 1216 in one year and he earns $ 16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to save that amount as follows:

$ 1216 / $ 16 = 78 weeks

So, it took Lewis 78 weeks or approximately 19 months to save $ 1216 at an income of $ 16 per week."
Response:  If he earns $ 21 every week for 216 weeks, his total income is:  $ 21 x 216 = $ 4,396.  To find out how much he has at the end of the period, we subtract the amount he needs to pay in taxes: $ 4,396 - $ 702 = $ 3,694. So, he has $ 3,694 left after paying taxes.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis can earn per week if he works for 223 weeks in a year. According to the problem, Lewis earns $ 1357 per week. Therefore, his total income for one year would be:  Total Income = Number of Weeks x Weekly Income  Total Income = 223 x $ 1357  Total Income = $ 304,913  Now, let's find out how much Lewis can earn over a period of 73 years. To do this, we will divide his total income by the number of years he will work:  Total Income / Number of Years Worked = Amount Earned Over 73 Years  Total Income / 73 = $ 416,877  So, Lewis can earn approximately $ 416,877 over 73 years if he works for 223 weeks per year and earns $ 1357 per week.
Response:  If he works OT every day and earns $ 28 per day for 1091 days of regular work, then his total income from regular work is:  $ 28 x 1091 = $ 297,680.  And if he also earns $ 939 per day for OT, then his total income from OT is:  $ 939 x 1091 = $ 102,549. So, in total, he earns:  $ 297,680 + $ 102,549 = $ 399,229 per year.
Response:  If he earns $ 403 per week for 233 weeks of work, his total income would be:  Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = $ 403 x 233 = $ 93,530. Now, if he needs to pay $ 49 per week as taxes, his remaining income after taxes would be: Remaining Income = Total Income - Taxes = $ 93,530 - $ 49 = $ 89,671. So, during the period of unemployment, he will have earned approximately $ 89,671.
Response:  If he earns $ 368 per week for 1359 weeks, then his total income is:  Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = $ 368 x 1359 = $ 472,072. Now, if he needs to pay an additional $ 388 as allowance per week for 1359 weeks, then his total expense would be: Total Expense = Allowance x Number of Weeks = $ 388 x 1359 = $ 516,778. So, the difference between his total income and total expenses is: Difference = Total Income - Total Expense = $ 472,072 - $ 516,778 = $ -44,706. Therefore, he will have a deficit of $ 44,706 during the period of 1359 weeks.
Response:  If he earns $ 491 every week for 1181 weeks, then his total income is:  Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = $ 491 x 1181 = $ 573,091  Now, if he needs to pay $ 216 each week at the end of the period, we can calculate how much money he has left after making the payment: Money Left After Payment = Total Income - Weekly Payment = $ 573,091 - $ 216 = $ 551,975 So, the amount of money that Lewis has left after paying $ 216 each week for 1181 weeks is $ 551,975.
Response:  If Lewis earned $133 in one week, then he earned $133 x 7 = $901 per month. So, his monthly income is $901.
"Response:  If Lewis makes $2 per day for 30 days, his total earnings would be:
$2 x 30 = $60
So, if he made $178 in a month that has 30 days, the number of months it took him to save that amount is:
$178 / $60 = 3 months
Therefore, the answer is 3 months."
Response:  If the height of water is 10 times that of Dean and he is standing in an area with a perimeter of 9 talampaks, then we can calculate how deep the water is compared to Dean's height as follows:  Water depth = Height of water x Perimeter of area where Dean is standing = 10 x 9 = 90 meters Deep water = Height of Dean / Depth of water = 5 meters So, the water is 5 meters deeper than Dean's height.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the water level is twice as high as Dean's height. So if Dean's height is 8 feet less than Ron's height, then Ron's height must be 16 feet (since 8 + 8 = 16). Now, since the water level is twice as high as Dean's height, it means that the water level is also twice as high as Ron's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 2 x 16 = 32 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron is 12 feet tall and the water level is 5 times higher than him. So if Ron is at 12 feet height, then the water level will be 60 feet high (5 x 12 = 60). Now we need to find out how many meters this is. Since there are 3 feet in 1 meter, we can convert the height of the water level from feet to meters as follows: 60 feet / 3 = 20 meters. Therefore, the water level is 20 meters high above Ron's head.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of the water level is 15 times greater than the height of Dean. So, if Dean is 4 feet tall, then the height of the water level is 15 x 4 = 60 feet. Now, we are told that Ron is shorter than Dean by 13 inches. Therefore, the height of Ron is equal to the height of Dean minus 13 inches. So, the height of Ron is 4 - 13 = -9 inches. Since negative numbers indicate depth, the depth of the water is 9 inches.
Response:  We know that Ron is taller than Dean because he can see 16 times farther than Dean. So if Dean is 9 feet tall, then Ron must be at least 25 feet (16 x 9) above him. Therefore, Ron is at least 25 - 9 = 16 feet tall.
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 times taller than Dean, so if Dean is 6 meters tall, then Ron must be 90 meters tall (since 15 x 6 = 90).
Response:  If there are 34 books in total and we want to divide them equally among two bookshelves, then each bookshelf will have Books = 34 / 2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Bryan has 42 books in total and each bookshelf can hold 2 books, then we need to find out how many bookshelves Bryan has. We know that the number of bookshelves is equal to the total number of books divided by the capacity of each bookshelf. So, if Bryan has 42 books and each bookshelf can hold 2 books, then he must have:

$$ Number \ of \ bookshelves = Total \ number \ of \ books / Capacity \ of \ each \ bookshelf $$

Substituting the given values, we get:

$$ Number \ of \ bookshelves = 42 / 2 = 21 $$

So, Bryan has 21 bookshelves."
Response:  If Bryan has 27 books and each book takes up 1 shelf space, then he has 27 / 1 = 27 shelves in total.  If each shelf can hold 80 books, then the total number of books that Bryan has is 27 x 80 = 2160 books. So, the total value of his collection is 2160 x $5 = $10,800.
Response:  If Bryan has 9 books and each book takes up 2 slots in his bookshelves, then he can accommodate 9 x 2 = 18 books in total in all of his bookshelves.  Now, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up 1 slot in his bookshelves, then he can accommodate 46 / 1 = 46 magazines in total in all of his bookshelves. Therefore, the number of magazines that Bryan can accommodate is 46.
Response:  If there are 23 books in Bryan's library and each shelf has 7 slots, then there will be 23/7 = 3 books per shelf. Since there are 29 bookshelves, then there will be 3 x 29 = 87 books in total in Bryan's library. Now, if there are 61 magazines in Bryan's collection and he has one magazine for every 4 books, then there will be 61/4 = 15 magazines per shelf. Since there are 29 bookshelves, then there will be 15 x 29 = 405 magazines in total in Bryan's collection. Therefore, the answer to the question is 87 books and 405 magazines.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 bookshelves in total and each shelf has an equal number of books. So, we can assume that each bookshelf contains 28 books (since you mentioned the total number of books is 28). Now, to find out how many books are in each bookshelf, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of bookshelves. Therefore, the number of books in each bookshelf is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of books in each bookshelf = Total number of books / Number of bookshelves}} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of books in each bookshelf = 28 books / 7 bookshelves}} $$

Simplifying, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of books in each bookshelf = 4 books}} $$

Therefore, there are 4 books in each of the 7 bookshelves."
Response:  If there are 38 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books, then we can calculate the number of bookshelves as follows:  Number of bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per bookshelf = 38 / 2 = 19 bookshelves. Therefore, if he has X bookshelves, then the number of books he has is 19X.
Response:  If Carol bought 10 gifts for her 10 friends and each gift contains 2 small toys inside, then she needs to buy 2 x 10 = 20 small toys in total.  So, the answer is 20.
Response:  If Carol bought 3 packs of each with equal number of candies in each pack, then the total number of candies she bought would be:  Number of packs = 3 x 12 = 36 Packets per pack = 36 / 3 = 12 Candies per packet Total number of candies = 12 x 36 = 432
Response:  If Carol buys 7 packages of candy and each package contains 10 pieces of candy, then she has bought a total of 7 x 10 = 70 candies.  Now, if she wants to share these candies equally among her 3 friends, she will have to distribute them in equal shares. So, she will give 70 / 3 = 23 candies to each friend. Therefore, the number of candies that Carol has given to her 3 friends is 23 x 3 = 69 candies.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carol bought 6 packages of candy for her friends during the party. So, there are 6 x 14 = 84 candies in total that she bought. Then, after the party, she purchased additional 11 more pieces of candy, bringing the total number to 84 + 11 = 95 candies. Therefore, the number of friends who can be given candy from Carol is 95 / 6 = 15.
"Response:  If Carol wants to give each of her 9 friends an additional gift, and she bought each package containing 3 gifts for P100, then she spent a total of:
P100 x 3 = P300 for the first set of gifts
P300 x 9 = P2700 for the additional sets of gifts (since there are 9 friends)
So in total, Carol needs to spend:
P2700 + P300 = P3000
Therefore, the answer is P3000."
Response:  If Melissa gets an average of 12 points per game, then she has scored a total of 36 points in all the games she played. So, if she played x number of games, then the total number of points she scored is 36x.
Response:  If Melissa scored 81 points in total and she played 3 games, then we can calculate her average score per game as follows:  Average Score = Total Points / Number of Games  Therefore, Melissa's average score per game is:  Average Score = 81 / 3 = 27 points per game.
Response:  If Melissa got 109 points for each game and also received 82 bonus points per game, then her total score for all games is: Total score = Game points + Bonus points = 109 x Number of games + 82 x Number of games =? + 82 x Number of games =? Substituting the value given in the problem, we have: Total score = 109 x 79 + 82 x 79 = 8,653 + 6,438 = 15,091 points. Therefore, Melissa scored 15,091 points in all games.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Points = Number of Games x Points Per Game Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total Points = 21 x 5 (since there were 5 games) Substituting this value back into our equation, we get: 21 = 5 x 7 Therefore, there were 5 games played.
"Response:  Since there are 13 games and each game has two players, we can write an equation as follows:
Nagtala si Melissa ng kabuuang 91 puntos sa 13 laro = (Melissa's points in Game 1 + Melissa's points in Game 2 +... + Melissa's points in Game 13) / 2
Now let's find out how many points Melissa got in each of the 13 games:
Game 1: 70 points
Game 2: 65 points
Game 3: 85 points
Game 4: 78 points
Game 5: 92 points
Game 6: 83 points
Game 7: 76 points
Game 8: 80 points
Game 9: 73 points
Game 10: 77 points
Game 11: 82 points
Game 12: 75 points
Game 13: 89 points
So, to calculate Melissa's total score, we add up all her points from each game:
Total score of Melissa = (70 + 65 + 85 + 78 + 92 + 83 + 76 + 80 + 73 + 77 + 82 + 75 + 89) / 2
= 910 / 2
= 455 points
Therefore, Melissa scored 455 points in the 13 games combined."
Response:  If there are 4 cars in total and each car can accommodate 6 people, then the maximum number of people who can ride at once is 4 x 6 = 24. So, the answer is 24.
Response:  The Ferris wheel has 20 seats in total, and each seat can accommodate 9 people at once. If all 20 seats are occupied simultaneously, how many times will the Ferris wheel rotate if there are 18 passengers who want to ride it together?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of passengers (18) by the capacity of one rotation (9). So, the Ferris wheel will rotate 2 times for every 18 passengers who want to ride it together. Therefore, the answer is 2 rotations per 18 passengers.
"Response:  If there are 20 Ferris wheels in Paradise Park and each can accommodate 15 people at a time, then the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheels in one hour is:

20 x 15 = 300 people per hour
So, 300 people can ride the Ferris wheels in Paradise Park in one hour."
"Response:  If there are 18 gondolas in total and each can accommodate 15 people, then the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at any given time is:

18 gondolas x 15 people per gondola = 270 people
So, if 10 gondolas are damaged, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at any given time would be:

270 people - 10 gondolas x 15 people per gondola = 240 people"
Response:  If there are 6 cars in total and each car can accommodate 14 people, then the total number of people who can ride the ferris wheel at once is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Now, if there are currently 16 people waiting to take turns riding the ferris wheel, that means they will have to wait for their turn until all 84 people have taken their turns. So, the number of people who can still join the line after all 84 people have taken their turns is 16 - 84 = -68 people. Therefore, there are no more people who can join the line.
Response:  The small cabin can accommodate 14 people and the big cabin can accommodate 54 people. So, if we divide the total capacity of the Ferris wheel (68 people) by the number of cabins available (2), we get:  Number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel in each cabin = Total capacity / Number of cabins = 68 / 2 = 34 people. Therefore, there are 34 people who can ride the Ferris wheel in each small cabin.
Response:  The small cabin can accommodate 16 people and the large cabin can accommodate 12 people. So, if we want to know how many people can ride in both cabins combined, we need to find their difference: 16 - 12 = 4. Therefore, 4 people can ride in both cabins combined.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park simultaneously, and each Ferris wheel has 4 seats per cabin, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many cabins of the Ferris wheel will be needed. So, 16 / 4 = 4. Therefore, 4 cabins of the Ferris wheel will be needed for all 16 passengers to ride it simultaneously.
Response:  If there are 4 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at Paradise Park in both times, and each person takes 2 turns riding the Ferris wheel, then we have:  Number of turns taken per person = Total number of people x Number of turns per person  In this case, the total number of people is 4, so if each person takes 2 turns, we get:  Number of turns taken per person = 4 x 2 = 8 turns  Therefore, a total of 8 turns will be taken by all 4 people combined.
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of slices (piraso), then the total number of slices for all 7 pizzas is 7 x 7 = 49 slices.  Since there are 14 slices in one pizza, if we divide 49 slices by 14, we get the cost per slice which is $3.57 ($49 / 14).
Response:  If we order $x$ slices of pizza and each pizza has $2$ slices, then the total number of slices we ordered is $\boxed{2x}$.
Response:  If we order 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is: 17 x 4 = 68 slices. So, the cost per slice would be: $68 / 17 = $4.00 per slice.
Response:  If we order 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices we will get is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since there are two of us, if we share the slices equally, each person will get 45 slices (90 / 2).
Response:  According to the problem, Paige and her mother planted 10 flowers per bed. If they have 45 flowerbeds, then they planted a total of 45 x 10 = 450 flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mother are planting 45 flowers among 9 gardens, then they will have to divide them equally among the gardens. So, if we assume that each garden has an equal number of flowers, then the number of flowers per garden is 45/9 = 5. Therefore, the number of butterflies needed for each garden is 5 x 9 = 45 butterflies.
Response:  According to the problem, Paige and her mother planted 36 flowers. Since they planted one seedling per hole, there are 36 holes in total. If each hole can hold 12 seeds, then the total number of seeds planted is 36 x 12 = 432. However, since only 58 grew, we need to subtract that amount from the total number of seeds planted to get the number of seeds that did not grow. Therefore, the answer is 432 - 58 = 374.
Response:  According to the problem, Paige and her mother planted 55 flowers. Since they worked together, we can assume that each of them planted an equal number of flowers. Therefore, if Paige planted x flowers, then her mother planted x flowers as well.  Now, let's analyze the information given in the problem: • The total number of flowers planted is 55 + 15 = 70. This means that for every 2 flowers planted, one more flower grows (since there are 60 flowers growing).  So, if Paige planted x flowers, then the number of flowers she grew would be 2x. Similarly, if her mother planted y flowers, then the number of flowers she grew would be 2y.  To find out how many flowers Paige and her mother planted altogether, we need to add up their individual contributions: Paige planted 2x flowers, while her mother planted 2y flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers planted by both of them is: 2x + 2y = 70. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 34 and y = 36.  So, Paige planted 34 flowers and her mother planted 36 flowers. In conclusion, Paige and her mother planted a total of 70 flowers.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds per pot and they have 60 pots in total, then the number of seeds they planted is:  Number of seeds = Total number of pots x Number of seeds per pot  Number of seeds = 60 x 10  Number of seeds = 600 seeds
Response:  If Paige has 8 flowerbeds and she plants 32 flowers per bed, then the total number of flowers planted is 32 x 8 = 256. Now, if we assume that each flowerbed has an equal number of blooms (butterflies), then the total number of butterflies is also 256 / 8 = 32. So, there are 32 butterflies per flowerbed.
Response:  If Matthew has 11 friends and he gives 2 crackers to each friend, then the total number of crackers given by Matthew is:  11 x 2 = 22 crackers. So, there are 22 crackers in total that Matthew gave away.
Response:  If Matthew has 10 friends and he gives each friend 2 crackers, then the total number of crackers given is 2 x 10 = 20 crackers. So, there are 20 friends who received crackers from Matthew.
Response:  If Matthew has 15 biscuits and he gives an equal number to his 5 friends, then he will give 3 biscuits to each friend (since 15 / 5 = 3). So, the total number of biscuits given away is 3 x 5 = 15.  And if there are still 10 biscuits left after giving them away, that means Matthew had 10 - 15 = -5 biscuits left. Since negative numbers cannot be used in counting, we can conclude that Matthew did not have any biscuits left after giving some away.
Response:  If Matthew has 24 biscuits and he gives an equal number to his 3 friends, then he will give 8 biscuits to each friend (24 / 3 = 8). So, the total number of biscuits given away is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24. Since there are still 17 biscuits left after giving them away, the remaining biscuits are 24 - 17 = 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.
"Response:  If Matthew has 22 biscuits and 34 cakes, then he has in total 56 items (22 + 34 = 56).  Since there are 11 friends sharing these items, each friend will get an equal number of biscuits and cakes. So, if Matthew gives out his biscuits and cakes equally among his 11 friends, each friend will get:

Biscuits: 22 / 11 = 2 biscuits per person
Cakes: 34 / 11 = 3 cakes per person
Therefore, the number of biscuits eaten by each person is 2, and the number of cakes eaten by each person is 3."
Response:  If Matthew has 29 biscuits and 30 cakes, then he has in total 59 items (29 + 30).  If each of his two friends eats an equal number of biscuits and cakes, then they will eat 59 / 2 = 29.5 items each. So, Matthew's two friends together have eaten 29.5 x 2 = 59 items.
Response:  If Matthew has 14 biscuits and 21 cakes, then he has in total 35 sweets (14 biscuits + 21 cakes).  Since there are 7 friends sharing these sweets, each friend will get an equal number of sweets. So, if Matthew gives out his sweets equally among his 7 friends, each friend will get 5 sweets (35 sweets / 7 friends = 5 sweets per friend). Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Matthew has 18 friends and each friend eats an average of 36 biscuits, then we can calculate the total number of biscuits that all 18 friends eat as follows: Total Number of Biscuits = Number of Friends x Average Number of Biscuits per Friend Total Number of Biscuets = 18 x 36 = 648 biscuits So, there are 648 biscuits in total.
Response:  If Matthew has 6 biscuits and he gives one to each of his 3 friends, then he will have 6 - 3 = 3 biscuits left. So, there are 3 biscuits remaining after Matthew gave away 1 biscuit to each of his 3 friends.
Response:  If Matthew has 23 biscuits and he gives an equal number of crackers to his 2 friends, then he will give each friend 5 crackers (since 2 x 5 = 10). So, the total number of biscuits that each friend will get is 23 / 2 = 11. Therefore, each friend will eat 11 biscuits.
Response:  If Matthew has 31 biscuits and he gives an equal number of biscuits to his 5 friends, then he will give 6 biscuits per friend (since 31 / 5 = 6). So, the number of crackers that Matthew gave to his friends is 6 x 5 = 30.
Response:  If there are 4 friends and each friend eats an average of 8 biscuits (since they have 32 in total), then the number of biscuits eaten by all 4 friends is:  Number of biscuits = Total number of biscuits / Number of friends x Average number of biscuits per friend  Number of biscuits = 32 / 4 x 8  Number of biscuits = 128  Therefore, the number of biscuits eaten by all 4 friends is 128.
Response:  If Matthew has 10 biscuits and each of his 4 friends eats an equal number of biscuits (since they are all equally hungry), then each friend will eat 2.5 biscuits ( since there are 10 biscuits in total). Now, if Matthew has 8 cakes and each friend eats one-fourth of them (again, assuming they are equally hungry), then each friend will eat 2 cakes (since there are 8 cakes in total). So, in total, Matthew's 4 friends will eat 4.5 biscuits and 2 cakes, respectively.
Response:  If there are 28 friends and each friend eats an average of 10 biscuits (since we don't know the exact number), then the total number of biscuits consumed is:  28 x 10 = 280 biscuits.  Similarly, if each friend eats an average of 10 pieces of cake (again, assuming no exact number), then the total number of cakes consumed is:  28 x 10 = 280 cakes.  So, in summary, there were 280 biscuits and 280 cakes consumed among the 28 friends.
Response:  If Debbie bought x bottles of water at $1 each and drank 109 bottles in one day, then she spent $x + 109 dollars that day. Since the bottles took 74 days to arrive, we can calculate how much Debbie paid for each bottle as follows:  Total amount spent = $x + 109 Days passed = 74 So, cost per bottle = Total amount / Number of days = ($x + 109) / 74 = $x + 1.45  Therefore, Debbie paid $x + 1.45 for the bottles she bought.
Response:  If they bought 153 bottles of water when they were at the store and Debbie drank an equal number of bottles every day, then we can find out how many days it took her to finish all those bottles.  So if she drank 17 bottles per day, then it will take her x days to finish all 153 bottles.  We know that x = 17 because that is the number of bottles she drinks per day. Therefore, the answer is 9 (x) days.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 264 bottles of water and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then she drank a total of:

Debbie drank 15 bottles/day x 11 days = 165 bottles (drunk)
Adding the number of bottles she bought (264), we get:

264 + 165 = 439 bottles
Therefore, there are 439 bottles left after Debbie finished drinking them all."
Response:  If Debbie bought 301 bottles of water at first and drank 144 bottles in one day, then she has 157 bottles left after that day. So, if she continued to drink 144 bottles per day for x number of days, then her total consumption would be:  Total Consumption = Number of Days x Number of Bottles Drunk per Day = x x 144 = x + 144  Since we are asked how many bottles she consumed after x number of days, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:  Number of Bottles Consumed After x Days = Total Consumption - Initial Amount = (x + 144) x 144 = x + 19280  Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do this, we can use algebraic manipulation or substitution methods. For example, we could solve for x by subtracting 144 from both sides of the equation:  x + 144 = 19280 - 144  x = 19136  Therefore, Debbie consumed 19136 bottles of water after x number of days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale, then she drank 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda in one day. So, the number of bottles of water that Debbie drank per day is 4/88 = 0.05 or 5%. Similarly, the number of bottles of soda that Debbie drank per day is 87/13 = 6.92 or 69.2%. Therefore, the total number of bottles of water that Debbie drank over several days is 5% of 88 = 4.4 (or 44) bottles, and the total number of bottles of soda that Debbie drank over several days is 69.2% of 13 = 9.04 (or 90.4) bottles.
Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale, then she has a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda in one day, then she still has 144 bottles of soda left (456 - 312 = 144).
Response:  If Debbie buys 6 bottles of water per day and she buys it for 3 days, then she will buy 6 x 3 = 18 bottles of water in total.  Now, if she buys 12 bottles of water after that, it means she has bought a total of 18 + 12 = 30 bottles of water in all. So, the time taken to finish these 30 bottles would be 30 / 6 = 5 days. Therefore, the answer is 5 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water during their sale, then she drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda in one day. So, if we divide the number of bottles of water she drank (15) by the total number of bottles of water she bought (180), we get 0.083% or approximately 1/12%. Similarly, if we divide the number of bottles of soda she drank (54) by the total number of bottles of soda she bought (95), we also get 0.083% or approximately 1/12%. Therefore, the number of bottles of water Debbie drank per day is approximately equal to 1/12 of the total number of bottles of water she bought, and similarly for the number of bottles of soda she drank per day.
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda in one day for several days. So, the number of bottles of soda that Debbie drank in total is:  Total number of bottles of soda drunk = Number of bottles of soda drunk per day x Number of days  Total number of bottles of soda drunk = 122/day x (number of days)  Since there are 7 days in a week, if we assume that Debbie drank 122 bottles of water every day, then the total number of bottles of soda that she drank would be:  Total number of bottles of soda drunk = 122/day x 7 days = 854 bottles of soda  Therefore, the correct answer is 854 bottles of soda.
Response:  Since there are 14 Hanay and each has 11 Lapis, we have a total of 14 x 11 = 154 Lapis in all the Hanay combined. So, Faye has 154 Lapis.
Response:  If we have 12 lapis and want to arrange them into 3 rows of 4 each, then we will need to place 4 lapis in each row. So, the number of lapis placed in each row is 4.
Response:  If Faye has 16 lapis in each row and there are 28 packages of lapis with 24 lapis per package, then we can calculate the total number of lapis as follows: Total Number of Lapis = Number of Rows x Number of Lapis per RowTotal Number of Lapis = 16 x (Number of Packages / Number of Lapis per Package)Total Number of Lapis = 16 x 28Total Number of Lapis = 456LapisSo, Faye has made 456 rows of lapis.
Response:  We know that there are 22 pebbles in each row and 5 rows in total. Therefore, the number of pebbles in one row is 22 x 5 = 110. Now, we have 5 packages of pebbles with 14 pebbles in each package. So, the total number of pebbles in all packages is 5 x 14 = 70. Finally, since there are 70 pebbles left after distributing them among the packages, the number of pebbles that Faye has is 110 - 70 = 40. Thus, Faye has 40 pebbles in total.
Response:  If Faye has 35 lapis and 7 crayons, she can make 5 lapis per hilera since each hilera requires 5 lapis. Therefore, if we divide 35 by 5, we get 7. So, Faye can make 7 hileras with her available materials.
Response:  We are given that there are 19 Hanays and each Hanay has 4 Lapis and 27 Kray. To find out how many Lapis Faye has, we need to count the number of Lapis in all the Hanays and then subtract the number of Lapis that Faye has. So, the total number of Lapis is:  19 x 4 = 76 Lapis Now, let's see how many Lapis Faye has:  Faye has 4 Lapis, so she has 76 - 4 = 72 Lapis Therefore, the answer is 72.
Response:  If Faye has 7 boxes with each box containing 36 colored pencils and 30 coloring books, then the total number of colored pencils she has is:  36 x 7 = 252 colored pencils.  Similarly, if she has 30 coloring books, then the total number of colors used in those books is:  30 x 36 = 1080 colors. Therefore, Faye has a total of 252 + 1080 = 1332 colors.
Response:  We have 11 rows with 31 colors each and 27 colors in total. So, we can calculate the number of colors that are repeated as follows:  Number of repeating colors = Total number of colors - Number of unique colors / Number of rows  = 27 - (31 x 11) / 11  = 27 - 340 / 11  = -313 / 11  = -28.57  Therefore, there are approximately 28 colors that repeat among all the rows.
Response:  If we have 30 marbles in total and each row has 5 marbles, then the number of rows is: 30 / 5 = 6. So, Faye made 6 rows of marbles.
Response:  If Faye has 12 pieces of lapis and she wants to divide them equally among her two friends, then each friend will get 6 pieces of lapis. So, the answer is 6.
Response:  If there are 35 packages of lapis and each package contains 4 pieces of lapis, then the total number of pieces of lapis is: 35 x 4 = 140. Since Si Faye placed two pieces of lapis in each row, the number of rows she made is: 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Si Faye made 70 rows of lapis.
"Response:  We know that there are 31 packages of lapis in total and each package contains 6 lapis. So, we have:

Total number of lapis = Number of packages x Number of lapis per package
= 31 x 6
= 186 lapis
Now, let's find out how many lapis Si Faye has. According to the problem, he placed his lapis in rows with 19 lapis in each row. Therefore, the total number of lapis Si Faye has can be calculated as follows:

Total number of lapis = Number of rows x Number of lapis per row
= 19 x (Number of packages / Number of lapis per package)
= 19 x 186/6
= 19 x 307
= 5842 lapis
So, Si Faye has 5842 lapis in total."
Response:  We are given that there are 30 pieces of candy in total and each piece has either 71 or 24 candies inside it. So, we have to find out how many pieces of candy contain 71 candies and how many pieces contain 24 candies.  To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of pieces with 71 candies = Total number of pieces x Probability of having 71 candies per piece Number of pieces with 24 candies = Total number of pieces x Probability of having 24 candies per piece Now, let's calculate these probabilities: Probability of having 71 candies per piece = (Number of pieces with 71 candies) / (Total number of pieces) = (30/30) = 1 Probability of having 24 candies per piece = (Number of pieces with 24 candies) / (Total number of pieces) = (6/30) = 0.2 Since we know that the probability of having 71 candies is 1 and the probability of having 24 candies is 0.2, we can now use these values to solve for the number of pieces containing each type of candy using the above equations: Number of pieces with 71 candies = 30 x 1 = 30 Number of pieces with 24 candies = 30 x 0.2 = 6 Therefore, there are 30 pieces of candy that contain 71 candies and 6 pieces that contain 24 candies.
"Response:  For each of the 16 rectangles with 6 lapis and 21 lapis in each rectangle, we need to count how many crayons are available.  Therefore, the total number of crayons is:

16 x 6 = 96 (crayons for the first 4 rectangles) + 21 x 4 = 84 (crayons for the next 4 rectangles) = 170 crayons."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will be going on the field trip. According to the question, there are 98 students in total who will be attending the field trip. Next, we need to determine how many students will be riding each bus. Based on the information provided, there are 7 buses available for the field trip. Therefore, the number of students per bus is 98 / 7 = 14. So, the total number of upuan (ticket price) for each bus is 14 x $50 = $700.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students are in each classroom. According to the question, there are 84 classrooms in the school.  Next, we need to determine how many students can fit in each school bus. Based on the information provided earlier, each school bus has a capacity of 118 seats. Finally, we add up the total number of students who will be going on the field trip. So, the answer is: Total Number of Students = Number of Classrooms x Number of Students per Classroom + Number of School Buses x Number of Students per School Bus. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total Number of Students = 84 x? + 95 x 118. Solving for?, we get: Total Number of Students = 760 + 109,320 = 110,080. Therefore, there are approximately 110,080 students in the school.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will be in each bus. Since there are 67 students in total and 66 students per class, then there will be 1 student left over who won't have a bus partner. So, the number of students per bus is: 67 / 66 = 1. Therefore, 1 bus is needed for the field trip.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will be in each bus. According to the problem, there are 87 students in total and they will be divided into groups of 58 students per group. Therefore, the number of students in each bus is 58/87 = 0.67 or approximately 1/1.67. Since there are 2 upuan (or seats) per bus, we need at least 1/1.67 x 2 = 1.30 buses to accommodate all the students. So, the answer is 1 to 1.30 buses needed for the field trip.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many students are in each class. We know that there are 24 classes in total and 120 students in the school. So, the number of students in each class is:

Number of students per class = Total number of students / Number of classes
= 120 / 24
= 5

Now, let's find out how many students are in each bus. We know that there are 84 upuan (or seats) in each bus. Since there are 3 buses, the total number of students who can fit in all the buses is:

Total number of students who can fit in all the buses = Number of buses x Number of students per bus
= 3 x 84
= 252

So, the number of students in each class is 5, and the total number of students who can fit in all the buses is 252."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students will go on the field trip per bus. According to the question, there are 102 students in the school and 8 students per bus. Therefore, the total number of students who can go on the field trip per bus is 102 / 8 = 13. So, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, then the remaining students who can go on the field trip are 102 - 22 = 80.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will go on the field trip. We are given that there are 11 students in total and 99 students per bus. So, if 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is:

Number of students going on the field trip = Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go on the field trip
= 11 + (99 - 8)
= 11 + 91
= 102
Therefore, 102 students will go on the field trip."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will be going for the field trip. According to the question, there are 72 students in the school. Next, we need to determine how many students can fit in each bus. Based on the information provided earlier, each bus can accommodate 30 students. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students (72) by the capacity of each bus (30): 72 / 30 = 2.4. So, approximately 2.4 buses are needed to transport all the students for the field trip.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many students will be in each bus. Since there are 46 schools and 92 students per school, the total number of students for all buses is:

46 x 92 = 4088 students
Next, we need to calculate the cost of fuel for each bus. Assuming that each bus consumes $5 worth of fuel, the total cost of fuel for all buses is:

$5 x 4088 = $20,440
Finally, we add the cost of fuel to the cost of maintenance to get the total cost of the field trip:

Total Cost = $20,440 + $300 = $20,740
Therefore, the total cost of the field trip is $20,740."
Response:  If there are 11 boys in class 11 who like to play with marbles and Haley has 9 marbles to give away, then we can find out how many marbles each boy will get by dividing the total number of marbles (9) by the number of boys (11). So, each boy will get approximately 0.818 or 81.8% of one marble from Haley.
"Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and gives each of the boys 5 marbles, then:
Haley - 10 marbles = 5 marbles for each boy (since there are 4 boys)
So, Haley now has 5 marbles left.
The total number of marbles given to the boys is: 5 marbles x 4 boys = 20 marbles."
Response:  If there are 23 marbles in total and Haley wants to keep 15 of them for herself, then how many will each boy get? To find out, we can divide the total number of marbles (23) by the number of boys (4). So, each boy will get: 23 / 4 = 6 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 children who like to play with marbles and each of them has an average of 26 marbles (which is the total number of marbles collected among all 13 children), then we can calculate the total number of marbles as follows: Total Number of Marbles = Number of Children x Average Number of Marbles per Child Total Number of Marbles = 13 x 26 = 318 marbles So, according to the question, if Haley collects 50 marbles, she will have 318 + 50 = 368 marbles in total.
Response:  If there are 20 marbles in total and 2 boys want to play with them equally, then each boy will get 10 marbles (20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If there are 28 boys in total and each boy gets 2 marbles, then the total number of marbles given out is: 2 x 28 = 56 marbles.
"Response:  If Frank reads an average of 14 pages per day and there are 392 pages in the book, then he will take X days to finish reading it, where:
X = Total number of pages / Daily reading speed
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank will need 27 days to finish reading the entire book if he reads an average of 14 pages per day."
Response:  If Frank read 22 pages in one day and took 569 days to finish the book, then he must have read a total of pages. To find out how many pages are in the book, we can use the formula: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of days per page. In this case, the total number of days is 569, and the number of days per page is 1 (since Frank read 22 pages in one day). So, the number of pages in the book is: Number of pages = 569 / 1 = 569 pages. Therefore, there are 569 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that Frank has to finish reading the book in 6 days and it contains 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. To find out how many pages he reads per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days available: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days  In this case, the total number of pages is 612, and the number of days available is 6. So, we can calculate the number of pages read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day Now, let's find out how many pages Frank reads in one day. Since there are 24 chapters in the book, each chapter consists of approximately 43 pages (based on the average page count for a chapter). Therefore, Frank reads approximately 43 pages per chapter. So, if he reads 102 pages per day, he must have read approximately 2.3 chapters per day (102 pages / 43 pages per chapter = 2.3 chapters per day) Conclusion: Based on the calculation above, Frank reads approximately 2.3 chapters per day or 95 pages per day (since there are 24 chapters in the book).
"Response:  We know that there are 5 kabanata in the book and each kabanata has 555 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

5 x 555 = 2775 pages
Now we need to find out how many days it will take Frank to finish reading the book if he reads at a rate of 220 pages per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages Frank reads per day:

2775 pages / 220 pages/day = 12.4 days
So, it will take Frank approximately 12.4 days to finish reading the entire book."
Response:  We know that Frank needs to read 193 pages of his favorite book in 660 days. To find out how many pages he reads per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the time required to finish reading them: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to finish reading = 193 pages / 660 days = 0.29 pages/day Now, let's convert this value to kabanata (chapters) per day: Chapter read per day = Number of pages read per day x Number of pages per chapter = 0.29 pages/day x 15 chapters/book = 4.25 chapters/day So, Frank reads approximately 4.25 chapters of his favorite book every day.
"Response:  If there are x number of books and each book has y pages, then the total number of pages read by Frank in 3 days is given by:

Total pages = Number of books x Pages per book
= xy

Since Frank reads one book every day, he reads x/3 books in one day. Therefore, the number of pages he reads in one day is:

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of books per day
= xy / x
= y

So, Frank reads y pages in one day. Since he reads three books in three days, he reads 3y pages in total."
Response:  If there are x books to read and each book has y pages, then the total number of pages to be read is xy. Since Frank reads one book every day for 12 days, he will have read x/12 books in total. Therefore, the number of pages he has read so far is (x/12)y. To find out how many days it would take him to finish all the books, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: (xy - (x/12)y) / y = 492 / 12 = 40 days. So, Frank needs 40 days to finish reading all the books.
Response:  If it takes Frank 16 days to finish reading his favorite book of 112 pages, then he reads an average of pages per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the number of pages read per day to hours as follows:  Therefore, Frank reads pages per hour. Now, let's calculate how many minutes he spends reading each page:  So, Frank spends minutes reading each page. Finally, to find out how many minutes he spent reading the entire book, we multiply the total number of pages by the time taken to read each page:  Hence, Frank spent minutes reading his favorite book.
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages of his favorite book in one day and there are 576 pages in total, then he has read 576/8 = 72 pages per day. So, to find out how many days it will take him to finish reading the entire book, we can divide the number of pages left in the book (576) by the number of pages he reads per day (72): 576 / 72 = 8 days. Therefore, Frank will need 8 days to finish reading his favorite book if he continues reading at the same pace.
Response:  We know that there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages. To finish reading the entire book within 30 days, Frank needs to read an average of 12.67 pages per day (450/41 = 12.67). So, he will have read 41 x 12.67 = 509 pages in one day.
"Response:  We know that there are three kabanata in the book and each kabanata has 594 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

Total Number of Pages = Number of Kabanata x Number of Pages per Kabanata
= 3 x 594
= 1782
Now we need to find out how many days it will take Frank to finish reading the book if he reads at a rate of 607 pages per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages Frank reads per day:

Number of Days = Total Number of Pages / Number of Pages per Day
= 1782 / 607
= 29.5 days
So, it will take Frank approximately 29.5 days to finish reading the entire book."
"Response:  We know that Frank needs to read 664 pages of his favorite book in total. Since each chapter has 405 pages, we can calculate how many chapters he needs to finish reading per day as follows:

Total number of chapters = Total number of pages / Number of pages per chapter
= 664 pages / 405 pages per chapter
= 1.61 chapters per day

Therefore, Frank reads approximately 1.61 chapters per day."
Response:  If there are 5 DVDs in each package and they cost $120 altogether, then the cost of each individual DVD is:  $120 / 5 = $24 per DVD. Therefore, the price of each pack is $24.
Response:  The cost of each pack is $81. If you want to buy 33 packs, you will need to pay $81 x 33 = $2693. So, the total cost for buying all 33 packs would be $2693.
"Response:  If each package of DVD costs $107, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows:

$93 / $107 = x

Now, to find out how many packages you can buy, divide the number of packages by the cost per package:

x packages / $107 = y

So, if you want to know how many packages of DVD you can buy at $93 each, the answer is y packages."
Response:  The cost of each DVD is $76. If there are 25 dollars off for every package, then we need to find out how much one package costs. So, we divide $76 by 25:  $76 / 25 = $3.04 per package. Therefore, you can buy each package for $3.04.
"Response:  If there are 104 dollars and you can buy x number of DVD packs with each pack costing $26, then we have the following equation:

Total amount = Number of DVD packs x Price per pack
= 104 dollars x 26 dollars/pack
= 2784 dollars
So, you can buy 2784 / 26 = 105 DVD packs with your $104."
Response: 1 pack costs $28, and there are 2 packs available for purchase. So, the cost of each pack is: $28 / 2 = $14 per pack.
"Response:  If there are n groups of saging and each group has at least 2 saging, then the total number of saging is given by:

n x (n-1) / 2 =  Total number of saging

So, if n = 5 (as given in the problem), then the total number of saging is:

5 x (4 - 1) / 2 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 saging in Philip's collection."
Response:  If there are 140 groups of 187 saging in Philip's collection, then we can calculate the total number of saging as follows: Total Number of Saging = Number of Groups x Number of Saging per Group Total Number of Saging = 140 x 187 = 23,800 saging. Therefore, there are approximately 23,800 saging in Philip's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 7 groups of saging and each group has 63 saging, so the total number of saging in all 7 groups is 63 x 7 = 431. Now, we also know that there are 95 groups of kahel and each group has an equal number of kahel, so the total number of kahel in all 95 groups is 95 x 1 = 95. Therefore, the difference between the total number of saging and the total number of kahel is 431 - 95 = 336.
Response:  We have 47 groups of saging and each group has 356 saging in total, so we can write this as follows: 47 x 356 = 16,902. Now, let's consider the number of groups of kahel. There are 178 groups of kahel, and each group contains 10 pieces of kahel, so we can write this as follows: 178 x 10 = 1,780. Therefore, the difference between the total number of saging and the total number of kahel is: 16,902 - 1,780 = 15,122.
Response:  If there are 196 groups of saging in Philip's collection and each group has an average of 392 saging, then we can calculate the total number of saging as follows: Total Number of Saging = Number of Groups x Average Number of Saging per Group Total Number of Saging = 196 x 392 Total Number of Saging = 70,456 saging. Therefore, there are approximately 70,456 saging in Philip's collection if each group contains an average of 392 saging.
"Response:  If there are 180 saging in Philip's collection and each group has at least 18 saging, then we can divide the total number of saging into groups as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of saging / Minimum number of saging per group
= 180 / 18
= 10

So, there are 10 groups of saging in Philip's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 87 kilograms of bananas and they are divided into two groups with 45 kilograms in each group. So, we can say that Group A has 45 kilograms of bananas and Group B has 45 kilograms of bananas as well. Now, let's calculate how many kilograms of bananas are in each group:
Group A has 45 kilograms of bananas / 2 = 22.5 kilograms per group
Group B also has 45 kilograms of bananas / 2 = 22.5 kilograms per group
So, there are 22.5 kilograms of bananas in each group. Therefore, the total number of kilograms of bananas is: 2 x 22.5 = 45 kilograms"
Response:  We have 384 fruits in total and they are divided into 345 groups of fruits. Each group has an average of 4 fruits. So, we can calculate the number of fruits per group as follows: Number of fruits per group = Total number of fruits / Number of groups = 384 / 345 = 10.7  Now, let's move to the second part of the question where we have 192 pieces of candy in total and they are divided into 16 groups of candies. Since each group contains an average of 11 pieces of candy (based on the information provided), we can calculate the number of pieces of candy per group as follows: Number of pieces of candy per group = Total number of candies / Number of groups = 192 / 16 = 11.5  Therefore, the answer to the question is 10.7 for the first part and 11.5 for the second part.
Response:  If Brenda made 38 cookies and each cookie has 19 pieces, then she made a total of 672 pieces (38 x 19 = 672). So, Brenda made 672 pieces of cookies for the visitors.
Response:  If Brenda made 14 batches of cookies and each batch contains 30 cookies, then the total number of cookies she made is:  Total Number of Cookies = Number of Batches x Number of Cookies per Batch  Total Number of Cookies = 14 x 30  Total Number of Cookies = 420 cookies.
Response:  If there are 5 people who will eat the cookies and each person gets an equal share of 22 cookies, then each person will get 4.4 cookies (22 / 5 = 4.4). However, since Brenda has to give away 17 cookies, she will have to distribute them equally among the remaining 4 people, so each person will get 3.85 cookies (17 / 4 = 3.85). Therefore, the answer is 3.85.
"Response:  If Brenda made 18 cookies and each guest received an equal number of cookies (so if 9 guests came, they would have received 2 cookies each), then we can calculate how many cookies each guest got as follows:

Number of cookies per guest = Total number of cookies / Number of guests
= 18 / 9
= 2

So each guest received 2 cookies."
Response:  If Brenda has 14 cookies and she wants to share them equally among 2 visitors, then each visitor will get 7 cookies (since 14 divided by 2 equals 7). Now, let's find out how many pairs of identical cookies there are. Since each pair consists of two cookies with the same number, we can count the number of pairs as follows:  Number of pairs = Total number of cookies / 2  In this case, the total number of cookies is 14, so:  Number of pairs = 14 / 2 = 7 pairs  Therefore, there are 7 pairs of identical cookies.
Response:  If Brenda gives out 2 cookies to each visitor and she prepared 10 cookies for the visitors, then the total number of cookies given out is:  Number of visitors x Number of cookies per visitor = Total number of cookies given out  In this case, if Brenda gave out 2 cookies to each of the 5 visitors, then the total number of cookies given out would be: 5 visitors x 2 cookies/visitor = 10 cookies Given out So, the answer is 10 cookies.
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two bags that are identical in size, then each bag will contain how many pieces of candy?  To find out, we can simply divide the total number of candies (42) by the number of bags (2). So, each bag will have 21 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank has 26 bags of chocolates and each bag contains 33 pieces, then the total number of pieces of chocolates that Frank has is:  Total Number of Pieces = Number of Bags x Number of Pieces per Bag  Total Number of Pieces = 26 x 33  Total Number of Pieces = 878 pieces of chocolates.
Response:  If Frank has 33 pieces of candy and he lost 24 pieces, then he has 9 pieces left. Now, if we divide the remaining candies (9) by the number of bags (4), we get 2 candies per bag. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Frank has 11 bottles of ketchup and each bottle contains 11 piraso (pieces), then he has a total of 11 x 11 = 121 pieces of ketchup.  If he also has 22 bottles of ketchup in total, then he has a total of 22 + 121 = 143 pieces of ketchup altogether.
Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of chocolates and he wants to divide them equally among two bags, then each bag will have how many pieces of chocolates?  To find out, we can use division.  So, if Frank has 16 pieces of chocolates and he wants to divide them equally among two bags, then each bag will have 16 / 2 = 8 pieces of chocolates.
Response:  If Shirley has 25 pieces of trefoils and each piece contains 14 knots, then we can calculate the total number of knots as follows: Total Number of Knots = Number of Pieces x Number of Knots per Piece Total Number of Knots = 25 x 14 = 350 knots Therefore, there are 350 knots in all the 25 pieces of trefoils that Shirley has.
"Response:  If Shirley has 10 packets of trefoils and each packet contains 5 pieces, then we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

Total number of pieces = Number of packets x Number of pieces per packet
= 10 x 5
= 50 pieces
Therefore, there are 50 pieces of trefoils in total."
Response:  If Isang Grocery Store has 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda, then we can say that they have a total of 76 bottles (67 + 9 = 76) of soda in general. Now, if they drank more regular soda than diet soda, let's assume that they drank x bottles of regular soda and y bottles of diet soda. Then, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of bottles drunk = Number of bottles of regular soda drunk + Number of bottles of diet soda drunk  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Total number of bottles drunk = 76 + x  Since they drank more regular soda than diet soda, we know that x > y. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:  Total number of bottles drunk = 76 + x - y  Now, we are asked how many more bottles of regular soda were consumed than diet soda. To find this out, we need to subtract y from x:  More bottles of regular soda consumed = x - y  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  More bottles of regular soda consumed = 76 - 9 = 67  So, there were 67 more bottles of regular soda consumed than diet soda.
Response:  If Isang Grocery Store received 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda, then we can say that they received more diet soda than regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of diet soda they received, we need to subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles. So, if we subtract 22 from 61, we get 39. Therefore, Isang Grocery Store received 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
Response:  The regular soda has 8 bottles and the diet soda has 41 cans. So, if they have both together, then their total number of bottles or cans would be 8 + 41 = 59. Therefore, they brought 59 bottles or cans to the market.
Response:  If there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda, then we can say that the number of bottles of regular soda is greater than 53 (since it exceeds half of the total number of bottles). Therefore, if they drank x bottles of regular soda, then x > 53. Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda they drank compared to diet soda. We know that the sum of their consumption of both types of soda is equal to 106 (since 79 + 53 = 106). So, we can write an equation as follows: x + 42 = 106. Solving for x, we get: x = 63. Therefore, they drank 63 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  If there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda, then we can say that the number of bottles of regular soda consumed is equal to the number of bottles of diet soda divided by 2 (since they have both been equally distributed). So, if they consumed x bottles of diet soda, they would have consumed 2x bottles of regular soda. Now, since they drank 12 mangoes, we know that 12/2 = 6 mangoes were drunk per bottle of regular soda. Therefore, the total number of mangoes drunk is 6x = 72 mangoes.  So, the answer is 72 mangoes.
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. If they consume 29 mangos, then we can calculate how many bottles of diet soda they consumed based on the ratio of regular to diet soda consumption.  So if they consume x bottles of diet soda, then the number of regular soda consumed is 17 - 3x. Therefore, the answer is 36 bottles of diet soda were consumed.
Response:  If there are 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda, then we can say that the number of bottles of regular soda consumed is equal to 60 - 19 = 41. So, 41 bottles of regular soda were consumed more than the number of bottles of diet soda.
"Response:  The given information are as follows:
Grocery Store has 72 bottles of regular soda and 32 bottles of diet soda.
The volume of one bottle of regular soda is 1 liter or 1000 milliliters (mL).
The volume of one bottle of diet soda is also 1 liter or 1000 mL.
Now, let's convert both quantities to the same unit of measurement, which in this case is liters (L). To do this, we divide each quantity by 1000, since there are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter:
Regular Soda: 72 bottles x 1 L/1000 mL = 72 L
Diet Soda: 32 bottles x 1 L/1000 mL = 32 L
Now that we have both quantities in liters, we can compare them directly:
There are 44 liters more of diet soda than regular soda (44 L = 32 L - 72 L). Therefore, the answer is 44 liters."
Response:  The total number of cans of regular soda = 36 x 80 = 2880 cans.  The total number of cans of diet soda = 54 x 36 = 1976 cans. So, there are more cans of diet soda than regular soda (1976 - 2880 = 794).
Response:  The total number of bottles in the store is 30 and out of that, 28 are regular soda bottles, leaving 2 bottles for diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles consumed is 2.
Response:  If one grocery store has 4 bottles of diet soda and another store has 79 bottles of regular soda, we can calculate how many more bottles of regular soda they consume if they buy the same amount of both drinks.  To do this, we need to divide the number of bottles of regular soda by the number of bottles of diet soda.  In this case, if they consume 79 bottles of regular soda for every 4 bottles of diet soda, then they consume 19.75 times as much regular soda as diet soda (79 / 4 = 19.75).
Response:  The regular soda has 57 bottles, and we know that it contains sugar or calories. Diet soda has 26 bottles less than the regular soda because it has fewer calories. Lite soda also has 27 bottles less than the regular soda since it has even fewer calories than the diet soda. So if you combine all three types of soda together, they would have a total of 100 bottles (57 + 26 - 27). Therefore, the number of bottles brought to the common area is 100.
Response:  The total number of bottles of each type of soda are as follows: Regular - 81 Diet Soda - 60 Lite Soda - 60 So, we have a total of 201 bottles of soda in stock. Now, let's find out how many more regular soda bottles they have than diet soda bottles: Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of soda bottles - Number of diet soda bottles = 201 - 60 = 141 Therefore, there are 141 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles.
Response:  The total number of bottles of soda they have in their inventory is 49 + 40 + 6 = 105 bottles. Since they consumed 40 bottles of Diet Soda and 6 bottles of Lite Soda, the remaining amount of Regular Soda they had after consumption is: 105 - 40 - 6 = 63 bottles. So, the number of bottles of Regular Soda that they consumed is 63 / 4 = 15.75 bottles.
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day and Rachel found out that 295 of them visited the palace that day, then we can conclude that there are 22 more visitors than the previous day (317 - 295 = 22). So, the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on that day is 22 more than the number of visitors who visited the previous day.
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and they visited for an average of 25 days each, then we can calculate how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace in total over the past day as follows:
Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Total number of days they stayed
= 703 visitors / 25 days
= 28 days
So, if there were 703 visitors who came to Buckingham Palace yesterday, and they stayed for an average of 28 days, then the total number of visitors that have gone to Buckingham Palace over the past 25 days is:
Total number of visitors = 28 days \* 24 hours/day
= 672 visitors
Therefore, based on the information provided, approximately 672 visitors go to Buckingham Palace every day."
Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 666 visitors per day more than yesterday, then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in one day is:  Total Number of Visitors = Yesterday's Visitors + (Today's Visitors - Yesterday's Visitors)  Substituting the given values:  Total Number of Visitors = 100 + (666 - 100)  Total Number of Visitors = 766  Therefore, there are 766 visitors to Buckingham Palace every day more than yesterday.
Response:  We know that there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and we want to find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace over the past 327 days. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of visitors per day x Total number of days = Total number of visitors. In this case, if 406 people visited Buckingham Palace each day, then the total number of visitors over the past 327 days would be: 406 x 327 = 130,580 visitors. So, there were approximately 130,580 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 327 days.
Response:  If there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and there are 829 people who have visited in total over the past 85 days, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Average Number of Visitors = Total Number of Visitors / Number of Days  Average Number of Visitors = 829 / 85  Average Number of Visitors = 10  So, on that particular day, approximately 10 visitors came to see Buckingham Palace.
Response:  If there were 71 paintings at Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that 557 visitors came to see them on that particular day, then we can assume that the average number of visitors per day is 557 / 71 = 7.64 (round down to 7).  Now, if there were 188 visitors in total over the past 57 days, we can calculate it as follows:  Total number of visitors x Number of days = 188 x 57 = 10,696. So, approximately 10,700 visitors visited Buckingham Palace during those 57 days.
Response:  We know that there were 39 paintings of Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that 661 people visited it that day. If we subtract the number of visitors from the total number of paintings, we get:  Number of remaining paintings = Total number of paintings - Number of visitors  Number of remaining paintings = 39 - 661 = -572  Therefore, there are 572 fewer visitors at Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous day.
Response:  If there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 419 visitors in total during the previous day, then the number of visitors who visited before that day is:  Number of visitors before = Total number of visitors - Visitors on the current day = 419 - 92 = 327 visitors.  Similarly, if there were 103 visitors before the previous day, then the number of visitors who visited before two days ago is: Number of visitors before two days ago = Total number of visitors - Visitors on the current day - Visitors on the previous day = 419 - 92 - 103 = 216 visitors.
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day and 471 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 41 (512 - 471).  If we subtract this difference from the total number of visitors over the past 89 days, we get 363 visitors (808 - 41 = 363). Therefore, there were 363 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days.
Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 191 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 705 - 191 = 514 visitors.  If there were 457 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day before that (the day before the previous day), then the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 3 days is 457 + 191 + 514 = 1162 visitors.
Response:  We know that there are 159 grams of wax needed to stick all the candles together. If each candle requires an average of 628 grams of wax, how many candles can be made with the given amount of wax? To find out, we need to divide the total weight of wax (in grams) by the average weight of one candle (in grams). So, if we have 159 grams of wax and each candle needs an average of 628 grams of wax, then we can make: Number of candles = Total weight of wax / Average weight of one candle = 159 g / 628 g = 0.25 or 1/4 candle Using this calculation, we can determine that the person can make approximately 1/4 of a candle using the given amount of wax.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the candies is 49g and we need to subtract 260g from it. So, the remaining weight after subtraction would be: 49 - 260 = -211g. Therefore, the amount of wax needed for the remaining candy pieces is -211g.
Response:  We know that we need to use 57g of paint to color the beads and wax. The weight of each bead is 353 grams, so we will need 57/353 = 0.16 grams of wax for every gram of bead. Therefore, if he has x grams of beads, he needs x / 0.16 = 684 grams of wax. So, he needs 22 grams of wax since he has 684 grams of beads.
Response:  If he needs 166g of wax and now has only 20g left, then he needs an additional 146g of wax.
Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of wax and we need to calculate how much is needed for each balloon. If we divide the total amount of wax (557 grams) by the number of balloons (x), we get: x = 557 / 17 = 32.6 grams per balloon. So, the answer is 32.6 grams.
Response:  If he has 11 grams of wax and needs 492 grams more to fill his containers, then we can calculate how much he still needs as follows:  Gram needed = Total amount needed - Amount already available = 492 grams - 11 grams = 481 grams So, he still needs 481 grams of wax.
Response:  We know that there are 90 bags of rice to be checked and the inspector has 6 days to do it. If he checks one bag per hour, then: Number of hours = Total number of bags / Time taken to check one bag  Number of hours = 90 / 1 = 90 hours So, the inspector will take 90 hours to check all the bags of rice.
"Response:  We know that there are 266 people who filled up their gas tanks and that they took 5 days to do so. To find out how many gallons of gas were sold per day, we can divide the total number of gallons by the number of days taken to fill up the gas tanks. So, if 90 gallons of gas were sold each day, then:

Number of gallons of gas sold per day = Total number of gallons / Number of days taken to fill up the gas tanks
= 266 / 5
= 53 gallons of gas sold per day
Therefore, the answer is 53 gallons of gas sold per day."
Response:  We know that there are 294 people who filled up their water containers every day and we also know that each person fills an average of 244 bottles per day. This means that the total number of bottles filled up daily is 244 x 294 = 65,836 bottles per day. Now, let's find out how many bottles were left unsold after 146 days. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bottles sold during those 146 days from the total number of bottles available for sale. So, if 47 bottles of raspberry flavor were sold per day, then the remaining bottles unsold after 146 days would be 65,836 - (47 x 146) = 60,776 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 235 people who filled their bags with raspberries and 221 people who filled their bags with strawberries. To find out how many bags of strawberries were filled over a period of 77 days, we can use the following formula: Number of bags = Total number of people x Number of days / Number of days per person. In this case, the total number of people is 235 + 221 = 456, and the number of days is 77. So, to find out how many bags of strawberries were filled during those 77 days, we can plug these values into the formula as follows: Number of bags = 456 x 77 / 2 = 198 bags. Therefore, there were 198 bags of strawberries filled over the course of 77 days.
Response:  The number of days saved = Number of days passed - Number of times he checked the trees + 1 (since it started from day 1)  So, in this case, the number of days saved = 57 - 57 + 1 = 0 days saved.  Therefore, there are no days saved.
Response:  We know that there are 36 people who will be checking the bags of rice for their last stop. Each person can check 8 bags of rice per day. To calculate how many days it will take to count all 240 bags of rice, we need to divide the total number of bags by the number of people checking them per day:  Number of days = Total number of bags / Number of people checking per day  In this case, the total number of bags of rice is 240, and the number of people checking them per day is 36. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get our answer:  Number of days = 240 / 36 = 6.94 years  Therefore, it will take approximately 6.94 years to count all 240 bags of rice if 36 people are checking them per day.
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for sea creatures in total and each aquarium has an average of 52 sea creatures inside it. So, we can calculate the number of sea creatures in each aquarium as follows: Number of sea creatures per aquarium = Total number of sea creatures / Number of aquariums = 52 / 26 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 sea creatures in each aquarium.
Response:  We are given that there are 40 creatures in total and each aquarium has at least 2 creatures inside it. So, we can start counting from 1 to 40. Since each aquarium has at least 2 creatures, the number of aquariums is equal to the number of creatures divided by 2. Therefore, the number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20.
Response:  Aquarium for freshwater fish = 56 x $20 = $1,120  Aquarium for brackish water fish = 10 x $30 = $300 Total cost of all aquariums = $1,420 Now, let's count the number of fish in each aquarium: Freshwater aquarium = 39 x $5 = $195 Brackish water aquarium = 39 x $7 = $283 Total value of all fish = $195 + $283 = $478 So, Tyler has $478 worth of fish.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 74 aquariums for fish in saltwater and 22 aquariums for fish in freshwater. Then, each aquarium contains 46 fish. So, the total number of fish is: 74 x 46 = 3352 fish in saltwater aquariums And: 22 x 46 = 1008 fish in freshwater aquariums Therefore, Tyler has around 2350 fish (3352 - 1008) in his aquariums.
Response:  Aquarium for fish in clean water = 62. Aquarium for fish in dirty water = 19. Total number of fish = Number of fish in clean water + Number of fish in dirty water. Therefore, the total number of fish is 62 + 19 = 81. So there are 81 fish in the aquarium.
Response:  If Ang puts 13 T-shirts in each package and buys 39 T-shirts in total, then he will need 39 / 13 = 3 packages of 13 T-shirts each. So, there will be 3 packages.
Response:  If Nanay buys 66 T-shirts and each package contains 3 T-shirts, then we need to divide 66 by 3 to find out how many packages she will buy. So, the answer is 22 packages (66 / 3 = 22).
Response:  If Nanay buys 28 packages of T-shirts with each package containing 56 T-shirts in total, then we can calculate the number of T-shirts per package as follows: Number of T-shirts per package = Total number of T-shirts / Number of packages = 56 T-shirts / 28 packages = 2 T-shirts per package Now, if we want to know how many T-shirts are in all the packages combined, we can multiply the number of T-shirts per package by the total number of packages: Total number of T-shirts = Number of T-shirts per package x Total number of packages = 2 T-shirts/package x 28 packages = 56 T-shirts So, there are 56 T-shirts in all the packages combined.
Response:  If Mama buys 57 packs of T-shirts and each pack contains 6 T-shirts, then she will buy a total of 57 x 6 = 342 T-shirts. Now, if she also buys 34 pairs of pants, then she will have a total of 34 + 34 = 68 pieces of clothing in all. So, to answer your question, Mama will have 68 T-shirts and 34 pairs of pants.
"Response:  If Nanay buys 51 pieces of T-shirts and each package contains 3 shirts, then...

1. Number of packages = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per package
= 51 / 3
= 17 packages

So, Nanay will buy 17 packages of T-shirts."
"Response:  If Mama buys 70 T-shirts in total and each package contains 4 T-shirts, then:
Number of packages = Total number of T-shirts / Number of T-shirts per package
= 70 / 4
= 17.5 packages
Since there are 14 packages available, Mama can buy up to 14 x 4 = 56 T-shirts."
Response:  We have 4 bags of cookies with different weights as follows: Bag A - 12 cookies (weight = 12) Bag B - 8 cookies (weight = 8) Bag C - 9 cookies (weight = 9) Bag D - 7 cookies (weight = 7) Total weight of all cookies = 12 + 8 + 9 + 7 = 46 Now, we want to find out how much each cookie costs per bag. To do this, we divide the total weight of all cookies by the number of bags: Cost per bag = Total weight of all cookies / Number of bags = 46 / 4 = $11.50 per bag So, if you buy all 4 bags of cookies, you will pay $11.50 x 4 = $46 for all of them.
Response:  If Kung has 33 cookies and each bag contains 11 cookies, then the number of bags that Kung can have is:  Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags So, Kung can have 3 bags of cookies.
Response:  If each bag of cookies contains 41 cookies and you have 53 bags of cookies in total, then the number of cookies you have is equal to the number of bags of cookies multiplied by the number of cookies per bag. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of cookies = 53 x 41 = 2,193 cookies.
Response:  We have 14 cookies in total and we want to know how many cookies are in each bag. If there are 7 bags, then we can divide the total number of cookies by 7 to find out how many cookies are in each bag. So, the answer is:  Number of cookies per bag = Total number of cookies / Number of bags = 14 cookies / 7 bags = 2 cookies per bag.
Response:  If each bag contains 3 cookies and you have 21 cookies in total, then the number of bags needed to contain all those cookies is: Number of Cookies / Number of Cookies per Bag = Number of Bags needed  In this case, we have: Number of Cookies = 21 Cookies per Bag = 3 So, we need: 21 / 3 = 7 bags to contain all the cookies. Therefore, there are 7 bags needed to hold all the cookies if each bag contains 3 cookies and you have 21 cookies in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 26 bags of cookies in total. Then, we have 15 kendis (containers) and 52 cookies per kendi. Therefore, to find out how many cookies each bag contains, we can divide the number of cookies per kendi by the number of kendis: Number of cookies per bag = Number of cookies per kendi / Number of kendis = 52 cookies / 15 kendis = 3.4 Cookies per bag So, if you have 26 bags of cookies, then you have a total of 26 x 3.4 = 87.2 cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags of cookies and each bag contains 50 cookies. So, the total number of cookies in all 14 bags is:  14 x 50 = 700 cookies. Now, we also know that out of these 700 cookies, 28 are left over after distributing them among the 86 candies. Therefore, the remaining amount of cookies after distribution is:  700 - 28 = 672 cookies.
Response:  If an average house has 5 people per household and there are 10 houses in one block, then the total number of households in that block would be 10 x 5 = 50.  Now, if each mail carrier delivers 25 pieces of junk mail to every household, then the total number of junk mails delivered to all households in that block would be 50 x 25 = 1250.
Response:  If there are 10 houses in one block and each house receives 9 pieces of junk mail per day, then the total number of pieces of junk mail received by all 10 houses per day is:  Total = Number of houses x Number of pieces of junk mail per house/day  Total = 10 x 9/day  Total = 90 pieces of junk mail per day.  Now, if there are 20 houses in one block, how many pieces of junk mail will each house receive per day?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail received by all 20 houses per day by the number of houses:  Pieces of junk mail per house/day = Total/Number of houses  Pieces of junk mail per house/day = 90/20  Pieces of junk mail per house/day = 4.5 pieces of junk mail per day.
"Response:  If there are 10 blocks in the area and each block has an average of 5 pieces of junk mail per house, then we have:

Number of houses = Number of blocks x Average number of pieces of junk mail per house
= 10 blocks x 5 pieces/house
= 50 pieces of junk mail per day

So, if the postman needs to deliver 24 packets of junk mail per day, he will need to make 24 / 50 = 0.48 trips per day (round up to 0.5 trips per day)."
"Response:  If one Postman can give 14 Junk Mail to each house in a block, and there are 30 houses in a block, then:

Postman can give 14 x 30 = 420 Junk Mail in total.
Since Postman needs to give 2 pieces of Junk Mail per house, he will need to make 420 / 2 = 210 trips to deliver all the Junk Mail."
Response:  There are 100 houses in the entire neighborhood (not just one). Each house has an average of 4 occupants per household, so there are 100 x 4 = 400 people living in the neighborhood. Now, we need to calculate how many pieces of junk mail each person will receive based on the given information. If it takes 32 pieces of junk mail to fill one box, then we can calculate the total number of boxes needed as follows: Total Number of Boxes = Total Number of People x Number of Pieces per Box So, Total Number of Boxes = 400 people x 32 pieces/box = 12800 boxes. Therefore, if there is only one postman delivering all these boxes, he would have to deliver approximately 12800 / 1 = 12800 packages per day!
"Response:  If there are 78 blocks and each block has 30 pieces of junk mail, then the total number of pieces of junk mail needed is:

78 x 30 = 2340

So, Angela needs to deliver 2340 pieces of junk mail in total."
Response:  If Postman needs to deliver 8 pieces of junk mail per house in a neighborhood with 55 houses and he delivers 32 mails to each house, then we can calculate the total number of junk mails delivered as follows: Total Number of Junk Mail = Number of Houses x Number of Pieces Delivered per House Total Number of Junk Mail = 55 x 32 = 1700 junk mails. Therefore, there are 1700 junk mails that Postman needs to deliver to all the houses in the neighborhood.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many households there are in each block. According to the question, there are 81 blocks in total, and each block has 12 houses. Therefore, the number of households per block is 12.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of households in all 81 blocks. This can be done by multiplying the number of blocks (81) with the number of households per block (12):  Total Number of Households = 81 x 12 = 972 households.  Now that we have found the total number of households, we can divide it by the number of Postmen required to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each household. Since there are 4 pieces of junk mail to be delivered to each household, we will require 972 / 4 = 243 Postmen to complete this task. So, the answer is 243 Postmen needed to deliver 4 pieces of junk mail to each of the 972 households in the given area.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many households there are in each of the 16 blocks. Since there are 17 houses in each block, the total number of households in all 16 blocks would be:

16 x 17 = 252 households

Next, we need to calculate the number of pieces of junk mail that one Postman can deliver per day. According to the question, one Postman can deliver 4 pieces of junk mail per household per day. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail that one Postman can deliver per day is:

252 households x 4 pieces/household/day = 1008 pieces of junk mail per day

So, if there are 1 Postman for every 16 blocks (as stated in the question), and each Postman delivers 1008 pieces of junk mail per day, then the total number of pieces of junk mail delivered by all Postmen in a day would be:

16 x 17 = 252 blocks x 1008 pieces/day = 252,000 pieces of junk mail per day"
Response:  If Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles, then she has a total of 30 items in her collection (10 eggs + 20 marbles = 30). Now, we are asked to determine how many groups of 4 items Rebecca can make with these 30 items. To do this, we need to divide 30 by 4, which gives us 7.5 groups of 4 items each. Since you cannot have a half-group, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 groups of 4 items each. Therefore, there are 8 groups of 4 items each that Rebecca can make using her collection of 30 items.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 balls and 15 eggs. If we divide these equally among 5 groups of people, then each group will get:

10/5 = 2 balls per group
15/5 = 3 eggs per group

So there are 5 groups in total."
Response:  If there are 11 groups of itlogs and each group has 2 itlogs, then the total number of itlogs in all groups is 11 x 2 = 22. Since Rebecca is one of the itlogs, that means she appears in exactly 2/22 or 9.5% of the groups. So, the answer to the question is 9.5%.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 groups and each group has a different number of eggs. Group A has 2 eggs, Group B has 3 eggs, Group C has 5 eggs, and Group D has 7 eggs. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

Group A - 2 eggs
Group B - 3 eggs
Group C - 5 eggs
Group D - 7 eggs

Now, let's find out how many eggs Rebecca has in total. According to the problem, Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. Since she doesn't have any marbles in Group A or Group B, her eggs must be in Groups C or D. Therefore, we can add up the number of eggs in these two groups to get the total number of eggs Rebecca has:

Group C + Group D = Total number of eggs
5 + 7 = 12

So, Rebecca has 12 eggs in total."
Response:  We know that there are three groups of eggs and each group has a different number of eggs. Group A has 20 eggs, Group B has 18 eggs, and Group C has 16 eggs. Now we need to find out how many eggs will be in each group. To do this, we can divide the total number of eggs (4 + 15 = 19) equally among the three groups. So, Group A will have 6 eggs (out of 20), Group B will have 7 eggs (out of 18), and Group C will have 6 eggs (out of 16). Therefore, the number of eggs in each group is as follows: Group A - 6 eggs, Group B - 7 eggs, and Group C - 6 eggs.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs in Group 1 and 72 slices of cake in Group 2. Therefore, we can write this as follows:
Rebecca's collection = 18 + 72 = 90
Now, let's find out how many groups there are:
Number of groups = Total number of items / Number of items per group
= 90 / 6 (since each group contains 6 items)
= 15 groups
So, there are 15 groups in total."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 pieces of fruits and 27 eggs in total. If we divide this number equally among three groups, each group will have:

Group 1: 99 / 3 = 33 pieces of fruit
Group 2: 99 / 3 = 33 pieces of fruit
Group 3: 99 / 3 = 33 pieces of fruit

So there are 3 groups with 33 pieces of fruit each."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. The total number of objects she has is 20 + 6 = 26. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs than marbles Rebecca has. To do this, we divide the number of eggs by the number of marbles: 20 / 6 = 3. So, for every 3 marbles that Rebecca has, she has 1 egg. Therefore, there are 3 times as many eggs as marbles that Rebecca has.
Response:  We know that there are 20 groups of eggs and Rebecca has 5 eggs in total. So, she has 5/20 = 1/4 or 25% of all the eggs. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Rebecca has than the marbles. The marbles have 12 eggs, so Rebecca has 12 - 5 = 7 more eggs than the marbles. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than the marbles by 7 eggs.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in a trivia game with 10 rounds, then he got an average score of 15.4 points per round (154 / 10 = 15.4).
Response:  If Luke got 46 points in each of the 177 rounds, then he would have scored a total of 46 x 177 = 8,202 points.
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing two rounds of the trivia game and he received twice as many points for each correct answer in each round, then we can calculate his total score as follows: Round 1: Luke answered 10 questions correctly and received 2 x 10 = 20 points. Round 2: Luke answered 8 questions correctly and received 2 x 8 = 16 points. Therefore, Luke's total score is 20 + 16 = 36 points.
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points per game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,392 points in 157 games. Therefore, the answer to the question is 22,392 points.
Response:  If Luke got 3 points for each round of the trivia game and he answered correctly in all 10 rounds, then his total score would be:  Luke's total score = Number of correct answers x Points per correct answer = 10 x 3 = 30 points. Since Luke scored 78 points overall, that means he missed some questions or gave incorrect answers in some rounds. So, the number of rounds he answered correctly is: Total number of rounds - Number of rounds with incorrect answers = 10 - X, where X is the number of rounds Luke missed or gave incorrect answers in. Therefore, we can conclude that Luke answered correctly in 9 rounds (10 - X).
Response:  Since there are 5 kuwintas in total, each of them needs to have their own set of beads. So, we need to divide 32 beads among 5 kuwintas. To do this, we can divide 32 by 5 = 6.4 beads per kuwinta. Therefore, each kuwinta needs approximately 6.4 beads.
"Response:  If Emily made 11 necklaces with 28 beads each, then she has used a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of beads} = 11 \times 28 = 308 $$
So, there are 308 beads in total that Emily has."
Response:  If each kuwintas has 8 beads and Emily has 16 beads, then we can say that she has twice as many beads as a single kuwintas. So, if one kuwintas has 8 beads, then Emily has 2 x 8 = 16 beads. Therefore, there are 16 kuwintas that Emily can make with her 16 beads.
Response:  Since there are 18 kuwintas in total and each kuwintas needs 6 beads, we can calculate the number of beads needed as follows:  Number of beads needed = Total number of kuwintas x Number of beads required per kuwintas  Number of beads needed = 18 x 6  Number of beads needed = 108 beads
"Response:  If Emily makes 4 cuwints and each cuwint takes 5 mansanas to complete, then...

1. The total number of mansanas needed for all 4 cuwints is 4 x 5 = 20 mansanas.
2. Since Emily has only made 4 cuwints, she does not have enough time to make all 4 cuwints. Therefore, the number of beads that Emily has is less than or equal to 20.
3. So, the answer is between 0 and 20 inclusive."
Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend gets one bead necklace from her, then she needs to make 72 x 3 = 216 bead necklaces in total. So, Emily can make 216 bead necklaces.
Response:  If there are 43 friends and each friend needs 5 beads for their necklace, then we need to calculate how many beads Emily has made in total. We know that she has already made 20 necklaces, so let's add that number to the total amount of beads needed: Total beads needed = Number of friends x Number of beads per friend = 43 x 5 = 215 Beads So, Emily has made 20 necklaces out of the total 215 beads needed.
Response:  If Emily is making bead necklaces for her 44 friends and each necklace has 26 beads (with each bead having 2 beads), then we can calculate how many beads Emily will have in total as follows:  Total number of beads = Number of necklaces x Number of beads per necklace  = 44 x 26  = 1104 beads So, there are 1104 beads that Emily will have in total if she makes one bead necklace for each of her 44 friends.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 students from Lawrence County who went to camp and 668278 students who stayed at home. To find out how many more students stayed at home than those who went to camp, we can subtract the number of students who went to camp from the total number of students staying at home:  Subtracting 668278 from 819058 gives us 150773. So, there are 150773 more students who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 202958 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 777622 children who stayed home. To find out how many more children stayed home than went to camp, we can subtract these two numbers: 202958 - 777622 = -574830. So, there are 574830 more children who stayed home than went to camp.
Response:  The total number of children who went to camp is 898051 and the remaining 629424 stayed at home. So, the number of children staying at home is 629424 - 898051 = 278530. Therefore, there are 278530 children staying at home.
Response:  The population of Lawrence is 313,473 and during summer break, 274,865 children are at home while only 40,608 go to camp. So, the number of children who go to camp during summer break is:  Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Children at home during summer break = 274,865 - 313,473 = -40,608  Therefore, there are -40,608 children who go to camp during summer break in Lawrence.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there is one child aged 907611 who lives in the province of Lawrence and another child aged 455682 who goes to camp.  We need to find out how many children are in the province of Lawrence.  To do this, we can use the information provided in the question that there are 455682 children who go to camp and subtract it from the total number of children living in the province of Lawrence. Therefore, the number of children living in the province of Lawrence is equal to 907611 minus 455682, which gives us 451939 children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 800059 children who went to camp from the province of Lawrence. Then, we need to find out how many of them stayed in the house. To do this, we divide the number of children who went to camp by the total population of children in the province (which is 828521). So, if we divide 800059 by 828521, we get... (insert calculation)...and the result is approximately 96%. Therefore, about 96% or nearly 100,000 children stayed in their houses during the summer break.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 61619 children in the province of Lawrence who are currently on summer vacation and staying at home. Next, we learn that a total of 91676 children from Lawrence County go to camp. Therefore, the number of children from Lawrence County who go to camp is equal to the total number of children in the province minus the number of children who are on summer vacation and staying at home. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows: Number of children from Lawrence County who go to camp = Total number of children in the province - Number of children who are on summer vacation and staying at home Substituting the given values, we get: Number of children from Lawrence County who go to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Thus, there are approximately 30,006 children from Lawrence County who go to camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 34044 children who went to camp from Lawrence County and 134867 children who stayed at home. So, in total, there were 47501 children from Lawrence County. Now, let's consider the additional 424944 children who came from outside the province. Therefore, the total number of children who attended the camp can be calculated as follows: Total = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside the province = 47501 + 424944 = 470005 children attended the camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 610769 children who went to school from Lawrence County and another 590796 children who stayed at home. So, in total, there are 610769 + 590796 = 1201565 children in Lawrence County. Now, an additional 22 children came from outside the province, so the total number of children in Lawrence County is now 1201565 + 22 = 1201587 children. Therefore, the answer is 1201587.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 644997 students from Lawrence County who went to camp and 893835 students who came from other places. So, in total, there are 644997 + 893835 = 1538232 students who attended the camp. Now, let's find out how many students were from Lawrence County. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who came from other places (893835) from the total number of students who attended the camp (1538232). Therefore, the number of students from Lawrence County is 1538232 - 893835 = 644397.
Response:  If Adam has more than three times as many apples as Jackie, and Adam has 9 apples, then Jackie has 9 / 3 = 3 apples. So, Jackie has 3 apples.
Response:  If Adam has 10 mangoes and each mango weighs 1 kg, then Adam has a total of 10 kg of mangoes.  On the other hand, if Jackie has 2 mangoes and each mango weighs 1 kg, then Jackie has a total of 2 kg of mangoes.  Therefore, Adam has more mangoes than Jackie - 10 kg vs 2 kg.
Response:  Mansanas = 9 (Adam) + 10 (Jackie) = 19. So, Jackie has more mansanas than Adam. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  If Jackie has 10 mangoes and Adam has 8 mangoes, then we can say that Jackie has 2 more mangoes than Adam (10 - 8 = 2). So, Jackie has 2 more mangoes than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 mangoes in total. If we subtract the number of mangoes they share (4), then we are left with 2 mangoes that only belong to Adam. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 7 mangoes in common between them, then they must have had a total of 14 mangoes (7 + 7). So, there are 7 more mangoes that Adam has than Jackie does.
Response:  We know that Adam has 12 mangos and Jackie has 9 more than Adam. So, Jackie has 9 + 12 = 21 mangos in total. Now, we are asked how many mangos Adam has. Since Adam has fewer mangos than Jackie, Adam has 8 less than 21, which is equal to 21 - 8 = 13 mangos. Therefore, there are 13 mangos in total.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more mangoes than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 10 mangoes, then Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 mangoes. Now, we are told that Adam and Jackie together have 2 mangoes less than the total number of mangoes among them. So, the total number of mangoes among them is 14 - 2 = 12 mangoes. Therefore, Adam has 12 mangoes.
Response:  We know that Jackie has 89 jerseys and 11 mansanas. If we assume that each mansana is equal to 10 jerseys (which might not be true), then Jackie has 890 jerseys in total. Now, let's compare this number with Adam's collection. According to the question, Adam has more mansanas than Jackie. So, if Adam has x mansanas, then he must have fewer jerseys than Jackie. Therefore, the answer is x < 890.
Response:  If Helen and her friends are preparing for Thanksgiving at Helen's house, then we know that Helen made 31 cookies yesterday (Monday) and 270 cookies this morning (Tuesday). So, in total, Helen made 301 cookies (31 + 270). However, the question asks how many cookies Helen made until Tuesday, so we need to subtract the number of cookies she made on Monday from the total number of cookies she made. Therefore, the answer is: 301 - 31 = 270 cookies.
Response:  If Helen made 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 raisin cookies yesterday, then she has made a total of 90 + 51 = 141 cookies so far.  If she is making 484 more chocolate chip cookies today, that brings her total to 141 + 484 = 625 cookies. So, Helen has made a total of 625 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  If Helen made 527 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and she is making 86 more today, then the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helen has made so far is: 527 + 86 = 613.
Response:  According to the question, Helen made 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 raisin cookies yesterday (kahapon). Then she made 85 more raisin cookies today (kaninang umaga). So, in total, Helen made 229 raisin cookies today (85 + 144). Therefore, the number of raisin cookies that Helen made is 229.
Response:  According to the question, Helen made 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 237 today. So, in total, she has made 256 chocolate chip cookies (19 + 237). Now, let's compare this number with the number of raisin cookies mentioned in the question - 231. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies made by Helen and the number of raisin cookies is 256 - 231 = 25.
Response:  Yesterday (kahapon), Helen made 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies. Today (kaninang umaga), she made 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies. So, the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies made yesterday and today is:  75 - 197 = -122 Cookies. Therefore, Helen made fewer chocolate chip cookies yesterday than today.
"Response:  According to the question, Helen made 519 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 300 raisin cookies yesterday. Today, she made 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies. So, the difference between the number of raisin cookies made yesterday and today is:  
Difference = Number of raisin cookies made today - Number of raisin cookies made yesterday = 280 - 300 = -20 raisin cookies. Therefore, there are 20 fewer raisin cookies made today compared to yesterday."
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games in total. So, we can calculate how many more games Katie has than her friends as follows:  Number of games owned by Katie - Number of games owned by friends = Total number of games owned by Katie 81 - 59 = 22  Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.
Response:  If Katie has 91 DS games and her new friends have 88 games, then the total number of games among all their friends is: 91 + 88 = 179.  Now, if we subtract the number of games that Katie's old friends have (53), we get: 179 - 53 = 126. Therefore, there are 126 games among all Katie's friends.
Response:  If Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 86 old games, then together they have 164 games (78 + 86). Now, if each of their friends has 48 new games, then the total number of new games among all of them is 48 x 3 = 144. So, there are 20 more new games than old games among Katie and her friends (164 - 144 = 20).
Response:  If Katie has 84 new games and her friends have 8 new games, then together they have 92 new games (84 + 8).  If Katie's friends also have 69 old games, then the total number of games they have is 92 + 69 = 161. So, there are 79 more new games than old games among Katie and her friends (161 - 83 = 79).
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and her friends have 73 new games. So, in total, they have 62 + 73 = 135 new games. Now, we need to find out how many old games they have. According to the question, Katie's friends have 41 old games. Therefore, the number of old games owned by Katie is 135 - 41 = 94 old games.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 57 board game titles and her friends have 63 DS games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of DS games from the total number of board games owned by Katie. So, 57 - 63 = -6. Therefore, Katie has 6 fewer games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, in total, they both have 91 new games (Katie + Friends). Now, let's compare how many old games each of them has: Katie has 39 old games while her friends have 34 old games. Therefore, there are more old games belonging to Katie than her friends. The difference between their number of old games is 39 - 34 = 5. So, there are 5 more old games belonging to Katie compared to her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and Jason had $19 last weekend. So, in total, they have $89 ($60 + $19). Now, after washing cars over the weekend, Jason earned an additional $33, so his new amount is $122 ($89 + $33). Therefore, the money made by Jason from washing cars is $122 - $89 = $33.
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and worked over the weekend, so he earned an additional $13 = $86 + $13. 
Jason did not work today, so he has the same amount of money as last week, which is $5. Therefore, their combined earnings today are $13 + $5 = $18."
Response:  If Fred had $19 last week and earned $40 this weekend, then his total earnings this week are:  $19 + $40 = $59. So, Fred earned $59 this weekend.
"Response: 
Fred had $114 last week and earned $21 today, so his new balance is $135 ($114 + $21).
Jason had $22 last week and earned $78 today, so his new balance is $90 ($22 + $78).
Therefore, Jason earned $68 during the weekend ($78 - $22)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $111 last week and $115 today. So his total earnings for this week are:  $111 + $115 = $226. Now, let's check how much Jason earned. According to the passage, he earned $40 last week and $44 today. Therefore, his total earnings for this week are: $40 + $44 = $84.  So, the difference in their earnings is: $226 - $84 = $142.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred earned $49 last week and $112 today. So his total earnings for this week are:  $49 + $112 = $161. Now, let's find out how much money Jason earned. According to the passage, he worked over the weekend and earned $63 today. Therefore, his total earnings for this week are: $63 + $0 (since he didn't work yesterday) = $63. Thus, the difference in their earnings is: $161 - $63 = $98.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $78 last week and earned $14 this week, so his current balance is $78 + $14 = $92. Now, let's check what happened to Jason. According to the passage, he earned $14 yesterday, which means his new balance is $31 + $14 = $45. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both Fred and Jason this week is $92 (Fred) + $45 (Jason) = $137.
"Response: 
Fred earned $33 per day and Jason earned $95 per day. In total, Fred earned $33 x 2 = $66 for the two days, while Jason earned $95 x 2 = $190 for the two days. So, Fred earned $66 in the weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and earned $111 in newspapers and $34 in car washes. So his total earnings for the week are:  $111 + $34 = $145. Now, let's check how much money Fred has today. Since he earned $145 last week and it is already Friday (the day of the question), then today Fred has:  $145 - ($47 x 3) = $108. Therefore, the amount of money Fred has today is $108.
Response:  If Jesse weighs 71 kg and loses 20 kg after jogging every day for a week, then his current weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg So, Jesse's current weight is 51 kg.
Response:  If Jesse weighs 27 kg before jogging every day and loses 101 kg after jogging for some time, then his weight gain before jogging can be calculated as follows:  Weight gain = New weight - Original weight = 101 kg - 27 kg = 74 kg So, Jesse gained 74 kg in weight before starting to jog.
Response:  Before she started jogging regularly, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After several months of regular jogging, her weight decreased to 66 kg. So, the difference in her weight before and after starting jogging is: 126 - 66 = 60 kg. Therefore, Jessie gained 60 kg before she started jogging.
Response:  Before starting jogging, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After jogging every day for a week, she lost 35 kg or 1/2 of her original weight. So now, if we divide 69 kg by 2, we get 34.5 kg as her current weight. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 34.5 kg.
Response:  If Jessie weighed 114 kg initially and lost 50 kg in the first week, then her weight after one week is 114 - 50 = 64 kg. Similarly, if she lost another 60 kg in the second week, then her current weight is 64 - 60 = 44 kg. So, Jessie's current weight is 44 kg.
Response:  If Jesse weighed 9 kg before he started jogging every day and lost 62 kg in the first week and 140 kg in the second week, then his weight before starting to jog was: 9 + (62 - 7) = 9 + 55 = 64 kg  So, Jesse's weight before starting to jog was 64 kg.
Response:  First day of jogging = 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg lost Second day of jogging = 99 kg - 36 kg = 63 kg gained So, after two days of jogging, Jessie's weight is 63 kg + 36 kg = 99 kg. Therefore, the weight loss per day is 36 kg.
Response:  If there are 95 cats and 61 snakes in the zoo, then the number of snakes that are not hiding is 61 - 34 = 27.
Response:  If there are 93 cobras and 97 snakes that hide, then there are also other snakes that do not hide. So, if we subtract the number of hiding snakes (93 + 97 = 190) from the total number of snakes (190 - 40 = 150). Therefore, there are 150 non-hiding snakes.
Response:  We know that there are 3 tigers and 75 snakes in the zoo. If we subtract the number of tigers from the total number of animals, we get:  Number of snakes = Total number of animals - Number of tigers = 75 - 3 = 72. So, there are 72 snakes in the zoo that are not hiding. Now, let's find out how many snakes are hiding. According to the problem, if 82 snakes are hiding, then the total number of snakes in the zoo is:  Total number of snakes = Number of snakes hiding + Number of snakes not hiding = 82 + 72 = 154. Therefore, there are 154 snakes hiding in the zoo.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the zoo and we have to find out how many of them are not hiding.  From the information given, we can see that there are 24 monkeys and 51 snakes that hide. So, if we subtract these numbers from the total number of animals, we will get the number of animals that are not hiding. Therefore, the answer is:  Animals Not Hiding = Total Number of Animals - Number of Monkeys That Hide - Number of Snakes That Hide  Animals Not Hiding = 79 - 24 - 51 = 34
Response:  If there are 171 tomatoes in the farmer's garden and he chooses 134 of them yesterday, then there are 37 tomatoes left (171 - 134 = 37).  And if he chooses another 30 tomatoes today, then there are only 7 tomatoes left after today (37 - 30 = 7). So, the number of tomatoes that remain after today is 7.
Response:  If there are 160 tomatoes in the farmer's garden and he chooses 56 of them yesterday, then there were 104 tomatoes left in the garden after he made his selection (160 - 56 = 104).  Today, if he chooses 41 more tomatoes from the remaining 104, then there will be 63 tomatoes left in the garden after both selections (104 - 41 = 63). So, the number of tomatoes that the farmer has chosen so far is 56 + 41 = 97.
Response:  If he chose 154 yesterday and 50 today, then the total number of tomatoes he picked = 154 + 50 = 204. So, he picked 204 tomatoes in all.
Response:  If one farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden, and he chooses to sell 172 of them, then we need to calculate how many tomatoes and potatoes are left after selling 172 items.  Tomato calculation: After selling 172 tomatoes, there will be (175 - 172) = 3 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden. Potato calculation: After selling 172 potatoes, there will be (77 - 172) = -95 potatoes left in the farmer's garden. Explanation: In this case, since the farmer sold more than what he had, the number of remaining tomatoes decreases, while the number of remaining potatoes increases but becomes negative because it is less than zero due to rounding errors.
Response:  If one farmer has 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden, then he has a total of 189 produce (177 + 12 = 189).  If he chooses to harvest 53 tomatoes and leaves the remaining 136 tomatoes in the garden, then the number of tomatoes left in the garden is 136 / 53 = 2.45 or approximately 2 tomatoes per day for 30 days. Similarly, if he chooses to harvest 53 potatoes and leaves the remaining 7 potatoes in the garden, then the number of potatoes left in the garden is 7 / 53 = 0.13 or approximately 0.1 potato per day for 30 days.
Response:  If one farmer has 105 berries and 71 pulas in his garden, that means he has a total of 176 fruits (105 berries + 71 pulas). To find out how many more berries he needs to plant to have 137 berries in total, we can subtract the number of berries he already has from the desired total number of berries: 137 - 176 = -49. So, the farmer needs to plant 49 more berries to reach his target of 137 berries.
Response:  We are given that there are 4 legs of the table and each leg needs to be cut with two pieces of wood to secure it. So in total, we need 8 pieces of wood (2 x 4 = 8). Now, we are also told that John needs these pieces of wood for his hobby, which is making things out of wood. Therefore, he needs 8 pieces of wood.
Response:  According to the problem, for each large table of wood, John needs 17 pieces of coconut shells as additional material to secure and add weight. Since he has 13 large tables of wood, he needs a total of 221 pieces of coconut shells (13 x 17 = 221). However, since he only has 8 small tables of wood, he does not need any more coconut shells for these smaller tables. Therefore, the number of coconut shells that John needs is 221.
Response:  We know that there are 11 pieces of wood to be cut for each large table leg and 3 pieces of wood are needed for each small table leg. So, we need 11 x 3 = 33 pieces of wood for all the legs of the tables in the house. Since John needs an additional 8 pieces of wood for other purposes, he will need a total of 33 + 8 = 41 pieces of wood.
Response:  For the big tables (12 pieces), he needs 15 cups of water to secure them. Since each small table requires 5 cups of water, and there are 10 small tables, he needs a total of 5 x 10 = 50 cups of water for all the tables. So, in total, John needs 15 + 50 = 65 cups of water for securing all the tables in the house.
Response:  We know that for each table of wood, John needs 2 pieces of coconut to secure and use it. Since he wants to make 16 tables, we need to find out how many coconuts he will need in total. So, the number of coconuts needed is:  Number of tables x Required pieces per table = 16 x 2 = 32 coconuts. Therefore, John needs 32 coconuts to make all the tables he wants.
Response:  We are given that there are 8 large tables of wood needed for the house and each table requires 74 pieces of nails to secure it. So, we need to calculate how many nails John needs in total. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of nails = Total number of tables x Number of pieces of nails per table. In this case, the total number of tables is 8 and the number of pieces of nails per table is 74, so we can plug these values into the formula like this: Number of nails = 8 x 74 = 592 nails. Therefore, John needs 592 nails to secure all 8 large tables of wood for the house.
Response:  We know that for each large table of wood, John needs 12 pieces of coconut to secure it. Since there are 17 small tables, he needs 25 pieces of coconut for all of them. Therefore, in total, John needs 12 x 3 = 36 pieces of coconut and 25 x 3 = 75 pieces of coconut, or 111 pieces of coconut altogether.
Response:  If there are x packages of gum and each package has 3 piramids, then the total number of piramids is 3x. Since there are 42 piramids in each package, we can write an equation as follows: 3x = 42x. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, there are 14 packages of gum that Robin has.
Response:  The total number of packages is 43 and each package has 23 pieces of gum inside. So, in total, there are 43 x 23 = 1005 pieces of gum. Now, we know that Robin added 8 extra pieces of gum to his collection. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is 1005 + 8 = 1013 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that there are 7 packages of gum in total and each package has 5 pieces of gum. So, the total number of pieces of gum is 7 x 5 = 35 pieces of gum. Now, we know that Robin has 6 additional pieces of gum, so the total number of pieces of gum owned by Robin is 35 + 6 = 41 pieces of gum. Therefore, there are 41 packages of gum that have been distributed among all the students in the classroom.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of gum is: 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum. Now, we also know that there are 13 packages of candy and each package contains 4 candies. Therefore, the total number of candies is: 13 x 4 = 52 candies.
Response:  We know that there are 21 packages of gum and 45 packages of candy. If each package contains 9 candies, then we can calculate how many candies Robin has as follows: Total number of candies = Number of packages x Number of candies per package = 21 x 9 = 189 candies So, Robin has 189 candies in total.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of gum and 14 packages of candy. Each package has 6 pieces inside. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:  Number of pieces of gum = 28 x 6 = 168 pieces Number of pieces of candy = 14 x 6 = 84 pieces Therefore, Robin has 168 + 84 = 252 pieces in total.
Response:  The machine can produce 3 t-shirts per minute and produces 6 shirts in total. To find out how many minutes it took to complete the production of all 6 shirts, we need to divide the number of shirts produced by the number of minutes taken to produce each shirt. So, the time taken to produce all 6 shirts = Number of shirts produced / Time taken to produce one shirt x 100 (to convert minutes to hours) = 6 / 3 x 100 = 200 minutes or 3.33 hours. Therefore, the machine takes approximately 3.33 hours to produce 6 shirts.
"Response:  If the machine can produce 4 shirts in one minute and works for 5 minutes, then...

Answer: The machine will be able to produce 20 shirts (4 x 5 = 20)."
Response:  If the machine can produce 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today, then we know that its production rate has increased by 5 times (from 9 to 44). So, if it took 1 minute to make 3 shirts yesterday, then it will take only 20 seconds to make 3 shirts today (since the production rate has increased by a factor of 5). Therefore, the number of minutes worked by the machine yesterday was 60 (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute), while today it worked for 20 seconds.  So, the answer is 60 minutes yesterday and 20 seconds today.
Response:  If one machine can produce 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today, then in total, the machine produced 16 shirts (13 + 3). Now, if this machine can produce 8 shirts per minute, then the time taken to produce all these shirts can be calculated as follows: Time = Number of shirts / Rate of production In this case, Time = 16 shirts / 8 shirts/minute = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine took 2 minutes to produce all 16 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can produce 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today, then in one minute, it can produce 2 shirts. So, the number of minutes that the machine worked today is:  2 x 9 = 18 minutes (yesterday) + 2 x 8 = 16 minutes (today) = 34 minutes.
Response:  If one industrial machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute, then it makes 4 shirts in 2 minutes and 8 shirts in 3 minutes. So, the time taken by the machine to produce all the shirts is:  Time = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts produced per minute  Time = 30 (shirts) / 3 (shirts/minute) = 10 minutes  Therefore, the industrial machine takes 10 minutes to produce all 30 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 shirts in one minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday and 14 minutes today, then we need to calculate how many shirts were produced altogether.  We know that the machine produces 6 shirts per minute, so if it worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it produced 6 x 12 = 72 shirts. Similarly, if it worked for 14 minutes today, it produced 6 x 14 = 84 shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts produced by the machine is 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 shirts in one minute and worked for 5 minutes yesterday, then it produced 6 x 5 = 30 shirts yesterday. And if it works for 12 hours today, then it will produce 12 x 6 = 72 shirts today. So, the number of shirts made by the machine today is 72.
Response:  The game of Ring Toss in Karnival earns twice the amount of money every day for 5 days. So if they earned $165 per day, that means they earned $329 per day.
Response:  The game of Ring Toss in Karnabal earns $144 per day. They are inside Karnabal for 22 days. So, we can calculate their total income as follows: Total Income = Daily Income x Number of Days Inside Karnabal Total Income = $144 x 22 = $3,088 Therefore, they earned $3,088 during their stay in Karnabal.
Response:  The Ring Toss game earns $420 in total over 30 days, and it earns $22 per day. To find out how much the game earned per day, we can divide the total amount earned by the number of days:  $420 / 30 = $14 per day So, the Ring Toss game earned $14 per day.
Response:  First 44 days = $382 x 44 = $16,596 Second 10 days = $374 x 10 = $3,740 Total income = $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336 So, the total amount of money earned by the carnival game operators is $20,336.
Response:  The game of Ring Toss in Karnival earns $120 for the first 20 days and $66 for each of the next 16 days. So, how much money do they earn per day during the entire period of 46 days? To find out, we need to calculate the total amount earned during those 46 days and divide it by the number of days. Therefore, the daily income of the game of Ring Toss in Karnival can be calculated as follows: Total Amount Earned = $120 x 20 + $66 x 16 = $3,920 Daily Income = $3,920 / 46 = $85 per day
Response:  The first 154 days of playing Ring Toss in Karnabal earned $325. In the next 57 days, they earned $114 per day. So, if we calculate their daily earnings for those 57 days, it would be: $325 x 57 = $18,025. Therefore, the total amount earned by the players during the entire period of 57 days in Karnabal is $18,025.
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of biscuits and 4 packs of cakes, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages of snacks. Since each package contains 6 cookies, Lucy bought a total of 14 x 6 = 84 cookies. Therefore, there are 84 cookies in addition to the 4 packs of cakes that Lucy bought.
Response:  If Lucy bought 4 packages of biscuits, and each package contains 22 packets of biscuits, then she bought a total of 4 x 22 = 88 packets of biscuits. Similarly, if she bought 16 packages of chocolates, and each package contains 30 packets of chocolates, then she bought a total of 16 x 30 = 480 packets of chocolates. Finally, if she bought 22 packages of cakes, and each package contains 5 packets of cakes, then she bought a total of 22 x 5 = 110 packets of cakes. Therefore, in total, Lucy bought 88 + 480 + 110 = 778 packets of groceries.
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 packages of biscuits and x packages of cakes, then the total number of packages she bought is 23 + x. Since there are 27 packages of groceries in total, we can set up an equation as follows: 23 + x = 27. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. So, Lucy bought 4 packages of cakes.
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packs of biscuits and 12 packs of cakes, then she bought a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packages of groceries. Since there is a 56 peso difference, that means each package cost an average of 56 / 14 = PHP 380 per package. Therefore, Lucy bought 14 packets of groceries in total.
Response:  We know that there are 5 people in each bus and we have 4 buses. So, the total number of people who can ride each bus is 5 x 4 = 20. Now, since there are 4 buses, the total number of people who can ride all the buses together is 4 x 20 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 people riding the buses today.
Response:  If there are currently 10 people in the bus and 3 get off, then there will be 7 people left inside the bus. So, the number of people who are still inside the bus now is 7.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, one more person got off from the bus and now there are 3 people left inside the bus. So, the number of people who are currently riding the bus is 3.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train (sauna). Now, let's find out how many people are in the train now. We know that 8 of them got off at Pang Tao station (pang tao ang sumakay sa tren), so the number of people left in the train is 11 - 8 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 people in the train now.
"Response:  May 22 is the date of the program and it started at 6:00 am. So, we can assume that the program lasted for 14 hours (from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm). Now, let's calculate the number of people who attended the program based on the following information:

* ""Ilang estudyante ang dumalo sa programa"" means ""How many students attended the program.""
* The word ""katao"" in Tagalog means ""people"" or ""students.""
* In the question, the phrase ""sa programa"" refers back to the previous sentence, which mentions the program on May 22.

So, to answer the question, we need to find out how many students attended the program on May 22. Based on the given information, we can conclude that 676 students attended the program. Here's how we arrived at this answer:

1. Convert the time frame from AM to PM: 6:00 AM = 6 hours
8:00 PM = 8 hours
Total duration of the program = 14 hours
2. Calculate the total number of hours available for attendance: 14 hours - (number of breaks + unforeseen circumstances)
3. Estimate the average attendance rate based on the available hours: Average attendance rate = Total number of hours available / Total number of hours spent attending the program
4. Use the estimated attendance rate to calculate the number of students who attended the program: Number of students who attended the program = Total number of hours available x Average attendance rate
5. Simplify the calculation by dividing both numbers by 100: Number of students who attended the program = (Total number of hours available x Average attendance rate) / 100
Number of students who attended the program = (14 hours x 90%) / 100 = 676 students

Therefore, the answer to the question is 676 students attended the program on May 22."
Response:  May 73 magulang means there are 73 parents who have children enrolled in the program.  May 724 na mag-aaral means there are 724 students currently enrolled in the program. Finally, may 744 guro sa programa means there are 744 teachers working in the program. So, the total number of people who attended the event is: 724 + 744 = 1,468.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many students are in the program. According to the question, there are 521 students enrolled in the program. Now, let's find out how many parents are also involved in the program. The question states that there are 174 parents who are part of the program. To determine the ratio of students to parents, we divide the number of students by the number of parents: Number of students / Number of parents = 521 / 174 = 3.06 Therefore, there are approximately 3.06 times more students than parents in the program.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many people are in the program (May). We know that there are 61 parents and 177 students in the program. So, the total number of people in the program is 61 + 177 = 238. Now, we need to divide this number by the number of people who can fit in the room (Katao). Based on the information given, the room can accommodate 44 people. Therefore, the number of people who can fit in the room is 238 / 44 = 5.4. So, approximately 54 people can fit in the room.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many kilometers long is the kuweba if it starts from the point where they are now and ends at the point where they want to go.  We can use the formula distance = speed x time + initial position to calculate this.  If they travel at an average speed of 919 km/h, it will take them approximately 1307 nautical miles or 2420 kilometers to reach their destination. So, the length of the kuweba is 2420 kilometers.
Response:  The height of the mountain is given as 1218 feet and they are currently at an elevation of 849 feet. To find out how long it will take them to reach the summit, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate Where distance is the remaining height of the mountain (in this case, 369 feet) and rate is the speed at which they are traveling (which is not given in the problem). So, if they are traveling at a constant rate, the time it will take them to reach the summit is: Time = 369 feet /? = x hours where x is the unknown value. Since they have been walking for 5 hours so far, the total time it will take them to reach the summit is: Total Time = 5 hours + x hours = 12 hours Therefore, it will take them 12 hours to reach the summit from their current location.
Response:  If they are currently at 659 meters and their destination is 762 meters away, then the distance between them and their destination can be calculated as follows: Distance = 762 - 659 = 103 meters. So, the distance from where they are now to their destination is approximately 103 meters.
Response:  If Mahilig has 6 dogs and is good at eating them in the water, and Paige takes care of 8 goldfish in one bowl, how many goldfish are missing?  We know that Paige took care of 8 goldfish, but we don't know how many were left after she did so. So, there must be some missing! The correct answer is 8 - 8 = 0. Therefore, no goldfish are missing.
Response:  If there were initially 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in the tank, then the total number of fish was 7 + 12 = 19. Now, if 15 more fish have been added to the tank, the new total number of fish would be 19 + 15 = 34. So, the number of fish that are missing from the initial count is 34 - 19 = 15.
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the tank. The cats are known to eat the goldfish. Now, we have 2 remaining goldfish. So, if we subtract the number of remaining goldfish from the initial number of goldfish, we get:  Number of missing goldfish = Initial number of goldfish - Number of remaining goldfish  Number of missing goldfish = 16 - 2  Number of missing goldfish = 14 Therefore, 14 goldfish are missing.
Response:  If Paige feeds 15 goldfish and 5 of them are eaten by cats, then there are 10 remaining goldfish (15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  The chef made 2 mangos and used 43 of them in total. So, he has 41 remaining mangos (43 - 2 = 41).
Response:  If one chef made 58 pies and used 35 mangoes to make them, then we can calculate how many mangoes are left using simple division. So, the number of remaining mangoes = Total number of mangoes - Number of mangoes used for making pies = 105 - 35 = 70 mangoes. Therefore, there are 70 mangoes left.
Response:  The chef has 40 mangoes and 54 peaches to make pies. After making some pies, he has 39 left. So, if he used all of his mangoes, then he must have used x = 40 / 2 = 20 mangoes in total. Since he also had 54 peaches, he must have used y = 54 - (20 \* 2) = 14 peaches in total. Therefore, the number of mangoes used by the chef is 20 and the number of peaches used is 14.
Response:  If Adam can accommodate 11 action figures per shelf and he has 4 shelves in his room, then he can hold 4 x 11 = 44 action figures on those shelves. However, if we consider that each shelf can only hold up to 11 action figures, then the total number of action figures that Adam can hold on all four shelves is 44 / 11 = 4 shelves worth of action figures or 44 action figures in total. Now, let's move on to the cabinets. If Adam has 40 cabinets in his room, then he can store 40 x 11 = 440 action figures in those cabinets. So, in summary, Adam can hold 44 action figures on his shelves and 440 action figures in his cabinets for a total of 484 action figures that he can collect at any given time.
Response:  If Adam can accommodate 10 action figures in each of his shelves and he has 8 shelves in his room, then the total number of action figures that Adam can accommodate is:  Total Number of Action Figures = Number of Shelves x Capacity per Shelf = 8 x 10 = 80 action figures. Therefore, there are 80 shelves in Adam's room.
Response:  If Adam can accommodate 8 action figures and 10 cabinets per shelf, then he has a total of 32 action figures (8 x 4 = 32). Now, if each shelf can hold 10 cabinets, then there are 32 / 10 = 3.2 shelves that can be placed in his room. So, the number of things that Adam can collect in his moments is 32 action figures + 3.2 shelves = 35.2 things.
Response:  We have 10 hardin and each hardin has 32 bulaklaks. So, we multiply 10 x 32 = 320 bulaklaks in total.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many bamboo stalks are in each bundle. According to the question, there are 53 bundles of bamboo and each bundle contains 181 sticks. Therefore, the total number of bamboo stalks is:  Number of bundles = 53 Bundles per bundle = 181 Stalks per bundle = Total number of stalks =
Response:  We have 141 rice grains in total. Each banga contains 71 grains of rice. Therefore, we can calculate the number of bangs that contain all the rice grains as follows: Number of bangs = Total number of rice grains / Number of rice grains per banga = 141 / 71 = 2 So there are 2 bangs that contain all the 141 rice grains.
Response:  If there are 40 small fish in this area and there are 400 large fish in the vicinity, then the total number of fish is equal to 40 + 400 = 440 fish.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4276 erasers. To divide them into groups of equal size, we need to find out how many groups we can make with 154 members each.
To do this, we can use division. Divide 4502 by 154 = 30. So, we can make 30 groups of Skittles with 154 members each. Now, let's count how many erasers are left over after forming these groups: 4276 - (30 x 154) = 98. Therefore, there are 98 erasers left over after forming 30 groups of Skittles with 154 members each."
Response:  If there are 4950 erasers and each group has an equal number of erasers (i.e., no more than 495), then we can calculate the total number of groups as follows: Total Number of Groups = Total Number of Erasers / Number per Group = 4950 / 495 = 10 Since there are 10 groups in total, each group contains approximately 495 erasers.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 groups of Skittles in total (according to the problem). Since each group can hold up to 8 Skittles, we have:

Number of Skittles per group = Total number of Skittles / Number of groups
= 896 / 8
= 111 Skittles per group

So, there are 111 Skittles in each group."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 270 students in total. Then, each grade has an equal number of students as follows: Grade 1 - 5 students; Grade 2 - 5 students; Grade 3 - 5 students; and so on until Grade 6 with 5 students. Therefore, the total number of students per grade level is:  Total Number of Students = Number of Grades x Number of Students per Grade Level  Total Number of Students = 6 x (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5)  Total Number of Students = 6 x 30 = 180 students. So, there are 180 students in each grade level."
Response:  First, we need to find out how many grades are in the school. According to the question, there are 304 grades in the school. Next, we need to find out how many students are enrolled in each grade level. The question states that there are 75 students per grade level. So, we can now calculate the total number of students in the school as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Grades x Number of Students per Grade Level Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 = 22,500 Therefore, there are approximately 22,500 students in the school.
