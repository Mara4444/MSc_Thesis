Response: 30 hours.
Response: 12 hours
Response: 20 hours.
"Response: 30 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ryan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 6 hours per day studying Chinese. To calculate the total number of days he needs to spend studying English and Chinese to reach his goal of learning both languages in 86 days, we can use the following formula: Total study time = (Goal in days) / (Time spent per day). Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Total study time = (86 days) / (4 hours/day) = 21.5 days for English and Total study time = (86 days) / (6 hours/day) = 14.3 days for Chinese. Since it is not possible to divide by zero, we round up the numbers to the nearest whole number, which gives us 30 days for English and 20 days for Chinese. Therefore, Ryan will need to spend 30 days studying English and 20 days studying Chinese to achieve his goal of learning both languages in 86 days."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 408 students who suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and 42 students who suggest adding pork. Therefore, the total number of students who suggest adding something to the menu is 408 + 42 = 360. However, since some students may have suggested multiple options, the actual number of unique suggestions is higher than 360. To calculate this, we can use the formula: Unique suggestions = Total suggestions - Duplicate suggestions, where duplicate suggestions are counted only once. In this case, the total suggestions are 408 + 42 = 360, so the unique suggestions are 360 - (408 x 42) = 316."
Response:  The number of students who suggested adding pork to the menu is 489.
Response:  There are 185 students who suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 125 students who suggest adding pork to the menu. Therefore, there are 185 + 125 = 310 students in total who recommend adding one of these two food items to the menu.

"Response: 

Option (A) - 324 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu.

Explanation: According to the question, if 324 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu, and there are 374 students who suggest adding pork, then the number of students who suggest adding beef is 128. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
Response:  There are 257 students who suggest adding potatoes to the menu, 120 students who suggest adding pork to the menu, and 97 students who suggest adding tomatoes to the menu.

"Response: 487
Explanation: According to the question, there are 868 female students and 537 male students in the school. If the number of female students is greater than the number of male students by 281 people, then the total number of students in the school must be equal to the sum of the number of male and female students minus the difference between these two numbers. Therefore, the answer is 487."

Response:  There are currently 938 students in this school (706 girls + 222 boys + 418 new students).
Response:  There are currently 902 female students and 811 male students in the school, for a total of 1713 students. After 44 additional females join the school, there will be 902 + 44 = 946 female students and 811 male students, for a total of 1757 students.
Response:  The number of female students in the school is 632, and the number of male students is 410. When 465 additional female students join the school, the total number of female students becomes 1097 (632 + 465), while the total number of male students remains unchanged at 410. Therefore, the ratio of female students to male students in the school is 1097:410 = 2.68.
Response:  There are 509 female students in the school. Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:  * In total, there are 732 students in the school (including both male and female students).  * Among them, 761 are male students.  * Out of the remaining 682 female students, 8 are married to each other, leaving us with 674 single female students. Therefore, the number of female students in the school is 674 + 509 = 1183.
Response:  There are 214 male students and 135 female students in the school initially. When 496 additional females and 910 additional males join the school, there will be 351 more male students than female students (i.e., 214 + 351 = 565). Therefore, there will be 565 male students in the school after the addition of new students.
Response:  There are 344 students in total (308 girls + 318 boys) and 36 teachers.
Response:  There are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school, so together they make up 624 people. Additionally, there are 772 teachers in the school, for a total of 1396 people (624 students + 772 teachers).
"Response: 517
Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the question to find out how many male students there are in the school. According to the question, the number of female students is 739, and for every 4 females, there is 1 male. Therefore, the number of males can be calculated as follows:
Number of males = Number of females x (1/4)
= 739 x (1/4)
= 517
So, there are 517 male students in the school."
"Response: 304
Explanation: According to the question, there are 458 more female students than male students in the school. If there are 692 total female students, then there must be 304 male students in the school."
Response: 195 Step-by-step explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:  Initially, there are 362 male students and 257 female students in the school. Then, 403 additional female students join the school. To find out how many more female students than male students there are now, we need to subtract the number of male students from the total number of female students: Number of female students = 403 + 257 = 660 Number of male students = 362 Therefore, there are 660 - 362 = 298 more female students than male students in the school now.

Response: 58 times.
"Response: 41
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that David did 36 times more forward bends than backbends (36 vs 33). Therefore, if David did 58 forward bends and 33 backbends, then he did 25 more forward bends than backbends (58 - 33 = 25). So, Zachary did 41 forward bends (25 + 16 = 41)."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
According to the question, David did 27 times of forward bending and less than 7 times of backbend. If Zachary did 5 forward bends and 17 backbends, then Zachary's total number of backbends is:
Zachary's backbends = 5 + (17 - 7) = 34
Therefore, Zachary has done 34 backbends in total."

Explanation: According to the question, Jessica took out 34 flowers from the vase and then cut 15 new flowers from the garden to put into the vase. Therefore, there are 7 extra flowers in the vase that were not originally there."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the question, there are seven flowers in the vase initially. Then, Jessica picked more flowers from her garden and added them to the vase, making it a total of 59 flowers. Since there are 20 spaces left empty in the vase, Jessica must have cut off 31 flowers (7 + 59 - 20 = 31)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, there were originally 13 flowers in the vase. Then, Jessica picked more flowers from her garden and added them to the vase, making it have 12 additional flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 13 + 12 = 25 flowers. Since the question asks how many flowers are left in the garden, we subtract the number of flowers that Jessica took (12) from the total number of flowers in the vase (25), resulting in 30 flowers remaining in the garden."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that there are 15 flowers and 62 types of flowers inside the vase. Since Jessica picked more than she put back, let's assume she picked x flowers. Then, since she also added 17 new flowers with 96 orchids, the total number of flowers she cut is:
x + 17 = 62 (flowers)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 23
Therefore, Jessica cut 23 flowers."

Response:  There are 91 flowers in total in the vase, and Jessica picked 27 of them from the garden (including the 13 original ones). So there are 64 remaining flowers in the vase.
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, there are 16 flowers in the vase and 3 lanterns. Since Jessica picked more than she put in, there must be 24 flowers left in the vase after she picked some."

Response:  There are 39 paper bags.
"Response: 35
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Danny has collected 71 bottle caps and 24 pieces of paper labels. Since each bottle cap can be used to cover one bottle, Danny has covered 71 / 1 = 71 bottles.
Since there are 24 pieces of paper labels, each label can be used to cover one bottle. Therefore, the total number of bottles covered by all the labels is 24.
So, the difference between the number of bottles covered by the bottle caps (71) and the number of bottles covered by the paper labels (24) is 71 - 24 = 35."
Response:  There are 10 bottle caps and 62 paper bags in total. Danny has collected 27 bottle caps and 43 paper bags. Therefore, there are 27/10 = 2.7 bottle caps per paper bag, or 43/62 = 0.69 paper bags per bottle cap.

Explanation: According to the question, after Danli collected 32 caps in the park, he had 25 caps before going to the park. Therefore, the number of caps Danli collected while in the park is 32 - 25 = 9."
Response:  Initially, Danny had 32 bottle caps.
"Response: 30
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Danny collected 6 old bottle caps and threw away 6 old bottles. This means he has 6 + 6 = 12 bottle caps left.
Then, he found 50 new bottle caps in the park. So, his total collection of bottle caps is now 12 + 50 = 62 bottle caps.
Therefore, the number of bottle caps Danie picked up from the park is 62 - 6 = 56 bottle caps."

"Response: 50

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Danny has collected 66 paper bags and 39 plastic bottle caps. Since each bag requires 2 bottle caps to seal it, Danny has collected enough bottle caps to seal 66 / 2 = 33 bags. Therefore, the number of packages Danny had at first is 68 - 33 = 35 packages."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Danny collected 46 paper bags and 50 bottle caps in the park. Since each paper bag can hold 52 bottle caps, Danny must have collected at least 39 sets of bottle caps (46 / 52 = 39). Therefore, the answer is 39."
Response:  There are 31 pieces of bottle caps and 9 pieces of paper bags collected by Danny in the park. Therefore, there are 31 + 9 = 40 items collected by Danny in total.
Response: 58 (the number of bottle caps) > 25 (the number of paper bags) = 33 (the difference between the number of bottle caps and paper bags).

"Response: 35
Explanation:
Paco has 12 pieces of cookies and he eats 16 pieces. So, he has 12 - 16 = -4 pieces of cookies left. Then, he gives 21 pieces of cookies to his friends. Since each piece of cookie is equal to 1/4 of a piece, Paco's friends will have 21 x 1/4 = 5.25 pieces of cookies in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies Paco has after giving them away and the number of cookies he originally had is 5.25 - 12 = -6.75 pieces of cookies."

Since Paco eats 18 pieces of candy, he has consumed more than his 9 friends combined, who have only consumed 5 x 9 = 45 pieces of candy in total. So, Paco has consumed 18 - 45 = -27 pieces of candy more than his friends.

"Response:  The number of passengers who boarded the bus at each stop is given by $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_63$. Let $y$ be the number of passengers who got off the bus at any stop. Then we have:

$$y = \sum_{i=1}^{63} x_i$$

Since there are 5 routes, the total number of passengers who boarded the bus is:

$$T = 5 \times y$$

So, the ratio of the number of passengers who got off the bus to the number of passengers who boarded the bus is:

$$\frac{y}{T} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{63} x_i}{\times 5}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{7.2}$."

In this case, Kari has 20 Nintendo games, and she wants to buy 12 more, so she needs to sell 5 Nintendo games first (20 / 12 = 5)."
"Response: 57
Explanation:
To determine how many Sony games Kaitlyn needs to sell to have 31 remaining, we need to subtract the number of Sony games she has (132) from the total number of games she has (46 + 132 = 178). This gives us a difference of 106 games. To find out how many of these are Sony games, we divide the number of Sony games by the difference: 106 / 106 = 1.
Therefore, Kaitlyn needs to sell 57 Sony games to have 31 remaining."
"Response: 29
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Kari has 80 Nintendo games and she has already played 31 of them. To find out how many games Kari needs to trade in order to have 6 remaining games, we can subtract the number of games she has already played from the total number of games she has. Therefore, the answer is 29."

Explanation: According to the question, Randi used 52 street districts to build a tower. If she had 38 street districts left after building the tower, then initially, she had 40 street districts."
Response: 36
Response: 36 streets are left after using 14 streets to build a tower and 11 streets to build a house.
"Response: 49
Explanation:
Randy has 58 street districts and uses 27 of them to build one skyscraper. Therefore, he has 58 - 27 = 31 remaining street districts.
He then uses 53 of these remaining street districts to build another building, which means he has used up all of his available street districts.
So, the number of blocks of Lego bricks that Randy can use to build both buildings is 31 / 6 (since each block represents 6 street districts) = 5."
Response:  Randy has 37 districts and uses 33 blocks of wooden bricks to build a large building with 13 blocks of wooden bricks to build a small house. To build this tower, he needs how many more blocks of wood than he used for the small house?  Solution: Let X be the number of blocks of wood needed to build the tower. Since Randy used 33 blocks of wood to build the large building, we can say that X - 33 = number of blocks of wood needed to build the tower. Therefore, the answer is X = 40.
Response:  Randy has 86 districts and uses 79 pieces of land to build a skyscraper and 82 pieces of land to build a house. To build this house, he uses some blocks of wood. Therefore, Randy wins by building this house with fewer materials than building the skyscraper.
"Response: 23

Explanation:
Randy has 36 street districts to build a tower and he uses all of them. If he had 59 street districts, he would have 23 more street districts left over after building the tower."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Randi has 95 street districts.
* He uses 20 street districts to build a house.
* The remaining 75 street districts are used to build a tower.
* To build the tower, Randi needs 30 blocks of Lego bricks.

Now, let's calculate the number of blocks needed to build the house:

Number of blocks needed for the house = Number of street districts used for the house / Total number of street districts
= 20 / 95
= 0.21 (or 21%)

Since Randi needs 30 blocks to build the tower, and he uses 21% of the total number of street districts to build the house, we can conclude that Randi needs 30 x 21% = 6.3 blocks to build the tower.

Therefore, the answer is 16 (the sum of the number of blocks needed for the house and the tower)."
"Response: 11
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Randi has used 89 street districts to build a house and 63 street districts to build a tower. Therefore, the total number of street districts used by Randi is 89 + 63 = 152.
Since there are 100 pieces of wood available for building, Randi can use at most 100 / 152 = 0.67 or approximately 67 pieces of wood to build both the house and the tower.
Therefore, Randi uses more wood to build the tower than the house, so the answer is 11 (the difference between 67 and 56)."

Response: 4
"Response: 36
Explanation:
The series has 15 books and 14 movies. If you have read 11 books, that means you have not watched any of the movies. Therefore, the number of books read is 11, and the number of movies watched is 0. So, the difference between the number of books read and movies watched is 36 (11 - 0)."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
The series has 17 movies and 11 books. If you have read 13 books, that means you have seen 13 x 63 = 809 movies. Therefore, the number of movies watched is 809 - 40 = 769."

Response:  The number of trees that died as a result of Typhoon Hato is estimated to be around 30% more than the original 14 trees planted by Haley in the aftermath of Typhoon Nine.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, there were 13 trees that survived the typhoon after being planted in the hospital courtyard. After the typhoon, 50% of the remaining trees (6.5 x 13 = 81) survived. Therefore, the answer is 81.
Response: 4/20 = 1/5
Response:  If there are currently 12 tree stumps left after Typhoon Five, and each stump can grow into multiple trees, then the number of new trees that will grow from those stumps is impossible to determine with certainty as it depends on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, and genetic makeup of the trees. However, we can estimate the range of possible outcomes based on some assumptions. Let's assume that each stump has an average chance of growing into 3-5 new trees, depending on the above factors. Under this assumption, if there were initially 12 tree stumps, there could potentially be between 36 (12 x 3) and 60 (12 x 5) new trees grown from those stumps in the future.
Response:  After Haley planted nine trees in the hospital courtyard after Typhoon Four, she then planted five more trees. Therefore, there are 4 (9 - 5) trees left.
Response: 5 trees.
Response:  If initially 3 trees were planted and all but 10 of them died during the typhoon, then there are 7 remaining trees.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the question, there are 2 trees that survived the typhoon and have grown to be 3 times their original height after 5 years. Therefore, the answer is 6 (3 x 2 = 6).

* ""然後丟 64 個袋"" means that after collecting 76 bags, they throw away 64 bags.
* ""如果每個袋子有 50 個子"" means that each bag contains 50 fruits.
Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits collected per day:
Total number of fruits = Number of bags collected x Number of fruits in each bag
= 76 x 50
= 3800
So, the person collects 3800 fruits per day."
"Response: 304
Explanation:
According to the question, every day, there are 28 mature fruit and 52 immature fruit that can be harvested. Since the experiment lasts for 26 days, in total, there will be:

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if each T-shirt is sold for $62 at the store in Arkansas and $99 at the store in Tennessee, then the total number of T-shirts sold at both stores combined is 183 + 31 = 214. Therefore, the number of T-shirts sold by the vendor during the competition period in Arkansas is 214 / 2 = 107."
"Response:  $156 x 74 = $11,320$

Explanation:
The cost of each T-shirt is $67, and the cost of each pair of pants is $165. During the competition in Arkansas and Texas, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 pairs of pants. Therefore, the total revenue from selling these clothes is $67 x 74 = $4,980 + $165 x 156 = $26,440."
"Response:  $63$

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The price of each T-shirt at the store in Arkansas is $192.
* The price of each T-shirt at the store in Texas during the technology fair is $34.
* A total of 157 T-shirts and 19 hoodies were sold during the fair.

Now, let's calculate the difference in price between the two stores for each item:

For T-shirts:
Arkansas price = $192
Texas price = $34
Difference = $158 ($192 - $34)

For hoodies:
Arkansas price = $0 (since there are no hoodies sold at the Arkansas store)
Texas price = $34
Difference = $34 ($34 - $0)

Now, to find out how much one T-shirt costs more than another, we need to subtract the prices of the two items:

For example, if you want to know how much one T-shirt from Arkansas costs compared to one from Texas, you would subtract their differences:

Arkansas difference = $158
Texas difference = $34
Cost comparison = $124 ($158 - $34)

Therefore, based on the information provided, one T-shirt from Arkansas costs around $124 more than one from Texas."
"Response:  $10$

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that each T-shirt is sold for $86 and each hoodie is sold for $232. During the competition period in Arkansas, 254 T-shirts and 43 hoodies were sold. Therefore, the price of one hoodie is $232 / 43 = $5.36 more than the price of one T-shirt. So, one hoodie costs $86 + ($5.36) = $91.36 more than one T-shirt."

* A total of 158 T-shirts and 2 baseball shirts were sold.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money earned from selling these items:
Total amount of money earned = Number of T-shirts x Price of each T-shirt + Number of baseball shirts x Price of each baseball shirt
= 158 x $204 + 2 x $76
= $139,600

Therefore, the answer to the question is $139,600."

Response:  $13.20 per week.
Response: 70 weeks (or approximately 1 year and 4 months)
"Response:  $34865.92

Explanation:

From the question, we know that the person earns $260 per week and pays $702 in taxes every year. To calculate how much money the person will have at the end of the year, we can use the following formula:

Total amount earned = Number of weeks worked x Earnings per week
Total amount paid in taxes = Tax rate x Total amount earned

Using these formulas, we can plug in the values given in the question to get:

Total amount earned = 52 x $260 = $13,320
Total amount paid in taxes = 25% x $13,320 = $3,328

So, the person will have $10,002 ($13,320 - $3,328) left after paying their taxes."
"Response:  $40,698

Explanation:
If Easy can work for 73 pay periods in a year and earn an average of $1357 per week, then their total annual income would be:

Total annual income = Number of pay periods x Average weekly income
= 73 x $1357
= $96,351

So, if Easy works for all 223 weeks in a year, they will earn approximately $40,698 more than their annual income."
Response:  Louis earns $28 per hour and works 40 hours per week. Therefore, his weekly income is $28 x 40 = $1120. If he works overtime every week, his weekly income will be $1120 + ($939 x number of overtime weeks) = $1120 + $939 x n, where n is the number of overtime weeks. So, if he works overtime for 10 additional weeks, his total weekly income will be $1120 + $939 x 10 = $12590.
"Response:  $106,572.

Explanation:
If there are 233 weeks in a year and each week has $49 rent, then the total rent for one year is:

$49 x 233 = $10,897

So, if the person earns $106,572 in a year, they will have $95,675 left after paying the rent."
"Response:  $2047.
Explanation:
Louis pays $388 per week in rent, which is equivalent to $16,676 per year ($388 x 52 weeks). Since he receives $1359 every week, his total annual income is $66,764 ($1359 x 52 weeks). Therefore, the difference between his income and expenses is $49,988 ($66,764 - $16,676)."
"Response:  Louis earns $491 per week and his income is expected to last for 1181 weeks. If he pays $216 in rent every week, how much money will he have left after paying rent for 1181 weeks?

Solution:
Let X be the amount of money Louis has left after paying rent for 1181 weeks.

According to the problem statement, Louis's income is $491 per week, so he has earned a total of:

$$ \text {Total income} = 491 \times 1181 = 573,059 $$

However, he pays $216 in rent every week, so he has spent a total of:

$$ \text {Total rent paid} = 216 \times 1181 = 250,966 $$

Therefore, the amount of money Louis has left after paying rent for 1181 weeks is:

$$ \boxed{X = 573,059 - 250,966 = 322,093} $$"

Response:  There are 36 types of flowers and each flower has 12 seeds inside it. Only 58 seeds grew into flowers, so there are 58/36 = 1.67 flowers per seed. Therefore, there are approximately 1.67 x 36 = 59.44 flowers in total.
Response:  The probability of any one seed germinating and growing into a flower is 1/3 or 33%. Therefore, the probability of all 60 seeds germinating and growing into flowers is (1/3)^60 = 1/2^48 = 1/64. So there will be approximately 64 flowers grown from the 60 seeds planted.
Response:  The number of flowers that will grow from 10 seeds planted in each flower bed is 60 / 10 = 6.
"Response:  The number of seeds planted in each pot is equal to 8, and there are 32 different species of flowers. If each pot contains an equal number of seeds for all species, then the number of seeds planted in each pot is:

Response: 36 seats per bus. Explanation: According to the question, there are 98 students and 7 school buses. If all the buses are full (i.e., each bus has its maximum capacity), then the total number of seats available is 98 students x 7 buses = 696 seats. Since each seat takes up space, we can assume that each bus has approximately 36 seats (based on the average size of a school bus). Therefore, the answer is 36 seats per bus.
Response:  The number of students in this school is 84 x 95 = 8020.
"Response: 12 cars are needed for this field trip. Explanation:

From the given information, we know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students, making a total of 4592 students (67 x 66 = 4592). Since each car can accommodate 6 passengers, we need at least 760 cars (4592 / 6 = 760) to transport all the students. However, since each car can only hold 6 passengers, we actually need 12 cars (760 / 6 = 12) for this field trip."
"Response: 43
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The school has 87 classrooms.
* There are 58 students per class.
* Each bus can accommodate 2 students.

Now, let's calculate the number of buses needed for the field trip:
Number of buses = Number of students / Seating capacity per bus
= 58 x 2 (students per bus) / 2 (seats per bus)
= 116 / 2
= 58

So, the school needs 58 buses for the field trip."
Response:  There are 120 students in total and each class has 30 students, so there are 4 classes in total. Therefore, the number of students per school bus seat is 84 / 4 = 21 students per seat.
Response: 35 cars are needed to accommodate all 102 students who do not want to attend class if 22 students do not want to go to class.
Response: 46 students will attend the field trip. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 102 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 35 students on average. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 102 x 35 = 3550. Since eight students do not want to go on the field trip, the number of students who will attend the field trip is 3550 - 8 = 3542.
Response: 40 buses are needed to transport all 111 students to school. Explanation: Let's assume that each student needs one seat in the bus. Since there are 72 classrooms and each classroom has 3 seats per bus, we need 72 x 3 = 216 seats in total. Therefore, 216 / 111 = 40 buses are required to transport all the students to school.
Response:  Each bus has approximately 2 seats per student, so there are 92 students / 2 seats/bus = 46 buses.

Response: 4 pages per day
Response: 10 days  
Response: 270 pages per day (or 30 days \* 9 pages/day)
"Response: 312 pages
Explanation:
If Frank took 607 days to complete the book with three chapters and each chapter has 594 pages, then we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Chapter 1: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 0.95 pages per day
Chapter 2: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 0.95 pages per day
Chapter 3: 594 pages / 607 days = approximately 0.95 pages per day
Since there are three chapters, the total number of pages in the book is:
Total pages = Chapter 1 pages + Chapter 2 pages + Chapter 3 pages
= 0.95 x 594 + 0.95 x 594 + 0.95 x 594
= 312 pages
Therefore, the answer is 312 pages."
"Response: 21
Explanation:

"Response: 43
Explanation: According to the question, there are 67 bottles of regular gasoline and 9 bottles of lightweight gasoline. Since lightweight gasoline is less dense than regular gasoline, we can infer that the volume of lightweight gasoline in each bottle is smaller than that of regular gasoline. Therefore, the total volume of all gasoline in the store is:

Total volume = Volume of regular gasoline + Volume of lightweight gasoline
= 67 x (volume of one regular gasoline bottle) + 9 x (volume of one lightweight gasoline bottle)

Since the volume of one regular gasoline bottle is given as 0.5 liters, and the volume of one lightweight gasoline bottle is half that amount (since it is ""輕""), we have:

Volume of regular gasoline = 67 x 0.5 liters = 33.5 liters
Volume of lightweight gasoline = 9 x 0.25 liters = 2.25 liters

Therefore, the total volume of gasoline in the store is:

Total volume = 33.5 liters + 2.25 liters = 35.75 liters
So, there are approximately 43 bottles of gasoline in the store (rounded to the nearest whole number)."

Response: 30
"Response: 31/2
Explanation:
According to the question, there are 19 bottles of light beer and 60 bottles of regular beer in total. Since light beer is heavier than regular beer, we can calculate the number of bottles of light beer as follows:
Number of bottles of light beer = Total number of bottles / Weight of one bottle of light beer
Weight of one bottle of light beer = Weight of one bottle of regular beer x Fraction of weight of light beer relative to regular beer
Fraction of weight of light beer relative to regular beer = (Weight of one bottle of light beer / Weight of one bottle of regular beer)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of bottles of light beer = 19 / (5 kg / 0.8 kg) = 31/2
Therefore, there are 31/2 bottles of light beer in the store."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, there are 72 bottles of regular gasoline and 32 bottles of lightweight gasoline in the store. There are also 78 fruits in stock. To determine how many more than one fruit there are, we need to divide the number of fruits by the number of bottles of lightweight gasoline. Therefore, there are 40 more fruits than one fruit."
"Response: 42
Explanation:
The store has 36 fruits and 80 bottles of regular gasoline. Since each fruit takes up 1 slot, there are 36 slots available for other items. Therefore, the number of bottles that can be stored in addition to one fruit is 80 - 36 = 44. However, since we are asked how many more than one fruit, the answer is 44 + 1 = 45."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, there are 30 bottles of water in total, with 28 being regular and 3 being lightweight. Therefore, the number of lightweight bottles is 3 / 30 = 0.1 (or 10%). So, the number of lightweight bottles is 10%."

Response:  Joe needs 8 wood planks to build the wall. Explanation: According to the question, each wooden board requires two nails to be fixed onto the wall. Since there are four nails used for each wooden board, Joe needs to fix 4 x 2 = 8 wooden boards to the wall.
"Response: 35
Explanation:
From the question, we know that John needs to use 13 pieces of large wooden planks to construct the wall. Each piece of wood requires 17 nails for fixing. Therefore, the total number of nails needed is 13 x 17 = 201 nails. However, there are also some small wooden boards that need 8 nails each, which adds up to another 8 nails. So, in total, John needs 209 nails (201 + 8) to fix all the wooden planks and boards onto the wall."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, John used 11 nails to attach 4 large wooden planks to the wall. If each wooden plank requires 3 nails for attachment, then John needs 5 wooden planks (4 x 3 = 12). Additionally, there are 8 extra nails left over, which means that John has enough nails to attach 5 wooden planks. Therefore, the answer is 5."
Response: 20
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the question, each wooden board requires two nails for fixing. Since John used 16 wooden boards, he needs 8 nails in total to fix them all."
"Response: 120
Explanation:
If each wooden board needs 74 nails to be fixed, and there are 8 boards in total, then the number of nails needed is 8 x 74 = 592. Since there are 120 nails given in the problem, we can conclude that there are not enough nails to fix all 8 boards, so only 120 boards can be used for the wall."
Response: 360 wood planks are needed to build the wall. Explanation: According to the question, there are 12 large wooden boards and 17 small wooden boards that need to be fixed with nails. To calculate the total number of wood planks needed, we can assume that each large board requires 14 nails and each small board requires 25 nails. Therefore, the total number of wood planks needed is: 12 x 14 = 168 large boards + 17 x 25 = 425 small boards = 360 wood planks.

Response:  $3,056.80
"Response:  $15$
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that the game generates $420$ dollars in revenue every day for 30 days. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the game is:

$$ Total Revenue = 420 \times 30 = 12600 $$

Since there are 22 pennies in each dollar, we can calculate the number of pennies generated by the game per day as follows:

$$ Number of Pennies = Total Revenue / (22 \* 100) = 12600 / (22 \* 100) = 578 $$

Therefore, you can earn approximately $578$ pennies per day from the game."
