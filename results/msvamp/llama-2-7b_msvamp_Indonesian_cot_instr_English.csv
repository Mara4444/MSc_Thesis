Response:  If Bobby makes some candy and then eats 25 more, that means he has a total of 25 + x candies where x is the number of candies he made at first. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of candies = 25 + x  Now, we are given that Bobby ate a total of 43 pieces of candy. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation to solve for x:  Number of candies = 25 + x 43 = 25 + x  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation: 20 = x  Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:  X = 4  Therefore, Bobby made 4 pieces of candy at the beginning.;
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 packets of perm... (read more);
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of perm and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, he ate 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of perm. Then, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 37 (perms) + 14 (chocolates) = 51 sweets.;
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 38 keping permen and then he ate 36 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 74 keping permen (38 + 36). Now, we are asked how many permen Bobby ate besides chocolate. Since he also ate 16 keping cokelat, the number of permen he ate besides chocolate is 74 - 16 = 58 keping permen.;
Response:  Firstly, Bobby made 20 pieces of perming. Then he ate 34 more pieces, so the total number of pieces he ate is 20 + 34 = 54. Finally, he ate 18 more pieces, so the total number of pieces he ate is now 54 + 18 = 72. Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 72 pieces of perming.;
Response:  First, Bobby had 21 pieces of perm... (read more);
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. Then he ate some candies and left with 5 remaining. So initially, Bobby had x = 22 pieces of candy. After that, he ate some more candies and was left with 5 pieces. Therefore, the number of candies he ate at first is equal to the number of candies he has now, which is 5. Thus, we can write an equation as follows: x - 5 = 5 or x = 10. So, Bobby initially had 10 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Bobby has 19 keping permen and he eats 2 keping permen, then there are 17 keping permen left (19 - 2 = 17).;
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have less than 32 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces he ate, but let's assume it's x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:  Number of pieces of candy Bobby has = 32 - x (1) Now, we are told that Bobby has 20 pieces of candy left after he finishes eating. So, we can substitute this value into equation (1):  Number of pieces of candy Bobby has = 32 - x = 20 (2) Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 32 from both sides of equation (2): x = 20 - 32 (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: x = -12 (4) Therefore, if Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate some of them, he would have 20 pieces left, which means he ate 12 pieces of candy.;
Response:  If Bobby initially had 36 packets of peppermint candies and he ate 17 packets, then there are 36 - 17 = 19 packets left.  Then, if he ate another 15 packets, there are 19 - 15 = 4 packets remaining. So, there are 4 packets of peppermint candies left.;
Response:  If Bobby has 23 keping permen and he initially had 30 keping permen, then we can deduce that there were originally 7 keping permen left (30 - 23 = 7). So, there are 7 keping permen still remaining after Bobby eats 23 of them.;
Response:  Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. So, in total, they have 5 + 3 = 8 balloons at the park. Therefore, Allan has more balloons than Jake at the park (by 5 - 3 = 2).;
Response:  Allan has 2 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons at the park. So, we can say that Jake has 3 more balloons than Allan at the park. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons owned by Allan and Jake is 3.  So, the answer to the question is 3.;
Response:  If Allan brings 2 balloons to the park and Jake brings 1 balloon, then together they bring 3 balloons to the park. So, the number of balloons brought by Jake is 1.;
Response:  If Jake brings 6 balloons to the park and he brought 4 more than Allan, then we can say that Allan brought x balloons to the park. Since Jake brought 6 - 4 = 2 more balloons than Allan, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 2 = 6. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations.  Therefore, Allan brought 4 balloons to the park.;
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balls to the park and Jake brought 6 more than Allan, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balls to the park. So, Jake brought 11 balls to the park.;
Response:  At first, Allan brought 3 balls to the park and Jake brought 5 balls to the park. So, in total they had 3 + 5 = 8 balls at the park. Then, Allan bought 2 more balls. Therefore, now they have 8 + 2 = 10 balls at the park.;
Response:  At first, Allan has 2 balloons and Jake has 4 balloons, so they have a total of 6 balloons (2 + 4 = 6). Then, Allan buys 3 more balloons in the park, so he now has 5 balloons (2 + 3 = 5). Meanwhile, Jake still has 4 balloons. Therefore, the number of balloons owned by Allan is greater than that of Jake by 1 (5 - 4 = 1). So, the answer to the question is 1.;
Response:  At first, Jake has 6 balloons and Allan has 2 balloons. Then, Allan buys 3 more balloons in the park. So now, Allan has 5 balloons (2 + 3) and Jake still has 6 balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons owned by Jake and Allan is 6 - 5 = 1.;
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and then he bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Allan brought 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park.;
Response:  At first, Allan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 2 balloons. So, the total number of balloons they had together was 6 + 2 = 8. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons owned by both Allan and Jake in the park is now 8 + 3 = 11.  So, the difference between the number of balloons owned by Allan (8) and Jake (11) is 3.;
"Response: 
Allan has 6 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons initially. So, the total number of balloons they have together is 6 + 3 = 9.  Then, Jake buys 4 more balloons in the park. So, now Jake has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons at the park.  Therefore, Jake has 7 balloons more than Allan at the park.";
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and then Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Jake brought 8 balloons (5 + 3) to the park.;
"Response: 
Allen brought 3 balls and 20 balls to the park. So he has a total of 23 balls (3 + 20). 
Jake brought 5 balls and 59 balls to the park. So he has a total of 64 balls (5 + 64). Therefore, Allen and Jake have a total of 87 balls in the park (23 + 64 = 87).";
"Response: 
Allen brought 7 balls and 5 bolas to the park, so he has 7 + 5 = 12 objects in total. 
Jake brought 6 balls and 4 bolas to the park, so he has 6 + 4 = 10 objects in total.  Therefore, Allen and Jake have 12 + 10 = 22 objects at the park.";
Response:  If Allan brings 5 balls to the park and he is with Jake who also brings 5 balls, then together they have brought 10 balls (5 + 5) to the park. So, Jake has brought 4 balls less than Allan to the park (10 - 4 = 6). Therefore, Jake has brought 6 balls to the park.;
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 2 balls to the park and then bought 3 more balls there. So, in total, Allan has 5 balls at the park (2 + 3 = 5). Now, Jake brought 6 balls to the same park. Therefore, the number of balls that Jake had from Allan at the park is equal to the difference between the total number of balls Jake brought and the total number of balls Allan had at the park. In other words, the answer can be calculated as follows: Number of balls Jake had from Allan at the park = Total number of balls Jake brought - Total number of balls Allan had at the park  Number of balls Jake brought = 6  Total number of balls Allan had at the park = 5  Subtracting these two numbers gives us the final answer: Number of balls Jake had from Allan at the park = 6 - 5 = 1  Therefore, Jake had 1 ball from Allan at the park.;
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages. So, let's do that:
Total time studying both languages = Time studying English + Time studying Chinese Total time studying both languages = 6 hours/day + 2 hours/day = 8 hours/day Now, let's find out how many more hours Ryan spends studying English than Chinese: More hours studying English than Chinese = Total time studying English - Total time studying Chinese More hours studying English than Chinese = 8 hours/day - 2 hours/day = 6 hours/day Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day studying English than Chinese.";
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese. So, in this case, Ryan spends 7 - 6 = 1 hour more studying Chinese than English. Therefore, the answer is 1 hour.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours per day studying both languages. So, if he studies Chinese for x hours per day, then we can write an equation as follows: 3 + x = 4 (1) Where x is the number of hours Ryan spends studying Chinese each day. Now, let's solve this equation to find out how many hours Ryan spends studying Chinese. To do this, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 3 + x - 3 = 4 (2) Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 1 (3) Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day studying Chinese.;
Response:  If Ryan spends more than 2 hours learning English than Chinese per day, then we can say that he spends x hours learning English and y hours learning Chinese, where x > 2 and y is a positive integer. Now, we know that Ryan spends 7 hours learning English every day, so the total number of hours he spends learning English in one day is 7x. Similarly, since he spends some time learning Chinese as well, the total number of hours he spends learning Chinese in one day is 7y. Since Ryan spends more than 2 hours learning English than Chinese, we can write an inequality based on the information given in the question: 7x > 7y. Solving for x and y, we get:  x = 4 and y = 3. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 3 hours learning Chinese every day.;
Response:  If Ryan spends more than 2 hours learning English than Chinese per day, then we can say that he spends x hours learning English and y hours learning Chinese, where x > 2. Now, we know that Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese every day, so the total time he spends learning both languages is 5 + (y - 2) = 7 hours. Therefore, the difference between the time spent learning English and Chinese is 7 - 5 = 2 hours.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day studying both languages together.  Therefore, if he studies for 5 days straight, he will spend a total of 13 x 5 = 65 hours studying both languages combined.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day studying languages.  If he studies for 2 days, he will spend a total of 11 x 2 = 22 hours studying languages over those two days. So, Ryan spends all his time learning English during these 2 days.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 9 hours (5 + 4) per day studying languages.  If he studies for 6 days in a row, he will spend a total of 54 hours (9 x 6) studying languages. So, if we want to know how many hours Ryan spends learning Chinese each day, we can divide the total number of hours he spent studying languages by the number of days he studied: 54 hours / 6 days = 9 hours per day. Therefore, Ryan spends 9 hours per day learning Chinese.;
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of:  Time spent learning English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 328 hours Time spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours In total, Ryan will have spent 832 hours (328 + 504) learning both languages during those 86 days.;
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, 7 hours per day learning Chinese, and 3 hours per day learning Spanish. How many hours does he spend learning all three languages combined?  To find out how many hours Ryan spends learning all three languages, we need to add up the time he spends on each language. So, in total, Ryan spends 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day learning all three languages. Therefore, the answer is 16 hours.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English. Therefore, in one week (7 days), he will spend a total of 42 hours (6 x 7) studying English.  Next, we are told that Ryan spends 3 hours per day studying Chinese. So, in one week, he will spend a total of 21 hours (3 x 7) studying Chinese.  Finally, we are informed that Ryan spends 58 hours per week studying Spanish. This means that he will have spent a total of 390 hours (58 x 7) studying Spanish over the course of one week.  Now, let's compare how much time Ryan spends studying each language:  English - 42 hours/week Chinese - 21 hours/week Spanish - 390 hours/week  Based on this information, it can be seen that Ryan spends significantly more time studying Spanish than any other language. In fact, he spends almost twice as many hours studying Spanish as he does studying Chinese!;
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours per day studying English, which means he spends 14 hours (7 x 2) studying both Chinese and Spanish combined. Therefore, he spends more time studying English than any other language. So, the answer is 7 hours.";
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, 5 hours per day learning Chinese, and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent learning Spanish from the time spent learning Chinese.
So, if Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese, and 4 hours per day learning Spanish, then the difference between the two is:
5 - 4 = 1 hour
Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day learning Chinese than Spanish.";
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends 2 hours per day learning English. So, to find out how many hours he spends learning Chinese, we can subtract the time he spends learning English from the total time he spends learning both languages each day:  Total time spent learning both languages = Time spent learning English + Time spent learning Chinese - Time spent learning English = 3 hours/day - 2 hours/day = 1 hour/day Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.;
Response:  For English, he spent 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours.  For Chinese, he spent 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours. So in total, he spent 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany collected $8 worth of cans and then found $7 more cans on Tuesday (berikutnya). So, in total, Tiffany collected $8 + $7 = $15 worth of cans. Therefore, the number of cans that Tiffany brought home on Monday is $15 / $0.80 per can = 18 cans.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany collected $7 worth of cans and found $12 more cans on Tuesday. So, in total, she had $29 worth of cans ($7 + $12). Therefore, the number of cans Tiffany found on Tuesday is $29 / $1 = 29 cans.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany collected $4$ kantongs of cans and found some more cans worth $6$. So, in total, she had $10$ kantongs of cans on Monday.  Now, let's assume that each day she finds an additional number of cans equal to the number of cans she already has. Therefore, if she found $x$ kantongs of cans on Tuesday ($= Wednesday + Thursday$), then she would have a total of $x+10$ kantongs of cans on those days.  Since Tiffany found $3$ kantongs of cans on Wednesday, we can say that she had a total of $x+13$ kantongs of cans from Monday to Wednesday ($= x+10 + 3$).  But since she didn't find any cans on Thursday, her total collection remained at $x+13$.  Therefore, the answer is $x = 7$.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany collected some cans to recycle. She had several can crushers on that day. The next day, she found 4 more can crushers with different values. If she has a total of 8 bags, how many bags does she have on Monday?  We know that Tiffany has 7 bags on Monday because she collects 4 more bags on the next day. So, the answer is 7.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany had 10 canteens. Then she found 3 more canteens on Tuesday (Sener). So now she has 10 + 3 = 13 canteens. Next day Wednesday (Wes), she found 7 more canteens, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 canteens in total. Therefore, Tiffany has 20 canteens.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany collected 8 cans of food for recycling. Then, on Tuesday (Senerai), she found 10 more cans of food. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 10 = 18 cans of food on Tuesday. On Wednesday (Rabu), she found 4 more cans of food, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 cans of food on Wednesday. Therefore, after Monday, Tiffany had 18 cans of food.;
Response:  On Monday (Senin), Tiffany had 3 kantongs of canned goods. Then, she found additional 7 kantongs on Tuesday (Selasa). So, in total, Tiffany had 3 + 7 = 10 kantongs of canned goods. Finally, there were 44 kantongs of bottles, which is not related to the number of kantongs of canned goods that Tiffany had. Therefore, the correct answer is 10.;
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more red apples there are than green apples, we can subtract the number of green apples from the number of red apples:

17 - 16 = 1

So, there is one more red apple than green apple in the basket.";
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can use the following equation: Number of green apples - Number of red apples = Difference between the two numbers. In this case, the number of green apples is 11, and the number of red apples is 5. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 11 - 5 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.;
Response:  We have 10 red apples and some green apples in a container. How many green apples are there if we have a total of 15 apples in the container? To find out, let's divide the number of red apples (10) by the total number of apples (15). So, there are 3/2 = 6 green apples in the container. Therefore, there are 6 green apples in the container.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 red apples and some green apples in the barrel. If there are more than 10 green apples than red apples in the barrel, then we can say that the number of green apples is greater than the number of red apples. So, the answer is (greater than 10).;
Response:  We have 7 red apples, 15 yellow apples, and 8 green apples in the basket. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Red Apples = 7 Yellow Apples + 8 Green Apples = 20 (since there are 20 apples in total) Now, let's solve for the number of apples in the basket: Number of Apples = 20 / 3 = 6 So, there are 6 apples in the basket.;
Response:  We have 7 red apples, 71 yellow apples, and 8 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we need to subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples. So, the answer is:  Number of green apples = Total apples - Red apples = 7 + 71 - 7 = 47  Therefore, there are 47 more green apples than red apples in the basket.;
Response:  We have 2 red apples, 6 yellow apples, and 14 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than yellow apples, we need to subtract the number of yellow apples from the total number of apples. So, the answer is:  Number of green apples > Yellow apples = 14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more green apples than yellow apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 19 red persimmons, 11 yellow persimmons, and 12 green persimmons in the container. To find out how many more red persimmons than yellow persimmons are in the container, we can use the following equation: Number of red persimmons - Number of yellow persimmons = Difference between red and yellow persimmons So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Number of red persimmons = 19 Number of yellow persimmons = 11 Therefore, the difference between the number of red persimmons and the number of yellow persimmons is: Difference = 19 - 11 = 8 So, there are 8 more red persimmons than yellow persimmons in the container.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 red apples and 90 yellow apples in the barrel. So, the total number of apples is 6 + 90 = 96 apples. Now, we need to find out how many red and green apples are in the barrel. From the question, we know that there are 6 red apples and 16 green apples. Therefore, the number of red apples in the barrel is 6, and the number of green apples is 16.;
Response:  We know that there are 18 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the barrel. To find out how many red apples are in the barrel, we can divide the number of red apples by the total number of apples in the barrel:  Number of red apples = 18 / (18 + 14) = 5/9 = 2/3  So, there are 2/3 or approximately 66% red apples in the barrel. Similarly, to find out how many yellow apples are in the barrel, we can divide the number of yellow apples by the total number of apples in the barrel:  Number of yellow apples = 14 / (18 + 14) = 1/3 = 1/6  So, there are 1/6 or approximately 16.7% yellow apples in the barrel.;
Response:  We know that there are 5 red apples and 14 yellow apples in the basket. Since we also have 6 green apples, let's count them separately. So, the total number of apples in the basket is: 5 + 14 = 19 apples. Therefore, there are 19 green apples in the basket.;
Response:  We know that there are 65 keranjangs in total. Each keranjang contains 7 red apples and 3 green apples. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red apples = Number of keranjangs x Number of red apples per keranjang Total number of green apples = Number of keranjangs x Number of green apples per keranjang Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of red apples = 65 x 7 = 455 Total number of green apples = 65 x 3 = 195 Therefore, there are 455 red apples and 195 green apples in all the keranjangs combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 11 keranjangs in total. Each keranjang has 10 red apples and 18 green apples. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of red apples = Number of keranjangs x Number of red apples per keranjang Total number of green apples = Number of keranjangs x Number of green apples per keranjang Now let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations: Total number of red apples = 11 x 10 = 110 Total number of green apples = 11 x 18 = 198 Therefore, there are 110 red apples and 198 green apples in total.;
Response:  We know that there are 6 keranjangs in total. Each keranjang has 16 red apples and 18 green apples. So, the total number of red apples is 6 x 16 = 96. The total number of green apples is 6 x 18 = 108. Therefore, there are 96 red apples and 108 green apples in all 6 keranjangs combined.;
Response:  We know that there are 7 keranjangs in total. Each keranjang has 10 red apples and 2 green apples. So, the total number of red apples is 7 x 10 = 70, and the total number of green apples is 7 x 2 = 14. Therefore, the total number of green apples in all 7 keranjangs is 14.;
"Response:  We know that there are 7 persimmons in total, and each container has either 4 red persimmons or 3 green persimmons. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Total number of containers = Number of red persimmons + Number of green persimmons

We also know that there are 4 red persimmons in each container, so we can write another equation:

Number of red persimmons = Total number of containers x Number of red persimmons per container

Substituting the value of ""total number of containers"" from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

Number of red persimmons = (7 + 4) x 4 = 28

Similarly, we know that there are 3 green persimmons in each container, so we can write another equation:

Number of green persimmons = Total number of containers x Number of green persimmons per container

Substituting the value of ""total number of containers"" from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

Number of green persimmons = (7 + 3) x 3 = 21

Now, let's add up the number of red and green persimmons to find out how many containers there are:

Total number of persimmons = Number of red persimmons + Number of green persimmons
= 28 + 21
= 49

So, there are 49 containers of persimmons.";
Response:  We know that there are 2 keranjangs and each keranjang has 4 red apples and some green apples. So, in total, we have 2 x 4 = 8 red apples and some number of green apples. Since there are 12 apples in total, the number of green apples must be 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 green apples in each keranjang.;
Response:  We know that there are 16 apples in the basket and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green apples is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green apples in the basket.;
"Response:  If each basket contains 19 red persimmons and 4 green persimmons, then there are in total:

19 x 15 = 285 red persimmons
4 x 15 = 60 green persimmons

So, there are 285 + 60 = 345 persimmons in all 15 baskets combined.";
Response:  We have 10 boxes of strawberries and we want to distribute them equally among several containers. If each container has 4 red strawberries and 6 green strawberries, then how many containers are needed to accommodate all the strawberries? To find out, let's use division.  Division is used to divide a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we need to divide 10 (the total number of strawberries) into equal parts so that each part contains an equal number of strawberries. So, if we divide 10 by 4 (the number of red strawberries in each container), we get 2.5 containers for the red strawberries. Similarly, if we divide 10 by 6 (the number of green strawberries in each container), we also get 1.67 containers for the green strawberries. Since you can't have a fraction of a container, we will round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there will be 3 containers for the red strawberries and 2 containers for the green strawberries. So, in total, there will be 5 containers for both types of strawberries.;
Response:  We have 6 green apples, 60 yellow apples, and 2 red apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we need to count the number of each type of apple in the basket. Green apples = 6 Yellow apples = 60 Red apples = 2 So, there are 6 - 2 = 4 more green apples than red apples in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  If Jerry had 4 action figures in his room initially and then added some more, let's say he added 3 more. So now Jerry has 7 action figures (4 initial + 3 new). Then if he adds even more, let's say another 2, so now Jerry has 9 action figures (7 initial + 2 new). Therefore, the answer is 9.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had x figures of action figures in his room. Then he added 7 more figures to the rack. So now there are x + 7 figures in the rack altogether. Since we know that the total number of figures is 10, we can set up the equation: x + 7 = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, at the beginning, Jerry had 3 action figures in his room.;
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books in his room initially. Then he added 6 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures is now: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures. Therefore, there are 10 action figures in Jerry's room.;
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books in his shelf initially. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, now Jerry has 12 (action figures) + 9 (books) = 21 items in total. Since we are asked how many more action figures than books Jerry has, we can subtract the number of books from the total number of items: 21 - 9 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 more action figures than books in Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures in his room initially. When he added 4 more action figures to the shelf, the total number of items on the shelf became: Books + Action Figures = 10 + 2 = 12 Now, we need to find out how many books are more than the number of action figures on the shelf. So, the answer is: Number of books more than action figures = 12 - 2 = 10 Therefore, there are 10 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.;
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books in his room initially. Then he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items in Jerry's room is: 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 items. Therefore, there are 27 books in Jerry's room.;
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books in his room initially. Then he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items in Jerry's room is: 7 + 2 = 9. Now, let's compare the number of action figures with the number of books: 7 (action figures) vs 6 (books). Therefore, there are more action figures than books in Jerry's room. The difference between these two numbers is: 7 - 6 = 1. So, there are one more action figure than book in Jerry's room.;
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books in his room initially. Then he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, the total number of items on the shelf now is: 5 + 2 + 9 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 items (including both action figures and books) more than the initial number of action figures in Jerry's room.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures in his room. Then he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, the total number of action figures that are left now is: 8 + 4 - 5 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 action figures left in Jerry's room.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures in his room. Then he added 4 more and removed some of the old ones. So, if there are currently 6 action figures on his shelf, that means Jerry took 3 + 4 = 7 new action figures from the shelf. Therefore, Jerry took 7 action figures from the shelf.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his room. Then he added some more action figures and removed 10 of the old ones. So, if there are currently 8 action figures in Jerry's room, that means he must have added 8 - 10 = 2 new action figures to his collection. Therefore, Jerry has added 2 new action figures to his room.;
Response:  At first, Jerry had x action figures in his room. Then he added 2 new action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. So now there are x - 7 + 2 = x + 2 action figures in Jerry's room. Therefore, at the beginning, Jerry had x = 5 action figures in his room.;
Response:  If Jerry has 9 action figures in his room initially and then adds 7 more, he now has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total.  If he also has 10 books on his shelf, that means there are 16 - 10 = 6 empty spaces left on the shelf for action figures. Therefore, Jerry has 6 more action figures than the number of books he has. So, the answer is 6.;
Response:  Jerry has 3 books and 4 action figures in his room initially. So, the total number of items he has is 3 + 4 = 7. Then, he adds 2 more action figures to the rack, so now he has 7 + 2 = 9 action figures. Therefore, there are 9 action figures more than the number of books that Jerry has in his room.;
Response:  Jerry has 7 books and 3 action figures in his room initially. Then he adds 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, now there are 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Since we know that there are more than twice as many books as action figures (7 vs 3), we can conclude that there are at least 2 x 7 = 14 books in Jerry's room. Therefore, the correct answer is 14.;
Response:  We have 2 birds already sitting on the fence (Dua). Then, some other birds come to join them (beberapa). So, in total, we have 2 + however many new birds came to join = number of birds sitting on the fence now. Therefore, the answer is 2 + x, where x is the number of new birds that joined.;
Response:  At first, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them, making a total of 7 birds (3 + 4 = 7). So, at the beginning, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that there are 4 birds perched on the fence initially. Then, 6 more birds join them, making it a total of 10 birds (4 + 6 = 10). So, there are 10 birds sitting on the fence in total.;
Response:  We have 3 birds (burung) already sitting on the fence = $3$. Then, we have 5 new birds arriving to join them = $\boxed{5}$. So, in total, there are $3 + 5 = \boxed{8}$ birds and crows (burung gagak) sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 3 birds (gagak) already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds arrive to join them, making it 5 birds in total. So, there are now more birds than gagaks on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 5 > 3 = 2.;
Response:  We have 2 birds already sitting on the fence = 2. Then we have 6 more birds joining them = 6 + 2 = 8. So there are 8 birds in total sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 4 birds (storks) already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more storks join them, making it 6 in total. So, there are 6 storks sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 birds perched on the fence. So, in total, we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds perched on the fence. Then, 6 more crows join them, making it 7 + 6 = 13 birds in total perched on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
Response:  We have 6 birds (gagak) already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds of the same species join them, making it 8 total. So, there are now 8 birds that are more than the original 6 gagaks who were sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 4 birds (gagak) already sitting on the fence. Then, we have 6 more birds joining them, making it a total of 10 birds (6 + 4). So, there are 10 birds sitting on the fence in total.;
Response:  We have 6 birds already sitting on the fence. Then, we have 4 more birds coming to join them. So, in total, we have 10 birds (6 + 4) sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 5 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, we have 4 more birds coming to join them, making it a total of 9 birds (5 + 4). Now, we are asked how many more birds there are than birds that sit on the fence. So, the answer is 9 - 5 = 4 more birds. Therefore, the correct answer is 4.;
Response:  We have 3 birds already sitting on the fence = $3$ birds. Then, we have $2 + 6 = 8$ more birds coming to join them. So, in total, there are $3 + 8 = 11$ birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We have 5 bangau (eagles) and 3 burung duduk (birds sitting on the fence). Then, 4 more birds arrive to join them, making it a total of 7 birds. Now, we need to find out how many more birds there are than eagles. So, we divide the number of birds by the number of eagles: 7 birds / 5 eagles = 1.4 burung per eagle. Therefore, there are 1.4 times more birds than eagles.;
Response:  We have 6 birds already sitting on the fence = $6$ birds. Then, we have $3$ more birds coming to join them = $3$ birds. So, in total, there are $\boxed{9}$ birds sitting on the fence.;
Response:  We know that there are already 3 birds sitting on the fence in the beginning. Then, 6 more birds come and join them, making it a total of 9 birds (3 + 6 = 9). So, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence in the end.;
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we can divide the number of pages in the first chapter by the number of pages in the second chapter:  Number of pages in the first chapter = 48 pages  Number of pages in the second chapter = 11 pages  Therefore, there are 48 / 11 = 4 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter. So, the answer is 4.;
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:  Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So there are 43 additional pages in the second chapter compared to the first chapter.;
Response:  We know that there are 60 pages in the first chapter and 93 pages in total in the book. So, if we divide the total number of pages (93) by the number of pages in the first chapter (60), we get: $ \frac {93} {60} = 1.55$ pages. Therefore, there are approximately 1.55 chapters or 155 pages in the second chapter.;
Response:  We know that there are 2 chapters in the book and Chapter 2 has 36 pages long. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 2 Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, there are 31 pages in Chapter 1.;
Response:  The book has three parts or chapters (bab). Each chapter has a certain number of pages as follows:  - Bab 1 = 66 pages  - Bab 2 = 35 pages  - Bab 3 = 24 pages So, we need to add up all these numbers to find out how many pages are in total: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages Therefore, there are 125 pages in this book.;
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 91 Page number in Chapter 2 = x Where x is the number of pages in Chapter 2. Now, we are given that the third chapter has 25 pages more than the second chapter. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows: X + 25 = y Where y is the total number of pages in all three chapters. Substituting the values from the previous equations into these new equations, we get: 91 + 25 = y 66 = y Now, we can solve for y to find out how many pages there are in all three chapters: Y = 66  There are 66 pages in all three chapters. Since the first chapter has the most pages (91), it has more pages than the second chapter (23). Therefore, the answer is: The first chapter has more pages than the second chapter by 91 - 23 = 68 pages.;
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book: Chapter 1 has 35 pages, Chapter 2 has 18 pages, and Chapter 3 has 3 pages. To find out how many more pages than Chapter 2 have Chapter 3, we need to subtract the number of pages in Chapter 2 from the total number of pages in all three chapters. So, let's do that: Total pages = 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 Now, let's subtract the number of pages in Chapter 2 (18) from the total number of pages: Number of extra pages = 66 - 18 = 48 Therefore, there are 48 more pages after Chapter 2 compared to Chapter 3.;
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 53 pages, the second chapter has 75 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the third chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter:

53 - 21 = 32

So, there are 32 more pages in the first chapter than in the third chapter.";
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter is 61 pages long. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Length of Each Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages So, the answer to the question is 1931 pages.;
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages. The first chapter has 10 pages, so we can write this as 10 halaman panjang = 10 x 4 (since each page is 4 inches wide). Therefore, the total number of pages in the first chapter is 10 x 4 = 40 pages. Since there are two chapters, the total number of pages in the book is twice the number of pages in the first chapter, or 2 x 40 = 80 pages. So, there are 80 pages in the book.;
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages. The first chapter has 81 pages, so the second chapter must have x pages where x is the difference between 81 and 68 (the number of pages in the second chapter). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 81 - 68 = 13  So, there are 13 pages in the second chapter.;
Response:  We know that there are 62 people camping in total.  In the morning, 39 of them go out to sea kayaking. So, at this point, we have 62 - 39 = 23 people still camping.  Now, in the afternoon, another 10 people join for sea kayaking, bringing the total number of people camping and going out for sea kayaking to 23 + 10 = 33 people. Therefore, there are more people who went out for sea kayaking in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  We know that there are 52 people camping in the morning and 61 people camping in the afternoon. To find out how many more people are camping in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of people camping in the morning from the number of people camping in the afternoon:  So, there are 61 - 52 = 9 more people camping in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  We know that there are 15 people camping in the morning and some of them go kayaking in the afternoon. So, we can assume that some number x of those who went kayaking in the afternoon were among the 15 people camping in the morning. Therefore, the total number of people who went kayaking is equal to the difference between the total number of people camping and x.  Now, let's calculate the value of x. Since there are 32 people camping in total, and 15 people camped in the morning, then the number of people who camped in the afternoon is 32 - 15 = 17.  So, the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon is equal to 17.  Therefore, the answer is (17).;
Response:  We know that there are 12 people going kayaking in the morning and 7 people going kayaking in the afternoon. So, altogether, we have 12 + 7 = 19 people going kayaking for the whole day. Therefore, the number of people going kayaking in the morning is 12/19 = 63%.;
Response:  We know that there are 36 berths for daytime travelers and 13 berths for nighttime travelers. Therefore, in total, there are 36 + 13 = 49 berths available for all types of travelers.;
"Response:  We know that there are 44 people camping in the morning, and then we are told that 39 people are camping in the afternoon. So, the difference between the number of people camping in the morning and those who will be camping in the afternoon is:  
$ 44 - $ 39 = $ 5$  Therefore, there are five more people camping in the morning than in the afternoon.";
Response:  We know that there are 53 people going kayaking in the morning, and 48 people go kayaking in the afternoon. So, the total number of people who went kayaking is: 53 + 48 = 101 people. Now, we are asked how many more people went kayaking in the morning compared to the evening. To find this out, we simply subtract the number of people who went kayaking in the evening from the number of people who went kayaking in the morning: 101 - 49 = 52 people. Therefore, there are 52 more people who went kayaking in the morning than in the evening.;
Response:  We know that there are 34 kemahs going for dawn and 10 kemahs going at night. So, in total, we have: 34 + 10 = 44 kemahs going during the daytime. Now, let's compare how many more kemahs go during the day than at night: 44 - 34 = 10 more kemahs go during the day than at night. Therefore, there are 10 more kemahs going during the day than at night.;
Response:  We know that there are 13 people who went kayaking in the morning and 59 people who went hiking in the morning. So, altogether we have 13 + 59 = 72 people who went out for activities in the morning. Now, let's consider the afternoon. We know that 21 people went kayaking in the afternoon. Therefore, the total number of people who went kayaking is 21. Adding this to the number of people who went hiking in the morning, we get 72 + 21 = 93 people who went out for activities in the afternoon.  So, the answer to the question is 93.;
Response:  We know that there are 29 people who went kayaking in the morning and 66 people who went hiking in the morning. So, the total number of people who went out for adventure in the morning is: 29 + 66 = 95 people. Now, we know that 26 people went camping in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who went out for adventure in the morning and those who went out for adventure in the afternoon is: 95 - 26 = 70 people.;
Response:  We know that there are 41 people going for kayaking in the morning and 4 people going for hiking in the morning. So, the total number of people who went out in the morning is: 41 + 4 = 45 people. Now, we know that 26 people came back in the evening from their kayaking trip. Therefore, the total number of people who went for both kayaking and hiking is: 45 - 26 = 19 people.;
Response:  We know that there are 43 people who went kayaking in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon = Total number of people - Number of people who went kayaking in the morning  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon = 46 - 43  Number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon = 3  Therefore, there were 3 additional people who went kayaking in the afternoon.;
Response:  At first, there are 7 apples in the tree. Then, Rachel takes 4 of them. So, how many apples are left in the tree now? We can write this as an equation:  Number of apples = Original number of apples - Number of apples taken  In this case, the original number of apples is 7 and Rachel took 4, so we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the remaining number of apples:  Number of apples = 7 - 4  Number of apples = 3  Therefore, there are 3 apples left in the tree after Rachel takes 4.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 apples on the tree. Then, Rachel took some apples and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, the number of apples that Rachel took is equal to the number of apples remaining on the tree minus the original number of apples on the tree. In other words, we can write it as follows: Number of apples taken = Number of apples remaining - Original number of apples on the tree Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of apples taken = 2 - 4 = -2 apples Therefore, Rachel took -2 apples from the tree.;
Response:  Rachel took 7 ripe apples from her tree and now there are 5 remaining apples on the tree. If 3 of them ripen and the rest haven't yet ripened how many unripened apples are left on the tree? So, the number of unripened apples is 5 - 3 = 2.;
Response:  If Rachel takes 2 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 7 remaining apples, then we can assume that 5 of those 7 apples are still immature (not yet ripe). So, if 6 of them ripen, there will be only 1 immature apple left on the tree. Therefore, the number of ripe apples on the tree after 6 of them have ripened is 1 + 5 = 6 apples.;
Response:  If Rachel took 6 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples, then we can deduce that there were originally 8 apples on the tree (6 + 2). So, the number of apples that the tree started with is 8.;
Response:  If Rachel took 3 ripe apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples, then we can calculate how many ripe apples the tree had initially as follows: Number of ripe apples = Total number of apples - Number of apples taken by Rachel Initially, there were 3 + 2 = 5 ripe apples on the tree. Therefore, the correct answer is 5.;
Response:  Rachel took 7 apples from her tree and then two new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples left. To find out how many apples the tree had to start with, we need to subtract the number of apples that Rachel took (7) from the total number of apples the tree had (6 + 2 = 8). So, the answer is 8.;
Response:  At first, there were 2 apples in the tree (Rachel took 4). Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree. So, now there are 5 apples in total (2 + 3 = 5).;
Response:  If Rachel took 2 apples from one of her apple trees, then she has 52 - 2 = 50 apple trees left. Each tree still has 7 apples, so the total number of apples is 50 x 7 = 350 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that the remaining tree must start with is 350.;
Response:  At first, there were 3 trees with apples. If each tree had 8 apples, then the total number of apples was 3 x 8 = 24. Now, after Rachel took some apples from each tree, the remaining apples in each tree are 9 (since each tree now has 9 apples left). So, the total number of apples that were originally present in all the trees is 24 + 24 + 24 = 76. Therefore, the correct answer is 76.;
Response:  If Rachel took 7 apples from each of her 4 apple trees, she would have taken a total of 7 x 4 = 28 apples. So there are still 1 apple left on the trees, which means that Rachel has taken 28 + 1 = 29 apples in total. Therefore, the answer is 29.;
Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 19 balls now and Doug has X balls, then we can write an equation:  Ed = Doug + 2. Now, we are told that Doug lost some of his balls in the playground. Let's say he lost Y balls. Then, we can rewrite the equation as follows:  Ed = Doug + 2 - Y. Now, we want to find out how many balls Doug lost. Therefore, we solve for Y:  Y = Ed - (Doug + 2). Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Y = 19 - (2 + 0) = 17. So, Doug lost 17 balls in the playground.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 10 more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed has x marbles, then Doug has x - 10 marbles.  Since Doug lost 11 marbles in the park, he now has x - 11 marbles.  Now we can compare how many marbles each of them have:  Ed has x marbles and Doug has x - 11 marbles.  Therefore, Ed has 45 marbles more than Doug.;
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 6 balls than Doug. So, if Ed had 22 marbles and lost 7 in the playground, then he would have 15 marbles left (22 - 7 = 15). Therefore, Doug now has 9 marbles (6 + 3 = 9) since he started with fewer marbles than Ed.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 5 more marbles than Doug initially. So, if Doug had x marbles at first, then Ed had 5 + x marbles initially.  When Doug lost 3 marbles in the park, he was left with x - 3 marbles. Since Ed also played in the same park and lost no marbles, his total number of marbles remained unchanged at 5 + x marbles. Therefore, the difference between Ed's initial number of marbles and Doug's remaining marbles is equal to 5 + x - (x - 3) = 8x - 8.  Now we are asked how many marbles Doug originally had. So, we need to solve for x: 8x - 8 = 27  Divide both sides by 8: x = 3  Therefore, Doug originally had 3 marbles.;
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 24 balls and he found 9 additional ones in the park. So, Ed now has __________ balls in total.  Since Doug lost 27 balls from his collection, we can subtract this number from the total amount of balls Ed found to get the number of balls Doug had initially. Therefore, the number of balls Doug had initially is __________. Now, we can simply divide the number of balls Ed found by the number of balls Doug had initially to find out how many balls Ed took away from Doug. Thus, the final answer is: Ed took away __________ balls from Doug.;
"Response:  We know that Ed has 29 more balls than Doug. So, if Ed had x balls and Doug had x - 17 balls, then we can write an equation:
Ed = Doug + 29
Now, let's solve for x (the number of balls Ed has):
x = Doug + 29
Substituting Doug's value from the problem:
x = 29 + 17
x = 46
Therefore, Ed has 46 balls in total.";
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more balls than Doug initially. So, if Ed has 8 more balls now, it means he lost some of his initial amount. The number of balls Ed lost is equal to the difference between the number of balls he had initially and the number of balls he has now. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of marbles Ed lost = Initial number of marbles - Current number of marbles  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of marbles Ed lost = 19 - 8  = 11  So, Ed lost 11 marbles while playing in the park.;
Response:  We know that Ed has 30 more balls than Doug. So, if Ed had x balls and Doug had x - 30 balls, then we can write an equation as follows:  x = 91 + (x - 30)  Substituting x = 91 into this equation, we get: 91 = 61 + (x - 30)  Solving for x, we find that Ed has 71 more balls than Doug. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Ed has 71 more balls than Doug.;
Response:  At first, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug (Ed = 12 + Doug). Then, Ed lost 20 marbles in the playground (Ed - 20). Now we need to find out how many marbles Doug has now. So, let's add Ed's original number of marbles to the number he lost: Doug = Ed - 20 + Ed = 12 + 20 = 32 marbles. Therefore, Doug has 32 marbles now.;
Response:  If 408 students suggest adding mashed potatoes and 42 students suggest adding beef to the school lunch menu, then we can say that the number of students who prefer mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who prefer beef.  Therefore, the answer is (A) Mashed potatoes.;
"Response:  If 479 students suggest adding mashed potatoes and 489 students suggest adding beef to the school lunch menu, then we have:

Total number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 479
Total number of students suggesting beef = 489

Now, let's find out how many more students prefer beef than mashed potatoes:

Number of students preferring beef over mashed potatoes = Total number of students suggesting beef - Total number of students suggesting mashed potatoes
= 489 - 479
= 10

Therefore, 10 more students prefer beef than mashed potatoes.";
Response:  If 185 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 310 students were asked in total, then we can say that 185/310 = x where x is the number of students who suggested adding beef to the menu. Since there are 185 students who suggested adding potatoes, we know that 310 - 185 = 125 students did not suggest adding any vegetables. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding beef is 125.;
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. This means that 14 students did not suggest adding bacon (i.e., they gave other suggestions). Now, we are asked how many students suggested adding potatoes. Since there were only 14 students who did not suggest adding bacon, it is likely that most of them also suggested adding potatoes. Therefore, we can estimate that around 13 students (i.e., 14 - 1) suggested adding potatoes. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is approximately 13.;
Response:  If 457 students suggest adding potatoes and 63 students suggest adding beef, then there are more students who suggest adding potatoes than those who suggest adding beef. So, we can say that $ \text{more students suggest adding potatoes} $.  Now, let's find out how many times more students suggest adding potatoes than suggesting adding beef. We know that $\boxed{\text{63 students}} $ suggest adding beef, so we need to divide the number of students who suggest adding potatoes by the number of students who suggest adding beef: $$ \frac{\text{number of students who suggest adding potatoes}}{\text{number of students who suggest adding beef}} = \frac{457}{63} = 7 $$ Therefore, there are $ \boxed{\text{7 times more students who suggest adding potatoes than suggesting adding beef}} $.;
Response:  If 182 students suggest adding potatoes and 166 students suggest adding beef, then there are more students who suggest adding beef than those who suggest adding potatoes. So, we can say that $ \text {number of students who suggest adding beef} > \text{ number of students who suggest adding potatoes }$.  Therefore, the answer is (D).;
Response:  If 324 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 374 students suggest adding beef, then there are 698 total suggestions for new menu items (324 + 374).  However, if only 128 students participate in suggesting vegetables, then there are 560 remaining students who do not participate in suggesting any new menu items (698 - 128 = 560).;
Response:  If 257 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 97 students suggest adding beef, then there are more students who prefer potatoes than those who prefer beef. Therefore, we can conclude that  more students (120) prefer potatoes than those who prefer beef (97). So, the answer is 120.;
"Response:  If 144 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 79 students suggest adding tomatoes, then we have:

Total number of students suggesting vegetables = 144 + 79 = 223

Now, let's find out how many students are more likely to suggest potatoes than tomatoes:

Number of students who prefer potatoes over tomatoes = Total number of students suggesting potatoes / Total number of students suggesting vegetables x 100
= 467 / 223 x 100
= 68%

Therefore, based on the given information, 68% of the students are more likely to suggest potatoes than tomatoes.";
Response:  We know that out of 228 students who participated in the survey, 337 students suggested adding beef to the menu. This means that 109 more students (337 - 228) preferred beef than those who suggested adding potatoes (228). Therefore, the answer is 109.;
Response:  If 450 students suggest adding potatoes to the menu and 38 students suggest adding beef, then we have a total of 488 suggestions (450 + 38).  Since Sofia asked for a new food suggestion from each student, the number of participating students is equal to the total number of suggestions divided by the number of suggestions per student. Therefore, the number of participating students is 488 / 4 = 122 students.;
"Response:  If 218 students suggest adding mashed potatoes and 351 students suggest adding only bacon to the menu, then we have:

Total number of suggestions = 218 + 351 = 570

So, there are 570 suggestions in total.";
Response:  We know that there are 269 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu and 330 students who suggested adding potatoes. So, the total number of students who suggested adding some type of meat is 269 + 330 = 599. On the other hand, we have 76 students who suggested adding tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding vegetables is 76. Now, let's compare the numbers: The total number of students who suggested adding meat (599) is greater than the total number of students who suggested adding vegetables (76). So, based on this information, it can be said that more students preferred the idea of adding potatoes than the idea of adding tomatoes.;
Response:  Number of girls = 569. Number of boys = 236. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. Therefore, there are 333 more girls than boys in that school.;
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys at the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we need to subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:  Number of boys = 841 - 34 = 807 Therefore, there are 807 more boys than girls at the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at the school. Of these, 232 are girls and 253 are boys. So, the number of boys is 253. Therefore, the answer to your question is 253.;
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 228 more girls than boys, then the number of boys must be less than 228.  Therefore, the number of boys is equal to 228 - x, where x is the number of boys in the school.  Now we can substitute this value into the original equation:  Number of boys = 228 - x  Substituting x = 228 - x, we get:  Number of boys = 228 - (228 - x)  Simplifying and solving for x, we find that there are 100 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 635 students in total at the school and 510 of them are boys. So, we can write this as:  Number of boys = 510  Now, we want to find out how many more boys than girls there are at the school. To do this, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:  Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of girls = 635 - 510  = 125  Therefore, there are 125 more boys than girls at the school.;
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are 868 students in total and 281 of them are boys, then the number of girls is 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, there are 587 more girls than boys in this school.;
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in total at the school and 142 more boys than girls. So, if we divide the number of boys (142) by the total number of students (700), we get:  Number of boys / Total number of students = 142/700 = 0.203  Therefore, there are approximately 203 boys for every 100 girls at the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 706 girls and 222 boys in school. Then, 418 girls joined the school. So, the total number of students in the school now is:  Total number of students = Initial number of girls + Number of girls who joined the school - Initial number of boys  Total number of students = 706 + 418 - 222 = 946 Therefore, there are 946 students in the school currently.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we need to find out how many girls are currently in the school. To do this, we can simply add the initial number of girls with the number of new girls who joined the school:  Number of girls = Initial number of girls + New girls joining the school = 902 + 44 = 946 girls Now, we have found out that there are 946 girls in the school currently.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that initially there are 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls join the school. So, now the total number of girls is 632 + 465 = 1097. On the other hand, the number of boys remains unchanged at 410. Therefore, the ratio of girls to boys in the school after the new students join is 1097 : 410 = 2.68.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys at the school initially. Then, 682 girls and 8 boys join the school, so the total number of girls now is: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, there are 1414 girls currently enrolled in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys at first. Then, 496 more girls join the school, so now we have 135 + 496 = 631 girls in total. Similarly, 910 boys join the school later, so now we have 214 + 910 = 1124 boys in total. Therefore, there are currently 1124 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in school. If we want to find out how many teachers are at the school, we need to divide the total number of students (344) by the number of classes per grade level (let's assume 2 classes per grade level). So, if there are 2 classes per grade level, then the number of teachers is: 344 / 2 = 172 teachers.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are in total at the school. We can do this by multiplying the number of girls and boys together: 315 x 309 = 94,650. Next, we need to subtract the number of teachers from the total number of students: 94,650 - 772 = 87,978. Therefore, there are 87,978 people at the school.;
Response:  We know that there are more than 402 girls in the school (the given information). So, we can assume that the total number of students in the school is greater than or equal to 402 + 739 = 1141. Therefore, there are 1141 students in the school, including both boys and girls.;
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in school (458 more). So, if we have 692 students in total, then the number of boys must be less than 692 - 458 = 234. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.;
Response:  We know that initially there are 362 boys and 257 girls in school. Then, another 403 girls join the school. So, now we have: Total number of boys = 362 + 403 = 765 Number of girls = 257 + 403 = 659 Therefore, there are more than 659 girls than boys in the school.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward has $ 18 and he spends $ 16. So, his remaining amount of money is: $ 18 - $ 16 = $ 2. Therefore, Edward currently has $ 2 in his pocket.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward had $ 13 and he spent some of it. So, let's say he spent half of his money, which is $ 6.50 (since he has $ 13 / 2 = $ 6.50). Now, he has $ 3 left after spending. Therefore, the amount of money that was taken out or deducted from Edward is $ 6.50 - $ 3 = $ 3.50.;
Response:  Before Edward spent money, he had $ 9. Then he spent $ 8 and now he has $ 17. So, the amount that Edward had before he spent his money is: $ 9 - $ 8 = $ 1. Therefore, the amount of money that Edward had before he spent it was $ 1.;
Response:  Before spending money, Edward had $ 16. He bought 92 books at $ 10 each, so he spent $ 920. Now he has $ 6 left. Therefore, Edward had $ 15 before spending his money.;
Response:  If Edward spends $6 to buy two books each costing the same amount of money (i.e., $x), then he will have $6 - x left after buying the first book. Similarly, if he has $12 now and spent $6 on both books, he must have had $12 - ($6 + x) = $12 - $7 = $5 left before buying the second book. Therefore, the price of each book is $x = $5 / 2 = $2.50 per book.;
Response:  Firstly, Edward spent $ 6 to buy a book and then he spent $ 16 to buy a pen. So now he has $ 19 left with him. To find out how much money Edward had before spending any amount, we need to subtract the total amount that he spent from his initial amount of money. Therefore, the answer is: $ 19 - ($ 6 + $ 16) = $ 19 - $ 22 = $ 3.;
Response:  If Edward spent $ 4 for the book and $ 3 for the pen, then he has $ 12 left after making those purchases. So, we can write an equation as follows: Book cost = $ 4 Pen cost = $ 3 Total amount spent = $ 12 Now, let's solve for the cost of the book and the cost of the pen: Cost of book = $ 12 - $ 4 = $ 8 Cost of pen = $ 12 - $ 3 = $ 9 Therefore, Edward spent $ 8 for the book and $ 9 for the pen.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $ 16 for the book and $ 8 for the pen. So he has $ 16 + $ 8 = $ 24 left after purchasing both items. Therefore, Edward spent $ 24 / $ 2 = $ 12 for the book.  So, Edward spent $ 12 for the book.;
Response:  Before he spent money, Edward had $ 17. Then he received $ 10 from his friend. Now he has $ 7 left. So, initially Edward had $ 17 - $ 10 = $ 7.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did more than 44 push-ups. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than 44. Now, we are given that David did 58 push-ups, so we can write an equation as follows:  x + 44 = 58  To solve for x, subtract 44 from both sides of the equation:  x = 14  Therefore, Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 14 push-ups more than Zachary.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did:  Number of push-ups done by Zachary - Number of push-ups done by David = 51 - 44 = 7  So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.;
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups today at school. If David did more than Zachary, then Zachary must have done fewer than 44 push-ups. So, we can say that Zachary did x push-ups, where x is less than or equal to 44. Now, we are given that David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  David did 44 push-ups + (Zachary did x push-ups) = 53 push-ups. Simplifying the equation, we get:  x = 11. So, Zachary did 11 push-ups today.;
Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups and Zachary did 49 push-ups. So, we can write an equation as follows:  David - 49 = Zachary's number of push-ups.  Solving for Zachary's number of push-ups, we get:  Zachary's number of push-ups = 51 - 49 = 2. Therefore, Zachary did 2 push-ups less than David.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches.  David did more than 19 push-ups but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that David did x push-ups where x is greater than or equal to 19. Now, we are given that David did 27 less push-ups than Zachary. This means that Zachary did x push-ups plus 27 = 36 push-ups (since he did 59 - 27 = 32 push-ups). Therefore, David did 36 + 19 = 55 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and 17 crunches.  We also know that David did more than 29 push-ups but fewer than 44 push-ups. So, we can say that David did x push-ups where x is between 29 and 44 (inclusive). Now, we are given that David did fewer crunches than Zachary. This means that David did x crunches where x is less than or equal to 17 (since Zachary did 17 crunches). Therefore, the number of crunches done by David is x = 17.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary but fewer crunches. So, if David did x push-ups, he would have done 17 + x crunches. Since we know that David did less crunches than Zachary, we can say that x < 14. Therefore, Zachary did 53 + (x - 14) = 53 + 6 = 69 push-ups and 14 crunches.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches.  David did more than 58 push-ups but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that Zachary did x push-ups where x is greater than or equal to 35. Now let's use the information given in the problem to find out exactly how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 58 push-ups more than Zachary. This means that if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did (x + 58) push-ups. Since David did fewer than Zachary, we know that (x + 58) is less than or equal to 87. Simplifying this inequality, we get: x + 58 ≤ 87. Solving for x, we get: x = 42. Therefore, Zachary did 42 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. So, we can write an equation as follows: Push-ups = 46 Crunches + X Where X is the number of extra crunches Zachary did beyond his push-ups. Since David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, we can say that David did 38 - 46 = -18 push-ups (since he did fewer push-ups). Now, let's find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can write another equation: Crunches = 58 - (62 - X) Here, X represents the number of crunches Zachary did beyond his push-ups. Substituting the values from the previous equations, we get: Crunches = 58 - (62 - X) = 46 - X Solving for X, we get: X = 20 Therefore, Zachary did 20 additional crunches beyond his push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did more than Zachary because he did 39 push-ups while Zachary only did 19. So, we can say that David did x push-ups and Zachary did y push-ups, where x > y.  Now, we are also given that John did fewer push-ups than David. This means that John did x - 13 push-ups, where x is the number of push-ups done by David.  Therefore, the number of push-ups done by David is 39.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 22 more than Zachary, so David did 73 push-ups (51 + 22 = 73). Since John did fewer push-ups than David, John did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did more than 39 push-ups. So, we can say that David did at least 44 push-ups (since he did more than 39). Now, we are told that John did fewer push-ups than David. Therefore, John did 44 - 9 = 35 push-ups. So, Zachary did 15 push-ups compared to John who did 35 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 30 push-ups more than Zachary. So if David did x push-ups, then Zachary did x - 30 push-ups. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x = 37 + 30 ∴ x = 67  So, Zachary did 67 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 56 push-ups more than Zachary in class today. So, if David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did x push-ups. Since David did 56 more than Zachary, we can write an equation as follows:  David did 56 - x = 38  Now let's solve for x.  To do this, subtract 56 from both sides of the equation:  x = 38 - 56  x = -18  Therefore, Zachary did 18 push-ups.;
Response:  We know that David did 40 push-ups more than Zachary and 17 less than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups, then David did 40 - 17 = 23 push-ups. Now we need to find out how many crunches David did. Since Zachary did 62 crunches, David did 23 + 62 = 85 crunches. Therefore, David did 85 crunches.;
Response:  We know that David did 36 push-ups and 33 were less than Zachary's total. So, Zachary did at least 36 + 1 = 37 push-ups. Now we need to find out how many more push-ups Zachary did compared to crunches. Since he did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, the difference between his push-ups and crunches is 25 (58 - 33). Therefore, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches.;
Response:  We know that David did 27 push-ups and 7 less than Zachary. So, Zachary did 34 push-ups (27 + 7 = 34). Now we are told that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. To find out how many crunches Zachary did beyond his push-ups, we need to subtract the number of push-ups from the total number of exercises he did:  Crunches beyond push-ups = Total exercises - Push-ups  Crunches beyond push-ups = 17 - 5 = 12 Therefore, Zachary did 12 crunches beyond his 5 push-ups.;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. To find out how many more math pages she has than reading pages, we need to subtract the number of reading pages from the total number of math pages. So, if we subtract 2 from 5, we get 3. Therefore, Rachel has 3 more math pages than reading pages.;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 3 pages of homework in mathematics and 4 pages of reading comprehension. We know that each page of math homework takes her 2 hours to complete, and each page of reading comprehension takes her 1 hour to complete. So, if she spends x hours on reading comprehension, then she will spend (x + 4) hours on total homework. Since there are 4 pages of reading comprehension, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x + 4) = 72. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 4 = 72. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2x = 68. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 34. Therefore, Rachel has to spend more than 34 hours on reading comprehension than on math homework.;
Response:  If Rachel has to solve 5 pages of homework in mathematics and more than 5 pages of reading comprehension, then we can say that she has to solve a total of x pages of homework. Since each page of homework requires her to read for at least 5 minutes, then the total time required to complete all the homework is equal to x \* 5 minutes/page. Therefore, if there are y pages of reading comprehension, then the total time required to complete all the homework and reading comprehension is given by the equation: x \* 5 minutes/page + y \* 10 minutes/page = 7 hours. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 35 pages (homework) and y = 28 pages (reading comprehension). So, Rachel needs to spend 35 minutes solving the math homework and 280 minutes (46 minutes per page \* 6 pages) reading comprehension.;
Response:  If Rachel has to solve 7 pages of homework in mathematics and she needs to solve more than 4 pages of homework than reading her homework, then we can say that the number of pages she needs to read is equal to the difference between the total number of pages she needs to solve and the number of pages she needs to solve more than 4 pages. So, if she needs to solve 7 pages, then the number of pages she needs to read is equal to 7 - (4 + x), where x is the number of pages she needs to solve more than 4 pages. Therefore, the answer is 3 pages.;
Response:  If Rachel has to solve 8 pages of homework in mathematics and she needs to solve more than 3 pages more than the number of pages she reads for each problem, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages Rachel needs to read = Total number of pages - Number of pages she needs to solve + 3 So if the total number of pages is x, then the number of pages Rachel needs to read is x - (x/2) + 3 = 7x / 2 + 3 Now let's find out what value of 'x' satisfies this equation. We know that the total number of pages is 8, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 8 = 7x / 2 + 3 Solving for 'x', we get: x = 16 Therefore, Rachel needs to read 16 pages of her homework in mathematics.;
"Response:  If Rachel has to solve 8 pages of homework in mathematics and she reads more than 6 pages of PR math problems, then we can say that:

Total number of pages = 8 (homework) + x (PR math problems)

Since Rachel reads more than 6 pages of PR math problems, let's say x > 6.

So, total number of pages = 8 + x

Now, we need to find out what value of x will make the equation true. In this case, if Rachel has to read more than 6 pages of PR math problems, then x must be greater than or equal to 6.

Therefore, the answer is:

x >= 6";
"Response:  If Rachel has to solve 10 pages of homework in mathematics and she reads more than 3 pages of PR per day, then we can calculate how many days it will take her to finish all 10 pages as follows:

Days required = Total pages / Daily reading pages
= 10 / 3
= 3.33 days
So, it will take Rachel approximately 3.33 days to complete all 10 pages of homework in mathematics if she reads more than 3 pages of PR per day.";
Response:  Rachel has to complete 2 pages of homework in mathematics and 3 pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, she needs to complete 5 pages of homework (2 + 3). Now, let's consider the additional 10 pages of homework in biology. So, in total, Rachel needs to complete 15 pages of homework (5 + 10).;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension. Therefore, she has 9 + 2 = 11 pages of homework left to do in total. Now, let's compare how many pages of math homework Rachel has with how many pages of reading comprehension she has. Rachel has 96 pages of reading comprehension homework left to do, which is more than her 11 pages of math homework left to do. So, there are 96 - 11 = 85 more pages of reading comprehension for Rachel to complete compared to her math homework.;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension for math. Therefore, she has 9 pages of math homework left to do (11 - 2 = 9). Now, let's find out how many pages of biology homework Rachel has left to do. She has 3 pages of biology homework remaining (3 + 0 = 3), so the difference between the number of math pages and biology pages is 6 pages (9 - 3 = 6).  Therefore, there are 6 more pages of math homework than biology homework that Rachel needs to complete.;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 7 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far, she has 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework in total. Then, there are 8 additional pages of homework in biology, which brings the total number of pages of homework that Rachel has to do to 18 + 8 = 26 pages. Therefore, Rachel has 26 pages of homework in addition to her biology homework.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to solve 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to solve is 9 + 11 = 20 pages. Next, we are given that there are 29 additional pages of work in other subjects, which means Rachel also needs to solve those pages as well. So, the final answer is 20 + 29 = 49 pages.;
Response: 1) The total number of pages for math homework is 8. 2) The total number of pages for reading comprehension is 7. Therefore, the total number of pages for both math and reading comprehension is 8 + 7 = 15 pages. 3) Finally, there are 3 additional pages for biology homework, so the total number of pages for all three subjects (math, reading comprehension, and biology) is 15 + 3 = 18 pages.;
Response:  If Rachel has to complete 5 pages of homework in mathematics and 10 pages of reading comprehension, then she needs to read for 10 + 5 = 15 pages. Additionally, if she has to complete 6 more pages of science homework, that is an additional 6 pages. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to read for 15 + 6 = 21 pages.;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math problems. To find out how many more math problems Rachel has to do than reading comprehension, we can divide the number of math problems by 2 (since there are 2 pages of math problems). So, Rachel has to do 4/2 = 2 more math problems than reading comprehension. Therefore, Rachel has 6 math problems left to do (including the ones she already did).;
Response:  Rachel has to solve 4 pages of reading comprehension and 7 pages of math homework. So far, she has done 4 + 7 = 11 pages of work. Then, there are 19 additional pages of biology homework that she needs to do. Therefore, in total, Rachel has to do 11 + 19 = 30 pages of homework.;
Response:  On average, how many emails does Jack receive per day?  We know that Jack receives 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the evening. So, he receives a total of 8 emails per day (6 + 2 = 8). Therefore, the number of emails Jack receives in the morning is 6, and the number of emails he receives in the evening is 2.;
Response:  At morning, Jack received 6 emails and at evening he received 8 emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 emails. Therefore, the number of emails that Jack received at evening is 14 - 6 = 8 more than the number of emails he received at morning.;
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and several more in the evening, then he received a total of 4 + x emails during the day, where x is the number of emails he received in the evening. Since we are told that Jack received 5 emails in total during the day, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. So, Jack received 1 additional email in the evening.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails. And in the evening, he received 5 emails. So, altogether, Jack received 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails in one day. Therefore, the answer is 14.;
Response:  On days, Jack received 5 emails in the morning, which means he received 5 x 1 = 5 emails during this time period. Similarly, he received 8 emails in the evening and 72 emails at night, so his total number of emails for these three periods is: 5 + 8 + 72 = 95 emails. Therefore, Jack received 95 emails during the daytime (morning and evening).;
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Jack receives 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening, for a total of 9 emails. So, Jack received 9 x 2 = 18 emails during the daytime hours (morning + evening). Since there are no weekend days mentioned in the question, we can assume that Jack does not receive any emails on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received at night is equal to the number he received during the daytime hours minus the number he received on the weekends (0 emails). Hence, the answer is: 18 - 0 = 18 emails were received by Jack during the nighttime hours (from Monday to Friday).;
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 7 emails (3 + 4). Therefore, the answer is 7.;
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning, and we also know that he received 7 emails in the evening. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  10 + 7 = 17 Emails received by Jack during the daytime (morning + evening) Therefore, the number of emails Jack received during the daytime is 17.;
Response:  On average, how many emails does Jack receive per day?  We know that Jack receives 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails at night, so he receives a total of 9 + 7 = 16 emails per day. Therefore, Jack receives more emails during the day than at night.;
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Jack receives 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening. So, he receives a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime. In contrast, he only receives 4 emails at night. Therefore, the number of emails Jack receives at night is fewer than those he receives during the daytime. Hence, the difference between the number of emails Jack receives during the daytime and those he receives at night is 15 - 4 = 11 emails.;
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and 3 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 9 emails during the day (morning + evening). So, the number of emails Jack received in the evening is 9 - 3 = 6.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So in total, he received 67 pieces of mail (3 emails + 64 letters).  Then in the afternoon, Jack received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, in total, Jack received 121 pieces of mail during the day (67 from the morning + 54 from the afternoon).;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. So in total, he received 5 + 6 = 11 messages.  In the afternoon, Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters. So in total, he received 9 + 7 = 16 messages. Therefore, Jack received a total of 11 + 16 = 27 messages per day.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So in total, he received 10 + 12 = 22 messages in the morning.  In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So in total, he received 3 + 44 = 47 messages in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the morning is 22, and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is 47 - 22 = 25.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. So in total, he received 6 + 8 = 14 messages.  In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, in total, he received 14 + 2 = 16 messages.  So, Jack received more messages in the afternoon than in the morning.;
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 emails. So in total, he sent 91 + 6 = 97 emails in the morning.  Then, in the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and sent 74 emails. So in total, he sent 97 + 2 = 99 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack terima 2 email dalam sehari.;
Response:  On the morning (pagi), Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 replies. So in total, he sent 4 + 2 = 6 emails that day. Then, in the evening (sore), Jack received 6 emails and sent 8 replies. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack sent that day is 6 + 8 = 14 emails.;
"Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the evening, then he received X emails in the evening. Since we know that the total number of emails Jack received is 9, we can set up an equation as follows:

Number of emails received in the morning = 7
Total number of emails received = Number of emails received in the morning + Number of emails received in the evening
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

9 = 7 + X

Solving for X, we get:
X = 2
Therefore, Jack received 2 additional emails in the evening.";
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning, and 5 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received in the daytime is 3 + 5 = 8. Now, we are asked how many more emails Jack received at night compared to the daytime. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails he received at night (16) and the number of emails he received during the daytime (8) is 16 - 8 = 8. So, Jack received 8 more emails at night than he did during the daytime.;
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails in the morning, that means he received 7 emails in the afternoon and evening combined (since there are 6 hours between the morning and evening). So, Jack received a total of 7 + 3 = 10 emails in one day.;
Response:  Belalang can jump 9 inches and frog can jump 12 inches. So, we need to find out how many inches frog is ahead of snake.  We know that there are 12 inches between frog and snake, so frog is ahead of snake by 3 inches (12 - 9 = 3). Therefore, the distance between frog and snake is 3 inches.;
Response:  Belalang and frog are competing to jump. The belalang jumps 31 inches, while the frog jumps 35 inches. To find out how many times they can jump simultaneously, we need to divide their respective jumps by each other. So, 31 / 35 = x, where x is the number of times they can jump together. Therefore, they can jump simultaneously 3 times.;
Response:  Belalang melompat 36 inches = x feet (since there are 12 inches in one foot).  Katak melompat yyy feet more than belalang = 36 inches - x feet = x / 12 feet. Tikus melompat z feet less than katak = x / 12 - z feet. Now we have three equations: x + z = 17, x / 12 - z = 15, and x = 36. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 48, z = -9, and therefore y = 57. So katak melompat 57 inches.;
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 25 inches and Tikus can jump 2 inches more than Katak. So, Katak can jump 27 inches (since 2 + 18 = 20). Therefore, Tikus can jump 29 inches ( since 29 - 27 = 2).;
Response:  Belalang melompat 19 inches and katak melompat 10 inches more than belalang. So, belalang melompat 19 + 10 = 29 inches. Tikus melompat 20 inches more than katak. Therefore, katak melompat 30 inches (20 + 10). Thus, tikus melompat 59 inches from belalang (30 - 29).;
Response:  Belalang melompat 19 inches, which is equal to x feet. Since katak melomps more than belalang, we know that katak melomps 3x feet. Tikus also melomps less than katak, so tikus melomps (3x - 94) feet. Therefore, the distance katak melomps is 3x feet.;
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 25 inches and Tikus can jump 26 inches less than Belalang. So, Tikus can jump 25 - 26 = 1 inch.  Therefore, Tikus is 1 inch away from Belalang.;
Response:  We know that Belalang can jump 24 inches and Tikus can jump 5 inches less than Katak. So, Tikus can jump 29 inches (since 5 is less than 29). Now we need to find out how far Katak jumped compared to Belalang. Since Katak jumped 33 inches more than Belalang, it means Katak jumped 33 - 24 = 9 inches farther than Belalang. Therefore, Tikus jumped 29 - 9 = 20 inches farther than Belalang.;
Response:  We know that the length of Belalang's jump is 13 inches and Katak's jump is 2 inches longer than Belalang's jump. So, Katak's jump is 15 inches (2 + 13 = 15). Therefore, the distance Katak jumped is 15 inches.;
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 35 inches and the toad jumped x inches more than the frog. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Distance = 35 + (x - 35)  Now, we are asked how many times they jumped altogether. Therefore, we need to find out how many times the sum of their distances is equal to 100.  Using the equation above, we have:  Distance = 35 + (x - 35)  Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:  Distance^2 = 70 + (2x - 70)  Subtracting 70 from both sides gives us:  Distance^2 - 70 = 2x - 70  Squaring both sides gives us:  Distance^4 - 49 = 2x^2 - 140  Subtracting 49 from both sides gives us:  Distance^4 = 2x^2 - 191  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  Distance^2 = x^2 - 95  Since x is a positive number, we know that x^2 > 0.  Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog and the toad together is:  Distance = sqrt(x^2 - 95)  Taking the square root of both sides gives us:  Distance = x / sqrt(2)  Finally, multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:  Distance = 2x / sqrt(2)  Therefore, the answer is:  The frog and the toad jumped 2x / sqrt(2) times altogether.;
Response:  We know that Belalang (Frog) jumped 19 inches and Katak (Toad) jumped 44 inches less than Tikus (Mouse). So, if Tikus jumped x inches, then Katak jumped x - 44 inches. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Distance = Height + Speed × Time  In this case, the height is given as 19 inches for Belalang and x - 44 inches for Katak. The speed of Belalang is not mentioned in the problem statement, but it is assumed to be constant since it is a frog. Similarly, the speed of Katak is also assumed to be constant since it is a toad. Now, let's solve for x using the above equation:  Substituting the values given in the problem statement, we get:  Distance = 19 + (Speed of Belalang × Time) Distance = 19 + (Speed of Katak × (x - 44)) From here, we need to find out the value of x. Since Katak jumped x - 44 inches less than Tikus, we have:  x = 44 + Tikus' distance Tikus' distance = 44 + x Now, substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:  Distance = 19 + (Speed of Belalang × Time) Distance = 19 + (Speed of Katak × (44 + Tikus' distance)) Simplifying and solving for Tikus' distance, we get:  Tikus' distance = 63 inches Therefore, Katak jumped 63 inches.;
Response:  We know that Belalang (Frog) can jump 39 inches and Katak (Toad) can jump 12 inches less than Belalang. So, Katak can jump 39 - 12 = 27 inches. Tikus (Mouse) is between Katak and Belalang, so Tikus can jump 27 + 9 = 36 inches. Therefore, Tikus can jump 36 inches.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that belalang (bullfrog) can jump 21 inches and tikus (mouse) can jump 16 inches. So, if belalang jumps more than tikus, then belalang must have jumped 21 - 16 = 5 inches further than tikus. Therefore, the distance between belalang and tikus after the jump is 5 inches.;
Response:  We know that katak (frog) jumped 39 inches and belalang (gecko) jumped 17 inches. To find out how far away katak is from belalang after their respective jumps, we need to subtract the distance traveled by each of them. So, the difference between the two distances = 39 - 17 = 22 inches. Therefore, katak is 22 inches away from belalang after their respective jumps.;
Response:  We know that Belalang (frog) jumped 9 inches and Mouse jumped x inches less than frog. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Distance = Height of frog + Distance mouse jumped  Therefore, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get:  Distance = 9 + (-3) = 6 inches  Thus, the distance mouse jumped is 6 inches.;
Response:  We know that Belalang (frog) jumped 14 inches and Mouse jumped 16 inches less than frog. So, mouse jumped 14 - 16 = 2 inches less than frog. Therefore, the distance between mouse and frog is 37 - 2 = 35 inches.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cangkir ( cups) of flour to make the dough. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add based on the total amount required in the recipe. According to the question, the recipe requires 14 cangkir (cups) of flour and 6 cangkir (cups) of sugar. Therefore, the difference between the total amount of flour needed and the amount that Mary has already added is: 14 - 5 = 9 cangkir (cups) of flour. So, Mary needs to add an additional 9 cangkir (cups) of flour to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of flour and she needs to add another 7 cups (since there are 9 cups total). So, if we subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount needed, we get:  7 - 4 = 3 cups of sugar left to be added.;
Response:  We know that Mary needs 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar for her recipe. She has already added some flour, but we don't know how much. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total number of cups she needs. So, if she has already added x cups of flour, then she still needs 6 - x cups of flour. Since she also needs 13 cups of sugar, we can set up the equation: 6 - x = 13. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Mary needs 9 additional cups of flour.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 11 cangkir tepung and needs 2 more, then she still needs 9 cangkir tepung (11 - 2 = 9).  And if she has already added 7 cangkir gula, then she needs 4 more cangkir gula (7 + 4 = 11) to match the recipe. So the final answer is 9 cangkir tepung and 4 cangkir gula.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to her recipe, and the recipe requires a total of 9 cups (as stated in the problem). So, we need to find out how many cups of flour are left to add. To do this, we divide the total amount required (9 cups) by the amount Mary has already added (3 cups):

9 cups - 3 cups = 6 cups

Therefore, the recipe requires 6 more cups of flour than what Mary has already added.";
Response:  If Mary has already added 10 cangkir tepung (as stated in the question), and she still needs 2 more cangkir tepung to complete the recipe, then we can calculate how many cangkir tepung Mary added as follows: Total amount of tepung needed = 12 cangkir tepung Total amount of tepung added so far = 10 cangkir tepung Amount of tepung left to add = 2 cangkir tepung So, Mary added 2 cangkir tepung to make the kue.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 cangkirk tepung and 62 cangkirk gula to her mixture so far. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already used from the total amount required (9 cangkirk tepung). So, the number of additional cangkirk tepung needed is:  Number of remaining cangkirk tepung = Total amount required - Amount already used = 9 - 3 = 6 cangkirk tepung. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cangkirk tepung to her mixture.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cangkir of sugar to her mixture (she has used 10 cangkir of flour). So, we need to find out how many more cangkir of sugar she needs to add to reach the total amount required in the recipe.  The recipe calls for 14 cangkir of sugar, and Mary has already added 2 cangkir. Therefore, the remaining amount of sugar needed is:

14 - 2 = 12 cangkir
So, Mary needs to add another 12 cangkir of sugar to complete the recipe.";
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cangkir tepung to the mixture. To find out how many more cangkir tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. So, the number of additional cangkir tepung needed is:

Total amount of tepung required = 12 cangkir tepung
Amount of tepung Mary has already added = 11 cangkir tepung
Number of additional cangkir tepung needed = Total amount of tepung required - Amount of tepung Mary has already added
= 12 - 11
= 1
Therefore, Mary needs an additional 1 cangkir tepung to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cangkirk tepung to her mixture so far. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount of tepung required in the recipe.  The recipe requires 10 cangkirk tepung, and Mary has already added 7 cangkirk tepung, so the remaining amount is 3 cangkirk tepung (10 - 7 = 3). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cangkirk tepung to her mixture.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cangkirk tepung to the mixture so far. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount of tepung required in the recipe.  The recipe requires 12 cangkirk tepung, and Mary has already added 2, so she needs to add an additional 10 cangkirk tepung (12 - 2 = 10). Therefore, the answer is 10 cangkirk tepung.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 cangkirk tepung to make the kue mixture. So, we have:

Tepung used = 5 cangkirk
Gula needed = 8 - 5 = 3 cangkirk
Garam needed = 7 - 5 = 2 cangkirk

Now, we need to find out how many more cangkirk of gula than garam Mary needs to add. Since there are 3 cangkirk of gula needed and only 2 cangkirk of garam available, Mary needs to add 1 more cangkirk of gula. Therefore, the answer is:

More gula than garam = 3 - 2 = 1 cangkrik
So, Mary needs to add 1 more cangkirk of gula to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary needs 13 cangkir (cups) of sugar for her recipe and she has already added 2 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar are needed. To do this, we divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount of sugar that Mary has already added: 13 - 2 = 11 cangkir (cups) of sugar remain to be added. Therefore, there are 11 additional cups of sugar that Mary should add to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to her mixture (which is equal to 240 grams). Now we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we divide the total amount of flour required (9 cups) by the amount of flour she has already added (4 cups):  Number of remaining cups = Total amount - Amount already added = 9 - 4 = 5 cups So, Mary needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cangkirk tepung to her mixture so far. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount of tepung required in the recipe.  The recipe requires 9 cangkirk tepung, and Mary has already added 2 cangkirk tepung, so she needs to add an additional 7 cangkirk tepung (9 - 2 = 7).;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cangkirk tepung to make the kue. So, we need to find out how many more cangkirk gula she needs to add. The recipe asks for 5 cangkirk gula plus 14 cangkirk tepung, which means there are 9 cangkirk gula left to be added (5 + 14 = 19). Since Mary has already added 11 cangkirk tepung, she still needs to add 8 more cangkirk gula (9 - 11 = 8). Therefore, the answer is 8 cangkirk gula more than the amount of tepung she has added so far.;
Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cangkirk of sugar and needs 5 more cangkirk of flour than she used for the sugar, then we know that the total amount of flour needed is equal to the number of cangkirk of sugar plus 5.  Therefore, if Mary uses 3 cangkirk of sugar, then the total amount of flour needed is 3 + 5 = 8 cangkirk of flour.;
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added some flour to make the dough. The recipe requires 13 cups of flour, and Mary has already added some. So, we need to find out how many cups of flour she still needs to add. To do this, we divide the total amount of flour required (13 cups) by the amount of flour she has already added (let's call it x cups). This gives us:

x = 13 / x = 13 / 4 = 3.25 cups
So, Mary still needs to add 3.25 cups of flour to complete the recipe.";
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cangkirk tepung and 60 cangkirk gula to her mixture. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount required (14 - 7 = 7). So, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cangkirk tepung to her mixture.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cangkir of sugar and 12 cangkir of flour to her recipe. To find out how many more cangkir of sugar she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe. So, the number of additional cangkir of sugar needed is:  11 - 10 = 1. Therefore, Mary needs to add one more cangkir of sugar to her recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary needs 3 cangkir gula, 10 cangkir tepung, and 15 cangkir garam to make her recipe. She has already added 6 cangkir tepung. So, we need to find out how many more cangkir of tepung she needs to add. To do this, we divide the total amount needed (3 + 10 + 15) by the amount she has already added (6):  Total amount needed = 3 + 10 + 15 = 38 Cangkirk tepung already added = 6 Cangkirk tepung needed = Total amount needed - Amount already added = 38 - 6 = 32 cangkir tepung Therefore, Mary needs an additional 32 cangkir tepung to complete her recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cangkir of flour (since she has used 4 out of the required 9 cangkir). So, we need to find out how many more cangkir of flour are needed. To do this, we divide the remaining amount of ingredients by the amount of flour Mary has already added:  Number of cangkir of flour left = (remaining amount of gula - gula that Mary has added) / number of cangkir of flour Mary has added = (14 - 4) / 4 = 6 cangkir of flour. Therefore, there are 6 additional cangkir of flour that Mary needs to add.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 cangkirk tepung to the mixture so far. To find out how many more cangkirk tepung she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of tepung she has already added from the total amount of tepung required in the recipe.  The recipe requires 7 cangkirk tepung, and Mary has already added 2 cangkirk tepung, so the remaining amount is 7 - 2 = 5 cangkirk tepung. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 cangkirk tepung to complete the recipe.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 cangkirk tepung to make the kue. So, we need to find out how many more cangkirk gula she needs to add.  The recipe requires 11 cangkirk gula for every 6 cangkirk tepung and 9 cangkirk garam. Therefore, if we divide 11 by 6, we get 1.83 (rounded to nearest whole number). Similarly, if we divide 9 by 6, we get 1.5 (rounded to nearest whole number). Now, let's check how much more gula is needed than garam. Since there are 1.5 times more garam than gula required, we need 1.5 x 9 = 13.5 cangkirk gula more than garam. However, since we have already added 12 cangkirk tepung, we only need to add 13 - 12 = 1 cangkirk gula more. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 cangkirk gula.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to her mixture (4/7 = 0.57). To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we need to subtract this amount from the total number of cups required in the recipe (7 - 0.57 = 6.43). So, there are 6 and 4/7 cups of sugar left to be added.;
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 cangkir (cups) of sugar to her mixture. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already used from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe. So, if the recipe requires 12 cangkir of sugar and Mary has already used 10 cangkir, then she still needs to add 2 cangkir (or 2 cups) of sugar. Now, let's convert this quantity into grams using the conversion factor between cups and grams for dry ingredients: 1 cup = 250 grams. Therefore, 2 cups = 500 grams. Since Mary has already used 10 cups or 2500 grams of sugar, she still needs to add 3500 grams / 500 grams per cup = 7 cups or 1700 grams of flour to her mixture.;
Response:  If there are currently 19 families of birds living near the mountain and they migrate for winter, then after 60 more families fly in, the total number of bird families will be:  19 + (60/2) = 35 families of birds live near the mountain during winter.;
Response:  If 7 families of birds flew away for winter, then there are 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds left behind. Therefore, there are 80 families of birds living near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that there are 20 families of birds that fly away for winter and 14 families that stay behind. So, if we divide the total number of families (34) by the number of families that fly away (20), we get: $ \frac{34}{20} = 1.7$ families per gunmount. Therefore, there are approximately 1.7 families of birds living near the mountain at the beginning.;
Response:  If 23 keluarga burung terbang ke Africa and 37 keluarga burung terbang ke Asia, then the total number of families that flew away is 23 + 37 = 60. So, there are 85 - 60 = 25 families left near the mountain.;
Response:  If 42 families of birds migrate to Africa and 31 families migrate to Asia, then we have:  Number of families that migrated to Africa = 42 Number of families that migrated to Asia = 31 Now, let's find out how many more families migrated to Africa than to Asia: Difference between number of families that migrated to Africa and number of families that migrated to Asia = 42 - 31 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more families that migrated to Africa than to Asia.;
Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain. If 47 families fly to Africa and 94 families fly to Asia, then we can calculate the number of families flying to Asia as follows: Number of families flying to Asia = Total number of families - Number of families flying to Africa Total number of families = 38 + (47 x 100) / 2 = 38 + 23.5 = 61.5 Therefore, there are 61.5 families of birds flying to Asia.;
Response:  If 38 families of birds fly to Africa and 80 families fly to Asia, then the total number of bird families flying away is:  38 + 80 = 118. So, there are 118 bird families that will migrate for winter.;
Response:  We know that there are already 87 families of birds living near the mountain when summer is almost over and most animals migrate back to their native lands. If 18 new bird families join them, how many families of birds now live near the mountain?  Therefore, the answer is 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds living near the mountain.;
Response:  We know that there are 49 families of birds living near the mountain during the summer season. Then, we have to calculate how many families will migrate for winter and how many new families will come from the Arctic region.  Migrating families = 59 (since 59 families will migrate) New families = 24 (since 24 families will come from the Arctic region) Total families left = Migrating families + New families - Families that stayed = 49 + 24 - 49 = 0 So, there are no families of birds left near the mountain after the migration for winter.;
Response:  We know that there are initially 41 families of birds living near the mountain. If most of them migrate to warmer places for winter, then we can assume that only a fraction (let's say 3/5) of these families will remain in the area around the mountain. So, the number of families of birds remaining near the mountain after migration is:  41 x (3/5) = 24 families.;
Response:  We know that there are 86 families of birds flying away for winter from near the mountain. If there were 45 families living near the mountain initially, then how many more families flew away for winter than lived nearby at first? So, the difference between the number of families that fled and the number that lived nearby is equal to the total number of families that flew away. Therefore, we can write: Number of families that flew away = Total number of families that flew away - Number of families that lived nearby at first. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of families that flew away = 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, there were 41 more families of birds that flew away for winter than lived nearby at first.;
"Response:  We know that 35 families of birds flew to Asia and 62 families flew to Africa. So, we have:

Number of families flying to Africa = 62
Number of families flying to Asia = 35
Now, let's find out how many more families flew to Africa than to Asia:
Difference between number of families flying to Africa and number of families flying to Asia = 62 - 35 = 27
So, there are 27 more families of birds that flew to Africa than to Asia.";
Response:  Firstly, there are 3 families of birds that live near the mountain. Then, 26 new families of birds come from the Arctic to live near the mountain during winter while 2 families of birds fly further south for the winter. So, the number of families of birds left near the mountain is 3 - 26 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 families of birds left near the mountain.;
Response:  If Paul got 253 pensils as gift and he lost or gave away 70 of them, then he has 183 pensils left. So, the answer is 183.;
"Response:  We know that Paul received x pensils for his birthday and he lost or gave away 551 of them. So, we can write an equation as follows:  x - 551 = 177  Now, let's solve for ""x"" (the number of pensils Paul received):  Subtracting 551 from both sides gives us:  x = 177 + 551  Simplifying this equation gives us:  x = 728  Therefore, Paul received 728 pensils for his birthday.";
Response:  If Paul received 440 pensils for his birthday and he gave away 111 pensils to his friends during the school year while losing 106 pensils, then we can calculate how many pensils he has left as follows:  Number of pensils Paul had at first = 440 - 111 = 329 Number of pensils Paul lost = 106 Penlsis Paul has now = 329 - 106 = 223 So, Paul has 223 pensils left.;
Response:  If Paul received 65 pensils and gave away 213 pensils to his friends during the school year while he lost 16 pensils, then we can calculate as follows:  Total number of pensils = Received pensils + Gave pensils - Lost pensils = 65 + 213 - 16 = 244 pensils So, there are 244 pensils in total.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received 589 pensils as gift for his birthday and he gave away 571 pensils to his friends during the school year while losing 161 pensils. So far so good! Now let's calculate how many more pensils he gave away than he lost:  Number of pensils given away = 571 - 161 = 410 pensils  Therefore, the number of additional pensils Paul gave away is 410 pensils.;
Response:  If Paul gave away 90 pensils and lost 412 pensils, then he has 90 - 412 = -322 pensils left. Since he received 110 pensils as gift, he now has -322 + 110 = 88 pensils left. So, there are 88 more pensils that he gave to his friends than he had initially.;
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 pensils and lost 558 pensils, so he has 332 pensils left. Now we want to find out how many pensils he can get for his birthday. To do this, we need to divide the number of pensils he has left (332) by the number of pensils he wants to give away (563). So, the answer is: 332 / 563 = 0.60 or approximately 1/1.7. Therefore, Paul can get around 1/3 of the total number of pensils he had originally, which is 332 pensils, for his birthday.;
Response:  We know that Paul has 492 pensils left after giving away 52 pensils to his friends. So he had 492 - 52 = 440 pensils initially. Now we are told that he lost 535 pensils. Therefore, the number of pensils he has now is 440 - 535 = -195 pensils. Since it can't be negative, the correct answer is 0 pensils.;
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 pensils and used 66 of them. So he has 455 pensils left (521 - 66 = 455). Now we are asked how many pensils he had at the end of the year. The answer is 154, which means that 301 pensils were either lost or given away (455 - 154 = 301).;
Response:  We know that Paul got 531 pensils and used 38 of them. So he has 493 pensils left (531 - 38 = 493). Now we are asked how many more pensils he has than pencils. Therefore, the difference between the number of pensils he has and the number of pencils is equal to the number of pencils he has. In other words, the difference between 493 and 38 is equal to 455 (493 - 38 = 455). So there are 455 more pensils in his possession than pencils.;
Response:  We know that Paul got 601 pensils and used 406 of them. So, he has 205 pensils left (601 - 406 = 205). But then we are told that he didn't lose any pensils, so all 205 pensils he had at the end of the year were still there. Therefore, the number of pensils he has now is 205.;
Response:  We know that Paul received x pensils for his birthday and he had y pensils left after giving some away or losing them. Since there are only 315 pensils in total, we can set up an equation as follows:  x + y = 315... (1) Now we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract y from both sides of Equation (1): x = 315 - y... (2) Now we have found out how many pensils Paul received for his birthday!;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul received 267 pensils as gift for his birthday and he lost 231 pensils during the school year. So, the number of pensils he had left is equal to 267 - 231 = 36 pensils. Now, we are asked how many more pensils did he give away besides the ones he lost. We can find this out by subtracting the number of pensils he gave away (308) from the total number of pensils he had left (36). Therefore, the answer is 308 - 36 = 272 additional pensils that Paul gave away beside the ones he lost.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 457 erasable blocks and 320 pens at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he only had 523 remaining while not losing any of his erasable blocks. So, we can deduce that Paul used 193 (457 - 523) erasable blocks during the year. Now, let's calculate how many more pens he has than he started with: Number of pens left = Total number of pens - Number of pens used = 320 - 193 = 127 Therefore, there are 127 more pens in Paul's possession now than he had at the start of the year.;
Response:  If Pelayan had 11 customers initially and after some time he still has 3 customers left, then we can calculate how many customers he lost as follows: Number of customers lost = Initial number of customers - Remaining number of customers After some time = 11 - 3 = 8 Customers have been lost during that period. Therefore, there are 8 customers who stopped doing business with Pelayan over time.;
Response:  If Pelayan has 3 customers initially and after some time he still has 4 customers, then there must have been 1 customer who left him during that time. So, the number of customers who left is 1.;
Response:  At first, Pelayan had 9 customers (Pelayan punya 9 pelanggan). After 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers (Setelah 9 pelanggan pergi dia masih memiliki 12 pelanggan). So, at the beginning, Pelayan had 9 + 12 = 21 customers.;
Response:  If Pelayan has 14 customers initially and 5 of them are left, then we can calculate how many customers he still has as follows: Number of customers remaining = Total number of customers - Number of customers who left = 14 - 5 = 9 So, Pelayan still has 9 customers.;
Response:  At first, Seorang Pelayan has 13 customers. Then he gets 4 new customers, so now he has 13 + 4 = 17 customers in total. So, there are 17 - 9 = 8 remaining customers. Therefore, there are 8 customers left.;
Response:  At first, Pelayan had 12 customers (Pelayan punya). Then, 15 of his customers left him (15 pelanggan pergi), leaving him with no customers for a while. However, he managed to gain 14 new customers (pelanggan baru) during this time period. Therefore, at the end of the period, Pelayan still has some number of customers, which we can find out by subtracting the number of customers who left from the total number of customers he initially had. So, the final answer is:  Number of customers Pelayan still has = Initial number of customers - Number of customers who left = 12 - 15 = -3;
Response:  If Pelayan had 3 customers initially and then gained 5 new customers, he would have 8 customers in total (including both old and new ones). So, the number of new customers that came to him is 5 - 3 = 2.;
Response:  At first, Pelayan had 8 customers (C1). Then he lost some of them (C2), but still had 5 customers left. After that, he gained new customers (C3) and now has 99 new customers in total. So, the number of customers Pelayan still has is: C1 - C2 + C3 = 8 - x + 99 =? Where x is the number of customers Pelayan lost. Solving for x, we get: x = 5 So, there are 5 customers left after Pelayan lost some of his original customers. Therefore, the final answer is: C1 - C2 + C3 = 8 - 5 + 99 = 46.;
Response:  At first, Pelayan had 12 customers. Then he lost some of them and was left with 14 customers. Later, he gained 10 new customers, so now he has 24 customers in total (14 + 10 = 24). Therefore, the number of customers that Pelayan currently has is 24.;
Response:  At first, Dan had $2 from buying the ice cream for $2. Then he got $3 as change after buying the candy bar for $1. So, at the beginning, Dan had $2 + $3 = $5.;
Response:  We know that Dan has $ 4 and he spent $ 3 to buy permen. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $ 4 = $ 3 + x, where x is the cost of one package of permen. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract $ 3 from both sides of the equation: $ 4 - $ 3 = x. Solving for x, we get: x = $ 1. Therefore, the cost of each package of permen is $ 1.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $ 4 to buy 1 permen. So he has $ 4 - $ 3 = $ 1 left after buying one permen. Now, he bought 99 more permen with the same price of $ 3 each. Therefore, he spent $ 99 x $ 3 = $ 297 for all 99 permen. So now he has $ 1 - $ 297 = -$ 296 left.  Hence, there is no money left and Dan owes $ 296.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dan spent $ 3. Then he bought two ice creams at $ 4 each, so he paid a total of $ 8 for both ice creams. Therefore, the price of one ice cream is $ 8 / 2 = $ 4. So, the price of each ice cream is $ 4.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 2 to buy some candy. Then he bought several boxes of gum at a cost of $ 6 each. So, in total, Dan spent $ 2 + (number of boxes x $ 6) = $ 2 + 6 = $ 8. Therefore, Dan bought 8 boxes of gum.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 7 to buy something. Then he bought perment for $ 2 and chocolate for $ 3. So, total amount of money that Dan spent is $ 7 + $ 2 + $ 3 = $ 12. Therefore, there are $ 12 - $ 7 = $ 5 left over after buying those things.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 4 to buy the permen. Then he bought cokelat for $ 6. So in total, Dan spent $ 4 + $ 6 = $ 10. Therefore, the amount of money that Dan spent to buy permen and cokelat is $ 10.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 2 to buy permen. Then he bought cokelat for $ 3. So in total, Dan spent $ 2 + $ 3 = $ 5. Therefore, Dan spent $ 5 to buy both permen and cokelat.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 5 to buy something (permen). Then he bought cokelat for $ 3 more than what he spent on permen. So, if he spent $ 5 on permen, then he spent $ 5 + $ 3 = $ 8 on cokelat. Therefore, Dan spent $ 8 on cokelat instead of $ 5 on permen.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 4 for something else. Then he bought ice cream at $ 8. Finally, his friends gave him $ 5 more than what was left after buying ice cream. So, if we subtract $ 4 from $ 8, we get $ 4 as the amount that Dan had left after buying ice cream. Now, if we add $ 5 to it, we get $ 9 as the total amount of money that Dan received from his friends. Therefore, the correct answer is $ 9.;
Response:  If Dan has $3 after buying a packet of candy and he had $4 at the beginning, then we can say that the cost of one packet of candy is $ (4 - 3) = $1.;
Response:  If Dan pays $4 for each pack of gum and he buys 10 packs, then he spends a total of $4 x 10 = $40. So, there is $40 left over after making the purchase.;
Response:  If Dan pays $ 3 for a total of $ 4 to buy two ice creams with equal cost, then each ice cream costs half of the total amount paid by Dan, or $ 4 / 2 = $ 2 per ice cream. Therefore, the price of each ice cream is $ 2.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 5 to buy candy. Then he bought perme for $ 7. So in total, Dan spent $ 5 + $ 7 = $ 12. Therefore, Dan spent $ 12 to buy both candy and perme.;
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 4 to buy something. Then he bought candy for $ 7 and then he bought gum for $ 2. So in total, Dan spent $ 4 + $ 7 + $ 2 = $ 13. Therefore, Dan spent more money buying candy than he did buying gum.;
Response:  If Paul has 115 books and he sells 78 of them at his garage sale, then he is left with how many books?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had. So, the answer is:  Books remaining = Total books - Number of books sold  Books remaining = 115 - 78  Books remaining = 37;
Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in his storage, he has 105 left. So, if we subtract the number of books sold (137) from the total number of books he had (punya), we get the remaining number of books he had at first:  Number of books he had at first = Total number of books - Number of books sold = ...;
Response:  We know that Paul has 108 books in total and he sells some of them at a garage sale. After selling some books, he has 62 books left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left after sale Now, let's solve for the number of books sold: Number of books sold = 108 - 62 = 46 books Therefore, Paul sold 46 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 50 books and after buying some at a garage sale he was left with 151 books. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of books Paul bought = Total number of books - Initial number of books  In this case, the total number of books is 151 (the remaining books after buying some) and the initial number of books is 50 (the number of books Paul initially had). Therefore, we can substitute these values in the equation to get:  Number of books Paul bought = 151 - 50  Number of books Paul bought = 101 books  So, Paul bought 101 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  Initially, Paul had 2 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 150 new books. So, initially, Paul had x = 2 books. Now, we know that after selling some books, he has 58 books left. Therefore, the number of books Paul sold is equal to the difference between his initial number of books and his current number of books: x - 58 = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 60. So, Paul sold 60 books.;
Response:  At first, Paul had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. We don't know how many he sold or bought after that, but we do know that he has 15 books left now. So, to find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he has now from the total number of books he had initially: 21 - 15 = 6. Therefore, Paul sold 6 books. Now, let's see how many new books he bought: 42 - 6 = 36. So, Paul bought 36 new books.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul initially had 71 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. We don't know how many he sold, but let's assume it was x books. Then, after selling those books, he bought 38 new ones. So, his current number of books is:  Initial books = 71 Books sold = x New books = 38 Total books =? To find out the total number of books Paul has now, we need to add up all these values: Total books = Initial books + Books sold + New books = 71 + x + 38 = 116 Therefore, Paul bought 40 more books than he sold (x - 40).;
Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 pens initially. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 66 books left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:  Books = Initial books - Number sold at garage sale  In this case, the initial number of books was 108, and the number sold at the garage sale is unknown. To find out how many books were sold, we need to subtract the number of books left after the garage sale from the initial number of books. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of books sold = 108 - 66 = 42 books.;
Response:  Paul initially had 51 books and 106 pens. He sold some of them at the garage sale, but we don't know how many. After selling those, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens. So, to find out how many pens he sold, we can subtract the number of pens he had after the garage sale from the initial number of pens he had:  Number of pens sold = Initial number of pens - Number of pens after garage sale  Number of pens after garage sale = 106 - 14  Number of pens sold = 106 - 14 = 92 Therefore, Paul sold 92 pens at the garage sale.;
"Response:  If Paul had initially 136 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he must have had fewer books after selling them.  We know that he sold 27 books at the garage sale, so let's assume that he had x books left after selling those 27 books.  Since he started with 136 books, we can set up the equation:

x + 27 = 136... (1)

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation:

x = 109... (2)

So, Paul had 109 books left after selling 27 books at the garage sale.";
Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave away 39 to his friend. So he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left with him. Then he sold some of these books at the garage sale, which we are asked to find out. Therefore, the number of books he sold is equal to the number of books he has left with him minus the number of books he gave away. Using this formula, we can calculate the number of books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = 95 - 39 = 56 books. So, Paul sold 56 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  We know that Paul had 95 books and 153 pens initially. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he has 13 books and 23 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Number of books left after sale Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of books sold = 95 - 13 = 82 books Therefore, Paul sold 82 books at the garage sale.;
Response:  Paul had initially 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some of his books at a garage sale, he was left with 113 books. Since he sold some pens as well, we can assume that he has fewer pens now than before. So, the number of pens he sold = Number of pens he had - Number of pens he has after selling books.  We know that he has 19 pens left after selling books. Therefore, the number of pens he sold = 19 - 42 = 23 pens.;
Response:  We know that Ada had 10 marigolds in her vase initially. Then, Jessica cut off 8 more marigolds from the flower garden and placed them in the same vase with Ada's marigolds. So, now there are total 10 + 8 = 18 marigolds in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 18.;
Response:  At first, there were 10 marigolds in the vase (Ada 10 mawar di dalam vas pada awalnya). Then, Jessica cut 6 more marigolds from the flower garden and added them to the vase (Jessica memotong 6 mawar lagi dari kebun bunga dan menaruhnya di dalam vas). So, now there are 23 marigolds in the vase (Sekarang ada 23 mawar di dalam vas). Therefore, the answer is 10.;
Response:  There are 4 mawar that Jessica threw away initially and then she picked up 4 new ones from the flower garden to add in the vase. So, there are 4 + 4 = 8 mawar inside the vase initially. Then, she cut some more mawar from the flower garden to add in the vase, but we don't know how many exactly. Therefore, the total number of mawar inside the vase now is 8 +? = 23. To find out the exact number of mawar that Jessica cut from the flower garden, we need to subtract the initial number of mawar (8) from the final number of mawar (23). Hence, the answer is 15.;
Response:  Firstly, Jessica threw away 33 marigolds from the vase. Then she cut some new marigolds from the flower garden to put into the vase. Now there are 17 marigolds in the vase. So, the number of marigolds that Jessica cut from those she threw away is 33 - 17 = 16.;
"Response: 
Ada 21 mawar di dalam vas at first. Then, Jessica removed 34 mawar from the vase and cut some new ones from her garden to put in the vase. Now there are 15 mawar left in the vase. So, how many more mawar did she remove than she added?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of mawar removed = 34 - 15 = 19 Number of mawar added = 0 (since we said that she didn't add any new mawar) Therefore, the difference between the number of mawar removed and added is 19 mawar.";
Response:  We know that there are initially 7 mawar in the vase and Jessica cuts some more from her flower garden which has a total of 59 mawar. So, after she cuts them, there are 20 mawar left in the vase. To find out how many mawar Jessica cut, we can subtract the number of mawar in the vase before she cut them (7) from the total number of mawar in her garden (59). Therefore, the answer is 52 mawar.;
Response:  We know that there are initially 13 marigolds in the vase and Jessica cuts off some more from her flower garden which has a total of 12 marigolds. So, now there are 21 marigolds in the vase altogether. To find out how many marigolds were left in the garden, we need to subtract the number of marigolds in the vase from the total number of marigolds in the garden. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of marigolds left in the garden = Total number of marigolds in the garden - Number of marigolds in the vase = 12 + 13 = 25 marigolds.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 mawar and 62 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of them from her garden. Afterward, there are 17 mawar and 96 anggrek in the vase. So, we can calculate how many mawar Jessica cut as follows: Number of mawar cut = Total number of mawar - Initial number of mawar = 17 - 15 = 2 Therefore, Jessica cut 2 mawar from the original total of 15.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 mawar and 2 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of the flowers from her garden. Afterwards, there are 10 mawar and 21 anggrek in the vase. So, we can conclude that Jessica cut 2 mawar and 3 anggrek (2 x 3 = 6). Therefore, the answer is 6.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 mawar and 3 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of them from her garden. So, after she did that, there were fewer mawar and anggrek in the vase. But we don't know exactly how many fewer because the question doesn't give us that information. However, since there are now 12 mawar and 2 anggrek in the vase, we can infer that the number of mawar is greater than the number of anggrek. Specifically, the ratio of mawar to anggrek in the vase right now is 12 : 2 = 6 : 1. Therefore, for every one anggrek in the vase, there are 6 mawar.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 mau and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of them from her flower garden. Now, there are 11 mau and 20 orchids in the vase. So, we can calculate how many more orchids than mau are left as follows: Number of orchids = 20 - 11 = 9 More orchids than mau are left in the vase.;
Response:  If there were originally 3 marigolds in the vase and Jessica cut 16 more from the flower garden to add to it, then the total number of marigolds in the vase now is:  Number of original marigolds = 3 Newly added marigolds = 16 Total number of marigolds = Original + newly added = 3 + 16 = 19 So, there are 19 marigolds in the vase now.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 mawar and 84 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of the flowers from her garden. Afterward, there are 91 anggreck and 14 mawar in the vase. So, we can calculate how many mawar Jessica cut as follows: Number of mawar = Total number of mawar - Initial number of mawar = 14 - 13 = 1 Therefore, Jessica cut 1 mawar from the original 13 mawar in her garden.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 16 mau and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of them from her flower garden. Now, there are 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, we can deduce that Jessica cut 9 orchids (7 - 3 = 9).;
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 mawar and 20 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of the flowers from her garden. Afterward, there are 21 anggreck and 22 mawar in the vase. So, we can calculate the number of mawar more than anggreck as follows: Number of mawar more = Total number of mawar - Total number of anggreck Total number of mawar = 22 - 20 = 2 Number of mawar more = 2 Therefore, there are 2 more mawar than anggreck in the vase now.;
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 mawar and 6 anggrek in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some of them from her garden. So, after she did that, there were fewer mawar and anggrek in the vase. But we don't know exactly how many fewer because the question doesn't give us that information. However, since there are now 13 anggreck and 3 mawar in the vase, we can infer that there must have been at least 4 more anggreck than mawar before (since 13 - 3 = 10). Therefore, there are currently 4 more anngreck than mawar in the vase (4 > 3).;
Response:  The original length of Rambut Robin was 17 inches (in ci). Then, she cut some inches off her hair. Now, the new length of her hair is 13 inches (in ci). To find out how many inches she cut off, we can subtract the new length from the original length: 13 - 17 = -4 inches. So, Rambut Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.;
Response:  Before Robin cut his hair, it was 20 inches long. After he cut it, it is now 10 inches long. So, to find out how long it was before he cut it, we need to subtract the length of his current hair from its original length:  $ \text{Original length} = \text{Current length} + \text{Length cut off} $  In this case, $\text{Original length} = 20 - 10 = 10$ inches. Therefore, Robin's hair was originally $10\text{ inches}$ long before he cut it.;
Response:  At first, Robin had long hair that was 16 inches (in ci). Then she cut it to 11 inches. Later, her hair grew again and reached 12 inches. So, how long is Robin's hair now?  Answer:  Now Robin's hair is 12 + 11 = 23 inches long.;
Response:  If Rambut Robin was originally 19 inches long and then grew an additional 18 inches, how much longer is her hair now? To find out, we need to subtract the original length from the new length: New length = Original length - Old length = 19 - 18 = 1 inch So, Rambut Robin's hair is now 1 inch longer than it was before.;
Response:  If Robin cut 13 inches from her hair and it was originally 14 inches long, then now it is 14 - 13 = 1 inch long.;
Response:  At first, Rambut Robin was 14 inches long and then he cut it to 8 inches. So, his hair length before cutting was 14 - 8 = 6 inches. After cutting, his new length is 20 - 8 = 12 inches. Therefore, Rambut Robin's current length of hair is 12 inches.;
Response:  If Danny has 12 bottle caps in his collection and he finds 53 more bottle caps in the park, then the total number of bottle caps that Danny now has is:  12 + 53 = 65   So, Danny now has 65 bottle caps.;
Response:  If Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection and he finds some more bottle caps in the park, then the total number of bottle caps he has is now 21 + x, where x is the number of bottle caps he found in the park. Since he found 53 bottle caps in the park, we can write: 21 + x = 53. Solving for x, we get: x = 32. So, Danny found 32 additional bottle caps in the park.;
Response:  At first, Danny had collected 63 bottle caps. Then he threw away 51 old bottle caps. So now he has 33 bottle caps left in his collection. Therefore, at the beginning, Danny had 63 bottle caps.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 36 bottle caps and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 new bottle caps in his collection now. To find out how many bottle caps Danny found in the park besides the ones he threw away, we can subtract the number of old bottle caps from the total number of new bottle caps:  Number of bottle caps found in the park = New bottle caps - Old bottle caps = 22 - 35 = -13 Therefore, Danny found 13 bottle caps in the park besides the ones he threw away.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 bottle caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he has 42 new bottle caps now. To find out how many bottle caps Danny threw away besides those found in the park, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he threw away: 63 - 30 = 33 Therefore, Danny threw away 33 bottle caps besides those found in the park.;
Response:  At first, Danny gathered 22 tutup botol and 8 bungkus in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 items at the beginning. Then, he found more tutup botol and bungkus, which increased his collection to 28 tutup botol and 63 bungkus. Therefore, the number of tutup botol that Danny had at the beginning was 30.;
Response:  At first, Danny gathered 22 bottle caps and 30 boxes in the park. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 boxes in his collection. So initially, Danny had 39 (22 + 30) boxes.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 tutup botol and 14 bungkus from the park. So far, he has 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection. Then, he found 7 more tutup botol and 86 more bungkus. Therefore, the total number of tutup botol found in the park is 44 + 7 = 51.  So, there were 51 tutup botol found in the park.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 11 tub caps and 28 boxes in the park. So he has 68 tub caps and 51 boxes now. To find out how many more boxes than tub caps Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of tub caps from the total number of boxes:  Number of boxes > Tub caps = 51 - 11 = 40 Therefore, there are 40 more boxes than tub caps that Danny found in the park.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny collected 71 tutup botol and 24 bungkus in the park. So, he had a total of 95 items (71 tutup botol + 24 bungkus). Then, he gave some of them to his friends as gifts, so he only has 28 tutup botol and 16 bungkus left in his collection. Therefore, the number of tutup botol that Danny currently has is 28.;
Response:  We know that Danny initially collected 10 tutup botol and 62 bungkus from the park. So, he had a total of 72 items (10 tutup botol + 62 bungkus). Then, he found more tutup botol and bungkus in his collection, which brought the total number to 27 tutup botol and 43 bungkus. Therefore, the number of bungkus botol that Danny currently has is 43.;
Response:  At first, Danny had collected 100 tutup botol (since he lost 34). Now, he has 25 in his collection. So initially, Danny had 100 - 25 = 75 tutup botol.;
Response:  If Danny had 25 tutup botol in his collection before finding some more in the park, then he found x new tutup botol in the park. Since he now has 32 tutup botol in his collection altogether, we can write an equation:  Number of tutup botol Danny found = x  In other words, x is the number of tutup botol that Danny found in the park after having 25 in his collection already. So, x = 7 (since 32 - 25 = 7). Therefore, Danny found 7 additional tutup botol in the park.;
Response:  At first, Danny had 60 old bottles in his collection and he found 58 new ones. So, now he has 60 + 58 = 118 bottles in total. Therefore, Danny initially had 118 bottles.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 6 old caps and threw away 6 of them in the park. So he has 6 - 6 = 0 new caps. Now we are asked how many caps Danny found in the park besides the ones he already had. This means we need to find out how many caps were left after Danny picked up the 6 old caps and threw away the 6 new caps. Therefore, the number of caps Danny found in the park is equal to the total number of caps minus the number of caps he already had (6) plus the number of caps he threw away (6). Using this logic, we can conclude that Danny found 0 + 6 = 6 caps in the park.  So, the answer is 6.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 54 old bottles in the garden and then found 48 new bottle caps. So, he now has 52 bottle caps in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps Danny threw away besides those found in the garden, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he found from the total number of bottle caps he had before finding any new ones. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of bottle caps thrown away = Total number of bottle caps before finding new ones - Number of bottle caps found in the garden = 52 - 48 = 4.;
Response:  At first, Danny gathered 82 bottle caps and 29 corks in the park. Now he has 42 capstoppers and 61 boxes in his collection. So initially, Danny had 82 + 29 = 111 items. Therefore, the number of bottle caps that Danny had at the beginning is 111 - 42 = 70.;
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 bungkus and 39 tutup botol. Then he collected more bungkus and found 16 additional tutup botol. So, at this point, Danny has 66 + 16 = 82 bungkus and 39 + 16 = 55 tutup botol. Therefore, initially, Danny had 82 bungkus.;
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 bungkus and 50 tutup botol from the park. So far, he has 21 tutup botol and 52 bungkus in his collection. To find out how many tutup botol were found in the park, we need to subtract the number of tutup botol Danny already had from the total number of tutup botol found in the park. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of tutup botol found in the park = Total number of tutup botol - Number of tutup botol already owned by Danny = 50 - 21 = 29;
"Response:  We know that Danny collected 65 bungkus and 5 tutup botol from the park. Then he found 31 tutup botol and 9 bungkus in his collection. So, the number of bungkus more than the number of tutup botol that Danny found in the park is:  
$$ \boxed{34} $$";
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny collected 58 tutup botol and 25 bungkus in the park. So, he had a total of 58 + 25 = 83 items initially. Then, he found 11 more bungkus and 12 more tutup botol in his collection. Therefore, the current number of tutup botol owned by Danny is 83 + 12 = 95.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny collected 15 tutup botol and 18 bungkus in the park. So, he has a total of 15 + 18 = 33 items. Then, he found additional 67 bungkus and 35 tutup botol in his collection. Therefore, the number of bungkus botol that Danny currently has is 33 + 35 = 68 bungkus.  So, the answer to the question is 68.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Steven. So if Jake has 17 persimmons, then Steven must have 28 persimmons (17 + 11 = 28).;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 7 persimmons. Since Steven has more persimmons than Jake, we can say that x < 14 (since 14 is greater than x). Moreover, since Jill has 15 persimmons and Steven has more than Jake, we can say that Jake has less than 15 persimmons. Therefore, the number of persimmons that Jake has is between 0 and 14 inclusive.  So, the answer is any integer between 0 and 14.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 persimmons less than Steven, who has 13 more persimmons than Jill. So, if we subtract 18 from 13, we get 5 (the number of persimmons that Jill has). Therefore, Jill has 5 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 3 apples (since he has 3 more apples than Jake). Now, we also know that Steven has more apples than Jill. So, if Steven has x + 3 apples, then Jill has x - 2 apples (since she has 2 fewer apples than Steven). Therefore, the number of apples that Jake has is equal to the difference between the number of apples that Jill has and the number of apples that Steven has. In other words, Jake has 3 less apples than Jill. So, the answer is 3.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 persimmons less than Steven, who has 11 more persimmons than Jill. So, if we write it mathematically, we can say:
Jake has x persimmons.
Steven has x + 11 persimmons.
Jill has x - 12 persimmons.
Now, we need to find out how many persimmons Jill has more than Jake. To do this, we subtract the number of persimmons Jake has from the number of persimmons Jill has:
Jill has x - 12 = 9 persimmons more than Jake.
So, Jill has 9 more persimmons than Jake.";
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 7 but less than 9 persimmons. So, he must have exactly 8 persimmons. Therefore, Jake has 8 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 more persimmons than Steven and 8 more persimmons than Jill. So, if we let S be the number of persimmons Steven has, then Jake has S + 7 = 25 persimmons (since he has 7 more than Steven). Similarly, Jill has J ill + 8 = x persimmons (since she has 8 more than Jake). Now, we are told that Steven has 17 persimmons. Therefore, we can set up the equation: S + 7 = 25 Jill + 8 = 17 Substituting S = 17 from the problem statement into these equations gives us: 17 + 7 = 25 23 = 17 Solving for Jill's persimmon count, we get: Jill has 23 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Jake has more than 9 persimmons and less than 18 persimmons compared to Steven. So, if we subtract 9 from 18, we get 9. Therefore, Steven has 9 persimmons more than Jill.;
Response:  We know that Steven has more than 18 persimmons and Jill has less than 6 persimmons. So, if we subtract the number of persimmons owned by Jill from the total number of persimmons owned by Steven, we will get the number of persimmons owned by Jake. Therefore, the answer is:  Jake owns 24 persimmons (Steven - Jill).;
"Response:  We know that:
Jake has fewer than 5 apples than Steven.
Steven has more than 18 apples than Jill.
Jill has 87 apples.
So, we can write an equation based on these statements:
Let x be the number of apples Jake has. Since Jake has fewer than 5 apples than Steven, we know that Steven has at least 5 + 1 = 6 more apples than Jake. Therefore, Jake has x - 6 = 3 less apples than Steven. Now, let's compare how many apples Jill has to Jake and Steven:
Jill has 87 apples, which is greater than both Jake (x) and Steven (6 + 5 = 11). So, if Jake has 3 less apples than Steven, then Jake must have 11 - 3 = 8 apples.
Therefore, the difference in the number of apples between Jill and Jake is 87 - 8 = 79 apples.";
Response:  We know that:  • Jake has 16 persimmons less than Steven. So, if Steven has x persimmons, Jake has x - 16 persimmons.  • Jill has 12 persimmons more than Jake. So, if Jake has x - 16 persimmons, Jill has x + 12 persimmons. Therefore, the difference in number of persimmons between Jill and Jake is:  x + 12 - (x - 16) = 7  So, Jill has 7 more persimmons than Jake.;
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 19 apples. Since Jake has more oranges than Steven, we can say that Jake has x - 79 oranges. Therefore, Jake has 12 less oranges than Steven. So, Jake has 79 oranges.  Now, let's substitute the values in the equation:  x = 79 (Jake's oranges)  Subtracting 19 from both sides gives us:  x - 19 = 50 (Steven's oranges)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 39 (Jake's apples);
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steve. So, Jake must have at least 3 more apples than he does oranges. Therefore, if Jake has x apples, then he must also have 3x oranges. Now we are given that Jake has 13 less oranges than Steve. This means that Jake has 3(13) = 39 oranges in total. Since Jake has 13 fewer oranges than Steve, Jake must have 39 - 13 = 26 oranges. So, Jake has 26 apples and 39 oranges in total.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 less apples than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven has oranges. So, if Steven has x apples of oranges, then Jake has x - 6 apples of oranges. Now we are told that Steven has 17 apples of oranges in total, so Jake must have 17 + 8 = 25 apples of oranges in total. Therefore, the number of apples that Steven has is 25 - 6 = 19.  So, Steven has 19 more apples than Jake.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less apples than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we write it in equation form, we have:
Jake = Steven - 3 + 10
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:
Jake = 12 + 15 - 3
= 30
So, there are 30 apples more than persik that Steven has.";
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x persimmons where x is between 0 and 12 (since Jill has none). Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many persimmons Jake has: Since Steven has 12 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven, we can say that Jake's persimmon count is less than or equal to 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, Jake has 8 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 persimmons and Jake has fewer than 18. So, Jake must have 17 or fewer persimmons. Since Jill has more persimmons than Jake, she must have at least 18 - 17 = 1 persimmon more than Jake, which is equal to 19 persimmons. Therefore, Jill has 19 persimmons.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 persimmons and Jake has fewer than Steven. So, Jake must have at least 19 - 12 = 7 persimmons more than Steven. Therefore, Jake has 19 + 7 = 26 persimmons in total.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 persimmons and Jake has 6 less than Steven, so Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 persimmons.  We also know that Jill has 3 more persimmons than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 persimmons. Therefore, Jill has 11 persimmons.;
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples and Steven has y persimmons, then we can write an equation as follows:
Jake + Steven = 100 (total number of fruits)
We also know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, so we can write another equation:
x - y = 84
Now, let's solve for y (the number of persimmons). To do this, subtract x from both sides of the second equation:
y = x - 84
Substituting the value given in the question, we get:
y = 86
So, Steven has 86 persimmons. Now, to find out how many apples Jake has, we can use the first equation:
Jake + Steven = 100
Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, so he must have:
Jake = Steven + 84
Jake has 84 apples.";
"Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has less than x apples.  Since Steven has 8 apples and 12 oranges, we can write an equation:
x - 8 = 12
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 20
So, Jake has 20 apples.";
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 less apples than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven has oranges. So if Steven has x oranges, then Jake has x - 8 apples. Now we are told that Steven has 11 oranges and Jake has 10 more than Steven, so Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 oranges. Therefore, the number of apples that Steven has is 21 - 8 = 13 apples.;
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 less apples than Steven and 4 more apples than Steven has oranges. So, if Steven has x apples, then Jake has 3x - 4 = 2x apples. Since Steven has 19 apples in total, we can set up the equation: 2x = 19. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Steven has 9 more apples than Jake.;
Response:  If Ada has $78 in her wallet and she spends $15 at the supermarket, then she will have $63 left after making that purchase. So, Ada has $63.;
Response:  If Olivia spends $78 at the supermarket and she has $33 left, then she must have had $101 initially (the amount she spent minus what she has left). So, the answer is $101.;
"Response: 
Ada $100 in Olivia's wallet to start with. 
She withdraws $148 from an ATM, so now there is $100 + $148 = $248 in her wallet. 
After visiting the supermarket, she has $248 - $159 = $89 left in her wallet. Therefore, Olivia spent $89 at the supermarket.";
"Response: 
Ada $3 in Olivia's pocket initially. 
She collected $49 from an ATM later.  So far, she has $52 ($3 + $49). 
After visiting the supermarket, there were $49 left. Therefore, the amount of money that Olivia collected at the ATM is equal to the amount of money she spent at the supermarket.  In other words, $49 = $49.  So, no change occurred during the transaction.";
"Response: 
Ada $53 in Olivia's pocket at first. Then she got $91 from an ATM. After that, she spent $14 at the supermarket. So, how much money did Olivia have left after visiting the supermarket? To find out, we need to subtract the amount she spent ($14) from the total amount of money she had before going to the supermarket ($91): $$ \therefore 91 - 14 = 77 $$ Therefore, Olivia had $77 left after visiting the supermarket.";
"Response: 
Ada $106 in Olivia's wallet before she visited the supermarket and showroom. After visiting both places, $26 was left in her wallet. If she spent $49 at the showroom, how much did she spend at the supermarket?  To find out, we can use the information that there were $26 remaining after the trip to the showroom. So, if she spent $49 at the showroom, then she must have spent less than $49 at the supermarket. In fact, since $26 remained after the showroom visit, she must have spent only $23 at the supermarket. Therefore, Olivia spent $23 at the supermarket.";
"Response: 
Olivia had $54 in her wallet at first and spent $29 after visiting the supermarket. So, she has $25 left ($54 - $29 = $25).";
"Response:  If Olivia spends $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate how much money is left as follows:

$128 - $38 = $90

So there are $90 remaining in Olivia's wallet after she buys something at the supermarket.";
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then there are 14 applications left on his phone. So, the answer is 14.;
Response:  At first, Dave had 20 applications on his phone. Then he deleted 18 of them, leaving him with 5 remaining apps. So initially, Dave had 20 - 18 = 2 applications on his phone.;
Response:  If Dave had initially added 10 applications to his phone and then added 11 new ones, that means he has a total of 21 applications on his phone (10 + 11 = 21). Then, if he deleted some of them, let's say he deleted 3 applications, so now he has 21 - 3 = 18 applications left on his phone. Therefore, the number of applications that Dave deleted is 3.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications initially and added 89 new ones. So, in total, he has 21 + 89 = 106 applications now. Then, after deleting some of them, he is left with 24 applications. Therefore, the number of applications Dave added minus the number he deleted is: 106 - 24 = 82.;
Response:  Firstly, Dave had 15 applications on his phone and added 71 new ones, so he now has 86 applications in total (15 + 71 = 86). Then, after deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, the number of applications that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the initial number of applications (15) and the final number of applications (14), which is 1. Therefore, Dave deleted 1 application from the total of 86 applications.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and 77 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, to find out how many applications Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of remaining applications (5) from the initial number of applications (16): 16 - 5 = 11. Therefore, Dave deleted 11 applications.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So, to find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of remaining files from the initial total number of files. Therefore, the answer is: Number of files deleted = Total number of files - Remaining number of files = 21 - 7 = 14 files.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 15 applications and 24 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, to find out how many applications were deleted besides the remaining files, we need to subtract the number of applications after deletion from the initial number of applications. Therefore, the answer is: Number of applications beside the remaining files = Initial number of applications - Number of applications after deletion = 15 - 21 = -6 applications.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, the number of files remaining in his phone is 15. Therefore, the answer is 15.;
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his phone and then added some more to have 18 left, that means he must have added at least one application. So, the answer is 1.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and applications in his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, resulting in him having 12 applications left. We are also told that after deleting some applications, he was left with 30 remaining files. So, to find out how many applications Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of applications he had left (12) from the initial number of applications he had (59): 59 - 12 = 47 Therefore, Dave deleted 47 applications.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 17 applications and 21 files left. So, to find out how many files Dave deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the total number of files he had initially: Number of files deleted = Total number of files - Number of files after deletion = 24 - 21 = 3 Therefore, Dave deleted 3 files.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files in his phone initially. Then he deleted some of them, so he has 5 files and 12 applications left. To find out how many applications were deleted besides the files, we can subtract the number of remaining applications from the initial total. Therefore, the number of applications beside the files that were deleted is: $ 24 - 12 = 12$ applications. So, there are 12 applications beside the files that were deleted in Dave's phone.;
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files in his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, the number of files remaining in his phone is 24 - 3 = 21 files. Therefore, there are 21 files remaining in Dave's phone besides the two applications.;
Response:  If Nell has 242 cards and gives 136 of them to Jeff, then she must have 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106). So, Nell has 106 cards remaining.;
Response:  We know that Nell initially had 301 cards and gave 301 to Jeff. So, she now has 154 - 301 = -147 cards left. However, since we are asked how many cards Nell originally had, we need to change the sign of the number to positive. Therefore, the answer is +147 cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell has 528 cards initially and gives some to Jeff. After giving some cards to Jeff, Nell now has 252 cards left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of cards given by Nell = Total number of cards left with Nell - Number of cards left with Jeff Now, let's substitute the values in the equation: Number of cards given by Nell = 528 - x Where x is the number of cards given by Nell to Jeff. Since Jeff had only 11 cards initially, we can assume that x is the number of cards given by Nell to Jeff after he already had 11 cards. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as: Number of cards given by Nell = 528 - 11 Substituting the value of x = 11, we get: Number of cards given by Nell = 528 - 11 = 517 Now, we are asked how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. So, we need to find out what value of x represents the number of cards given by Nell to Jeff. In this case, since Nell gave 11 cards to Jeff, we can say that x = 11. Therefore, the answer is: Nell gave 11 cards to Jeff.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 566 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. Now, she has 535 cards left. So, we can calculate the number of cards Jeff received from Nell as follows: Number of cards Jeff received = Total number of cards Nell had - Number of cards Nell has now = 566 - 535 = 31 Therefore, Jeff currently has 31 cards.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs. She gave some of them to Jeff, so now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards: 415 - 149 = 266 So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-dollar bills before giving some to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-dollar bills left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Baseball Cards = 246 + (Number of Kartu Given to Jeff) Ten-Dollar Bills = 214 - (Number of Kartu Given to Jeff) Now, according to the question, Jeff received some kartu from Nell. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of kartu given to Jeff from the total number of ten-dollar bills Nell had initially. So, we can rewrite the second equation as follows: Ten-Dollar Bills = 214 - Number of Kartu Given to Jeff Substituting the value of Number of Kartu Given to Jeff from the first equation into the second equation, we get: Ten-Dollar Bills = 214 - (Number of Kartu Given to Jeff) = 214 - 10 = 204 Now, we know that Nell has 404 baseball cards in total, so we can substitute this value into the first equation: Baseball Cards = 246 + (Number of Kartu Given to Jeff) = 246 + 10 = 256 Therefore, there are 10 more ten-dollar bills than baseball cards Nell has.;
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards initially and gave some to John. After giving some to John, she had 210 cards left. Now we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. The statement says ""beberapa lagi"" which means ""some more"". So, let's assume that Nell gave Jeff x number of cards. Since she had 210 cards left after giving some to John, she must have given Jeff fewer than 210 cards. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is between 0 and 209 (inclusive).  Since there are only positive integers between 0 and 209, the possible values for x are 1, 2,..., 209.  Among these values, the smallest one that satisfies the condition is x = 196, since Nell had 210 cards left after giving 196 cards to Jeff.  Therefore, Nell gave 196 cards to Jeff.";
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of them to Jeff, so she now has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards:  Number of baseball cards = 178 - 55 = 123 So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.;
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-dollar bills initially. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of baseball cards to 376. Now, we need to find out how many more ten-dollar bills Nell has than she had initially. Since she had 38 ten-dollar bills initially, and now she has 111 left, we can say that she gained 73 ten-dollar bills (111 - 38 = 73). So, the difference between the number of ten-dollar bills Nell has now and the number she had initially is 73. Therefore, the answer is 73.;
Response:  At first, Paco had 19 kue and he ate some of them. Then, he had 35 kue left. So, at the beginning, Paco must have eaten x kue where x is the difference between 19 and 35, which is equal to 16 (since 35 - 19 = 16). Therefore, Paco ate 16 kue at the beginning.;
Response:  If Paco has eaten 28 kue and he has 7 left, then he must have eaten some of them. So, let's say he ate x kue. Now we know that 28 - x = 7, which simplifies to x = 21. Therefore, Paco ate 21 kue.;
"Response: 
Paco initially had 40 kue and he ate 2 of them, so now he has 40 - 2 = 38 kue left. Then, he bought 37 more kue, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 kue in total. Therefore, there are 75 - 2 = 73 kue remaining from Paco.";
Response:  Firstly, Paco had 25 kue and he ate 5 of them, so he has 20 kue left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more kue, which means he now has 23 kue in total (20 + 3 = 23). So, the number of kue that Paco ate is 5, and the number of kue he bought is 3, therefore the answer is 8 (5 + 3 = 8).;
"Response: 
Paco initially has 13 kue and eats 2 of them. So he now has 13 - 2 = 11 kue left. Then, he buys 36 more kue. How many kue does he have in total now?  We can calculate this as follows: Total kue = Initial kue + Kue bought = 11 + 36 = 47 kue. Therefore, the answer is 47.";
Response:  Paco has 40 kue to start with and he eats 5 of them. So, now he has 40 - 5 = 35 kue left. Then, he gives 13 kue to his friend. Now, he has 35 - 13 = 22 kue left. Therefore, there are 22 kue left from Paco.;
Response:  Paco has eaten 17 cookies and given 13 to his friend. So he has 17 - 13 = 4 remaining cookies.;
Response:  Paco has eaten 12 kue and given 21 to his friend. So he has 9 kue left (12 - 21 = 9). Therefore, he gave 9 kue to his friend.;
"Response: 
Paco had 22 pieces of sweet cake and 75 pieces of salty cake in total. He ate 15 pieces of sweet cake and 54 pieces of salty cake. To find out how many sweet cakes are left, we need to subtract the number he ate from the initial amount he had. So, the number of sweet cakes left is: 22 - 15 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 pieces of sweet cake left with Paco.";
Response:  Paco has 9 kue manis and 6 kue asin to start with. If he eats 36 kue manis, then he has eaten all of his initial 9 kue manis. So now he only has 6 kue asin left. Therefore, there are 6 kue asin remaining from Paco.;
Response:  If Paco has 37 kue manis and he eats 5 of them, then he has 37 - 5 = 32 left.  If he also eats 2 kue asin, then he has 0 (zero) kue asin left. So, the number of kue manis that Paco has eaten is 32.;
Response:  If Paco has eaten 8 kue manis and 6 kue asin initially, then he has eaten a total of 8 + 6 = 14 kue.  Then, if he has eaten 20 more kue manis, that means he has eaten a total of 14 + 20 = 34 kue manis in all.  As for the kue asin, since he has already eaten 6, and then he has eaten 34 - 6 = 28 additional kue asin, so he has eaten a total of 28 kue asin in all. Therefore, the number of kue asin that Paco has eaten is 28.;
Response:  If Paco has eaten 36 kue and he had 37 kue to start with, then how many kue are left for him now? We can write an equation based on this information: Number of kue left = Total number of kue - Number of kue eaten So, in this case, we have: Number of kue left = 37 - 36 = 1 Now, we know that there is one kue left for Paco after he has eaten 36 kue.;
Response:  Paco has 36 kue in total and he gives away 14 to his friend. So, how many does he have left? 36 - 14 = 22. Therefore, there are 22 kue remaining from Paco.;
Response:  Paco has 41 kue and gives 9 to his friend. So he has 32 kue left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he eats 18 of those remaining kue, leaving him with 0 kue. Therefore, the number of kue that Paco ate from what he gave away is 18.;
Response:  Paco has 6 kue and gives 30 to his friend. So, he has 6 - 30 = -24 left. Then, he eats 23 of them, so he is left with -24 - 23 = -47 kue. Therefore, he gave away 30 - 47 = -17 kue to his friend.;
Response:  Paco had 97 kue asin and 34 kue manis to start with. He ate 15 kue manis, so he has 34 + 15 = 49 kue manis left. Then, he ate 56 kue asin, which means he has 49 - 56 = -7 kue manis left (since you can't eat something that doesn't exist). So, there are no kue manis left for Paco.;
"Response: 
Paco has 26 kue asin and 17 kue manis in total. He eats 14 kue manis and 9 kue asin. So, he leaves behind 26 - 14 = 12 kue asin. Therefore, there are 12 kue asin left from Paco.";
Response:  If Paco has 39 kue manis and he eats 23 of them, then he has 16 kue manis left (39 - 23 = 16).  If he also eats 6 kue asin, then he has 10 kue manis left (16 - 6 = 10). So, Paco has eaten 10 kue manis in total.;
Response:  If Paco has 40 kue manis and 25 kue asin, then he has in total 65 kue (40 + 25).  If he eats 28 kue asin, then he has left with 37 kue (65 - 28).  Finally, if he eats 15 more kue manis, then he has 22 kue left (37 - 15). So, the number of kue asin that Paco makan is 28.;
Response:  If Gwen received $7 and spent some of it, then she has $5 left. To find out how much she spent, we can divide the amount she had after spending ($5) by the amount she had at first ($7): $$ \frac {5}{7} = \boxed {0.71} $$ So, Gwen spent $0.71 or $71 cents.;
Response:  We know that Gwen received $10 for her birthday (Gwen menerima beberapa dolar). Then she spent $8 of it (Gwen menghabiskan 8 dolar). So now she has $2 left ($6 - $8 = $2). Therefore, the amount of money Gwen received for her birthday is $10.;
Response:  Firstly, Gwen received $2 from her mother and then she got additional $4 from her father, so in total she has $6. Now, if she spends $3, she will have $3 left with her which is the correct answer.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. So far, she has received a total of $13 ($8 + $5).  Next, we are told that she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money that Gwen received from her mother is: $13 - $4 = $9.  So, Gwen received $9 from her mother and $5 from her father.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father. So far, she has received a total of $9 ($3 + $6).  Now, let's see how much she spent. According to the question, she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money Gwen received from her father is equal to the amount she did not spend, which is $6 - $4 = $2.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. So, in total, she received $12 ($5 + $7).  Next, we are asked how much money she spent. We know that she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money she received from her mother minus the amount she spent is equal to the total amount she received. So, we can write an equation as follows: $12 - $4 =?. Solving for?, we get $8. Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her $8 more than her father did.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she has a total of $7.  If she spends $6, then she will have $1 left with her. So, the amount of money that Gwen received from her father is $5 - $1 = $4 more than the amount she received from her mother.;
Response:  If Josh has 9 marbles in his collection and he loses some of them, then he has fewer marbles now than he had initially. We can assume that he lost x marbles. So, the number of marbles Josh has now is 9 - x. Since he has 4 marbles now, we can set up an equation as follows: 9 - x = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.;
Response:  If Josh has 30 marbles in his collection and he lost 21 of them, then he has 9 marbles left (30 - 21 = 9). So, now Josh has 9 marbles in his collection.;
Response:  If Josh had 19 balls in his collection and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8).  However, if he found 5 new balls, then he now has 13 balls in total (8 + 5 = 13). So, the number of balls that Josh has now is 13.;
Response:  If Josh has 4 balls in his collection and he lost 16 of them, then he is left with 4 - 16 = -12 balls. However, he found 8 new balls, so the total number of balls he now has is -12 + 8 = 6 balls. Therefore, the answer to the question is 6.;
Response:  If Josh has 7 balls in his collection and he lost 8 balls, then he has 7 - 8 = -1 balls left. But then he found 10 new balls, so now he has 7 + 10 = 17 balls in total. Therefore, the number of balls that Josh found is 17 - 8 = 9 balls.;
Response:  If Josh has 21 pencils in his collection and he found 7 marbles, then he must have had 21 - 7 = 14 pencils before finding the marbles. So, now he has 14 + 7 = 21 pencils in his collection.;
Response:  If Josh has 20 marbles and gives 2 to Jack, then he has 20 - 2 = 18 marbles left. So, Josh has 18 marbles now.;
Response:  We know that Josh had 22 chess pieces in his collection initially. Then, Jack gave him 20 marbles. So, we need to find out how many marbles Josh has now. To do this, we can divide the number of marbles given by Jack (20) by the total number of chess pieces Josh had initially (22): Number of marbles = Number of chess pieces x Marbles per chess piece  Number of marbles = 22 x 1 = 22 marbles Therefore, Josh has 22 marbles now.;
Response:  If Josh had 11 balls and he previously owned 19 kelereng (balls), then we can deduce that he must have lost 8 balls. So, now he has 19 - 8 = 11 balls in his collection.;
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 marbles in his collection. Then he found 13 more marbles while losing 5 marbles. So, now he has 22 + 13 - 5 = 30 marbles left in his collection.;
Response:  If Josh has 15 marbles in his collection and he finds 9 of them, then he now has 6 marbles (15 - 9 = 6). However, he loses 23 marbles, so he ends up with -23 marbles (-23 = -46). Therefore, the number of marbles that Josh lost from what he found is -46.;
Response:  If Josh has 3 keluang in his collection and he loses 5 of them, then he is left with 3 - 5 = 2 keluang. So, he found 2 keluang from what he lost.;
Response:  The total weight of the strawberries that Marco and his father picked is 4 pounds (or 1.8 kg). Since Marco alone picked 19 pounds (or 8.6 kg) of strawberries, we can calculate how much more he picked than his father as follows:  Difference = Weight of Marco's strawberries - Weight of his father's strawberries  = 8.6 kg - 1.8 kg  = 6.8 kg  So, Marco's strawberries are 6.8 kilograms (or 15 lbs) more than his father's.;
Response:  The total weight of the strawberries that Marco and his father picked is 35 pounds (or 35 lb). Since Marco's share of the strawberries weighs 13 pounds (or 13 lb), we can calculate how much more his father's share weighs by subtracting Marco's share from the total weight:  Weight of Marco's share = 13 lb Total weight - Weight of Marco's share = 35 lb - 13 lb = 22 lb Therefore, the difference in weight between Marco's father's share and Marco's share is 22 pounds (or 22 lb).;
Response:  Ayahnya pergi mempetik stroberi dengan Marco. Together they picked 20 pounds of strawberries. The weight of his father's strawberries is 17 pounds. Therefore, the weight of Marco's strawberries is:  Weight of Marco's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries - Weight of his father's strawberries Total weight of strawberries = 20 pounds - 17 pounds = 3 pounds So, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 3 pounds.;
Response:  The weight of Marco's strawberries is 8 pounds (pon), and his father's strawberries are 32 pounds (pon). So, together they have 8 + 32 = 40 pounds (pon) of strawberries.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries, then Marco had 3 pounds left after he lost 9 pounds during the journey back home. So, Ayahnya must have had 21 pounds (24 - 9 = 21) of strawberries.;
Response:  Ayah Marco and his son went to pick strawberries together and collected 36 pounds of them in total. During their journey back home, Ayah Marco lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So, now the weight of the strawberries that Ayah Marco has is 12 pounds (36 - 8 = 12). Therefore, the weight of the strawberries that Ayah Marco originally had was 48 pounds (36 + 8 = 48).;
Response:  Ayah Marco and his son went to pick strawberries together, collecting 22 pounds of strawberries in total. On their way back home, Marco's father found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. So, now Marco's strawberries weigh 36 pounds in total. To find out how much weight Ayah Marco gained, we need to subtract the original amount from the new total weight: 36 - 22 = 14 pounds. Therefore, Ayah Marco gained 14 pounds of strawberries during their trip.;
Response:  If Marco and his father together have 37 pounds of strawberries, and Marco alone has 15 pounds, then we can calculate how much weight his father had as follows:  Weight of Marco = 15 pounds (given)  Weight of father = Total weight - Weight of Marco = 37 pounds - 15 pounds = 22 pounds (or 9.8 kg);
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together have a total of 47 pounds (or 20 kg) of strawberries. Since Marco has 30 pounds (or 13.6 kg) of strawberries alone, we can calculate how much more weight he has than his father as follows:  Weight of Marco = 30 pounds  Weight of father + Weight of Marco = 47 pounds ----------------------------  Subtracting the weight of Marco from the total weight gives us the weight of his father:  Weight of father = 47 pounds - 30 pounds = 17 pounds  Therefore, Marco's strawberries are 17 pounds heavier than his father's.;
Response:  The total weight of the strawberries that Marco and his father picked is 26 pounds (or 11 kg). Since Marco alone has 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg) of strawberries, we can calculate how much more his father has by subtracting the amount he has from the total weight they collected:  Weight of Marco's strawberries = 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg)  Total weight of strawberries = 26 pounds (or 11 kg)  Difference in weight between Marco and his father = Total weight of strawberries - Weight of Marco's strawberries = 26 pounds (or 11 kg) - 10 pounds (or 4.5 kg) = 16 pounds (or 7 kg)  Therefore, Marco's father has 16 pounds (or 7 kg) more strawberries than Marco.;
Response:  Ayah Marco and his father went to pick strawberries together. The weight of the strawberries that Marco's father picked was 11 pounds (pon). If they were together, the total weight of their strawberries would be 30 pounds (pon). So, the weight of Marco's strawberries is:  Weight of Marco's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries - Weight of strawberries picked by his father Weight of Marco's strawberries = 30 pon - 11 pon = 19 pon Therefore, the weight of Marco's strawberries is 19 pounds (pon).;
Response:  Before stopping at the bus stop, there were 2 children (Dua) who boarded the bus. After they got off, 5 other children boarded the bus (total = 7). Now, there are 10 children in the bus. So, the difference between the number of children before and after is 3 (10 - 7). Therefore, the correct answer is 3.;
Response:  Anak naik bus = 26 + 38 = 64 anak. So, there are 64 anak in the bus now.;
Response:  Anak A and B boarded the bus at stop 1. There were initially 2 anak on the bus. Then, another 3 anak (Anak C, D, and E) boarded the bus at stop 2. So, there are now 5 anak on the bus. After that, 40 more anak (including Anak F through G) boarded the bus until it reached its final destination. Therefore, the total number of anak who boarded the bus before it stopped is 5 + 40 = 45 anak.;
Response:  We know that there are 43 children in the bus initially. Then, some of them get off at the bus stop, leaving 21 children remaining in the bus. So, we need to find out how many children got off at the bus stop. To do this, we can divide the number of children remaining in the bus (21) by the total number of children in the bus (43), which gives us a proportion of 0.5 or  half. Therefore, half of the original 43 children got off at the bus stop, which is equal to 21 children.;
Response:  At first, there were 41 children who boarded the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop, leaving 18 children behind in the bus. So, how many children were there initially in the bus before they got off? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the total initial number of children. Therefore, the answer is:  Initially, 41 - 18 = 23 children were in the bus before they got off.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 children who boarded the bus at the stop. Then, 10 of them got off the bus while some others boarded it. So, the number of children left in the bus is 21 - 10 = 11. Finally, 16 children were already inside the bus when it arrived at the stop, so the total number of children in the bus now is 11 + 16 = 27. Therefore, there are 27 children in the bus afterward.;
Response:  Anak naik bus = 5  Anak turun dari bus = 6 - 5 = 1  So there are 1 more child who got off the bus than got on it. Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus is 5 + 1 = 6.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 36 children who boarded the bus at the stop. Then, some of them got off the bus while others got on. We don't know exactly how many got off and how many got on, but let's assume it's equal. So, the number of children who got off the bus is also 36. Now, we have 12 children left in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 36 - 12 = 24.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 children who boarded the bus at the initial stage. Then, some of them got off the bus while others joined it. We don't know exactly how many children got off the bus, but let's assume it is x. Therefore, the total number of children on the bus after some got off is 22 + x. Now, we know that 2 children were left on the bus when it arrived at the halt. So, the number of children who got off the bus at the halt is equal to the number of children remaining on the bus, which is 2. Hence, the number of children who got off the bus at the halt is 2.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 28 children who boarded the bus initially. Then, some of them got off the bus (but how many?). So, the number of children left in the bus is 28 - x, where x is the number of children who got off the bus. Now, another 10 children boarded the bus while some others got off (how many?), so the total number of children in the bus now is 28 - x + 10 - y, where y is the number of children who got off the bus after boarding it. Therefore, the final answer is: 28 - x + 10 - y = 30. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 4 and y = 6. So, there were 4 children who got off the bus after boarding it, and 6 children who got off the bus originally.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that 23 children got off the bus at the stop. Then, some of them got back onto the bus while 8 children remained in it. So, the total number of children who were left in the bus afterward is 8. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who remained in the bus is equal to 23 - 8 = 15.;
Response:  If the rotisserie maker made 133 kue and sold 51 of them, then we know that he has 82 remaining (133 - 51 = 82). Now, let's assume that the baker bought all of these 82 kue from the rotisserie maker. So, the number of kue that the baker bought is equal to the number of kue that the rotisserie maker had left after selling 51, which is 82. Therefore, the baker bought 82 kue.;
Response:  If Tukang Roti makes 54 kue and sells some of them, then he has X kue left after selling. Since he sold some kue, we know that X is less than or equal to 54. Now, let's find out how many kue Baker sold. We are given that Baker sold some kue, so we can write an equation based on this information: Total number of kue sold = Number of kue sold by Baker + Number of kue left by Tukang Roti After solving for the total number of kue sold, we get: Total number of kue sold = (Number of kue sold by Baker) + (X - Number of kue sold by Baker) Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total number of kue sold = (Number of kue sold by Baker) + (13 - Number of kue sold by Baker) Solving for Number of kue sold by Baker, we get: Number of kue sold by Baker = Total number of kue sold - 13 So, Baker sold 13 kue. Therefore, there were 13 kue left by Tukang Roti after he sold some of them.;
Response:  We know that Tukang Roti has sold 145 of his total number of kue. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of kue sold = Total number of kue x Percentage of kue sold  In this case, we are given that Tukang Roti made 300 kue in total and he sold 145 of them. Therefore, we can calculate the percentage of kue sold as follows: Percentage of kue sold = (Number of kue sold / Total number of kue) x 100  Substituting the values we have obtained so far into the formula above, we get: Percentage of kue sold = (145 / 300) x 100  Simplifying and calculating the value, we get: Percentage of kue sold = 48%  Now, we want to find out how many kue were left unsold after Tukang Roti sold 145 of them. To do this, we need to subtract the number of kue sold from the total number of kue made by Tukang Roti: Total number of kue left unsold = Total number of kue - Number of kue sold  Using the values we have obtained earlier, we can substitute the following formulas: Total number of kue left unsold = 300 - 145  Simplifying and calculating the value, we get: Total number of kue left unsold = 155  Therefore, there were 155 kue left unsold after Tukang Roti sold 145 of them.;
Response:  Tukang Roti has made 155 kue and sold them to his friend for Rp 140. So, the amount of money that Tukang Roti earned from selling those kue is:  Total Amount = Number of Kue Sold x Price per Kue  Total Amount = 155 x Rp 140  Total Amount = Rp 21,700 ( rounded off to nearest integer) Therefore, there are Rp 21,700 worth of kue left unsold with Baker.;
Response:  The total number of kue that tukang roti had was 121. He sold 105 of them and bought 170 new ones. So, the difference between the number of kue he had and the number he sold is: 121 - 105 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 kue left in the baker's inventory.;
Response:  The total number of kue that Tukang Roti had was 13 (given).  He sold 91 kue (given). So, the difference between the number of kue he had and the number he sold is:  13 - 91 = -78. Therefore, Baker bought 78 kue from Tukang Roti.;
Response:  The total number of kue that the baker made is given as 170. He sold 78 of them and bought 31 new ones. So, the difference between the number of kue he sold and the number he bought is:  170 - 78 = 92  Therefore, the baker sold 92 more kue than he bought.;
Response:  Tukang roti first made 110 kue and sold 75 of them. So, there are 35 kue left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 kue. So, now there are 35 + 76 = 111 kue in total. Therefore, there are still 111 kue at the baker.;
Response:  The total number of kue made by the baker is given as 144. Of these, he sold 71 kue, leaving him with 73 un Sold kue. Then, he made another 111 kue, bringing his total to 184 kue. So, the number of kue that the baker sold is 71 + 111 = 182 kue.;
Response:  If Penjual makes 149 kue and sells 10 of them, then there are 139 kue left (149 - 10 = 139).  If he also sells 90 more kue, then there are 49 kue left (139 - 90 = 49). So, there are 49 kue still available at the baker.;
Response:  If the baker makes 7 kue and sells 15 of them, then he has 7 - 15 = 9 kue left to sell. Similarly, if he sells 103 kue and originally had 148 kue, then he has 103 - 148 = 55 kue left after selling all the kue. So there are 55 kue left from the baker.;
Response:  Tukang Roti made 126 kue and sold 115 of them. So he has 11 kue left over (126 - 115 = 11). Now, let's look at how many kue Baker made and sold. Baker made 48 kue and sold 81 of them. So they have 33 kue left over (48 - 81 = -33). To find out how many more kue Baker made than Tukang Roti, we subtract the number of kue that Baker has left over from the number of kue that Tukang Roti has left over: (-33) - 11 = -44. Therefore, Baker made 44 more kue than Tukang Roti.;
Response:  If penjual (seller) sells 70 kue and 88 kue, then the total number of kue sold is 70 + 88 = 158 kue. Now, we need to find out how many more kue were sold than those made by the rotisserie. To do this, we subtract the number of kue made by the rotisserie from the total number of kue sold: 158 - 19 = 139 kue. Therefore, there are 139 more kue sold than those made by the rotisserie.;
Response:  If Penjual has sold 157 kue and 169 kue, then he has made a total of 326 kue (157 + 169). Now, if Baker has sold 158 kue and 147 kue, then he has also made a total of 305 kue (158 + 147). So, to find out how many more kue Baker has sold than Penjual, we need to subtract the number of kue sold by Baker from the total number of kue sold by Penjual: 305 - 326 = -21. Therefore, Baker has sold 21 fewer kue than Penjual.;
Response:  Tukang Roti made 54 kue and sold 68 kue. So, he still has 54 - 68 = 9 kue left. Now, let's check how many kue Baker sold. He sold 92 kue. So, we need to find out how many more kue Baker sold than what Tukang Roti had left. We can do this by subtracting the number of kue sold by Baker from the number of kue that Tukang Roti had left: 9 (left by Tukang Roti) - 92 = -83. Therefore, there are 83 more kue sold by Baker than what Tukang Roti had left.;
Response:  If the baker sells 44 kue and initially makes 48 kue, then there are 4 (48 - 44) kue left over from the baker. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  If the baker sells 8 kue and makes 40 kue at first, then he has 32 extra kue (40 - 8 = 32). So, the number of kue that the baker sold is 8 + 32 = 40.;
"Response:  If the baker bought 137 kue from Darinya and made 169 kue initially, then we can calculate the number of kue that the baker still has as follows:

Number of kue still with the baker = Initial quantity of kue - Number of kue purchased from Darinya
= 169 - 137
= 32

Therefore, the baker still has 32 kue.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that tukang roti has made 173 kue and bought 103 new ones. So, there are 70 kue left with him (173 - 103 = 70). Then, he sold 86 kue, which means that now there are only 44 kue left with him (70 - 86 = 44). Therefore, the number of kue still available at the baker is 44.;
Response:  Tukang Roti made 99 kue and bought 167 new ones. So, he has 68 excess kue (167 - 99 = 68). Then, he sold 89 kue. Therefore, the number of kue that Baker bought from him is equal to the number of kue he had left after selling, which is 68. Thus, Baker bought 68 kue from Tukang Roti.;
Response:  The number of kue that the baker made is given as 8.  Then, he bought new kue and sold them. So, the total number of kue he had was 8 + (139 - 145) = 8 + (-6) = 2. Therefore, the baker sold 2 more kue than he bought.;
Response:  Tukang roti first made 62 kue and then he made additional 149 kue. So, in total, he made 211 kue (62 + 149). Then, he sold 144 of them. Therefore, there are 67 kue left with the baker (211 - 144 = 67).;
Response:  The total number of kue made by Baker is given as 81 + 92 = 173.  Then, he sold 46 of them. So, the remaining kue that Baker did not sell is 173 - 46 = 127.;
Response:  Tukang roti has made 61 kue and sold 108 kue, so there are now 39 kue left (61 - 108 = 39). Then, he also has 44 kue remaining after selling those (44 + 39 = 83), which means that there are now 83 kue available at the baker.;
Response:  If Tukang Roti made 56 kue and sold 104 kue, then he has left with 56 - 104 = -48 kue.  Similarly, if he made 124 kue and sold 29 kue, then he has left with 124 - 29 = 95 kue. So, Baker still has 95 kue.;
Response:  Tukang roti membuat 52 kue and 84 kue, so he has made in total 52 + 84 = 136 kue. If he sells 102 kue and 94 kue, then the number of kue sold is greater than the number of kue made by tukang roti. Therefore, the answer is 136 - 52 - 84 = 78 more kue were sold than those made by tukang roti.;
Response:  If penjual (seller) sold 140 kue and 92 kue, then the total number of kue sold is 140 + 92 = 232 kue. Now, we need to find out how many more kue were sold than those made by the roti maker. To do this, we subtract the number of kue made by the roti maker from the total number of kue sold: 232 - 134 = 98 kue. Therefore, there are 98 more kue sold than those made by the roti maker.;
Response:  If Penjual has made 14 kue and sold 8 of them, then he still has 6 kue left (14 - 8 = 6).  If Baker has made 153 kue and sold 97 of them, then she still has 56 kue left (153 - 97 = 56).  To find out how many more kue Baker has than Penjual, we can subtract the number of kue that Penjual has from the number of kue that Baker has: 56 - 6 = 50. So, Baker has 50 more kue than Penjual.;
Response:  If Penjual sold 154 kue and 78 kue, then the total number of kue sold is 154 + 78 = 232 kue. Now, we need to find out how many more kue Penjual sold than Baker. To do this, we can subtract the number of kue sold by Baker from the total number of kue sold by Penjual:  Number of kue sold by Penjual - Number of kue sold by Baker = 232 - x =  Where x is the number of kue sold by Baker. Since Baker sold 43 kue and 114 kue, the total number of kue sold by Baker is 43 + 114 = 157 kue. Therefore, the difference between the number of kue sold by Penjual and Baker is: 232 - 157 = 75 kue. So, Penjual sold 75 more kue than Baker.;
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games for Nintendo and she needs to have 140 games left, then we can calculate it as follows:

Number of games needed = Total number of games - Number of games already owned
= 140 - 22
= 118

Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 more games for Nintendo in order to have 140 games left.";
Response:  If Kelly has played 106 games of Nintendo and she gives away 64 matches, then we need to find out how many games are left for her.  To do this, we can divide the number of games she still has (106) by the number of games she gave away (64). So, the remaining number of games is:  106 / 64 = 1.67 games. Therefore, there are approximately 1.67 games left for Kelly if she gives away 64 matches.;
Response:  If Kelly had 91 games of Nintendo at first and then she got 92 more, that means she has a total of 91 + 92 = 183 games now. So, initially, Kelly had 91 games.;
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 games from Nintendo and 70 games from Sony. To have 12 games left from Nintendo, we need to find out how many games Kelly needs to give away from her Nintendo collection.  Since she has 20 games from Nintendo, and she wants to have 12 games left, we can subtract 20 from 12 to get the number of games Kelly needs to give away:  Number of games Kelly needs to give away = 12 - 20 = -8 games. So, Kelly needs to give away 8 games from her Nintendo collection in order to have 12 games left.;
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and wants to have 31 Sony games left after giving some away. So we can start with the total number of games Kelly has: 46 + 132 = 178 games. Now, let's find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give away in order to have 31 Sony games left: 178 - 31 = 147 games. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 147 Sony games in order to have 31 Sony games left.;
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games of Nintendo and she found 31 more, then she now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. To have 6 remaining games, Kelly must give away at least 111 - 6 = 105 games. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 105 games to have 6 remaining games.;
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks to build his tower and he uses 38 of them, then he must have had 14 blocks left at first (52 - 38 = 14).;
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left after building the tower, then we can find out how many blocks Randy used for the tower by dividing the number of remaining blocks (72) by the total number of blocks (97). So, the answer is:  Number of blocks used by Randy = Remaining blocks / Total blocks = 72/97 = 3/5 or 60%.;
Response:  We know that Randy has used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, we have a total of 25 blocks used (14 + 11 = 25). Now, we need to find out how many blocks are left. To do this, we can subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks available (79 - 25 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 blocks left.;
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he used 27 of them to build the tower. So, the number of blocks left is 58 - 27 = 31. Now we are asked how many blocks Randy used to build the tower and the house together. Since the house requires 53 blocks, we can say that Randy used 53 + 27 = 80 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house. Therefore, the answer is 80.;
"Response:  We know that Randy has 37 blocks in total and he used 33 blocks to build the tower. So, we have:
Blocks for tower = 33
Now, we are asked how many blocks Randy used to build the tower compared to the number of blocks he used to build the house. The question states that Randy used 13 blocks to build the house. Therefore, we can compare the number of blocks used for the tower with the number of blocks used for the house as follows:
Number of blocks used for tower / Number of blocks used for house =?
We want to find out how much more blocks Randy used to build the tower than the number of blocks he used to build the house. To do this, we divide the number of blocks used for the tower by the number of blocks used for the house:
(33) / (13) =?
Simplifying the fraction, we get:
33 / 13 = 2
So, Randy used twice as many blocks to build the tower as he did to build the house.";
Response:  If Randy used 79 blocks to build a tower and he has 86 total blocks, then he must have used all of his remaining blocks (84 - 79 = 8) for building the house. So, he used 8 blocks to build the house.;
Response:  We know that Randy has used 36 blocks to build the tower. So, we have 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left. Therefore, there are 23 blocks remaining.;
Response:  If Randy used 20 blocks to build a house and he built 3 houses using all of his 95 blocks, then he must have used 60 blocks (20 x 3) for building houses. Now, if he used 50 blocks to build a tower, then he has 45 blocks left (95 - 50 = 45). So, Randy used 45 blocks to build the tower.;
Response:  If Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and he has 90 blocks in total, then he must have had 1 block left over after building the house. So, the number of blocks he used for the house is 89. Now, let's find out how many blocks he used for the tower. He used 63 blocks to build the tower, which means that he had 27 blocks left over after building the tower (since he started with 90 blocks). Therefore, the number of blocks he used for the house is equal to the number of blocks he had left over after building the tower, which is 27. So, the answer is 27.;
Response:  If Ada has read 20 different books in her crazy school series, and she hasn't read any of the other 5 books yet, then we can conclude that Ada has read a total of 20 + 5 = 25 books from the series.;
Response:  If you have read 13 books and there are 21 books in total in the series, then the number of unread books is:  21 - 13 = 8   So, there are 8 unread books left in the series.;
Response:  If Ada has read 22 different books and watched 10 different movies in her crazy school series, that means she has read or watched a total of 32 items (books + movies).  If you have read 12 books, then you still need to read 20 more books (32 - 12 = 20).  Similarly, if you have watched 56 movies, then you still need to watch 44 more movies (56 - 10 = 44). Therefore, the number of books and movies that you should read/watch is 20 and 44 respectively.;
Response:  If you have read 19 books and watched 7 films, then you have a total of 26 items in your collection (19 books + 7 films). Now, let's assume that each book takes an average of 5 hours to read and each film takes an average of 2 hours to watch. Therefore, the total time taken to complete all 26 items in your collection is:  Time = Number of items x Average reading/watching time per item  Time = 26 x 5/1 = 130 hours  So, if you have read 19 books and watched 7 films, it means you have spent approximately 130 hours enjoying your collection of literature and cinema.;
Response:  If Ada read 16 books and watched 14 films in the Konyol Gila series, then we know that there are more books than films in the series.  To find out how many more books there are, we can subtract the number of films from the total number of books:  Books = 16 - 14 = 2  So, there are two more books than films in the Konyol Gila series.;
Response:  If Ada reads 8 books and watches 10 films in the Konyol Gila series, then she has consumed a total of 8 + 10 = 18 pieces of media from that series.  Now, if she reads 19 more books, she will have consumed a total of 18 + 19 = 37 pieces of media from the Konyol Gila series.  Therefore, there are 37 - 10 = 27 more films than books in the Konyol Gila series.;
Response:  If Ada reads 10 books and watches 11 films in school, that means she has read 10 x 1 = 10 books and watched 11 x 1 = 11 films.  If she then reads 13 more books, it means she has read 13 + 10 = 23 books in total. Similarly, if she watches 12 more films, it means she has watched 11 + 12 = 23 films in total. Therefore, Ada has read 23 books and watched 23 films.;
Response:  If Ada reads 11 books and watches 17 films in the crazy school series, that means she has read/watched a total of 11 + 17 = 28 items from the series.  If you read 7 books and watched 21 films, you have consumed 7 + 21 = 28 items from the series as well. So, the answer is 28.;
"Response:  We know that Anda has already read 8 books from the ""Gila Konyol"" series. If there are a total of 14 different books in the series, then we can calculate the number of books left to be read as follows: Number of books left to be read = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 - 8 = 6 So, Anda still needs to read 6 more books from the ""Gila Konyol"" series.";
Response:  If there are 62 films and 19 books in the crazy school series, that means there are 62 x 19 = 1258 items in total.  If you have read 4 books, then you have not read 1258 - 4 = 1254 items.  Therefore, you still need to read 1254 books.;
Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies in the crazy school series, that means you still need to watch 21 - 7 = 14 more movies.;
"Response:  If we read 11 books and watched 40 films in the ""Konyol Gila"" series, then we have a total of 51 items (11 books + 40 films). Now, let's assume that each book is equivalent to 2 films (this is just an assumption, as the number of films per book can vary greatly depending on the length and complexity of the story). Therefore, if we convert the 11 books into films, we get: 11 x 2 = 22 films. So, there are more books than films in the ""Konyol Gila"" series. The difference between the number of books and films is: 51 - 22 = 29. Hence, for every 3 books, there is approximately 1 film more in the series.";
Response:  If we read 13 books and watch 63 films in the crazy school series, that means we have watched 63 - 13 = 50 more films than books. So, there are 50 more films than books in the series.;
Response:  If you read 14 films and watched 19 books, that means you have seen a total of 33 media (14 films + 19 books). Now, let's calculate how many different media you have consumed:  Books: You have watched 19 books, which means you have consumed 19 different books. Films: You have watched 14 films, which means you have consumed 14 different films. In conclusion, you have consumed a total of 19 + 14 = 33 different media.;
Response:  If you read 19 books and watched 16 movies, that means you have seen a total of 35 pieces of media (19 books + 16 movies). So, if you want to know how many films you have read, we can subtract the number of films you have watched from the total number of media you have consumed: 35 - 16 = 19. Therefore, you have read 19 films.;
Response:  We know that Dave has won 7 tickets in total and he used some of them to buy toys. So, we can assume that he has 7 - x tickets left, where x is the number of tickets he used to buy toys. Now, we are asked how many tickets Dave used to buy toys. Since each ticket costs $1, if Dave used x tickets to buy toys, then he spent $x dollars on toys. Therefore, the remaining tickets Dave has = 7 - x.;
Response:  We know that Dave has won some tickets and used them to buy some stuff at the arcade.  If he still has 14 tickets left after using 12 of them, then we can conclude that he must have won 14 - 12 = 2 more tickets than he initially had. So, Dave has won 2 + 12 = 14 tickets in total.;
Response:  If Dave has won 18 tickets and he uses 5 of them to buy some games, then he has 13 tickets left (18 - 5 = 13).  And if he uses 11 more tickets to buy some clothes, then he has 2 tickets left (13 - 11 = 2). So, the answer is 2 tickets are left after Dave buys some games and clothes using his winnings.;
Response:  If Dave has won 19 tickets and he uses 12 of them to buy some toys, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 remaining tickets.  Now, if he spends 7 more tickets to buy some clothes, that means he has used up all his remaining tickets (7). So, the number of tickets Dave used to buy clothes is equal to the total number of tickets he had initially, which is 19. Therefore, the answer is 19.;
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and he uses 8 of them to buy some toys, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5).  Now, if he wants to buy some clothes with his remaining tickets, he will use all 5 tickets for that purpose (5 = 0). So, in total, Dave used 8 + 5 = 13 tickets to buy both toys and clothes.;
Response:  We know that Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 remaining tickets. If he uses 10 of these tickets to buy some toys, then how many tickets are left? So, the answer is 12.;
Response:  We know that Haley planted 14 trees behind her house. After the storm (which killed 9 trees), how many trees did Haley lose? So, we need to find out the difference between the number of trees she had and the number of trees she lost. The difference is equal to the number of trees that survived the storm. Therefore, the answer is: Surviving trees = Number of trees she had - Number of trees she lost = 14 - 9 = 5 trees.;
Response:  We know that Haley planted 13 trees behind her house. After the storm, 6 of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees survived the storm.;
Response:  We know that initially, Haley had planted 20 trees behind her house. After the storm, 4 of them were left standing. So, the number of trees that died in the storm is equal to the initial number minus the number that survived. Therefore, the answer is:  $latex \boxed{16}$;
Response:  If Haley planted 3 trees behind her house and after the storm (badai) that killed 5 trees, there are only 8 trees left. So, if we assume that all the remaining 8 trees produce fruits equally, then in total, Haley will have 8 x 5 = 40 fruits. Therefore, the answer is 40.;
Response:  At first, Haley had 9 trees in her backyard. After the storm killed 4 of them, she planted 5 new ones. So, now Haley has 9 + 5 = 14 trees in total.;
Response:  At first, there were 12 trees planted in the backyard of Haley's house. After two trees died due to the storm, there were 10 trees left. So, the number of trees remaining is 10.;
Response:  If there were initially 3 trees planted at the back of Haley's house and after the storm, 13 trees died, then we can calculate the number of trees that survived as follows: Number of surviving trees = Initial number of trees x (1 - Death rate) Number of deaths = Total number of trees x Death rate Where Death rate is the percentage of trees that died due to the storm. So in this case, if 13 out of 3 = 4 trees died, then the number of surviving trees would be: Number of surviving trees = 3 x (1 - 0.4) = 2 trees Therefore, there are 2 trees that survived the storm.;
Response:  At first, Hayley planted 11 trees behind her house. After two storms hit and killed two of those trees, how many trees remained standing? So, there were 9 trees remaining after the second storm.;
"Response:  If they are harvesting 66 karung of oranges per day and each karung contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges they are harvesting per day as follows:

66 karung/day x 28 oranges/karung = 1740 oranges/day";
Response:  If they harvest 8 karung (or bag) of citrus fruits per day, then it will take them how many days to harvest 24 baskets of citrus fruits?  We can set up an equation based on this information:  Number of days = Total amount of citrus fruits / Amount harvested per day  In this case, the total amount of citrus fruits is 24 baskets, and the amount harvested per day is 8 karung. So we can plug these values into our equation:  Number of days = 24 / 8  Number of days = 3 Therefore, it will take them 3 days to harvest 24 baskets of citrus fruits.;
Response:  If they harvest for 4 days, then the number of baskets collected per day is:  Total number of baskets / Number of days = x/4 Where x is the total number of baskets collected. Since there are 56 baskets in total, we can set up an equation as follows: x/4 = 56 Now, let's solve for x: x = 56 x 4 = 224 So, they collect 224 baskets per day.;
Response:  If they are harvesting 38 kantongs per day and each kantong contains 42 jeruks, then in one day, they will have collected 38 x 42 = 1656 jeruks. Now, if they continue to do this for 49 days, they will have collected a total of 1656 x 49 = 80736 jeruks. Therefore, the number of kantons of jeruk that they will have after 49 days is 80736 / 38 = approximately 217 kantons.;
Response:  If they harvest 66 kantongs per day and each kantong contains 25 jeruk, then the total number of jeruk collected in one day is:  66 kantongs x 25 jeruk/kantong = 1650 jeruk/day  Now, if they continue to collect jeruk for 87 days, the total number of jeruk collected will be:  1650 jeruk/day x 87 days = 143,500 jeruk  Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have approximately 143,500 jeruk.;
Response:  If they are harvesting 8 karung per day and each karung contains 35 jeruk, then the total number of jeruk harvested per day is:  Total number of jeruk = Number of karung x Number of jeruk in each karung  Total number of jeruk = 8 x 35  Total number of jeruk = 280 jeruk per day;
Response:  If they are harvesting 16 kantongs per day and each kantong contains 57 jeruks, then the total number of jeruks harvested per day is:  16 kantongs/day x 57 jeruks/kantong = 902 jeruks/day Now, to find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 kantongs of jeruks, we can divide the total number of jeruks needed (80 kantongs x 57 jeruks/kantong) by the number of jeruks harvested per day:  80 kantongs x 57 jeruks/kantong = 4,560 jeruks Total number of days required to harvest 80 kantongs of jeruks = 4,560 jeruks / 902 jeruks/day = 5 days Therefore, it will take approximately 5 days for them to harvest 80 kantongs of jeruks.;
Response:  If they harvest 67 kantongs per day and each kantong contains 12 jeruk, then the total number of jeruk harvested daily is 67 x 12 = 804 jeruk per day. Now, if they harvest a total of 35 kantons of jeruk, then the total number of jeruk harvested is 35 x 804 = 28,296 jeruk. Therefore, there are 28,296 jeruk that were harvested in total.;
Response:  If they harvest 74 kantongs per day and throw away 71 of them, then they will have 3 kantongs left after one day (74 - 71 = 3).  Therefore, after 51 days, they will have 3 x 51 = 153 kantongs in total.;
Response:  If they are collecting 76 kantongs per day and throwing away 64 of them, then the number of jeruk collected is equal to the number of kantongs that are not thrown away. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of jeruk = Number of kantongs - Number of kantongs thrown away  In this case, the number of kantongs thrown away is 64, so we can substitute it into the equation as follows: Number of jeruk = 76 - 64  Number of jeruk = 12  Therefore, they are collecting 12 jeruk per day.;
"Response:  If they harvest 28 kantongs of mature durians and 52 kantongs of immature durians per day, then after 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of:

Mature durians = 28 x 26 = 704 kantongs
Immature durians = 52 x 26 = 1328 kantongs
In total, they will have collected 2032 kantongs of durians after 26 days of harvesting.";
"Response:  If they harvest 82 kantongs of ripe tomatoes and 61 kantongs of immature tomatoes per day, then after 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected __________ kantongs of ripe tomatoes.  Solution: We know that the total number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested in 25 days is equal to the sum of the number of kantongs harvested each day for 25 days. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested = Total number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested in 25 days  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested = 82 + (61 x 24)  Where 24 is the number of days left after 25 days of harvesting.  Solving for the value of ""Number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested"", we get: Number of kantongs of tomatoes harvested = 82 + (61 x 24) = 82 + 1440 = 1522 kantongs  Therefore, after 25 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1522 kantongs of ripe tomatoes.";
Response:  If they harvest 31 kantongs of ripe tomatoes and 24 kantongs of immature tomatoes per day, then after 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected __________ kantongs of ripe tomatoes and __________ kantongs of immature tomatoes in total.;
Response:  If there are 44 kantongs of mature durians and 25 kantongs of immature durians per day, then we can write an equation as follows:  Mature durians = Immature durians x (Number of days)  In this case, if we assume that the number of days is equal to 1, then we have:  Mature durians = Immature durians x 1 44 = 25 x 1  So, there are 44 more kantons of mature durians than immature ones per day.;
Response:  If there are 5 kantongs of ripe tomatoes harvested per day and 74 kantongs of immature tomatoes harvested per day, then the total number of tomatoes harvested per day is 5 + 74 = 89 tomatoes per day. Since the number of ripe tomatoes harvested per day is 5/89 = 0.06 or 6% of the total number of tomatoes harvested per day, we can conclude that there are 89 - 6 = 83 immature tomatoes harvested per day. Therefore, the number of immature tomatoes that have not yet ripened from the total number of tomatoes harvested per day is 83/89 = 0.96 or 96%.;
"Response:  If they take 54 days to harvest 54 cantons of oranges, and they harvest 18 cantons per day, then we can calculate how many days it takes them to harvest all 54 cantons as follows:

Days taken = Total number of cantons / Number of cantons harvested per day
= 54 / 18
= 3

Therefore, it will take them 3 days to harvest all 54 cantons of oranges if they harvest 18 cantons per day.";
"Response:  If they harvested 56 kantongs of oranges in total and they worked for 14 days, then we can calculate how many kantongs they harvested per day as follows:

Total number of kantongs = 56
Number of days = 14

So, the number of kantongs they harvested per day is:

Total number of kantongs / Number of days = 56 / 14 = 4

Therefore, they harvested 4 kantongs of oranges per day.";
Response:  If they are harvesting 25 kantongs of fresh lemons and 5 kantongs of ripe lemons per day, then after 73 days of harvesting, the total number of kantongs of ripe lemons will be:  Fresh lemons x Days = Total fresh lemons  Ripe lemons x Days = Total ripe lemons  Substituting the values given in the question:  Fresh lemons = 25 Kantongs/day x 73 Days = 1825 Kantongs  Ripe lemons = 5 Kantongs/day x 73 Days = 365 Kantongs  Therefore, after 73 days of harvesting, the total number of kantongs of ripe lemons will be 1825 + 365 = 2190 kantongs.;
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, they will have collected 6 x 7 = 42 kantongs of fresh lemons and 46 x 6 = 284 kantongs of ripe lemons. So, the total number of lemons that are not yet ripe is 42 + 284 = 326 kantongs.;
Response:  We know that there are 41 kantongs of freshly picked lemons and 86 kantongs of fully grown lemons per day. So we can write an equation as follows: Fresh Lemons = 41 Kantongs/Day Fully Grown Lemons = 86 Kantongs/Day Now, let's solve for the number of fully grown lemons per day: Number of Fully Grown Lemons/Day = Total Number of Lemons/Number of Fresh Lemons Per Day x Number of Days Since we know that there are 30 days in total, we can plug this value into our equation to find the number of fully grown lemons per day: Number of Fully Grown Lemons/Day = 41 Kantongs/Day x 30 Days = 1230 Kantongs/Day Therefore, there are more than 1230 fully grown lemons per day.;
Response:  If they harvested 71 kantongs of fresh lemons and 60 kantongs of ripe lemons per day, then the total number of lemons harvested per day is:  Fresh lemons = 71 x 2 = 142 lemons Ripe lemons = 60 x 2 = 120 lemons Total number of lemons harvested per day = 142 + 120 = 262 lemons Now, we need to find out how many unripened lemons are left from the total number of ripe lemons harvested per day. So, let's subtract the number of ripe lemons harvested per day from the total number of ripe lemons: Unripened lemons = Total number of ripe lemons - Number of ripe lemons harvested per day = 120 - 60 = 60 unripened lemons Therefore, there are 60 unripened lemons left from the total number of ripe lemons harvested per day.;
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out the length and width of the room in feet. From the given information, we know that the length is 12 feet (kaki) and the width is 11 feet (kaki). Now, let's calculate how long the room is longer than its width. To do this, we can use the formula: Length = Width + Depth Where ""Depth"" represents the distance from one wall to the opposite wall. In this case, since there is no depth mentioned in the problem statement, we assume that the depth is zero. Therefore, the equation becomes: Length = Width + 0 = 11 + 0 = 11 feet So, the room is 11 feet longer than its width.";
Response:  We know that Kamar Jesse is 7 feet long (kaki). So, we can convert his length to inches as follows:  Kamar Jesse = 7 x 12 = 84 inches. Now, let's find out how wide he wants his carpet to be:  Karpet ukuran 14 kaki persegi = 14 x 36 = 504 square inches. Therefore, the width of Kamar Jesse's carpet will be:  LeBar kamarnya = 504 - 84 = 420 inches.;
Response:  We know that Kamar Jesse is 7 feet tall (kamar jesse = 7). And we also know that he needs a carpet with an area of 14 square feet (ukuran karpet = 14). So, to find out how long his room is, we can use the formula: length of room = height x area of carpet / 12. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: length of room = (7) x (14) / 12 = 9 feet. Therefore, Kamar Jesse's room is 9 feet long.;
Response:  If Kamar Jesse is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, then his area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. To cover the entire floor with carpet, he needs more than 165 square feet of carpet because there are edges that need to be covered as well. So, we can estimate that he needs at least 200-250 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the number of square feet of carpet needed to cover the entire floor is between 200-250 square feet.;
Response:  We know that Kamar Jesse is 2 feet tall and 12 feet wide. To cover the entire floor with tiles, we need to calculate how many tiles he needs based on his height and width.  Since each tile covers an area of 4 square feet, we can divide Kamar Jesse's height by 4 to find out how many tiles he needs for his height. So, Kamar Jesse needs 2/4 = 0.5 tiles for his height. Similarly, since his width is 12 feet, he needs 12 / 4 = 3 tiles for his width. Therefore, in total, Kamar Jesse needs 0.5 x 3 = 1.5 tiles to cover his entire body.;
Response:  We know that Kamal has 20 rooms and each room needs to be covered with carpet. So we need to calculate how many square feet of carpet are needed for all 20 rooms. The length of one room is 19 feet, and the width is 18 feet. To find out how much area the carpet needs to cover, we can multiply the length and width of each room: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 352 square feet Now, since there are 20 rooms in total, we need to multiply the area of each room by 20 to get the total area of carpet needed: Total Area = 352 sq ft x 20 = 7040 square feet Therefore, Kamar needs 7040 square feet of carpet to cover all 20 rooms.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kamar Jesse is 19 feet long and 20 feet wide. Now, let's calculate the area of the room. The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula A = length x width. In this case, the area of the room is: Area = length x width = 19 x 20 = 380 square feet. Next, we need to find out how much longer Kamar Jesse is than its own area. To do this, we divide the length of the room (in feet) by its own area (in square feet). So, if we divide 19 by 380, we get: 19 / 380 = 0.050 or approximately 5 inches. Therefore, Kamar Jesse is approximately 5 inches longer than his own area.;
Response:  We know that Jesse wants to buy a carpet with an area of 10 square feet to cover his room. Since we are given that the length of the room is 5 feet, we can find out how wide it is by dividing its length by 2. So, the width of the room is 5/2 = 2.5 feet. Now, we multiply the width and length of the room to get the total area of the room: Area = Width x Length = 2.5 x 5 = 12.5 square feet. Therefore, Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 12.5 square feet to cover his room.;
Response:  We know that Jesse wants to cover his room with a carpet of size 10 square feet. Since we don't have any information about the length of the room, let's assume it is 2 feet long (since the width is given as 2 feet). Therefore, the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 2 ft x 2 ft = 4 sq ft Now, since Jesse wants to cover the entire room with a carpet of size 10 square feet, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of the carpet: Area of carpet / Area of room = 10 sq ft / 4 sq ft = 2.5 So, Jesse needs a carpet that is approximately 2.5 times longer than the length of his room.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has already covered 18 square feet of carpet on the floor (which is equal to 18 x 12 = 216 square inches). Now, we need to find out how many more square inches he needs to cover the entire floor. To do this, we can use the dimensions of the room provided in the question: The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, which means its area is 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. So, the total area of the floor that Jesse needs to cover with carpet is: 216 - 80 = 136 square inches. Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 136 square inches of carpet to cover the entire floor.;
Response:  We know that Toko Kaos Razorback made $23 from each t-shirt sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, if they sold x t-shirts, they would have earned $23x. Since they earned $230 in total, we can set up the equation: $23x = $230. Now, dividing both sides of the equation by $23 gives us: x = 10. Therefore, Toko Kaos Razorback sold 10 t-shirts during the game.;
Response:  We know that Toko Kaos sold 3 shirts during their game against Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, we can calculate the total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Shirts Sold x Price per Shirt Total Revenue = 3 x $ 51 Total Revenue = $ 153 Now, we need to find out how much each shirt cost. To do this, we divide the total revenue by the number of shirts sold: Cost per Shirt = Total Revenue / Number of Shirts Sold Cost per Shirt = $ 153 / 3 Cost per Shirt = $ 51 per shirt Therefore, each shirt costs $ 51.;
Response:  During the Arkansas game, they sold 95 shirts and made $87 per shirt. So, in total, they made $8375 from selling shirts during the Arkansas game ($95 x $87). Now, let's find out how much money they made from selling shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they sold 47 shirts during the Texas Tech game, they made $4095 from selling shirts during that game ($87 x 47). Therefore, the amount of money they made from selling shirts during the Arkansas game is $8375 - $4095 = $4280.;
Response:  If they sold 106 dollars per each t-shirt during the Arkansas game and they sold a total of 242 t-shirts during both games, then we can calculate how many t-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game as follows: Total revenue = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt Total revenue = 242 t-shirts x 106 dollars/t-shirt = 25,380 dollars During the Texas Tech game, they sold 25,380 dollars worth of t-shirts, so they sold 115 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.;
Response:  During the Arkansas game, they sold 89 shirts, and according to the passage, each shirt generates $98 in revenue. So, the total revenue from selling shirts during the Arkansas game is:  $98 x 89 = $8712.  Now, let's find out how much money they made from selling shirts during the Texas Tech game. According to the passage, they sold a total of 163 shirts during both games. Since they didn't sell any shirts during the Texas Tech game, the number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game is equal to the total number of shirts sold - the number of shirts sold during the Texas Tech game:  $8712 / (163 - 89) = $8712 / 74 = $1150 per game. Therefore, they made $1150 per game from selling shirts during the Arkansas game.;
Response:  During the Arkansas game, they sold 186 t-shirts and made $ 78 per shirt. Therefore, they earned a total of $ 1492 during the Arkansas game ($ 78 x 186). Now, let's find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game. Since they sold 172 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, their total earnings from t-shirt sales during that game are $ 1356 ( $ 78 x 172). So, the difference in their earnings between the two games is $ 1356 - $ 1492 = $ -136.;
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 31. If each shirt costs $ 99, then the total revenue from shirts is $ 31 x $ 99 = $ 3079.  Now we need to find out how many towels were sold. According to the problem, the total number of towels sold is equal to 183 - 31 = 152 towels. If each towel costs $ 62, then the total revenue from towels is $ 152 x $ 62 = $ 9344. Therefore, the total amount of money that Toko Razorback made during the game is $ 3079 + $ 9344 = $ 12423.;
"Response:  The total number of jerseys sold is given as 156. Since each jersey sells for $165, the total revenue from jersey sales is:

$165 x 156 = $25,900
Therefore, the amount of money that Toko Razorback can get from selling jerseys is $25,900.";
Response:  The cost of each toko razorback item is as follows:  Kaos - $ 192 Jerseys - $ 34 So if they sold 157 kaos and 19 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, we can calculate the total revenue from each product as follows: Kaos - 157 x $ 192 = $ 28,604 Jerseys - 19 x $ 34 = $ 646 Total Revenue - $ 28,604 + $ 646 = $ 29,250 Therefore, the price of each toko razorback jersey is more expensive than the price of each kaos by $ 29,250 / $ 646 = $ 45.67;
Response:  The total revenue from selling t-shirts is given as $ 86 x 254 = $ 21,960. Similarly, the total revenue from selling jerseys is given as $ 232 x 43 = $ 9,756. So, the total revenue is $ 21,960 + $ 9,756 = $ 31,716. Therefore, the price of each jersey is $ 31,716 / 43 = $ 730.;
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold is given as 130. If each t-shirt costs $ 51, then the total revenue from selling t-shirts is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price of each t-shirt  Revenue = 130 x $ 51  Revenue = $ 6,430 So, the amount of money they earned from selling t-shirts is $ 6,430.;
Response:  The total number of shirts sold = Total number of shirts available x Price per shirt = 14 x $ 201 = $ 2850 So, they earned $ 2850 from selling their shirts.;
Response:  If they sold $60 worth of Razorback merchandise during the game, and they made $10 per t-shirt sold, then we can calculate how many t-shirts they sold as follows:  Number of t-shirts = Total revenue / Price per t-shirt So, in this case, number of t-shirts = $60 / $10 = 6 t-shirts Therefore, they sold 6 t-shirts during the game.;
Response:  If the total amount of money earned from selling shirts is $215 and there are 5 shirts sold, then we can calculate the price of each shirt as follows: $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt. Therefore, the price of each Arkansas Razorback shirt was $43.;
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is 64. Since each shirt costs $215, the total revenue from shirts is $64 x $215 = $13,760. Now, let's calculate the total revenue from tank tops. Each tank top costs $5, so the total revenue from tank tops is 20 x $5 = $100. Therefore, the total revenue from both shirts and tank tops is $13,760 + $100 = $13,860.;
Response:  The total amount of money generated from selling t-shirts is given as $204. Since they sold 2 t-shirts during the game, we can find out how much each t-shirt was sold for by dividing the total amount of money generated by the number of t-shirts sold: $$ \therefore \frac{204}{2} = 102 $$ So, each t-shirt was sold for $102. Now, let's find out how much each jersey was sold for by dividing the total amount of money generated by the number of jerseys sold: $$ \therefore \frac{76}{1} = 76 $$ So, each jersey was sold for $76. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from selling jerseys is $76 x 2 = $152.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toko Razorback makes $ 210 from each jersey and $ 240 from each t-shirt. Therefore, if they sell 23 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, their total revenue from jerseys would be: 23 x $ 210 = $ 5,030. Similarly, if they sell 177 t-shirts during the same game, their total revenue from t-shirts would be: 177 x $ 240 = $ 46,980. Now, to find out which one is more expensive, let's compare the two amounts: $ 5,030 (jerseys) vs. $ 46,980 (t-shirts). Based on this comparison, we can conclude that the price of the t-shirts is more than twice as much as the price of the jerseys. So, the answer to the question is: The price of the t-shirts is more than twice as much as the price of the jerseys.;
Response:  The total revenue from selling jerseys is given as $115 per jersey and $25 per t-shirt. So, the total revenue from selling both jerseys and t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of Jerseys x Price Per Jersey + Number of T-Shirts x Price Per T-Shirt Total Revenue = 113 jerseys x $115/jersey + 78 t-shirts x $25/t-shirt Total Revenue = $90,675 Now, we are asked to find out how much more expensive the jerseys are compared to the t-shirts. To do this, we need to subtract the price of each t-shirt from the price of each jersey: Cost Difference = Price of Each Jersery - Price of Each T-Shirt Cost Difference = $115/jersey - $25/t-shirt Cost Difference = $90 per jersey Therefore, the cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt is $90.;
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. However, since they only have 5 tables, the total number of chairs per table is 50 / 5 = 10 chairs per table. Therefore, there are more than 10 chairs for every table they have.;
Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables with the same number of chairs. So, if we have x chairs in one table, then we have x/2 chairs in the other table. Since there are a total of 12 chairs, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x/2) = 12. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 24. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 12. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.;
Response:  If they have 9 chairs in their backyard and each table has 3 chairs, then we can say that they have 9 / 3 = 3 sets of tables. Therefore, they have 3 sets of tables.;
Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 11 x 13 = 133 chairs. So, they have 133 chairs in their backyard.;
Response:  If they have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  Since there are 11 people sitting, that means 50 chairs are left empty (60 - 11 = 50). Therefore, 50 chairs are left empty.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs plus 6 extra chairs. So, in total, they have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Since each chair can accommodate two people, the total number of guests they can accommodate is 168 / 2 = 84 guests. Therefore, the correct answer is 84 guests.;
Response:  If they have 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since there will be 14 people attending the party, we need to buy additional chairs for the remaining 2 people. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14 chairs that they need to buy.;
Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables and each set has 4 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 9 x 4 = 36 chairs. Since they only have 14 chairs in total, that means there are 36 - 14 = 22 more chairs than the number of tables they have. Therefore, the answer is 22.;
Response:  If Jika Lewis produces a total of $ 460 during 5 weeks of harvest and he can get how much money each week, then we can write an equation as follows: Total amount produced = Amount earned per week x Number of weeks Total amount produced = $ 460 x 5 Weekly income = $ 82 per week Now we have two equations and one variable (weekly income). We can solve for the variable using substitution or elimination method. Using substitution method, we get: $ 82 = $ 460 / 5 $ 16 = $ 82 / 5 $ 16 / 5 = $ 3.2 $ 3.2 = $ 82 / 5 Therefore, Jika Lewis can earn $ 3.2 per week.;
"Response:  If Lewis produces a total of $ 1216 during harvest, and he gets $ 16 per week for how many weeks the harvest lasts, we can write an equation as follows:

x = $ 1216 / $ 16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, Lewis receives $ 16 per week for 78 weeks.";
Response:  If Lewis gets $ 21 per week for 216 weeks of harvest, then he will have earned a total of $ 4,592 ($ 21 x 216) during the harvest season. However, if he has to pay taxes of $ 702, then he will be left with $ 3,890 ($ 4,592 - $ 702). Therefore, there will be $ 3,890 at the end of the harvest season.;
"Response:  If Lewis earns $ 1357 per week for 223 weeks during the harvest season, he will have earned a total of:

$ 1357 x 223 = $  $306,913

If he works for 73 harvest seasons, he will have earned a total of:

$ 306,913 x 73 = $ $22,489,333

Therefore, if Lewis works for 73 harvest seasons, he will have earned a total of approximately $22,489,333.";
Response:  If Lewis works overtime every week for how many weeks during the harvest season, he will earn additional money as follows:  Overtime pay = Total hours worked x Hourly wage (including overtime) = Total hours worked x ($28/week + $939/week)  Since there are 52 weeks in a year, if he works overtime every week for 49 weeks during the harvest season, his total overtime pay would be: Overtime pay = Total hours worked x ($28/week + $939/week) x 49 weeks = $14,763  Therefore, if he works overtime every week for 49 weeks during the harvest season, he can earn an additional $14,763.;
"Response:  If Lewis gets $ 403 per week for 233 weeks of harvest, then he will get a total amount of money during the harvest season as follows:
$ 403 x 233 = $ 93,530
Now, if he has to pay rent of $ 49 per week for how many weeks, we can calculate it as follows:
$ 49 x number of weeks = $ 1,167
So, Lewis has to pay $ 1,167 in rent during the harvest season.";
Response:  If Lewis gets $ 368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvest, and he has to pay $ 388 rent per week, then we can calculate how much money he pays as rent over that period using the formula: Rent = Total amount paid / Number of weeks rented So, in this case, the total amount paid is $ 368 x 1359 = $ 472,072, and the number of weeks rented is also 1359. Therefore, the amount Lewis pays as rent is: Rent = $ 472,072 / 1359 = $ 346,672.;
Response:  If Lewis gets $491 per week for 1181 weeks, then he will have earned a total of: $$ = \text {Total amount earned} = 1181 \times 491 = $537,011$$ Now, if he has to pay $216 rent every week for how many weeks, we can find out by dividing the total amount earned by the rent amount: $$ = \text{Number of weeks to pay rent} = \divide{537011}{216} = 2486$$ So, Lewis needs to pay $2486 x 216 = $526,032 in rent at the end of the season.;
Response:  If Lewis produces $ 133 in 19 weeks, then he must have produced $ 7 per week. So, the answer is $ 7.;
Response:  If Lewis gets $ 2 per week during harvest time, and he got a total of $ 178 for how many weeks harvest lasted? So we can write an equation as follows:  Weekly income = Total income / Number of weeks  Income = $ 178 / x  Where 'x' is the number of weeks harvest lasted. Now we need to solve for 'x'. We know that Lewis received $ 2 per week for 9 weeks (since there are 9 weeks in our given period). Therefore, his total income from these 9 weeks is:  Total income = Weekly income x Number of weeks = $ 2 x 9 = $ 18  So now we have two equations:  Income = $ 178 / x  And:  Total income = $ 18  To find out how many weeks harvest lasted, we can use either equation. For example, if we use the first equation, we get:  x = $ 178 / $ 2  x = 9 weeks  Similarly, if we use the second equation, we get:  x = 9 weeks  Therefore, Lewis got $ 178 for 9 weeks of harvest.;
"Response:  If Dean is 6 feet (72 inches) tall and he stands in water that is 9 feet deep (108 inches), then the difference between his height and the depth of the water is:  
$$ \text{Height} - \text{Depth} = 72 \text{ inches} - 108 \text{ inches} = 36 \text{ inches} $$ So, Dean is $36$ inches ($= 3 \text{ feet}$) deeper than the water level.";
Response:  We know that: * The depth of the water is twice as great as Dean's height (Dean is 8 feet tall). * Ron is 14 feet tall when he stands in the water. So, we can write: Depth = 2H + 14 = 2(8) + 14 = 32 feet. Therefore, if Ron stands in the water at a depth of 32 feet, his head will be at a height of: Head height = 32 - 8 = 24 feet above the water level.;
"Response:  We know that:
Ron is taller than Dean (Ron > Dean).
The depth of the water is 5 times greater than Ron's height (kedalaman airnya = 5 × ron).
So, if Ron stands in the water up to his waist (ron = 12 kaki), then we can calculate the distance from his feet to the surface as follows:
Distance = Height + Depth
= 12 kaki + 5 × ron
= 12 kaki + 5 × (height)
= 12 kaki + 5 × (ron)
Now we have two equations:
Equation 1: 12 kaki + 5 × ron = x
Equation 2: ron > Dean
We need to solve for x, which represents the distance from Ron's feet to the surface of the water. Can you do it?";
Response:  We know that: * The depth of the water is 15 times greater than Dean. * Dean is taller than Ron. So we can say that Dean is x feet tall and Ron is y feet tall, where x > y. * Ron stands at 13 feet in the water. To find out how much Ron will be submerged underwater, we need to subtract his height from the depth of the water. Therefore, if Ron stands at 13 feet in the water, he will be submerged by (15x - 13) feet. Now we have to solve for x. Using the information given in the problem, we can set up an equation as follows: 15x - 13 = y Where y is the height of Dean. Solving for x, we get: x = 9 feet This means that Ron will be submerged by 6 feet (15x - 13).;
Response:  We know that Ron is 16 times taller than the depth of the water. So if the depth of the water is x feet, then Ron is 16x feet tall.  Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we can say that Dean is (16x + 9) feet tall.  Now, we are told that Dean is standing in water that is 13 feet deep. So, we can set up the equation: (16x + 9) - 13 =?  Solving for x, we get: 16x = 49  X = 3 feet  Therefore, Ron is 16(3) = 48 feet tall and Dean is (16(3) + 9) = 57 feet tall.;
Response:  We know that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, so Dean's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet tall. Since the depth of the water is 9 times greater than Dean's height, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet deep.;
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among 2 bookshelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.;
Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf holds 2 books, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows: Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf = 42 / 2 = 21 shelves. Therefore, Brian has 21 shelves.;
Response:  If Brian has 27 books and each shelf holds 23 bookshelves, then he has 27 / 23 = 11 bookshelves in total.  And if he has 80 magazines per shelf, then he has 11 x 80 = 880 magazines in total. Therefore, Brian has 27 books and 880 magazines in total.;
Response:  If Brian has 9 books and each book takes up 10 shelves, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 shelves in his library.  If he also has 46 magazines and each magazine takes up 2 shelves, then he has 46 x 2 = 92 shelves in total. So, Brian has 90 + 92 = 182 shelves in his library.;
Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 shelves, then he has a total number of books equal to 23 x 29 = 647 books. Similarly, if he has 61 magazines in each of his 29 shelves, then he has a total number of magazines equal to 61 x 29 = 1809 magazines. Therefore, Brian has a total number of 647 books + 1809 magazines = 2456 items in his collection.;
Response:  If Brian has 7 shelves with each shelf containing an equal number of books, then he must have $7 \times x$ books in total, where $x$ is the number of books per shelf. Since there are $28$ books in total, we can write the equation:  $$ 7x = 28 $$  Solving for $x$, we get:  $$ x = \frac{28}{7} = 4 $$ So, there are $4$ books in each shelf.;
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books in total and each shelf holds 2 books per shelf, then we can calculate the number of shelves as follows:
Number of shelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 38 books / 2 books per shelf
= 19 shelves
Therefore, Brian has 19 shelves of books.";
Response:  If Carol wants to send out invitations for her friend's birthday party and each package of invitations she buys contains 2 invitations inside, then we can calculate how many packages she needs as follows: Number of friends = Total number of invitations needed = Number of invitations in each package x Number of packages needed = 10 friends x 2 invitations per package = 20 packages So, Carol needs 20 packages of invitations to send to all her friends.;
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to 12 friends and bought 3 packages with the same number of invitations in each package, then we can conclude that there are 12 / 3 = 4 invitations in each package. Therefore, the answer is 4.;
Response:  If Carol buys 7 packets of invitations and each packet contains 10 invitations, then she has bought a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations.  Since she is sending out invitations to only two friends, the number of remaining invitations after she sends them all out will be 70 - (2 x 10) = 40 invitations. Therefore, there will be 40 undangans left over after Carol sends them all out.;
Response:  Firstly, Carol bought 6 packets of invitations with each packet containing 14 invitations. Therefore, she has purchased a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she also bought additional 11 invitations. So, in total, Carol has purchased 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Hence, she can invite 95 friends to her party.;
Response:  If Carol wants to invite 9 friends and each package of undangans contains 3 undangans, then she needs to buy 9 x 3 = 27 additional undangans. Therefore, the total number of undangans that Carol needs to buy is 2 x 27 = 54 undangans.;
Response:  If Melissa scores 12 points in each game and she plays n games, then her total score is: Total Score = Number of Games x Points per Game Total Score = n x 12  So if we know the number of games she played, we can find out her total score. Can you please provide more information about the problem or context so I can help you further?;
Response:  If Melissa scores 81 points in each game, then she must have scored a total of 243 points (81 x 3 games). Therefore, the answer is 243.;
Response:  If Melissa scores 109 points in each game and gets 82 points as bonus, then her total score for one game is: Total Score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, let's calculate how many points she can get in 79 games: Number of Games = 79 x 191 = 14,699 points. Therefore, Melissa can get up to 14,699 points in 79 games.;
Response:  If Melissa scored 7 points in each game, then she scored a total of 7 x number of games = 21 points. So, the number of games she played is 21 / 7 = 3 games. Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.;
Response:  If Melissa scores 91 points in each game, then she must have scored at least 91 points in every game. So, we can say that her average score per game is 91 points. Now, let's calculate how many points she could have gotten in each game: Points obtained = Total points / Number of games played In this case, the total number of points is 91 x 13 = 1133 points, and the number of games played is 13. Therefore, the average points obtained per game is: Average points obtained = 1133 points / 13 games = 87 points per game.;
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the Roda Ferris at Taman Surga and 20 people can ride it simultaneously, then we need to know how many people can sit on each seat. So, let's divide 20 by 4, which gives us 5. Therefore, 5 people can sit on each seat.;
"Response:  If there are x seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and 18 people can ride at once, then we need to find out how many cars can fit on the Ferris wheel. Since each car can hold 9 people, we have:
x = 18 / 9 = 2
So, there are 2 cars per rotation of the Ferris wheel. Now, let's count the number of rotations:
Number of rotations = Total number of people - Number of people who can ride at once per car x Number of cars per rotation
= 180 - (2 x 9)
= 180 - 18
= 162
Therefore, there are 162 rotations of the Ferris wheel.";
"Response:  If each Ferris wheel has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat, then the total number of people who can ride each Ferris wheel at once is:

19 seats x 15 people/seat = 285 people

Now, let's find out how many people can ride all 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously:

285 people/Ferris wheel x 20 Ferris wheels = 5,700 people

Therefore, there can be up to 5,700 people riding the Ferris wheels in Heavenly Park at any given time.";
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the maximum capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

18 seats x 15 passengers per seat = 270 passengers
So, if 10 seats are damaged, the maximum number of passengers who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is:

270 passengers - 10 damaged seats = 260 passengers";
"Response:  If there are 6 seats in the Ferris wheel at Taman Surga and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

6 seats x 14 passengers per seat = 84 passengers

Now, if there are already 16 people in the Ferris wheel, how many more people can join it? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of people who are already in the Ferris wheel from its total capacity:

84 passengers - 16 passengers (who are already in the Ferris wheel) = 68 additional passengers

Therefore, there are 68 more people who can join the Ferris wheel.";
Response:  We know that there are 2 small chairs and 23 large chairs in total. Each small chair can accommodate 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit in the small chairs. Now, let's calculate how many people can sit in each of the large chairs. There are 23 large chairs, and each can accommodate 54 people, so we have 23 x 54 = 1208 people who can sit in the large chairs altogether. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 28 + 1208 = 1236 people.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, while each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, we have: Total number of small seats = 3 x 16 = 48 People who can sit in small seats = 48 / 3 = 16 people per small seat Total number of large seats = 7 x 12 = 84 People who can sit in large seats = 84 / 7 = 12 people per large seat Now, let's calculate how many people can ride the Ferris wheel at once: Total capacity of the Ferris wheel = Number of small seats + Number of large seats = 48 + 12 = 60 people Therefore, the answer is 60 people.;
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time in heavenly park and each seat has 4 people, then we need to know how many seats are available on the Ferris wheel. Therefore, the number of seats is equal to 16 x 4 = 64 seats. So, the answer is 64.;
Response:  If 4 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time in heavenly garden, and each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold 2 people, then we need to calculate how many seats are available on the Ferris wheel.  Therefore, there will be 4 x 2 = 8 seats available on the Ferris wheel for the 4 people to ride it simultaneously.;
Response:  If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices (irisans), then the total number of slices across all 7 pizzas is equal to 7 x Number of slices per pizza = 7 x 14 = 98 slices. Therefore, there are 98 slices in total across all 7 pizzas.;
Response:  If we buy $X$ pizzas and each pizza has $2$ slices, then the total number of slices is $2X$. Since there are $30$ slices in total, we can set up the equation: $$2X = 30$$ Solving for $X$, we get: $$X = \frac{30}{2} = 15$$ So, if we buy $15$ pizzas, there will be a total of $2 \times 15 = 30$ slices.;
Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. Therefore, we have a total of 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. So there are 68 slices of pizza in total.;
Response:  If we buy 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Now, if we distribute them equally among 2 people, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 45 places where they put their flowers to sleep, then the total number of seeds they planted is:  45 x 10 = 450 seeds. Therefore, there are 450 benih that they have planted.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 45 seeds in total at 9 places, then they must have planted an equal number of seeds (45/9 = x) at each place. Since there are 30 days in April, we can assume that one seed grows into three flowers per day, so the total number of flowers produced is 30x. Therefore, the number of seeds planted at each place is 30x/9 = 3600.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 36 seeds in total, then they must have planted 36 / 2 = 18 seeds per location (since there are two locations). Since only 58 of the 120 seeds grew into flowers at each location, we can find out how many locations there are as follows: Number of locations = Total number of seeds that grew into flowers / Number of seeds per location = 58 x 18 = 1040 locations. Therefore, Paige and her mother had 1040 places to plant their flowers.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 55 seeds in total, then they must have planted x number of seeds at each location where they planted bunga. Since there are 15 seeds per location, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 15 = 55  Now, let's solve for x:  To do this, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:  Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:  x = 40  Therefore, Paige and her mother planted 40 seeds at each location where they planted bunga. So, the total number of bunga that grew was 40 x 60 = 2400 bunga.;
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 6 places (beds), then they have 6 x 10 = 60 seeds in total. So, they have 60/2 = 30 places to sleep where they have planted beds with flowers.;
Response:  If they planted the same number of seeds at each flower bed, then the total number of seeds they planted is equal to the number of flower beds multiplied by the number of seeds they planted per flower bed.  Therefore, if they planted 32 seeds in total and there are 8 flower beds, the number of seeds they planted per flower bed is:  Number of seeds/Total number of seeds = 8/32 = 1/4. So, they planted 1 seed per quarter of the flower bed.;
Response:  If Matthew has 5 biscuits and he gives 2 to each of his 11 friends, then how many biscuits does Matthew have left?  We can count the number of biscuits that Matthew gave away: 2 x 11 = 22 biscuits. So, Matthew has 5 - 22 = -17 biscuits left. Therefore, the correct answer is -17.;
Response:  If Matthew has 8 biscuits to share with his friends and he gives 2 crackers for each friend, then the number of friends he will give crackers to is 8 / 2 = 4 friends. Therefore, there are 4 friends who will receive crackers from Matthew.;
"Response:  If Matthew has 15 biscuits and gives each of his 5 friends an equal amount (i.e., if he gives one friend 3 biscuits, then the other four friends will also get 3 biscuits), then the total number of biscuits given away is:

15 biscuits x 5 friends = 75 biscuits

Now, let's see how many biscuits are left for Matthew after giving them all away:

10 biscuits - 75 biscuits = -65 biscuits

So, there are -65 biscuits left for Matthew after giving them all away to his friends.";
Response:  If Matthew has 24 biscuits and he gives an equal amount to each of his three friends, then he will give 24 / 3 = 8 biscuits to each friend. So, in total, Matthew gave away 8 x 3 = 24 biscuits. Now, let's check how many biscuits Matthew has left after giving them away. He had 24 - 24 = 0 biscuits left. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.;
Response:  If Matthew has 22 biscuits and 34 cookies to share with his friends, then he will have 22/11 = 2 biscuits left for each of his 11 friends. Similarly, if he gives them an equal number of cookies (34/11 = 3 cookies) per person, then there are 2 + 3 = 5 cookies leftover after sharing with all 11 friends. Therefore, there are 5 cookies leftover in total.;
Response:  If Matthew has 29 biscuits and 30 kue, then he has a total of 59 items (29 biscuits + 30 kue).  If he gives an equal amount to each of his two friends, then they will receive 29.5 items each (since there are 59 items in total and 2 friends). Since a kue is worth more than a biscuit (according to the question), we can assume that each friend will eat approximately half as many kues as biscuits. Therefore, each friend will eat 14.75 kues (half of 29.5). So, Matthew's two friends together will eat 28.5 kues (14.75 x 2).;
Response:  If Matthew has 14 biscuits and 21 kue, then he has a total of 35 treats (biscuits + kue).  Since there are 7 friends sharing these treats, each friend will get an equal share of 5 treats (35 / 7 = 5). So, each person will eat 5 biscuits and 5 kue.;
Response:  If Matthew has 36 crackers and he wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, then each friend will get 2 crackers (since 36 / 18 = 2). Now, if each person eats 3 crackers, how many crackers are left? So, there are 2 x 3 = 6 crackers left after everyone eats their fair share.;
Response:  If Matthew has 6 biscuits to share with each of his friends, and he has 36 friends in total, then he will have to give out 36 x 6 = 216 biscuits altogether. So, there are 216 biscuits in total.;
Response:  If Matthew has 23 biscuits and he gives an equal number of biscuits to each of his two friends, then he will have given them 23 / 2 = 11 biscuits each. So, each friend got 11 biscuits.;
Response:  If Matthew has 31 biscuits and he gives an equal amount (31) to each of his 5 friends, then how many biscuits will each friend get?  Each friend will get 31/5 = 6 biscuits. So, in total, Matthew gave away 6 x 5 = 30 biscuits. Therefore, there are 31 - 30 = 1 biscuit left with Matthew.;
Response:  If Matthew has 32 crackers and wants to share them equally among 4 friends, each friend will get 8 crackers (32 / 4 = 8). Now, if he also has 98 cookies and wants to share them equally among the same 4 friends, each friend will get 24 cookies (98 / 4 = 24). So, there are 8 crackers per person and 24 cookies per person.;
Response:  If Matthew has 10 biscuits and 8 kue at the beginning, then he gives each of his 4 friends an equal amount (i.e., 2 biscuits and 3 kue). So, after giving them out, Matthew will have 10 - 2 = 8 biscuits left, and 8 - 3 = 5 kue left. Therefore, each friend gets to eat 3 kue.;
Response:  If Matthew has 13 biscuits and 15 kue at the beginning, then he gives each of his 28 friends an equal amount (not necessarily the same number) of both biscuits and kue. So, if we divide the total number of biscuits (13) and kue (15) equally among all 28 friends, we get:  Number of biscuits per friend = 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 biscuits per person)  Number of kue per friend = 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 kue per person)  Therefore, there are approximately 4-5 biscuits and 5-6 kue consumed by each of Matthew's 28 friends.;
"Response:  If Debbie buys several bottles of water during a discount period and drinks 109 bottles per day, we can calculate how many bottles she bought based on the number of days the discount lasted.  The discount lasted for 74 days, so if Debbie drank 109 bottles per day, she must have consumed a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of bottles per day} $$

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = 74 \times 109 = 8263 $$

Therefore, Debbie bought $8263$ bottles of water during the discount period.";
Response:  If Debbie buys 153 bottles of air at a discounted price and drinks the same number of bottles every day, then she will have consumed 153 x 17 = 2491 bottles of air in total over those 17 days. So, she consumes 2491/153 = 16.38 bottles of air per day.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 264 bottles of air when they were discounted and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has in total as follows:  Number of bottles drunk = Total number of bottles x Number of days used = 15 x 11 = 165  Since Debbie had 264 bottles initially, that means she still has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left. So, Debbie has 99 bottles of air left.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 301 bottles of air when they were discounted and drank 144 bottles per day for several days, then she had x bottles left after that period. Since she drank 144 bottles per day, we can write an equation as follows:  x = (301 - 144 \* number of days) / 144  Now, we need to find out how many days passed since Debbie started drinking the air. We know that she drank 144 bottles per day for several days, so let's assume that the number of days is 'n'. Substituting this value into our previous equation, we get:  x = (301 - 144 \* n) / 144  To solve for 'x', we can simplify the equation as follows:  x = (157) / 144  Therefore, Debbie has 157 bottles of air left after drinking 144 bottles per day for several days.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale, then she has a total of 101 bottles (88 + 13).  If she drinks 4 bottles of water per day, how many days will it take for her to finish all 88 bottles of water?  We can use division to find out:  Number of days = Total number of bottles / Amount drunk per day  In this case, the number of days is:  Number of days = 101 / 4 = 25.25 days  So, in approximately 25.25 days, Debbie will finish all 88 bottles of water.;
Response:  If Debbie buys 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they are on sale, then she has a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drinks 312 bottles of water in a certain number of days, then she will have 144 bottles of soda left after that period (456 - 312 = 144).  Therefore, if she drinks 312 bottles of water per day for how many days, there will be 144 bottles of soda left?  The answer is 144 / 312 = 47 days.;
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she buys a total of 12 bottles of water in how many days will they last her?  To find out, we need to divide the number of bottles she bought (12) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (6). So, the answer is 12 / 6 = 2 days. Therefore, the water will last Debbie for 2 days.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she has a total of 275 bottles (95 + 180).  If she drank 15 bottles of water per day, how many days will it last her? To find out, we need to divide the number of bottles of water left by the number of bottles drunk per day: Number of days = Total bottles / Amount drunk per day = 275 / 15 = 18 days So, after 18 days, all of the bottles of water will be finished.;
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she has a total of 522 bottles (360 + 162).  If she drank 122 bottles of water in a certain number of days, then the number of days is equal to the number of bottles divided by the amount of water drunk per day. So, if she drinks 122 bottles of water in x days, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of days = Total bottles / Amount of water drunk per day  In this case, the total number of bottles is 522, and the amount of water drunk per day is 122. Therefore, we can solve for the number of days as follows:  Number of days = 522 / 122 = 4  So, Debbie will run out of soda in 4 days after she finishes drinking all the water she purchased.;
"Response:  If Faye has 14 rows of pensils and each row contains 11 pensils, then the total number of pensils that Faye has is:

14 rows x 11 pensils per row = 154 pensils

Therefore, Faye has 154 pensils in total.";
Response:  If Faye places 12 pensils in total, then she must have placed 4 pensils in each of the 3 bars (since there are 3 bars). So, the number of pensils that Faye placed in each bar is 4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.;
Response:  If Faye has 28 bags of pensils with 24 pens in each bag, then she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 pensils. Since she wants to place them in rows, we need to divide this number by the number of rows she can make.  We know that there are 16 pensils in each row, so we can calculate the number of rows as follows:  Number of rows = Total number of pensils / Number of pensils in each row  Number of rows = 672 pensils / 16 pensils per row  Number of rows = 43 rows Therefore, Faye can make 43 rows of pensils.;
Response:  If Faye has 22 pensils in each row and she has 6 rows, then the total number of pensils she has is:  22 x 6 = 132 pensils. So, Faye has 132 pensils in total.;
Response:  If Faye has 35 pensils and she wants to arrange them in rows of 5 pensils each, then she will need at least 7 rows (since there are 7 pensils in total). So, the number of bars that can be created is 7.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 4 pensils in each of the 19 rows, so the total number of pensils she has is:  Number of pensils = Total number of rows x Number of pensils per row = 19 x 4 = 76 pensils. Therefore, Faye has 76 pensils.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 rows of pensils and each row contains 36 pensils. Therefore, the total number of pensils owned by Faye is:  Total number of pensils = Number of rows x Number of pensils in each row  Total number of pensils = 7 x 36  Total number of pensils = 252 pensils;
"Response:  We know that Faye has 31 pensils and 27 krayons in each of the 11 rows. Therefore, she has a total of:

Pensils: 31 x 11 = 341 pensils
Krayons: 27 x 11 = 307 krayons
So, Faye has 341 pensils and 307 krayons in total.";
Response:  If Faye places 30 pensils in a row and each row has 5 pensils, then the total number of rows is: Total Number of Rows = Number of Pensils / Number of Pensils per Row = 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 rows that Faye can make with 30 pensils.;
Response:  If Faye has 6 pensils and she wants to place them in two rows of equal length, then we can assume that each row will have 3 pensils (since there are 6 pensils total). So, if Faye places 3 pensils in one row, how many pensils will she place in the other row?  We know that the number of pensils in each row is equal, so if one row has 3 pensils, the other row must also have 3 pensils. Therefore, the total number of pensils placed by Faye is 6 (the number of pensils she had) divided by 2 (the number of rows she created), which equals 3.;
"Response:  If Faye has 35 pensils and she wants to place them in rows of 2 pensils each, then we can start with the first row. So, the number of pensils in the first row is 2 (since there are 2 pensils in each row). Now, let's count how many rows Faye can make using all 35 pensils:

1st Row: 2 pensils
2nd Row: 2 pensils - 2 pensils = 0 pensils (since we have already used 2 pensils in the first row)
3rd Row: 2 pensils - 2 pensils = 0 pensils (again, since we have already used 2 pensils in the second row)
...
35th Row: 2 pensils - 2 pensils = 0 pensils (and so on)

So, Faye can make at most 34 rows of pensils. Therefore, the answer is 34.";
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 bungkus pensil in total. Each bungkus contains 6 pensil, so the total number of pensil is 31 x 6 = 186 pensil. Therefore, Faye has 186 pensil in total.;
Response:  We know that Faye has 30 rows of pensils and each row contains either 71 or 24 pensils. So, in total, she has 30 x (71 + 24) = 30 x 95 = 2850 pensils. Therefore, Faye has 2850 pensils.;
Response:  If Faye has 6 pensils in each of the 16 rows, then she has a total of 6 x 16 = 96 pensils.  So, Faye has 96 pensils in total.;
"Response:  We know that there are 98 students and 7 buses. Since each bus can accommodate a certain number of seats, we need to find out how many seats are available in each bus.  Therefore, the total number of seats available for all 7 buses is:
Seats per bus x Number of buses = Total number of seats available
= (Number of seats per bus) x 7
= 98 students x 7 buses = 696 seats
So, there are approximately 696 seats available in all 7 buses combined.";
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 84 classrooms in the school.  Secondly, each bus is full with 118 seats. Therefore, the total number of students who can go for field trips is equal to the number of classrooms divided by the number of seats in each bus. So, we have: Number of students = Total number of classrooms / Total number of seats in each bus  In this case, the total number of classrooms is 84 and the total number of seats in each bus is 118. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students as follows: Number of students = 84 / 118 = 70  So, there are approximately 70 students from this school who will be going for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms and 66 students per classroom. Therefore, we need to calculate how many classes there will be based on this information.  There are 66 students per classroom x 67 classrooms = 4281 students total. Now, we need to divide the number of students by the number of seats available on each bus to determine how many buses are needed. The number of seats available on each bus is given as 6 seats per bus. So, 4281 students / 6 seats per bus = 713 buses needed.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students will be going for the field trip. Since there are 58 students in total and each class has the same number of students (87 - 58 = 29), then the total number of students going for the field trip is 58 x 29 = 1640 students.  Next, we need to calculate the number of buses needed based on the number of students going for the field trip. As there are 2 students in each bus, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to get the number of buses required: 1640 / 2 = 820 buses. Therefore, 820 buses are needed to transport all the students for the field trip.;
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms and 120 students in total at this school. Since each classroom has the same number of students, we can assume that each classroom has 5 students (120/24). Now, let's calculate how many students are in each bus based on the information provided: There are 84 seats in each bus, which means that each bus can accommodate 84/5 = 16.8 students. So, since there are 3 buses, the total number of students who will be going on the field trip is 16.8 x 3 = 50.4 students. Therefore, there are approximately 50.4 students in each kelas (class).;
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students will go for the field trip. Since there are 102 students in total and 8 seats available in each bus, we can calculate the number of students who can go for the field trip as follows: Number of students who can go = Total number of students x Available seats per bus = 102 x 8 = 808 students Therefore, 808 students will go for the field trip. Now, let's assume that 22 students do not want to go for the field trip. So, the remaining number of students who can go for the field trip is: Remaining students = Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go = 102 - 22 = 80 students;
Response:  If there are 102 classrooms and 11 students, then each student will go to different classrooms. So, if 8 students do not want to go for the field trip, that means 3 students will stay behind (since 11 - 8 = 3). Therefore, 99 students will go for the field trip (since 99 x 3 / 11 = 99).;
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms and 3 students per classroom, so we have 72 x 3 = 216 students in total. Now, we need to find out how many buses are needed for transportation. To do this, we divide the number of students by the capacity of each bus: 216 students / 3 students per bus = 72 buses. Therefore, 72 buses are needed to transport all the students.;
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms and 92 students in the school. If all the buses are full, then the number of students who can fit in each bus is equal to the number of seats available in each bus. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students (92) by the number of seats available in each bus (which we will find out later). So, the answer is: Number of students who can fit in each bus = Total number of students / Number of seats available in each bus.;
Response:  If there are 11 students in class Haley and they all like playing with marbles, then Haley has 11 x 9 = 99 marbles in total. So, Haley has 99 marbles.;
Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and she gives 5 marbles to each of the boys, then the total number of marbles given away is:  10 - (5 x 4) = 10 - 20 = 0 marbles left with Haley. So, there are no marbles left with Haley.;
Response:  If there are 4 boys in class Haley and each boy wants to get 15 marbles for themselves, then we need to divide 15 marbles among them equally. So, each boy will receive 15/4 = 3.75 marbles. Since you cannot give a fraction of a marble, each boy will receive 4 whole marbles. Therefore, the answer is 4 marbles per boy.;
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing soccer and 50 boys who like playing cards, then the total number of boys is 13 + 50 = 63 boys. Since Haley has 26 marbles to distribute among them, each boy will receive $\frac{26}{63} = \boxed{0.41}$ marbles.;
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and there are 5 boys in her class who like to play with balls, then each boy will get how many marbles?  We can divide 20 by 5 to find out:  So each boy will get 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4).;
Response:  If there are x number of boys in class Haley and she gives 2 marbles to each boy, then the total number of marbles given is 2x. Since Haley has 28 marbles, if there are x number of boys in class Haley, then the number of marbles she gives away is 2x / x = 2. Therefore, there are 14 boys in class Haley (since 2 x 14 = 28).;
Response:  If Frank is reading his favorite book and it has 392 pages, then he reads 14 pages per day. To find out how many days he spends reading the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:  Number of days = Total pages / Daily pages = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank will spend 27 days to finish reading his favorite book.;
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and takes 569 days to finish his book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages read per day So, in this case, we have: Number of pages = 569 days x 22 pages/day Number of pages = 12,378 pages Now, let's simplify the calculation: 12,378 pages / 22 pages/day =?  The answer is: There are approximately 560 pages in Frank's book.;
Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish reading his book, which means he read for x number of hours per day. Since there are 24 chapters in the book, and each chapter has an equal number of pages (halaman), we can set up the following equation: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish the book  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of pages read per day = 612 pages / 6 days = 102 pages per day Now, since Frank read for x number of hours per day, we can also write this as: Time taken to read one page = Number of hours read per day / Number of pages read per day  Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get: Time taken to read one page = 102 pages / 6 hours = 17 minutes per page Therefore, Frank took 17 minutes to read each page of his book.;
Response:  We know that Frank has to read 555 pages in total and he needs 220 days to finish reading the book. So, we can calculate the number of pages per day as follows: Number of pages per day = Total pages / Time taken to finish reading the book Time taken to finish reading the book = 555 pages x 1 page/day = 555 days Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the time taken to finish reading the book from days to weeks as follows: Time taken to finish reading the book (in weeks) = 555 days / 7 days/week = 80 weeks Therefore, each bab in the book contains an equal number of pages, which is 80/5 = 16 pages per bab.;
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish reading his book. Since there are 15 chapters in total, each chapter has an equal number of pages (halaman). So, if we divide the total number of pages (193) by the number of chapters (15), we get the average number of pages per chapter: 193 / 15 = 12.87 pages per chapter. Now, let's calculate how many pages Frank read per day: 660 days / 12.87 pages per chapter = approximately 51.4 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately 51.4 pages of his book every day for 660 days.;
Response:  If Frank takes 3 days to finish each book and each book has 249 pages, then he will take 3 x 249 = 747 pages to finish all the books in total. So, he reads 747 pages per day.;
Response:  If Frank takes 12 days to complete each book and he reads x books in total, then the time taken by him to read all the books can be calculated as follows: Time taken = Total number of days required to read all the books = Number of days taken to read one book x Number of books read Total number of days = 12 days/book x x books  Since Frank reads 66 pages per book, we need to convert the number of pages read into number of books. So, the total number of pages read is: Pages read = Number of pages read per book x Number of books read Total pages = 66 pages/book x x books  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Time taken = 12 days/book x x books Total pages = 66 pages/book x x books  Now, we need to find out how many books Frank reads in total. From the question, we know that Frank spends 492 hours reading books. This means that if he reads x books, then the total time taken to read those books is: Time taken = Total number of hours spent reading books = Number of hours taken to read one book x Number of books read Total hours = 492 hours/book x x books  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Time taken = 492 hours/book x x books  Therefore, the answer to the question is: x books = 492 hours / (12 days/book)  Simplifying further, we get: x books = 40 days  So, Frank reads 40 books in total.;
Response:  If Frank takes 16 days to finish his book, then he reads at most $ \frac{112}{16} = 7$ pages per day. So, he reads $\boxed{\text {7 halaman}}$ per day.;
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total, then he will take X days to finish reading the book. We can write an equation based on this information: Number of days = Total number of pages / Daily pages read Where X is the unknown variable that represents the number of days taken by Frank to finish reading the book Substituting the values we know into the equation, we get: X = 576 / 8 = 72 days So Frank will take 72 days to finish reading the book.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank has to read 41 chapters of his book, and each chapter contains 450 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages he needs to read is:  Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 41 x 450 = 17,650 pages Secondly, we are given that it takes Frank 30 days to finish reading his book. So, we can calculate how many pages he reads per day as follows: Total number of pages / Number of days = 17,650 pages / 30 days = 585 pages per day Now, we have our answer! Frank reads approximately 585 pages per day.;
Response:  We know that Frank spent 607 days to finish his book and there are three chapters in the book with each chapter having 594 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 594 pages Chapter 2 = 594 pages Chapter 3 = 594 pages Total number of pages in the book = 3 x 594 = 1782 pages Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per day: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Number of days taken to finish the book = 1782 pages / 607 days = approximately 2.9 pages per day Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is approximately 2.9 pages.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frank spent 664 days to finish his book. Therefore, the number of pages he read per day can be calculated as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Time taken to finish the book In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 810 (2 x 405). So, if Frank took 664 days to finish the book, he must have read approximately 13 pages per day (810 pages / 664 days);
Response:  We know that the total cost of 6 Paket DVD is $120. To find out how much each pack costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of packs: $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. Therefore, each bungkus DVD costs $20.;
Response:  If each package costs $81 dollars and we want to buy 33 packages of DVDs, then we need to calculate how much it will cost to buy all those packages. To do this, we can multiply the number of packages by the price of one package: $81 x 33 = $2630. Therefore, the total cost for buying 33 packages of DVDs is $2630.;
Response:  If each package of DVD costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 for each package, then we can calculate the number of packages that can be bought with $93 as follows: Number of packages = Total amount available / Cost per package = $93 / $106 = x We know that x is an integer because we are looking to buy whole packages only. Now, we need to find out how many packages can be bought with $93. To do this, divide the total amount available ($93) by the cost per package ($106): x = $93 / $106 = 9 So, you can buy 9 packages of DVDs with $93.;
Response:  If each package of DVD costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 for every 10 packages bought, then we need to find out how many packages we have to buy to get that discount. We can do this by dividing the cost of one package ($76) by the discount amount ($25): Number of packages = Cost per package / Discount amount = $76 / $25 = 3 So, if you want to buy 3 packages of DVDs, you will pay $76 x 3 = $228 in total.;
Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...;
Response:  If we have 28 dollars and we want to buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package must cost less than $14 (28 / 2 = 14).;

To find out, divide the total number of bananas (203) by 7: 203 / 7 = 28. So, each group of bananas contains 28 bananas. Now, let's arrange the oranges into 95 groups. Each group of oranges contains how many oranges? To find out, divide the total number of oranges (63) by 95: 63 / 95 = 0.66. So, each group of oranges contains approximately 0.66 oranges.;
Response:  We have to divide both fruits into groups of equal size so that we can calculate their total number in each group.  For the bananas (pisang), let's divide them into groups of 47 bananas per group. Therefore, there will be 47 x 4 = 188 banana groups. Now, for the oranges (jeruk), let's divide them into groups of 178 oranges per group. Therefore, there will be 178 x 4 = 712 orange groups. So, the final answer is: Number of banana groups = 188 Number of orange groups = 712;
"Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Therefore, we can write this as: Number of groups = 196 Now, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. According to the question, ""There are 392 bananas in Philip's collection."" So, we can write this as: Total number of bananas = 392 / Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 So, there are 2 bananas in each group.";
Response:  We know that there are 18 pieces of pineapple in Philip's collection and each piece is placed in one of 18 groups. So, if we divide 180 pineapples among these 18 groups, then each group will contain 10 pineapples (180/18 = 10). Therefore, there are 10 groups of pineapples in Philip's collection.;
Response:  We have 290 pieces of bananas and we want to divide them into 2 groups. Each group can contain at most 146 pieces of bananas (since there are 146 x 2 = 292 pieces of bananas in total). So, we will divide the 290 bananas into 2 groups of size at most 146 each. Now, let's consider how many groups of mangoes we can make with these banana groups. Since there are 93 x 2 = 186 pieces of mangoes in total, we can make at most 186/146 = 1.25 groups of mangoes for each group of bananas. Therefore, if we divide the 290 bananas into 2 groups, we can make at most 1.25 x 2 = 2.5 groups of mangoes.;

Response:  If Brenda prepares 38 kue and each of them has 19 pieces, then the total number of kue she prepared is: 38 x 19 = 702 kue. So, Brenda prepared 702 kue for her guests.;
Response:  If Brenda makes 14 people and each person has 30 pieces of cake, then how many total pieces of cake does she make in total?  Total = Number of people x Number of pieces per person  Total = 14 x 30  Total = 420 pieces of cake;
Response:  If Brenda makes 22 kue for 5 people and she has to throw away 17 kue, then the number of kue each person gets is: Number of kue per person = Total number of kue / Number of people  In this case, the total number of kue is 22 (which Brenda made) and the number of people is 5. So, we can calculate the number of kue each person gets as follows: Number of kue per person = 22 / 5 = 4.4 kue per person Since there are 5 people in total, the total number of kue that each person will get is 4.4 x 5 = 22 kue. Therefore, if Brenda throws away 17 kue, then each person will have 22 - 17 = 5 kue left.;
Response:  If Brenda prepared 18 kue for 10 guests and only 9 guests came, then she had 9 excess kue (18 - 9 = 9). Since each guest received an equal amount of kue, the number of kue each guest received is also 9 (9 / 10 = 0.9). So, each guest had 0.9 kue (or 9/10) more than they needed.;
Response:  If Brenda makes 14 cakes for 2 guests and each guest has an equal number of cakes, then the total number of cakes that each guest will have is half of 14, which is 7. So, if Brenda makes 14 cakes for 2 guests, each guest will have 7 cakes.;

Response:  If Shirley is selling 25 Kotak Bunga Trefoil and each Kotak contains 14 Kotak Trefoil inside it, then we need to find out how many Kotak Trefoil Shirley needs to send. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Kotak Trefoil = Total number of Kotak x Number of Kotak per Kotak  In this case, the total number of Kotak is 25 (given in the question), and the number of Kotak per Kotak is 14 (also given in the question). Now, we can plug these values into the equation: Number of Kotak Trefoil = 25 x 14 = 350 Kotak Trefoil Therefore, Shirley needs to send 350 Kotak Trefoil if she has sold 25 Kotak Bunga Trefoil.;
Response:  If Shirley has 10 Kotak Trefoil and she needs to give 5 cases of boxes, then we need to divide 10 by 5. So, there are 2 cases of boxes in each case. Therefore, the answer is 2.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 67 + 9 = 76. Since we are asked about the number of regular soda bottles, we can conclude that the number of Diet soda bottles is 9. Therefore, the number of regular soda bottles is 76 - 9 = 67. So, the answer is 67.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 83 (22 + 61). Now we need to find out how many bottles of diet soda there are compared to regular soda. So, if the store has 61 bottles of diet soda, this means they have x - 22 = 49 bottles of regular soda. Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda is greater than the number of regular soda by 49 - 22 = 27 bottles.;
"Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of regular sodas and the number of diet sodas plus the number of apples. So we can write an equation as follows:

Total Number of Bottles = Number of Regular Sodas + Number of Diet Sodas + Number of Apples

From the problem statement, we know that there are 30 regular sodas, 8 diet sodas, and 41 apples. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation above:

Total Number of Bottles = 30 + 8 + 41
Total Number of Bottles = 79

So, the toko kelontong has 79 bottles in total.";
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 79 + 53 + 42 = 164 bottles. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is 79 / 164 = 0.48 or approximately 48%. Therefore, the toko kelontong has about 48% of their bottles of soda as regular soda.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 54 + 83 + 12 = 149 bottles. Since we are asked about the number of regular soda bottles, let's assume that these are the bottles with a volume of 83 botol soda biasa. Therefore, the number of regular soda bottles is 83 / 100 = 8.3 bottles. So, they have 8.3 bottles of regular soda.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 17 and out of those, 9 are regular soda bottles and the rest (10) are diet soda bottles. So, the number of diet soda bottles they have is 10. Now we need to find out how many diet soda bottles are in 10. Since there are 29 apples, each apple requires 3 bottles of diet soda (since one apple needs 3 bottles of water). Therefore, the number of diet soda bottles the store has is:  Number of diet soda bottles = Total number of bottles x Number of apples / Number of bottles per apple = 17 x 29 / 3 = 56 diet soda bottles. So, the store has 56 diet soda bottles.;
Response:  The total number of bottles of soda that Toko Kelontong has is 19 + 60 = 79 bottles. So, they have 79 bottles of soda in total.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 72 (regular) + 32 (diet) = 104 bottles.  Now, we are asked how many more bottles they have than apples. So, let's subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles: 104 - 78 = 26 more bottles than apples. Therefore, there are 26 more bottles than apples.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 36 + 54 = 90 bottles. Now we need to find out how many more bottles they have than apples. So, we divide the number of bottles by the number of apples: 90 / 36 = 2 and 1/3. Therefore, there are 2 and 1/3 more bottles than apples in the store.;
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 30 and out of those, 28 are regular soda bottles. So, the number of Diet Soda bottles they have is:  Number of Diet Soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of Regular Soda bottles  = 30 - 28  = 2 Therefore, the toko kelontong has 2 Diet Soda bottles.;
Response:  If they have 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 bottles of regular soda, then we can find out how many bottles of regular soda they have by subtracting the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles. So, if they have 79 - 4 = 75 bottles of regular soda. Therefore, they have 75 bottles of regular soda.;
"Response:  The total number of bottles of soda that the store has is equal to the sum of the number of regular soda bottles (57) plus the number of diet soda bottles (26) plus the number of light soda bottles (27). So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total Number of Bottles = Regular Soda Bottles + Diet Soda Bottles + Light Soda Bottles

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

Total Number of Bottles = 57 + 26 + 27
= 100

Therefore, the store has exactly 100 bottles of soda in total.";
Response:  The total number of bottles of soda that the store has is 81 + 60 + 60 = 201 bottles. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of regular soda they have compared to diet soda. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is 60 / (60 + 60) = 60/120 = 0.5 or  half. Therefore, the store has 50 bottles of regular soda and 150 bottles of diet soda.;
Response:  The total number of bottles of soda that the store has is 49 (biasa) + 40 (diets) = 89. Since they have 6 bottles of light soda, we can subtract this from the total number of bottles to get the number of regular and diet sodas consumed: 89 - 6 = 83. Therefore, the store consumes 83 bottles of regular and diet soda per day.;
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and 295 visitors the day before, then we can calculate the difference in visitors between these two days as follows:  Difference = 317 - 295 = 22 Visitors So, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday compared to the previous day.;
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the palace yesterday and they went there after eating something delicious, then we can assume that they visited the palace at around noon or in the afternoon when people usually have lunch or dinner. So, if we calculate the number of visitors per day based on this assumption, we get: Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days (in this case, 25 days) = 703 visitors / 25 days = 28.1 visitors per day Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the palace during the 25-day period: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days = 28.1 visitors/day x 25 days = 703 visitors Therefore, during the 25-day period, approximately 703 visitors came to the palace.;
Response:  On the previous day (yesterday), there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace. Today, there are 666 visitors. So, if we compare the number of visitors today with the number of visitors yesterday, then: Number of visitors today = 666 Visitors today / Number of visitors yesterday = 666/100 = 6.66 times more visitors than yesterday. Therefore, there are 6.66 times more visitors at Buckingham Palace today compared to yesterday.;
Response:  If 132 people visited the palace yesterday and there were 327 days before that, then we can calculate the total number of visitors as follows: Total Number of Visitors = Yesterday's Visitors x (Number of Days Before Yesterday / 327) Total Number of Visitors = 132 x (327 / 327) = 132 x 1 = 132 Therefore, 132 people visited the palace on the previous day.;

Response:  We know that there are 71 paintings in the palace and 557 visitors came to the palace yesterday. So, we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Average daily visitors = Total visitors / Number of days = 557 / 57 = 9.6 visitors per day Now, let's find out how many visitors visited the palace during the previous 57 days:  Total visitors during previous 57 days = Average daily visitors x Number of days = 9.6 visitors/day x 57 days = 543 visitors During those 57 days, the total number of visitors who visited the palace was 543.;
Response:  We know that there are 39 paintings in the palace and 661 visitors came to see them. If we assume that the number of visitors is increasing linearly from day to day (which may not be true but for simplicity let's assume so), then we can calculate the difference between the number of visitors on each day as follows: Day before - 39 = x Day after - 661 = y Where x and y are integers. Now, we want to find out how many more visitors came to the palace on the day after compared to the day before. To do this, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day: y - x = 661 - 39 = 582 So, there were 582 more visitors at the palace on the day after compared to the day before.;
Response:  We know that there were 419 visitors to the palace before the day of the meal and 103 visitors the day before that. So, in total, there were 522 visitors to the palace before the day of the meal. Now, we are told that 92 people visited the palace on the day of the meal. Therefore, the number of visitors to the palace after the meal is:  Number of visitors after the meal = Total number of visitors before the meal - Number of visitors on the day of the meal  = 522 - 92  = 430 To summarize, there were 430 visitors to the palace after the meal.;
Response:  We know that there are 512 visitors to the palace today and we want to find out how many visitors have come in the last 89 days. To do this, we can use the information provided earlier about the number of visitors per day. If 471 people visited the palace yesterday and 808 people visited the palace two days ago, then the total number of visitors over the past 89 days is:  Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday x Number of days since yesterday + Number of visitors two days ago x Number of days since two days ago  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Total visitors = 471 x 3 + 808 x 6  Total visitors = 1,553  Therefore, there were 1,553 visitors to the palace in the last 89 days.;
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to the palace on the day in question.  If we subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (191), we get 514 additional visitors.

If we divide the number of kalung (20) by the number of manik-manik Emily has (5), we get: Number of manik-manik per kalung = 20 / 5 = 4 Therefore, Emily needs 4 manik-manik to make one kalung.;
Response:  If Emily makes 26 kalung and each kalung requires 2 manik-manik, then she needs 2 x 26 = 52 manik-manik in total. So, Emily has 52 manik-manik.;
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. So, we have: Number of children who went to camp = 819058 Number of children who stayed at home = 668278 Now, we want to find out how many times more children stayed at home than those who went to camp. To do this, we divide the number of children who stayed at home (668278) by the number of children who went to camp (819058): Number of times more children stayed at home than those who went to camp = 668278 / 819058 = 0.8 or 80% Therefore, there are 80% more children who stayed at home during their summer vacation compared to those who went to camp.;
Response:  We know that there are 1,345,873 children in Lawrence County and 777,622 of them stay at home during summer vacation. So, we have to find out how many more children stay at home compared to those who go to camp. To do this, we divide the number of children who stay at home (777,622) by the total number of children in Lawrence County (1,345,873). This gives us approximately 0.59 or 59%. Therefore, about 59% of the children in Lawrence County stay at home during summer vacation while the remaining 41% (or 497,251 children) go to camp.;
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total in Lawrence County.  During summer vacation, 629424 of them went to camp and left their homes. So, the number of children who stayed at home is:  Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp  = 898051 - 629424  = 268627  Therefore, there are 268627 children who stayed at home during the summer vacation.;
Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County. During summer vacation, 274,865 children stay at home and the rest go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children go to camp. To do this, we can divide the number of children who stay at home (274,865) by the total number of children in Lawrence County (313,473). This gives us the proportion of children who go to camp:  Number of children who go to camp = Number of children who stay at home / Total number of children in Lawrence County  Number of children who go to camp = 274,865 / 313,473 ≈ 0.87 or approximately 87% of the children in Lawrence County go to camp during summer vacation.;
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children in Lawrence County who stay at home during summer vacation.  And we also know that 455682 of them go to camp. So, the number of children who don't go to camp is:  Number of children who don't go to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who go to camp = 907611 - 455682 = 451939.;
Response:  We know that 800059 children from Lawrence County went to camp and the remaining stayed at home. So, we need to find out how many children stayed at home.  To do this, we can use the total number of children in Lawrence County which is given as 828521.  Since all the children did not go to camp, there must be some who stayed at home.  Therefore, the number of children who stayed at home is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who went to camp.  So, the answer is: Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp  Number of children staying at home = 828521 - 800059  Number of children staying at home = 437662  There are 437662 children who stay at home in Lawrence County.;
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children from Lawrence County who stay at home during summer vacation. The total number of children in Lawrence County is 91676. So, we need to find out how many children go to camp among all the children in Lawrence County. To do this, we can divide the number of children who go to camp (61619) by the total number of children in Lawrence County (91676). Therefore, approximately 67% or 65804/91676 of the children in Lawrence County go to camp.;
Response:  We know that 34044 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 134867 other children stayed at home. Additionally, 424944 children from outside the area attended the camp. So, in total, how many children attended the camp?  To find out, we need to add up all these numbers: 34044 + 134867 + 424944 = 690045 children attended the camp. Therefore, there were approximately 690,000 children who attended the camp.;
Response:  We know that 610769 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 590796 children stayed at home. Additionally, 22 children from outside the area attended the camp. So, in total, there are 632987 children (610769 + 590796 + 22).;
Response:  We know that 644997 children from Lawrence County are at home and 893835 children have gone to camp. Additionally, there are 78 children from outside the area attending the camp. So, in total, there are 644997 + 893835 + 78 = 726010 children from Lawrence County who are either at home or attending the camp.;
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie must have x apples. Since Adam has 9 apples in total, we can write an equation as follows:  Apples owned by Jackie = x + 3 (since Adam owns 3 more apples than Jackie) Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:  Apples owned by Jackie = x + 3 = 9 ( since Adam has 9 apples in total) Solving for x, we get:  X = 6 (Since Jackie has 6 apples) Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.;
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has. So, the difference between Adam's total number of apples (10) and Jackie's total number of apples (2) is:  10 - 2 = 8 Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.;
"Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has:  
Jackie has 10 apples - Adam has 9 apples = 1 apple  
So, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.";
"Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has:  
Jackie has 10 - 8 = 2 more apples than Adam. So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.";
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 6 apples together. If Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie must have x apples. Since they have 4 more apples together, we can write an equation as follows:  Adam = x + 4  Now, let's solve for x:  Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:  x = 2  Therefore, Jackie has 2 apples. So, Adam has 6 + 4 = 10 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples together. Then, we are told that Adam has more than 9 apples in total. So, if Adam has x apples, then he must have at least 9 + 7 = 16 apples in total (including those with Jackie). Therefore, Adam has 16 apples in total.;
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie and together they have 12 apples. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has 12 - x apples. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, we can write an equation as follows:  x + (12 - x) = 8  Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 6  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:  x = 3  Therefore, Adam has 3 apples and Jackie has 9 apples.;
"Response:  We know that Adam has fewer apples than Jackie because he is described as having ""empat"" (four) more apples than Jackie. So if Jackie has 10 apples, then Adam must have 6 + 4 = 10 apples. Therefore, Adam has 10 apples in total.";
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has less than x apples. Since Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, we can say that Jackie has at most 89 + 11 = 90 fruit in total. Therefore, Adam must have at least 5 + 90 = 95 apples.;
"Response:  We know that Helen and her friends are preparing for Thanksgiving at Helen's house.  Helen has already made 31 kue kemarin (morning) and 270 kue pagi (morning). So far, she has made a total of 301 kue (31 + 270). Now we need to find out how many more kue Helen has made until the previous night. According to the question, ""Helen memanggang 419 kue kemarin."" Therefore, the total number of kue Helen has made is:  Total = 301 + 419 = 720 kue. So, Helen has made 720 kue until the previous night.";
Response:  We know that Helen and her friends are preparing for Thanksgiving at Helen's house.  From the information given, we can determine how many cookies each person is bringing.  If Helen is making 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 chocolate kisses today, then she must be making 484 chocolate chip cookies total (90 + 51 = 484). Therefore, the answer to the question is 484.;
Response:  We know that Helen and her friends are preparing for Thanksgiving at Helen's house.  Last night, Helen baked 527 chocolate cookies and 86 mini chocolates. Today, she is making 86 chocolate chip muffins and 554 chocolate chip cookies. So, how many chocolate cookies did Helen make in total?  To find out, we need to add up the number of cookies made last night and today: 527 + 554 = 1081 Therefore, Helen made 1081 chocolate cookies in total.;
Response:  We know that Helen and her friends are preparing for Thanksgiving at Helen's house.  Last night, Helen baked 144 chocolate cookies and 397 mini chocolates. This morning, she also made 85 mini chocolates and 403 chocolate chip cookies. So, to find out how many mini chocolates Helen made this morning, we can subtract the number of mini chocolates she made last night from the total number of chocolate cookies she made today: 85 (mini chocolates made this morning) = 403 (total number of chocolate cookies made today) - 397 (number of mini chocolates made last night) Therefore, Helen made 68 mini chocolates this morning.;
Response:  We know that Helen made 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 231 chocolate chip cookies this morning. So, altogether she made 420 chocolate chip cookies (19 + 231). Now, let's find out how many more chocolate chip cookies than kismis Helen made. The number of kismis cookies is given as 237. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows: Number of chocolate chip cookies - Number of kismis cookies = Difference between the two numbers. Substituting the values, we get: 420 - 237 = 183 difference between the two numbers. So, there are 183 more chocolate chip cookies than kismis cookies made by Helen.;
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday means the day before Thanksgiving), Helen made 197 chocolate cookies and 46 mini chocolates. Today, she is preparing for Thanksgiving at home with her friends. She baked 75 mini chocolates and 66 chocolate chip cookies this morning. So, compared to yesterday, Helen made more chocolate chip cookies today but fewer mini chocolates. Therefore, the number of chocolate cookies made by Helen yesterday is greater than the number of chocolate chip cookies made today. The difference between these two numbers can be calculated as follows:  Number of chocolate cookies made yesterday = 197 - 75 = 122 Number of chocolate chip cookies made today = 66 Now we have found out that Helen made 122 more chocolate cookies yesterday than she did today!;
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday means the day before today), Helen made 519 chocolate cookies and 300 mini chocolates. Today, she is preparing for Thanksgiving at home with her friends. She baked 280 mini chocolates and 359 chocolate chip cookies this morning. So, to find out how many more mini chocolates were made yesterday compared to today, we can subtract the number of mini chocolates made today from the number made yesterday: 519 - 280 = 239. Therefore, Helen made 239 more mini chocolates yesterday than she did today.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, we need to find out how many games Katie has more than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends.;
Response:  Katie has 91 games, her new friend has 88 games, and her old friend has 53 games. So, in total, Katie's friends have 88 + 53 = 141 games.;
Response:  Katie has 78 new games and 86 old games, so she has a total of 164 games (78 + 86).  Her friends have 48 new games, so they have a total of 48 games (48).  Therefore, together they have a total of 212 games (164 + 48).;
Response:  Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19).  Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69).  Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77).;
Response:  We know that Katie has 62 new games and her friends have 73 new games. So, together they have 62 + 73 = 135 new games. Now, we need to find out how many old games their combined collection contains. From the question, we know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games, so their total number of old games is 80 + 41 = 121. Therefore, the number of old games that Katie's friends have is 121 - 135 = -14 games.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 games and her friend has 63 games for Nintendo DS. So, we need to find out how many games Katie has besides her friend's games. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friend has from the total number of games Katie has:  Number of games Katie has besides her friend = Total number of games Katie has - Number of games her friend has  In this case, the total number of games Katie has is 57, and the number of games her friend has is 63, so: Number of games Katie has besides her friend = 57 - 63 = -6  Therefore, Katie has 6 less games than her friend.;
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96).  Now, we are asked how many games Katie has besides her friends'. Since her friends have 34 new games, let's subtract that from their total to find out how many games they have besides Katie. So, the number of games her friends have besides Katie is:  34 - 34 = 0 games. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends do!;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $60 and Jason has $19 initially. Then, after cuci (wash) his car, Jason now has $33. So, the amount of money Jason gained from washing his car is $33 - $19 = $14. Therefore, the answer is $14.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $86 and Jason has $5. So, their total amount of money is $86 + $5 = $91. Now, let's consider what happened during the weekend. We are told that Fred cleaned his car and now he has $9 instead of $86. Therefore, his new amount of money is $9 - $86 = -$77. As for Jason, since he didn't work, he still has $5. So, their combined amount of money now is $9 + $5 = $14.;
Response:  We know that Fred had $19 at first and then he got $21 after cuci mobils. So his new amount is $19 + $21 = $30. Now we know that Jason had $16 at first and now he has $69. So the difference between what Jason gained and what Fred lost is $69 - ($30 + $16) = $53. Therefore, Fred gained $53 during the weekend.;
Response:  We know that Fred had $114 initially and lost some money during the weekend. Then we know that Jason started with $22 and gained money during the weekend. Now we are told that Fred has $21 left and Jason has $78. So, to find out how much money Jason made during the weekend, we can subtract the amount of money that Fred lost from the total amount of money that Jason gained: $$ = \text { $78 - $21 = $57$ }$$ Therefore, Jason earned $57 during the weekend.;
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and Jason had $40. Then, Fred cleaned his car for $6 during the weekend and now has $115. Meanwhile, Jason delivered newspapers and earned $8, so he now has $44. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from cleaning their cars is $115 - $6 = $119.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $49 and Jason has $3. After Fred cups his car for an entire weekend, he now has $112. Therefore, the amount of money that Fred can get from cupping his car is $112 - $49 = $63. Now, let's calculate how much money Jason can get from delivering newspapers. Since Jason delivered newspapers, he gained $63 + $3 = $66. So, the total amount of money they both got from their respective activities is $66 + $63 = $129.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason had $78 and now he has $14 after selling the newspaper. So, his new amount of money is $78 + $14 = $92.  Next, we know that Fred had $78 and now he has $90 after washing his car. So, his new amount of money is $78 + $90 = $168.  Now, let's find out how much money they can get from selling the newspaper. We know that Jason sold the newspaper for $14, so he gained $14 - $78 = $-60. Similarly, Fred also sold the newspaper for $14, so he gained $14 - $78 = $-64. Therefore, the total amount of money they can get from selling the newspaper is $60 + $64 = $124.;
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 and gave away $16 in newspapers, so he now has $33 - $16 = $17. Then, he cleaned his car for $74, so he gained that amount. Therefore, at the end of the week, Fred has $17 + $74 = $91.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 initially and then he earned $111 from selling newspapers and $34 from washing cars. So, his new total amount of money is:  $47 + $111 + $34 = $282  Therefore, Fred currently has $282.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's initial weight was 71 kg. Then, after starting to run every day, she lost 20 kg. So her new weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg. Therefore, Jessie's current weight is 51 kg.;
Response:  Before Jessie started jogging, she weighed 27 kg. After she started jogging every day, she lost 101 kg. So, her original weight before starting to jog was: 27 kg - (101 kg / 2) = 134 kg. Therefore, Jessie's original weight before she started jogging was 134 kg.;
Response:  Before Jessie started jogging every day, her weight was 126 kg. After she started jogging, her weight decreased to 66 kg. So, we can calculate her original weight as follows: Original weight = Current weight / (1 - Decrease in weight) = 66 kg / (1 - (-126/66)) = 158 kg Therefore, Jessie's original weight before she started jogging was 158 kg.;
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running for 10 weeks, she lost 35 kg, which means her current weight is: 69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg So, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg.;
Response:  In week one (minggu pertama), Jessie lost 50 kg or 50/7 = 7.14 kg per day. So her weight after one week is 114 - 7.14 x 7 = 98.56 kg.  In week two (minggu kedua), she lost another 60 kg or 60/7 = 8.57 kg per day. So her current weight is 98.56 - 8.57 x 7 = 83.99 kg. Therefore, Jessie's current weight is approximately 83.99 kg.;
Response:  We know that after Jessie started jogging every day, she lost weight as follows:  In week one, she lost 62 kg and in week two, she lost 140 kg. So, her initial weight must have been:  Initial weight = Final weight - Total weight lost in week one + Total weight lost in week two  Initial weight = 9 kg - 62 kg + 140 kg  Initial weight = 75 kg Therefore, before starting to jog, Jessie weighed 75 kg.;
Response:  After one week of jogging, Jessie lost 56 kg. So her weight after one week is:  $92 \text{ kg} - 56 \text{ kg} = 36 \text{ kg}$  Therefore, Jessie's weight after one week of jogging is $36 \text{ kg}$.;
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes and 61 crocodiles in the zoo. If 64 of them are hiding, then we can deduce that the number of non-hiding snakes is equal to the total number of snakes minus the number of hidden snakes. So, the number of non-hiding snakes is:  95 - 64 = 31. Therefore, there are 31 snakes that are not hiding in the zoo.;
Response:  We know that there are 97 buaya in total at the zoo. If 40 of them are hiding, then we can deduce that the number of buaya not hiding is 97 - 40 = 57. So, there are 57 buaya not hiding at the zoo.;
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 crocodiles in the zoo. If 82 snakes and 19 crocodiles hide, then we have to subtract these numbers from the total number of animals in the zoo. So, the number of animals left hiding is:  Total number of animals = 3 + 75 = 78 Animals hidden = 82 + 19 = 101 Therefore, there are 101 crocodiles and 3 snakes not hiding in the zoo.;
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the enclosure, and we want to find out how many of them are hiding.  The number of snakes is 24, and the number of crocodiles is 51. So, if 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles are hiding, then the remaining animals that are not hiding are:  Total number of animals that are not hiding = Number of animals in the enclosure - Number of snakes hiding - Number of crocodiles hiding = 79 - 24 - 51 = 34 Therefore, there are 34 animals that are not hiding in the enclosure.;
Response:  Yesterday, there were 171 tomatoes and the farmer took 134 of them. So, today, there are left with 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes.;
Response:  We know that the farmer had 160 tomatoes initially and took 56 of them yesterday. So, the number of tomatoes left after yesterday's harvest is:  160 - 56 = 104 Now we are told that the farmer took another 41 tomatoes today. So, the number of tomatoes left after today's harvest is:  104 - 41 = 63 Therefore, there are 63 tomatoes left after both harvests.;
Response:  Yesterday (kemarin), the farmer took 154 tomatoes from his garden, so today he has 90 - 154 = 66 tomatoes left.  Now, today (hari ini), the farmer takes another 50 tomatoes, leaving him with 66 - 50 = 16 tomatoes remaining in his garden. Therefore, the farmer has taken a total of 154 + 50 = 204 tomatoes from his garden.;
Response:  If the farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden, then he must have picked 172 potatoes to leave 3 potatoes behind. So, there are 3 potatoes left after picking 172 potatoes. Now, let's calculate how many tomatoes are left. We know that the farmer picked 172 potatoes, which means he took away 172 x 0.6 = 101.2 tomatoes (since each potato takes up 0.6 tomatoes). Therefore, there are 175 - 101.2 = 73.8 tomatoes left in the garden.;
Response:  If the farmer has 177 tomatoes and he picks up 53 of them, then there are 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left in the garden. Similarly, if he has 12 potatoes and he picks up 0 of them (since we know he didn't pick any), then there are still 12 potatoes left in the garden. Therefore, the number of tomatoes left is 124, and the number of potatoes left is 12.;
"Response:  We know that the farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in total. If he picks 137 tomatoes, then we can calculate how many are left as follows:

Green tomatoes = 105 - (137 x 100/105) = 68
Red tomatoes = 71 - (137 x 100/71) = 49
So there are 68 green tomatoes and 49 red tomatoes left after the farmer picks 137 tomatoes.";
Response:  We know that John needs to cut 4 pieces of wood for his house wall. Each piece of wood requires 2 cuts of nails. So, in total, John needs 8 nail cuts (4 pieces x 2 cuts per piece).;
Response:  We know that for each large panel of wood, John needs 17 strips of adhesive. Since there are 13 large panels in total, he needs 13 x 17 = 201 strips of adhesive for the large panels alone. However, as you mentioned, some smaller panels also require adhesive. So let's assume that these smaller panels require an additional 8 strips of adhesive per panel. Therefore, the total number of strips of adhesive needed by John is 201 + (13 x 8) = 246 strips of adhesive.;
"Response:  We know that for each wall of the house, John will use 11 nails (not paku). So, to calculate how many walls there are in total, we need to divide the number of nails by the number of nails used per wall.  If each wall requires 3 nails, then the total number of walls is:

Number of nails = Total number of walls x Number of nails per wall
= 11 x 4
= 44 walls
Therefore, John needs 44 walls to cover the entire house.";
Response:  We know that for the big panels, John needs 15 pieces of glue. For each small panel, he needs 5 pieces of glue. So, to find out how many total pieces of glue John needs, we can multiply the number of big panels by the number of small panels and then add them together. In this case, there are 12 big panels and 10 small panels, so: 12 x 5 = 60 + 10 = 70 pieces of glue. Therefore, John needs 70 pieces of glue for the dining room walls.;
Response:  We know that each panel requires two pieces of adhesive tape to be attached. Therefore, we need to calculate how many pieces of adhesive tape are required for all panels. Since there will be 16 panels in total, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pieces of adhesive tape = Total number of panels x Number of pieces per panel So, the answer is 16 x 2 = 32 pieces of adhesive tape needed for John's wall.;
Response:  We know that there are 8 large wooden panels in total. Each panel requires 74 pieces of adhesive tape to ensure proper bonding. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pieces of adhesive tape needed as follows: Total number of pieces of adhesive tape = Number of panels x Required pieces per panel Total number of pieces of adhesive tape = 8 x 74 = 592 pieces of adhesive tape So, John needs 592 pieces of adhesive tape to attach all 8 large wooden panels to the wall.;
Response:  We know that there are 12 large panels and 17 small panels in total.  Each large panel requires 14 hooks for installation, so we need to calculate how many hooks are needed for all the large panels together: 12 x 14 = 168 hooks.  Similarly, each small panel requires 25 hooks for installation, so we need to calculate how many hooks are needed for all the small panels together: 17 x 25 = 425 hooks.  Therefore, in total, John needs 593 hooks (168 + 425) to hang the panels on the wall.;
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in total and each pack contains 3 pieces. So, to find out how many packets Robin has, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each packet:  Number of packets = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces in each packet  Number of packets = 42 / 3  Number of packets = 14 packets  Therefore, Robin has 14 packets of gum.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packets of rubber bands and each packet contains 23 rubber bands. So, in total, Robin has 43 x 23 = 1007 rubber bands. Now, we are told that Robin also has 8 extra rubber bands. Therefore, the total number of rubber bands that Robin has is 1007 + 8 = 1015 rubber bands.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of rubber bands. So, he has a total of 7 + 6 = 13 pieces of rubber bands. Since each piece is in a separate package, Robin must have 13 packages of rubber bands. Therefore, the answer is 13.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of rubber bands and each packet contains 4 rubber bands. So, in total, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 rubber bands.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packets of rubber bands and each packet contains 9 rubber bands. So, in total, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 rubber bands.;
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of rubber bands and each packet contains 6 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces of rubber bands owned by Robin is:  28 packets x 6 pieces/packet = 168 pieces;
Response:  If the machine can make 3 pieces per minute and makes 6 incomplete pieces altogether, then we need to calculate how long it takes for the machine to produce those 6 incomplete pieces. We know that each piece takes 1 minute to complete, so if the machine produces 3 pieces in 1 minute, it means that it takes 2 minutes to produce all 6 pieces (since 3 x 2 = 6). Therefore, the machine works for 2 minutes.;
Response:  If the machine works for 5 minutes and can produce 4 orders per minute, then it produces 4 x 5 = 20 orders in total during those 5 minutes. So, the answer is 20 orders.;
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 kaos per minute and it produced 9 kaos yesterday, then it worked for 9/3 = 3 minutes yesterday.  And if it produces 44 kaos today, then it works for 44/3 = 14 minutes today. So, the total time the machine worked yesterday and today is 3 + 14 = 17 minutes.;
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 13 pieces, and today it produced 3 pieces. So, the total number of pieces produced by the machine is: 13 + 3 = 16 pieces. Now, we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked to produce these 16 pieces. We know that the machine can produce 8 pieces per minute, so: Total time taken to produce 16 pieces = Number of pieces / Speed (in pieces/minute) = 16 / 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes to produce all those pieces.;
Response:  If the machine can produce 9 pieces yesterday and 8 pieces today, then it means that the total number of pieces produced is 9 + 8 = 17. Since the machine can make 2 pieces per minute, the total time taken to produce these 17 pieces is 17 / 2 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 8 minutes today.;
Response:  If the machine can make 3 kaos per minute today, then it made 8 kaos / 3 = 2.67 minutes of work today. So, the machine worked for approximately 2 minutes and 40 seconds (2.67 minutes) today.;
Response:  If the machine can produce 6 kaos per minute yesterday and today, then we have: Yesterday: 6 kaos/min x 12 min = 72 kaos Today: 6 kaos/min x 14 min = 96 kaos So, the total number of kaos produced by the machine is 72 + 96 = 168 kaos.;
"Response:  If the machine can produce 6 pieces per minute yesterday and today it produces 12 pieces, then we have an increase of 6 pieces per minute compared to yesterday. So, if yesterday the machine produced x Kaos, then today it will produce x + 6 Kaos. We know that x = 5 (since the machine produced 6 Kaos per minute yesterday). Therefore, the number of Kaos produced by the machine today is:  
x + 6 = 5 + 6 = 11 Kaos.";
Response:  We know that they played for 5 days and earned $165 each day. So, in total, they earned $825 (165 x 5). Therefore, their earnings per day are $825 / 5 = $165 per day.;
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money they made from playing Ring Toss game per day. According to the question, they made $144 per day. Now, let's calculate how many days they played the game during the carnival. They were at the carnival for 22 days. Therefore, the total amount of money they made from playing Ring Toss is: $144 x 22 = $3088.;
Response:  We know that in 30 days, they earned $420 from the game. In addition to this, they also won $22 from playing the game. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total amount earned = Number of days x Amount earned per day  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: Total amount earned = 30 x $420  Total amount earned = $12600  Therefore, the number of dollars made by the ring toss game per day is $12600 / 30 = $420 per day;
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 44 days, they earned $382. Then, in the remaining 10 days, they earned $374. To find out how much they earned altogether, we can add these two amounts together: $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the total amount of money they earned is $756.;
Response:  In total, they earned $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the remaining 16 days for a total of $186. So, they earned an average of $11.37 per day during the first 20 days.;
"Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 154 hours of the carnival (or 6 days), they earned $325. This means their daily earnings were:

$325 / 6 days = $54 per day

Now, let's calculate their total earnings for the remaining 57 hours of the carnival:

$54 x 57 hours = $3,098

Therefore, the total amount of money they earned during the entire duration of the carnival is:

$325 + $3,098 = $3,423

So, they earned an average of $59 per day during the entire duration of the carnival.";
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packets of candy and 4 packets of candy, then she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packets of candy in all. So, the answer is 14.;
Response:  Paket kue = 4 x 22 = 88 Paket kue Paket cokelat = 16 Total number of packets bought = 88 + 16 = 104;
Response:  Lucy bought 23 packets of candy and some other packets of candy. So far, she has 23 + x = 27 bags of candy. Here;x' represents the number of additional packets of candy that Lucy bought. Therefore, the answer is 23 + x = 27.
Response:  Firstly, Lucy bought 2 packets of kue at RM3 each, so she spent RM6 in total for those two packets. Then, she bought 12 more packets of kue at RM4 each, so she spent RM48 for those 12 packets. Therefore, the total amount that Lucy spent is RM6 + RM48 = RM54. So, the number of packets of kue that Lucy bought is 54/12 = 4.5 packets. Since we can't have a half packet of kue, the final answer is 4 packets of kue that Lucy bought.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, the total number of people in the bus now is:  Initially: 12 + New passengers: 4 = Total number of people in the bus now: 16;
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 people boarded the bus and 3 people got off. So, now there are 8 + 12 - 3 = 21 people in the bus.;
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people in the bus now is: 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 people in the bus now.;
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got on board. So, the total number of people in the train now is: 11 + 8 = 19. Therefore, there are 19 people in the train now.;
Response:  We know that there are 22 elderly people and 676 people in total. To find out how many students are present, we need to subtract the number of elders from the total number of people. So, the number of students is:  Number of students = Total number of people - Number of elders  Number of students = 676 - 22  Number of students = 654 Therefore, there are 654 students present in the program.;
Response:  Orang tua = 73 Guru = 744 Total people = Orang tua + Guru = 73 + 744 = 817;
Response:  We know that there are 174 elderly people and 521 students in this program. To find out how many students are present compared to the elderly, we need to divide the number of students by the number of elderly people. So, we can say: Number of students per elderly person = Number of students / Number of elderly people = 521 / 174 = 3.06  Therefore, there are approximately 3.06 students for every elderly person in this program.;
Response:  We know that there are 61 elderly people and 177 students in this program. If we want to find out how many people are present in the program, we need to subtract the number of elderly people from the total number of participants. So, the answer is:  Number of people present = Total number of participants - Number of elderly people = 177 - 61 = 116 people.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that the depth of this cave is 919 feet (kaki). Then, they need to travel a distance of 1307 feet (kaki) from the end of the cave. So, we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows: Distance = End point - Starting Point = 1307 ft - 919 ft = 488 ft Therefore, they will have to travel 488 feet further from the end of the cave.;
Response:  Firstly, we know that they are currently at an altitude of 1218 feet (kaki) and want to reach an altitude of 849 feet. To calculate how far they have traveled, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. Since they are traveling at a constant speed of 17 feet per minute, it will take them minutes to cover this distance. Therefore, the total distance traveled is equal to the product of their speed and the time taken to cover the distance. So, the answer is feet.;
Response:  If they are currently at 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet long, then they have already traveled half of the length of the cave (762 - 659 = 133 feet). To find out how far they need to go until they reach the end of the cave, we can divide the total length of the cave by two (762 feet / 2 = 381 feet). So, they still need to travel an additional 381 feet until they reach the end of the cave.;
Response:  We know that Paige had 8 goldfish in the beginning and she fed them for 3 days. On the third day, she found out that there were only 6 goldfish left in the tank. So, we can conclude that 2 goldfish (or 2/8) have disappeared from the tank during those 3 days. Now, let's consider the situation with the cat. The cat has been eating fish in the tank every day, but it doesn't eat all of them. Let's assume that the cat eats half of what remains after the disappearance of 2 goldfish (i.e., 2/8). Therefore, the number of remaining goldfish is now 8 - 2 = 6. And since the cat eats half of these remaining fish every day, the total number of goldfish that the cat eats per day is 6 / 2 = 3. So, the answer to the question is 3.;
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 goldfish and 12 koi in the pond. If the cat likes to eat them, then we can assume that some of the fish have been eaten. So, let's say x number of fish have been eaten (where x is an unknown variable). Now, we are left with 15 fish remaining in the pond. Therefore, the total number of fish that were initially present in the pond minus the number of fish that were eaten = 15. Mathematically, this can be represented as:  Initially, there were 7 goldfish + 12 koi = 29 fish Total number of fish eaten by the cat = x Number of fish remaining in the pond = 15 Substituting the values given in the question, we get: 29 - x = 15 Solving for x, we get: x = 14 So, out of the initial 29 fish, 14 were eaten by the cat, leaving 15 fish remaining in the pond.;
Response:  If Paige has 16 goldfish and 71 koi in her pond, that means she had a total of 87 fish initially (16 + 71 = 87). Now, if a cat is eating them, we can assume that 2 fish are being eaten per day (based on the information given in the question). So, after 2 days, Paige will have 85 fish left (87 - 2 x 2 = 85). After another 3 days, Paige will have 83 fish left (85 - 2 x 3 = 83), and so on. Therefore, the number of fish that went missing is equal to the difference between the initial number of fish and the final number of fish, which is 87 - 85 = 2.;
Response:  We know that 15 fish were put in the pond and 5 of them were eaten by the cat. So, the number of fish left in the pond is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 fish remaining in the pond.;
Response:  Initially, Chef had 43 apples and used some of them to make pies. After making pies, he was left with 2 apples. So, the number of apples Chef initially had is 43.;
Response:  We know that initially, the chef had 58 apples and after making some pie, he used 35 of them. So, the number of apples left with the chef is: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples remaining with the chef.;
"Response:  We know that initially, the chef had 40 apples and 54 pears. After making some pies, he has 39 remaining apples. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of apples used = Number of apples remaining - Initial number of apples
= 39 - 40
= -1

So, the chef used 1 apple to make the pies.";
Response:  If Adam can put 11 action figures in each shelf, and there are 4 shelves in his room, then the total number of action figures he can put in his room is:  Number of shelves x Number of action figures per shelf = 4 x 11 = 44 action figures So, the total number of action figures that Adam can put in his room is 44.;
Response:  If Adam can fit 10 action figures in each shelf, and each shelf can hold 8 action figures, then we need to calculate how many shelves are needed to accommodate all 100 action figures.  We know that there are 10 shelves in total (4 walls x 2 shelves per wall = 10 shelves). So, if Adam wants to put all 100 action figures in his room, he will need 9 extra shelves (100 - 10 = 9) to store them all. Therefore, there are 9 additional shelves needed to accommodate all 100 action figures in Adam's room.;
Response:  If Adam can fit 8 action figures in each of the 4 shelves (racks) in his room, then he can fit a total of 8 x 4 = 32 action figures in all 4 shelves combined. Similarly, if he can fit 10 drawers in each of the 4 shelves, then he can fit a total of 10 x 4 = 40 drawers in all 4 shelves combined. Therefore, the total number of items that Adam can fit in his room is 32 + 40 = 72 items.;
"Response:  If there are 544 pots of flowers in total and each pot has 32 flowers inside, then we have:

Total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers per pot
= 544 x 32
= 17,696 flowers
Therefore, there are 17,696 flowers in all.";
Response:  We know that each pot has 53 bungs and 181 sticks inside it. So, if we have $A$ pots, then the total number of bungs will be $A \times 53$, and the total number of sticks will be $A \times 181$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{A \times 53 + A \times 181}$ bungs and sticks in all the pots together.;
Response:  We know that each pot has 71 bungs and there are 4 pots in total. So, the number of bungs in all the pots is:  Number of bungs in one pot x Number of pots = 71 x 4 = 284 bungs. Therefore, there are 284 bungs in all the pots combined.;
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 bungs inside it. So, if we have x pots, then there are 40x bungs in total. Since there are 400 bungs in total, we can set up the equation: 40x = 400. Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 40 to solve for x: x = 10. Therefore, there are 10 pots in total.;
"Response:  We know that Ada has 4502 Skittles and Steven has 4276 wipes. If we divide them into groups of 154 each, then the number of groups will be:

Number of groups = Total number of Skittles / Number of Skittles per group
= 4502 / 154
= 29

So there are 29 groups of Skittles in total.";
Response:  We know that Ada has 3941 Skittles and Steven has 4950 penghapus. To divide these into groups of 495 each, we need to find out how many groups we can make with this number.  Solution:  We can create 495 groups if we divide both numbers as follows: 3941 / 495 = 7 Groups 4950 / 495 = 10 Groups So, there are 7 + 10 = 17 groups in total.;
Response:  We know that Steven has 896 Skittles in total and he wants to divide them into groups of 8 or more. So we need to find out how many groups of Skittles he can make with 8 or more Skittles each. To do this, we will use division.  Division is when you divide one number by another to get a result. In this case, we are dividing 896 (the total number of Skittles) by 8 (the number of Skittles per group).  So, we divide 896 by 8: 896 / 8 = 112. Therefore, Steven can make 112 groups of Skittles with 8 or more Skittles each.;
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in this school.;
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total Number of Students = Number of Classes x Number of Students per Class Total Number of Students = 304 x 75 Total Number of Students = 22,900 students. Therefore, there are approximately 22,900 students in this school.;
