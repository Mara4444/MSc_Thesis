Response:  Julia played tag with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. So, we can write this as:  Julia played tag with x children on Monday and y children on Tuesday. Now, we need to find out how many more children Julia played tag with on Monday than on Tuesday. We know that x - y = 8 (since there are 8 fewer children she played tag with on Tuesday). Solving for x, we get: x = 26 (since 26 is the difference between 18 and 10). Therefore, Julia played tag with 26 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  In Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played tag with 11 children.  In Tuesday (utorak), she played tag with 12 children. So, we can say that in Tuesday, Julia played tag with more children than in Monday. The difference between these two numbers is: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Julia played tag with 1 more child in Tuesday than in Monday.
Response:  Julia played tag with 5 children on Monday and then played with some other kids in Tuesday. So, she played with a total of 10 children (5 + 5). Therefore, Julia played tag with 10 children in total.
Response:  Julia played tag with some kids on Monday and with 14 kids on Tuesday. So, she played tag with a total of 16 kids (Monday + Tuesday). Therefore, Julia played tag with 16 kids in total.
Response:  If Julia played tag with 16 children on Monday and more than 12 children on Tuesday, then she must have played tag with at least 4 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday. So, if Jula played tag with 12 children on Tuesday, then she must have played tag with 16 + 12 = 28 children in total.
Response:  If Julia played tag with 14 children on Tuesday and then played with 8 more children on Wednesday, that means she played with a total of 22 children (14 + 8). So, Julia played tag with 22 children in total between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Response:  Julia played with 17 children on Monday, 15 children on Tuesday, and 2 children on Wednesday. So in total, she played with 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So far, she has played with 33 children (15 + 18). Now, we are told that she played with 97 children on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played with is: 33 + 97 = 120 children.
Response:  In Monday, Julia played with 5 children.  In Tuesday, she played with 9 children. So, in total, Julia played with 5 + 9 = 14 children.
Response:  Julia played with 2 kids in Monday and 14 kids in Tuesday. So she played with 16 kids in total (Monday + Tuesday). In Wednesday, she played with 16 kids again. Therefore, Julia played with 32 kids in total (Wednesday + Monday + Tuesday).
Response:  Julia played with 9 children on Monday and 7 children on Tuesday. So far, we have 9 + 7 = 16 children she played with in total. Now, let's find out how many more children she played with on Saturday than on Monday: Number of children Julia played with on Saturday - Number of children she played with on Monday = 96 - 16 = 80 Therefore, Julia played with 80 more children on Saturday than she did on Monday.
Response:  Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 2 children on Tuesday. So far, we have 16 children in total. Then she played with 8 more children on Wednesday. Therefore, the final number of children Julia played with is: 16 + 8 = 24.
Response:  Julia played with 8 children on Monday, 11 children on Tuesday, and 9 children on Wednesday. So, we have three sets of data: (Monday), (Tuesday), and (Wednesday). Now, let's compare these sets:  Set (Monday): 8 children Set (Tuesday): 11 children Set (Wednesday): 9 children From this comparison, we can see that Julia played with more children on Tuesday than on either Monday or Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More children were played with in Tuesday than in any other day.
Response:  Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. She also played with 7 children on Wednesday. So, in total, Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 7 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. In total, she played with 23 children.
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday (utorak), she played with 13 children. On Wednesday (srijeda), she played cards with 20 children. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 children during those three days.
"Response:  Julia played tag with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. In total, she spent 34 hours playing tag with them both days combined. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children = Total time / Time per child We know that Julia spent 34 hours playing tag in total, so let's substitute this value into our equation: Number of children = 34 hours / x hours Where ""x"" is the time Julia spent playing tag with each child. Since Julia played tag for 2 hours with each child (since there are 15 children in total), we can plug this value into our equation: Number of children = 34 hours / 2 hours/child = 17 children Therefore, Julia played tag with 17 children in total."
Response:  Julia played tag with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. In total, she spent 38 hours playing with them both days combined. So, to find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:  38 - 18 = 20 Therefore, Julia played with 20 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  In Tuesday (ponedjeljak), Julia played tag with 6 children.  In Thursday (utorak), she played tag with 5 children. So, in Pon
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. She played with 4 kids on Monday and some other kids on Tuesday. So, she played with x kids on Tuesday. Since there are only two days of the week given (Monday and Tuesday), we can conclude that x = 2. Therefore, Julia played with 2 kids on Tuesday.
Response:  Julia played with 4 kids in Wednesday and 6 kids in Monday. So, she played with more kids in Monday than in Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of kids Julia played with in Monday and Wednesday is:  6 - 4 = 2
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 25 pieces of candy so far and he started with 43 pieces in total, then we can calculate how many pieces he has left as follows: Number of pieces remaining = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces eaten So, in this case, the number of pieces remaining is: Number of pieces remaining = 43 - 25 = 18 pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby has 18 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 28 comics of bubble gum and then he ate another 42, that means he has eaten in total 28 + 42 = 70 comics of bubble gum.  However, we are also given that he has eaten 63 pieces of chocolate. So, if he had eaten only bubble gum, he would have eaten 70 - 63 = 7 comics of bubble gum. But since he ate both bubble gum and chocolate, let's subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total number of comics he ate: 70 - 63 = 7. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 7 comics of bubble gum.
Response:  Bobby has already eaten 33 pieces of candy and then he ate another 4 pieces. So, in total, he has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Additionally, he has also eaten 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the final answer is:  Bobby has eaten 37 pieces of candy and 14 pieces of chocolate.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 74 pieces of candy. Then, he ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the difference between the number of candies and chocolates that Bobby ate is:  74 - 16 = 58 pieces of candy. So, Bobby has eaten more pieces of candy than chocolate.
Response:  Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces. Then, he ate another 18 pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 52 pieces of candy (20 + 34 + 18 = 52).
Response:  Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 pieces of bubble gum. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 remaining pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, there are now 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left. Since each piece of candy contains sugar, we can conclude that there is still 25 x 0.25 = 6.25 grams of sugar left.
"Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate 3 pieces (he ate ""par slatki≈°a""). So now he has 22 - 3 = 19 pieces of candy left. Then he ate another 5 pieces (so he has 19 - 5 = 14 pieces of candy left). Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 3 + 5 = 8 pieces of candy."
Response:  If Bobby had 19 pieces of candy and he ate two pieces, then he has 17 remaining pieces of candy. To find out how much sugar is left in those 17 pieces of candy, we need to know how much sugar each piece of candy contains. Let's assume that each piece of candy contains 5 grams of sugar. Therefore, if Bobby has 17 pieces of candy left, then he has a total of 17 x 5 = 85 grams of sugar left. So, there are 85 grams of sugar left.
Response:  If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate 2 pieces, then he has 32 - 2 = 30 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby pojeo 2 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby had 36 pieces of candy initially. He already ate 17 pieces, so he has 36 - 17 = 19 pieces left. Then, he ate another 15 pieces, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 pieces left. Therefore, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 30 pieces of candy and he ate 23 pieces, then he has 7 pieces left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  If Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake and Jake gave 3 balloons in the park, then we can say that Alan had more balloons than Jake in the park. So, the difference between the number of balloons given by Alan and Jake is equal to the number of balloons that Alan had in the park minus the number of balloons that Jake had in the park.  Therefore, the answer is:  $Alan$ had $\boxed{5 - 3 = 2}$ more balloons than $Jake$ in the park.
Response:  Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake and Jake gave 3 balloons in the park. So, if we subtract the number of balloons that Alan gave from the total number of balloons given by both Alan and Jake, we get:  Number of balloons Jake had = Total number of balloons - Number of balloons Alan gave  Number of balloons Jake had = 3 + 2 = 5  Therefore, Jake had 5 more balloons than Alan in the park.
Response:  If Alan has donated 3 balloons to the park and he donated 2 of them, then Jake must have donated 1 balloon to the park. Therefore, the correct answer is: Jake donated 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  If D≈æejson has brought 6 balloons to the park and Jack has brought 4 more than the number of balloons that Alan brought, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of balloons brought by Jack = Number of balloons brought by Alan + 4  Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:  Number of balloons brought by Jack = 6 (balloons brought by D≈æejson) + 4  Using basic arithmetic operations, we get:  Number of balloons brought by Jack = 10  Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  If Alan gave 5 balloons to the park and Jack gave 6 more than what Alan gave, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of balloons given by Jack = Number of balloons given by Alan + 6 ( since Jack gave 6 more than Alan) So, if Alan gave 5 balloons, then number of balloons given by Jack is :  Number of balloons given by Jack = 5 + 6 = 11 Therefore, Jack gave 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan gave 3 balloons to Jake and then bought 2 more in the park. So, the total number of balloons given or purchased by Alan is 3 + 2 = 5. Similarly, Jake received 5 balloons from Alan and later bought 5 more in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons possessed by both Alan and Jake in the park is 5 + 5 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake in the park. So, there were 2 + 2 = 4 balloons from Alan in the park. Then, Alan bought 3 more balloons in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan had in the park was 4 + 3 = 7 balloons. Since Jake already had 4 balloons, the total number of balloons in the park was 7 (Alan) + 4 (Jake) = 11 balloons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alan gave 2 balloons to Jake and then he bought 3 more in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Alan had is 2 + 3 = 5. Now, we also know that Jake had 6 balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of balloons that Jake had and the number of balloons that Alan had is: 6 - 5 = 1. So, Jake had one more balloon than Alan in the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake. Then, he bought 3 more balloons in the park. So, the total number of balloons that Alan brought into the park is: 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
"Response: 
Alan gave 6 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 3 more in the park. So, at first, Jake had 6 + 3 = 9 balloons. Now, let's compare this number with how many balloons Alan had. According to the question, Alan had 6 balloons more than Jake. Therefore, if Jake had 9 balloons, Alan had 9 + 6 = 15 balloons.  So, the correct answer is 15."
"Response: 
Alan gave 6 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 4 more in the park. So, at first, Jake had 3 + 4 = 7 balloons. Now we know that Alan had 6 - 7 = -1 balloon less than Jake in the park. Therefore, Jake had more balloons than Alan in the park. The correct answer is: Jake had 7 balloons, while Alan had -1 balloon."
"Response: 
Alan gave 5 balloons to Jake and then Jake bought 3 more in the park. So, if we add up all the balloons that Jake had at any given time during this scenario, we get: 
Jake started with 5 + 3 = 8 balloons. Therefore, the correct answer is 8."
Response:  We know that Alan gave 3 balloons and 20 pencils to the park, so he had 3 + 20 = 23 items in the park. Similarly, we know that Jake gave 5 balloons and 59 pencils to the park, so he had 5 + 59 = 64 items in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan and Jake had in the park is 23 + 64 = 87 balloons.
Response:  We know that Alan gave 7 balloons and 5 pencils to Jake in the park. Then, we are told that Jake gave 6 balloons and 4 pencils back to Alan in the park. So, if they had an equal number of pencils before (i.e., both had 5), then after exchanging gifts, Alan would have 12 pencils (7 + 5) while Jake would have 9 pencils (6 + 4). Therefore, the final answer is:  Alan has 12 pencils, and Jake has 9 pencils.
Response:  If Alan gave 5 balloons and Jake gave 1 balloon, then together they gave 5 + 1 = 6 balloons to the park. So, Jake donated 6 - 5 = 1 balloon in the park.
Response:  If Alan gave 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more, he has a total of 5 balloons at the park (2 + 3 = 5).  Now, if Jack also brought 6 balloons to the park, that means Jack had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Alan at the park. So, Jack had 1 more balloon than Alan at the park.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 2 hours per day studying Chinese.  To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages.  So, if he spends 6 x 6 = 36 hours per day studying English and 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day studying Chinese, then he spends 36 - 4 = 32 hours more per day studying English than Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 7 hours per day studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends studying English from the number of hours he spends studying Chinese.
So, if he spends 6 hours/day studying English, that means he spends 42 hours (6 x 7) studying Chinese in one week. Therefore, he spends 10 more hours studying Chinese than English in one week."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and additional several hours learning Chinese every day, then he spends total of x hours learning Chinese per day. Since he spends overall 4 hours learning both languages each day, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 3 = 4... (1)
Now, let's solve for x in this equation. We know that x is the number of hours Ryan spends learning Chinese per day. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation gives us:
x = 4 - 3... (2)
Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour learning Chinese per day."
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours studying English and x hours studying Chinese per day, then he spends total of 7x hours studying both languages together.  If he increases his time spent studying English by 2 hours per day, then he will spend total of 7x + 4 hours studying both languages together. So, if he spends more time studying English than Chinese, it means that (7x + 4) > x. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours he spends studying English and Chinese is at least 3 hours.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese and additional several hours studying English, then he spends more time studying English than Chinese.  So if he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese, that means he spends 7 hours (5 + 2) studying English and 3 hours studying Chinese.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for 5 days in total, how many hours will he spend learning each language altogether?
To find out, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends learning each language per day by the number of days he learns that language. So, for English:
6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours (learning English)
And for Chinese:
7 hours/day x 5 days = 35 hours (learning Chinese)
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 30 + 35 = 65 hours learning both languages together over 5 days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese, then he spends a total of:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours/week studying English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours/week studying Chinese

So in one week, Ryan spends a total of:

12 hours/week + 10 hours/week = 22 hours/week studying both languages combined."
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning Chinese and he does it for 6 days in total, then he will spend a total of: 4 x 6 = 24 hours learning Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese for 86 days, then he will have spent a total of:

Total time spent learning English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours
Total time spent learning Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours
In total, Ryan has spent 352 + 504 = 856 hours studying both languages during this period."
"Response: 
Ryan provodi 6 hours per day studying English, which means he spends 6 x 7 = 42 hours per week studying English. 
He also spends 3 hours per week studying Spanish. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 42 + 3 = 45 hours per week studying languages."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours per day studying English for 3 hours, Chinese for 2 hours, and Spanish for 58 hours. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying both languages.
So, the difference is: 6 - 2 = 4 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours more studying English than Chinese."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours studying English per day, which means he studies for 14 hours (7 x 2).  He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish per day, so in total, he spends 18 hours (14 + 4) studying languages per day.  Therefore, Ryan spends more time studying English than Spanish."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 5 hours learning English every day and 4 hours learning Spanish. So he spends in total 9 hours (5 + 4) per day studying languages.  Now we need to find out how many more hours does he spend learning Chinese than Spanish. To do this, we divide the number of hours he spends learning Chinese by the number of hours he spends learning Spanish.  We know that Ryan learns Chinese for 2 hours per day, so if we divide 2 by 4, we get 0.5 or half an hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 0.5 hours more learning Chinese than Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours learning English and Chinese every day, then he spends 3 + 3 = 6 hours learning both languages together.  Therefore, if he spends 2 hours learning English each day, he spends 2/6 = 1/3 of his time learning Chinese. So, he spends 1/3 x 3 = 1 hour learning Chinese per day.
Response:  Day 1: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 9 hours (4 + 5). Day 2: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 9 hours (4 + 5). And so on... Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 9 hours per day learning both languages combined.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 containers of canned food for recycling. The next day, she found an additional 7 containers of canned food. So, in total, she had 8 + 7 = 15 containers of canned food to recycle.
Response:  On Monday, she collected 7 cans. The next day, she found an additional 12 cans. So, in total, she had 7 + 12 = 19 cans.
Response:  If Tiffany collected cans for recycling and had 4 cans on Monday, then she must have found an additional 2 cans on Tuesday (since there are now 6 cans in total). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Tiffany collected cans for recycling and had bags of them on Monday, then she must have had x bags of cans on Monday. Since she found 4 more cans on Tuesday, we know that the total number of cans she had is equal to x + 4. Therefore, the value of x is 8. So, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans on Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany collected 10 cans of food for recycling on Monday and found 3 more cans on Tuesday, then she had a total of 10 + 3 = 13 cans of food on Tuesday.  Therefore, her total collection was 13 cans.
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Tiffany collected 8 cans for recycling. If she found 10 more cans on Tuesday and 4 more cans on Wednesday, then we can write an equation based on these numbers:  Number of cans = 8 + 10 + 4 = 22 cans. Therefore, Tiffany found 22 cans after Monday.
Response:  If Tiffany collected 3 vreƒáice of cans on Monday and found 7 more vreƒáica of cans on Tuesday, then she has in total 3 + 7 = 10 vreƒáica of cans. Additionally, if she found 44 vreƒáice of bottles, that means there are 44/10 = 4.4 vreƒáice of bottles for each vreƒáicu of cans. So, the total number of vreƒáica of cans is 10 x 4.4 = 44 vreƒáice of cans.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red peppers and 16 green peppers in the bag. To find out how many more red peppers there are than green peppers, we can subtract the number of green peppers from the total number of peppers: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red pepper in the bag than green peppers.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red peppers and 11 green peppers in the bag. To find out how many more green peppers than red peppers there are, we can subtract the number of red peppers from the total number of peppers: 11 - 5 = 6. Therefore, there are 6 more green peppers than red peppers in the bag.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 red beans and ""jo≈° malo"" (meaning ""a little more"") green beans in the bag. So, let's assume that there are 5 more green beans in the bag. Therefore, the total number of beans in the bag is:  Red beans = 10 + Green beans = 5 + 5 = 20 beans. Since we want to find out how many green beans are in the bag, we can divide the total number of beans by the number of red beans: Number of green beans = Total beans / Red beans = 20 / 10 = 2 green beans."
Response:  We have 3 red berries and 5 green berries in the bag initially. If there are now 10 more green berries than red berries in the bag, then we must have gotten 7 additional green berries (since there were already 5). So, now we have 12 green berries (3 + 5 + 7) and still 3 red berries in the bag. Therefore, the number of green berries is 12, and the number of red berries is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red beans, so we can write down 7 as x. Then, we have 15 yellow beans, which means we can write down 15 as y. Finally, we have 8 green beans, which gives us 8 as z. Now, let's add up all these numbers to find out how many beans are in the basket: 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 So, there are 30 beans in the basket!
Response:  We have 71 yellow breskvic and 8 green ones in total. Now we need to find out how many more green than red there are. So, if we subtract the number of red from the number of green, we get: Number of green - Number of red = 8 - 71 = -63. Therefore, there are 63 fewer green breskvic than red in the co≈üarƒ±.
Response:  We have 2 red beans and 6 yellow beans in a basket. If we add that to the number of green beans (which is already given as 14), then we get a total of 2 + 6 + 14 = 22 beans in the basket. Since there are more green beans than yellow beans, the answer is 14 - 6 = 8 green beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red peppers in total and 11 yellow ones. So, we can say that the number of red peppers is greater than or equal to the number of yellow peppers (since they have the same denominator). Therefore, the number of red peppers must be at least 11 + 1 = 12. Since there are 12 green peppers as well, the total number of red peppers cannot exceed this value. Hence, the correct answer is: There are between 12 and 13 red peppers in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red beans and 16 green beans in the basket. If we divide the number of red beans by 2, we get 3 red beans per row. Similarly, if we divide the number of green beans by 2, we get 8 green beans per row. Therefore, the total number of red beans in one row is 3 x 9 = 27, and the total number of green beans in one row is 8 x 9 = 72. Since there are 9 rows in the basket, the total number of red beans in the basket is 27 x 9 = 243, and the total number of green beans in the basket is 72 x 9 = 658. So, there are 243 red beans and 658 green beans in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red peppers in total and 14 yellow ones. So, we can say that the number of red peppers is equal to the number of yellow peppers plus 4 (since there are 4 more red than yellow). Therefore, the number of red peppers in the basket is: 18 = 14 + 4.  So, there are 4 additional red peppers in the basket compared to the number of yellow peppers.
Response:  We have 5 red beans and we need to find out how many green and yellow ones are in the basket. So, if there are 5 red beans, then there must be 9 (5 + 4) other beans that are not red. Therefore, there will be 3 green beans and 2 yellow beans in the basket. So, the answer is: Zeleni = 3, ≈Ωuti = 2.
Response:  We have 65 ko≈°ara and each ko≈°ara has 7 red beans and 3 green beans. So, we can calculate the total number of beans in one ko≈°ara as follows: Total number of red beans = 7 x 65 = 455Total number of green beans = 3 x 65 = 195Now, let's find out how many beans are there in each ko≈°ara: Number of beans per ko≈°ara = Total number of beans / Number of ko≈°ara = 455/65 = 7So, there are 7 beans in each ko≈°ara.
Response:  We know that there are 11 ko≈°ara and each ko≈°ara has 10 red beans and 18 green beans. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of red beans = 10 x 11 = 110 Number of green beans = 18 x 11 = 208 Therefore, there are 110 red beans and 208 green beans in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 ko≈°ara and each ko≈°ara has 16 red berries. Therefore, the total number of red berries is:

16 x 6 = 96
So, there are 96 red berries in total."
Response:  We have 7 ko≈°ara and each ko≈°ara has 10 red beans and 2 green beans. So, in total we have 7 x 10 = 70 red beans and 7 x 2 = 14 green beans. Therefore, there are 14 green beans in all of the ko≈°aras combined.
Response:  We know that there are 7 total brussels sprouts in all of the bags. Since each bag has either 4 red or 3 green Brussels sprouts, we can write an equation based on this information:  Total number of Brussels sprouts = Number of red Brussels sprouts + Number of green Brussels sprouts  In this case, the number of red and green Brussels sprouts is given as follows:  Number of red Brussels sprouts = 4 x (number of bags with red Brussels sprouts)  Number of green Brussels sprouts = 3 x (number of bags with green Brussels sprouts)  Now we need to find out how many bags have red or green Brussels sprouts. From the question, we know that some bags contain only red Brussels sprouts, while others contain only green Brussels sprouts. So let's use two separate equations to represent these cases:  For bags containing only red Brussels sprouts: Number of red Brussels sprouts = Number of bags with red Brussels sprouts x 4  For bags containing only green Brussels sprouts: Number of green Brussels sprouts = Number of bags with green Brussels sprouts x 3  Now we can substitute these equations into our original equation for the total number of Brussels sprouts:  Total number of Brussels sprouts = (Number of bags with red Brussels sprouts x 4) + (Number of bags with green Brussels sprouts x 3)  Simplifying this equation gives us:  Total number of Brussels sprouts = 16  Therefore, there are 16 bags of Brussels sprouts in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4 red beans in each of two baskets (ko≈°arice). So, altogether we have 4 + 4 = 8 red beans. Now, let's find out how many green beans there are in total. Since there are some green beans left over after dividing them equally among the two baskets, we can assume that there are as many green beans in one basket as there are in the other. Therefore, if there are x green beans in one basket, then there are also x green beans in the other basket. Thus, the number of green beans in each basket is equal to half of the total number of beans in both baskets. That means that the number of green beans in each basket is 8/2 = 4. So, there are 4 green beans in each basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 breskvica in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we subtract the number of red breskvica from the total number of breskvica, we will get the number of green ones. Therefore, the number of green breskvica is equal to:

16 - 13 = 3
So, there are 3 green breskvica in the coarse."
Response:  We know that each korpa (container) has 19 red and 4 green beans. So, if we have 15 such containers, then the total number of beans is:  Number of red beans = 19 x 15 = 285 Number of green beans = 4 x 15 = 60 Therefore, there are 285 red beans and 60 green beans in total.
Response:  If there are 10 red beans equally distributed in some containers and each container has 4 red beans, then the total number of red beans is 10 x 4 = 40.  Now, if there are 6 green beans for every 4 red beans, then the total number of green beans is 6 x (40/4) = 240. Therefore, there are 240 green beans in total.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green peppers and 3 red peppers in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation: 6G + 3R = 60Y + 2C where G represents green peppers, R represents red peppers, Y represents yellow peppers (there aren't any), and C represents total number of peppers. Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into the equation: 6G + 3R = 60≈Ω + 2C 6(6) + 3(3) = 60(6) + 2(7) Substituting the value for each color: 36 + 9 = 42 + 14 50 = 56 Therefore, there are more than 50 green peppers in the basket.
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures on his shelf initially. He later added more action figures to the same shelf. So, in total, he has 8 action figures on the shelf now. Therefore, Jerry added 4 + 4 = 8 new action figures to the shelf.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 10 action figures on his shelf now. Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially (since he started with 3 and then added 7).
Response:  Jerry had 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added another 6 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are now 4 + 6 = 10 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 12 (5 + 7) action figures on the shelf. Now, let's compare it with the number of books. There were initially 9 books, and later, Jerry added more books, but we don't know how many exactly. Therefore, the final number of books is still 9. So, the ratio of action figures to books is 12:9 = 3:2.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, initially, there were 2 + 10 = 12 items on the shelf. After adding more action figures, the total number of items on the shelf became 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 items (action figures and books) on Jerry's shelf now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 10 books to the shelf. So, in total, there are: 8 + 9 = 17 items on the shelf initially. Then, Jerry added 10 more books, making the total number of items on the shelf now: 17 + 10 = 27 items. Therefore, there were 27 books on Jerry's shelf at the end.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, initially there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. After adding 4 more books, the total number of items on the shelf became 9 + 4 = 13. Therefore, there were more than 10 (i.e., 13 - 7) action figures on the shelf than the number of books.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, in total, there were 14 items (5 action figures + 2 books + 9 new books) on Jerry's shelf. Therefore, the number of books more than action figures was 14 - 5 = 9.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 4 new ones and removed 5 old ones. So, we need to find out how many action figures are left after these operations.  We know that Jerry started with 8 action figures, then he added 4 more, so now he has 12 (8 + 4) action figures in total. But then he removed 5 old ones, leaving him with 7 action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the final number of action figures on Jerry's shelf is 7.
Response:  Jerry had 3 action figures on his desk initially. Later, he added 4 more action figures and removed some of the old ones. So, if he has 6 action figures on the desk now, that means he removed 3 - 6 = -3 action figures from the desk. Therefore, Jerry skinned -3 action figures off the desk.
Response:  Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf initially. He added 5 new action figures to the shelf later. To find out how many action figures he added in total, we can subtract the number of old action figures (7) from the total number of action figures now (12). So, Jerry added 5 new action figures to the shelf.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures and removed 7 old ones. If he now has 10 action figures on his shelf, then we can deduce that he had 3 action figures on his shelf initially (since he added 2 new ones and removed 7 old ones). So, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf initially.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures on his shelf. Now, let's count how many books are on the shelf with the action figures. According to the question, there are 10 books on the shelf. Therefore, for every book on the shelf, there are 16 - 10 = 6 action figures. So, the number of action figures is greater than the number of books on the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another 2 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 5 (books + action figures) objects on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures was greater than the number of books by 5 - 3 = 2.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added another 2 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that two birds were already sitting on the fence and then more birds came. So, in total, there are now $6$ birds on the fence. Therefore, if we subtract the number of birds that were initially sitting on the fence (which is $2$), we get the total number of new birds that arrived ($4$).
Response:  At first, there was one bird on the fence (Na ogradi je bilo ptica). Then, four more birds came to join it (Do≈°le su jo≈° 4 ptice da im se pridru≈æe). So, in total, there are now 5 birds on the fence (Ako je na ogradi sada ukupno 5 ptica). Therefore, the answer is 1 + 4 = 5.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 pigeons sitting on the fence. Then, another 6 pigeons came to join them. So, in total, we have 10 pigeons sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three storks and two turtles sitting on the fence initially. Then, five birds join them. So, in total, we have: 3 + 2 = 5 animals sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 5 birds and 2 turtles sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three storks and four crows sitting on the fence initially. Two more birds join them later. So, in total, we have: Three storks + Four crows = Seven birds (including the two new birds) Sedeti on the fence. Therefore, there are seven birds sitting on the fence after the additional two birds join them.
Response:  We have two birds and six arrows initially. Then three more birds join them. So, in total we have 2 + 3 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count the number of arrows. There are 6 arrows initially, plus the additional 3 birds that joined later, so there are 6 + 3 = 9 arrows in total. Therefore, there are more arrows (9) than birds (5) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have four birds and six fences. Two storks join them. So, we need to find out how many storks are there in total. To do this, we can divide the number of birds (4) by the number of fences (6), which gives us 0.67 or approximately 3/5. Therefore, there is one stork sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three trips and four storks sitting on the fence. If six more storks join them, then we have: 3 x 3 = 9 storks + 4 = 13 birds or animals sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 13 birds or animals sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  We have six birds and three storks sitting on the fence initially. Two more storks join them later, so now we have six birds and five storks (including the two new ones). Therefore, there are more bird than storks sitting on the fence. The correct answer is: 6 - 5 = 1
Response:  We have four birds and three storks sitting on the fence initially. If six more storks join them, then we will have: Birds - 4 Storks - 3 + 6 = 9 storks Total number of storks = 9. So, there are nine storks sitting on the fence after six additional storks joined the initial group of three.
Response:  We have 6 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, another 4 birds join them, making it 10 birds in total. Finally, 8 crows join them, bringing the total number of birds to 18. So, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on the fence initially. Then five more birds join them, making it seven in total. Next, four storks arrive, bringing the total number of birds to eleven. So, there are eleven birds and four storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 3 storks and 2 birds already sitting on the fence. If another 2 storks come, there will be 5 storks in total (3 + 2 = 5). And if 6 crows come, there will be 11 animals (5 storks + 6 crows) sitting on the fence. So, the number of storks is greater than the number of birds. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We have:
Pet ≈°torka (1) + 3 birds (3) = Total of 4 animals sitting on the fence.
Then, more birds come and join them:
4 new birds (4) + 4 existing birds (4) = Total of 8 birds sitting on the fence.
So, there are 8 birds sitting on the fence in total."
Response:  We have 6 storks and 2 birds initially sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds join them, making it 5 birds + 2 birds = 7 birds in total. So, there are now more birds than storks sitting on the fence!
Response:  We know that there are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. So, in total, we have 6 + 2 = 8 creatures sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, if the first chapter has x pages and the second chapter has y pages, then the total number of pages in the book is x + y.  Now, based on the information given in the question, we know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. Therefore, we can write the equation:  x + y = 59 (since 48 + 11 = 59).  Solving for x, we get:  x = 37 ( since 59 - 11 = 48).  Therefore, there are 37 pages more in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  First, we need to find out how many pages are in each of the two chapters. So, if the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages, then the difference between them is:  Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter.
"Response:  First, we know that the book has two chapters and each chapter has a different number of pages. Therefore, if the first chapter has 60 pages, then the second chapter must have x pages, where x is the difference between 93 and 60. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 93 - 60
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 33
Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter."
Response:  First, we know that the book has two chapters and the second chapter has 36 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter plus the number of pages in both chapters. So, if the first chapter has x pages, then the total number of pages in the book is given by: x + (36) = 67. Solving for x, we get: x = 31. Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter of the book.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book. Therefore, the total number of pages is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, if the first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages, and the third chapter has 24 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is:

66 + 35 + 24 = 125

Therefore, the book has 125 pages."
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 91 = 273 pages.  Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter:  First chapter has 91 pages, Second chapter has 23 pages, and Third chapter has 25 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages in first chapter and second chapter is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, there are 68 more pages in the first chapter than in the second chapter.
Response:  First, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has a different number of pages. So, if we write down the information given in the question like this: Chapter 1 - 35 pages, Chapter 2 - x pages, Chapter 3 - y pages, then we can start solving the problem. Since we know that x is less than or equal to y, since the second chapter has fewer pages than the third chapter. Now, let's use algebra to solve for x: x = 18 - 3 = 15 pages Therefore, the second chapter has 15 pages more than the third chapter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three chapters in the book and each chapter has a different number of pages as follows:  Chapter 1 - 53 pages, Chapter 2 - 75 pages, and Chapter 3 - 21 pages. Therefore, to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter: 53 pages - 21 pages = 32 pages. So, there are 32 pages more in the first chapter than in the third chapter.
Response:  If each chapter has 61 pages and there are 31 chapters in total, then the number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1931 pages.
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book with a total of 23 pages. Then, we are told that the first chapter has 10 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter is 10.
Response:  First, we know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is: 2 x 81 = 162 pages. Now, let's find out how many pages are in the second chapter. We are told that the second chapter has 68 pages. Therefore, the number of pages in the second chapter is: 68 pages.
Response:  We know that 39 campers went for a rowing trip in the afternoon. So, if we subtract this number from the total of 62 campers who went for a rowing trip, we get the number of campers who went in the morning: 62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, 23 campers went for a rowing trip in the morning.
Response:  We know that 52 campers went out to sail in the morning and 61 campers had sailing as their job for the afternoon. So, we need to find out how many more campers went out to sail in the afternoon than in the morning. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who sailed in the morning from the total number of campers who sailed in the afternoon:  Number of campers who sailed in the afternoon - Number of campers who sailed in the morning = 61 - 52 = 9 Therefore, there were 9 more campers who went out to sail in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response:  We know that 15 campers went for an early morning rowing session and some more campers left for their afternoon rowing session later in the day. To find out how many campers went for the afternoon rowing session, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for the early morning session from the total number of campers mentioned in the question. Therefore, if 32 campers were involved in rowing that day, then the number of campers who went for the afternoon rowing session is:

32 - 15 = 17

So, 17 campers went for the afternoon rowing session."
Response:  We know that 7 camps were rowed in the afternoon and 60 campers were sent to row that day. So, if we divide 60 by 7, we get 8.5 (rounded up to 9). Therefore, 9 campers went rowing in the morning.
Response:  We know that 36 campers went out in the morning, and 13 campers went out after lunch. So, the total number of campers who went out during the day is: 36 + 13 = 49. Therefore, there were 49 campers on the boat together.
Response:  We know that there were 44 campers who went for a morning rowing session and 39 campers who went in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went for a rowing session is: 44 + 39 = 83 campers. Therefore, 31 campers did not go for a rowing session (i.e., they stayed at the campsite).
Response:  We know that 53 campers went in the morning, and 48 campers went in the afternoon. So, if we subtract the number of campers who went in the afternoon from those who went in the morning, we get: 53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, there were 5 more campers who went in the morning than in the evening.
Response: 33 campers went in the morning, 34 campers went in the afternoon, and 10 campers went in the evening. So, to find out how many more campers went for a sail in the afternoon than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of campers who went in the evening from those who went in the afternoon: 34 - 10 = 24. Therefore, 24 campers went for a sail in the afternoon more than they did in the evening.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went for rowing in the morning and 59 campers went for hiking. So, altogether we have 72 campers (13 + 59). Now, we are told that 21 campers returned to rowing after lunchtime. Therefore, the total number of campers who were rowing is 72 - 21 = 51 campers.
Response:  We know that 29 campers went fishing in the morning and 66 campers went hiking. This means that 37 campers (29 + 66) did not go fishing or hiking. Therefore, 37 campers went sailing in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that 4 campera went hiking in the morning and 26 campers were at work during the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went sailing is 4 + 26 = 30. Therefore, 30 campers went sailing.
Response:  We know that there were 43 campers who vesled in the morning and an additional number of campers who vesled in the afternoon (but we don't know how many). So, the total number of campers who vesled during the day is equal to 43 + x, where x is the number of campers who vesled in the afternoon. Since all the campers vesled for one hour each, the total time spent vesling by all the campers is equal to 43 + x hours. Finally, since there are 24 hours in a day, we can set up the equation: 43 + x = 46, which simplifies to: x = 3. Therefore, there were 3 additional campers who vesled in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree and the tree had 7 apples to start with, then there are 3 (7 - 4) apples left on the tree. So, Rachel still has 3 apples on her tree.
Response:  We know that initially there were four apples and then one was picked up. So, after picking one apple, we have three apples left on the tree (3). Now, Rachel has picked another apple from those remaining three apples (2), leaving two apples still on the tree. Therefore, Rachel has picked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 7 ripe apples from her tree and there are still 5 unripe apples left on the tree. So, in total, there are 12 apples (7 + 5) on the tree. Therefore, if three of them are ripe, then the number of unripe apples is 12 - 3 = 9.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 mature apples from her tree and there are still 7 immature apples on the tree. If 6 of them are mature and the remaining ones are immature, then the total number of mature apples on the tree at the beginning was 6 + 7 = 13. So, the tree had 13 - 2 = 11 mature apples at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 6 mature apples on her tree. If she picked 6 mature apples and now has 2 mature apples + 4 immature apples, then initially there were 10 apples (6 + 4) on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples that the tree had at the beginning was 10.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 mature apples from her tree and now the tree has 2 mature apples and 27 immature apples. So, the total number of mature apples on the tree is 2 (the ones Rachel picked plus the new ones). Therefore, there are 29 non-mature apples on the tree (27 - 2 = 29).
Response:  At first, Rachel had 7 jabukas on her tree. Then, two new jabukas grew on the tree. So, now there are 7 + 2 = 9 jabukas on the tree. Finally, it is said that after these events, there are still 6 jabukas on the tree. Therefore, at the beginning, the tree had 6 jabukas.
Response:  Initially, Rachel had 2 jabukes on the tree. She picked 4 jabukes from her tree. So, now she has 2 + 4 = 6 jabukes on the tree. Then, three new jabukes grew on the tree after that. Therefore, the final number of jabukes on the tree is 6 + 3 = 9 jabukes.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 52 apples and she picked 2 from one of her trees. So, there are 50 apples left on the tree. Now, after Rachel picked some more apples, there are still 7 apples on the tree. Therefore, at the beginning, Rachel's tree had 50 + 7 = 57 apples.
Response:  Rachel picked 8 jabukas from each of the 3 trees, so she collected in total 24 jabukas. Since there were initially 9 jabukas on all the trees, we can deduce that the number of jabukas on each tree was 9 - 24 = -15. Therefore, there were no jabukas on any of the trees at the beginning.
Response:  If Rachel has 4 apple trees and she picked an apple from each tree, then she picked a total of 4 x 7 = 28 apples. So, there are 28 apples in total that Rachel picked.
Response:  We know that Ed has 2 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has x + 2 marbles.  Since Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, we can set up an equation: x + 2 = 19.  Solving for x, we get: x = 17. Therefore, Doug has lost 2 marbles.
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more kuglica than Doug. So if Doug has x kuglica, then Ed has x + 10 = 50 kuglica (since he has 10 more). Now we are told that Doug lost 11 of his kuglica on the field. So now Doug has x - 11 = 39 kuglica left (since he started with x and lost 11). Therefore, Ed has 50 - 11 = 39 more kuglica than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug initially. So if Ed has x marbles now, Doug must have y marbles now, where x - y = 6. Now we are told that Doug lost 7 of his marbles on the playground. Therefore, Doug now has x - 7 marbles. Since Ed had 22 marbles initially, and Ed still has all of them, Doug must have gained 22 - (x - 7) = 15 marbles. Thus, Doug has 15 + y = 22 marbles now. Solving for y, we get y = 7. So Doug has 15 marbles now.
Response:  At first, Ed had 5 more kuglica than Doug. So, if Ed had 27 kuglica and Doug had x kuglica at the beginning, we can write an equation: 27 = 5 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 22. Therefore, Doug had 22 kuglica at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug had x marbles, then Ed had 24 + x marbles.  Since Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more, we can set up an equation:  Ed = Doug - (27) + (9).  Solving for Doug gives us:  Doug = Ed - (24) + (9) = 15.  Therefore, Ed had 9 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had more marbles than Doug because he started with 29 and lost only 17 on the field. So, if we subtract the number of marbles Ed lost (17) from his initial amount (29), we get: 29 - 17 = 12. Therefore, Ed has 12 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. So if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has 19 + x marbles. Since Ed lost some marbles on the playground, he now has fewer marbles than before. Let's say he lost y marbles. Then we can write an equation based on what we know:  Number of marbles Ed has = 19 + x - y (1) Now, we are told that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, number of marbles Doug has = x - 8 (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: Number of marbles Ed has = 19 + x - y - 8 (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: Number of marbles Ed has = 11x - 7y (4) Now, we want to find out how many marbles Ed lost. So, let's substitute y = 5 (the number of marbles Ed lost) into equation (4): Number of marbles Ed has = 11x - 7(5) = 11x - 35 (5) Therefore, Ed lost 5 marbles.
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So if Ed has x marbles, then Doug has x - 30 marbles.  Since Ed lost 21 marbles on the field, he now has x - 21 marbles.  Therefore, Ed has 91 marbles (x - 21).
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more kuglica than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 17 kuglica now and he lost 20 on the field, then Doug must have had 39 kuglica (17 - 20 = 39).
Response:  We know that there are 408 students who have suggested adding potatoes to their menu and 42 students who have suggested adding saltines. So, we can write this as an equation: 408 + 42 = x, where x is the number of students who have suggested adding potatoes. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 42 from both sides of the equation: 408 - 42 = x. Simplifying, we get: x = 366. Therefore, more than three times as many students (366) have suggested adding potatoes compared to those who have suggested adding saltines (12).
"Response:  We know that 479 students have suggested adding potatoes to their menu and 489 students have suggested adding saltines. So, we can write this as:

Number of students who suggested adding saltines = 489 - Number of students who suggested adding potatoes
= 489 - 479
= 10
Therefore, 10 more students suggested adding saltines than those who suggested adding potatoes."
"Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 students suggested adding pirka (pepper) to their food, and 24 students suggested adding salt (slanina). So, we have:

Number of students who suggested adding pepper = 185
Number of students who suggested adding salt = 24
Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding some kind of seasoning or spice is 185 + 24 = 209 students."
Response:  We know that out of 288 students, 264 students suggested adding salt, and 264 - 20 = 244 students did not suggest adding salt. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is 244.
Response:  If 457 students have suggested adding pirulli (peas) to the menu and 294 students have suggested adding saltine crackers, then there are more students who want peas than those who want saltines. So, if 63 students have suggested adding peas more than twice as many students as suggested adding saltines, we can say that 63/2 = x where x is the number of students who suggested adding saltines. Therefore, there were 63 - x students who suggested adding peas. Since x cannot be negative, we know that at least 63 - x students wanted peas.
Response:  If 182 students suggested adding potatoes and 34 students suggested adding salt, then we have:  Number of students who suggested adding salt = 34.  Number of students who suggested adding potatoes = 182. Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding salt than those who suggested adding potatoes:  More students suggested adding salt = Number of students who suggested adding salt - Number of students who suggested adding potatoes. In this case, that would be: More students suggested adding salt = 34 - 182 = -148. So there are 148 fewer students who suggested adding salt than those who suggested adding potatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 324 students who suggested adding krumpi to the menu, 374 students who suggested adding salted nuts to the menu, and 128 students who suggested adding avocado to the menu. So, in total, we have: 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students who participated in suggesting new dishes.
"Response:  We know that 257 students suggested adding potatoes to their menu, while 120 suggested adding salt, and 97 suggested adding peas. So, we can write this as an equation: 257 + 120 = x + 97 where ""x"" represents the number of students who suggested adding salt. Now, we are asked how many more students suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt. Therefore, we need to subtract the two numbers: 257 - (120 + 97) =? = 63. So, there were 63 more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt."
Response:  We know that there are 144 students who have suggested adding pirka crumpir to their menu, and 79 of them have also suggested adding paradeja. So, the total number of students who have suggested adding some type of vegetable is 223 (144 + 79). On the other hand, we know that 467 students have suggested adding saltine to their menu. Therefore, the difference between the number of students who have suggested adding saltine and those who have suggested adding some type of vegetable is 244 (467 - 223). Finally, since 144 students have suggested adding pirka crumpir, the number of students who have suggested adding it more than any other item is 144 / (244 - 223) = 15/21 or approximately 0.68.
Response:  We know that out of 500 students, 228 students suggested adding kumara to their meals, which means that 45% (228/500) of the students wanted kumara.  We also know that 337 students suggested adding salt to their meals, which means that 69% (337/500) of the students wanted salt. Finally, we know that only 23 students suggested adding peas, which means that 4% (23/500) of the students wanted peas. Therefore, more than half of the students (69%) preferred salt over other options, while less than one-fourth (4%) preferred peas.
Response:  We know that there are 450 students in total and they have proposed different types of food out of a total of 66 options. If 450 students proposed adding potatoes to the menu, then we can say that x = 450 (since only one type of food was proposed). Now, if 38 students proposed adding salted fish to the menu, then we can say that y = 38. Finally, since the remaining students did not participate in proposing new dishes, z = 212 (since 212 - 450 = 38 + 212). Therefore, the answer is x = 450, y = 38, and z = 212.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu and 351 students suggested adding only saltine crackers, then there are a total of 569 students who made suggestions (218 + 351 = 569). So, the number of students who suggested adding saltine crackers is 351.
Response:  If 269 students suggested adding salt, and 330 students suggested adding potatoes to the menu, then there are more students who suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding salt. So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggested adding salt.  Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding potatoes than suggested adding salt. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who suggested adding salt from the total number of students who suggested adding potatoes:  Number of students who suggested adding potatoes - Number of students who suggested adding salt = 330 - 269 = 61  Therefore, 61 more students suggested adding potatoes than suggested adding salt.
"Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if we have x number of boys and y number of girls, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + y = 569 (total number of students)
Since there are more girls than boys, we can say that y is less than or equal to x. Therefore, we can rewrite the above equation as:
x + y ‚â§ 569
Now, let's solve for y:
y = 569 - x
Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:
y = 569 - 236
y = 333
Therefore, there are 333 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, we can start with the number of boys. The question states that there are 841 boys in the school. Now, let's find out how many girls there are. According to the question, there are 34 girls in the school. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 841 + 34 = 875. Since there are more boys than girls, the ratio of boys to girls is 875 : 34 = 26 : 1.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in this school.
"Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are x boys, then there are x + 228 girls. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
x + (x + 228) = 697
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 228 = 697
Subtracting 228 from both sides of the equation:
2x = 469
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 234
Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 635 + (510 - 635) = 485 Therefore, there are 485 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 868 boys and 281 more girls than boys, then the total number of students in the school is:  Number of boys + (Number of girls - Number of boys) = 868 + (281 - 868) = 593  Therefore, there are 593 students in that school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 boys and 142 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls - Number of girls = 700 + 142 - x Where x is the number of girls. Since there are 142 more boys than girls, we can write: x = 700 - 142 = 558 Therefore, there are 558 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 boys in school and 222 boys have joined the school. So, the total number of boys in the school is 706 + 222 = 928 boys. Now, we need to find out how many girls are left in the school after 418 girls have joined. The total number of girls left in the school is 706 - 418 = 288 girls. Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is 928 (boys) + 288 (girls) = 1216 students.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Number of girls = Initial number of girls + Newly arrived girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Similarly, we can calculate the number of boys as follows: Number of boys = Initial number of boys + Newly arrived boys = 811 + 0 = 811 boys. Therefore, there are 811 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in school. If 465 girls joined the school, then we can calculate how many boys did not join as follows: Number of boys = Total number of boys - Number of girls who joined = 410 - 465 = -155 boys. Therefore, there are more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 girls and 8 boys joined the school. So, now we need to find out how many girls are left in the school. To do this, we can subtract the number of girls who joined from the initial total number of girls: 732 - 682 = 50. Therefore, there are 50 girls currently enrolled in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys in the school and then 910 more boys joined the school. So, the total number of boys in the school now is:  Initially = 214 + Joined = 910 = 1124 boys.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Since there are 36 teachers, we can divide the number of students by the number of teachers to find out how many students each teacher teaches: 626 / 36 = 17.5 students per teacher. Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 students per teacher in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the final answer is:  Number of people in the school = 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396.
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys must be less than half the total number of students. So we can start with this equation: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Now, according to the question, the total number of students is 402 + 739 = 1141. Therefore, if there are more girls than boys in the school, we can write: Number of boys = 1141 - 402 = 739  So, there are 739 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are more girls than boys in the school, then the number of boys is less than half of the total number of students. So we can write an equation based on this information: Number of boys = Total number of students x (1/2)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of boys = 458 + 692 x (1/2)  Simplifying and solving for the number of boys, we get: Number of boys = 370  Therefore, there are 370 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in school initially. Then, 403 girls joined the school, which means that the total number of girls is now 403 + 257 = 660. Since we already knew that there were 362 boys, so the total number of boys plus girls is equal to 362 + 660 = 1022. Therefore, there are more girls than boys at this school.
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $2 left ( $18 - $16 = $2).
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, he must have spent $10.
Response:  Before he spent $9 and then another $8, Edward had $10 (since he started with $10). So, after spending $9 + $8 = $17, Edward has $10 - $17 = -$7 left. Therefore, Edward had $10 before he spent any money.
Response:  If Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books and each book cost him the same amount of money, then he spent $16 x 92 = $1480 on books. Since he has $6 left after buying the books, we can deduce that he had $1480 - $6 = $1474 before he started spending his money. Therefore, Edward had $1474 before he spent any money.
Response:  If Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books and he has $12 left, that means each book cost him half of his remaining money, or $12 / 2 = $6. So, each book cost $6.
Response:  If Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, he has $19 left after spending that amount. So, before spending any money, Edward had $19 + $6 = $25.
Response:  If Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, then he has $12 left after buying those items. So, the total amount that Edward spent on books is $4 + $3 = $7.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left: $$ \therefore \text {More spent on books} = \$ 19 - \$ 8 = \$ 11 $$ Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  If Edward had $17 initially and spent $10 of it, he would have $7 left ($17 - $10 = $7). So, Edward had $17 before he spent any money.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 tackles to the ground and David made 58 more than Zachary. So, if they worked together, they would have made a total of:  Total = 44 + (58 - 44) = 102 tackles.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 sklkcs and David made 44 sklkcs. To find out how many more sklkcs Zachary made than David, we need to subtract the number of sklkcs David made from the number of sklkcs Zachary made:

Zachary made 51 sklkcs - David made 44 sklkcs = 7 sklkcs
So, Zachary made 7 more sklkcs than David."
"Response:  We know that David made 44 movements and Zachary made more than 9 movements. So, we can say that Zachary made x movements. Now, we have to find out what value of x satisfies the condition given in the problem. According to the problem, David made 9 more movements than Zachary, so we can write:
x = 44 - 9
x = 35
Therefore, Zachary made 35 movements."
Response:  We know that David made 51 pieces of artwork and Zachary made 49 more than him. So, if they worked together, they would have made a total of 51 + 49 = 100 pieces of artwork.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 jumps and David made 19 more than Zachary. So, David made 59 + 19 = 78 jumps.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 jumps and David made 29 more than Zachary. So, David made 44 + 29 = 73 jumps.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 17 more than David and 10 less than Zachary. So if David did x sklkove, then Zachary did x + 17 = 53 sklkove. Similarly, if David did y sklkove, then Zachary did y - 10 = 14 sklkove. Therefore, we can conclude that Zachary did 53 sklkove.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 35 skleks and David made 58 more than him. So, David made 58 + 35 = 93 skleks. Now we need to find out how many skleks less than Zachary made. According to the question, David made 87 fewer skleks than Zachary. Therefore, Zachary made 93 - 87 = 6 skleks more than David.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 46 squats and 58 push-ups.  David did 38 more push-ups than squats (so he did 38 + 46 = 84 push-ups). So if David did 62 fewer push-ups than Zachary, then Zachary did 84 - 62 = 22 push-ups more than David. Therefore, Zachary did 22 more crunches than push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 39 more turns than Zachary. So if Zachary made 19 turns, then David made 39 + 19 = 58 turns. Therefore, David made 58 sklkova.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 turns and David made 22 more than Zachary. So, David made 73 turns (51 + 22 = 73). Now we are told that John made 4 fewer turns than David. Therefore, John made 69 turns (73 - 4 = 69).
Response:  We know that Zachary made 15 sklekov on the terrace and David made 39 more than Zachary. So, David made 39 + 15 = 54 sklekov on the terrace. Now we know that John worked 9 fewer sklekov than David. Therefore, John worked 54 - 9 = 45 sklekov on the terrace. Finally, to find out how many more sklekov Zachary worked than John, we subtract their number of sklekov from each other: Zachary worked 15 - 45 = -30 sklekov more than John.
"Response:  If David made 30 more baskets than Zachary, that means Zachary made x baskets. Since David made 37 baskets in total, we can write an equation:

David = Zachary + x

Now, we know that David made 30 more baskets than Zachary, so we can subtract x from both sides of the equation:

2x = 37 - 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

So, Zachary made 7 baskets."
"Response:  We know that David made 56 more baskets than Zachary. So if they together made x baskets, then we can write an equation as follows:
David made 56 more baskets = (x - Zachary's number of baskets)
We are given that Zachary made 40 baskets. Substituting this value into the above equation, we get:
56 + (x - 40) = x
Now, simplify the equation:
26 = x
Therefore, David and Zachary together made 26 baskets."
"Response:  We know that David did more than Zachary because he had 40 more skunks than Zachary. So if Zachary did x skunks, then David did x + 40 skunks. Also, we know that David did fewer skunks than Zachary because he had 17 less skunks than Zachary. Therefore, the difference between the number of skunks done by David and Zachary is equal to 17. So, we can write an equation as follows:
x + 40 = y - 17
Here, x represents the number of skunks done by Zachary, y represents the number of skunks done by David, and 40 and 17 are constants representing the differences mentioned in the question. Solving for y (the number of skunks done by David), we get:
y = x + 40 - 17
Substituting x = 34 (since Zachary did 34 skunks), we get:
y = 34 + 40 - 17
y = 57
Therefore, David did 57 skunks during the training session."
"Response:  If David did 36 more sit-ups than Zachary and 33 less sit-ups than Zachary, then...

David did 79 sit-ups (36 + 33 = 79).
Zachary did 21 crunches (58 - 33 = 21)."
"Response:  If David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 less than him, that means David did x push-ups. Since Zachary did y push-ups, we can write an equation:

David did x push-ups
Zachary did y push-ups

We know from the problem statement that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 27 to both sides of the equation:

x = y + 27

Now we also know that David did 7 fewer push-ups than Zachary, so we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x - 7 = y + 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = y + 20

So if Zachary did y push-ups, David did x push-ups, where x = y + 20."
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 5 pages of her homework in mathematics and 2 pages of her homework for reading. So, we can write this as:
Mathematics: 5 pages
Reading: 2 pages
Now, let's compare these two quantities to find out which one is greater. To do this, we need to convert both quantities into numbers. For example, if Rachel completed 5 pages of mathematics homework, then she completed 5 x 4 = 20 problems (since each page typically contains 4 problems). Similarly, if she completed 2 pages of reading homework, then she read 2 x 8 = 16 sentences (since each page typically contains 8 sentences). Therefore, we can represent the comparison between the two quantities as follows:
Mathematics: 20 problems
Reading: 16 sentences
As you can see, the number of problems in mathematics is greater than the number of sentences in reading. So, the answer to the question is:
Mathematics has more pages than Reading."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to finish 3 pages of homework from mathematics and 4 pages of homework for reading. So, in total, she had to finish 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework. Therefore, the number of more pages of homework for reading than mathematics is 7 - 3 = 4 pages.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 pages of homework in mathematics and additional pages for reading, then she had to complete at least 7 pages of reading homework. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of homework in mathematics and she completed 4 more pages than she did in reading, then we can say that...
Response:  If Rachel finished 8 pages of homework in mathematics and she had to finish 3 more pages than she did in reading, then we can say that...
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 8 pages of homework from mathematics and she completed 6 more than that means she completed 14 pages (8 + 6 = 14). So, the number of pages of homework Rachel had to complete is 14.
Response:  If Rachel finished 10 pages of homework from mathematics, and she needed to finish 3 more pages than that, then she needs to finish 13 pages (10 + 3 = 13).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to finish two sides of a homework assignment in mathematics. Each side typically contains 5 problems, so she needs to solve 10 problems in total (2 x 5 = 10).  Next, we are told that she also has to read three pages from a book and complete 10 pages from another book. Since each page usually contains around 400-600 words, let's assume an average length of 500 words per page for simplicity. Therefore, Rachel needs to read 3 x 500 = 1500 words from the first book and 10 x 500 = 5000 words from the second book.  Finally, we are given that Rachel has to complete 10 pages from a science textbook. Assuming each page contains around 500 words like the other books, Rachel needs to read 10 x 500 = 5000 words from the science textbook as well.  In summary, Rachel needs to finish 10 + 1500 + 5000 = 7600 words in total across all subjects.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to finish 9 pages of homework from mathematics, 2 pages of homework from reading, and 96 pages of homework from biology. So, in total, she had to finish 107 pages of homework (9 + 2 + 96). Therefore, the number of more pages of homework from mathematics than from reading is 107 - 2 = 105 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 11 pages of her homework in mathematics and 3 pages in biology. So, the number of pages she completed in mathematics is 11/2 = 5.5 pages more than the number of pages she completed in biology. Therefore, the answer is 5.5 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel finished 7 pages of her homework in mathematics and 11 pages in reading. Therefore, she has completed a total of 18 pages of homework (7 + 11 = 18). Now, let's find out how many pages she had left to complete from her biology homework. According to the question, she had 8 pages remaining to finish from her biology homework. So, the difference between the number of pages she completed and the number of pages she had left to complete is equal to 8 - 18 = -10 pages. In other words, Rachel had 10 fewer pages of homework in biology than she had completed.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 9 pages of homework from mathematics and 11 pages of homework from reading. So, in total she needs to finish 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework. However, we are also given that she has already finished 29 pages of homework from biology, so in total she needs to finish 20 - 29 = -9 pages of homework. Therefore, Rachel does not have to finish any homework from mathematics or reading.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 8 pages of homework from mathematics and 3 pages from biology. So, in total she needs to finish 11 pages (8 + 3).
Response:  We know that Rachel has to finish 10 pages of homework from mathematics and she finished 5 pages. So, there are 5 + 10 = 15 pages left to be done. Now, we are told that she also had to do 6 pages of homework in biology. Therefore, the total number of pages Rachel had to finish is 15 + 6 = 21 pages.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 2 pages of homework from reading and 4 pages of homework from mathematics. So, we can write an equation as follows: Reading = 2 Homework = 4 Mathematics =? To find out how many more pages of homework Rachel did in mathematics than in reading, we need to subtract the number of pages she did in reading from the number of pages she did in mathematics. Therefore, we can solve for the value of ""Mathematics"" as follows: Mathematics = 4 - 2 = 2 pages Now we know that Rachel did 2 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading."
Response:  We know that Rachel had to finish 4 pages of homework from reading and 7 pages from mathematics. So, we can write an equation: 4 + 7 = x, where x is the number of pages of homework from biology. Now, we are asked how many more pages of homework were in mathematics than in reading. Therefore, we subtract the number of pages of homework from reading from the total number of pages of homework: x - 4 = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 11. So, there were 11 more pages of homework in mathematics than in reading.
Response:  Ujutro (morning) Jack received 6 emails and Popodne (afternoon) he received 2 more emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails during these two time periods.
Response:  At 8 pm, Jack received 8 emails.  At 9 am, he received 6 emails. So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the evening and the morning is:  8 - 6 = 2. Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the evening than in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and he received more than 4 emails in the afternoon, then we can conclude that he received a total of 5 emails during the day. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 11 emails that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 11/2 = 5.5 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 72 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of 77 emails (5 + 72). Therefore, Jack received 77 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 12 emails (4 + 8 = 12).
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the evening, so he has received a total of 7 emails (3 + 4 = 7).
Response:  Jack received 10 mejlov in the morning and 7 mejlov in the evening. So, he received a total of 10 + 7 = 17 mejlov. Therefore, Jack has more mejlov in the evening than in the morning by 3 mejla (17 - 10).
Response:  Ujutro (morning) Jack received 9 emails and in the afternoon he received 10 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack received during the day is: 9 + 10 = 19. Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  Jack has received 10 meals in the morning, 5 in the afternoon, and 4 in the evening. So he has received a total of 19 meals (10 + 5 + 4). Therefore, he has received more meals in the afternoon than in the evening. The difference between the number of meals he received in the afternoon and evening is 5 - 4 = 1.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, and then he received some more emails in the evening. So, let's say he received x emails in the evening. Since we know that Jack received a total of 10 emails during the day, we can write an equation: 6 + x = 10. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 4. Therefore, Jack received 4 additional emails in the evening.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 67 messages (3 + 64 = 67). Then, he received 5 more emails and 54 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 121 messages (5 + 54 = 121) that day. Therefore, Jack received an average of 67 + 121 = 188 messages per day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 11 messages (5 + 6 = 11). Then, he received 9 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon, for a total of 16 messages (9 + 7 = 16). Therefore, Jack received a total of 16 messages per day (11 + 16 = 27).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. Then he received 3 more emails and 44 more letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 10 + 3 = 13 emails in the morning and 12 + 44 = 56 letters in the morning. Therefore, Jack received more emails (13) than letters (56) in the morning.
Response:  In the morning (ujutro), Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. Then he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon (popodne). So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 letters in the morning. Therefore, Jack received more letters than emails in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 messages yesterday. So he received 91 - 6 = 85 emails per day. Then, he received 2 more emails today and sent 74 messages, so he received 85 + 2 = 87 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters yesterday. So he sent 4 - 2 = 2 letters per day yesterday. Then, he received 6 emails and sent 8 letters today. So he sent 8 - 0 = 8 letters today. Therefore, Jack sent 2 + 8 = 10 letters in total during these two days.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and then received additional emails later in the day, we can assume that he received an equal number of emails at each time interval (morning, afternoon, evening). So, if Jack received 7 emails in the morning, he must have received 2 more emails in the afternoon (since there are 5 hours between the morning and afternoon) and 1 more email in the evening (since there are 4 hours between the afternoon and evening), for a total of 9 emails received throughout the day. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails after lunchtime and 5 emails in the morning. So, he received a total of 8 emails during the day (morning + afternoon). Now, we need to find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning:  Number of emails received in the morning = 5 Emails after lunchtime = 3 Total number of emails received during the day = 8 Subtracting the number of emails received in the afternoon from the number of emails received in the morning gives us: More emails were received in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Morning = 5 emails Afternoon = 3 emails
Response:  If Jack received 3 emails after noon, that means he did not receive any emails before noon. So, the number of emails Jack received before noon is 0.  If Jack received 6 emails at dawn, that means he received 6 - 3 = 3 emails before noon. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received during the day is 3 + 0 + 6 = 9 emails.
Response:  We know that the snake (≈°takor) jumped 9 inches and the frog (≈æaba) jumped 12 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped beyond the snake, we can subtract the distance the snake jumped from the distance the frog jumped:  Distance = Frog's jump - Snake's jump  Distance = 12 inches - 9 inches  Distance = 3 inches  So, the frog jumped 3 inches beyond the snake.
Response:  We know that the stork jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches separately. So, if they are together, their combined distance would be: Distance = Stork's distance + Frog's distance = 31 + 35 = 66 inches. Therefore, they have jumped together 66 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the starting point and the end of the jump is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by each animal. So, if the total distance traveled by all three animals together is x inches, then the distance traveled by each animal separately can be represented as x/3, since they are traveling together. Therefore, the distance traveled by the frog (≈æaba) can be calculated as follows: Distance traveled by the frog = Total distance - (Distance traveled by the snake + Distance traveled by the mouse) = x - (36 + 15) = 29 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the stork jumped 25 inches (63 cm). Then, we are told that the frog jumped 18 inches (46 cm) beyond the skaters. Finally, we learn that the mouse jumped 2 inches (5 cm) beyond the frog. So, if the frog jumped 18 inches (46 cm), then the mouse must have jumped 20 inches (51 cm). Therefore, the mouse jumped 20 inches (51 cm).
Response:  Firstly, we know that the stork jumped 30 cm. Then, the frog jumped 10 inches (which is equal to 25 cm) beyond the stork's distance. Finally, the mouse jumped 20 inches (which is equal to 51 cm) beyond the frog's distance. So, the total distance traveled by the mouse from the starting point is:  Distance = 30 + 25 + 51 = 106 cm. Therefore, the mouse has traveled 106 cm beyond the starting point.
"Response:  We know that:

* The distance that the frog jumped is 39 inches (or 94 cm) less than the distance that the mouse jumped.
* The distance that the snake jumped is 30 cm.

So we can write an equation based on these two pieces of information:

Distance = 39 - x
where x is the distance that the mouse jumped.

We are also given that the mouse jumped 94 cm less than the distance that the snake jumped. So we can substitute this value into our equation:

Distance = 39 - (94 - x)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use algebra to solve for x, which is the distance that the frog jumped?"
"Response:  We know that:

* The stork jumped 25 inches (stork = 25)
* The frog jumped 32 inches further than the skaters (frog = 32 + x)
* The mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog (mouse = 32 - x)

We can write an equation based on these statements:

Stork + Frog = Mouse

Substituting the values given in the problem:

25 + (32 + x) = 26 - x

Simplifying and solving for x:

x = 7

So, the mouse jumped 7 inches."
"Response:  We know that:

* The stork jumped 24 inches (60 cm).
* The frog jumped 33 inches (84 cm) beyond the skaters.
* The mouse jumped 5 inches (13 cm) less than the frog.

So, if the frog jumped x inches beyond the skaters, then the distance between the skaters and the mouse is equal to x - 5 inches. Therefore, we can write:

x - 5 = 33

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38 inches (97 cm)

Therefore, the mouse jumped 38 inches (97 cm) beyond the skaters."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 5 cm further than the snake. So, if the snake jumped x inches (in), then the frog jumped x + 5 cm. Now we are given that the snake jumped 13 in, so the frog jumped 13 + 5 = 18 in.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 10 cm more than the snake. So, if the snake jumped 35 inches (which is equal to 89 cm), then the frog jumped 89 cm + 10 = 99 cm. Therefore, they both jumped together 99 cm.
"Response:  We know that:

* The distance between the starting point and where the frog jumped is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by the snake (30 cm) and the mouse (20 cm). Therefore, we can write: Distance = 30 + 20 = 50 cm.
* Since the frog jumped further than the snake, it means that its distance from the starting point is greater than 30 cm. So, let's call this distance x cm. Then, we have: x > 30.
* Now, we are told that the frog jumped 10 cm more than the snake. This means that if the snake had jumped x cm, then the frog would have jumped x + 10 cm.
* Finally, since the mouse jumped less than the frog, we know that its distance from the starting point is less than x + 10 cm. So, let's call this distance y cm. Then, we have: y < x + 10.
Now, we want to find out how far the frog jumped. From the information given in the problem, we know that the total distance traveled by all three animals together is equal to 50 cm. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + y + z = 50, where z is the distance traveled by the mouse.
Solving for x, we get: x = 40 cm.
So, the frog jumped 40 cm."
"Response:  We know that:

* The distance between the starting point and where the snake stopped is 39 inches (as stated).
* The distance between the starting point and where the frog stopped is 19 inches less than the distance traveled by the snake (as stated).
* The distance between the starting point and where the mouse stopped is 12 inches less than the distance traveled by the frog (as implied).

So we can write equations based on these statements:

Distance = 39 inches (given)
Distance - 19 inches = Distance_frog (from statement 2)
Distance - 12 inches = Distance_mouse (from statement 3)

Now we have three linear equations with three unknowns (distance traveled by each animal):

Distance = 39 + (-19) + (-12) =?

Solving this system of equations, we get:

Distance = 40 inches

Therefore, the mouse skidded 40 inches."
"Response:  We know that:

* The stork jumped 21 inches (53 cm) further than the frog.
* The mouse jumped 16 inches (40 cm) less than the frog.

So, if the frog jumped x inches, then the stork jumped x + 21 inches and the mouse jumped x - 16 inches.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

stork = frog + 21
mouse = frog - 16

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

stork = 37 inches (94 cm)
mouse = 21 inches (53 cm)

Therefore, the stork jumped 37 inches (94 cm) further than the mouse, and the mouse jumped 21 inches (53 cm) fewer than the frog."
Response:  We know that the frog jumped 39 inches and the skier jumped 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped compared to the skier, we need to divide the distance the frog jumped by twice the distance the skier jumped. So, if the frog jumped 39 inches and the skier jumped 17 inches, then the ratio of their jumps is 39/2(17) = 39/34 = 1.14. Therefore, the frog jumped 14% farther than the skier.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the frog jumped 20 cm more than the mouse. So, if the mouse jumped x cm, then the frog jumped 20 + x cm. Secondly, we are told that the stork jumped 15 cm. Therefore, the total distance traveled by all three animals is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. Finally, we can set up an equation using this information and solve for x (the distance the mouse jumped): Distance = Stork's jump + Mouse's jump + Frog's jump Distance = 15 + x + 20 x = 35 Since the total distance traveled by all three animals is 35 cm, we can substitute this value into our equation: x = 35 - 15 - 20 = 8 cm Thus, the mouse jumped 8 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the distance between the stork and the frog is equal to 14 inches (since the stork skoƒçio 14 inƒça). Secondly, we know that the distance between the frog and the mouse is equal to 16 inches less than the distance between the frog and the stork (since the frog skoƒçio 37 inƒça dalje od skakaƒça). Finally, we can conclude that the distance between the mouse and the skakaƒç is equal to 16 inches minus the distance between the frog and the stork (since the mouse skoƒçio 16 inƒça manje od ≈æabe). Therefore, the answer is 50 inches (since the distance between the mouse and the skakaƒç is equal to 16 inches minus the distance between the frog and the stork).
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 14 tablespoons of butter and 6 tablespoons of sugar. The person has already added 5 tablespoons of butter. So, to find out how much more butter she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total required amount: 14 - 5 = 9 tablespoons. Therefore, the person needs to add an additional 9 tablespoons of butter.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 times more sugar than flour. So if there are 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 280 grams), then we need 360 grams of sugar (since 9 x 280 = 2520). However, since she has already added 4 cups of flour, which means she has used 320 grams of flour so far. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 140 grams of sugar (360 - 320 = 140).
Response:  If she has already added 6 cups of flour and needs 8 more cups to complete the recipe, that means she still needs 2 cups of flour (8 - 6 = 2). Since each cup of flour requires 4 tablespoons of butter, she will need an additional 8 tablespoons of butter (2 cups x 4 tablespoons/cup = 8 tablespoons). Therefore, the total amount of ingredients needed is: 6 + 2 + 8 = 16.
Response:  If she has already put in 5 spoons of flour and needs 2 more spoons than sugar, then we can calculate it as follows: Number of spoons of sugar needed = Total number of spoons of flour - Number of spoons of flour already used + 2 = 11 - 5 + 2 = 6 spoons of sugar. Therefore, she needs 6 additional spoons of sugar.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 tablespoons of sugar and several more tablespoons of butter. She has already added 3 tablespoons of butter. So, if she still needs to add 6 tablespoons of butter, then how many tablespoons of butter does the recipe require in total?  Therefore, the answer is 6 tablespoons of butter.
Response:  If she has already put in 4 tablespoons of butter (which is equal to 1/2 cup), then we know that she still needs 8 tablespoons more. So, if she needs 12 tablespoons of butter in total, and she has already used 4 tablespoons, then she still needs 8 tablespoons or 1/2 cup.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tablespoons of butter and 5 tablespoons of sugar.  Meri has already added 3 tablespoons of butter and 62 tablespoons of sugar. To find out how many more tablespoons of butter she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required: 3 - 62 = -60. So, Meri needs to add 60 more tablespoons of butter.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 5 tablespoons of butter and 14 tablespoons of sugar. So far, she has added 10 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of sugar. To find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe: 14 - 2 = 12 tablespoons of sugar remaining to be added. Therefore, she still needs to add 12 tablespoons of sugar.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 tablespoons of butter and we have already added 11 tablespoons. So, to find out how many more tablespoons are needed, we can subtract the amount already added from the total required: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, she needs to add one more table spoon of butter.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 10 tablespoons of butter and we have already added 7 tablespoons. So, to find out how many more tablespoons are needed, we can subtract the amount already added from the total required: 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, the recipe needs an additional 3 tablespoons of butter.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 12 tablespoons of butter and we have already added 2 tablespoons. So, to find out how many more tablespoons of butter are needed, we can subtract the number of tablespoons we have already added from the total amount required:

Number of tablespoons of butter left = Total amount of butter required - Number of tablespoons added
= 12 tablespoons - 2 tablespoons
= 10 tablespoons
Therefore, Meri needs to add an additional 10 tablespoons of butter to the recipe."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 times as much sugar as salt in the recipe, so if there are x grams of salt, there are 6x grams of sugar. Since the recipe already uses 5 grams of sugar, we need to find out how many more grams of sugar it needs. Therefore, we can calculate this as follows:

Total amount of sugar needed = Total amount of sugar used + Amount of sugar needed
= 6x - 5

So, the recipe needs an additional 1 gram of sugar (6x - 5)."
Response:  We know that there are 12 tablespoons of butter and 13 tablespoons of sugar required for the recipe. The person has already added 2 tablespoons of sugar. So, we need to find out how many more tablespoons of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required (13 tablespoons) by the amount of sugar she has already added (2 tablespoons): 13 / 2 = 6.5 tablespoons. Therefore, the person needs to add 6.5 tablespoons of sugar more to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tablespoons of butter and 6 tablespoons of sugar. The person has already added 4 tablespoons of sugar. So, to find out how many more tablespoons of butter she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount required: 9 - 4 = 5 tablespoons of butter left to be added. Therefore, the person needs to add an additional 5 tablespoons of butter.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. The woman has already added 2 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how much more flour is required. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required: 6 - 2 = 4 cups of flour are still needed. Therefore, the woman needs to add 4 more cups of flour.
Response:  If she has already added 11 brackets of sugar and the recipe requires 5 brackets of sugar more than the number of brackets of flour, then we need to find out how many brackets of flour are required in total.  We know that there are 14 brackets of flour in total, so if she has already added 11 brackets of flour, then the remaining amount is 3 brackets (14 - 11 = 3). Therefore, she needs to add 3 brackets of sugar more than the number of brackets of flour left (3). So, she needs to add 3 + 5 = 8 brackets of sugar more.
Response:  If she has already put in 4 tablespoons of butter and needs another 5 tablespoons more than the amount of sugar required (which is 3 tablespoons), then we can calculate it as follows:  Total amount of sugar needed = 3 tablespoons + (5 tablespoons x number of tablespoons she has already used) = 3 + (5 x 4) = 3 + 20 = 23 tablespoons. So, she still needs 23 tablespoons of butter to complete the recipe.
Response:  If she has already put in 4 spoons of sugar and needs another 12 spoons to make the recipe, that means she still needs 8 more spoons of sugar (12 - 4 = 8). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that she has already added 7 ≈†olja bra≈°na and 60 ≈†olja ≈°e—õera. So, we need to find out how much more ≈†olja bra≈°–Ω–∞ she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of ingredients required (14 ≈†olja bra≈°na) by the amount of ingredients she has already added (7 + 60 = 67). This means she still needs to add 73 ≈†olja bra≈°na. Therefore, she needs to add another 73 ≈†olja bra≈°na to complete the recipe.
Response:  If she has already added 12 tablespoons of butter and 10 tablespoons of sugar, then we know that she has used half of the total amount of sugar required for the recipe (6 tablespoons). So, to find out how much more sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already used from the total amount required: 6 tablespoons - 10 tablespoons = 4 tablespoons. Therefore, she still needs to add 4 tablespoons of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 3 cups of sugar, and she has already added 6 cups of flour (which is equal to 6/4 = 1.5 cups). So, we need to find out how much more sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount she has already added: 3 cups / 1.5 cups = 2 cups. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 2 cups of sugar.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 times more sugar than flour and 4 times more salt than flour. So if we have already added 4 tablespoons of flour (which is equal to 1/4 of the total amount), then we need to add 3 times as much sugar as flour (since there are 9 times as many sugar as flour). Therefore, we need to add 3 x 9 = 27 tablespoons of sugar. Since each table spoon of sugar contains 16 teaspoons of sugar, we need to add 27 / 16 = 17 teaspoons of sugar.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 sugar cubes, and we have already added 2 sugar cubes. So, to find out how many more sugar cubes we need to add, we can subtract the number of sugar cubes we have already added from the total number of sugar cubes required:  Number of remaining sugar cubes = Total number of sugar cubes - Number of sugar cubes added = 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, we need to add 7 more sugar cubes to the mixture.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 sugar spoons and 6 salt spoons. The person has already added 12 bread spoons (which is equal to 48 teaspoons). So, we need to find out how many more sugar spoons are needed than salt spoons. To do this, we divide the number of sugar spoons required by the number of salt spoons already added: 11 / 48 = 0.23 or approximately 1/4 spoon of sugar. Therefore, the person needs to add one more spoon of sugar.
Response:  We know that there are 7 tablespoons of sugar required in the recipe and our friend has already added 4 tablespoons. So, we need to find out how many more tablespoons she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total number of tablespoons required by the number of tablespoons she has already added: 7 tablespoons - 4 tablespoons = 3 tablespoons. Therefore, our friend needs to add an additional 3 tablespoons of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  If she has already added 10 sugar, then we know that she has used half of the total amount (6/12) = 3/4 cup of sugar so far. Now, if she wants to make the recipe as per the given instructions, she needs to add another 1/4 cup of sugar (8/12) = 2 tablespoons. Therefore, she needs to add an additional 2 tablespoons of butter.
Response:  We know that 19 families of birds live near the mountain and 60 families have left for winter. So, if we subtract the number of families that left from the total number of families living nearby, we get: Number of remaining families = Total number of families - Number of families that left = 19 - 60 = -41 families. Therefore, there are 41 fewer families of birds living near the mountain than before they left for winter.
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain and 7 families have left for winter. So, we can say that there are 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds remaining in the area.
Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated south for winter and 14 remained in the area near the mountain. So, initially there were 34 bird families (20 + 14) living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 85 families of birds live near the mountain. If 23 families have migrated to Africa and 37 families have migrated to Asia, then we can calculate how many families are left near the mountain as follows: Total number of bird families = 85 Number of bird families that migrated to Africa = 23 Number of bird families that migrated to Asia = 37 Therefore, the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is equal to the total number of bird families minus the number of families that migrated to Africa plus the number of families that migrated to Asia: Number of bird families remaining near the mountain = 85 - 23 + 37 = 45 So there are 45 families of birds remaining near the mountain after some have migrated to other regions.
Response:  We know that 8 families of birds live near the mountain and 42 families have migrated to Africa. So, we can say that 50 families (8 + 42) of birds have left their original place to go somewhere else. Now, let's find out how many more families went to Asia than to Africa:  Number of families that went to Asia = Total number of families - Number of families that went to Africa  Number of families that went to Asia = 50 - 42 = 8 Therefore, 8 more families of birds went to Asia than to Africa.
Response:  We know that 94 families of birds went to Asia and 47 families went to Africa. So, in total, 94 + 47 = 141 families of birds migrated from Europe. Now we are told that almost all animals migrate to warmer lands during winter. This means that most of these 141 bird families will also migrate to warmer lands. However, since some birds may not migrate at all or may migrate to different places than their original homes, let's assume that only 50% of these bird families actually migrate to warmer lands. Therefore, out of the 141 bird families that migrated from Europe, 50% of them is equal to 70 families (since 70 is half of 141). So, there are 70 families of birds that migrated to warmer lands outside of Europe.
Response:  We know that 18 families of birds live near the mountain and 38 families have migrated to Africa, so we can say that there are 56 families of birds left in the area (18 + 38 = 56). Now, let's find out how many families of birds have migrated to Asia. According to the question, 80 families of birds have migrated to Asia. So, the total number of families of birds that have migrated for winter is 80 + 56 = 136. Therefore, the answer is 136.
Response:  We know that 87 families of birds live near the mountain. If we add 18 new families of birds to them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain will be: 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds.
Response:  We know that 49 families of birds live near the mountain and 59 families have migrated to warmer lands for winter. This means that 10 (49 - 59) families of birds are still near the mountain. Therefore, there are 10 bird families left near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 families of birds have migrated to warmer lands and only 41 family remains near the mountain. So, if we divide the number of remaining families (41) by the total number of families (68), we get:  $ \frac {41} {68} = \frac {27}{35} $  Therefore, there are $\boxed{27/35}$ times more families of birds left near the mountain than those who migrated away.
Response:  We know that 86 families of birds have already migrated to warmer lands and we want to find out how many more families remained behind. So, if there were initially 45 families living near the mountain, then the number of families remaining behind is equal to 86 - 45 = 41. Therefore, 41 additional families of birds migrated away from the mountain compared to those who stayed behind.
Response:  We know that 41 families of birds live near the mountain and 35 families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, there are 41 - 35 = 6 more families of birds in Africa than in Asia. So, the number of families of birds that migrated to Africa is 6 times greater than the number of families that migrated to Asia.
"Response:  We know that:
Zima is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer lands.  Three bird families live near the mountain.  Twenty-six new bird families have arrived to live near the mountain from the Arctic while two bird families have flown south for winter.  How many bird families are left near the mountain?
Let X be the number of bird families living near the mountain initially (i.e., before any migration).
We know that 3 bird families were already living near the mountain. So, X = 3.
New birds arriving from the Arctic: 26 √ó 100% = 26 + X = 58
Two bird families flew south for winter: -2 √ó 100% = -4
So, the final number of bird families living near the mountain is: X + 58 - 4 = 60.
Therefore, there are 60 bird families living near the mountain after the migration."
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 pencils for his birthday and he gave or lost 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, we can write an equation:  Number of pencils = 253 - 70 = 183 To find out how many pencils are left at the end of the school year, we need to multiply the number of pencils by the number of months in the school year:  Number of pencils x Months in the school year = 183 x 9 = 1641 Pencils Therefore, there are 1641 pencils left at the end of the school year.
Response:  If Paul received 551 toys for his birthday and lost or gave away 374 of them until the end of the school year, then he must have had 177 toys left at the end of the year. So, he got 551 - 374 = 177 toys for his birthday.
"Response:  We know that Paul gave away 111 olovaka to his friends during the school year and lost 106 olovaka. So, the total number of olovaka he has left is:

111 - 106 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 olovaka remaining in Paul's possession."
Response:  If Paul received 65 crayons for his birthday and gave away 213 crayons to his friends during the school year, then he has 44 crayons left (65 - 213 = 44).  If he lost 16 crayons, then he has 28 crayons left (44 - 16 = 28). Therefore, Paul has 28 crayons left or 28 olovaka.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 589 crayons for his birthday and lost 161 of them during the school year. So he has 428 crayons left (589 - 161 = 428). Now, we need to find out how many more crayons he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he gave away: 571 - 161 = 410. Therefore, Paul gave away 410 more crayons than he lost.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul gave away 90 olovaka to his friends during the school year. Therefore, he has 110 - 90 = 20 more olovaka than he gave away.  Next, we are told that he lost 412 olovaka. So, the difference between the number of olovaka he lost and the number he gave away is 412 - 90 = 322 olovaka.  Hence, Paul has lost 322 olovaka more than he gave away.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 pencils and lost 558, then he has 332 left. So, he received 332 pencils for his birthday.
Response:  If Paul gave away 52 envelopes for his birthday and lost 535 envelopes during the school year, then he had initially 492 envelopes (since he started with 492 - 52 = 440). So, the number of envelopes that were either given away or lost is equal to 535 - 440 = 95.
Response:  If Paul received 521 pieces of chalk and had 66 rubber bands at the end of the school year, that means he had 521 + 66 = 587 items in total. Since he didn't lose any chalk or rubber bands, we can conclude that he must have given away some of them as gifts. So, the number of chalk pieces he gave away is equal to the difference between his initial amount (587) and the final amount he had (154). Therefore, the number of chalk pieces he gave away is 587 - 154 = 433. Similarly, since he didn't lose any rubber bands either, the number of rubber bands he gave away is also equal to the difference between his initial amount (66) and the final amount he had (0), which is 66. Thus, the answer to the question is 433 for chalk and 66 for rubber bands.
Response:  If Paul received 531 pieces of chalk and lost 38 gumballs, he would have 493 remaining (531 - 38 = 493).  Since he didn't lose any chalk at the end of the school year, he must have had 493 chalk pieces left as well. So, there are more than twice as many chalk pieces as gumballs that Paul has left (493 / 2 = 246). Therefore, Paul has 246 more chalk pieces than gumballs left.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 601 pieces of lead and lost 27 (since he had 336 left at the end of the school year). So, we can calculate how many more pieces of lead he had initially as follows:

Number of lead pieces initially = Total number of lead pieces - Number of lead pieces lost
= 601 - 27
= 574

Now, let's find out how many more gumballs he had initially:

Number of gumballs initially = Total number of gumballs - Number of gumballs lost
= 406 - 0
= 406

So, there were 406 more gumballs than lead pieces initially."
Response:  We know that Paul received 29 presents for his birthday and he lost or gave away 315 of them. So, we can calculate how many presents he actually had at the end of the school year as follows: Number of presents Paul had = Total number of presents - Number of presents given away or lost = 29 - 315 = -306 Therefore, Paul did not receive any oak leaves for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul has lost 231 olovki and given away 308 to his friends. So, the difference between what he gave away and what he lost is:  308 - 231 = 77. Therefore, Paul has given away more olovka than he has lost.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 457 gumballs and 320 rubber bands. If he didn't lose any gumballs during the school year, then he must have gained some from his friends or other sources. So let's assume that he gained x number of gumballs during the school year. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of gumballs = Initial amount + Amount gained (x)  Since Paul did not lose any gumballs, we can say that the amount gained is equal to the number of gumballs he received as gifts or otherwise: Number of gumballs = Initial amount + Amount gained (x) = 457 + x  Now, we are told that Paul ended up with 523 gumballs. This means that the amount gained (x) is equal to the difference between the final amount (523) and the initial amount (457): x = 523 - 457 = 66  Therefore, Paul gained 66 gumballs during the school year. As for the rubber bands, we know that he started with 320 and did not lose any, so he ended up with exactly the same number: 320 rubber bands.
Response:  At first, Konobor had 11 clients (mu≈°teriji). Then, some of them left, leaving him with 3 remaining clients. So, the number of clients that remained is 3 - 11 = -8. Therefore, there are 8 fewer clients than the original amount.
Response:  If Konobor had 3 mistresses and some of them left, he would have fewer than 4 mistresses remaining. We don't know how many exactly left, but let's assume that half of his original 3 mistresses (i.e., 1.5) left. So, after they left, he would have 2 x 1.5 = 3 mistresses remaining. Therefore, there are 3 more mistresses remaining than when they left.
Response:  At first, Konobor had x kupca. After 9 kupci left, he had x - 9 kupca. Now he has 12 kupca. So, we can write an equation: x = 12 - 9. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Konobor had 3 kupca at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Konobor had 14 musicians and he is left with 5 more musicians. So, in total, there are 14 + 5 = 19 musicians.
Response:  At first, Konobor had 13 clients (mu≈°teriji). Then, some of them left, so he had fewer clients. After that, he gained 4 new clients, which means he now has 4 + 13 = 17 clients in total. So, there are 17 - 9 = 8 clients remaining with Konobor.
Response:  We know that Konobor had initially 12 mice and then 15 cups of them went away. So, he has fewer mice now. Therefore, the number of mice he still has is equal to the initial amount minus the number of mice that left. In other words, we can write:  Number of mice = Initial number - Number of mice that left  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:  Number of mice = 12 - 15  Number of mice = -3  So, Konobor still has 3 mice!
Response:  If Konobor had 3 clients initially and then got some more, he had 8 clients in total (including both old and new ones). So, the number of new clients that came is equal to 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  At first, Konobor had 8 mastrers. Then some of them left, so he had 5 masters remaining. After that, he got 99 new clients, which means he now has 99 + 5 = 104 masters in total.
Response:  At first, Konobor had 12 clients (mu≈°teriji). Then some of them left, so he had fewer clients. After that, he got 10 new clients, which means he has now 14 clients in total (including both old and new ones). So, the answer is: 14.
Response:  At first, Dan had $3 dollars with him. Then he spent $2 dollars to buy a chocolate bar. So now he has $1 dollar left. Therefore, at the beginning, Dan had $3 dollars.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spent $3 on chocolate after buying it. So, how much did one piece of chocolate cost?  To find out, we can divide the amount of money Dan had ($4) by the number of pieces of chocolate he bought ($3).  Therefore, the cost of each piece of chocolate is:  Cost = $4 / $3 = $1.33  So, one piece of chocolate cost $1.33.
Response:  We have $4 and we buy 99 chocolates for $3 each, so we spend in total $297. Now, we are left with $263 - $297 = $64. So, there is $64 left over.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $4 each. So, in total, he spent $4 + $4 = $8. Therefore, the cost of one chocolate is $8 / 2 = $4.
"Response:  If he paid $2 for them and each one costs $3, then...

$2 / $3 = x
x = 6
So, Dan bought 6 chocolates."
Response:  We spent $2 for one bar of chocolate and $3 for another bar of chocolate. So we spent in total $5. Now we have $7 - $5 = $2 left over.
"Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys chocolate for $7 and chocolate for $6, then he spent a total of:
$7 + $6 = $13
So, Dan spent $13 on chocolate."
Response:  He spent $2 on chocolate that costs $6 and $3 on chocolate that costs $3. So he spent a total of: $$2 + $3 = $5$$ dollars on chocolate. Therefore, he spent $5 / $2 = $2.50 more on the cheaper chocolate than on the expensive one.
Response:  He spent $2 on chocolate and $3 on chocolate-covered chocolate. So he spent a total of $5 - $2 = $3 on chocolate-covered chocolate. Therefore, he spent more money on chocolate-covered chocolate than on regular chocolate.
Response:  First, Dan had $4. Then he bought a chocolate for $8, so now he has $4 - $8 = -$4. His friend gave him $5, so now he has $5 + (-$4) = $1. So, Dan has $1 left.
"Response:  If Dan had $3 with him after buying a chocolate bar, and he started with $4, then...

$4 - $3 = $1

So, the chocolate bar cost $1."
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 and he spent $3 for 10 chocolates. So, he had $4 - $3 = $1 left. Therefore, the answer is $1.
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $4 in total. So, each chocolate cost half of the remaining amount after buying them: $\$ \frac{4}{2} = \$2$. Therefore, each chocolate costs $2$.
Response:  He spent $3 on chocolate and $7 on candy. So he spent a total of $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, he spent more money on candy than on chocolate.
Response:  If he spent $4 on chocolate and $3 on chocolate-covered chocolate, then he spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7 on chocolate. So, he spent twice as much money on chocolate-covered chocolate than on regular chocolate. Therefore, he spent $7 / 2 = $3.50 on chocolate-covered chocolate.
Response:  If Paul had 115 books and sold 78 of them at a garage sale, then he has 37 remaining books (115 - 78 = 37).
"Response:  We know that after selling 137 books in the garage sale, he had 105 remaining. So, if he started with some number of books (let's call it x), then we can set up the equation:
x - 137 = 105
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 268
So, Paul had 268 books at the beginning."
"Response:  If Paul had 108 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he had fewer than 108 books left afterward. We are told that he gave 35 books to his friend, so he must have had 73 books remaining (108 - 35 = 73). Now we need to find out how many books he sold at the garage sale. The question states that he sold some books ""and gave away 35."" This means that he must have sold more than 35 books, since giving away 35 books would leave him with none. So let's assume he sold x books at the garage sale. Then he had 73 books remaining minus the number of books he sold, which is equal to the number of books he has now: 73 - x = 62. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Paul sold 9 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had 50 books initially and after buying them at a garage sale, he had 151 books in total. So, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows: Number of books bought = Total number of books - Initial number of booksTotal number of books - Initial number of books= 151-50= 101books He therefore bought 101 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had 2 books initially and then sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold half of his initial stock, which is 2/2 = 1 book. So, after selling one book, he had 2 - 1 = 1 book left. Now, he bought 150 new books, so he has 1 + 150 = 151 books in total now. Finally, we are told that he has 58 books, which means he sold 93 books (58 - 1 = 93).
Response:  If Paul had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he had fewer books than before. Let's assume that he sold half of his original 21 books, so he has 21 / 2 = 10 books left. Now, he bought 42 new books, which means he has 10 + 42 = 52 books in total. So, he sold more books than he bought. The difference between the number of books he sold (21) and the number he bought (42) is 21 - 42 = -21 books. Therefore, he sold more books than he bought.
Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. Let's assume he sold x books. Now, he has 71 - x books left. He then bought 38 new books, so now he has 71 - x + 38 = 116 books in total. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract x from both sides: x + 38 = 116. Solving for x, we get x = 45. So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pencils. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pencils left. So, to find out how many books he sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had: 108 - 66 = 42. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Pavle had initially 106 olovaka and after selling some of them at garage sale he had 82 olovaka left. So, we can calculate how many olovka he sold by subtracting the number of olovaka he had left from the initial amount:  Number of olovaka sold = Initial number of olovaka - Final number of olovaka  Number of olovaka sold = 106 - 82  = 24  Therefore, Pavle sold 24 olovaka at the garage sale.
"Response:  If Paul had 136 books at first and sold some of them in the garage sale, then he must have had fewer than 136 books left after the sale.  We know that he sold 27 books during the garage sale, so let's assume that he had x books left after selling those 27 books.  Since we are asked how many books Paul sold, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x - 27 = 109 (books left after sale)

Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of books Paul had before the garage sale. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 27:

x / 27 = 109 / 27

x = 4 (books Paul had before the garage sale)

Therefore, Paul sold 27 books during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books initially and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then we are told that he sold some of them at a garage sale, which reduced the number of books he had. The statement ""ostalo mu je 68 knjiga"" means that after selling some books at the garage sale, he was left with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is equal to 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since negative numbers cannot be sold, the correct answer is 0 books."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 books and 153 olive branches. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 olive branches. So, to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had: 95 - 13 = 82. Therefore, Paul sold 82 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Pavle had initially 42 olovka and 143 books. After selling some of his books at garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 olovaka. So, we can calculate how many olovki he sold by subtracting the number of olovaka he had after the garage sale from the initial number:  Number of olovki sold = Initial number of olovki - Number of olovika after garage sale = 42 - 19 = 23 olovki Therefore, Pavle sold 23 olovki at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Jessica has already picked 8 roses from her garden and put them in a vase. So, initially, there were 10 roses (the initial amount). Then, Jessica added 8 more roses to the vase, so now there are 18 roses in total (10 + 8 = 18). Therefore, the correct answer is 18 roses are in the vase right now.
Response:  At first, there were 16 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica added another 10 roses to the vase, so now there are 26 roses in total (16 + 10 = 26). Finally, she took 7 more roses from her garden and put them in the vase, leaving us with 23 roses in the vase at the end (26 - 7 = 23). Therefore, the number of roses in the vase at the beginning was 23.
"Response:  Jessica has already thrown away two rose petals, so there are 4 + 2 = 6 rose petals left in the vase. Then she picked some new roses from her garden and put them in the vase, making the total number of rose petals 6 + x, where x is the number of new rose petals she picked. Since she picked ""neke nove ru≈æe"" (some new roses), we can assume that x is not equal to zero. Therefore, the final number of rose petals in the vase is 6 + x = 23. So, x = 17."
Response:  Jessica has already thrown 33 roses into the vase and then she picked some new ones from her garden to add to the vase. So, in total, there are now 17 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses Jessica picked than she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw (33) from the total number of roses in the vase (17). Therefore, the answer is 16 - 33 = -17.
Response:  Jessica has thrown away 34 roses from the vase and then picked some new ones from her garden to add to the vase. Now there are 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than she put into the vase, we need to subtract the number of roses she added (15) from the number of roses she threw away (34): 34 - 15 = 19 So, Jessica threw away 19 more roses than she put into the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially seven roses in the vase and Jessica picked six more from her garden, which had a total of 59 roses. So, she has picked 6 + 59 = 65 roses so far. Now, there are 20 roses left in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica picked is equal to the number of roses left in the vase minus the initial number of roses in the vase, i.e., 65 - 7 = 58 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica picked another rose from her garden which had a total of 12 roses. So, the total number of roses she had was 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Now, we are told that there are 21 roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses left in the garden is 21 - 25 = -4 roses. Since negative numbers cannot be counted as answers, we can conclude that there are no roses left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 16 roses (15 + 1). Next, she picked more roses and orchids from the vase, so now she has 17 roses (16 + 1) and 96 orchids (62 + 34). Therefore, Jessica picked 1 rose from the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 13 roses (12 + 1). Next, she picked an orchid from the vase, leaving us with 12 roses and 19 orchids (12 + 12). Finally, she picked another orchid from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 21 (12 + 9). Therefore, Jessica picked 9 orchids from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 6 roses (including the one she picked) and still 3 orchids in the vase. Finally, she picked another rose from the vase, so now there are 7 roses (including the one she picked) and still 3 orchids in the vase. Therefore, there are more roses than orchids in the vase right now. The number of roses is 7, while the number of orchids is still 3, so the ratio of roses to orchids in the vase is 7:3.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 8 roses (7 + 1). Next, she picked an additional orchid from her garden, making it 9 orchids (12 - 3 = 9). Therefore, there are currently 8 roses and 9 orchids in the vase. So, the number of orchids exceeds the number of roses by 9 - 8 = 1.
Response:  If she had 3 rose in the vase before adding more, and now there are 19 roses in total, then we can calculate how many roses she added as follows: Number of roses she added = Total number of roses - Initial number of roses = 19 - 3 = 16 So, she added 16 roses to the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now she has 14 roses (including the one she already had). Next, she picked more orchids from her garden, bringing the total number of orchids to 91. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica picked is equal to the original number of roses minus the number of roses she already had, which is 13 - 1 = 12. So, Jessica picked 12 roses.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 orhideje and 16 ru≈æa in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 16 + 1 = 17 ru≈æe in the vase. Next, she picked an orchid from her garden as well, so now there are 3 + 1 = 4 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the final number of orhideje is 4, and the final number of ru≈æe is 17.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 7 roses (including the one she picked) and still 20 orchids in the vase. Finally, she picked another orchid from her garden, making it 8 orchids total in the vase. Therefore, there are currently 7 roses and 8 orchids in the vase. So, the number of roses is greater than the number of orchids in the vase.
Response:  We know that there were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked another rose from her garden, so now there are 10 roses (including the one she picked) and still 6 orchids in the vase. Finally, she added more orchids to the vase, making it have 13 orchids in total. Therefore, the number of orchids in the vase is greater than the number of roses, which means that there are 13 orchids and 4 roses (the initial amount plus the one Jessica picked). So, the correct answer is 13 - 4 = 9.
Response:  We know that Robinova kosa was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some hair. So let's call the original length of her hair L = 17 inches. Then we know that after cutting off some hair, her new length is L = x inches, where x is less than 17. Now, we are asked to find out how much hair she cut off. To do this, we can use the fact that the difference between two lengths is equal to the smaller length minus the larger length. In other words, if L1 - L2 = x, then L1 = L2 + x. Substituting L1 = 17 and L2 = x, we get: 17 - x = x + x. Simplifying, we get: 2x = 17. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8.5 inches. Therefore, Robinova cut off 8.5 inches of her hair.
Response:  Before shaving off 20 inches of her hair, Robin had 10 inches long hair. So, if she has now 10 inches long hair after shaving off 20 inches, then she must have had 30 inches (20 - 10 = 30) long hair before shaving.
Response:  The first statement says that Robinova kosa was 16 inches long and she took away 15 cm (which is equal to 15/2 = 7.5 inches). Then it says that she again grew by 12 inches. So, now her length is: 16 + 12 = 28 inches. Therefore, Robinova kosa is currently 28 inches long.
Response:  If Robinova kosa was originally 19 inches long and has grown an additional 18 inches, then her hair is now 37 inches long (19 + 18 = 37).
Response:  If Robin cut her hair and it was originally 14 inches long, then she has 13 inches of hair left after cutting. So, if she had 14 inches of hair to start with, she now has 13 - 13 = 0 inches of hair. Therefore, Robin does not have any hair left.
Response:  The original length of Robinova kosa was 14 inches. Then it grew by 8 inches, so its new length is 14 + 8 = 22 inches. Finally, she cut off 20 inches, so her current hair length is 22 - 20 = 2 inches. Therefore, Robinova kosa is currently 2 inches long.
"Response:  If Danny has 12 boxes in his collection and he found 53 bottle caps in the park, then we can calculate how many bottle caps Danny has overall as follows:

Total number of bottle caps = Number of bottle caps found in the park + Number of bottle caps in Danny's collection
= 53 + 12
= 65

Therefore, Danny has 65 bottle caps in total."
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 21 marbles from his collection and found some more in the park. So, the total number of marbles he found in the park is 21 + x, where x is the number of marbles he found in the park. Since there are 53 marbles in total, we can set up the equation: 21 + x = 53. Solving for x, we get: x = 32. Therefore, Danny found 32 marbles in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 63 pebbles in the park and threw away 51 old ones. So he has 33 pebbles left in his collection. To find out how many pebbles Danny had at the beginning, we can use the information that he threw away 51 old ones. Therefore, the number of pebbles Danny had at the beginning is equal to the number of pebbles he has now minus the number of pebbles he threw away. In this case, it is 33 - 51 = -18. So Danny did not have any pebbles at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 35 old coins and found 36 new ones in the park. So, he has 22 coins left in his collection after throwing away the old ones. Now, let's calculate how many more coins Danny found than he threw away:  Number of coins Danny found = Total number of coins he had - Number of coins he threw away  = 22 - 35 = -13  Therefore, Danny found fewer coins than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 coins in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So he has 42 coins left in his collection. To find out how many more coins Danny threw than those he found, we can subtract the number of coins he found from the total number of coins he had:  Number of coins thrown = Total number of coins - Number of coins found  In this case, the total number of coins Danny had was 42 (he had 30 coins he found + 12 coins he threw), and the number of coins he found was 30. Therefore, the number of coins Danny threw is:  Number of coins thrown = 42 - 30 = 12  So Danny threw 12 more coins than the ones he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 caps and 8 lids in the park. So he had 22 + 8 = 30 objects at first. Then, he collected 28 more caps and 63 more lids. Therefore, his final collection is 30 + 28 = 58 objects (caps and lids). So, Danny had 58 caps and 63 lids at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny had 30 omotaƒça in the park and he collected 57 more omotaƒça from his collection. So, initially, Danny had 30 + 57 = 87 omotaƒça.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 capsules and 14 labels in the park. So he has 7 capsules and 86 labels now in his collection. To find out how many more capsules Danny found than labels, we can subtract the number of labels from the total number of capsules:  Number of more capsules = Total number of capsules - Number of labels = 30 - 14 = 16 Therefore, Danny found 16 more capsules than labels in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 caps and 28 labels in the park. So he now has 68 bottle caps and 51 labels in his collection. To find out how many more labels than caps Danny found, we can subtract the number of labels from the total number of items he found:  Number of labels = Total number of items found - Number of caps  In this case, the total number of items found is 39 (11 + 28). Subtracting the number of caps gives us the number of labels found:  Number of labels = 39 - 11 = 28  Therefore, Danny found 28 more labels than caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny had 71 caps and 24 labels in the park. Now he has 28 caps for bottles and 16 labels in his collection. So, the total number of caps Danny has now is: 71 + 28 = 99. And the total number of labels Danny has now is: 24 + 16 = 40. Therefore, Danny has 99 caps and 40 labels in total.
Response:  We know that Danny has 27 poklopaca for bottles and 43 omotaƒça in his collection. So, he has a total of 27 + 43 = 70 items. Since he found 10 poklopaca and 62 packages in the park, he now has 70 - 10 = 60 items left. Therefore, Danny has 60 omotaƒça more than poklopaca.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 beads in the park and now has 25 beads left. So, initially he had 66 + 25 = 91 beads.
Response:  If Danny had 25 poklopaca in his collection before he found some more in the park, and now he has 32 poklopaca in his collection, then we can calculate how many additional poklopaca he found in the park as follows:  Additional poklopaca = New number of poklopaca - Original number of poklopaca = 32 - 25 = 7 Therefore, Danny found 7 more poklopaca in the park than he originally had in his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 58 new bottle caps while he was in the park and he already had 60 old bottle caps at home. So, the total number of bottle caps Danny has now is:  New + Old = 58 + 60 = 118  Therefore, Danny had 118 bottle caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 50 new marbles while he was in the park and he already had 6 old marbles before going to the park. So, his total number of marbles is now 50 + 6 = 56. Therefore, Danny has found 6 more marbles than he already had which means he has found 6 + 6 = 12 additional marbles.  So, Danny has found 12 more marbles in the park than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 48 new marbles and had 52 marbles in his collection before he started collecting them. So, the total number of marbles Danny has now is: 48 + 52 = 100 marbles. Therefore, Danny bacio more marbles than those he found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 82 packets and 29 caps in the park. He now has 42 caps for bottles and 61 Omotes in his collection. So he had 82 - 42 = 40 more caps at the beginning. Therefore, Danny had 40 + 29 = 69 caps at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny had 66 ambulances and 39 boxes in the park initially. Now he has 16 boxes with covers and 68 labels. So, we can calculate how many labels Danny had at first as follows: Number of labels = Total number of labels - Labels on boxes + Labels on ambulances = 68 - 39 + 66 = 57 Therefore, Danny had 57 labels at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 ambulances and 50 caps in the park. So he has 96 items (ambulances + caps). Now we are told that he has 21 caps left. Therefore, the number of caps he found is equal to the number of ambulances minus the number of caps he has left, which is 96 - 21 = 75. So Danny found 75 more caps than ambulances in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 ambulances and 5 caps in the park. Now he has 31 caps and 9 labels. So, we can calculate how many more ambulances Danny found than caps as follows: Number of ambulances found by Danny = 65 - 31 = 34 More ambulances were found by Danny than caps. Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 caps and 25 labels in the park. Now he has 11 labels and 12 caps. So, we can calculate how many more caps Danny has now as follows: Number of additional caps = Total number of caps - Initial number of caps = 12 - 58 = -46 To find out how many more labels Danny has, we need to subtract the initial number of labels from the current number of labels: Number of additional labels = Total number of labels - Initial number of labels = 11 - 25 = -14 Therefore, Danny has 46 fewer caps than ambulance and 14 fewer labels than ambulance.
Response:  We know that Danny had 15 bottle caps and 18 labels in the park. Now he has 67 labels and 35 bottle caps. So, we can write an equation:  Number of labels = 15 + 18 = 33  Number of bottle caps = 35 Therefore, Danny has 33 more labels than bottle caps.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer branches than Steve. So if Jake has 17 branches, then Steve must have 28 branches (17 + 11 = 28).
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 brains less than Steven, who has 14 more brain cells than Jill. So, if we subtract 7 from 14, we get 7. Therefore, Jake has 7 brain cells.
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 breasts less than Steven, who has 13 more breasts than Jill. So, if we subtract 18 from Jill's number of breasts, we get:  Jill has 27 breasts (13 + (-18) = 27).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer brains than Steven, who has more brains than Jill. So, if we compare Jake and Steven directly, Steven has 8 - 3 = 5 more brains than Jake. Now, let's consider Jake and Dijon (Jill). If Jake has 3 brains less than Jill, then Jill has 3 + 5 = 8 more brains than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 3 - 8 = -5 fewer brains than Dijon.
Response:  We know that Steven has 11 more than Jake and Jake has 12 less than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from Jake's number of breaks, we will get Steven's number of breaks. Therefore, Jill has 4 more breaks than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steve and 9 more apples than Jill. So, if Steve has x apples, Jake has x - 7 = 3 apples less. If Jill has y apples, then Jake has y + 9 = 12 apples more. Therefore, Jake has 12 + 3 = 15 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer apples than Steve and 8 more than Jill. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 7 = 3x / 2 apples. And if Jill has y apples, then Steve has 17 - y apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: 3x/2 + y = 17. Solving for y (the number of apples Jill has), we get y = 9. Therefore, Jill has 9 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer balls than Steven and 18 more than Jill. So, if we subtract 9 from Steven's number of balls (which is 16), we get: 16 - 9 = 7. Therefore, Steven has 7 more balls than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more biscuits than Jill. So if Jill has x biscuits, then Steven has x + 18 biscuits. Now we are told that Jake has 6 fewer biscuits than Steven. So if Steven has x + 18 biscuits, and Jake has x - 6 biscuits, then we can set up an equation: x + 18 = (x - 6) + 6. Solving for x, we get: x = 24. Therefore, Jake has 24 biscuits.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 5 breascovic than Steven. So if Steven has x breascovic, then Jake has x - 5 breascovic.  We also know that Steven has more than 18 breasclvic than Jill. So if Jill has y breasclvic, then Steven has y + 18 breasclvic. Finally we are told that Jake is less than Jill by 30 breasclvic. So if Jake has z breasclvic, then he is less than Jill by 30 - (z - y) breasclvic. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Jake is less than Jill by 30 - (x - y). Solving for x, we find that Jake has 56 breasclvic fewer than Jill.
Response:  We know that Steven has 15 more biscuits than Jake. So if Jake has x biscuits, then Steven has x + 15 = 30 biscuits. Now we are told that Jill has 12 fewer biscuits than Steve. So if Steve has 30 biscuits, and Jill has x - 12 = 18 biscuits. Therefore, Jake has 18 - 12 = 6 more biscuits than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer apples than Steve and 79 more oranges than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has x - 12 = 79 + 12 = 91 apples. Therefore, Jake has 91 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer apples than Steve and 3 more pears than Steve. So, if Steve has 9 apples and 8 pears, then Jake must have 6 (apples) - 13 = 7 apples and 3 + 8 = 11 pears. Therefore, Jake has 7 apples and 11 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer apples than Steve and 8 more pears than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and y pears, then Jake has x - 6 apples and y + 8 pears. Now we are given that Jake has 12 apples and 10 pears. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x = 12 and y = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 14 (since 12 + 6 = 18). So, Steven has 14 apples more than Jake. To find out how many more pears Steven has than Jake, we can use the same reasoning as before: since Jake has 10 pears and Steven has 10 + 8 = 18 pears, Steven has 8 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steve and 10 more oranges than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has 3x - 10 = 7 apples. Now we need to find out how many oranges Jake has. According to the question, Jake has 12 oranges, so he must have 12 + 7 = 19 oranges in total. Therefore, the number of oranges is greater than the number of apples.
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 breaks and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, we can say that Jake has x number of breaks. Since Steven has 67 more breaks than Jill, we can write an equation as follows:  Steven = Jill + 67  Substituting the value for Jake from the problem, we get:  Jake = Jill + 67 - 12  Solving for Jake, we find that he has 55 breaks. Therefore, the answer is 55.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 br...
Response:  We know that Jake is 12 brinks smaller than Steven and 72 bigger than Jill. So we can write an equation:  Jake = Steven - 12 + 72 (Jill)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Jake = 19 - 12 + 72 = 83  Therefore, Jake has 83 brinks.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer br...
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 jabukas and 10 less than Steve has brskvica. So, if Steve has 13 brskvic, then Jake must have 71 brskvic (84 - 10 = 74).
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 apples and 17 pears less than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jake has 13 - x apples. Similarly, we know that Steve has 8 bananas and 12 oranges. Therefore, Jake must have 8 + 12 = 20 oranges. Now, let's find out how many apples Jake has. Since he has 13 apples fewer than Steve, Jake has 20 - 13 = 7 apples. So, Jake has 7 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer apples than Steve and 10 more pears than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and y pears, then Jake has x - 8 = 2x apples and y + 10 = 3y pears. Now we can find out how many pears Steven has more or less than Jake:  Pears (Steven) = 3y - Pears (Jake) = 3(2) = 6 more pears than Jake. Therefore, Steven has 6 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer apples than Steve and more pears than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit collections directly, we can say that Jake has 4 jabuka (apples) more than Steve. Now, let's calculate how many jabuka Steve has:  Steve has 19 jabuka + 15 breskva = 34 jabuka (since breskva is not counted as an apple). Therefore, Jake has 4 jabuka more than 34 jabuka = 38 jabuka. So, the answer to your question is 38 jabuka.
Response:  If she had $78 and spent $15 in the supermarket, then she has $63 left ($78 - $15 = $63).
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and she had $33 left afterward, that means she started with $33 + $78 = $111. So, Olivia had $111 to begin with.
Response:  The initial amount of money was $100. She got $148 from ATMs, so now she has $248 ($100 + $148). Then, after visiting the supermarket, she spent $159, leaving her with $79 ($248 - $159). Therefore, she spent $79.
Response:  If she received $3 from an ATM and spent $49 at the supermarket, then her initial amount of money was $46 ($3 + $49). After visiting the supermarket, she had $49 left. So, she gained $7 more than what she spent at the supermarket (i.e., $49 - $42 = $7). Therefore, she sakupla $7 more than she spent at the supermarket.
Response:  Firstly, she received $53 from her novelty check and then got $91 from the ATM. So far, she has $144 ($53 + $91). Now, let's see how much she spent at the supermarket. According to the question, after visiting the supermarket, she had $14 left. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is equal to $144 minus $14 = $130.
Response:  If she had $106 initially and spent $49 in the exhibit hall, then her remaining balance after visiting the exhibit hall would be: $106 - $49 = $57. So, she spent $57 at the exhibit hall. Now, let's calculate how much she spent at the supermarket: $57 - $26 = $31. Therefore, she spent $31 at the supermarket.
"Response:  If there were originally $54 in the wallet and after visiting the supermarket, $29 remained, then we can calculate how much Olivia spent as follows:

$54 - $29 = $25
So, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket."
"Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and she had $128 in her wallet initially, then we can calculate how much money is left for her as follows:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, Olivia has $90 left in her wallet after buying groceries."
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and 5 were deleted, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had x applications on his phone. After deleting 18 of them, he was left with 5 applications. So, we can write an equation: x - 18 = 5. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 18 to both sides of the equation: x = 5 + 18. Simplifying, we get: x = 23. Therefore, Dave had 23 applications on his phone at the beginning.
Response:  At first, Dave had 10 applications on his phone. Then he added 11 new applications, so now he has 21 applications in total (10 + 11 = 21). After deleting some of them, he is left with 4 applications. Therefore, the number of applications Dave has after deletion is 4.
Response:  At first, Dave had 21 applications on his phone. Then he added 89 new applications, so now he has 89 + 21 = 106 applications on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 applications. So, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number he deleted is 106 - 24 = 82 applications. Therefore, Dave added 82 applications to his phone more than he deleted.
Response:  If Dave had 15 applications initially and added 71 new ones, then he has a total of 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). To find out how many more applications he added than he deleted, we need to subtract the number of applications he deleted from the total number of applications he added. So, if he deleted some applications, let's say he deleted 20 applications, then he has 86 - 20 = 66 applications left after deleting some apps. Therefore, he added 71 - 20 = 51 more applications than he deleted.
Response:  If Dave had 16 applications and 77 files before deleting some of them, that means he had 16 + 77 = 93 items in total.  After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, he deleted 88 (93 - 5) applications and files.
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 3 apps and 7 files. So, to find out how many files were deleted, we can subtract the number of files after from the number of files before:  Number of files deleted = 7 - 21 = -14 files.
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. So, the number of applications that remained after deletion is 21 - 15 = 6 more than the original amount. Similarly, the number of files that remained after deletion is 4 - 24 = -20 less than the original amount. Therefore, there are 6 more applications and -20 fewer files remaining on Dave's phone compared to the initial state.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. So, the number of files is greater than the number of applications. Therefore, there are more files (15) than applications (6).
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications before and then added another one, he now has 18 applications in total. So, he added 1 application to his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 59 files and applications before deleting some of them, that means he had 59 - 15 = 44 files and applications initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, the number of applications he deleted is equal to 12 - 5 = 7 applications.
Response:  If Dave had 24 files and applications before deleting some of them, that means he had 24 - 13 = 11 remaining files and applications after deleting some of them. So, he lost 2 files (11 - 9 = 2). Therefore, he deleted 2 files.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. So, the number of applications that were more than the number of files is: 12 - 5 = 7. Therefore, 7 more applications remained on Dave's phone after deleting some of them.
Response:  We know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting those apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. So, to find out how many more files than applications are left on his phone, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of files:  Number of files = Total number of files - Number of applications  In this case, the total number of files is 24, and the number of applications is 2, so:  Number of files = 24 - 2 = 22  Therefore, there are 22 more files than applications left on Dave's phone after he deleted some of them.
Response:  We know that Nell has 242 baseball cards and she gave 136 of them to Jeff. So, we can calculate how many cards Nell still has as follows:  Number of cards Nell still has = Total number of cards - Number of cards given away = 242 - 136 = 106 Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
Response:  If Nell has 301 cards and gives 154 to Jeff, then she had 147 cards left (301 - 154 = 147). So, Nell had 147 cards at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now than before. Let's call the number of cards she gave to Jeff x. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of cards Nell has = 528 - x ( since she gave some cards to Jeff) Now, we are told that after giving some cards to Jeff, Nell has 252 cards left. So, we can substitute this value into our equation: 528 - x = 252 Solving for x, we get: x = 276 Since Nell gave 276 cards to Jeff, the answer is 276.
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has fewer cards now than before. So, her new number of cards is less than 566.  Since Jeff started with 234 cards and got some from Nell, his new number of cards is greater than 234. Therefore, Jeff's current number of cards is 535 + x, where x is the difference between Nell's original number of cards (566) and her new number of cards (less than 566). Thus, x = 566 - 535 = 31. So, Jeff has 234 + 31 = 265 cards now.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has fewer than 309 - 3 = 296 baseball cards left. Then we are told that she also has 356 cards of the number 10. So in total, Nell has 296 + 356 = 652 cards. Since each card is worth 10 points, Nell now has 652 x 10 = 6520 points. Therefore, the answer is 6520.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 cards of other types, for a total of 458 cards.  She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 cards of other types.  To find out how many more 10-card packs Nell has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards:  495 - 404 = 91  So, Nell has 91 more 10-card packs than baseball cards.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and gave 195 to John. So she has 378 cards left. Now we are told that she gave some more cards to Jeff, but not many (just ""malo""). Therefore, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is less than 195. In fact, since she only gave 195 to John, it must be fewer than 195 - 195 = 0 cards. So, Nell did not give any cards to Jeff!"
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has fewer than 438 - (number of cards given to Jeff) baseball cards left.  Since she gave 18 cards of type 10 to Jeff, she now has 55 - 18 = 37 cards of type 10 remaining.  Therefore, Nell has 178 + 37 = 215 baseball cards in total.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has fewer than 239 - (number of cards given to Jeff) baseball cards left.  Since she also has 38 ten-dollar bills, we can conclude that she must have at least 38 + 10 = 48 ten-dollar bills. Therefore, the number of ten-dollar bills Nell has is 48.  As for the number of baseball cards, since she has 376 baseball cards in total, and 111 are baseball cards, we can deduce that she has 376 - 111 = 265 baseball cards remaining.
Response:  If Paco had 19 kolaƒça at first and then he ate some of them, that means he has less kolaƒça now. So, we can write an equation:  Paco had x kolaƒça at first, where x is the number of kolaƒça he had initially. Now, he has 35 - 19 = 16 kolaƒça left. Therefore, the value of x is 19.
Response:  If Paco had 28 kolaƒçiƒáa and he ate some of them, then he has less than 28 kolaƒçica left. We don't know how many he ate, but let's assume he ate half of them (14). So, now Paco has 28 - 14 = 14 kolaƒçica left. And if he ate 7 of those remaining kolaƒçica, then he has 14 - 7 = 7 kolaƒçica left. Therefore, Paco pojeo 7 kolaƒçiƒáa.
Response:  At first, Paco had 40 kolaƒçiƒáa. Then he ate two kolaƒçiƒáa, so he had 40 - 2 = 38 kolaƒçiƒáa left. After that, he bought 37 more kolaƒçiƒáa, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 kolaƒçiƒáa in total. Therefore, Paco had 75 kolaƒçiƒáa at the end.
Response:  Paco had 25 kolaƒçiƒáa and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 kolaƒçiƒáa left. Then, he bought 3 more kolaƒçiƒáa. So, now he has 20 + 3 = 23 kolaƒçiƒáa in total. Therefore, he ate more than he bought.
Response:  Paco had 13 kolaƒçiƒáa and he ate 2. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 more kolaƒçiƒáa. So, his total amount of kolaƒçiƒáa is 11 + 36 = 47. Therefore, he bought more than he ate.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Then, he gave 13 to his friends, so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 cookies left. Therefore, there are 22 cookies left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 17 kolaƒçiƒáa and he ate 14 of them. So, he has 17 - 14 = 3 more kolaƒçiƒáa left. Then, he gave 13 to his friend. So, now he has 3 + 13 = 16 kolaƒçiƒáa left. Therefore, he ate more kolaƒçiƒáa than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and ate 16 of them, leaving him with 12 - 16 = 4 remaining cookies. He then gave 21 of his remaining cookies to his friend. So, the number of cookies he gave away is 21. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies he ate (16) and the number of cookies he gave away (21) is 16 - 21 = -5.
Response:  Paco had initially 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies. To find out how many cookies are left for Paco, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the initial total number of cookies he had. So, the number of cookies left for Paco is:  Initially, Paco had 22 + 75 = 97 cookies. After eating some, he has 97 - (15 x 2) = 97 - 30 = 67 cookies left. Therefore, there are 67 cookies left for Paco.
Response:  We know that Paco had 9 sweet rolls and 6 salty rolls to start with. He then ate 36 sweet rolls and 3 salty rolls. So, if he ate 36 sweet rolls, he must have started with at least 36 - 9 = 27 sweet rolls left. Similarly, since he ate 3 salty rolls, he must have started with at least 6 - 3 = 3 salty rolls left. Therefore, Paco had 27 + 3 = 30 salty rolls in total.
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. So, he has eaten a total of 3 + 2 = 5 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty cookies. To do this, we can subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies he had: 37 - 2 = 35 sweet cookies left. Therefore, Paco ate 5 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially. He ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies afterward. To find out how many more salty cookies he ate than sweet ones, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salty cookies he had:  Number of salty cookies Paco had initially = 6  Number of sweet cookies Paco ate = 20  Total number of salty cookies Paco had after eating = initial amount + number of sweet cookies he ate = 6 + 20 = 26  So, Paco ate 6 more salty cookies than sweet ones.
Response:  If Paco had 37 kolaƒçiƒáa at the beginning and he ate 36 of them, then he has one less kolaƒçiƒá than before. So, Paco has 36 kolaƒçiƒáa left.
Response:  Paco had 36 kolaƒçiƒáa and gave 14 to his friend. So, he had 36 - 14 = 22 kolaƒçiƒáa left. Then, he ate 10 of them. Therefore, there are 22 - 10 = 12 kolaƒçiƒáa left for Paco.
Response:  Paco had 41 kolaƒçiƒá and gave 9 to his friend. So he has 32 left (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 more kolaƒçiƒá. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolaƒçiƒá he had after giving some to his friend and the number he ate is equal to the number he gave away: 32 - 9 = 23. So, Paco ate 23 more kolaƒçiƒá than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 6 cookies and gave his friend 30 cookies. So, he gave his friend 30 - 6 = 24 more cookies than he had. Then, he ate 23 of them. Therefore, the number of cookies that he gave to his friend is equal to 24 - 23 = 1 more cookie.  Hence, he gave his friend 1 more cookie than he ate.
Response:  At first, Paco had 97 + 34 = 131 kolaƒçiƒáa in total. Then he ate 15 slatki kolaƒçi and 56 salty kolaƒçi. So, after eating, he has 131 - 15 = 116 kolaƒçiƒáa left (slaty).
Response:  We know that Paco had 26 slanih kolaƒçiƒáa initially. After eating some of them, he had 14 slatki kolaƒçi and 9 slanih kolaƒçica remaining. So, we can calculate how many slanih kolaƒçiƒáa Paco had at first as follows: Total number of slanih kolaƒçiƒáa = Initial amount - Amount eaten = 26 - (14 + 9) = 8 Therefore, Paco had 8 slanih kolaƒçiƒáa initially.
Response:  If Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies, that means he had a total of 45 cookies (39 + 6 = 45). Then, if he ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies, it means he left with 12 salty cookies (45 - 23 = 22) and 32 sweet cookies (45 - 32 = 13). So, the number of more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty ones is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, Paco ate 7 more sweet cookies than salty ones.
Response:  Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. The difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate is 3 (28 - 15). Therefore, he ate 3 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  If she received $7 and spent some money, then she has $5 left. So, she must have spent half of the amount she received, which is $3.50. Therefore, she spent $3.50.
Response:  If Gwen received $10 for her birthday and she spent $8 of it, then she has $6 left. So, Gwen received $10 = 6 + 4 (the amount she spent).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mom and then she got another $4 from her dad. So, in total, she has $6. Now, if she spent $3, then she will have $6 - $3 = $3 left with her. Therefore, the correct answer is $3.
Response:  If Za got $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, then she has a total of $13 ($8 + $5).  If she spent $4, that means she has $9 left ($13 - $4). So, Za got more money from her mom than from her dad.
Response:  If Za got $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad, then she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6).  If she spent $4, that means she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. So, Za got more money from her dad than from her mom.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Za received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. So, in total, she has $12 ($5 + $7). Now, we are told that she spent $4. Therefore, the amount of money she received from her mother is equal to the amount she spent minus the amount she received from her father. In other words, $7 - $4 = $3. So, Za received more money from her mother than from her father.
Response:  If Za got $5 from her father and her mother gave her an additional $2, then she has a total of $7.  Now, if she spent $6, that means she has $1 left with her. So, Za received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 marbles in his collection and lost some of them, then he has fewer than 9 marbles now. We don't know how many marbles he lost, but we can call that number x. So, if Josh has 4 marbles left, then x = 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had n kuglica in his collection and lost 21 kuglica, then he has n - 21 kuglica left. Since he now has 12 kuglica, we can set up an equation: n = 12 + 21. Solving for n, we get: n = 33. Therefore, Josh had 33 kuglica in his collection before losing any.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 marbles and found 5 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of marbles he lost (11) from the total number of marbles he had at first (19), we get: 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, Josh has 8 marbles left in his collection now.
Response:  If Josh had 4 marbles in his collection and lost 16 marbles, then he has lost 16 - 4 = 12 marbles. But if he found 8 new marbles, that means he gained 8 - 12 = -4 marbles. So, he actually lost more marbles than he found. Therefore, the answer is -4 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 7 marbles in his collection and lost 8 of them, then he had 7 - 8 = -1 marble left.  Then, he found 10 new marbles, so he gained 10 + 1 = 11 marbles in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles he found (11) and the number he lost (-1) is equal to 10 marbles.
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles in his collection and found 7 of them, then he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left in his collection. So, he has 14 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh had 20 marbles in his collection and gave 2 to Jack, then he has 18 marbles left. So, Josh has 18 marbles now.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 kuglica in his collection. Then, Jack gave him 20 more kuglica, so now he has 42 kuglica (22 + 20).
Response:  If Josh had 19 balls in his collection earlier and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 balls left (19 - 11 = 8). So, he has 8 balls now.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 bullets in his collection. Then he found 13 shells and lost 5 shells. So, if we calculate it, Josh has 22 - 13 = 9 remaining bullets.
Response:  If Josh had 15 marbles in his collection and found 9 more, then he has a total of 15 + 9 = 24 marbles now. However, if he lost 23 marbles, then he is left with 24 - 23 = 1 marble only. So, Josh lost 23 marbles more than he found.
Response:  If Josh had 3 marbles in his collection and found 6 pebbles, then he now has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles. However, if he lost 5 marbles, then he only has 9 - 5 = 4 marbles left. So, he gained 4 more marbles than he lost.
Response:  If Marko and his father together collected 4 funts of heavy jagodes, then each of them has collected half of that amount (2 funta). Since Marko is heavier than his father by 5 funta (19 - 14 = 5), it means that Marko's jagodes are heavier than his father's by an additional 5 funta (5 + 2 = 7). Therefore, Marko's jagodes weigh 7 funta more than his father's jagodes.
Response:  We know that Marko and his dad went to gather apples together, and their combined weight of apples is 35 pounds (funti). Since Marko has an apple weighing 13 pounds, then his father must have had the remaining 22 pounds of apples (35 - 13 = 22). Therefore, Marko's father's apples were twice as heavy as Marko's.
Response:  We know that Marko and his father together collected 37 pounds of fruit (20 + 17 = 37). Since Marko alone picked up 20 pounds of fruit, we can calculate the weight of each of his jagades as follows:  $Weight$ of $Marko's$ jagodes = $\frac{Total$ weight$ of$ fruit}{Number}$ of $jagodes$  $= \frac{37}{20} = 1.85$ pounds per jagod $ $ Therefore, Marko's jagodes are approximately 1.85 pounds each.
"Response: 
Marko has 8 pounds of jagodes (funti), and his father has 32 pounds of jagodes (funate). So together they have 8 + 32 = 40 pounds of jagodes."
Response:  If Marko and his father together collected jagodes that are heavy about 7 kg, then Marko has lost 5 kg of those jagodes during their journey back home. So, now he has only 2 kg of jagodes left. Therefore, the weight of jagodes that Marko's father had was 7 - 5 = 2 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko and his father together collected jagodes which are heavy around 10 kilograms. Then, when they were returning home, Marko's father lost 5 kilograms of jagodes. So now, Marko has 2 kilograms of jagodes left. To find out how much jagodes Marko's father had initially, we can multiply the total weight of jagodes they collected by the proportion that Marko had after his father lost some jagodes. Therefore, if Marko had 2 kilograms of jagodes left, then his father must have had 10 - 5 = 5 kilograms of jagodes initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marko and his father together collected 54 kg of apples (22 kg + 30 funti). Then, we are told that Marko had 36 funti of apples after his father found more. So, the total weight of apples that Marko now has is 36 funti x 11 = 396 kg. Therefore, the weight of apples that Marko's father found is 54 kg - 396 kg = -342 kg. Since this is a negative value, it means that Marko's father did not find any apples.
Response:  We know that Marko has 5 kg of jagodes and together they weigh 37 pounds or 16 kilograms (since there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram). So, if Marko has 5 kg of jagodes, then his father must have had 16 - 5 = 11 kg of jagodes.
"Response:  If Marko and his father together have collected 17 pounds of berries (Marko has 30-pound apples), then Marko's berries must weigh less than that amount. So, if Marko's berries weighed x pounds, then their total weight would be 17 + x pounds. Since Marko's berries alone weigh 30 pounds, we can set up the equation:

x = 17 - 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = -13

So, Marko's berries are 13 pounds heavier than his father's berries."
Response:  If Marko and his dad together have collected jars that weigh 26 pounds (fruits), then Marko must have had 26/2 = 13 pounds of fruit alone. Since Marko has a 10-pound apple, he must have had 13 - 10 = 3 pounds of other types of fruit. Therefore, Tatas must have had 26 - 3 = 23 pounds of fruit.
"Response:  We know that Marko and his father together have collected 30 pounds of jagod...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that Marko and his father together have collected 30 pounds of jagods (which is equal to 13.6 kilograms). Since Marko's father's jagodes are heavy as 5 kilograms each, then the total weight of Marko's jagodes would be:

Marko's jagodes = Total weight of jagods x Number of Marko's jagodes / Total number of jagods
= 13.6 kg x 2 / 4 = 8.8 kg

Therefore, Marko's jagodes weigh 8.8 kilograms."
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus (the initial condition). Then, more children entered the bus at the station (the change in conditions). So, now there are 10 children in the bus. To find out how many more children are in the bus than before, we need to subtract the number of children initially from the current number of children:  Number of children in the bus now - Number of children initially = 10 - 2 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more children in the bus now than there were before.
Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children in the bus and another 38 children at the station who boarded the bus. So, in total, we have 26 + 38 = 64 children now in the bus.
Response:  We know that initially there were some children in the bus and then two more joined them at the bus stop. So, the total number of children in the bus before it stopped was:  Initially = Number of children + Number of new children =  x + 2 = 41 - 2 = 39 Children. Therefore, there were 39 children in the bus before it stopped.
Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus station (we don't know how many). So, the number of children left in the bus is 21. Therefore, the answer is 21 - 43 = -22.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the station (we don't know how many). So, the number of children left in the bus is 41 - however many got off. Now we are told that there are 18 children left in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off at the station is 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 21 children went to school in the bus and then 10 of them got off at the bus station. So, initially there were 21 - 10 = 11 children left in the bus. Then, some more children boarded the bus at the bus station, but we don't know how many exactly. Therefore, we can say that the total number of children who entered the bus after getting off at the bus station is unknown (let's call it x). Now, let's calculate the total number of children inside the bus when it arrived at the school: Total no. of chilren inside the bus = Initial no. of children + Number of children who entered the bus after getting off at the bus station Total no. of children inside the bus = 11 + x We are given that there were 16 children inside the bus when it arrived at the school, so we can set up the equation: 11 + x = 16 Now, solve for x: x = 5 So, there were 5 children who boarded the bus at the bus station.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 14 children in the bus and then 6 more got off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus after they left is: 14 - 6 = 8. Therefore, the number of children who entered the bus is: 8 - 14 = -6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and then 68 children got off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus was 36 + 68 = 104. Now, some more children entered the bus, so the final number of children inside the bus is 12 + 104 = 116. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who entered the bus is 116 - 104 = 12.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 22 children in the bus and 40 children got off at the station. So, the number of children who remained in the bus is: 22 - 40 = -18. Now, we are told that some children got off from the bus and some entered it. Therefore, the total number of children inside the bus after some got off is: -18 + 2 = -16. Thus, the number of children who exited the bus at the station is: -16 - 2 = -18.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children got into the bus while some got off. So, the total number of children in the bus at any given time is equal to the initial number minus the number who got off. Therefore, the number of more children who entered the bus than those who got off can be calculated as follows: Number of more children = Total number of children in the bus at any given time - Initial number of children in the bus = 30 - 28 = 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 23 people who got off the bus at the station and then 24 people boarded the bus while some got off. So, in total, there are 23 + 24 = 47 people inside the bus. Now, we need to find out how many more people got off than boarded the bus. To do this, we can subtract the number of people who got off from the number of people who boarded the bus: 47 - 24 = 23. Therefore, 23 more people got off the bus than boarded it.
Response:  If Peƒáar has made 133 kolaƒçi and he sold 51 of them, then we know that he still has 82 kolaƒçi left (133 - 51 = 82). Now, let's assume that Baker has also made some kolaƒçi. We don't know how many exactly, but we can say that Baker has made more than Peƒáar because he sold 51 kolaƒçi more than Peƒáar did. So, if Baker has made x kolaƒçi, then he must have sold at least 51 + x kolaƒçi. Since Peƒáar has 82 kolaƒçi left after selling 51, it means that Baker has sold at most 82 - 51 = 31 kolaƒçi more than Peƒáar. Therefore, the difference between the number of kolaƒçi Baker has made and the number of kolaƒçi Peƒáar has made is equal to 31. In other words, Baker has made 31 + x = 164 kolaƒçi (since Peƒáar has made 133 kolaƒçi). So, Baker has made at least 164 - 133 = 31 more kolaƒçi than Peƒáar.
Response:  If Pecivac made 54 kolaƒça and sold some of them, then he has 13 kolaƒça left. So, if he sold x kolaƒça, then he has 13 - x kolaƒça left. We can write an equation based on this:  Number of kolaƒça Pecivac has = 13 - x Where x is the number of kolaƒça that Pecivac sold. Now we need to find out how many kolaƒça Pecivac sold in order to determine the value of x. To do this, we will use the information given in the question that Pecivac sold some of his kolaƒçi. This means that the number of kolaƒça he has left (13) is less than the total number of kolaƒça he made (54). So, we can set up another equation: 54 > 13 + x Which means that the number of kolaƒça Pecivac sold is equal to the difference between the total number of kolaƒça he made and the number of kolaƒça he has left: x = 41 Therefore, Pecivac sold 41 kolaƒça.
Response:  If he sold 145 pieces of cake and has 72 left over, that means he made 72 + 145 = 217 pieces of cake in total. So, he made 217 cakes.
Response:  If Pecivac made 155 kolaƒça and his friend bought 140 from him, then he still has 15 - 14 = 1 kolaƒç left. So, Baker still has 1 kolaƒç.
Response:  If he made 121 cookies and sold 105 of them, that means he has 16 (121 - 105) extra cookies left over. Then, if he bought 170 new cookies, it means he now has 34 (16 + 170) total cookies left. So, there are 34 cookies still left with the peka
Response:  If pecivac made 13 cakes and sold 91 of them, that means he has 40 left (13 - 91 = 40). Then, if he bought 154 new tarts, it means he has 114 more than he had before (154 - 40 = 114). So, the number of additional cakes he bought is equal to the number of cakes he had before minus the number of cakes he sold, which is 114 - 40 = 74. Therefore, pecivac bought 74 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  If he sold 170 kolaƒçi and bought 31 new ones, then he has 149 old kolaƒçi left (170 - 31 = 149).  He also sold 78 kolaƒçi, so he has 78 - 149 = -71 kolaƒçi left after selling them. Therefore, he sold more kolaƒçi than he bought. The difference between the number of kolaƒçi he sold and the number he bought is 78 - 31 = 47 kolaƒçi. So, he sold 47 more kolaƒçi than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 110 cookies and sold 75 pieces of them. Then he made another 76 cookies. So, in total, the baker has 110 + 76 = 186 cookies left.
Response:  The pastry chef made 144 cookies and sold 71 pieces. Then he made another 111 cookies. So in total, the pastry chef made 255 cookies (144 + 111). Therefore, the number of more cookies that the pastry chef made than those he sold is 255 - 71 = 184 cookies.
Response:  If Peƒáar made 149 kolaƒça and 91 peciva, then he sold 10 kolaƒça and 90 peciva. So, if we subtract these numbers from the total number of kolaƒçi and peciva that Peƒáar made, we will know how many kolaƒçi and peciva Baker has. Therefore, Baker has 139 kolaƒça (149 - 10) and 81 peciva (91 - 90).
Response:  If he sold 15 kolaƒça and 103 peciva, then he has fewer peciva than before. So, if he had x peciva before, now he has x - 103 peciva. Therefore, he still has 7 kolaƒça (since he didn't sell any). So, the number of peciva he has left is: x - 103 = 7. Therefore, he has 63 peciva left (x = 73).
Response:  We know that Peƒáar has made more kolaƒçi than peciva. So, if he sold 115 kolaƒçi and 81 peciva, then he must have had more kolaƒçi than peciva at first. Therefore, the number of kolaƒçi that Peƒáar made is greater than 81. Since we are asked how many more kolaƒçi he made, let's call this difference x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of kolaƒçi made by Peƒáar = 126 - x Number of peciva made by Peƒáar = 48 Now, according to the question, Peƒáar sold 115 kolaƒçi and 81 peciva. Substituting these values into our equations gives us: Number of kolaƒçi sold by Peƒáar = 126 - x Number of peciva sold by Peƒáar = 81 Solving for x (the difference between the number of kolaƒçi made and the number of peciva made), we get: x = 35 (Since 126 - 35 = 91, which is greater than 81.) Therefore, Peƒáar made 35 more kolaƒçi than he did peciva.
Response:  We know that Peƒáar has made 19 kolaƒça and 131 peciva in total. If he sold 70 kolaƒça and 88 peciva, then we can calculate how many more peciva than kolaƒça he made as follows: Number of peciva - number of kolaƒçi = 88-19=69 So, Peƒáar made 69 more peciva than kolaƒça.
Response:  According to the question, Pekar made 157 kolaƒça and 169 peciva. If he sold 158 kolaƒça and 147 peciva, then he sold more kolaƒça than peciva. So, the number of kolaƒça that Pekar sold is greater than the number of peciva he sold by 9 (158 - 147 = 9). Therefore, Pekar sold 9 more kolaƒça than peciva.
"Response:  If Pecivac made 54 kolaƒçi and 143 peciva, then he sold x kolaƒça and y peciva. Since he sold more peciva than kolaƒçi, we know that x < 54. Also, since he sold 68 kolaƒçi and 92 peciva, we can write:
x + y = 68... (1)
y > 0... (2)
Now, let's solve for y in equation (2):
y = 92 - x... (3)
Substituting equation (3) into equation (1), we get:
x + (92 - x) = 68... (4)
Simplifying equation (4), we get:
2x = 30
x = 15
So, Pecivac sold 15 kolaƒçi and 97 peciva more than he made."
Response:  If PeciVac has sold 44 kolaƒça and he made 48 kolaƒça in the beginning, then we can calculate how many kolaƒça he has left to sell as follows: Number of kolaƒça PeciVac has left to sell = Total number of kolaƒça he made - Number of kolaƒça he sold = 48 - 44 = 4 So, PeciVac has 4 kolaƒça left to sell.
Response:  If he initially made 40 cookies and sold 8 of them, then he has 32 remaining cookies (40 - 8 = 32). So, he produced more than the number of cookies he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies he produced and the number of cookies he sold is 32 - 8 = 24.
"Response:  If Peƒáarov's friend bought 137 kolaƒça from him and he made 169 kolaƒça to start with, then we can calculate how many kolaƒça Peƒáarov has left as follows:

Let X be the number of kolaƒça that Peƒáarov had at the beginning (i.e., before his friend bought any). Since Peƒáarov made 169 kolaƒça more afterward, the total number of kolaƒça he now has is:
X + (169 - 137) = X + 32

Therefore, Peƒáarov currently has 32 kolaƒça."
Response:  If he made 173 kolaƒçi and bought 103 new tarts, that means he has 70 kolaƒçi left (173 - 103 = 70). Then, if he sold 86 torts, he has 44 kolaƒçi left (70 - 86 = 44). So, Peka still has 44 kolaƒçi left.
Response:  If pecivac made 99 kolaƒça and bought 167 new ones, that means he has a total of 266 kolaƒça (99 + 167). Then, if he sold 89 kolaƒça, he has left with 177 kolaƒça (266 - 89). So, he bought more kolaƒça than he sold. Therefore, the answer is 177.
Response:  If he made 8 kolaƒça and bought 139 new ones, that means he has a total of 147 kolaƒça (8 + 139). Then, if he sold 145 kolaƒça, it means he has 2 kolaƒça left (147 - 145 = 2). So, he prodao more kolaƒça than he kupio.
Response:  If PeciVac made 62 kolaƒça first and then made another 149 kolaƒça, that means he has a total of 211 kolaƒça (62 + 149). Then, if he sold 144 pieces, that leaves him with 67 kolaƒça left (211 - 144 = 67). So, PeciVac still has 67 kolaƒça left to bake.
"Response:  The baker made 81 rolls first and then made another 92 rolls. He sold 46 packages of rolls. So, the number of rolls he made more than those he sold is:

$$ \text {Number of rolls made more than sold} = \text{Total number of rolls made - Total number of rolls sold} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Number of rolls made more than sold} &= 81 + 92 - 46 \\ &= 53 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, the baker made $53$ more rolls than those he sold."
Response:  We know that Peƒáar has made 61 kolaƒç and 167 kolaƒça. If he sold 108 kolaƒça, then he must have had 61 + 167 = 228 kolaƒça left. Now, we are asked how many kolaƒça Baker would have if Peƒáar gave him 44 peciva (pieces of bread). To find out, we need to divide the number of kolaƒça Peƒáar gave Baker by the number of pieces of bread he received:  Number of kolaƒça Baker has = Number of pieces of bread √ó Amount of kolaƒça in each piece of bread  Therefore, the answer is:  Number of kolaƒça Baker has = 228 kolaƒça / 44 peciva = 5 kolaƒça
Response:  If he sold 104 kolaƒçi and 29 peciva, then he has left with x peciva. Since he made 56 peciva in total, we can write an equation:  x + 56 = 124 (since he had 124 peciva at first). Solving for x, we get: x = 70. So, Peƒáar still has 70 peciva left.
Response:  We know that Pecivac has made 52 pies and 84 cookies. If he sold 102 cookies and 94 pies, then we can calculate how many more cookies he sold than pies as follows: Number of cookies sold = 102 Cookies sold = Number of pies sold + Number of cookies sold - Number of pies made Number of pies sold = 94 (Since he made 52 pies) Number of cookies sold = 102 - 52 = 50 Therefore, Pecivac sold 50 more cookies than pies.
Response:  We know that Peƒáar has made more pecives than kolaƒça (134 peciva and 11 kolaƒça). So if he sold 140 kolaƒça and 92 peciva, then he must have sold some of his own peciva as well. To find out how many peciva he sold, we can subtract the number of peciva he had from the total number of peciva he sold: 140 - 134 = 6. Therefore, Peƒáar sold 6 peciva in addition to the 11 kolaƒça he already had. Now let's check whether he sold more kolaƒça or peciva:  Kolaƒçi: 11 + 6 = 17 Kolachi: 140 - 134 = 6 Pecvi: 11 + 6 = 17 Since Peƒáar sold more kolaƒça than peciva, he must have made more peciva than kolaƒça. The difference between the number of peciva he made and the number of kolaƒça he sold is equal to the number of peciva he sold: 134 - 6 = 128. Therefore, Peƒáar made 128 peciva and sold 6 peciva in addition to the 11 kolaƒça he already had.
Response:  We know that Peƒáar has made 14 kolaƒçi and 153 peciva. If he sold 8 kolaƒçi, then he had 6 kolaƒçi left (14 - 8 = 6). Now we need to find out how many more kolaƒçi he has than the number of kolaƒçi he sold. So, if he sold 8 kolaƒçi, then he has 6 kolaƒçi + 8 kolaƒçi = 14 kolaƒçi more than the number of kolaƒçi he sold. Therefore, Peƒáar has 14 more kolaƒçi than the number of kolaƒçi he sold.
Response:  We know that Peƒáar made 43 kolaƒça and 114 peciva. If he sold 154 kolaƒça, then he must have had more than 43 kolaƒça left over to sell. So, the number of kolaƒça Peƒáar has is: 43 + (154 - 43) = 90 kolaƒça.  Therefore, Peƒáar has 90 kolaƒça more than he sold.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to have at least 140 play sessions, we can calculate how many games she needs to buy as follows:

Number of games = Total number of play sessions / Number of games per session
= 140 / 2 (since each game can be played twice)
= 70

Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 70 more games to reach her target of 140 play sessions."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she decides to give away 64 of them, then she will have 42 remaining (106 - 64 = 42).
Response:  If Kelly had 91 Nintendo games at first and she played 92 matches, then initially she must have had x games = 92 - 91 = 1 game. So, Kelly had 1 game at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly needs to have in order to have 12 Nintendo games, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she currently has (20) by the number of Nintendo games she wants to have (12). So, Kelly needs to have 20/12 = 16 Nintendo games.
"Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to give up in order to have exactly 31 Sony games, we can divide the number of Sony games she has (132) by the number of Sony games she wants to have (31):

132 / 31 = 4

So, Kelly needs to give up 4 Sony games in order to have exactly 31 Sony games."
Response:  If Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 more, then she now has a total of 111 games. To find out how many she will have left after giving away 6 games, we can subtract 6 from 111: 111 - 6 = 105. So, Kelly will have 105 Nintendo games left after giving away 6 games.
Response:  If Randy has 52 blocks and he uses them to build a cube (which is 6 blocks long on each side), then at first, he had 52 - 6 = 46 blocks left.
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he used x blocks for the tower, then we can write an equation: 97 = x + 72. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, subtract 72 from both sides of the equation: 97 - 72 = x. Solving for x gives us: x = 25. So Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total and he used 14 blocks to build the tower. So, the number of blocks left for building the house is:

79 - 14 = 65 blocks

Therefore, there are 65 blocks remaining after building the tower and the house."
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 blocks in total and he used 27 blocks to build the tower. So, the number of blocks left is: 58 - 27 = 31. Now we need to find out how many blocks Randy used to build the house. According to the question, Randy used 53 blocks to build the house. Therefore, the number of blocks Randy used to build both the tower and the house is: 31 + 53 = 84.
Response:  To build a tower, he used 37 blocks and to build a house, he used 33 blocks. So, we can say that for every block he used to build the tower, he used 0.95 blocks (37/33) to build the house. Therefore, he used 0.95 x 13 = 12.65 blocks more to build the house than the tower.
Response:  To build a tower (toranj), Randy used 79 blocks. To build a house (kuƒáa), he used 82 blocks more than for building the tower. So, to build the house, Randy used 82 + 79 = 161 blocks in total. Therefore, Randy used 161 - 79 = 82 blocks more to build the house than to build the tower.
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks to build a tower and he uses all of them, then he will have used up all his blocks. So, if he had 59 blocks in total, that means he had 23 blocks left over after building the tower (59 - 36 = 23).
Response:  To build a house with 20 blocks and a tower with 50 blocks, we need to know how many blocks are in each structure.  We can assume that one block is equal to one unit of measurement (e.g., meter).  Therefore, if we have 20 blocks for the house, it means that the house will be 20 meters long. Similarly, if we have 50 blocks for the tower, it means that the tower will be 50 meters high.  Now, let's compare the height of the tower to the length of the house. The ratio of the height of the tower to the length of the house is 50:20 = 2:1. This means that the tower is twice as tall as the house.  So, to answer your question, Randy used more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house. Specifically, Randy used 50 - 20 = 30 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks in total and he used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower (kula). So we can write an equation:  Number of blocks used for the house = 89 And number of blocks used for the tower = 63 Now we want to find out how many more blocks were used to build the house than to build the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house:  Difference between number of blocks used for the house and the tower = 89 - 63 = 26 Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than to build the tower.
"Response:  If you have read 20 books in a series called ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", and you want to know how many of them you have already read, we can calculate it as follows:  You have already read 5 books (according to your statement). So, the number of books you have not yet read is: 20 - 5 = 15."
Response:  If you have read 13 books in the series and still have 8 more to go, then there are a total of 21 books in the series.
"Response:  If you have read 12 books in the series ""Ludna glupa ≈°kola"" and watched 56 films based on those books, then you still need to read 44 more books (56 - 12 = 44)."
Response:  If you have read 19 books in the series and watched 7 movies, that means you still need to watch 12 more movies (19 - 7 = 12).
"Response:  If there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", then we can conclude that for every book in the series, there is one movie as well. Therefore, if there are x books in the series, there will be x/2 movies as well.  Since the question asks how many more books than movies there are in the series, we need to find out how much greater than x/2 is x.  Solving for x, we get:
x = 16 - (14/2) = 16 - 7 = 9
So, there are 9 more books than movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola""."
"Response:  If there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", then we can conclude that for every book, there are 2 films (since there are 10 films total). Therefore, if there are x books, there will be 2x films. So, if there are 19 books, there will be 38 films (2 x 19 = 38).  Hence, there are 38 more films than books in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola""."
"Response:  If you have read 13 books and watched 12 movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", then you have read more books than movies. To find out how many more books you have read, we can subtract the number of movies from the number of books: 13 - 12 = 1 So, you have read one more book than movie in this series."
Response:  We are given that there are 11 books in the series and we have read 7 of them. Therefore, the number of unread books is 4 (11 - 7).  Now, we are asked how many more films we have watched than books we have read. The information provided states that we have watched 21 films. So, to find out how many more films we have watched than books we have read, we need to subtract the number of films from the number of books: 21 - 4 = 17.  Therefore, we have watched 17 more films than books we have read.
Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have already read, and there are a total of 14 books in the series, then we can calculate how many more books you need to read as follows: Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Number of books read = 14 - 8 = 6 So, you still need to read 6 more books from the series.
Response:  We know that there are 19 different books in the series and you have already read 4 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books. Therefore, the number of books left to be read is:  Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books already read = 19 - 4 = 15.  So, you still need to read 15 more books from the series.
"Response:  If you have read 7 books and watched 4 movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", then you still need to watch 21 - 7 = 14 more movies. Therefore, you need to watch 14 more movies from the series."
"Response:  If there are 11 books in the series and we have read 11 of them, that means we still have 0 books left to read.  Similarly, if there are 40 movies in the series and we have watched 40 of them, that means we still have 0 movies left to watch. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 more books or movies to read/watch in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola""."
"Response:  If there are 17 different movies and 11 different books in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"", then we can conclude that there are:

Movies - Books = 17 - 11 = 6 more movies than books in the series.

So, there are 6 more movies than books in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola""."
"Response:  We are given that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"". If we have read 14 movies and watched 19 books, then we can calculate how many more books we have read than movies as follows:

Number of books read - Number of movies watched = 19 - 14 = 5

So, we have read 5 more books than movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series ""Ludak, glup, ≈°kola"". If you have read 19 films and watched 16 books, it means that you have watched more movies than you have read books. So, we can conclude that you have watched 3 more movies (5 - 1 = 3) than you have read books. Therefore, the number of movies you have watched is 5 + 3 = 8."
Response:  If Dave has $7 and he uses some of it to buy toys with entrance tickets, then he must have used at least $1 for each ticket (since there are 7 tickets). So, if he bought 3 toys with entrances tickets, he would have spent at least $3 ($1 x 3 = $3). Therefore, after buying those toys, he would have $4 left ($7 - $3 = $4). Now, let's assume that he also bought another toy without an entrance ticket. In this case, he would have spent nothing extra since all his money was already used up in buying the previous three toys. So, after buying the fourth toy, he would have $0 left ($4 - $0 = $4). Finally, we can conclude that Dave had $4 left after buying all four toys.
Response:  If Dave has won some cards and used 12 of them to buy some toys, then he must have had more than 12 cards left.  Therefore, if Dave has won x number of cards, then he will have (x - 12) cards left after using 12 of them to buy toys. So, the answer is (x - 12).
Response:  If Dave won $18 and spent $5 on toys and $11 on clothes, then he has $24 left ($18 - $5 - $11 = $24). So, there is $24 left for Dave after buying the toys and clothes.
Response:  If Dave won $19 in total and he spent $12 to buy some toys and $7 more to buy clothes, then we can say that the amount of money Dave spent on clothes is equal to the difference between the total amount of money he won and the amount he spent on toys. So, if we write this as an equation:  Money spent on clothes = Total amount of money won - Amount spent on toys  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Money spent on clothes = $19 - $12  = $7  Therefore, Dave spent $7 more on clothes than he did on toys.
Response:  If Dave used 8 carats to buy toys and 18 carats to buy clothes, then he spent more carats on clothes than on toys. So, the difference between the number of carats Dave spent on clothes and the number of carats he spent on toys is equal to the total amount of carats Dave spent on clothes minus the total amount of carats he spent on toys.  In other words, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of carats Dave spent on clothes - Number of carats Dave spent on toys = Total number of carats Dave spent on clothes + Total number of carats Dave spent on toys  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of carats Dave spent on clothes - Number of carats Dave spent on toys = 13 - 8 = 5 + 8 = 13  Therefore, Dave spent 13 more carats on clothes than on toys.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, then he currently has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left.  Since he used 10 tickets to buy some toys, he now has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Haley had planted 14 trees in her backyard and after Tornado 9 killed 5 of them, then we can say that 9 - 5 = 4 trees survived the tornado.
Response:  If Haley had planted 13 trees in her backyard and after Tornado 6 passed through, 5 of them were still standing, then we can conclude that 8 trees did not survive (13 - 5 = 8). Therefore, 8 trees died as a result of the tornado.
Response:  If Haley planted 20 trees in the courtyard and after the typhoon, 4 trees remained, then we can calculate how many trees were destroyed as follows: Number of trees destroyed = Total number of trees - Number of trees remaining After the typhoon, there were 16 fewer trees than the total number of trees planted (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, 16 trees were destroyed in the typhoon.
Response:  If Haley planted 10 trees in her backyard and after Tornado 5 passed through, only 7 trees remained standing, then how many trees did she grow?  Therefore, Haley grew 3 more trees (10 - 7 = 3).
"Response: 
Haley had planted 9 trees in her backyard before Tornado 4 killed them all. Then she planted another 5 trees. So, the total number of trees that Haley has is: 9 + 5 = 14 trees."
Response:  At first, there were 12 stumps in Haley's courtyard. After two stumps died, there were 10 stumps left (12 - 2 = 10). So, there are currently 10 stumps remaining in Haley's courtyard.
Response:  At first, there were 3 trees in Hayley's courtyard. After the typhoon, 13 trees were destroyed. So, if we subtract the number of surviving trees (3) from the total number of trees destroyed (13), we get: 10 - 3 = 7. Therefore, 7 more trees were destroyed than survived the typhoon.
Response:  At first, there were 11 trees in Haley's courtyard. After the typhoon, 2 trees were destroyed and 9 remained alive. So, the number of surviving trees is 9. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of trees (11) and the final number of surviving trees (9) is 2.
Response:  If they collect 66 baskets of mussels per day and each basket contains 28 mussels, then they collect 66 x 28 = 1804 mussels per day.
Response:  We know that 8 vreƒáa of wheat are harvested every day, so in one week we have:  8 vreƒáa/day x 7 dana = 56 vreƒáa/week. To find out how many days it will take to collect 24 vreƒáe of wheat, we need to divide the total number of vreƒáe by the daily amount:  56 vreƒáa/week / 24 vreƒáe/day = 2.33 days. So, it will take approximately 2 and a half days to collect 24 vreƒáe of wheat.
"Response:  If he went to see how the watermelons were growing and found out that they would take another 4 days to mature, then we can calculate how many baskets of watermelons they collect per day as follows:

Let X be the number of baskets of watermelons collected per day. Since there are 56 baskets in total, we know that X √ó 56 = 4d, where d is the number of days it takes for the watermelons to mature (in this case, 4 days).

Solving for X, we get:
X = 56 / 4 = 14
So they collect 14 baskets of watermelons per day."
"Response:  After 49 days of harvesting, if they collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges, then we can calculate how many baskets of oranges will be collected after 49 days as follows:

Number of baskets = Daily collection x Number of days
= 38 x 49
= 1762

Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1762 baskets of oranges."
Response:  After 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 66 x 87 = 5,490 vreƒáa of oranges. Since each vreƒáa contains 25 oranges, we get 5,490 x 25 = 137,250 oranges in total.
Response:  If they collect 8 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 35 oranges, then they collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day. So, they collect 280 oranges per day.
"Response:  If they collect 16 vreƒáa (baskets) of oranges per day and each basket contains 57 oranges, then in one day they will collect:

16 baskets x 57 oranges/basket = 901 oranges/day

Now we need to find out how many days it would take to collect 80 baskets of oranges. To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges needed (80 baskets x 57 oranges/basket) by the number of oranges collected per day:

80 baskets / 901 oranges/day = 87.4 days

So, it would take approximately 87.4 days to collect 80 baskets of oranges."
Response:  If they collect 67 vreƒáa of olives per day and each vreƒáa contains 12 olives, then they collect a total of 67 x 12 = 804 olives per day.  If they collect 35 vreƒáa of olives in total, then they collect a total of 35 x 12 = 420 olives altogether.
Response:  After 51 days of picking, they will have collected 51 x 74 = 3820 pomegranates and rejected 51 x 71 = 3619. So, there will be 3820 - 3619 = 101 more pomegranates left after 51 days of picking.
Response:  If they collect 76 baskets daily and reject 64 of them, then the number of baskets collected is equal to 76 - 64 = 12. Since each basket contains 50 mussels, the total number of mussels collected is 12 x 50 = 600. Therefore, they collect 600 mussels daily.
Response:  After 26 days of harvesting, if they are currently harvesting 28 vreƒáa mature and 52 vreƒáa immature oranges per day, then after 26 days we will have:  Vreƒáa mature oranges = (28 x 26) = 704 vreƒáa Vreƒáa immature oranges = (52 x 26) = 1328 vreƒáa So, after 26 days of harvesting, there will be in total: 704 + 1328 = 2032 vreƒáa oranges.
Response:  After 25 days of harvesting, we know that there are currently 82 vreƒáe zrele pomorand≈æa (mature mussels). To calculate how many vreƒáa zrele pomorand≈æa will be after 25 days, we need to use the formula: Number of vreƒáa = Initial number of vreƒáa x Growth rate per day / Total time for growth. The growth rate is given as 0.32 vreƒáe/dan (vreƒáe=vreƒáa), and the total time for growth is 25 dana (days). Plugging in these values, we get: Number of vreƒáa after 25 days = 82 vreƒái x 0.32 vreƒáe/dan / 25 dana = 49.6 vreƒáa. So, after 25 days, there will be approximately 49.6 vreƒáa zrele pomorand≈æe.
Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, if they collect 31 vreƒáa (baskets) of ripe mussels and 24 vreƒáe (baskets) of unripe mussels per day, we can calculate how many baskets of unripe mussels will be collected after 45 days as follows:  Number of unripe mussels = Total number of unripe mussels x Time in days = 24 vreƒáe/day x 45 days = 1080 unripe mussels After 45 days, therefore, there will be 1080 baskets of unripe mussels collected.
Response:  We know that there are 44 vreƒáa zrele pomorand≈æe and 25 vreƒáa nezrele pomorand≈æe collected daily. To find out how many more vreƒáa of zrele pomorand≈æe than nezrele pomorand≈æe are collected daily, we can subtract the number of vreƒáa of nezrele pomorand≈æe from the total number of vreƒáa of both types: 44 - 25 = 19. So, every day, 19 more vreƒáa of zrele pomorand≈æe are collected than nezrele pomorand≈æe.
"Response:  If he collects 5 vreƒáa zrele pomorand≈æe and 74 vreƒáe nezrele pomorand≈æe daily, then we can write it as:

Zrela pomoranda = 5 vreƒáa/day
Nez—Ä–µ–ª–∞ pomoranda = 74 vreƒáe/day

Now, let's find out how many more vreƒáa of unripe pomegranates are collected than ripe ones:

More unripe pomegranates = Nezrelne pomorande - Zrele pomorande
= 74 vreƒáe - 5 vreƒáa
= 69 vreƒáe/day

So, more than 69 vreƒáa of unripe pomegranates are collected than ripe ones per day."
"Response:  If they collected 54 baskets of oranges in total, and they collected 18 baskets per day, then we can calculate how many days it took them to collect all those oranges as follows:

Total number of baskets = 54
Number of baskets per day = 18
Days taken to collect all baskets = Total number of baskets / Number of baskets per day
= 54 / 18
= 3
Therefore, it took them 3 days to collect all 54 baskets of oranges."
"Response:  If they collected 56 baskets of oranges in total and they collected them for 14 days, then we can calculate how many baskets they collected per day as follows:

Total number of baskets = Number of days x Number of baskets per day
= 14 x?

So, if they collected 56 baskets in total and they collected them for 14 days, then they must have collected 4 (56 / 14) baskets per day on average."
Response:  We know that there are currently 5 vreƒáa zrelih pomorand≈æa being collected per day. After 73 days of collection, we can calculate how many vreƒáa zrelih pomorand≈æa will be collected in total using the formula: Number of vreƒáa = Daily collection x Number of days of collection. So, the number of vreƒáa zrelih pomorand≈æa after 73 days of collection is: Number of vreƒáa = 5 vreƒáa/day x 73 days = 365 vreƒáa. Therefore, after 73 days of collection, there will be 365 vreƒáa zrelih pomorand≈æa.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, we know that there are currently 65 vreƒáa unripe oranges and 46 vreƒáa ripe oranges per day. To find out how many vreƒáa of unripe oranges will be left after 6 days, we can multiply the current number of vreƒáa by half, since each orange takes 2 days to ripen: 65 x 0.5 = 32.5 vreƒáa. Similarly, for the ripe oranges, we have 46 x 0.5 = 23 vreƒáa. So, after 6 days of harvesting, there will be 32.5 vreƒáa of unripe oranges and 23 vreƒáa of ripe oranges left.
Response:  We know that he collected 41 vreƒáa unripe oranges and 86 vreƒáa ripe oranges per day. To find out how many more vreƒáa of ripe oranges are collected than unripe oranges, we can subtract the number of vreƒáa of unripe oranges from the total number of vreƒáa collected: 86 - 41 = 45. So, every day, he collects 45 more vreƒáa of ripe oranges than unripe oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 71 vreƒáa unripe crabs and 60 vreƒáa ripe crabs collected daily. To find out how many more unripe than ripe crabs are collected, we can divide the number of unripe crabs collected by the number of ripe crabs collected:  Number of unripe crabs collected / Number of ripe crabs collected = 71/60 = 1.18 or approximately 12 more unripe crabs are collected than ripe crabs. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  So, we know that the length of the room is 12 meters and its width is 11 meters. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we can use the following formula: Length = Width x 2 + Width. Substituting the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Length = (11) x 2 + (11) = 24 + 11 = 35 meters. Therefore, the room is 35 meters long compared to its width of 11 meters.
Response:  We know that the length of the room is 2 meters (m). To find out how wide the room is, we need to divide its length by the width. So, if the room is 2 m long and it needs to be divided into squares with sides equal to 14 square feet, then the width of each square foot would be half of the length of the room, or 2/14 = 0.143 meters per square foot. Therefore, the width of the room in meters is 0.143 x 2 = 0.286 meters.
Response:  We know that the length of the room is twice as wide, which means it is also twice as long. So if the width of the room is 2 meters (m), then its length must be 4m. Therefore, the area of the room can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 4m x 2m = 8 square meters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are already covered in the room. We know that the room is 3 + 4 = 7 meters long and 4 + 5 = 9 meters wide. Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = length x width = 7 x 9 = 63 square meters. Now, we have to calculate how much more carpet is needed to cover the entire floor. To do this, we divide the total area of the room by the area of each square meter of carpet: Total area / Area per sq m = 63 / 16 = 4 sq m. So, we need 4 additional square meters of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that the room is rectangular and has dimensions of 2 meters in length and 3 meters in width. To find out how many tiles are needed to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the room by the area of each tile. The area of each tile can be calculated as follows: Area of each tile = Length x Width = 4 square meters Since there are no units given for the length or width of the tiles, let's assume they are both measured in meters. Now, we can calculate the total area of the room using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Total area of the room = Length x Width = (2 meters) x (3 meters) = 6 square meters Therefore, if we want to cover the entire floor with tiles, we will need 6 / 4 = 1.5 tiles to cover the entire area. So, we will need 1.5 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We have 20 rooms in total and each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. To cover all the floors with carpeting, we will need  $\frac{Area of one room}{Area of one floor}$ = $\frac{19\times18}{Area of one floor}$ = $ \boxed{\frac{347}{ Area of one floor}}$  Therefore, if we want to know how many tiles are needed to cover all the floors, we can divide the number of rooms by the area of one tile: $\boxed{\frac{20rooms}{Area of one tile}} = \boxed{\frac{20}{Tile size}}$.
Response:  So, we know that the length of the room is 20 meters and its width is 19 meters. To find out how much longer the room is than its width, we can use the following formula: Length = Width x 2 + Width. Substituting the values given in the question into this formula, we get: Length = 19 x 2 + 19 = 38 meters. Therefore, the room is 38 meters long compared to its 19-meter width.
"Response:  We know that the area of the carpet is given as 10 square meters and we want to find out how wide it needs to be in order to cover the room. So let's call the width of the carpet ""x"" meters. Since the room is 5 feet long (which is equal to 60 inches), we can set up the following equation: Area of carpet = Length x Width = 60 x x meters^2 Now we are asked to find out how wide the carpet needs to be in order to cover the room. To do this, we need to solve for ""x"". Can you take it from here and find the value of ""x""?"
Response:  We know that the area of the carpet is 10 square meters and it needs to cover the room. The width of the room is twice the length, which means that if we divide the length of the room by 2, we will get the width. So, the length of the room is 2x = 4 meters. Now, we can find the area of the room by multiplying the length and width: Area = length x width = 4 x width = 8 square meters. Since the carpet has an area of 10 square meters, we need to use half of the area of the room for the carpet (since it covers only half of the room): Half of the area of the room = 10 / 2 = 5 square meters. Therefore, the length of the room is 4 meters and the width is 2 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and his room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To find out how much more carpet he needs to cover the entire floor, we can use the formula: Total area = Length x Width = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet So, Jesse needs an additional 80 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that each razorback t-shirt sells for $23 and during the game between Arkansas and Texas they sold 230 t-shirts. So we can calculate how many t-shirts were sold as follows:  T-shirts sold = Total amount earned / Price of one t-shirt  T-shirts sold = $230 / $23  T-shirts sold = 10  Therefore, the Razorbacks sold 10 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling three shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas is $51. So, we can assume that each shirt cost $17.
Response:  We know that in total they sold 95 shirts during both games. In Arkansas, they sold 47 shirts and in Texas they sold 48 shirts. So, we can calculate how much money they made from each game separately:  In Arkansas, they sold 47 shirts and earned $87 per shirt, so they made a total of $4011 ($87 x 47).  In Texas, they sold 48 shirts and earned $87 per shirt, so they made a total of $3964 ($87 x 48). Therefore, their total profit is $4011 + $3964 = $7975.
Response:  We know that during the game in Arkansas they sold $ 106 per shirt and overall they sold 242 shirts. So if they sold 115 shirts during the Texas game, then the price of each shirt was:  $ 106 / 242 = $ 0.437 per shirt.
Response:  We know that in total they sold 163 shirts during both games. In Arkansas, they sold 89 shirts. So, if we want to find out how much money they made from selling shirts during the Arkansas game, we can multiply the number of shirts sold during that game by the price of each shirt: $ 98 per shirt. Therefore, the amount of money earned from selling shirts during the Arkansas game is: $ 89 x $ 98 = $ 85.720.
Response:  We know that during the Arkansas game they sold $ 78 per shirt and they sold a total of 172 shirts. So, in total, they earned $ 13,040 ($ 78 x 172) during the Arkansas game. Now we are asked how much money they earned from selling shirts during the Texas game. Since they sold 186 shirts during this game, their earnings were $ 15,920 ($ 78 x 186). Therefore, the difference between the two amounts is $ 2,880.
Response:  We know that for each t-shirt sold, they make $99 and for each dress sold, they make $62. So if they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 dresses during the game, their total revenue from t-shirts would be:  Revenue from t-shirts = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 183 x $99 = $17,570 And their total revenue from dresses would be: Revenue from dresses = Number of dresses x Price per dress = 31 x $62 = $1,933 Therefore, their total revenue from both t-shirts and dresses is: Total revenue = Revenue from t-shirts + Revenue from dresses = $17,570 + $1,933 = $19,493
Response:  We know that they sold $74 in t-shirts and $156 in dresses during the game between Arkansas and Texas. So their total revenue from sales of clothing items was:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of dresses x Price per dress  Revenue = 74 x $20 + 156 x $30  Revenue = $1,480  Therefore, they earned $1,480 from selling clothing items during the game.
Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $192 from each t-shirt and $34 from each dress. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 dresses. To find out how much more money they made from selling shirts than dresses, we can subtract the amount of money they made from selling dresses from the total amount of money they made from selling both shirts and dresses. So, if they made $192 x 157 = $29,690 from selling t-shirts and $34 x 19 = $658 from selling dresses, then they made $29,690 - $658 = $28,032 more from selling t-shirts than dresses. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold is $28,032 / ($192 per t-shirt) = 145.
Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $86 per t-shirt and $232 per hoodie.  During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 hoodies. So, we can calculate how much more does a hoodie cost than a t-shirt as follows:  Hoodie price - T-shirt price = ($232 - $86) = $146  Therefore, a hoodie costs $146 more than a t-shirt.
Response:  The company sold each shirt for $51 during the game. If they offered a discount of $8 per shirt and sold 130 shirts, then their total revenue from shirt sales would be: Revenue = Number of shirts x Price per shirt - Discount amount Total revenue = 130 x $51 - ($8 x 130) Total revenue = $6,470 So, they earned $6,470 from selling shirts during the game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one razorback t-shirt costs $201. Then during the game between Arkansas and Texas, the price of each shirt increased by $217 to $428 per shirt. So if they sold 14 shirts, how much money did they make from selling those shirts? Therefore, their total revenue would be $428 x 14 = $5960.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $60 and each t-shirt sold for $10. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $60 = x \times $10 where x represents the number of t-shirts sold. To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we need to divide both sides of the equation by $10: $60 / $10 = x Now we have our final answer: x = 6. Therefore, they sold 6 t-shirts in total.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling shirts is $215 and they sold 5 shirts. So, we can calculate the price of each shirt as follows: Price = Total Amount / Number of Shirts = $215 / 5 = $43 per shirt.
Response:  We know that they sold $20 in t-shirts and $64 in hoodies during the game between Arkansas and Texas. So, their total revenue from these sales is:  Revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt + Number of hoodies x Price per hoodie  Revenue = 20 x $21 + 64 x $5  Revenue = $420 + $320  Revenue = $740  Therefore, they earned $740 from selling t-shirts and hoodies during the game.
Response:  We know that for each shirt sold, they make $204 and for each dress sold, they make $76. So if they sold 158 shirts during the game, their total revenue from shirts would be: 158 x $204 = $31,920 If they also sold 2 dresses during the game, their total revenue from dresses would be: 2 x $76 = $152 Total revenue from both shirts and dresses is therefore: $31,920 + $152 = $32,072 So, they made $32,072 in revenue from selling clothes during the game.
Response:  We know that razorback shop makes $210 for each shirt and $240 for each jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 177 dresses and 23 shirts. So we can calculate how much more money they made from selling shirts than dresses as follows:  Money made from shirts = Number of shirts x Price per shirt - Total amount of money made from both shirts and dresses = 177 x $210 - (177 + 23) x $240 = $36,830 - $5,940 = $30,890 Therefore, the Razorback Shop made $30,890 more from selling shirts than dresses during that particular game.
Response:  We know that the razorback shop makes $115 for each shirt and $25 for each jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas, they sold 113 dresses and 78 shirts. So, we can calculate how much more does a shirt cost than a dress as follows:  Number of shirts sold = 113  Price per shirt = $115  Total revenue from shirts = 113 x $115 = $13030  Number of dresses sold = 78  Price per dress = $115  Total revenue from dresses = 78 x $115 = $9060  Now, let's find out how much more does a dress cost than a shirt:  Difference in price = Total revenue from dresses - Total revenue from shirts  = $9060 - $13030  =-$4000  Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that a dress costs approximately $4000 more than a shirt at the Razorback Shop.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of chairs and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is: 5 x 10 = 50 chairs.
Response:  If they have two sets of chairs with the same number of chairs in each set, then we can say that there are twice as many chairs as there are people participating in the picnic. So, if there are 12 participants in total, then there will be 24 chairs (twice 12). Therefore, each person will have one chair.
Response:  If they have 9 chairs in their backyard and each table has 3 chairs, then we can conclude that there are 9 / 3 = 3 sets of tables with 3 chairs each. Therefore, they have 3 sets of stools.
Response:  If they have 11 sets of chairs and each set has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is: 11 x 13 = 133 chairs.
Response:  If they have 10 sets of chairs and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  Since there are 11 people sitting at the tables, we subtract that from the total number of chairs to find out how many chairs are left empty: 60 - 11 = 49. So, 49 chairs will be left empty.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. However, we also know that there are 6 more chairs than for guests. So, the total number of chairs for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and each set of stools has 3 stools, then we need to find out how many sets of stools will be needed in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of guests by the number of stools per set: Number of sets = Total number of guests x Number of stools per set  In this case, the total number of guests is 14, and the number of stools per set is 3, so we need: Number of sets = 14 x 3 = 42 sets of stools Therefore, 42 sets of stools will be needed for the party.
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for each of their 14 tables, then they will have in total 14 x 14 = 196 chairs. Since they only have 9 tables, that means they have more than 9 chairs. Therefore, the correct answer is 108 (9 - 9 = 0).
Response:  If Ako Lewis earns $460 in total during 5 weeks of harvesting, and he works for 7 days a week, then his daily income can be calculated as follows:  Daily income = Total amount earned / Number of working days  Daily income = $460 / 35 days (since there are 7 days in a week, and Ako works for 5 weeks)  So, Ako's daily income is $13.23 ($460 / 35 days).
Response:  If Lewis earns $16 per day during his harvest, and he earned a total of $1216 during the harvest, then we can calculate how many days he worked as follows: Total amount earned = Number of working days x Daily wage  So, in this case, the number of working days is equal to the total amount earned divided by the daily wage: Number of working days = $1216 / $16  Number of working days = 78 days Therefore, Lewis worked for 78 days during his harvest.
Response:  If Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks (a season), he will have earned $4,596 ($21 x 216). Now, if he has to pay $702 in taxes, his remaining amount after taxes would be: $4,596 - $702 = $3,894. So, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $3,894.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week during 223 weeks of harvest season, then he earns:

$1357 x 223 = $294,011

If he works for 73 seasons, his total earnings will be:

$294,011 x 73 = $6,087,333

Therefore, if Lewis works for 73 seasons, he will earn approximately $6,087,333."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $28 per week during 109 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total earnings from harvesting are: $$ = 28 \times 109 = 2960$$ dollars. Secondly, we know that Lewis also works overtime and earns $939 per week for that work. So, his total earnings from working overtime are: $$ = 939 \times 52 = 47580$$ dollars. Finally, we want to find out how much money Lewis earns during the season of harvesting only. To do this, we subtract the amount he earned from working overtime ($47580) from the total amount he earned ($2960 + $47580): $$ = 2960 + 47580 - 47580 = 2960 $$ dollars. Therefore, Lewis earns $2960 during the season of harvesting.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income from farming is:  $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings = 233 \times 403 = 93,190$$ Now, we are asked how much he has to pay in rent each week. The question states that he pays $49 per week in rent. So, we can calculate the number of weeks he has to pay this amount as follows:  $$ Number of Weeks to Pay Rent = Total Income / Rent Per Week = 93,190 / 49 = 1,900 weeks$$ Therefo
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $368 per week for 1359 weeks of harvesting. Therefore, his total income from farming is:

$368/week x 1359 weeks = $472,072

Now, we are asked how much he pays in rent each week during the harvest season. We can assume that this amount is fixed and does not change throughout the season. So, if he pays $388 per week in rent, then his total rent payment for the entire harvest season would be:

$388/week x 1359 weeks = $517,610

Therefore, Lewis pays a total of $472,072 - $517,610 = $-45,538 in rent during the harvest season."
Response:  If Lewis earns $491 per week for 118 weeks of harvesting and has to pay $216 rent each week, his total income for the season would be: Income = Total number of weeks x Weekly income = 118 x $491 = $57,388 Now, let's calculate how much he will have at the end of the season after paying the rent: Ending balance = Total income - Rent paid = $57,388 - $216 x Number of weeks = $57,388 - $2,400 = $54,988 So, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $54,988 in cash.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $133 per month and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he earns:
$133/month x 4 weeks/month = $528 per week
So, Lewis earns $528 per week."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per day during harvest and he earned a total of $178, then we can calculate how many days he worked as follows:

$178 = $2 x Number of days worked
Number of days worked = $178 / $2
Number of days worked = 89 days (round up)
Therefore, if Lewis works for 89 days during the harvest season, he earned a total of $2 x 89 = $178."
Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet tall and the water is 10 times deeper than he is. So if Dean is 9 feet tall, then the water is 90 feet deep (since it is 10 times deeper).
Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron, so Dean is at a depth of 2 meters less than Ron. Therefore, if Ron is at a depth of 4 meters, then Dean is at a depth of 4 - 2 = 2 meters. So, the water was 2 meters deep.
"Response:  We know that:
Ron is 3 meters (9 feet) shorter than Dean.
Dean is at a depth of 5 times his height.
The water is 12 times deeper than Ron's height.
From this information we can calculate:
Ron's height = x meters (since he is 3 meters shorter than Dean).
Water depth = 5x + 12 (since it is 5 times Deans height plus 12 times Ron's height).
Now we have two equations and two unknowns:
x =? (Ron's height)
5x + 12 =? (water depth)
We solve for x first:
x = 4 meters ( since Dean is 7 feet tall, so Ron is 7 - 3 = 4 meters taller than Dean).
Now we substitute this value into the second equation to find the water depth:
5(4) + 12 = 60 meters (the correct answer)."
Response:  We know that Dean is 1.80 meters (or 6 feet) taller than Ron. So if Ron was standing at 4 meters above sea level, then Dean would be standing at 4 + 1.8 = 5.8 meters above sea level. Now we can use the given information about the depth of the water to find out how deep it was relative to where Dean and Ron were standing. The depth of the water is given as 15 times greater than Dean's height. So if Dean is 1.80 meters tall, then the depth of the water is 15 x 1.8 = 27 meters. Therefore, the water was 27 meters deep relative to where Dean and Ron were standing.
"Response:  We know that:

* The depth of water is 16 times greater than Ron's height.
* Dean is 2 meters taller than Ron.

So we can write an equation based on these two pieces of information:

Depth = (Ron's height) x 16
= (2 + Ron's height) x 16

Now we need to solve for ""Deep"". Can you do it?"
Response:  We know that Dean is 6 feet tall and Ron is 15 feet tall. So, if they are both in the water at the same depth of 9 times Dean's height, then we can say that Dean is underwater to a depth of 9 x 6 = 54 feet.
Response:  If Brajan has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among 2 shelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.
"Response:  If Brajan has 42 books in total and each book is divided into two volumes (policies), then we have:

Number of policies = Total number of books / Number of volumes per book
= 42 / 2
= 21

So, Brajan has 21 policies."
Response:  If he has 27 books and each book is divided into 23 parts (police), then he has 27 x 23 = 611 parts for his books. Similarly, if he has 80 magazines and each magazine is also divided into 23 parts, then he has 80 x 23 = 1940 parts for his magazines. So, in total, he has 611 + 1940 = 2551 parts for all of his publications. Therefore, he has 27 x 23 = 611 books and 80 x 23 = 1940 magazines in total.
Response:  If he has 9 books and each book is in 10 shelves, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 shelves for his books. Similarly, if he has 46 magazines and each magazine is in 10 shelves, then he has 46 x 10 = 460 shelves for his magazines. So, the total number of shelves he has is 90 + 460 = 550 shelves.
"Response:  If Brajan has 23 books and each of his 29 policemen has 61 magazines, then the total number of books and magazines that Brajan has is:

Books = 23 x 29 = 674
Magazines = 61 x 29 = 1759
Therefore, Brajan has a total of 674 books and 1759 magazines."
"Response:  If Brajan has 7 police with the same number of books, then he must have x books in total. Since each police has y books, we can write an equation:
x = 7y
Now, we know that the total number of books Brajan has is 28, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
x = 7y = 28
Solving for y, we get:
y = 28/7 = 4
So, Brajan has 4 books in each police."
"Response:  If Brajan has 38 books and each book is contained in two volumes (polica), then we can calculate the number of polica as follows:

38 books / 2 volumes per book = 19 polica
Therefore, Brajan has 19 polica."
"Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 10 friends and each invitation has 2 invitees (i.e., guests), then the total number of guests invited is:

10 x 2 = 20 guests
Therefore, if Carol bought packages with 5 invitations in each package, she would need at least 4 packages (20 / 5 = 4)."
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to 12 friends and bought 3 packages of invitations with the same number of invitations in each package, then we can say that there are 12 / 3 = 4 invitations per package. So, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends and each package of invitations she bought contained 10 invitations, then the total number of invitations she had was 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she only sent out 2 invitations, there will be 70 - 2 = 68 unused invitations left over. Therefore, the correct answer is 68.
Response:  If each package of invitations contains 14 invitations and she bought 6 packages, then she has in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Additionally, she also bought 11 more invitations, so the final number of invitations is 84 + 11 = 95. Therefore, her friends can be invited to call 95 times.
Response:  If Carol sent invitations to her friends for her birthday and each package of invitations she bought had 3 invitations inside, then she must have bought $2 \times 3 = 6$ packages of invitations in total.  Since she wants to invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional $\require{cancel} 9 - 6 = 3$ packages of invitations. Therefore, Carol needs to buy $3 \times 3 = 9$ extra invitations to invite all $9$ friends.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game, then she scored a total of 12 x 3 = 36 points in all three games combined. Therefore, the number of games played is 36 / 12 = 3.
Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points per game, then she totalled 191 points (109 + 82) for every match. So, if she played 79 games, her overall score would be 14,539 points (191 x 79).
Response:  If Melissa has scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points in each game, then we can write an equation as follows:  Points = Number of games x Points per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get:  Points = 5 x 7 = 35 Therefore, Melissa played 5 games.
Response:  If Melissa has scored 91 points in 13 games and she scores the same number of points in each game, then we can write an equation based on this information: Points = x Where 'x' represents the number of games played. Now, if we substitute the value of 'x' from the problem (i.e., 13), we get: Points = 91 Substituting the values, we get: 91 = x Solving for 'x', we get: x = 7 So, Melissa scored 7 points per game.
Response:  If there are 4 seats in each gondola of the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride at the same time, then we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many gondolas can fit in one rotation. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that there are several seats in each gondola of the Ferris wheel and that each seat can accommodate 9 people. So, if we have X number of gondolas, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel would be X x 9 =?. Now, let's assume that 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time as the number of seats. Therefore, we need to find out how many times 18 goes into X. Can you solve for X?
Response:  We know that each gondola in the park can hold 15 people. If we have 20 gondolas, then the total number of people they can carry is: 20 x 15 = 300 people. So, the answer is 300.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 gondolas in total and each can accommodate 15 people. So, we have:

Number of gondolas = 18
Capacity per gondola = 15
Total capacity = Number of gondolas x Capacity per gondola
= 18 x 15
= 270 people

Therefore, the Ferris wheel can accommodate 270 people at a time."
Response:  We know that there are 6 seats in each gondola of the ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, if there are already 16 people at one point, we need to find out how many more people can join that point. To do this, we will divide the total number of people (16) by the capacity of each gondola (14): Number of gondolas = Total people / Capacity per gondola = 16 / 14 = 2 Therefore, two additional gondolas can join the point where 16 people are already present.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 14 people, so we have:
Small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 people who can ride at once. Now, let's calculate how many people can ride on the large seats: Large seats = 23 x 54 = 1208 people who can ride at once. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on the Ferris wheel is: Total riders = Small seats + Large seats = 28 + 1208 = 1236 people."
Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, while each large seat can accommodate 12 people. So, we need to find out how many people can be taken on the ferris wheel at once. The total number of people who can be taken on the ferris wheel = Number of small seats x Capacity per small seat + Number of large seats x Capacity per large seat  = 3 x 16 + 7 x 12  = 54 + 84  = 138 people Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride on the ferris wheel at one time is 138 people.
Response:  If there are 16 people who can ride in a helicopter at the same time and each seat has 4 people, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many seats there are. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  If 4 people can fit in a helicopter in heaven at the same time, and there are x seats in the helicopter, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of people = Seats in the helicopter.  Therefore, if there are x seats in the helicopter, then the number of people who can fit in it at once is equal to x.
Response:  If we have 7 pictures and each picture has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x Number of slices = Total number of slices. Since there are 14 total slices, if each slice is in one picture, then there are 14 / 7 = Number of slices per picture. Therefore, there are 7 pictures with Number of slices per picture = Number of slices per picture.
Response:  If each pizza has 2 pieces and we ordered a total of 28 pieces of pizza, then...
Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, in total we need to calculate how many pieces of pizza there are.  Therefore, the number of pieces of pizza is: 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of pizza.
Response:  If there are two of us and each pizza has 10 slices, then we will have to divide the total number of slices equally between the two of us. So, if we divide 100 slices (the total number of slices in one pizza) equally between two people, each person will get 50 slices.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers and together they sowed some seeds in each flowerbed. They put 10 seeds in every flower bed. How many seeds did they sow altogether if there are 45 flower beds? So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of seeds = Total number of flower beds x Number of seeds per flower bed Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of seeds = 45 x 10 = 450 seeds Therefore, Paige and her mother sowed 450 seeds altogether.
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and there are 9 flower beds, then each flower bed contains how many seeds?  We can divide the total number of seeds by the number of flower beds to find out:  Number of seeds per flower bed = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds = 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per flower bed. So, if they put the same number of seeds in each flower bed, they would have put 5 seeds in each of the 9 flower beds.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 36 seeds and together they planted all of them successfully. Since only 58 seedlings grew in each flower bed, we can conclude that there were 58/12 = 4.83 flower beds (or compartments). So, the number of flower beds is 4.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds and they together sowed those seeds in 3 flower beds with 15 seeds each. So, the total number of seeds sown is: 55 + 55 + 55 = 165 seeds. Now, we are told that only 60 seeds germinated into flowers in all three flower beds. Therefore, the number of flowers grown is: 60 / 165 x 100% = 37%. So, Paige and her mother grew 37% of the total number of seeds sown, which means they grew 37/100 x 165 = 59 flowers.
Response:  If they planted 10 seeds in each of 6 flower beds, then they have planted a total of 6 x 10 = 60 seeds. So, there are 60 flower beds.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother to plant flowers in 8 flower beds and they planted a total of 32 seeds, then we can assume that each flower bed received an equal number of seeds. So, if they planted 32 seeds in total, then each flower bed received 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4). Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If Matthew had 2 creepers for each of his 11 friends, then he would have given away a total of 2 x 11 = 22 creepers. Therefore, Matthew had 22 creepers in total.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 creepers and gave 2 to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 2 x 8 = 16 creepers away. So, Matthew has 8 - 16 = -8 creepers left.
"Response:  If Matthew had 15 creamers and gave them to his five friends, then he would have given each friend:

Matthew gave out 15 creamers / 5 friends = 3 creamers per friend
So now there are 3 creamers left over from what Matthew originally had (15 - 3 = 12)."
Response:  If Matthew had 24 creepers and gave some to his friends, then he has fewer creepers left. Let's say he gave 6 creepers to each of his 3 friends, so he has 24 - (6 x 3) = 24 - 18 = 6 creepers left. Therefore, Matthew has 6 creepers left.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 creepers and gave equal numbers of them to his 11 friends, then each friend would have received 2 creepers (since 22 / 11 = 2). Similarly, if he had 34 cookies and gave equal numbers of them to his 11 friends, then each friend would have received 3 cookies (since 34 / 11 = 3). Therefore, each friend ate 2 creepers and 3 cookies.
Response:  If Matthew had 30 cookies and gave an equal number to his friends, then he must have given 30/x cookies to each of them, where x is the number of his friends. Since he had 29 creamers, that means he had 29 + 30 = 59 total treats to give away. So, if he gave an equal number to his friends, then he gave 59/x cookies to each of them.
"Response:  If Matthew had 14 creepers and 21 cookies to share equally among his seven friends, each friend would get:

Crepeers: 14/7 = 2 per person
Cookies: 21/7 = 3 per person
Therefore, each of Matthew's friends got 2 creepers and 3 cookies."
"Response:  If Matthew has 36 creamers and he wants to share them equally among his 18 friends, each friend will get:

$$ \text{Number of creamers per friend} = \frac{\text{Total number of creamers}}{ \text{Number of friends}} $$

So, the number of creamers per friend is:

$$ \boxed{36 / 18 = 2} $$

Therefore, each friend will get 2 creamers."
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 6 creepers, and he had 36 creepers in total, then he must have received 36/6 = 6 friends. Therefore, Matthew got 6 friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 23 creepers and gave 11 of them to his friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of creepers (since he didn't give any more than that). So, if Matthew gave X creepers to each of his friends, then after giving some away, he would have X - 11 = 12 creepers left for himself. Therefore, each friend got X/11 = 1 creeper from Matthew.
"Response:  If Matthew had 31 creepers and gave 23 to his five friends, then he must have given each friend an equal number of creepers (since they are all friends). So, if x is the number of creepers that Matthew gave to each of his five friends, we can write the equation:

Matthew = 31 - 5x

Now, we know that the total number of creepers that Matthew gave away is 23, so we can set up another equation based on this information:

31 - 5x = 23

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

So, Matthew gave each of his five friends 7 creepers."
"Response:  If Matthew had 32 creamers and 98 cookies to share among his 4 friends, he would have given each friend an equal number of creamers and cookies. So, if each friend got x creamers and y cookies, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 32 (number of creamers)
x + 9y = 98 (number of cookies)

Now, we need to solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 32, so we can subtract y from both sides:

x = 32 - y

Now, we substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

(32 - y) + 9y = 98

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

10y = 66

Dividing both sides by 10, we find that y = 6.6.

So, Matthew gave each friend 6 creamers and 7 cookies.

Therefore, the answer is:

x = 32 - y = 32 - 6 = 26
y = 6"
Response:  If Matthew had 10 creepers and gave 4 of them to each of his 4 friends, then he would have given away 4 x 4 = 16 creepers in total. Similarly, if he had 8 cookies and gave 2 of them to each of his 4 friends, then he would have given away 2 x 4 = 8 cookies in total. So, there are 16 - 8 = 8 cookies left with Matthew after giving them away. Therefore, each friend got 8 / 4 = 2 cookies.
"Response:  If Matthew had 13 creamers and 15 cookies to share among his 28 friends, each friend would get:

Creemers: 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 4-5 creamers per person)
Cookies: 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 5-6 cookies per person)
So, approximately 4-5 creamers and 5-6 cookies were consumed by each of Matthew's 28 friends."
Response:  If she bought several bottles of water when they were on sale and consumed 109 bottles per day, then we can calculate how many days it took her to drink all those bottles using the information that each bottle lasted for 74 days. So, if she consumed 109 bottles per day, then in total, she would have drunk 109 x 365 = 3872 bottles over one year. Since each bottle lasted for 74 days, it means that she had enough time to drink 3872 / 74 = 52 bottles per day. Therefore, if she bought several bottles of water when they were on sale, then she must have finished them within 52 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 153 liters of water when it was on sale and she drank the same number of liters each day, then we can find out how many days it took her to drink all those liters. So, let x be the number of days Debbie drank water. We know that every day she drank the same amount (in liters), so if she drank x liters per day, she drank in total 153x liters. Now, we need to find out what is the value of x. Since Debbie drank water for 17 days, we have: 153x = 153(17) = 2491 liters. Solving for x, we get: x = 2491 / 153 = 16.5 days. Therefore, Debbie drank all 153 liters of water within 16.5 days.
"Response:  If she bought 264 liters of water when it was on sale and consumed 15 liters per day for 11 days, we can calculate how much water is left as follows:

Total amount of water purchased = 264 liters
Number of days she consumed water = 11 days
Amount of water consumed each day = 15 liters

Now let's find out how much water is left:

Water left = Total amount of water purchased - (Number of days x Amount of water consumed each day)
= 264 liters - (11 x 15 liters)
= 264 liters - 165 liters
= 99 liters

So, there are 99 liters of water left."
"Response:  If she bought 301 bottles of water at a discount and consumed 144 bottles per day for several days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Day 1: She consumes 144 bottles, so she has 301 - 144 = 157 bottles left.

Day 2: She consumes another 144 bottles, so she has 157 - 144 = 13 bottles left.

And so on...

Therefore, if she consumed 144 bottles per day for several days, she would have 13 bottles left."
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of sparkling water when they were on sale, that means she has a total of 101 bottles of drinking water (88 + 13 = 101).  If she consumes 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of sparkling water per day, it will take her approximately days to finish all the bottles. So, the answer is days.
"Response:  If Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of sparkling water when they were on sale, that means she paid $X for them.  Now, if she drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 cans of sparkling water per day, it will take her Y days to finish both types of water. Since she already has 200 bottles of water and 256 cans of sparkling water left, after Y days she will have Z bottles and cans remaining, where:

Z = X - (312 \* B) + (256 \* C)

where B is the number of bottles of water drunk per day, and C is the number of cans of sparkling water drunk per day. In this case, B = 312 and C = 4. Plugging in these values, we get:

Z = X - (312 \* 312) + (256 \* 4)
= X - 97,840 + 1000
= X - 96,840

So, after Y days, Debbie will have Z bottles and cans of water remaining, which is equal to $X - 96,840."
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she wants to buy 12 bottles of water, we can calculate how much it will cost her in one day as follows:

Cost = Number of bottles x Price per bottle
= 6 x $X
= $60 (where X is the price of one bottle)
So, if Debbie buys 12 bottles of water, it will cost her $60 per day."
Response:  If Debbie bought 95 bottles of carbonated drinks and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale, then she paid $ for those drinks.  Now, if she consumes 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of carbonated drinks per day, how many days will it last her?  To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles she has with the number of bottles she consumes per day:  Total number of bottles = Number of bottles consumed per day x Number of days  So, in this case, the total number of bottles is:  Total number of bottles = 95 + 180 = 275  Divide that by the number of bottles she consumes per day:  Total number of days = 275 / 69 (number of days)  Therefore, Debbie's supply of water will last her approximately days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of carbonated water and 162 bottles of regular water when they were on sale, then she paid $X for those bottles.  If she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of carbonated water per day, then she will finish all her drinks in Y days. Since she finished all her drinks, there are no remaining bottles of carbonated water left after that period. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: X + Y = 360 + 162 ( since she already consumed these many bottles) Now let's solve for Y: Y = X / (360 + 162) Substituting the value of X from the problem statement: Y = $157 / (360 + 162) = 48 days So, the carbonated water will last Debbie for 48 days.
"Response:  If Faye has placed 11 olive branches in each of the 14 rows she has created, then the total number of olive branches Faye has is:

11 x 14 = 154

Therefore, Faye has 154 olive branches in total."
Response:  If Faye has placed 12 oak leaves in total and she has divided them into 3 rows, then each row must contain an equal number of oak leaves. Therefore, we can conclude that: Row 1 contains 4 oak leaves (since 12 / 3 = 4). Row 2 contains 4 oak leaves as well (again, 12 / 3 = 4). And Row 3 also contains 4 oak leaves (yet again, 12 / 3 = 4). So, to summarize: Row 1 has 4 oak leaves, Row 2 has 4 oak leaves, and Row 3 has 4 oak leaves as well.
Response:  If Faye has 28 packets of pencils and each packet contains 24 pencils, then she has in total 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since she can make 16 rows with 16 pencils in each row, she can make 16 x 16 = 256 rows of pencils. Therefore, Faye can make 256 rows of pencils.
Response:  We know that Faye has 22 olovke in each row and she has 6 rows of olovke. Therefore, the total number of olovke Faye has is:  Number of olovke per row x Number of rows = 22 x 6 = 132 olovka. So, Faye has 132 olovka in total.
Response:  If Faye has 35 olovka and 7 colors, she can make at most 35 / 7 = 5 complete rows of olive stacks with one color each. So there will be 5 rows in total.
Response:  If she has 19 rows and each row contains 4 olive branches, then the total number of olive branches is 19 x 4 = 76.  And if each row also contains 27 colors, then the total number of colors used is 76 x 27 = 2015. Therefore, Faye has 76 olive branches and 2015 colors in her artwork.
"Response:  If she had 7 rows with 36 olive branches in each row and 30 colors in each row, then the total number of olive branches would be:

7 rows x 36 olive branches per row = 252 olive branches
And if there were 30 colors in each row, then the total number of colors would be:

7 rows x 30 colors per row = 210 colors
So, Faye had a total of 252 olive branches and 210 colors."
Response:  We know that Faye has 11 rows of olive and 31 olives in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of olives as follows: Total number of olives = Number of rows x Number of olives per row = 11 x 31 = 341 olives. Similarly, we know that Faye has 27 colors in each row, so the total number of colors is: Total number of colors = Number of rows x Number of colors per row = 11 x 27 = 297 colors. So, to summarize, there are 341 olives and 297 colors in Faye's artwork.
Response:  If Faye has built 30 ovens and each oven contains 5 eggs, then she has a total of 30 x 5 = 150 eggs. Therefore, Faye can build 150 / 5 = 30 rows of ovens.
Response:  If Faye has 6 olovaka in total and she wants to divide them into two equal parts, then each part will have 3 olovaka (since 2 x 3 = 6). So, Faye has put 3 olovaka in each of the two rows.
Response:  If Faye had 35 packages of nails and each package contained 4 nails, then she would have total number of nails = 35 x 4 = 140 nails. Now, if we assume that she placed these nails in rows with two nails in each row, then the number of rows she could make is equal to the total number of nails divided by 2 (since there are two nails in each row). So, the number of rows she could make = 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, Faye could make 70 rows of nails.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packages of nails and each package contained 6 nails. So, in total, she had 31 x 6 = 186 nails. Now, we are asked how many rows she has. Since there were 19 nails in each row, if she has m rows, then the number of nails in one row is 19. Therefore, the total number of nails in all the rows is m x 19 = 19m. Finally, since Faye placed her nails in rows, we can say that the total number of nails she has is equal to the number of rows she made plus the number of nails in each row. So, the final answer is 186 + 19m = 186 + 19(5) = 186 + 95 = 281.
Response:  If she has 30 rows with 71 beads and 24 beads in each row, then...
Response:  If she has 6 credes and 21 olovka in each row, then she has 6 x 21 = 126 olovaka in total.
Response:  We know that there are 7 school buses and 98 students in total. If all of them go on an outing together, each bus will have to carry some number of students. So, we need to find out how many students can fit in one bus. Since there are 21 classrooms in the school, each bus has to carry at least 21/7 = 3 students per bus. Therefore, if all 7 buses are full, they can carry a total of 7 x 3 = 21 students.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each classroom can accommodate 30 students (as assumed). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:

Number of classrooms = 84
Capacity of each classroom = 30 students
Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity of each classroom
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
So, there are approximately 2520 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in total and each classroom has 66 students. Therefore, we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4232 students. Since each student needs to be transported in a school bus, we need at least one school bus for every 4232/6 = 705 students. So, we need 7 school buses to transport all the students on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and 58 students in each grade level, so we have 58 x 4 = 232 students in total. Since there are only two seats per bus, we need at least 232 / 2 = 116 buses to transport all the students on the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 116.
Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. So, we can assume that there are 120/number of classes = x students in each class. Since there are 24 classes, then x = 24 \* 120 = 2880 students. Therefore, there are 2880 students in each grade level or classroom.
"Response:  If there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus, then we need to divide the number of students by the number of seats per bus to find out how many buses are needed:

Number of students = 102
Number of seats per bus = 8

So, we need:

102 / 8 = 13 buses
Therefore, 3 buses will be required for the trip."
"Response:  If there are 102 classrooms and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip, then the number of students going on the trip is:

$$ \text {Number of students going on the trip} = 102 - 11 = 91 $$

So, 91 students will be going on the trip."
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 3 places in the bus. So, we have to divide 72 by 3 to get the number of buses needed for the trip: 72 / 3 = 24. Therefore, 24 buses will be needed for the trip.
Response:  If there are 46 school buses and 92 students in total, then each bus can carry an average of 2 students (since there are 92 students divided by 46 buses). So, if all the buses are full, then each bus has 2 students on it.
Response:  If there are 11 boys and each boy has as many marbles as Haley had (which is 9), then we can write an equation:  Number of marbles = Total number of boys x Number of marbles per boy  Number of marbles = 11 x 9  Number of marbles = 99  Therefore, if Haley gave 9 marbles to each of the 11 boys, she gave in total 99 marbles.
Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and gives 5 to each of the boys, then she gave a total of 5 x 5 = 25 balls to all the boys together. So, there are still 10 - 25 = 5 balls left with Haley.
Response:  If there are 4 students in total and they want to divide equally among them, each student will get 6 kuglices (4/4=6). So, if Haley has 23 kuglies and wants to keep 15 for himself, then he will give away 8 kuglies to the other three students (23-15=8). Therefore, the four students will receive 8 kuglies each (8 x 4 = 32).
Response:  If Haley has 26 kuglica and there are 13 boys who want to play with kuglice, each of them will get 26/13 = 2 kuglica.  And if there are 50 boys who want to play with cards, each of them will get 26 - (2 x 13) = 7 kuglica.
Response:  If there are 20 marbles and there are 5 children in the class, each child will get 4 marbles (20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  If there are 28 children and each child gets 2 balls from Haley, then the total number of balls given out is:  Number of children x Number of balls received per child = 28 x 2 = 56 balls. Therefore, there were 56 balls in total.
"Response:  If Frank reads 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank will need 27 days to finish reading his favorite book if he continues to read at a rate of 14 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank reads 22 pages per day and it takes him 569 days to finish the book, then we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows:

Number of pages = Total pages in the book / Number of days taken to read the book
= 300 pages (assuming the book has 300 pages) / 569 days
= 1.87 pages per day
Therefore, there are approximately 300 pages in the book."
Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish his book with 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. So, he read at most $ \frac{612}{6} = 102$ pages per day.
Response:  If Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book and the book had 555 pages divided into 5 chapters, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if there are 5 chapters in total, and Frank took 220 days to read the entire book, then the number of pages he read per day is: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book Now, let's assume that each chapter has an equal number of pages. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if the book has 555 pages in total, and there are 5 chapters, then the number of pages in each chapter is: Number of pages in each chapter = 555 pages / 5 chapters = 111 pages per chapter Based on this calculation, each chapter in the book contains approximately 111 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 660 days and it had 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can use the following formula: Number of chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Time taken to finish the book In this case, the total number of chapters is 15, and the time taken to finish the book is 660 days. So, we can plug in these values and solve for x: Number of chapters read per day = 15 / 660 = 0.0247 or approximately 1 chapter per day Now, let's convert this value from decimal format to fractional format: Number of chapters read per day as a fraction = 0.0247 = 1/41 Therefore, Frank read one chapter per day.
Response:  If Frank read each book in 3 days and each book has 249 pages, then he reads at a rate of pages per day. So, if he reads one book in 3 days, he reads pages per day. Therefore, Frank read pages daily.
"Response:  If Frank read x books and each book has y pages, then he spent z days reading, where:
x = number of books read
y = number of pages in each book
z = total number of days spent reading
We are given that Frank read 66 pages per day, so we can write:
x = 66 (books)
y = 66 (pages/book)
z = 12 (days/book)
Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Frank to read all the books he wants to read. We know that Frank needs 492 days to read all the books he wants to read, so we can write:
z = 492 (total number of days needed to read all books)
Substituting the values we have found, we get:
x = 66
y = 66
z = 492
Solving for x, we get:
x = 30
So, Frank read 30 books in 12 days each."
"Response:  If it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book and the book had 112 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank will need 72 days to finish reading his favorite book if he reads 8 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank took 30 days to finish his favorite book and each chapter has 450 pages, then he read:

Number of chapters = Number of days x Number of pages per chapter
= 30 x 450
= 13,500 pages

So, Frank read 13,500 pages in 30 days, which means he read approximately 450 pages per day."
"Response:  If Frank took 607 days to finish his favorite book and each chapter has 594 pages, then we can calculate how many chapters he read per day as follows:

Chapters/Day = Total Chapters / Time Taken
= 3 Chapters / 607 Days
= 1 Chapter/82 Days

So, Frank read one chapter every 82 days. Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter:

Pages/Chapter = Total Pages / Number of Chapters
= 594 Pages / 3 Chapters
= 198 Pages/Chapter

Therefore, there are 198 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and each chapter had 2 sections with 405 pages each. So, he read 810 pages per day (2 x 405).
Response:  If we divide $120 by 6, we get $20 per package. So, each pack of 6 DVD-As costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then the cost of 33 packages would be:
$81 x 33 = $2690."
"Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $107, then we can find out how many packages we can buy with a discount of $93 as follows:

$107 x = $93

Solving for x, we get:

x = 107 / 93 = 1.14 (or approximately 107/93 = 1.14)

So, if you have $93 to spend on DVDs, you can buy approximately 107/93 = 107/1.14 = 92 packages of DVDs."
"Response:  If each package of DVDs costs $76, and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then we need to calculate how much one package would cost without the discount and how much it would cost with the discount. So, let's do that:

Cost of one package without discount = $76
Discount amount = $25
Total cost of one package after applying the discount = Cost of one package without discount - Discount amount
= $76 - $25
= $51

So, if you want to buy each package of DVDs, you will have to pay $51 for each one."
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend, and each package costs $26, then you can buy:
$104 / $26 = 4 packages
So, you can buy 4 packages of DVDs."
Response:  If we have 28 dollars and we want to buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package must cost less than $14. So, the price of each package is $14/2 = $7.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in Filipova collection and we want to group them into groups of size 2. So, we will divide them equally among 9 groups (since 18 / 2 = 9). Therefore, there are 9 groups of 2 bananas each.
"Response:  We know that there are 140 groups of bananas in Filip's collection and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas in Filip's collection is:

140 x 187 = 23,600

So, there are 23,600 bananas in Filip's collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and they are organized into 7 groups. Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is:

Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 203 / 7 = 28

So, each group contains 28 bananas."
"Response:  We know that there are 356 naranƒça in total. If they are organized into groups of 178, then each group must contain an integer number of naranƒça between 0 and 356, inclusive.  Therefore, we can write:

Number of naranƒça in each group = (Total number of naranƒça) / (Number of groups) = 356 / 178 = 2
So, each group contains exactly 2 naranƒça."
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups in Filip's collection and each group contains an unknown number of bananas. Therefore, we can write the equation: Number of bananas = Total number of bananes / Number of groups. In this case, the total number of bananas is given as 392, so we can plug it into the equation to get: Number of bananas = 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains 2 bananas.
"Response:  If there are 180 bananas in Filipova collection and they are organized into groups of size 18, then we can find out how many groups there are as follows:

Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group
= 180 / 18
= 10

So, there are 10 groups of bananas in Filipova collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are organized into two groups. So, we can say that the number of bananas in each group is equal to 290 / 2 = 145 bananas per group. Now, let's find out how many groups of bananas there are. Since there are 93 groups of oranges, we can conclude that there are also 93 groups of bananas. Therefore, the number of groups of bananas is 93. So, the size of each group of bananas is 145 bananas / 93 groups = 1.56 bananas per group.
Response:  We know that there are 192 bananas and they are organized into 345 groups. Therefore, each group of bananas contains an average of $ \frac {192}{345} = 0.55$ bananas. Similarly, we know that there are 384 oranges and they are organized into 16 groups. Therefore, each group of oranges contains an average of $\frac{384}{16} = 24$ oranges.
"Response:  If Brenda made 38 kolaƒçiƒáe for guests and each of them has 19 kolaƒçi (colachis), then we can calculate how many total kolaƒçi she prepared as follows:

Total number of kolaƒçi = Number of kolaƒçiƒáe x Number of kolaƒçi per kolaƒçiƒáe
= 38 x 19
= 702

Therefore, Brenda prepared 702 kolaƒçi for her guests."
"Response:  If Brenda made cookies for 14 people and each person had 30 cookies, then we can calculate how many cookies Brenda prepared as follows:

Brenda made cookies for 14 people = 14 x 30 = 420 cookies
So, Brenda prepared 420 cookies in total."
Response:  If Brenda made 22 cookies and had to throw away 5 of them, that means she has 17 cookies left. Now, if each cookie had the same number of chocolate chips as there are cookies, then we can assume that each cookie has 17 chocolate chips. So, the answer is 17.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 kolaƒçiƒáa and there were 10 guests, each guest would have received 18/10 = 1.8 kolaƒçiƒáa. Since 9 guests did not come, they would not receive any kolaƒçiƒáa. Therefore, the total number of kolaƒçiƒáa distributed is 1.8 + 0 = 1.8 kolaƒçiƒáa.
Response:  If Brenda made 14 cookies for two guests and each cookie had the same number of chocolate chips as there were guests, then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of chocolate chips = Total number of chocolate chips / Number of guests x 2 (since there are two guests) So if Brenda made 14 cookies with the same number of chocolate chips per cookie, then the total number of chocolate chips is equal to 14 x Number of chocolate chips per cookie. Now we need to find out how many chocolate chips are in one cookie. To do that, we can divide the total number of chocolate chips by the number of cookies: Number of chocolate chips per cookie = Total number of chocolate chips / Number of cookies So now we have two equations: Number of chocolate chips = 14 x Number of chocolate chips per cookie Number of chocolate chips per cookie = Total number of chocolate chips / Number of cookies We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of Number of chocolate chips per cookie: Number of chocolate chips per cookie = Total number of chocolate chips / Number of cookies = 14 x Number of chocolate chips per cookie = 14 x Number of chocolate chips per cookie = 140 Number of chocolate chips per cookie Therefore, Brenda made 140 chocolate chips per cookie.
Response:  If Brenda made 10 kolaƒçiƒá for guests and each guest had two kolaƒça, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of kolaƒçiƒá = Total number of guests x Number of kolaƒça per guest  In this case, the total number of guests is given in the problem statement as 5 guests. So, if Brenda prepared 10 kolaƒçiƒá for them, we can calculate the number of kolaƒça she prepared for each guest using the following formula:  Number of kolaƒça per guest = Total number of kolaƒçiƒá / Total number of guests  Substituting the values we know into this formula, we get:  Number of kolaƒça per guest = 10 / 5  = 2 kolaƒça per guest Therefore, Brenda prepared 2 kolaƒça for each of the 5 guests.
Response:  If Frank had 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two boxes, then each box will contain how many pieces of candy?  We can solve this problem using division.  The number of pieces of candy in one box is equal to the total number of pieces of candy divided by 2. So, if Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two boxes, then each box will contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank had 26 boxes of sweets and each box contained 33 pieces of sweets, then the total number of sweets he had was:  Number of sweets = Total number of boxes x Number of pieces in each box  Number of sweets = 26 x 33  Number of sweets = 840  So, Frank had 840 pieces of sweets.
Response:  If Frank had 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them, he has 9 remaining pieces of candy. To find out how many vases each group of candies will go into, we need to divide the number of remaining pieces of candy by the number of groups we want to make (in this case, 3). So, if we divide 9 by 3, we get 3. Therefore, each vase will have 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Frank has put 11 comadas of bombons in each box, then he must have put 11 x 22 = 242 bombons in total. So, if there are 22 boxes, each box must contain 242/22 = 10 bombons. Therefore, Frank has 10 boxes.
Response:  If Frank has put 2 packages of bombons in two boxes, then he must have had 8 bombons in each package (since there are 8 bombons in total). So, if we divide 8 bombons per package by 2 packages, we get 4 bombons in each box. Therefore, there are 4 bombons in each box.
Response:  If she sold 25 boxes of trefoil, and each box contains 14 pieces, then we need to find out how many pieces are in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pieces = Total number of boxes x Number of pieces per box  In this case, the total number of boxes is 25, and the number of pieces per box is 14, so we can plug these values into the equation: Number of pieces = 25 x 14  Number of pieces = 350 pieces  Therefore, if she sold 25 boxes of trefoil, then she needs to deliver 350 pieces in total.
Response:  If she sold 10 boxes of chocolates and each box contains 3 pieces of chocolate, then the total number of chocolates she sold is: 10 x 3 = 30. So, if she needs to deliver 5 boxes of chocolates, then she has 30 / 5 = 6 remaining boxes of chocolates left over for delivery.
Response:  We know that there were 67 flacons of regular boiled and 9 flacons of dietary boiled. To find out how many more flacons of regular boiled soda they had than dietary boiled soda, we need to subtract the number of dietary boiled flacons from the total number of flacons. So, the difference between these two numbers is: 67 - 9 = 58. Therefore, they had 58 more flacons of regular boiled soda than dietary boiled soda.
Response:  We know that there were 22 bottles of regular carbonated beer and 61 bottles of dietary carbonated beer in total. To find out how many more bottles of dietary soda they had than regular soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the number of bottles of dietary soda. So, if there were 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of dietary soda, then the difference between them is 61 - 22 = 39 bottles. Therefore, they had 39 more bottles of dietary soda than regular soda.
Response:  We know that there were 30 flacons of regular carbonated drink and 8 flacons of dietary carbonated drink. So, in total, we have: 30 + 8 = 38 flacons. As for the apples, we are told that there were 41 apples. Therefore, the total number of items is: 38 (flacons) + 41 (apples) = 79 items.
Response:  We know that there were 79 flasks of regular carbonated beer and 53 flasks of dietary carbonated beer. Therefore, we can say that the total number of flasks is equal to 79 + 53 = 132 flasks. Now, let's find out how many more flasks of regular carbonated beer than dietary carbonated beer are present. So, if there are x flasks of regular carbonated beer, then there will be x - 53 flasks of dietary carbonated beer. Since there are 42 jars of apples, we can conclude that the total number of flasks is equal to x + 42 = 132. Solving for x, we get x = 89 flasks of regular carbonated beer. Therefore, there are 89 more flasks of regular carbonated beer than dietary carbonated beer.
"Response:  We know that there were 54 bottles of dietary soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. Since we are asked how many more bottles of regular soda they had than dietary soda, we can subtract the number of dietary soda from the total number of soda bottles:

Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of soda bottles - Number of dietary soda bottles
= 83 - 54
= 29
Therefore, they had 29 more bottles of regular soda than dietary soda."
Response:  We know that there were 17 people in total and 9 of them were ordinary sodas while the rest were diet sodas. So, the number of diet sodas is 9/17 = 0.53 (rounded to nearest whole number). Since each diet soda contains 0.53 liters of gasified water, the total amount of gasified water for all diet sodas is 0.53 x 9 = 4.81 liters. Therefore, the number of flacons of gasified water is 4.81 liters / 0.5 liter per flacon = 9.62 flacons.
"Response:  We know that there were 19 boxes of dietary soda and 60 boxes of regular soda.  To find out how many more boxes of regular soda they had, we can divide the number of regular soda boxes by the number of dietary soda boxes:

Number of regular soda boxes = 60 / 19 = 3.10 (rounded to nearest whole number)
So, they had 3 more boxes of regular soda than dietary soda."
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of regular beer and 32 bottles of diet beer. So altogether we have 104 bottles (72 + 32). Now let's find out how many more jars they had than bottles. According to the question, they had 78 jars of jam. Therefore, we can calculate the number of jars as follows: Number of jars = Total quantity of jams / Quantity of each jar. In this case, the total quantity of jam is 78, and the quantity of each jar is 78/104 = 0.75 jars. So they had approximately 0.75 jars of jam.
Response:  We know that there were 36 jabukas in total and 80 of them were boiled. So, the number of unboiled jabukas is: 36 - 80 = 24. Now we need to find out how many bocas (pieces) each unboiled jabuka had. According to the question, 54 bocas were dietary and 36 bocas were not dietary. Therefore, the number of bocas per unboiled jabuka is: 54 / 36 = 1.5. So, the total number of bocas from all jabukas is: 24 x 1.5 = 36 bocas.
Response:  We know that there were 30 people in total and 28 of them were ordinary sodas, so we can assume that the remaining two were diet sodas. Therefore, the number of diet sodas is 2. Since each diet soda contains 1/4 liter of gasified water, the total amount of gasified water from all diet sodas is 2 x 1/4 = 1/2 liter. So, the number of flacons of gasified water is 1/2 liter.
Response:  We know that there were 4 bottles of dietary drink and 79 more than ordinary juice. So if we have x amount of ordinary juice, then we will have 79 + x amount of dietary drink. Therefore, the total number of bottles is equal to 4x.
Response:  We know that there were 57 ordinary drinks, 26 dietary drinks, and 27 light drinks in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total = Ordinary + Dietary + Light  Total = 57 + 26 + 27  Therefore, the total number of flacons is 100 (57 + 26 + 27).
Response:  We know that there were 81 bottles of regular soda in total. Of those, 60 were diet and 60 were light. So, if we subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of bottles, we get:  Number of regular sodas = Total bottles - Diet sodas  Number of regular sodas = 81 - 60 = 21  Therefore, there were 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of ordinary juice and 40 bottles of dietary juice. So, we can write this as follows:

ordinary juice = 49 x (bottle size)
dietary juice = 40 x (bottle size)

We are also given that there were 6 lightweight juices. So, we can write this as follows:

lightweight juice = 6 x (bottle size)

Now, let's find out how many bottles each type of juice is in total. To do this, we need to multiply the number of bottles of each type of juice by its corresponding volume. For example, if we have 10 bottles of ordinary juice with a volume of 500 ml each, then we have:

ordinary juice = 10 x 500 = 5000 ml

Similarly, for dietary juice, we have:

dietary juice = 30 x 500 = 15000 ml

And for lightweight juice, we have:

lightweight juice = 6 x 250 = 1500 ml

So, now we have the total amount of each type of juice in liters:

ordinary juice = 5000 ml
dietary juice = 15000 ml
lightweight juice = 1500 ml

Finally, we want to know how much each type of juice is in terms of bottles. To do this, we divide the total amount of each type of juice by its corresponding bottle size. For example, to find out how many bottles of ordinary juice we have, we divide 5000 ml by 500 ml per bottle:

ordinary juice = 5000 ml / 500 ml per bottle = 10 bottles

Similarly, for dietary juice, we have:

dietary juice = 15000 ml / 500 ml per bottle = "
Response:  If there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 317 visitors came that day, then the difference between the two days is: 317 - 295 = 22. So, there are 22 more visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to the palace yesterday and today is the 25th day of their visit, then the total number of visitors to the palace in the past 25 days would be:  Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday x Number of days since yesterday  Total visitors = 703 x 25 = 17,550 visitors So, there have been 17,550 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the past 25 days.
Response:  If there were 666 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 100 visitors came after that, then the total number of visitors in two days is: 666 + 100 = 766 visitors. So, there are 304 more visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day.
Response:  If 406 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days and 132 people visited after eating too much jelly, then we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace as follows: Total Number of Visitors = Past Visitors + New Visitors Total Number of Visitors = 406 + (132 x 327) Total Number of Visitors = 406 + 40,940 Total Number of Visitors = 41,346 Therefore, there were 41,346 visitors to Buckingham Palace in the given time period.
Response:  If 45 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before, and there were 829 total visitors in the past 85 days, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:  Number of visitors = Total visitors / Number of days = 829 / 85 = 10 visitors/day Now, let's check how many visitors went to see the bakery that day:  Visitors to the bakery = Number of visitors - Number of visitors who went to Buckingham Palace = 10 - 45 = 35 visitors So, 35 people went to see the bakery that day.
Response:  If there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 71 paintings are displayed inside the palace, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per painting as follows: Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of paintings = 557 / 71 = 7.64 visitors per painting Now, let's assume that the same number of visitors (7.64) visited the palace each of the previous 56 days. Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over those 56 days would be: Total number of visitors = Number of visitors x Number of days = 7.64 x 56 = 409.28 visitors So, if 188 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the previous day, it means that the total number of visitors to the palace over the past 56 days is: Total number of visitors = 409.28 + 188 = 597.28 visitors
Response:  We know that there were 39 pictures in the Baking EM palace and Rachel found out that 661 visitors came to Buckingham Palace that day. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of visitors to Buckingham Palace = Total number of visitors - Number of visitors to Baking EM palace  Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of visitors to Buckingham Palace = 661 - 39 = 622 visitors Number of visitors to Buckingham Palace more than the previous day is equal to the difference between total number of visitors and number of visitors to Baking EM palace minus 39. In other words, if there were x more visitors to Buckingham Palace than the previous day, then: 622 = x + 39  Solving for x, we get: x = 583 Therefore, there were 583 more visitors to Buckingham Palace than the previous day.
Response:  If there were 419 visitors the day before and 103 visitors the day before that, then there were 522 visitors in total before the current day (419 + 103). And if 92 visitors came to see Buckingham Palace today, then the total number of visitors since the previous day is:  Total visitors = Previous day visitors + Today's visitors = 522 + 92 = 614 visitors.
Response:  If there were 471 visitors the day before and 808 visitors the day before that, then there were a total of 471 + 808 = 1279 visitors in the 89 days prior to the current day.  Therefore, if 512 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the current day, the number of visitors per day over the past 89 days is: 1279 / 89 = 14.6 visitors per day.
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 191 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is:

705 - 191 = 514

If we add this number to the total number of visitors from the previous 245 days (which was 457), we get:

457 + 514 = 971

So, in the past 245 days, more than 971 people visited Buckingham Palace."
Response:  We know that the wool needs to be glued and it requires an additional 159g of glue. So, we need to find out how much glue is already there. According to the problem, the wool already has 479g of glue. Therefore, the total amount of glue needed is: 159g + 479g = 638g.
Response:  We know that the total amount of paint needed is 49 g, and we have 260 g of paint available. To find out how much paint each item requires, we can divide the total amount of paint needed by the number of items required: 49 g / 3 = 16 g per item (since there are 3 items in total). So, if the feathers require 288 g of glue, then we will need to use 16 g + 16 g + 16 g = 58 g of glue for all three feathers.
Response:  We know that the total amount of paint needed to paint all the feathers is 57 g, and we also know that each feather requires 353 g of glue. So, if he has already used 22 g of glue, then he still needs to use (57 - 22) = 35 g more glue to complete the job.
Response:  If it takes 166 grams of wax to join feathers and he has 20 grams of wax left, then he needs more wax. So, he needs (166 - 20) = 146 grams more wax.
"Response:  If we have 557 grams of wax and we need only 17 grams to connect the feathers, then we can calculate how much wax is left over as follows:

557 - 17 = 540 grams of wax remaining
So, we have 540 grams of wax left over after connecting the feathers with the wax."
"Response:  If there are currently 11 g of wax and the feather requires an total of 492 g of wax, then we can calculate how much more wax is needed as follows:

Total amount of wax required = 492 g
Current amount of wax available = 11 g

To find out how many additional grams of wax are needed, we subtract the current amount from the total amount:
Additional amount of wax needed = Total amount - Current amount
= 492 g - 11 g
= 481 g

Therefore, the person needs an additional 481 grams of wax to complete the task."
Response:  If it takes 6 days to fill 90 barrels of grape juice and there are 94 farmers working together, then each farmer can fill approximately 1/2 barrel per day (90 / 94 = 0.57). So, daily production would be around 57 barrels.
Response:  If it takes 5 days to fill 266 barrels of wine, then each day will be able to fill how many barrels?  So, if we divide 266 by 5, we get that each day can fill 53 barrels of wine.
"Response:  If we have to fill 244 baskets of grapes every day for 146 days, then we will need a total of:

$$ NumberOfBaskets = 146 \times 244 = 34,584 $$

So, there would be $34,584$ baskets of grapes in total."
Response:  If there are 221 burads of grapes and each burat can hold 20 ml of grape juice, then we have a total capacity of 4420 ml (221 x 20). Now, if Kao fills his jar every day with 100 burats of grapes, he will need 77 days to fill it completely since there are only 4420 ml in total. Therefore, the number of burats of grapes that Kao can fill his jar with per day is: Number of burats = Total capacity / Number of days = 4420 ml / 77 days = 56.89 burats per day
"Response:  If Kao's favorite grape variety is filled with 108 bunches of grapes per day and he has been doing this for 58 days, then the total number of bunches of grapes that Kao has filled during this period can be calculated as follows:

Total number of bunches = Number of days x Number of bunches per day
= 58 days x 108 bunches/day
= 6,344 bunches
Therefore, Kao has filled approximately 6,344 bunches of grapes during the given period."
Response:  If it takes 8 grape pickers 36 days to fill 240 baskets of grapes, that means each picker can fill 7 baskets in one day (240/36). Now, if we have 36 pickers working together, they will be able to fill 216 baskets in one day (7 x 36 = 252, but we need 240). So, it will take them 2 days to fill all 240 baskets (252 - 240 = 12). Therefore, the answer is 12 days.
"Response:  If there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has the same number of saltwater animals as the total number of aquariums, then we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of saltwater animals in each aquarium = Total number of aquariums x Number of saltwater animals per aquarium

We know that the total number of aquariums is 26, so let's call it ""A"". We also know that the number of saltwater animals per aquarium is equal to the total number of aquariums (26), so let's call it ""B"". Therefore, we can write the equation:

Number of saltwater animals in each aquarium = A x B

Now, we need to find out what values A and B could be. From the question, we know that the total number of saltwater animals in all the aquariums is 52. So, if we divide the total number of saltwater animals by the number of aquariums, we get:

Number of saltwater animals in each aquarium = 52 / 26

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

Number of saltwater animals in each aquarium = 2

So, each aquarium contains 2 saltwater animals."
Response:  We know that there are 40 saltwater aquariums in total and each aquarium has at least two fish. So, we can start with the number of aquariums: 40 x 2 = 80. Therefore, there were 80 aquariums in total.
Response:  If Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater and 10 for freshwater animals, that means he has a total of 66 aquariums.  Since each aquarium can hold up to 39 fish or other sea creatures, Tyler has a total of 66 x 39 = 2748 marine animals in his collection!
Response:  If Tyler has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals, then he has a total of 3,396 (74 x 46) freshwater animals. Similarly, if he has 22 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals, then he has a total of 988 (22 x 46) saltwater animals. Therefore, Tyler has a total of 4,384 marine animals (3,396 + 988).
"Response:  For saltwater aquariums, there are 15 aquariums and each aquarium has 19 fish, so the total number of fish for saltwater aquariums is:

15 x 19 = 285

For freshwater aquariums, there are 62 aquariums and each aquarium has 19 fish, so the total number of fish for freshwater aquariums is:

62 x 19 = 1178

Therefore, the total number of fish in both types of aquariums is:

285 + 1178 = 1463

So, there are 1463 fish in total."
"Response:  If bijele majice are sold in packages of 13 pieces each, then we know that the number of packages needed to buy 39 white shirts is:

$$ \text {Number of packages} = \divide \text{Total number of shirts by Number of shirts per package} $$

So, if we have $39$ white shirts and each package contains $13$ shirts, then we need:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of packages}} = \divide{39}{13} = 3 $$

Therefore, your mother will receive $3$ packages of white shirts."
"Response:  If Mama buys 66 white shirts and each package contains 3 white shirts, then she will have:

66 / 3 = 22 packages of white shirts
Therefore, Mama will have 22 packages of white shirts."
Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages of white dresses and each package contains 56 white dresses, then we can calculate how many white dresses are in each package as follows: Number of white dresses in each package = Total number of white dresses / Number of packages = 56 white dresses / 28 packages = 2 white dresses per package. Therefore, there are 2 white dresses in each package.
Response:  If bijele majice are sold in packages of 53 pieces each, then we know that there are 53 x 57 = 2911 bijele majice in total. Since Mama bought 34 pairs of pants, she did not buy all the available bijele majice. Therefore, the number of bijele majice left is equal to the total number minus the number of bijele majice Mama bought: 2911 - 34 = 2877 bijele majice.
Response:  If mama buys 51 white t-shirts and each package contains 3 shirts, then... (1)...Mama has bought 51 / 3 = 17 packages of t-shirts.
Response:  If Mama buys 70 white shirts in total and each package contains 14 white shirts, then we can calculate as follows: Number of packages = Total number of shirts / Number of shirts per package = 70 / 14 = 5 packages. Therefore, there are 5 packages of white shirts that Mama bought.
Response:  If we have 4 baskets with an equal number of cookies and there are 36 cookies in total, then each basket has 9 cookies (36 / 4 = 9).
Response:  We have 33 kolaƒçiƒáa in total and each container has 11 kolaƒçiƒáa. Therefore, we have:  Number of containers = Total number of kolaƒçiƒáa / Number of kolaƒçiƒáa per container = 33 / 11 = 3 containers.
"Response:  If each vreƒáa has 41 kolaƒçiƒá, and you have 53 vreƒáe kolaƒçiƒáa, then...

Answer: You have 53 x 41 = 2191 kolaƒçiƒá!"
Response:  We have 14 kolaƒçiƒáa in total and we want to divide them equally among 7 vreƒáe (baskets). To do this, we need to find out how many kolaƒçiƒáa each vreƒáa can hold.  We know that there are an equal number of kolaƒçiƒáa in each vreƒáa, so if one vreƒáa has x kolaƒçiƒáa, then all 7 vreƒáa together will have 7x kolaƒçiƒáa.  Therefore, the number of kolaƒçiƒáa in each vreƒáa is 7x/7 = x.  So, if we divide 14 kolaƒçiƒáa among 7 vreƒáe, each vreƒáa will contain x = 2 kolaƒçiƒáa.
"Response:  If each jar has 3 marbles and you have 21 marbles in total, then we can calculate how many jars of marbles you have as follows:

Number of jars = Total number of marbles / Number of marbles per jar
= 21 marbles / 3 marbles per jar
= 7 jars
Therefore, you have 7 jars of marbles."
Response:  We have 26 vreƒáa with equal number of balls (kolaƒçiƒáa). So, total number of balls is 26 x 3 = 78. Now we know that you have 15 sweets and 52 balls in total. Therefore, each vreƒáa has 52 / 26 = 2 balls. So, you have 2 balls per vreƒáa.
Response:  If you have 14 bags with equal number of cookies and each bag has 28 cookies, then total number of cookies is:  Number of bags = 14  Total number of cookies = Number of cookies in each bag x Number of bags = 28 x 14 = 376 cookies. Now, if you also have 86 pieces of candy, then total number of sweets is: Total number of sweets = Number of candies + Number of cookies = 86 + 376 = 462 sweets. So, you have 462 sweets in total.
Response: 1) Postman must send 5 unwanted letters to each block. So, in total, he will send 5 x 5 = 25 unwanted letters. 2) Now, if he sends 25 letters to each house in the block, there are 5 houses in each block. Therefore, he will send a total of 25 x 5 = 125 letters.
Response: 1. Postman must send 9 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block. 2. There are 20 houses in each block. So, he needs to send 9 x 20 = 180 pieces of unwanted mail in total.
Response:  If there are 6 houses in each block and the postman needs to send 24 packages of mail to each block, then he will need to send a total of 24 x 6 = 144 packages of mail overall.
"Response:  If Postar gives 14 invalid messages to each house in the block, and he has to give two pieces of unwanted mail to every block, then the number of houses in each block is:

14 / 2 = 7

So there are 7 houses in each block."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the postman needs to send 32 pieces of mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of mail that need to be sent is:  20 x 32 = 640 pieces of mail. Therefore, the answer is 640.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many total number of households are there in all 78 blocks. Since there are 19 houses in each block, and there are 78 blocks in total, the total number of households would be:

Number of households = Number of blocks x Number of houses per block
= 78 x 19
= 1462 households

Now, since Postar must send 30 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 78 blocks, the total number of pieces of unwanted mail he needs to send is:

Total number of unwanted mails = Total number of households x Number of pieces of unwanted mail per household
= 1462 households x 30
= 4386 pieces of unwanted mail

Therefore, Postar must send 4386 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 78 blocks."
Response:  Postman must send 8 unwanted letters to each of the 55 blocks, so in total he must send 440 unwanted letters (55 blocks x 8 letters per block). Now, if he sends 32 messages to each house in the block, there are 32 houses in each block, and since there are 55 blocks in total, he will have sent a total of 1760 messages (55 blocks x 32 messages per block).
Response:  Postman must deliver 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house in every block of 81 blocks. So, we need to find out how many pieces of unwanted mail he needs to deliver in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of houses in each block (12) by the number of blocks (81). Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 960 pieces of unwanted mail in total (12 x 81 = 960).
Response:  If Postman has to send 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each of the 16 blocks, then he needs to send a total of 4 x 16 = 64 pieces of unwanted mail in all.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles. If she wants to divide them into groups of 4, we need to find out how many groups she can make. To do this, we can use division. Division is when you divide one number by another to get a group or portion of something. In this case, we are dividing 20 (the total number of marbles) by 4 (the number of marbles in each group). So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get 5. This means that Rebecca can make 5 groups of 4 marbles each using all of her marbles. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs to share among groups of 5 people each. To find out how many groups she can make, we need to divide the total number of objects (marbles + eggs) by 5. So, we will divide 10 + 15 = 25 by 5: 25 / 5 = 5 groups. Therefore, Rebecca can create 5 groups with her collection of marbles and eggs.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide her collection of eggs into groups of 11, then she will have 11 groups in total. Since each group has 2 eggs, Rebecca will have a total of 22 eggs (11 x 2 = 22). Therefore, Rebecca has 22 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 jaja and she wants to divide them into 4 groups. Since there are 6 kuglica, we can assume that each group will have at least 2 jaja (since 6 / 4 = 1.5). So, let's round up to 3 jaja per group. Therefore, each group will have 3 jaja.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. If she wants to divide them into three groups, we can assume that each group will have an equal number of marbles and eggs. So, let's start by dividing the marbles equally among the three groups: Group 1 will get 2 marbles (since there are 4 marbles total), Group 2 will get 1 marble (since there are now only 3 marbles left), and Group 3 will also get 1 marble (since there are now only 2 marbles left). Now, let's distribute the remaining eggs equally among the three groups: Group 1 will get 5 eggs (since there are 15 eggs total), Group 2 will get 3 eggs (since there are now only 12 eggs left), and Group 3 will get 7 eggs (since there are now only 9 eggs left). Therefore, the number of eggs in each group is: Group 1 - 5 eggs, Group 2 - 3 eggs, and Group 3 - 7 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and wants to divide them into groups of 6. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs. To do this, we can use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 18 by 6 to see how many groups we can make.  When we divide 18 by 6, we get 3. This means that Rebecca can make 3 groups of 6 eggs each.  Now let's consider the other information given in the problem. We know that Rebecca also has 72 bananas and 66 kuglica (which are probably small balls). These items don't affect the number of groups Rebecca can make with her eggs, so we can ignore them for now.  Therefore, the final answer is:  Groups = 3
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 3, then each group will have 3 bananas and 1 egg. Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed is: Number of groups = Total amount of items / Amount per group = 99 + 9 = 108 groups So there will be 108 groups of 3 bananas and 1 egg each.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 5. So, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with these eggs.  Number of groups = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs in each group  Number of groups = 20 eggs / 5 eggs per group  Number of groups = 4 groups  Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than kuglica (balls).
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 20, then we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources. To do this, we will use division.  Division is a way of dividing a number into equal parts or groups. In this case, we want to divide 12 eggs (the total number of eggs) into groups of 20. So, we will divide 12 by 20, which gives us 0.6. This means that Rebecca can make 0.6 groups of 20 eggs each using her 12 eggs. Since there are no remainders when dividing by 20, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which is 1 group of 20 eggs. Therefore, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles. The difference between the number of eggs and marbles is 9 (12 - 5).
Response:  If Luke played trivia games and scored 154 points, that means he scored an average of 12 points per game (since there are 13 questions in each round). So if he played x rounds, then his total score would be 12x. Since we know he scored 154 points, we can set up the equation: 12x = 154. Solving for x, we get: x = 12. Therefore, Luke played 12 rounds.
"Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds of trivial game and scored 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total points} = \text {Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round} $$

So, the total number of points scored by Luke is:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total points}} = 177 \times 46 = 8322 $$
Therefore, Luke has scored 8322 points in the game."
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after two rounds of trivial game and he got the same number of points in each round as many points he scored in one round, then we can write an equation: Points = x Where x is the number of points Luke scored in one round. Since Luke scored 42 points in the first round and 42 points in the second round, we can substitute these values into our equation to solve for x: Points = x 42 + 42 = x Now, we need to isolate variable x. We can do this by subtracting 42 from both sides of the equation: x = 40 Therefore, Luke scored 40 points in one round.
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in each round of the game, then he would have scored a total of 146 x 157 = 21,982 points in the entire game.
"Response:  If Luke scored 78 points in a game of trivia and he received 3 points for each round, then we can calculate the number of rounds played as follows:

Round count = Total score / Score per round
= 78 / 3
= 26 rounds
Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the game of trivia."
Response:  If Emily had 2 pearls and could make 32 ohrlices, then she must have made 16 pairs of ohrlices (since each pair requires two pearls). So, to find out how many crowns were needed for each ohrlica, we can divide the number of crowns required for one ohrlica by the number of ohrlices she made in total. Therefore, the answer is 16/32 = 4 crowns per ohrlica.
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 ogrlic and each ogrlica contains 28 pearls. Therefore, the total number of pearls Emily had is: 11 x 28 = 308 pearls. So, there are 308 pearls in total.
Response:  If each ogrlica has 8 kruneta and Emily has 16 kruneta, then she can make 2 times more ogrlica than usual. So, the number of ogrlica Emily can make is:  2 x 8 = 16 ogrlica.
Response:  If Emily had 6 crowns and she made 18 ogrlices for her friends, then we can calculate how many crowns were needed to make one ogrlice as follows: Number of crowns = Total number of ogrlices / Number of ogrlices made at once To find out how many crowns were needed to make one ogrlice, we need to divide the total number of ogrlices (18) by the number of ogrlices made at once (1). So, the answer is: Number of crowns = 18 / 1 = 18 crowns. Therefore, Emily needed 18 crowns to make each ogrlice.
Response:  If each friend takes 5 perls from Emily and she made 4 ogrlices, then the total number of perls taken is 4 x 5 = 20 perls. So, Emily had 20 perls in total.
"Response:  If Emily has 72 friends and each friend needs an earring made of pearl for one ear, then she will need to make 72 x 1 = 72 earrings in total. Since each earring requires 3 crowns, Emily will need to make 72 x 3 = 216 crowns in total. Therefore, Emily can make 216 ogrlicas (a combination of ""ogrlica"" and ""crowns"")."
Response:  If Emily has 5 pearls and can make 20 ohridas with them, then she will have to use each pearl 4 times (since there are 20 ohridas that need to be made). So, we can write:  Number of pearls = Total number of ohridases / Number of uses per pearl  In this case, we have:  Number of pearls = 5 / 4 = 1.25 pearls per ohrida  Therefore, Emily needed approximately 1.25 krunica for each ohrida she made.
Response:  We know that Emily has 44 friends and she made 26 ogrlicas. So, each friend received one ogrlica. Since each ogrlica contains two pearls, we can conclude that Emily used 2 x 26 = 52 pearls to make all those ogrlicas. Therefore, there were 52 pearls in total for Emily.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County who went to camp and 668278 children who stayed at home. So, we have a total of 1487836 children. Now, we need to find out how many more children were in the camp than at home. To do this, we can divide the number of children in the camp (819058) by the total number of children (1487836). This gives us a ratio of 57.3% or approximately 58%. Therefore, about 58% of the children from Lawrence County spent their summer vacation at camp, while the remaining 42% stayed at home.
Response:  We know that out of 1,000,000 children in the county, 937,500 (93.75%) went to camp and 62,500 (6.25%) stayed at home. So, there are 62,500 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp. Therefore, the answer is 62,500.
Response:  We know that 629424 children go to camp and 898051 are left at home. So, the number of children who stay at home is equal to the total number minus the number who went to camp: 629424 - 898051 = -270583 children. Therefore, there are -270583 children who stay at home.
Response:  We know that there are 313.473 people in total and 274.865 of them stay at home during summer vacation. So, the number of people who go to camp is:  Number of people going to camp = Total number of people - Number of people staying at home  Number of people going to camp = 313.473 - 274.865  Number of people going to camp = 38.608 people
Response:  We are given that during summer vacation, 907611 children from the district of Lawrence stay at home while 455682 other children go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children there are in total in the district of Lawrence. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who stay at home (907611) by the ratio of children who go to camp to those who stay at home (455682/907611). Therefore, the answer is:  Children in the district of Lawrence = 907611 x (455682 / 907611) = 388058 children.
Response:  We know that out of 828521 children in the entire county, 800059 go to summer camp. This means that 426662 (828521 - 800059) children remain at home. Therefore, there are 426662 children remaining at home.
Response:  We know that out of 91676 children in the district of Lawrence, 61619 stayed at home while the rest went to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children at camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home Number of children at camp = 91676 - 61619 Number of children at camp = 30057 Therefore, there were 30057 children at the summer camp in the Lawrence district.
Response:  We know that out of 34044 children from the district of Lawrence, 34044 x 5 = 170220 children stayed at home.  Therefore, the total number of children who went to camp is equal to 134867 + 424944 - 170220 = 237567 children.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children from the district of Lawrence, 590796 remained at home while 22 children from abroad attended camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children remaining at home = 590796. Now, let‚Äôs find out how many children went to camp: Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children remaining at home Number of children going to camp = 610769 - 590796 = 200903 Therefore, there are 200903 children who went to camp from the district of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children at home and 893835 children went to camp. So, the total number of children is: 644997 + 893835 = 1538832. Therefore, there are 1538832 children in the district of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that Adam has more than three apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has 9 apples and he has more than 3, then Jackie must have less than 6 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 5 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jake has 2 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples Jake has from the total number of apples Adam has, we will get the difference between their apple collections. Therefore, the answer is:  Adam has 8 more apples than Jake (10 - 2 = 8).
Response:  If Adam has 9 apples and Jeki has 10 apples, then we can say that Adam has fewer apples than Jeki. So, the number of apples that Adam has is less than 10 (the number of apples Jeki has). Therefore, the answer to the question is: More than 10 apples.
Response:  We know that D≈æeki has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that D≈æeki has, we get: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more apples than Adam has.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jake have 6 apples together. If we subtract the number of apples they have from the total number of apples, we get:  Total number of apples = 6 (Adam + Jake) - 6 (Adam + Jake) = 0 So, there are no apples left! Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have more than 9 apples together. So, if they have x apples, then Adam has x/2 apples and Jackie has (x-9) apples. Since Adam and D≈æeki have 7 apples together, we can write:

Adam's share = x/2
D≈æeki's share = (x - 9)

Now we need to solve for x. We are given that Adam and Jackie have more than 9 apples together, so x > 9. Also, we know that Adam and D≈æeki have 7 apples together, so their total number of apples is:

Total = Adam's share + D≈æeki's share = (x/2) + 7

Substituting the values, we get:

Total = (x/2) + 7

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, Adam and Jackie have 16 apples together, and Adam has 8 apples and Jackie has 8 apples."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jake have 12 apples in total. So, if we subtract the number of apples they both have (9), then we are left with the difference between their individual shares. Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jake. Now, let's convert this information into numbers:  Adam - Jake = 8  So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jake. In other words, Adam has 40 apples (12 - 9 + 8) and Jake has 32 apples (12 - 9).
Response:  We know that Adam has more than 4 apples and less than or equal to 8 apples.  Since Jake also has some apples, we can say that Adam has at least 2 apples more than Jake. So, if Jake has x apples, then Adam has x + 2 apples. Now, we are told that there are 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together have. Therefore, the total number of apples they have is: x + 2 + 6 =?. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. So, Adam has 8 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, then Adam must have at least 89 + 11 = 100 apples. Therefore, Adam has 100 apples.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen baked 31 cookies. Today, she will bake 270 more cookies. That means she has already baked a total of 301 cookies (31 + 270). And tomorrow, she will bake an additional 419 cookies, so in total, Helen has baked 719 cookies until now (301 + 419 = 719). Therefore, the correct answer is 719.
Response:  Yesterday (last night), Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies. Today (morning), she will bake 51 more chocolate cookies and 484 chocolate cookies in total. So, the final number of chocolate cookies that Helen will have baked is: 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday (yesteray), Helen made 86 kolaƒçiƒáa of grapes and 527 chocolate truffles. Today (today), she made 86 more kolaƒçiƒáa of grapes and 554 more chocolate truffles. So, in total, Helen made 172 kolaƒçiƒáa of grapes today and 681 chocolate truffles. Therefore, the number of chocolate truffles Helen peeled is: 681 - 527 = 154.
Response:  Yesterday (yesterda), Helen baked 397 kolaƒçiƒáa of grapes and today she will bake 85 more. So, in total, Helen has baked 397 + 85 = 482 kolaƒçiƒáa of grapes.
Response:  Yesterday (last night), Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies. Today (this morning), she will bake 237 more chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 256 chocolate cookies (19 + 237). Now, let's find out how many chocolate cookies are more than the number of raisin cookies that Helen baked. The number of raisin cookies that Helen baked is given as 231. Therefore, we can subtract the number of raisin cookies from the total number of chocolate cookies to get the difference between them: 256 - 231 = 25. So, there are 25 more chocolate cookies than the number of raisin cookies that Helen baked.
Response:  Yesterday (juƒçer), Helen peeled 197 chocolate kisses and 46 fruit kisses. Today (danas), she baked 75 fruit kisses and 66 chocolate kisses. So, yesterday, Helen peeled more chocolate kisses than today - 197 vs 66. Therefore, the difference between the number of chocolate kisses Helen peeled yesterday and today is 131 (197 - 66).
Response:  Yesterday (yesterday), Helen made 300 kolaƒçiƒáa of fruit and today she made 280 more kolaƒçiƒáa of fruit. So, in total, Helen made 580 kolaƒçiƒáa of fruit yesterday and today. Now, let's compare it to the number of chocolate kisses she made. Yesterday, Helen made 519 chocolate kisses, which is less than the number of kolaƒçiƒáa of fruit she made. Today, she made 359 more chocolate kisses, so in total, Helen made 878 chocolate kisses yesterday and today. Therefore, there are more chocolate kisses than kolaƒçiƒáa of fruit that Helen made yesterday and today.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games in total. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:

81 - 59 = 22

Therefore, Katie has 22 more games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So, we can say that their total number of games is 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, let's find out how many games Katie's old friends have. According to the question, they have 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games among all Katie's friends is 179 - 53 = 126 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 84 video games and her friends have 8 new games + 69 old games = 77 games in total. So, together they have 84 (Katie) + 77 (friends) = 161 video games. Therefore, the number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 8.
Response:  We know that Katie had 62 new games and her friends had 73 new games. So together they have 62 + 73 = 135 new games. Now we need to find out how many old games they had. According to the question, Katie had 80 old games and her friends had 41 old games, so their total number of old games is 80 + 41 = 121 old games. Therefore, the number of old games that Katie's friend has is 121 - 80 = 41 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games in total. So, to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 63 - 57 = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie had 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 57 + 39 = 96 games.  Now, we are told that her friends have 34 new games. So, let's subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of games Katie has: 96 - 34 = 62. Therefore, Katie has more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and then he spent $20 on something. So, his remaining amount of money is now $40. Then, Jason started working over the weekend and earned $33. Now, let's calculate how much money Jason earned after spending $20 on something: $33 - $20 = $13. Therefore, Jason earned $13 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 and then he spent $10 on something. So now he has $76. Then, Jason had $5 and didn't work over the weekend, so he still has $5. Therefore, together they have $76 + $5 = $81.
"Response: 
Fred had $19 at the beginning of the weekend and earned $21 during the weekend (since he has $40 now). So, his total earnings are: $19 + $21 = $30.
Jason had $16 at the beginning of the weekend and earned $43 during the weekend (since he has $69 now). So, his total earnings are: $16 + $43 = $59."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and lost $33, so he has $81 left. Secondly, we know that Jason started with $22 and gained $56, so he has $78 now. Finally, we are told that they both earned money over the weekend, but only Fred worked, so Jason did not earn any more money. Therefore, Jason still has $78. So, the answer is $78.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and then he earned $4 over the weekend, so now he has $115. Similarly, Jason started with $40 and earned $6 from delivering newspapers, so now he has $46. Therefore, they both gained $29 in total ($115 - $86).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $49 last week and he earned $73 this week, so his new amount of money is: $49 + ($73 x 1.12) = $508. Similarly, for Jason, he had $3 last week and he earned $37 this week, so his new amount of money is: $3 + ($37 x 1.12) = $40. Therefore, they both earned $508 and $40 respectively from delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $90 after mowing lawns over the weekend and adding that to his original $78 gives him a total of $168. Secondly, Jason started with $31 and now has $14 left, so he made $18 in total. Therefore, they both earned $168 + $18 = $186 in delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, Fred earned $33 from selling newspapers and $74 from washing cars. Therefore, his total earnings for the weekend are:  $33 + $74 = $107. So, Fred earned $107 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and he spent $111 for newspapers and $34 for car washing. So his remaining balance after these expenses would be: $47 - $111 =-$64. Then, we are told that Jason had $99 last week. Therefore, if we subtract Fred's remaining balance from Jason's initial amount, we get: $99 - ($64) = $35. So, Fred has $35 left now.
Response:  If she started at 71 kg and lost 20 kg per day, then after one day she would have lost 20 kg = 400 g (since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram). So now she weighs 71 - 400 = 339 kg. Since she continued to run every day for another week, let's assume that she lost an additional 20 kg x 7 = 140 kg during this time period. Therefore, her final weight is 339 + 140 = 479 kg.
Response:  We know that Jelena currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg since she started running every day. So, to find out how much she weighed before starting to run, we can subtract the amount she has lost from her current weight: 27 - 101 = -74 kg. Therefore, Jelena was -74 kg heavy before she started running.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 182 kg (126 + 56). Now she weighs 66 kg. So, her weight loss is equal to her initial weight minus her current weight: 182 - 66 = 116 kg. Therefore, Jessie initially weighed 116 kg before starting to run every day.
Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. After running every day for 2 months, she lost 35 kg, which means she now weighs 34 kg (69 - 35 = 34).
Response:  In the first week, she lost 50 kg = 114 kg / 2 = 57 kg.  In the second week, she lost another 60 kg = 57 kg x 1.1 = 63 kg. So now she weighs 63 kg.
Response:  We know that she started at 9 kg and lost weight in each of the first two weeks as follows: Week 1: -62 kg / 7 days = -8.7 kg/day Week 2: -140 kg / 7 days = -20 kg/day Therefore, her initial weight was 9 kg + (8.7 kg/day x 7 days) + (20 kg/day x 7 days) = 9 kg + 57 kg + 140 kg = 206 kg So, her original weight before starting to run was 206 kg.
Response:  First week (sedmi): Day 1 - started with weight of 92 kg, lost 56 kg = new weight is 36 kg. Day 7 - lost additional 99 kg = new weight is 0 kg. So after first week, she weighed 0 kg.
Response:  We know that there were 95 snakes and 61 alligators in the zoo enclosure. If we assume that each snake takes up half as much space as an alligator (since they are smaller), then we can estimate how many snakes fit in the enclosure. So, if we divide the total volume of the enclosure by the volume of one snake, we get: Volume of enclosure = 95 + 61 = 156 cubic meters. Volume of one snake = 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125 cubic meters. Therefore, number of snakes = Total volume of enclosure / Volume of one snake = 156 / 0.125 = 1280 snakes. Since we already knew that there were 95 snakes in the enclosure, this means that there are 330 additional snakes that could potentially be hiding somewhere else in the enclosure!
Response:  We know that in the zoo there were 93 snakes and 97 alligators. If we take away 40 alligators from this number, then the remaining number of alligators will be:  $97 - 40 = 57$ alligators are left. So, there are 57 alligators left after taking away 40 alligators from the original number.
Response:  We know that in the zoo there were initially 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If we add 82 more snakes, then the total number of snakes will be 82 + 3 = 85 snakes. Now, let's find out how many alligators are left after adding 82 new alligators to the initial 19 alligators. So, the total number of alligators is 75 + 19 = 94 alligators. Therefore, 94 - 85 = 9 aligators do not fit in the enclosure.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the zoo enclosure. If we subtract the number of snakes (24) and alligators (51), we get: 79 - 24 = 55. So, there are 55 other animals besides snakes and alligators in the enclosure.
Response:  If farmer had 171 peppers in his garden yesterday and today he chose 134 of them, then he has 37 peppers left (171 - 134 = 37).
"Response:  If farmer had 160 paradajza in his garden and he took 56 yesterday and 41 today, then we can calculate how many are left from yesterday's harvest as follows:

Yesterday (56) + Today (41) = Total taken = 97
So, there were 160 - 97 = 63 paradajza left from yesterday's harvest."
"Response:  If farmer had 90 parades in his garden and he took 154 juice yesterday and 50 today, then we can calculate how many parades he collected as follows:

Yesterday (154 juice):
Parades = Juice / Price per parade
= 154 / $2
= 77 parades

Today (50 juice):
Parades = Juice / Price per parade
= 50 / $2
= 25 parades

Total number of parades collected = Yesterday + Today
= 77 + 25
= 102 parades

Therefore, the farmer has collected 102 parades."
Response:  If farmer had 175 parades and bought 172 krumper, then he has 3 (175 - 172) parades left. So, the number of parades is 3.
Response:  If farmer had 177 paradajza and 12 krumpira in his garden before buying 53 more paradajza, then he has now (after buying) 177 + 53 = 230 paradajza. Since he already had 12 krumpira, so now he has 230 + 12 = 242 plants in total.
Response:  If farmer had initially 105 green parrots and 71 red parrots in his garden, then he bought 137 more parrots. So, the total number of parrots he has now is:  Green parrots = 105 + 137 = 242 Red parrots = 71 + 0 = 71 Therefore, there are 242 green parrots and 71 red parrots in the farmer's garden after he bought additional ones.
Response:  If Za used 4 chisels to cut out large pieces of wood for the walls, and each piece requires 2 chisel marks to be fixed, then we can calculate how many chisel marks John needs as follows: Number of wooden pieces = Total number of chisel marks needed = 4 x 2 = 8 chisel marks So, John needs 8 chisel marks to fix the large pieces of wood for the walls.
Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden beams and we need 17 pieces of wood for each beam. So, in total, we need 249 pieces of wood (13 x 17 = 249). Now, we also know that John needs 8 additional pieces of wood for some smaller beams. Therefore, the final number of pieces of wood needed is 249 + 8 = 257.
Response:  If it takes 3 pieces of rope to secure each large sheet of wood and they used additional 8 pieces of rope, then the total number of pieces of rope used would be: 3 x (number of large sheets of wood) + 8 =?  So if John needs 11 large sheets of wood for his house, he will need: 3 x 11 = 33 pieces of rope in total.
Response:  We know that big planks need 15 pieces of rope to secure them and small planks need 5 pieces of rope to secure them together. So if we want to secure all the planks for the wall, we will need 15 + 5 = 20 pieces of rope in total. Now, let's assume that John has already secured half of the planks with his current supply of ropes (let's call it x). Then, we can calculate how many ropes he needs to get the remaining planks as follows: Number of ropes needed = Total number of planks / Amount of planks secured so far = 20 / x = 4x. Therefore, John needs 4 times the amount of ropes he has currently to secure all the planks for the wall.
Response:  We know that D≈æon has to use 16 dasaka for the wall of his house. Each dasak requires 2 chavls, so we need to calculate how many chavls will be required in total. Therefore, the number of chavls needed is: 16 dasaka x 2 chavls/dasak = 32 chavls.
Response:  We know that there are 8 large wooden boards used for the house. Each board requires 74 pieces of nails to be fixed. So, we need to calculate how many nails John needs in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of boards by the number of nails required per board: Number of nails needed = Number of boards x Number of nails per board  Number of boards = 8  Number of nails per board = 74  Therefore, John needs a total of: Number of nails needed = 8 x 74 = 592 nails.
Response:  We know that for each large plate, John needs to use 12 plates and for each small plate, he needs to use 17 plates. So in total, John needs to use 12 x 12 = 144 plates of large size and 17 x 17 = 289 plates of small size. Therefore, the number of plates needed by John is 144 + 289 = 433 plates.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of candy in total and each package contains 3 pieces of candy. Therefore, we can calculate the number of packages as follows: Number of packages = Total number of candies / Number of candies per package = 42 / 3 = 14 packages So, Robin has 14 packages of candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packets of candy and each packet contains 23 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that Robin has is: 43 x 23 = 1005. However, we are also given that Robin has 8 pieces of candy in addition to the ones he already has. So, the final number of candies that Robin has is: 1005 + 8 = 1013. Therefore, the answer is 1013.
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 pieces of chewing gum and each package contains 7 pieces. Therefore, the number of packages Robin has is:  Number of packages = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package  Number of pieces per package = 7 (since each package contains 7 pieces) Total number of pieces = 6 + 6 +... + 6 = 41 (since Robin has 6 pieces in total) So, the number of packages Robin has is: Number of packages = 41 / 7 = 5 packages.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and each packet contains 4 pieces of gum. Therefore, Robin has 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum in total.
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packets of chocolate and each packet contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies that Robin has is:

21 packets x 9 pieces/packet = 189 pieces of candy
So, there are 189 pieces of candy in total that Robin has."
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and 14 packets of candy. In each packet, there are 6 pieces of gum or candy. So, we can calculate the total number of pieces of gum and candy as follows: Gum: 28 packets x 6 pieces/packet = 168 pieces of gum Candy: 14 packets x 6 pieces/packet = 84 pieces of candy Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 pieces of gum and 84 pieces of candy.
Response:  If an industrial machine can make 3 t-shirts in one minute and altogether they have made 6 t-shirts, then we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked. We know that the machine makes 3 t-shirts per minute, so it worked for:  Minutes = Number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts per minute  Minutes = 6 / 3  Minutes = 2  Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes.
Response:  If an industrial machine worked for 5 minutes and can make 4 shirts in one minute, then it made 20 shirts during those 5 minutes (4 x 5 = 20). So, the answer is 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday (9 majica), today (44 majice). So total = 53 majice. If she can make 3 majice in minute, then time taken to make one majic = Total number of majice / Number of majice made per minute = 53/3 = 17 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 17 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in total. If it can make 8 dresses per minute, then it worked for...  Total time = Number of items / Rate (items/minute) = 13 / 8 = 150 minutes. So, the machine worked for 150 minutes yesterday and today combined.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total. If it can make 2 t-shirts per minute, then it worked for...  Minutes = Total number of shirts / Number of t-shirts per minute  Minutes = 9 / 2  Minutes = 4.5 minutes  So, the machine worked for 4.5 minutes today.
Response:  If industrial machine can make 3 t-shirts in one minute and yesterday it made 4 t-shirts, then today it made 8 t-shirts. So, the total number of t-shirts that the machine has produced is:  Yesterday - 4 + Today - 8 = 12 t-shirts.
Response:  If industrial machine can make 6 shirts in one minute and worked for 12 minutes yesterday, it made 72 shirts (6 x 12 = 72). Today, if it worked for 14 minutes, it made 98 shirts (6 x 14 = 84 + 14 = 98). So, in total, the machine has made 72 + 98 = 170 shirts.
Response:  If the machine can make 6 t-shirts in one minute and worked for 5 minutes today, then it made 30 t-shirts (6 x 5 = 30). And if it made 12 t-shirts yesterday, then the total number of t-shirts it made today is 42 (30 + 12 = 42).
Response:  If they earned the same amount of money every day, then we can write an equation as follows: Daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days $165 = x / 5 $x = 33 dollars per day
Response:  We know that Igri bacanja prstena (the finger game) earns $144 per day at Carnival. Since they were there for 22 days, we can calculate their total income as follows: Total income = Daily income x Number of days = $144/day x 22 days = $3,068 Igri bacanja prstena earned $3,068 during their time at Carnival.
Response:  We know that every day they earn the same amount of money from the carnival game. So if they earned $420 in 30 days, then they earned $14 per day ($420 / 30 = $14). Since they also won $22 playing the game together, their daily income from the ring toss game is $16 ($14 + $2). Therefore, the ring toss game earned $16 per day.
Response:  In the first 44 days, they earned $382. In the remaining 10 days, they earned $374. So in total, they earned $756 ($382 + $374).
Response:  We know that in the first 20 days of the carnival, Igri bacanka earned $120. To find out how much he earned per day during this period, we can divide the total amount he earned by the number of days he worked:  $120 / 20 = $6 per day  In the remaining 16 days of the carnival, Igri bacanka earned $66. To find out how much he earned per day during this period, we can again divide the total amount he earned by the number of days he worked:  $66 / 16 = $4 per day  Therefore, Igri bacanka earned $6 per day during the first 20 days and $4 per day during the remaining 16 days of the carnival.
Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of the carnival, $325 was earned and in the remaining 57 days, $114 was earned. So, we have total earnings = $325 + $114 = $439. To find out how much they earned per day during the remaining 57 days, we can divide the total earnings by the number of days left: $439 / 57 = $7.80 per day. Therefore, they earned $7.80 per day during the remaining 57 days of the carnival.
Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packages of cookies and 4 packages of cake, then she must have bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages of baked goods. So, Lucy still has 6 packages of baked goods left over after buying both the cookies and the cake.
Response:  Paketov kolaƒça = 4 x 22 = 88 Paketova torte = 22 x 1 = 22 Paketova ƒçokolade = 16 x 1 = 16 Total number of packages = 88 + 22 + 16 = 136
Response:  If Lucy bought 23 packages of cookies and some packages of cake, then she had a total of 23 + x packages of food, where x is the number of packages of cake she bought. Since we know that Lucy had a total of 27 packages of food, we can set up the equation: 23 + x = 27. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. So Lucy had 4 packages of cake.
Response:  If Lucy bought 2 packages of cookies and 12 packages of cake, then she has a total of 14 packages (2 + 12 = 14). Since each package contains 8 or 10 rests, Lucy has a total of 112 rests (14 x 8 = 112). So, the answer is 112.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got into the bus at the next stop. So, now we have 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry no more than 36 people, we know that the total number of people in both buses is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the number of people in the first bus is also less than or equal to 36 / 2 = 18 people.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 new passengers got on the bus and 3 of them got off. So, now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people entered the bus, so now there are 13 people inside. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got into the train, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train. Therefore, currently there are 19 people in the train.
Response:  If there were 22 parents in the program and a total of 676 people, then the number of children present would be equal to 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students present at the program.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents and 724 students in the program. Therefore, the total number of people present at the program is:  Parents + Students = 73 + 724 = 807 people.
Response:  If there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students, that means there are 395 people (174 + 521) present at the event. So, to find out how many more students than parents were present, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of people present: 395 - 174 = 221. Therefore, there were 221 more students than parents present at the event.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students. If we multiply these two numbers together, we get 1087 (61 x 177). However, this is not the correct answer because it assumes all of the parents and students were present at the same time, which may not have been the case. To find out how many people were actually present at the program, we need to divide the total number of parents and students by the number of people who could be present at any one time. In this case, if each parent brought one child, then there would be 2x = 2 x 177 = 354 people present at the program (61 parents x 1 child per parent + 177 students). Therefore, the answer is 354.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and we need to find out how far it is from the cave entrance to the end of the cave. To do this, we can use the formula distance = speed x time + initial position (in this case, the starting point is the cave entrance).  First, let's calculate the speed at which they are traveling. According to the text, they must cover 1307 feet in order to reach the end of the cave. If we divide the distance by the time taken to cover it, we get the speed:  Speed = Distance / Time = 1307 ft / 25 min = 52 ft/min  Now we have the speed at which they are traveling. Next, we can use the formula distance = speed x time + initial position to find out how far it is from the cave entrance to the end of the cave: Distance = 52 ft/min x 25 min + initial position = 52 ft/min x 25 min + 0 ft = 1307 ft + 0 ft = 1307 ft Therefore, the distance from the cave entrance to the end of the cave is 1307 feet.
Response:  They are currently at 849 feet and want to reach the end of the cave which is 1218 feet deep. So they have to climb 369 feet more. If they travel at a speed of 17 feet per minute, it will take them:  Time = Distance / Speed = 369 feet / 17 feet/minute = 21.5 minutes. Therefore, they still need 21.5 minutes to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We are currently at an altitude of 659 feet and we want to know how far we have left until reaching the end of the cave. To find out, we can use the following formula: Distance = Altitude - Starting Altitude. In this case, our starting altitude is 0 feet (the cave entrance), so: Distance = 659 - 0 = 659 feet. Therefore, there are 659 feet left before reaching the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 goldfish in the lake and then Macaksu (the cats) wanted to eat them. So, they ate 6 of them. Now we have to find out how many goldfish are left after this incident. To do so, we can use the following equation: Number of goldfish left = Initial number of goldfish - Number of goldfish eaten By using this equation, we get: Number of goldfish left = 8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 golden fish left in the lake after the cats ate 6 of them.
Response:  We know that Paige had 7 goldfish and 12 sunfish in the lake initially. If the crows wanted to eat them all up, then we can assume that they ate 7 + 12 = 19 fish. So, the number of fish left with Paige is 15 - 19 = -4. Therefore, there are -4 fish left with Paige.
Response:  According to the problem, Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 minnows in the lake. The crows wanted to eat them all up. So, Paige was left with only two goldfish. Therefore, we can conclude that 14 (16 - 2) goldfish were eaten by the crows.
Response:  If Paige was raising 15 golden fish in the lake and the crows wanted to eat them, then we know that 5 of them were eaten. So, if we subtract 5 from 15, we get 10 remaining golden fish. Therefore, there are 10 golden fish left in the lake.
Response:  If he had 43 jabukes and gave away 2, then he has 41 jabukes left. So, he used 2 jabukes.
Response:  Kuvar had 58 apples and used 35 of them to make a pie. So, how many apples are left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples he used from the total number of apples he had: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 apples left.
Response:  If Kuhar had 40 apples and 54 walnuts after he made a pit, then he must have started with 40 + 54 = 94 pieces of fruit in total. After he made the pit, he was left with 39 apples. Therefore, Kuhar used 94 - 39 = 55 apples to make the pit.
"Response:  If Adam can place 11 action figures on each of his four shelves, then he has a total of 11 x 4 = 44 action figures that he can place on all of his shelves combined. Since there are 4 shelves in his room and 40 drawers, we can calculate the maximum number of action figures that can fit in each drawer as follows: Number of action figures per drawer = Total number of action figures / Number of drawers So, the maximum number of action figures that can fit in each drawer is: 44 / 40 = 1.1 action figures per drawer Now, let's check if this calculation makes sense based on the information provided in the question: According to the question, Adam has 4 shelves with 4 action figures each, for a total of 16 action figures on those shelves. Additionally, he has 40 drawers, which means he can fit 1.1 action figures per drawer (based on our previous calculation). Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam can place in his room is: 16 + (1.1 x 40) = 62 action figures This answers the question ""How many action figures can Adam put on each shelf?"" as 4 action figures per shelf."
Response:  If Adam can place 10 action figures on each of his shelves and his room can hold 8 action figures in total, then we need to find out how many shelves he has in his room. So, if he can place 10 action figures per shelf, then he must have at least 8/10 = 0.8 or 80% of his shelves occupied with action figures. Therefore, there are approximately 80% of 10 = 8 shelves in his room.
"Response:  If Adam can place 8 action figures and 10 toy cars on each of his four shelves, then he can place:

8 x 4 = 32 action figures on all of his shelves combined.
10 x 4 = 40 toy cars on all of his shelves combined.

So in total, Adam can place 32 + 40 = 72 items on his shelves."
Response:  If there are 10 gardens and each garden has 544 pots, then the total number of pots is 10 x 544 = 5440.  Since each pot contains 32 flowers, the total number of flowers in all 10 gardens is 5440 x 32 = 176,800.
Response:  We know that each lonƒç has 53 cvijeƒáa and 181 ≈°tapiƒáa. So, if we multiply these numbers together, we get: 53 x 181 = 9,233. Therefore, there are 9,233 cvjeƒáe and 9,233 ≈°tapiƒáa in total.
Response:  We know that each lonƒç has 71 cvjet and 91 stap in it. So, if we have xloncs, then we will have x times 71 cvjet plus x times 91 stap = total number of flowers + total number of stalks. Therefore, the total number of flowers is equal to x times 71, and the total number of stalks is equal to x times 91. Now, we need to find out what value of x gives us the desired total number of flowers. Let's assume that the total number of flowers is 100. Then, we can set up the equation as follows: 100 = x times 71 + x times 91. Solving for x, we get x = 35. Therefore, there are 35 loncs with 71 flowers and 35 loncs with 91 stalks in total.
Response:  If each jar has 40 spoons, and there are total of 400 spoons, then we can calculate the number of jars as follows: Number of jars = Total number of spoons / Number of spoons per jar = 400 / 40 = 10 So, there are 10 jars in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in Steven's collection and 4276 gumballs. To find out how many groups of each size we have, we can divide the total number of items by 154 (the number of groups requested). So: Number of Skittles = 4502 / 154 = 29  Number of gumballs = 4276 / 154 = 28 Therefore, each group contains approximately 29 Skittles and 28 gumballs.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in the collection and 4950 gumballs. To find out how many groups of gumballs we can make with these numbers, we need to divide the number of gumballs by the number of Skittles. So, if we divide 4950 by 3941, we get: $ \frac{4950}{3941} = 12 $ Therefore, there are 12 groups of gumballs in the collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and Steven has 517 pieces of gum. So, we have:

Skittles = 896
Gum = 517
Vacancies = 90

Now, let's divide the number of Skittles among the groups:

Group size = Total number of Skittles / Number of groups
= 896 / n (where n is the number of groups)

Since Steven has 517 pieces of gum, he cannot eat all the Skittles. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of Skittles he can eat from each group:

Subtracted Skittles = Group size x Number of pieces of gum Steven can eat
= n x 517 (since Steven can eat up to 517 Skittles)

So, the remaining Skittles after Steven eats his share will be:

Remaining Skittles = Total number of Skittles - Subtracted Skittles
= 896 - (n x 517)

Finally, since there are 90 vacancies left, we can distribute them among the groups as follows:

Distributed Vacancies = Remaining Skittles / Number of groups
= (896 - (n x 517)) / n

Therefore, the size of each group is:

Group size = Distributed Vacancies / Number of groups
= (896 - (n x 517)) / n

Answer: The size of each group is approximately 104 Skittles."
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in this school.
Response:  If there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students, then we have: 304 x 75 = 22,100 students in total.
