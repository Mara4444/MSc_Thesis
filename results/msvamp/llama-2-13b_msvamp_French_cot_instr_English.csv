"Response:  We know that Julia played with 18 children on Monday and 10 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So...

18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 11 children. So, if we subtract 11 from any number, we will get a smaller number. For example, if we subtract 11 from 20, we get 9. Therefore, to find out how many more children Julia played with on Tuesday than she did on Monday, we need to subtract 11 from her total number of players on Tuesday. In this case, that would be 12 - 11 = 1. So, Julia played with one more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday (the first day). If she played with some more children on Tuesday (the second day), then the total number of children she played with is 5 + x, where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday. Since we are told that she played with a total of 15 children, we can set up an equation as follows:

5 + x = 15

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday."
"Response:  If Julia played with 16 children in total, and she played with some of them on Monday (since she didn't play with all 16 on that day), then the number of children she played with on Monday is less than 16. Since she played with 14 children on Tuesday, we can set up an equation to represent the information given in the problem:

Let x be the number of children Julia played with on Monday.

We know that x + 14 = 16 (since she played with 14 children on Tuesday)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2

So, Julia played with 2 children on Monday."
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children on Monday and 12 more on Tuesday, then she played with a total of 16 + 12 = 28 children on both days combined. So, on Tuesday alone, she played with 12 children.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Monday and 8 more than she did on Monday, then she played with 14 + 8 = 22 children on Monday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with x children on Monday (x = 17), y children on Tuesday (y = 15), and z children on Wednesday (z = 2). To find out how many children she played with in total, we can add all three numbers together: x + y + z =.... Can you fill in the blank?
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  
15 + 18 = 33 
So, Julia played with 33 children on Monday and Tuesday combined."
Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and 15 children on Wednesday. To find out how many children she played with on both days combined, we can add 5 + 15 = 20. So, Julia played with 20 children on Monday and Wednesday.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 2 children on Monday (the first day), so she has not played with any children yet on Tuesday (the second day). Therefore, on Tuesday, Julia played with 0 children. On Wednesday (the third day), Julia played with 16 children. So, in total, Julia played with 18 children (2 + 0 + 16 = 18) during these three days.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 9 children on Monday (M), 7 children on Tuesday (T), and 96 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, M - T =?

Let's substitute the numbers:

M = 9
T = 7

Now, let's calculate:

M - T = 9 - 7 = 2

So, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 14 children on Monday (Lundi), and she played with 8 children on Wednesday (Mercredi). To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So, let's do that:

14 - 8 =?

The difference is 6. Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than she did on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 8 children on Monday (Lundi), 11 children on Tuesday (Mardi) and 9 children on Wednesday (Mercredi). To find out how many more children she played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Wednesday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday. So, let's do that:

11 - 9 = 2

So, Julia played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 15 children on Monday (M), 18 children on Tuesday (T), and 7 children on Wednesday (W). To find out how many more children she played with on M and T compared to W, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on W from the number of children she played with on M and T.

So, let's do that:

15 (M) - 7 (W) = 8

18 (T) - 7 (W) = 11

Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday and 11 more children on Tuesday than she did on Wednesday."
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 children and on Tuesday, she played with 10 children. So far, we have:  
Monday: 13 + Tuesday: 10 = Total: 23 children. 
On Wednesday, she played with 15 children. Therefore, our final answer is:  
Total: 23 + 15 = 38 children."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 7 children and on Tuesday, she played with 13 children for a total of 7 + 13 = 20 children. So, Julia has played with 20 children in total.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 12 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday. To find out how many children she played with in total, we need to add 12 + 14 = 26 children.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 19 children on Monday and 18 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So let's do that:

19 - 18 =?

The difference is 1. Therefore, Julia played with one more child on Monday than on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 6 children on Monday and 5 children on Tuesday. To find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday. So...

6 - 5 =?

That gives us...

6 - 5 = 1

So, Julia played with one more child on Monday than she did on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday and some more on Tuesday. So, if we add 4 + x (where x is the number of children she played with on Tuesday), we get the total number of children she played with on both days.

x + 4 = 18

Solving for x, we get:

x = 14

So, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday."
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Wednesday and she played with 6 children on Monday. So, we can start by subtracting 4 from 6 to find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Wednesday:  
6 - 4 = 2 
So, Julia played with 2 more children on Monday than on Wednesday."
Response:  If Bobby had eaten some candy and then ate 25 more candies, we can start by finding out how many candies he ate in total. We know that he ate 25 more candies after eating some, so let's add 25 to the number of candies he ate at first. In total, Bobby ate 43 candies. Now, we need to find out how many candies he ate at first if he ate 25 more later on. To do this, we can subtract 25 from 43. So, Bobby ate 18 candies at first.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 28 candies and then he ate 42 more. So in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 candies.
Response:  First, Bobby ate 33 candies and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 candies. Now, let's talk about the chocolate. Bobby ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby ate is 37 (candies) + 14 (chocolate) = 51.
"Response:  First, we know that Bobby has eaten 38 + 36 = 74 bonbons in total. We also know that he has eaten 16 pieces of chocolate. To find out how many more bonbons than chocolate Bobby has eaten, we need to subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total number of bonbons he has eaten:  
74 - 16 = 58. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 58 more bonbons than chocolate."
Response:  First, Bobby ate 34 bonbons, so he has 20 - 34 = -14 left. Then, he ate 18 more, so now he has -14 + 18 = 4 left. Therefore, Bobby ate 4 bonbons in total.
Response:  First, Bobby had 21 bonbons and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 21 - 5 = 16 bonbons left. Then, he ate 9 more, so now he has 16 + 9 = 25 bonbons left. Therefore, Bobby has 25 bonbons left.
"Response:  We know that Bobby had 22 candies and he ate some of them. Then, he ate 5 more. So, if he has 8 candies left, we can subtract 5 from 22 to find out how many candies he ate at first.  
22 - 5 = 17
So, Bobby ate 17 candies at first."
Response:  If Bobby had 19 candies and he ate 2, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 candies left. So, Bobby has 17 candies left.
"Response:  If Bobby had 32 candies and he ate some of them, then he must have eaten less than all of them because he still has some left. So let's say he ate x candies. We know that after he ate the candies, he had 20 candies left. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

32 - x = 20

Now solve for x.

32 - x = 20
x = 12

So Bobby ate 12 candies."
Response:  If Bobby had 36 bonbons and he ate 17 of them, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 bonbons left. Then, if he ate 15 more, he would have 19 + 15 = 34 bonbons left. So, Bobby has 34 bonbons left.
Response:  If Bobby had 30 candies and he ate 23 of them, then he has 30 - 23 = 7 candies left.
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons. To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake, we need to subtract the number of balloons Jake brought from the number of balloons Allan brought. So...

5 (Allan) - 3 (Jake) = 2

Therefore, Allan had 2 more balloons than Jake at the park."
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 3 balloons. So we can start by comparing these numbers. 
Jake had 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Allan at the park."
Response:  If Allan brought 2 balloons, then Jake must have brought 3 - 2 = 1 balloon to the park. So Jake brought one balloon to the park.
"Response:  We know that Jake brought 6 balloons to the park and that he brought 4 more than Allan. So if we let A be the number of balloons Allan brought, then Jake brought A + 4 = 6. Substituting this into our equation, we get:
A + 4 = 6
Solving for A, we get:
A = 2
So Allan brought 2 balloons to the park."
Response:  If Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and Jake brought 6 more than that, then Jake brought 6 + 5 = 11 balloons to the park.
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 3 balloons and Jake brought 5 balloons to the park. So together they have 3 + 5 = 8 balloons at the park. Then, Allan bought 2 more balloons at the park, so now he has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons. Therefore, in total, there are 5 + 5 = 10 balloons at the park.
"Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. So, if we compare their total number of balloons, we get:

Allan - 2 + 3 = 5 balloons
Jake - 4 = 4 balloons

Now, we can see that Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake at the park."
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. So, initially, Jake had 6 - 2 = 4 more balloons than Allan at the park. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons, so now he has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. Therefore, Jake still has 4 more balloons than Allan after Allan purchased additional balloons.
Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 5 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more at the park. So, in total, Allan brought 5 + 3 = 8 balloons to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 2 balloons to the park. So, initially, Allan had 6 - 2 = 4 more balloons than Jake. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park, so now Jake has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons in total. Therefore, Allan still has 4 more balloons than Jake after Jake purchased additional balloons.
"Response:  First, we know that Allan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 balloons. So, if we compare their total number of balloons, we get:

Allan has 6 + 0 = 6 balloons at the park
Jake has 3 + 0 = 3 balloons at the park

Now, let's consider what happened next - Jake bought 4 more balloons at the park. So, his new total is:

Jake has 3 + 4 = 7 balloons at the park

Therefore, Jake had 7 - 6 = 1 more balloon than Allan at the park."
Response:  First, we know that Jake brought 6 ballons to the park and then he bought 3 more balloons at the park. So, in total, Jake brought 6 + 3 = 9 ballons to the park.
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 3 balloons and 20 balls to the park. So, if we add up all of these numbers, we get:  
3 + 20 = 23 
Now, let's look at what Jake brought. He brought 5 balloons and 59 balls. If we add up all of these numbers, we get:  
5 + 59 = 64 
So, in total, there were 23 + 64 = 87 objects (ballons and balls) at the park."
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park, so we can start by adding these numbers together to find out how many objects Allan brought in total:  
7 + 5 = 12 
Now let's do the same for Jake. We know that Jake brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park, so we can add these numbers together to find out how many objects Jake brought in total:  
6 + 4 = 10 
So, Allan brought 12 objects to the park (7 balloons and 5 balls), and Jake brought 10 objects to the park (6 balloons and 4 balls)."
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 balloons and together they have 6 balloons. So, Jake must have brought (6 - 5) = 1 balloon to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more there, so in total, Allan had 2 + 3 = 5 balloons at the park. If Jake had 6 balloons at the park, then Jake had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on English compared to Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent on Chinese from the time spent on English.  
So, if Ryan spends 6 hours per day on English and 2 hours per day on Chinese, then he spends:  
6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours more on English than on Chinese."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends on Chinese than on English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on English from the number of hours he spends on Chinese. So let's do that:  
7 hours - 6 hours = 1 hour 
So, Ryan spends one additional hour per day on Chinese compared to English."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and some additional time learning Chinese. If he spends a total of 4 hours per day learning both languages, then the amount of time he spends learning Chinese is equal to the difference between his total study time and the time he spends studying English. In other words, we can set up an equation as follows:  
Time spent learning Chinese = Total study time - Time spent studying English 
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  
Time spent learning Chinese = 4 hours - 3 hours 
Simplifying, we have:  
Time spent learning Chinese = 1 hour 
Therefore, Ryan spends one hour per day learning Chinese."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours learning English and some additional time learning Chinese. If he spends 2 more hours learning English than Chinese, then he must spend 2 + 7 = 9 hours learning English. Therefore, he spends 7 - 9 = 8 hours learning Chinese.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours learning Chinese and some more time learning English. If he spends 2 hours more learning English than Chinese, then he must spend 2 + 5 = 7 hours learning English.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. So if he learns for 5 days, he will spend a total of 6 x 5 = 30 hours learning English and 7 x 5 = 35 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, the total number of hours Ryan spends learning both languages is 30 + 35 = 65 hours.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. So if he learns for 2 days, how many hours will he spend in total?  
Day 1: 6 hours (English) + 5 hours (Chinese) = 11 hours  
Day 2: 6 hours (English) + 5 hours (Chinese) = 11 hours  
Total time spent learning both languages over 2 days: 11 hours x 2 days = 22 hours"
"Response:  If he spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one week (7 days), he will spend:

* 5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours learning English
* 4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours learning Chinese

Therefore, in total, Ryan will spend 35 + 28 = 63 hours learning languages during the week."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese. So if he learns for 86 days, we can calculate how many hours he will spend in total learning each language.  
For English: 4 hours/day x 86 days = 344 hours  
For Chinese: 6 hours/day x 86 days = 510 hours  
Therefore, Ryan will spend 344 hours learning English and 510 hours learning Chinese if he learns for 86 days."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, so he learns English for 6 x 5 = 30 hours per week. He also spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese, which is equal to 7 x 5 = 35 hours per week. Finally, he spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish, which is equal to 3 x 5 = 15 hours per week. In total, Ryan spends 30 + 35 + 15 = 80 hours per week learning languages.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many extra hours he spends on English compared to Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent on Chinese from the time spent on English.  
6 hours/day - 3 hours/day = 3 hours/day more on English than Chinese. 
Since there are 7 days in a week, multiplying this difference by 7 gives us the total number of extra hours spent on English per week:  
3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week more on English than Chinese. 
Therefore, Ryan spends 21 hours more per week on English than on Chinese."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours learning English and 4 hours learning Spanish each day. To find out how many extra hours he spends on English compared to Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on Spanish from the total number of hours he spends on all three languages.  
Total hours per day = 7 (English) + 2 (Chinese) + 4 (Spanish) = 13 hours  
Subtracting the number of hours spent on Spanish from the total number of hours gives us:  
13 - 4 = 9  
Therefore, Ryan spends 9 more hours studying English than Spanish each day."
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends on Chinese than on Spanish, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on Spanish from the number of hours he spends on Chinese. So...

5 hours/day - 4 hours/day = 1 hour/day

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more per day on Chinese than on Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, that means he has 1 hour left to learn Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. So if we multiply these numbers together, we get:  
4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours of English instruction  
5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours of Chinese instruction Total number of hours spent learning both languages: 28 + 35 = 63 hours"
"Response:  We know that Tiffany had 8 sacs of canettes on Monday and found 7 more sacs on Tuesday. So, if we subtract the number of sacs she had on Monday from the total number of sacs she found on Tuesday, we get:  
8 (Monday) - 7 (Tuesday) = 1 More sac on Tuesday than she had on Monday."
"Response:  On Monday, she had 7 sacs of canettes. The next day (Tuesday), she found 12 more bags of canettes. So, if we subtract the number of bags she had on Monday from the total number of bags she found on Tuesday, we get:  
12 - 7 = 5  
Therefore, Tiffany found 5 more bags of canettes on Tuesday than she had on Monday."
"Response:  We know that Tiffany had 4 sacs of canettes on Monday and she found some additional sacs the next day. So if we let X be the number of additional sacs she found, then we can write an equation to represent the situation as follows:

4 + X = 6 (since she had a total of 6 sacs)

Now solve for X by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

X = 6 - 4

X = 2

So Tiffany found 2 additional sacs of canettes the next day."
Response:  If she had 4 extra bags of cans the next day, that means she already had some bags of cans on Monday (the previous day). So if she found 4 more bags of cans, that would mean she had a total of 8 bags of cans on Monday. Therefore, Tiffany had 8 bags of cans on Monday.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 10 sacs of canettes on Monday (the first day). On Tuesday, she found 3 more sacs, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 sacs. On Wednesday, she found 7 more sacs, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 sacs. Therefore, Tiffany had a total of 20 sacs of canettes.
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 sacs of canettes. The next day (Tuesday), she found 10 more sacs, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 sacs. Then, on Wednesday, she found 4 more sacs, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 sacs. Therefore, after Monday, she found a total of 22 - 8 = 14 sacs of canettes.
Response:  We know that Tiffany had 3 sacs of canettes on Monday and found 7 more on Tuesday. So she has 3 + 7 = 10 sacs of canettes in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 red peaches and 16 green peaches in total. To find out how many more red peaches than green peaches, we need to subtract the number of green peaches from the number of red peaches. So, if we subtract 16 (the number of green peaches) from 17 (the number of red peaches), we get...

Question: What is the difference between the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches?

Answer: The difference between the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches is 17 - 16 = 1. There is one more red peach than green peach in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red peaches and 11 green peaches in total. To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of green peaches. So, if we subtract 5 (the number of red peaches) from 11 (the number of green peaches), we get:  
11 - 5 = 6 
Therefore, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 red peaches and some green peaches in the basket. If we add up all the peaches, we get:  
10 + x = 15 (where x is the number of green peaches) 
Solving for x gives us: 
x = 5 
So, there are 5 green peaches in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 red peaches and some green peaches in the basket. If there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches, we can start by finding out how many red peaches there are.  
There are 3 red peaches, so let's write down ""3"" as our first number. Now, we need to find out how many green peaches there are if there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. To do this, we subtract 3 from 10 (since there are 3 red peaches), which gives us:  
10 - 3 = 7 So, there are 7 more green peaches than red peaches. Since there are 3 red peaches, we add 7 to 3 to get the total number of green peaches: 3 + 7 = 10 There are 10 green peaches in the basket!"
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red peaches, 15 yellow peaches, and 8 green peaches in total. So we can add them up to get the grand total of peaches in the basket. Here is the calculation:
7 + 15 + 8 = 30
Therefore, there are 30 peaches in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red peaches, 71 yellow peaches and 8 green peaches in total. To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches. So, if we subtract 7 (the number of red peaches) from 79 (the total number of peaches), we get:  
79 - 7 = 72. Therefore, there are 72 peaches in the basket, which is equal to 72 - 7 = 65 more green peaches than red peaches."
Response:  We know that there are 2 red peaches, so we can subtract 2 from the total number of peaches to get the number of yellow and green peaches. There are 6 yellow peaches and 14 green peaches, for a total of 20 peaches minus 2 = 18 peaches. Since there are more green peaches than yellow peaches in the basket, there must be at least one more green peach than yellow peach. So the difference between the number of green peaches and yellow peaches is at least 1. Therefore, there are at least 1 more green peach than yellow peach in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 red peaches and 11 yellow peaches in total. To find out how many more red peaches than yellow peaches, we need to subtract the number of yellow peaches from the number of red peaches. So, if we do this, we get:  
19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more red peaches than yellow peaches in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 red peaches and 16 green peaches in total. So if we add these two numbers together, we get 22. Therefore, there are 22 peaches of either red or green color in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red peaches and 14 yellow peaches in total. So we can start by adding these numbers together to get our grand total of peaches:  
18 + 14 = 32 
Now let's find out how many red and yellow peaches there are altogether. To do this, we can add the number of red peaches to the number of yellow peaches:  
18 + 14 = 32 
So there are 32 peaches altogether - both red and yellow!"
Response:  We know there are 14 yellow peaches and 6 green peaches in total. So if we add these numbers together, we get 20. Therefore, there are 20 peaches in the basket, with 14 of them being yellow and 6 of them being green.
Response:  We know that each basket has 7 red peaches and 3 green peaches. So if we multiply 65 baskets by 7 red peaches per basket, we get 455 red peaches (7 x 65 = 455). And if we multiply 65 baskets by 3 green peaches per basket, we get 195 green peaches (3 x 65 = 195). In total, there are 455 + 195 = 650 peaches in all the baskets.
Response:  We know that each basket has 10 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So if we multiply the number of baskets (11) by the total number of peaches in each basket (28), we get a grand total of 318 peaches.
"Response:  We know that each basket has 16 red peaches and 18 green peaches. So if we multiply the number of baskets (6) by the number of red peaches in each basket (16), we get:

6 x 16 = 96

There are 96 red peaches in total."
Response:  We know that each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. So if we multiply the number of baskets (7) by the number of green peaches in each basket (2), we get a total of 14 green peaches.
"Response:  We know that each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches for a total of 7 peaches per basket. Since we want to find out how many baskets there are in total, let's call this variable ""b"". So, if we have b baskets, we will have 4b red peaches + 3b green peaches = 7b peaches in total. Now, we need to solve for b using our equation. Can you do it?"
"Response:  We know that each basket has 4 red peaches and some green peaches. Since there are 2 baskets in total, we can add up how many peaches they have altogether:  
Total number of peaches = Number of red peaches x 2 + Number of green peaches  
= 4 x 2 + (some number)  
= 8 + (some number) Now we know that there are 12 peaches in all, so let's see if we can find out what the ""some number"" is:  
Total number of peaches = 12 So, we can set up an equation:  
8 + (some number) = 12 Solve for the ""some number"":  
(some number) = 12 - 8  
(some number) = 4 Therefore, there are 4 green peaches in each basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 pêches in total and 13 of them are red. So, we can start by subtracting 13 from 16 to find out how many pêches are left.  
16 - 13 = 3 
Now, we know that there are 3 pêches left, but we don't know if they are red or green. To solve this problem, we need to divide the number of pêches left by 2 because each pêche is either red or green.  
3 / 2 = 1 + 1 
So, there are 2 pêches left, one red and one green. Therefore, there are 1 green peach in the basket."
"Response:  We know that each basket contains 19 red peaches and 4 green peaches. So if we have x baskets, we will have:

19x + 4x =... (where x is the number of baskets)
23x =...

Now, we are told that there are 15 baskets in total. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation:

23(15) =...

Solving for the unknown variable 'x', we get:

23(15) = 23 x 15 = 345

So, there are 345 peaches in total within the 15 baskets."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 peaches in total and each basket contains 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. So we can start by finding out how many baskets of peaches we have based on this information. To do this, let's use division!

10 (total number of peaches) ÷ 4 (number of red peaches per basket) =? (number of baskets)

Do you want to try solving for the answer?"
"Response:  We know that there are 6 pêches vertes and 2 pêches rouges in the basket. To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of green peaches. So, if we do this:  
6 (green) - 2 (red) = 4 
Therefore, there are 4 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket."
Response:  If Jerry had 4 figurines of action on his shelf initially and later added some more, then the number of figurines he had initially is equal to 4. So, if there are now a total of 8 figurines on the shelf, Jerry has added 8 - 4 = 4 figurines to the shelf.
"Response:  If Jerry had 7 more figurines of action on his shelf after he added them to the existing ones, then he must have had x figurines initially (where x is any number). 
We know that the sum of all the figurines on the shelf now is 10 (since there are 10 in total), so we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 7 = 10
Solving for x, we get:
x = 3
Therefore, Jerry had 3 figurines of action on his shelf initially before adding 7 more."
"Response:  If Jerry had 4 action figures to start with and then added 6 more, how many action figures are there in total?  
To find out, we can add 4 + 6 = 10. So, there were 10 action figures on Jerry's shelf in total."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 5 + 7 = 12 action figures on the shelf. Now, let's compare this number with the number of books: 9. Since there are more action figures than books on the shelf (12 vs 9), we can say that there were 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf after he added the new ones.
Response:  If Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books initially, then he added 4 more action figures later. So, in total, there were 2 + 4 = 6 action figures. Now, let's compare this to the number of books: 10 - 6 = 4 books. Therefore, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  If Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books initially, then he had a total of 8 + 9 = 17 items on his shelf. Later, when he added 10 more books, there would be a total of 17 + 10 = 27 items on his shelf. So, there were 27 books on Jerry's shelf in total.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf, that means he had a total of 7 + 2 = 9 items on his shelf to start with. Later, when he added 4 more books, he now has a total of 9 + 4 = 13 items on his shelf. So there are 13 - 9 = 4 more books than action figures on his shelf.
Response:  If Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf, that means he had a total of 5 + 2 = 7 items on his shelf to start with. Later, he added 9 more books, so now there are 7 + 9 = 16 items in total on his shelf. Therefore, there were 16 - 7 = 9 more books than action figures on his shelf.
Response:  If Jerry had 8 figurines to start with and added 4 more, then he has a total of 8 + 4 = 12 figurines on his shelf. But we are also told that he removed 5 old ones, so if we subtract 5 from 12, we get 12 - 5 = 7 figurines left on the shelf. Therefore, there were 7 figurines on Jerry's shelf in the end.
Response:  If Jerry had 3 figurines of action on his shelf initially and then added 4 more, he would have a total of 7 figurines of action on the shelf now (3 + 4 = 7). So, if there are currently 6 figurines of action on the shelf, Jerry must have removed 1 figurine from the shelf (6 - 3 = 1).
Response:  We know that Jerry had 7 figurines of action on his shelf initially and later added some more. If he has 8 figurines now, then he must have added one more figurine to the existing 7. So, Jerry added 1 figurine to the shelf.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had some action figures on an shelf in his room and later added two more action figures to the shelf. He also removed seven of the old ones. So if he has ten action figures now, we can calculate how many he had initially.
Let x be the number of action figures Jerry had initially.
We know that he added two new ones, so the total number of action figures now is:
x + 2
We also know that he removed seven, so the total number of action figures now minus the number he had initially is:
x + 2 - x = 2
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2 = x + 2 - x
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
So Jerry had four action figures initially on the shelf."
"Response:  We know that Jerry had 9 action figures and added 7 more to make a total of 16 action figures. If he also has 10 books, we can compare how many action figures there are compared to how many books there are. To do this, we need to divide the number of action figures by the number of books. So let's divide 16 (the number of action figures) by 10 (the number of books):  
16 ÷ 10 = 16 / 10 = 1 + 6 = 7 
So, there were 7 action figures more than books on Jerry's shelf."
Response:  We know that Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on his shelf initially. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there were 3 + 4 = 7 items on the shelf. Now, we need to find out how many action figures were added compared to the number of books. To do this, we can subtract the number of books from the total number of items on the shelf:  7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, there were 4 action figures more than books on Jerry's shelf after he added the two new ones.
Response:  If Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on his shelf, that means he had 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. Later, when he added two more action figures, he now has 10 + 2 = 12 items on his shelf. So there are 12 - 7 = 5 more action figures than books on his shelf.
"Response:  We know that there were initially two birds sitting on the fence. If other birds have come to join them, then the total number of birds on the fence is 2 + x, where x is the number of additional birds that came to join. Since we are told that there are now six birds on the fence in total, we can set up the equation:

2 + x = 6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So, four birds have come to join the initial two birds on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there were initially x birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have x + 4 birds on the fence now. The problem states that there are currently 5 birds on the fence, so we can set up an equation:
x + 4 = 5
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1
So, there was one bird sitting on the fence at first."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 4 oiseaux and 46 cigognes sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:

4 + 6 = 10

birds sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 3 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:

3 + 5 = 8 birds

And how many storks? Well, we started with 2 storks, so there are still 2 storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, the final answer is:

8 birds and 2 storks (or 10 animals in total) sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence. If two more birds come to join them, then there will be 3 + 2 = 5 birds in total. Since we were told that there are more birds than storks, we can conclude that there must be at least one bird more than the number of storks, which is 1. So, the final answer is 5 - 4 = 1 bird more than the number of storks.
Response:  We know that there are 2 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence. If 3 more birds come to join them, then there will be 2 + 3 = 5 birds in total. Now, we need to find out how many storks are left on the fence. Since there were originally 6 storks, and 3 more birds came to join them, then there must be 6 - 3 = 3 storks left on the fence. So, the final answer is 5 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are already 4 birds (oiseaux) and 6 cigognes sitting on the fence. If 2 more cigognes come to join them, then in total we have:

4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.

So, there are 10 cigognes sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks came to join them. So, in total, we have:

3 (birds) + 4 (storks) + 6 (more storks) = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

Therefore, there are 13 birds and storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that there are 6 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. If two more storks come to join them, then we have a total of 6 + 3 = 9 birds (including both storks and other birds) sitting on the fence. So, there are 9 - 6 = 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 birds and 3 storks sitting on the fence. If we add 6 more storks to this group, how many storks will be sitting on the fence in total? 
We can start by counting the number of storks: 3 + 6 = 9. So, there will be 9 storks sitting on the fence. Now, let's count the number of birds: 4. Therefore, there will be 4 birds sitting on the fence. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 9 - 4 = 5. So, there will be 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 6 birds sitting on the fence and then 4 more birds came to join them. So, in total, we have:

6 + 4 = 10 birds sitting on the fence.

Now, we are also told that 8 storks (cigognes) came to join the birds on the fence. Therefore, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is:

10 + 8 = 18 animals sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that there are 2 birds already sitting on the fence and 5 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 2 + 5 = 7 birds sitting on the fence. Now, we also know that 4 storks (cigognes) came to join the birds. Therefore, the number of birds minus the number of storks is equal to the number of storks. In this case, it would be:  
7 - 4 = 3  
So, there are 3 more birds than storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence initially and 2 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence. Now, if 6 crows come to join them, then the total number of birds (including both oiseaux and crows) sitting on the fence is 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 - 3 = 8 more crows than birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 5 cigognes and 3 oiseaux initially sitting on the fence. If 4 more birds come to join them, then we have a total of 5 + 3 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 8 - 5 = 3 more birds sitting on the fence than cigognes.
Response:  We know that there are 6 cigognes and 2 oiseaux initially sitting on the fence. If 3 more birds come to join them, then we have a total of 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many of these birds are cigognes. There are 6 cigognes among the initial 6 + 3 = 9 birds, so there are 6 - 2 = 4 cigognes more than oiseaux. Therefore, there are 4 cigognes more than oiseaux sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence initially and then 6 crows join them. So, in total, we have 3 + 6 = 9 birds sitting on the fence now. Now, if we add 2 more birds to this group, we will get a total of 9 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 11 - 3 = 8 more crows than birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So let's do that:

48 - 11 = 37

So the first chapter is 37 pages longer than the second chapter!"
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 37 pages and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter. So let's do that:

80 - 37 = 43

So the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter!"
"Response:  We know that there are 93 pages in the book and the first chapter has 60 pages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages in the second chapter as follows:  
93 - 60 = 33 pages. 
So, there are 33 pages in the second chapter."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 pages in the book and the second chapter has 36 pages. So we can start by subtracting the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages to find out how many pages are left for the first chapter.  
67 - 36 = 31  
Therefore, the first chapter must have 31 pages."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages and the third chapter has 24 pages. To find out how many pages the book has in total, we need to add up all these numbers. So, if we do this, we get:

66 + 35 + 24 = 125

So, the book has 125 pages in total."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 91 pages and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, if we do this, we get:

91 - 23 = 68

So, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter."
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 35 pages and the third chapter has 3 pages. So we can start by subtracting 3 from 35 to find out how many more pages are in the first chapter than in the third chapter:

35 - 3 = 32

Now let's look at the second chapter. It has 18 pages. How many more pages does it have compared to the third chapter?

18 - 3 = 15

So the second chapter is 15 pages longer than the third chapter!"
"Response:  We know that the first chapter has 53 pages and the third chapter has 21 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the third chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So let's do that:

53 - 21 = 32

So the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter!"
"Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. So we can start by multiplying the number of chapters by the number of pages per chapter to find out how many pages the book has in total.  
31 chapters x 61 pages/chapter =............................... (fill in the blank)
Now let's fill in the blank with the correct calculation.  
31 chapters x 61 pages/chapter = 1861 pages
Therefore, the book has 1861 pages in total."
Response:  We know that there are 23 pages in total and the first chapter has 10 pages. So we can say that the remaining number of pages is 23 - 10 = 13 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 10 pages.
"Response:  We know that there are 81 pages in total and the second chapter has 68 pages. So we can calculate how many pages are left for the first chapter as follows:  
Total pages = 81 pages  
Pages of the second chapter = 68 pages  
Therefore, number of pages in the first chapter = Total pages - Number of pages in the second chapter  
= 81 pages - 68 pages  
= 13 pages  
So, there are 13 pages in the first chapter."
"Response:  We know that in total, 62 campeurs have gone kayaking (morning + afternoon). 
We also know that 39 campeurs went kayaking in the morning and 23 Campeurs went kayaking in the afternoon. So we need to find out how many more people went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, subtract the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon from the number of people who went kayaking in the morning. 
So, if we subtract 23 from 39, we get: 
39 - 23 = 16 
Therefore, there are 16 more people who went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that 52 campeurs went in the morning and 61 campeurs went in the afternoon. To find out how many more people went in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of people who went in the morning from the number of people who went in the afternoon. So let's do that:

61 - 52 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 more people who went in the afternoon compared to the morning."
"Response:  We know that 15 campeurs went canoeing in the morning and some other campers went canoeing in the afternoon. If a total of 32 campers went canoeing that day, then we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Morning + Afternoon = Total  
15 + x = 32  
Where ""x"" is the number of campers who went canoeing in the afternoon.  
Now let's solve for ""x"". To do so, we need to isolate the variable ""x"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:  
Morning + Afternoon = Total  
15 + x = 32  
Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:  
Afternoon = Total - Morning  
Afternoon = 32 - 15  
Afternoon = 17  
So there were 17 campers who went canoeing in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that 7 campeurs have gone kayaking in the afternoon and we want to find out how many campers went kayaking in the morning. So let's subtract 7 from 60 (the total number of campers who went kayaking):

60 - 7 = 53

So there were 53 campers who went kayaking in the morning."
"Response:  We know that in the morning, 36 campeurs went canoeing, so we write down this information as follows:

Morning: 36

In the afternoon, 13 campeurs went canoeing, so we add this to our previous number:

Afternoon: 36 + 13 = 49

Finally, in the evening, 49 campeurs went canoeing, so we add this to our previous number:

Evening: 49 + 49 = 98

Therefore, a total of 98 campeurs went canoeing."
"Response:  We know that in total, 44 campeurs have gone kayaking (morning + afternoon + evening). 
We also know that 39 campeurs went kayaking in the morning and afternoon combined. So we can subtract 39 from 44 to find out how many more people went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon: 
44 - 39 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more people who went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that in total, there were 53 + 48 + 49 = 150 campers who went kayaking. To find out how many more campers went kayaking in the morning than at night, we need to subtract the number of campers who went kayaking at night from the total number of campers who went kayaking. So, if we subtract 49 (the number of campers who went kayaking at night) from 150 (the total number of campers who went kayaking), we get:

150 - 49 = 101

So, there are 101 campers who went kayaking in the morning compared to 49 campers who went kayaking at night, which means that 52 more campers went kayaking in the morning than at night."
"Response:  We know that 34 campeurs went canoeing in the afternoon and 10 went canoeing at night. To find out how many more people went canoeing in the afternoon than at night, we need to subtract the number of people who went canoeing at night from the number of people who went canoeing in the afternoon. So let's do that:

34 - 10 = 24

So, 24 more people went canoeing in the afternoon than at night."
"Response:  We know that 13 campeurs went kayaking in the morning and 21 went kayaking in the afternoon, so together they are:

13 + 21 = 34 campeurs have gone kayaking."
"Response:  We know that 29 campeurs have gone kayaking in the morning and 26 have gone kayaking in the afternoon. So we need to find out how many more people went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon. To do this, we subtract the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon from the number of people who went kayaking in the morning. 
Let's start with the total number of campers who went kayaking: 29 + 26 = 55. Now let's subtract the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon from the number of people who went kayaking in the morning: 55 - 26 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 more campers who went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that 41 campeurs have gone canoeing in the morning and 26 have gone canoeing in the afternoon. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:

41 + 26 = 67

So, in total, 67 campeurs have gone canoeing. Now, let's look at the number of campers who have done both canoeing and hiking. We know that 4 campeurs have done both activities in the morning, so we need to subtract this number from the total number of campers who have gone canoeing:

67 - 4 = 63

Therefore, 63 campeurs have done both canoeing and hiking."
"Response:  We know that in total, 46 campers went canoeing. Of those, 43 went in the morning and some others went in the afternoon. To find out how many went in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went in the morning from 46. So, if 43 campers went in the morning, then:  
46 - 43 = 3  
Therefore, 3 campers went canoeing in the afternoon."
Response:  If Rachel picked 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples on the tree, then there must be 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  If the tree had initially 4 apples and now there are 2 left, then Rachel must have picked 2 apples. So, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and there are still 5 left. If 3 of them are ripe, then there must be 2 immature ones left on the tree. So, the number of immature apples is 2.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from the tree and there are now 7 apples left on the tree. If 6 of them are ripe, then there were 7 - 2 = 5 immature apples on the tree initially. So, the number of ripe apples the tree had at first is 5 + 2 = 7.
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 6 apples from the tree and there are now 2 ripe apples left on the tree. So, if we subtract the number of ripe apples (2) from the total number of apples Rachel picked (6), we get:  
6 - 2 = 4 
Therefore, the tree had 4 unripe apples at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree and there are now 2 ripe apples left on the tree. So, if we subtract 3 (the number of apples Rachel picked) from 2 (the number of ripe apples left), we get:  

2 - 3 =?  

Solution: 2 - 3 = 0. Therefore, the tree had 0 ripe apples at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree and then two more grew back. So if we subtract the number of apples she picked (7) from the total number of apples after new ones grew (9), we get: 
9 - 7 = 2 
Therefore, there were 2 apples on the tree at first."
Response:  First, Rachel had 2 apples on her tree. Then she picked 4 more apples from the tree. So now there are 2 + 4 = 6 apples on the tree. But wait! Three new apples have grown on the tree since then. So now there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree.
"Response:  We know that Rachel picked 2 apples from one of her trees and now there are 7 apples left on the tree. So we can start with the equation:

Let X be the number of apples the tree had at first (before Rachel picked any).

We know that Rachel picked 2 apples, so the number of apples the tree has now is:

X - 2 = 7

Now we need to solve for X. To do this, we can add 2 to both sides of the equation:

X = 7 + 2

X = 9

So the tree had 9 apples at first!"
Response:  We know that each tree had 8 apples initially and Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree. So, in total, she picked 24 apples (8 x 3). Now, we are told that there are still 9 apples left on each tree. Therefore, the total number of apples at the start was 24 + 9 = 33 apples.
"Response:  We know that each tree has 7 apples left after Rachel picked 7 from each tree. So, if we multiply the number of trees (4) by the number of apples left in each tree (7), we get:  
4 x 7 = 28 
So, Rachel picked a total of 28 apples."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 2 more balls than Doug initially. So if Ed has 19 more balls now, then Doug must have lost some balls. To find out how many balls Doug lost, let's subtract the number of balls Ed had from the total number of balls Ed and Doug have combined. 
Ed has 19 more balls than Doug, so we can write an equation based on this information:  
Let E be the number of balls Ed has = 19 + D (where D is the number of balls Doug has) 
Since both players started with the same number of balls, we know that E = D + 2...(1) 
Now, we are given that Ed has 19 more balls than Doug, so we can substitute equation (1) into the second equation to get: 
D + 2 = E + 19 
Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get: 
D + 2 = E + 19 
Subtracting E from both sides gives us: 
D = 17 
Therefore, Doug has lost 17 balls."
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more billes than Doug at first. If Doug lost 11 billes, then he has only 11 - 10 = 1 fewer bille than Ed now. So, Ed has 45 billes and Doug has 44 billes. The difference between them is 45 - 44 = 1. Therefore, Ed had one more bille than Doug after Doug lost 11 billes.
Response:  If Ed had 22 billes and Doug lost 7 of his billes, then Doug has 22 - 7 = 15 billes now.
"Response:  We know that Ed had 27 billes and Doug lost 3 of his billes at the playground. So, if we subtract 3 from Ed's number of billes, we can find out how many billes Doug had initially.  

Ed had 27 billes - 3 = 24 billes

Therefore, Doug had 24 billes initially."
"Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more balls than Doug to start with. So if we let E be the number of balls Ed had and D be the number of balls Doug had, then:
E = D + 24... (1)
We also know that Doug lost 27 balls, so his new total is:
D - 27... (2)
Now we need to find out how many balls Ed had after finding the extra 9 balls. Let's call the number of extra balls F:
E = D + 24 + F... (3)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:
E = (D - 27) + 24 + F
Simplifying, we have:
E = D + 5 + F
Now we can substitute equation (1) into this equation:
E = (D + 24) + 5 + F
Combine like terms:
E = 2D + 29 + F
Since Ed had 24 more balls than Doug, we know that:
F = 9
So substituting this value into the previous equation, we get:
E = 2D + 29 + 9
Solve for E:
E = 2(20) + 29 + 9
= 40 + 29 + 9
= 78
Therefore, Ed had 78 balls in total, which is 24 more than Doug had."
Response:  If Ed had 29 more balls than Doug and lost 17 balls, then he must have had 29 + 17 = 46 balls in total. So, at that point, Ed had 46 - 30 = 16 more balls than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug at first. If Ed has 8 more marbles now, then he must have lost 11 marbles (19 - 8 = 11).
Response:  If Ed had 91 billes and lost 21 of them, then he has 91 - 21 = 70 billes left. Since Doug started with 60 billes, we can say that Ed had 70 - 60 = 10 more billes than Doug at that point in time.
Response:  If Ed had 17 billes and lost 20, then he has 17 - 20 = 3 billes left. Since Ed started with 12 more billes than Doug, Doug started with 12 + 3 = 15 billes. Therefore, Doug now has 15 billes.
"Response:  We know that there are in total 408 + 42 = 450 students who have suggested something to add to the menu. Of those, 408 students have suggested adding mashed potatoes (purée de pommes de terre) and 42 students have suggested adding bacon. To find out how many more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than suggesting adding bacon, we can subtract the number of students who suggested adding bacon from the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes:  
408 - 42 = 366. So, 366 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than suggesting adding bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are in total 479 + 489 = 968 students who have suggested either adding mashed potatoes or bacon to the menu. Now we need to find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. To do this, we can subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the total number of students:  
968 - 479 = 489 
So, 489 students suggested bacon, which is 119 more than the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes (479)."
"Response:  We know that there were 310 students in total who suggested food items. Of those, 185 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu, and some (but not all) of the remaining students suggested adding bacon. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

310 - 185 = x + y 
where x is the number of students who suggested bacon and y is the number of students who suggested other items. Solving for x, we get: 

x = 125 
So, 125 students suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  We know that 288 students made suggestions and 264 suggested adding bacon to the menu. That means 288 - 264 = 24 students did not suggest adding bacon. Of those who did not suggest adding bacon, how many suggested adding mashed potatoes? Since there are 24 students in this group, we can say that 24 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu.
"Response:  We know that in total, 457 students suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon for the school lunch menu. If 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.
Let M be the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and B be the number of students who suggested bacon.
We know that M + B = 457 (total number of students)
Since 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon, we can write:
M - B = 63
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use these equations to find out how many students suggested bacon?"
"Response:  We know that there were in total 182 suggestions for the school lunch menu. Of those, x students suggested adding bacon and y students suggested adding mashed potatoes. Since more students suggested adding bacon than mashed potatoes, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + y = 182... (1)

We also know that x is greater than y, so we can write:

x > y... (2)

Now we are given that 166 students more suggested adding bacon than mashed potatoes. This means that:

x - y = 166... (3)

Can you use these equations to find out how many students suggested adding bacon?"
"Response:  We know that in total, there were 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students who suggested new dishes. So, to calculate how many students participated in suggesting each of these dishes, we need to divide the number of students who suggested each dish by the total number of students.

For the potato puree, we have 324 / 826 = 0.395 or approximately 40% of the students suggested adding this dish.

For the bacon, we have 374 / 826 = 0.455 or approximately 45% of the students suggested adding this dish.

For the tomatoes, we have 128 / 826 = 0.154 or approximately 15% of the students suggested adding this dish.

So, in summary, approximately 40% of the students suggested adding potato puree, 45% suggested adding bacon, and 15% suggested adding tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are in total 257 students who have suggested food items. Of those, 120 suggested adding bacon to the menu and 97 suggested adding tomatoes. That means there are 38 (257 - 120 - 97) students who have suggested other items or no item at all. Now, we need to find out how many of these 38 students have suggested mashed potatoes specifically. Since 257 is the total number of students, each student has an equal chance of suggesting any of the three options (mashed potatoes, bacon, or tomatoes). So, if x students have suggested mashed potatoes, then the probability of a randomly selected student suggesting mashed potatoes is x/257. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, we can set up the following equation using this probability:

x/257 = (38/257) + (120/257) + (97/257)

Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

x = 38(257/38) + 120(257/120) + 97(257/97)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 46

So, there are 46 students who have suggested mashed potatoes, which is 16 more than the number of students who suggested bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are in total 144 + 467 + 79 = 680 students who have suggested different food items. Now we need to find out how many more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes. To do this, we subtract the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes from the total number of students and then divide the result by the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes. So let's calculate:  
680 - 79 = 601 (total minus the number of students who suggested adding tomatoes)  
601 / 79 = 7 (difference between the two numbers) 
Therefore, 7 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are 23 students who suggested adding tomatoes and 337 students who suggested adding bacon. To find out how many more students suggested bacon than those who suggested tomatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon. So, if we subtract 23 from 337, we get:

337 - 23 = 314

Therefore, 314 students suggested bacon more than those who suggested tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there were 66 options in total and 450 students participated. That means each student chose an average of approximately 66/450 = 1.46 options. Since some students may have chosen fewer or more options than this average, let's round up to 2 options per student.
Now we know that 38 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, so if we subtract this number from the total number of participants (450), we get:
450 - 38 = 412
Therefore, 412 students suggested new dishes for the school cafeteria menu."
"Response:  We know that in total, 218 + 351 = 569 students have suggested some type of food to add to the menu. Of those, 218 students have suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon, so we can subtract that number from the total to find out how many students suggested only bacon:

569 - 218 = 351

Therefore, 351 students have suggested adding only bacon to the menu."
"Response:  We know that 330 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 269 students suggested adding bacon. To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes. So, if we subtract 269 from 330, we get:

330 - 269 = 61

Therefore, there were 61 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in total. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we need to subtract the number of boys from the number of girls. So, let's do that:  
569 - 236 =... 
What is the result?"
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in the school and we want to find out how many more boys there are than girls. To do this, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So let's start with the total number of students: 34 + 841 = 875. Now, if we subtract 34 from 875, we get: 875 - 34 = 841. Therefore, there are 841 boys in the school, which is 817 more than the number of girls (34).
"Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So we can start by subtracting the number of girls from the total to find out how many boys there are:  
485 - 232 =... 
Now let's simplify our calculation:  
485 - 232 = 253 
So there are 253 boys in this school!"
"Response:  We know that there are 697 girls in total and 228 more girls than boys. So if we subtract 228 from 697, we get the number of boys.  
697 - 228 =... 
What is the result?"
"Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in total and 510 more boys than girls. So if we subtract 510 from 635, we get the number of boys in the school.  
635 - 510 =... 
Can you solve for the number of boys?"
"Response:  We know that there are x boys in the school and 281 more girls than boys. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 281 = 868

Now, let's solve for x. To do so, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can subtract 281 from both sides of the equation:

x + 281 - 281 = 868 - 281

This simplifies to:

x = 607

Therefore, there are 607 boys in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 700 girls in total and 142 more boys than girls. So if we subtract 142 from 700, we get the number of boys. How many students are there in total? To find out, we add the number of boys to the number of girls. Therefore, the total number of students is:  
700 + 568 = 1268. "
"Response:  We know that there are initially 706 girls and 222 boys in the school, for a total of 928 students (706 + 222). If 418 additional girls join the school, we need to add this number to the original total. So, the new total is:  
928 + 418 = 1346 students."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 902 girls in the school and we want to find out how many girls there will be after 44 more girls join the school. To do this, we can use addition. So let's add 44 to 902:  
902 + 44 = 946 
Therefore, there will be 946 girls in the school after 44 more girls join."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. So, if we add the number of new girls (465) to the initial number of girls, we get:  
632 + 465 = 1097  
Now, let's compare this total with the number of boys in the school:  
1097 - 410 = 687  
So, there are 687 girls in the school compared to 410 boys, which means there are 277 more girls than boys in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. If 682 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be:  
732 + 682 = 1414 girls. 
Now, we need to find out how many boys joined the school. Since there were already 761 boys, if 8 more boys join the school, then the total number of boys will be:  
761 + 8 = 769 boys. 
So, in total, there will be 1414 girls and 769 boys in the school after all students have joined."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 135 girls and 214 boys in the school. If 496 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be:  
135 + 496 = 631  
Now, if we add the same number of boys as girls (i.e., 496) to the original number of boys, we get:  
214 + 496 = 710  
Therefore, there are now 710 boys in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in total. So if we add them together, we get:  
308 + 318 = 626 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school, so together they make up 624 students (315 + 309). Additionally, we know that there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the total number of people in the school is 624 + 772 = 1396.
"Response:  We know that there are 402 more girls than boys in the school. If we let G represent the number of boys and F represent the number of girls, we can write an equation based on this information:
G + F = 739... (1)
We also know that there are 402 more girls than boys, so we can express this as:
F = G + 402... (2)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (G and F). Can you use these equations to find out how many boys are in the school?"
"Response:  We know that there are 458 more girls than boys in the school. If we let X be the number of boys and Y be the number of girls, then we can write an equation based on this information:
X + Y = 692 (since there are 692 students in total)
We also know that Y is 458 more than X, so we can rewrite the equation as:
X + Y = 692
Y = X + 458
Now we need to find out how many boys there are. To do this, we can substitute Y with its expression in terms of X:
X + (X + 458) = 692
2X + 458 = 692
Subtracting 458 from both sides gives us:
2X = 133
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
X = 66
So there are 66 boys in the school. Now we can find out how many girls there are by using our first equation:
Y = X + 458
Y = 66 + 458
Y = 524
Therefore, there are 524 girls in the school. In total, there are 66 boys and 524 girls, for a total of 590 students in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. If we add 403 more girls to this number, how many girls will be enrolled altogether?  
Firstly, let's calculate the total number of students in the school after adding the new girls:  
Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls  
= 362 + 403  
= 765  
Now, we can see that there are 765 students in the school altogether. Of these, 362 are boys, and 403 are girls. So, the difference between the number of boys and girls is:  
Number of girls - Number of boys = 403 - 362  
= 41  
Therefore, there are 41 more girls than boys in the school."
Response:  If Edward had $18 and spent $16, then he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. So, Edward has $2 now.
"Response:  We know that Edward had $13 and now he has $3 left. So we can start by subtracting what he spent from what he had:
$13 - $3 = $10
Edward spent $10."
Response:  We know that Edward spent $9 + $8 = $17 dollars in total. So he had $17 - $17 = $0 before spending his money.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 to buy 92 books, so each book cost him $\$16/92 = \$0.17$. Now we are told that he has $\$6$ left, so let's subtract what he spent from what he had before: $\$6 - \$16 = -\$10$. So Edward had $\-$10 before spending his money.
"Response:  We know that Edward spent 6 dollars and now he has 12 dollars. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  

6 + x = 12 

Where ""x"" is the cost of each book. To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:  

6 + x - 6 = 12 - 6 

This simplifies to:  

x = 6 

So each book costs 6 dollars."
"Response:  We know that Edward spent 6 dollars for books and 16 dollars for pens. So he has 19 dollars left. To find out how much money he had before spending his money, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he has now.  
$19 - $6 = $13
So Edward had $13 before spending his money."
"Response:  We know that Edward has $12 dollars in total and he spent $4 dollars for books and $3 dollars for pens. So we can write an equation to represent this information:  
$12 = $4 + $3 
Now let's solve for the variable ""x"" (which represents the cost of books): 
$12 - $3 = $4 
$9 = $4 
So x = $9 or $4 
Therefore, Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens."
"Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after spending all of his money. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract what he spent on pens from what he had left.  
$19 - $8 = $11 
So Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens."
"Response:  We know that Edward spent $17 and then received $10 from his friend. So, he has $7 left. To find out how much he had before spending money, we need to subtract what he spent ($17) from what he has now ($7): 
$7 - $17 =? 
Do you have an idea?"
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary. So we can write an equation to represent this information:

Zachary = 44... (1)
David = Zachary + 58... (2)

Now we need to solve for the total number of push-ups done by both Zachary and David. To do this, we can add equations (1) and (2):

Total = Zachary + David
= 44 + (Zachary + 58)
= 44 + 58Zachary
= 58Zachary + 44

So the total number of push-ups done by Zachary and David is 58Zachary + 44 = 58(44) + 44 = 2664 + 44 = 2708."
"Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 push-ups and David has done 44. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did. So, if we subtract 44 (the number of push-ups David did) from 51 (the number of push-ups Zachary did), we get:  
51 - 44 = 7 
So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David."
"Response:  We know that David has made 44 push-ups in total and he did 9 more than Zachary. So we can set up an equation as follows:

David's number = Zachary's number + 9

We are looking for Zachary's number, so we can solve for it:

Zachary's number = David's number - 9

Substituting David's number with 44:

Zachary's number = 44 - 9

Zachary's number = 35

Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups today."
"Response:  We know that David did 51 push-ups in the gym today and that he did 49 more than Zachary. So if we subtract 49 from 51, we get... 
51 - 49 = 2! 
So Zachary did 2 push-ups today. Therefore, David did 51 - 2 = 49 push-ups today, and together they did 49 + 2 = 51 push-ups."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 pompes and 44 abdominaux in total today at the gym. If David did 19 more pompes than Zachary, then David did 59 + 19 = 78 pompes. But we also know that David did 27 fewer abdominaux than Zachary, so David did 44 - 27 = 17 abdominaux. Therefore, David did a total of 78 pompes and 17 abdominaux today at the gym.
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 pompes and 17 abdominaux in total. If David did 29 more pompes than Zachary, then David did 44 + 29 = 73 pompes. Since David did fewer abdominaux than Zachary, we can say that David did x abdominaux, where x is less than 17 (the number of abdominaux Zachary did). So our equation becomes:  

73 - x = 13 

Solving for x gives us: 

x = 56 

Therefore, David did 56 abdominaux."
"Response:  We know that David has done 17 more push-ups than Zachary but 10 fewer crunches. So if we let X be the number of push-ups Zachary did and Y be the number of crunches he did, we can write an equation based on what we know:
X + Y = 53 (since Zachary did 53 in total)
David did X + 17 more push-ups, so David did X + 17
Since David did 10 fewer crunches than Zachary, David did Y - 10
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you use substitution or elimination to solve for X and Y?"
"Response:  We know that David has done 58 more push-ups than Zachary and 87 fewer crunches than Zachary. So if we subtract the number of push-ups David did from the total number of push-ups Zachary did, we can find out how many more push-ups Zachary did.  
Zachary did 35 push-ups + (58 - 87) = 35 + (-87) = 35 - 87 = -52  
Therefore, Zachary did 52 fewer push-ups than David."
"Response:  We know that David has done fewer abdominals than Zachary but more push-ups. So we can start by subtracting the number of push-ups David did from the total number of push-ups Zachary did to find out how many push-ups Zachary did more than David:  
Zachary did 46 push-ups - David did 38 push-ups = 8 more push-ups for Zachary. 
Now let's look at the difference in abdominal exercises between the two:  
Zachary did 58 abdominals - David did 62 abdominals = -4 less abdominals for David. 
Since David did fewer abdominals than Zachary, we need to add the number of abdominals David did to the difference in push-ups to get the total difference between the two:  
8 (push-up difference) + (-4) = 4  
Therefore, Zachary did 4 more abdominal exercises than David."
"Response:  We know that David has done 39 more than Zachary, so we can write an equation:
David = Zachary + 39
We also know that John did 13 fewer than David, so we can write another equation:
John = David - 13
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Zachary and David). Can you use these equations to find out how many push-ups David did?"
"Response:  We know that David made 22 more pompes than Zachary, so if Zac made 51 pompes, then David made :

51 + 22 = 73 pompes

We also know that John made 4 less pompes than David, so John made :

73 - 4 = 69 pompes

Therefore, John made 69 pompes today at the gym."
"Response:  We know that David has done 39 more than Zachary, so we can set up an equation as follows:

David - Zachary = 39

We also know that John has done 9 less than David, so we can set up another equation:

David - John = 9

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (Zachary and John). Can you use these equations to find out how many more pompes Zachary did than John?"
Response:  We know that David has done 30 more than Zachary. So if David did 37, then Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7. Therefore, Zachary did 7 push-ups today in the gym.
"Response:  We know that David did 38 pompes and Zachary did 56 pompes less than David. So if we subtract 56 from 38, we get:  
38 - 56 = 12 
So Zachary did 12 pompes today at the gym. Therefore, together they did 38 + 12 = 50 pompes."
"Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches. So if Zachary did x push-ups and y crunches, David did x + 40 push-ups and y - 17 crunches. Now we are given that Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. Substituting these values into our equation above gives us:
x + (34 + 40) = y - 17
x + 74 = y - 17
x = 59
So David did 59 push-ups and y - 17 crunches, where y is the number of crunches Zachary did."
"Response:  We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary but 33 fewer crunches. So if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Zachary's Push-Ups = David's Push-Ups + 36
Zachary's Crunches = David's Crunches - 33

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (David's push-ups and crunches). Solving for David's push-ups in the first equation, we get:

David's Push-Ups = Zachary's Push-Ups + 36
= 58 + 36
= 94

And solving for David's crunches in the second equation, we get:

David's Crunches = Zachary's Crunches - 33
= 33 - 33
= 0

So David did 94 push-ups and 0 crunches. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than crunches, we subtract the number of crunches from the number of push-ups:

Difference = 94 - 33
= 61

Therefore, Zachary did 61 more push-ups than crunches."
"Response:  We know that David has done 27 more push-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer crunches. So if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches, we can start by finding out how many push-ups Zachary did.  
Zachary did 5 push-ups, so David did 5 + 27 = 32 push-ups. Now let's find out how many crunches David did.  
David did 32 push-ups, so he also did 32 x 7 = 224 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 17 crunches more than push-ups, while David did 224 crunches more than push-ups."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of mathematics homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. To find out how many more pages of mathematics homework she has than reading comprehension homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension homework from the number of pages of mathematics homework. So, if we subtract 2 pages (reading comprehension) from 5 pages (mathematics), we get:  
5 - 2 = 3 
Therefore, Rachel has 3 more pages of mathematics homework than reading comprehension homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. To find out how many more pages she has for reading than for math, we can subtract the number of pages for math from the total number of pages for reading. So, if we subtract 3 (pages of math) from 4 (pages of reading), we get:  
4 - 3 = 1 
Therefore, Rachel has 1 page more of reading homework than math homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of mathematics homework and more than 5 pages of reading comprehension homework. So if she has to complete a total of 7 pages of homework, then she must complete at least 2 pages of reading comprehension homework.  
Therefore, the answer is 2 pages."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 7 pages of mathematics homework and she needs to do 4 more pages than her reading homework. So if we let X be the number of pages of reading homework, then Rachel will have to do 7 + X = 11 pages in total. Since she only has to do 4 more pages than her reading homework, we can set up the equation:  
X + 4 = 11  
Solving for X, we get:  
X = 7  
So Rachel needs to complete 7 pages of reading homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and she needs to do 3 more pages than her reading homework. So if she completes x pages for reading, then she will have to complete (8 + x) pages in total. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x + (8 + x) = 12 + 3(x + 8) 
Simplifying the equation further:  
2x + 8 + 3x = 12 + 24 
Combine like terms:  
5x + 8 = 36 
Subtract 8 from both sides:  
5x = 28 
Divide both sides by 5:  
x = 5 
So Rachel needs to complete 5 pages of reading homework. Therefore, she must complete a total of 8 + 5 = 13 pages of homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and she also needs to do 6 more pages of reading than mathematics. So if we let X be the number of pages of reading homework, then we can set up the equation as follows:  
X + 6 = 8 + X  
Simplifying the equation, we get:  
2X + 6 = 14  
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:  
2X = 8  
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  
X = 4  
So Rachel needs to complete 4 pages of reading homework in addition to her 8 pages of mathematics homework."
Response:  If she has to complete 3 more pages of reading than mathematics, that means she needs to complete 3 + 10 = 13 pages in total.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 2 pages of mathematics homework, 3 pages of reading comprehension, and 10 additional pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages she needs to complete in total, we can add up all these numbers:  
2 + 3 + 10 = 15 pages. 
Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 15 pages of homework in total."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 9 pages of mathematics homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. To find out how many more pages of mathematics she has than reading, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading from the total number of pages of mathematics. So, if we subtract 2 from 9, we get:  
9 - 2 = 7 
Therefore, Rachel has 7 more pages of mathematics homework than reading comprehension homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 11 pages of mathematics homework and 3 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages she has in mathematics than in biology, we can subtract the number of pages in biology from the total number of pages in mathematics. So, if we do this, we get:  
11 - 3 = 8 pages. 
Therefore, Rachel has 8 more pages of mathematics homework than biology homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had 11 pages of reading homework and 8 pages of biology homework. To find out how many more pages of reading homework she had than biology homework, we can subtract the number of pages of biology homework from the number of pages of reading homework. So, if we subtract 8 from 11, we get:  
11 - 8 = 3 
So, Rachel had 3 more pages of reading homework than biology homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete in total 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework. Now we are given that she has to complete 29 pages of biology homework. So, if we subtract the number of pages of biology from the total number of pages of homework, we get:  
20 - 29 = -9 pages of math and reading homework. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 9 fewer pages of math and reading homework than what is stated in the problem."
Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and 3 pages of biology homework. To find out how many pages she needs to do in each subject, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of subjects. So, for mathematics, we have:  8 pages / 1 subject = 8 pages per subject. For biology, we have:  3 pages / 1 subject = 3 pages per subject. Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 8 pages of mathematics homework and 3 pages of biology homework.
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to complete 5 pages of mathematics homework and 10 pages of reading comprehension homework. So far, we have:  
Mathematics = 5 pages Reading comprehension = 10 pages Total = 15 pages Now, we are told that she also needs to complete 6 pages of biology homework. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework Rachel needs to complete is: Total = 15 + 6 = 21 pages. Answer: Rachel needs to complete 21 pages of homework in total."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework and 4 pages of mathematics homework. To find out how many more pages of mathematics homework she had than reading homework, we can subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the total number of pages of mathematics homework. So, if we let X be the number of pages of reading homework, then we can write an equation as follows:  
X + 4 = 2 + X 
Simplifying this equation, we get:  
3X = 6 
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:  
X = 2 
So, Rachel had 2 more pages of mathematics homework than reading homework."
"Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of mathematics homework. To find out how many more pages she had in mathematics than in reading, we need to subtract the number of pages in reading from the number of pages in mathematics. So let's do that:  
7 - 4 = 3 
Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of mathematics homework than she did of reading homework."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received. So, if we subtract 2 from 8 (the total number of emails), we get:  
8 - 2 = 6 
Therefore, Jack received 6 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the number of emails he received in the afternoon. So let's do that:  
8 - 6 = 2 
Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So if he received 5 emails in total during the day, we can say that he received x emails in the morning (since we know he received 4) and y emails in the afternoon (where y is the number of additional emails he received). Now let's set up an equation to represent this information:

4 + y = 5

Now solve for y:

y = 5 - 4

y = 1

So Jack received 1 email in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening. To find out how many emails he received in total for the day, we need to add up all these numbers. So, if we add 6 + 3 + 5 = 14, then Jack received 14 emails in one day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many emails he received overall, we can add these two numbers together. So, Jack received 5 + 8 = 13 emails in total.
Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the afternoon and 8 emails in the evening. To find out how many emails he received overall, we can add these two numbers together. So, Jack received 5 + 8 = 13 emails in total.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening. So we can start by adding these two numbers together to find out how many emails Jack received in total.  
3 + 8 = 11
So Jack received 11 emails in total. Now let's divide this number by 2 to find out how many emails he received in each session (morning or evening).
11 / 2 = 5.5
Since we cannot have half an email, we will round up to the nearest whole number. This means Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, if we subtract 7 from 10, we get:  
10 - 7 = 3 
So, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the morning. So, let's do that:

9 (morning) - 7 (evening) = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the evening."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails in the afternoon and 4 emails in the evening. To find out how many more emails he received in the afternoon than in the evening, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the evening from the number of emails he received in the afternoon. So, if we subtract 4 from 5, we get:

5 - 4 = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 more email in the afternoon than in the evening."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening. So, if he received 10 emails in total during the day, we can deduce that he received 3 emails in the afternoon (since 6 + 3 = 10).
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 3 + 5 = 8 emails throughout the day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so we can start by adding these numbers together to get our total for the morning:  
5 (emails) + 6 (letters) = 11 
Now, we know that Jack received 9 more emails and 7 more letters in the afternoon. So, if we add these numbers to our previous total, we get:  
11 (morning) + 9 (afternoon emails) + 7 (afternoon letters) = 27 
Therefore, Jack received 27 messages in total throughout the day - 11 emails and 16 letters."
Response:  We know that Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon for a total of 10 + 3 = 13 emails. So, he did not receive any additional emails in the morning compared to the afternoon. The correct answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning, so we can start by adding these numbers together to get our total for the morning:  
6 + 8 = 14 
Now, we know that Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon, so we can add these numbers together as well:  
2 + 7 = 9 
To find out how many more letters Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the total number of letters he received in the morning:  
14 - 9 = 5 
So, Jack received 5 more letters in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails throughout the day.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and sent 2 emails. Then he received 6 more emails and sent 8 more emails in the afternoon. So, if we add up all the emails Jack received and sent, we get:  
4 (morning) + 6 (afternoon) = 10 emails  
And how many emails did Jack send?  
2 (morning) + 8 (afternoon) = 10 emails  
So, Jack sent out 10 emails in total throughout the day."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So if we subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the total number of emails he received during the day, we can find out how many emails he received in the afternoon.

Total number of emails = 9
Number of emails received in the morning = 7

Subtracting 7 from 9 gives us:

9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning. To find out how many more emails he received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning. So let's do that:

5 (morning) - 3 (afternoon) = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
"Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get:  
3 + 6 = 9 
Therefore, Jack received 9 emails in the morning and afternoon combined."
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 9 inches and the grenouille (frog) jumped 12 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the frog jumped. So...

12 - 9 = 3

So, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper."
Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 31 inches and the grenouille (frog) jumped 35 inches. To find out how far they jumped in total, we need to add their jumps together. So, if we add 31 + 35, we get...?
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 36 inches. The frog jumped 17 inches more than the sauterelle, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
Frog's jump = Sauterelle's jump + 17
We also know that the souris (mouse) jumped 15 inches more than the frog, so we can add another equation to our system of equations:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + 15
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the frog's jump and the mouse's jump). Can you use these equations to find out how far each animal jumped?"
Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 25 inches. The grenouille (frog) jumped 18 inches more than the sauterelle, so it jumped 25 + 18 = 43 inches. Finally, the souris (mouse) jumped 2 inches more than the grenouille, so it jumped 43 + 2 = 45 inches. Therefore, the souris jumped 45 inches.
Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches more than the grasshopper, so it jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches. Finally, the mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog, so it jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 inches in total.
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches more than the sauterelle, so we can calculate how far the frog jumped as follows:
Frog's jump = Sauterelle's jump + Increase in jump
= 19 inches + 39 inches
= 58 inches
Now, we know that the souris (mouse) jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so we can calculate how far the mouse jumped as follows:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - Decrease in jump
= 58 inches - 94 inches
= -36 inches
Since the mouse did not actually jump anywhere, we can say that its ""jump"" is zero. Therefore, the grenouille (frog) jumped 58 inches."
Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 25 inches. The frog jumped 32 inches more than the sauterelle, so it jumped 25 + 32 = 57 inches. And the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the frog, so it jumped 57 - 26 = 31 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches.
Response:  We know that the souris has sautéed of 5 pouces less than the grenouille. So if we subtract 5 from 38 (the distance sauted by the grenouille), we get 33 - 5 = 28. Therefore, the souris has sautéed 28 pouces more than the sauterelle.
"Response:  We know that the cricket jumped 13 inches and the frog jumped 2 inches more than the cricket. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Cricket's jump = 13 inches
Frog's jump = Cricket's jump + 2 inches

Now we need to find out how far the frog jumped. To do this, we can substitute the value of the cricket's jump into the equation for the frog's jump:

Frog's jump = 13 inches + 2 inches
= 15 inches

So the frog jumped 15 inches."
"Response:  We know that the grasshopper (la sauterelle) has jumped 35 inches and the frog (la grenouille) has jumped x inches. Since the grasshopper has jumped 4 inches more than the frog, we can write an equation based on this information:

Grasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + 4 inches

We also know that the sum of their jumps is equal to the total distance they have sautéed:

Total distance = Grasshopper's jump + Frog's jump

Now we can substitute the equation for the grasshopper's jump into the equation for the total distance:

Total distance = (Frog's jump + 4 inches) + Frog's jump

Simplify the equation:

Total distance = 2Frog's jump + 4 inches

Since we are looking for the total distance sautéed by both the grasshopper and the frog, we can solve for the total distance by adding the two expressions:

Total distance = 2Frog's jump + 4 inches

Now we need to find out how far the frog has jumped. Let's say the frog has jumped x inches. Then we can substitute this value into the first equation:

Grasshopper's jump = Frog's jump + 4 inches

Substitute x for Frog's jump:

Grasshopper's jump = x + 4 inches

Solve for the grasshopper's jump:

Grasshopper's jump = x + 4 inches

Now we have found the total distance sautéed by both the grasshopper and the frog:

Total distance = 2x + 8 inches

So the total distance sautéed by the grasshopper and the frog is 2 times the distance sautéed by the frog plus 8 inches."
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 19 inches (pouces). The frog has jumped 4 inches more than the toad and the mouse has jumped 44 inches less than the frog. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let X be the distance the frog has jumped (inches)

We know that the sauterelle has jumped 19 inches, so:

X + 4 = 19... (1)

We also know that the mouse has jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so:

X - 44 =... (2)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for X?"
Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 39 inches. The frog jumped 19 inches more than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches. The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 58 - 12 = 46 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 46 inches.
Response:  We know that the sauterelle has jumped 21 inches and that the grenouille has jumped 25 inches more than the sauterelle. So if we add 25 to 21, we get 46 inches. Now we are told that the souris has jumped 16 inches less than the grenouille, so if we subtract 16 from 46, we get 30 inches. Therefore, the sauterelle has jumped 30 inches more than the souris.
"Response:  We know that the sauterelle (grasshopper) jumped 17 inches and the grenouille (frog) jumped 39 inches. To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the frog jumped. So...

39 - 17 = 22

So, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper."
Response:  We know that the grenouille has jumped 33 inches more than the sauterelle. So if the sauterelle jumps 9 inches, then the grenouille jumps 9 + 33 = 42 inches. Now we are told that the souris jumps 3 inches less than the grenouille, so the souris jumps 42 - 3 = 39 inches. Therefore, the souris has jumped 39 inches.
"Response:  We know that the grenouille has jumped 37 inches more than the sauterelle. So if we subtract the distance of the sauterelle from the distance of the grenouille, we get:  
37 - 14 = 23  
So the grenouille has jumped 23 inches farther than the sauterelle. Now we need to find out how far the souris has jumped compared to the sauterelle. We are told that the souris has jumped 16 inches less than the grenouille. So if we subtract the distance of the grenouille from the distance of the souris, we get:  
23 - (-16) = 39  
So the souris has jumped 39 inches farther than the sauterelle."
Response:  We know that Mary has already used 5 tasses of farine and she needs to use 14 - 5 = 9 more tasses of farine. Since there are 6 tasses of sucre, we can say that for every 9 tasses of farine, she should add 6/9 = 2 tasses of sucre. Therefore, Mary must add 9 x 2 = 18 tasses of sucre.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already used 4 tasses of farine and she needs to use 9 tasses in total. So we can subtract what she has already used from the total amount needed:  
9 - 4 = 5 
Now let's look at the sugar. She needs 11 tasses of sugar but she hasn't used any yet. To find out how much more sugar she needs than flour, we can subtract the number of tasses of flour she has already used (4) from the total amount of sugar she needs (11):  
11 - 4 = 7 
So Mary needs 7 tasses more of sugar than flour."
"Response:  We know that Mary needs 8 tasses of farine more than sugar. If she has already added some farine, then she must have added at least 8 tasses of farine so far (since she still needs 8 tasses more). Therefore, we can subtract 8 from the total amount of farine needed (6 tasses) to find out how much farine Mary should add next:  
6 tasses - 8 = 2 tasses  
So, Mary should add 2 tasses of farine to her mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already mixed some flour and sugar together. If she needs 2 cups of flour more than sugar, then she must have used at least 2 cups of sugar already. So, if she has used 2 cups of sugar, then she still needs to mix 5 cups of flour (since there are 7 cups of sugar in total). Therefore, Mary has mixed 2 + 5 = 7 cups of flour so far.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 tasses of farine and she needs to add 6 more. So in total, she will have used 3 + 6 = 9 tasses of farine. The recipe demanded 9 tasses of farine.
Response:  We know that Mary needs 12 - 2 = 10 tasses of flour to make the cake. She has already put some flour, so she must have put at least 2 tasses of flour. Therefore, Mary has already mixed 2 tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 3 tasses of farine and 62 tasses of sucre. So she needs to add 9 - 3 = 6 more tasses of farine. And we also know that she has already added 62 tasses of sucre, so she doesn't need to add any more sugar. Therefore, Mary must still add 6 tasses of farine to complete her cake recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tasses of flour and 2 tasses of sugar. So she needs to add 5 - 10 = 5 tasses of flour and 14 - 2 = 12 tasses of sugar. Therefore, Mary must still add 5 tasses of flour and 12 tasses of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tasses of farine and she needs to add 12 - 11 = 1 more tasse of farine. So, she must add 1 tasse of farine.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already used 7 tasses of flour and she needs to use 3 more tasses of flour (10 - 7 = 3). So, she needs to add 3 tasses of flour.  
Now let's look at the amount of sugar. The recipe calls for 2 tasses of sugar, so we need to add 2 tasses of sugar. Therefore, the total amount of ingredients Mary needs to add is 3 tasses of flour + 2 tasses of sugar."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tasses of farine and she needs to add 12 - 2 = 10 more tasses of farine. She also needs to add 7 tasses of salt, so she will need to add 10 + 7 = 17 more tasses in total.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tasses of farine and she needs to add 6 - 5 = 1 more tasse of farine. Since there are 8 tasses of sugar in total, we can say that Mary needs to add (8 - 1) = 7 more tasses of sugar. Finally, since there are 7 tasses of salt in total, we can say that Mary needs to add (7 - 0) = 7 more tasses of salt. So, Mary should add 7 more tasses of sugar and 7 more tasses of salt to her mixture.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 13 - 2 = 11 tasses of sugar. So she must still add 11 tasses of sugar to make the cake.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tasses of sugar and she needs to add an equal amount of flour. So if she adds 4 tasses of sugar, then she should also add 4 tasses of flour. Therefore, she needs to add 4 tasses of flour more than she has already added. In total, she will need 9 - 4 = 5 tasses of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tasses of farine and she needs to add 9 - 2 = 7 more tasses of farine. So, she should add 7 tasses of farine in addition to the 6 tasses of sucre called for in the recipe.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 tasses of farine and she needs to add 5 tasses more for each tasse of farine. So if we multiply 11 (the number of tasses of farine she has already added) by 5 (the number of tasses of sugar she needs to add per tasse of farine), we get:  
11 x 5 = 55  
So Mary needs to add 55 tasses of sugar to her mixture."
"Response:  We know that Mary has already mixed some flour and needs 5 cups more of flour than sugar. So if she has x cups of flour now, she will need 5 + x cups of flour in total. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour, we can set up an equation:

3cups (sucre) + (5+x) cups (farine) = 10 cups (farine)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 7

So Mary has mixed 7 cups of flour so far."
Response:  We know that Mary needs 13 tasses of flour in total and she has already put some flour. If she still needs 12 tasses of flour, then she must have already put 1 tasse of flour (since 12 - 1 = 11). So, Mary has already mixed 1 tasse of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 tasses of farine and she needs to add 14 - 7 = 7 more tasses of farine. So, she should add 7 more tasses of farine.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tasses of farine and 10 tasses of sucre. So she still needs to add more sucre. The recipe calls for 11 tasses of sucre in total, so we can subtract what she has already added from the total amount needed:  
11 - (10 + 12) = 11 - 22 = -11 tasses of sucre. 
Mary must add -11 tasses of sucre to her mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 6 tasses of farine and she needs to add 10 more. So, she must still add 4 tasses of farine (10 - 6 = 4).
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tasses of farine and she needs to add more to make the total amount equal to the recipe's requirement (14 tasses). So we can start by subtracting what she has already added from the required amount:  
14 - 4 = 10 
Now we need to find out how much sugar she should add. The recipe requires 9 tasses of sugar, but since she has already added 4 tasses of farine, she will have to add less sugar accordingly:  
9 - 4 = 5 
Therefore, Mary should add 5 tasses of sugar and 10 tasses of flour to complete her cake."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tasses of farine and she needs to add 7 - 2 = 5 more tasses of farine. And we also know that she needs to add 4 tasses of salt. So, in total, she needs to add 5 + 4 = 9 tasses of ingredients. Therefore, Mary should add 9 - 2 = 7 tasses of farine and 4 tasses of salt.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tasses of farine and she needs to add 11 tasses of sugar and 9 tasses of salt. So we can start by subtracting what she has already added from the total amount needed for each ingredient:  
For sugar: 11 - 0 = 11 tasses more  
For flour: 12 - 12 = 0 tasses (she has already added enough)  
For salt: 9 - 0 = 9 tasses more  
So, in summary, Mary should add 11 tasses of sugar and 9 tasses of salt to her mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 tasses of sugar and she needs to add 7 - 4 = 3 more tasses of sugar. So, she must add 3 more tasses of sugar.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 tasses of sugar and she needs to add more sugar and flour according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 12 tasses of sugar and 14 tasses of flour. So we can start by subtracting what she has already added from the total amount needed:  
12 - 10 = 2 (tasses of sugar)  
Now let's find out how much flour she needs to add:  
14 - 10 = 4 (tasses of flour) Therefore, Mary should add 2 tasses of sugar and 4 tasses of flour to complete her cake."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain and 60 families have left for winter. So, if we subtract the number of families that have left (60) from the total number of families (19), we get:  
19 - 60 =? 
The difference between the two numbers is 41. Therefore, 41 families of birds have stayed behind for the winter."
Response:  If there are 87 families of birds living near the mountain and 7 families have left for winter, then 80 families (87 - 7 = 80) of birds have remained behind.
"Response:  We know that 20 families of birds have left for warmer climates and 14 families are staying behind. To find out how many families were originally living near the mountain, we can subtract the number of families that left from the total number of families. So, if we let X be the original number of families living near the mountain, we can write an equation as follows:
X - 20 = 14
Solving for X, we get:
X = 34
Therefore, there were 34 families of birds living near the mountain at the beginning of winter."
"Response:  We know that there are 85 families of birds living near the mountain and 23 families have moved to Africa and 37 families have moved to Asia. So we can subtract the number of families that have moved away from the total number of families to find out how many families remain near the mountain.  
85 - (23 + 37) = 85 - 60 = 25  
Therefore, 25 families of birds remain near the mountain during winter."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 families of birds living near the mountain and 42 families have left for Africa and 31 families have left for Asia. So, in total, 42 + 31 = 73 families of birds have left their homes near the mountain. Now, we need to find out how many more families have left for Africa than for Asia. To do this, we can subtract the number of families that have left for Asia from the total number of families that have left:  
73 - 31 = 42. Therefore, 42 families of birds have left for Africa more than have left for Asia."
"Response:  We know that there are 38 families of birds living near the mountain and 47 families have gone to Africa, so the number of families left is:  
38 - 47 = 11 families of birds left near the mountain. 
Now we know that 94 families of birds have gone to Asia, so the difference between the number of families that went to Asia and the number of families that went to Africa is:  
94 - 47 = 47 families of birds more in Asia than in Africa."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 families of birds living near the mountain and 38 families have gone to Africa, so the number of families left is:  
18 - 38 = 10. 
And we also know that 80 families have gone to Asia, so the total number of families that have migrated is:  
10 + 80 = 90."
"Response:  We know that there are initially 87 families of birds living near the mountain and then 18 new families join them. So, in total, we have:

87 + 18 = 105 families of birds living near the mountain now."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 49 families of birds living near the mountain. If 59 families left for the winter and 24 new families came from the Arctic, we can calculate how many families are still living near the mountain as follows:

49 (initial number) - 59 (families that left) =? (number of families remaining)

Adding 24 to the result gives us the final number of families living near the mountain:

? + 24 = 49

Solving for the missing value, we get:

? = 25

Therefore, 25 families of birds remained near the mountain during the winter."
"Response:  If there were initially 41 families of birds living near the mountain and 27 families have migrated for winter, then the number of families that remained near the mountain is:  
41 - 27 = 14. "
"Response:  We know that initially there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain and 86 families have migrated to warmer climates for winter. So, we can calculate how many more families left than stayed behind as follows:  

86 - 45 = 41
Therefore, 41 families of birds more have migrated for the winter compared to those who remained near the mountain."
"Response:  We know that there are 41 families of birds living near the mountain and 35 families have gone to Asia, so the number of families left is:

41 - 35 = 6

Now we know that 62 families have gone to Africa, so the difference between the number of families that went to Africa and the number of families that went to Asia can be calculated as follows:

62 - 35 = 27

Therefore, there are 27 more families of birds that have gone to Africa than to Asia."
Response:  We know that there are initially 3 families of birds living near the mountain and 26 new families have come from the Arctic to live nearby. This means that in total, there are now 3 + 26 = 29 families of birds living near the mountain. However, we also know that 2 families of birds have left for warmer climates, so the number of families remaining near the mountain is 29 - 2 = 27. Therefore, there are 27 families of birds remaining near the mountain during the winter season.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 253 crayons and lost or gave away 70 of them. So, to find out how many crayons he has left, we need to subtract 70 from 253. Here's the calculation:  

253 - 70 = 183

So, at the end of the school year, Paul had 183 crayons left."
Response:  We know that Paul had 551 crayons at first and he lost or gave away 374 (551 - 177). So, he received 177 crayons for his birthday.
"Response:  First, we know that Paul received 440 crayons as a gift. Then, he gave 111 crayons to his friends. So, how many crayons does he have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the total number of crayons he had. In this case, we can do that by subtracting 111 from 440: 
440 - 111 =? 
Do you know the answer? It's 329! That means Paul has 329 crayons left after giving some to his friends and losing a few."
"Response:  We know that Paul received 65 crayons as a gift and gave away 213 crayons during the school year. So, if we subtract the number of crayons he received from the number of crayons he gave away, we can find out how many crayons were lost or given away.  

65 (received) - 213 (given away) =?

Let's do the subtraction:

65 - 213 =?

Do you want to try solving this problem?"
"Response:  We know that Paul gave 571 crayons to his friends and lost 161. So if we subtract the number of crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he had, we can find out how many more crayons he has given away than he has lost.  
571 - 161 = 409
So, Paul has given 409 more crayons to his friends than he has lost."
"Response:  We know that Paul gave 90 crayons to his friends and lost 412 crayons in total. So, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the total number of crayons he had:  
412 - 90 = 322  
Therefore, Paul has lost 322 more crayons than the ones he gave away to his friends."
Response:  We know that Paul received x crayons for his birthday and gave 563 to his friends during the school year. This means he has 332 crayons left (563 - 558 = 332). To find out how many crayons he received, we can subtract the number of crayons he lost from the number of crayons he had at the beginning: 332 - 558 = -226. So, Paul received 226 crayons for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received a box of crayons for his birthday and he had 52 crayons at first. He gave some to his friends during the school year, so let's subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the total number of crayons he started with. If he gave 52 crayons away, then he has 52 - 52 = 0 crayons left. Now we are told that he only has 492 crayons left, so we can subtract this number from zero to find out how many crayons were lost or given away.  492 - 0 = 492. Therefore, Paul lost or gave away 492 crayons during the school year.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 521 crayons and 66 erasers as birthday presents. At the end of the school year, he had only 154 crayons left without losing any erasers. So we can start by subtracting the number of crayons he had at the end from the total number he received to find out how many crayons he used or gave away during the year.  
521 - 154 =... 
Now let's simplify the equation.  
521 - 154 =... 367  
So Paul lost or gave away 367 crayons during the school year."
"Response:  We know that Paul received 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 391 crayons left without losing any erasers. So we can start by writing an equation to represent this information:

Let C be the number of crayons Paul had at the beginning (C = 531)
Let G be the number of erasers he had (G = 38)

We know that Paul didn't lose any erasers, so the number of erasers he has now is equal to the number he started with:

G = 38 (at the beginning)
G = 38 (now)

Now, let's find out how many crayons Paul has left:

C - G = C - 38
C - 38 = 391

Solving for C, we get:

C = 423

So Paul has 423 crayons left, which is more than the number of erasers he has (38)."
Response:  We know that Paul had 601 crayons and 406 erasers at first. If he didn't lose any erasers, then he must have used all of them to erase something. So, if he has 336 erasers left, that means he used 72 erasers (406 - 336 = 72). Now we need to find out how many crayons he has left. Since there are 601 crayons in total, and he used 72 erasers, that means he still has 529 crayons left (601 - 72 = 529). Therefore, Paul has 336 erasers more than crayons.
"Response:  We know that Paul received 315 crayons for his birthday and he had 291 left at the end of the school year. So, we can subtract the number of crayons he had left from the total number he received to find out how many he received for his birthday:  

291 - 315 =?

Do you want to try solving this problem?"
"Response:  We know that Paul has received 267 crayons and he lost 231 of them during the school year. So, how many crayons does he have left?  
To find out, we can subtract the number of crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he had:

267 - 231 = 36

So, Paul has 36 crayons left. Now, we are asked to find out how many more crayons he gave to his friends than the ones he lost. To do this, we need to compare the number of crayons he gave away (308) with the number of crayons he lost (231):

308 - 231 = 77

Therefore, Paul gave 77 more crayons to his friends than he lost."
"Response:  We know that Paul received 457 gummies and 320 crayons in total for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 523 objects left without losing any gummies or crayons. So we can start by listing what Paul had at the beginning of the year:  
Gummies: 457  
Crayons: 320 Now let's subtract how many gummies Paul used during the year:  
Gummies Used = Total Gummies - Remaining Gummies  
= 457 - 523  
= -66 (negative because he used more than he started with) Now let's add up all the remaining crayons:  
Crayons Left = Total Crayons - Crayons Used  
= 320 - (-66)  
= 386 Finally, we can compare the number of crayons to the number of gummies Paul has left:  
Number of Crayons Left > Number of Gummies Left  
386 > 523 Therefore, Paul had more crayons left than gummies left."
Response:  If there were initially 11 clients and now there are 3 left, then we can say that 8 clients have left (11 - 3 = 8). So, those who stayed behind are 3, and those who left are 8 more than them.
"Response:  If the server had 3 clients and then some of them left, it means that the number of clients decreased by some amount. So if the server now has 4 clients, the difference between the current number of clients and the original number must be equal to the number of clients who left. In other words, we can set up an equation as follows:

4 - 3 = x (where x is the number of clients who left)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

So one client remained with the server after some others left."
"Response:  We know that after 9 clients left, the server had 12 clients remaining. So we can start with 12 as our base number. Now let's subtract 9 from 12 to find out how many clients the server had at first.  
12 - 9 = 3
So the server had 3 clients at first."
Response:  If there were initially 14 clients and 5 left, then there are 14 - 5 = 9 clients remaining.
"Response:  We know that the server had 13 clients initially and then gained 4 new ones. So, in total, he has 13 + 4 = 17 clients now. If he still has 9 clients, we can subtract 9 from 17 to find out how many clients have left:  
17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, 8 clients are gone or have left the server."
Response:  If there were initially 12 clients and 15 left, then there would be 12 - 15 = -3 clients. Since we know that there are now 14 new clients, so the total number of clients is 3 + 14 = 17 clients. Therefore, the server has 17 clients remaining.
"Response:  We know that the server had 3 clients initially and then had 8 clients in total after some other clients arrived. So we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:  
3 + x = 8 
Where ""x"" is the number of new clients who arrived. Now solve for ""x"". 
3 + x = 8 
X = 5 
Therefore, 5 new clients arrived at the server."
"Response:  We know that the server had 8 clients initially and then some of them left, leaving him with 5 clients. So, we can start by subtracting 8 from 5 to find out how many clients left:

5 - 8 =?

The result is:

5 - 8 = -3

So, 3 clients left."
Response:  First, we know that the server had 12 clients initially. Then, some of them left, and he was left with 14 clients (since some clients stayed). So, if x is the number of clients who left, then 12 - x = 14. Now, new clients arrived, and 10 of them joined the server. So, the total number of clients now is 12 - x + 10. Can you solve for x to find out how many clients are currently at the server?
"Response:  We know that Dan spent 3 dollars on a chocolate bar and then he had 2 dollars left. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Let x be the initial amount of money Dan had (before buying the chocolate bar).

We know that Dan spent 3 dollars on the chocolate bar, so he has 2 dollars left:

x - 3 = 2

Now solve for x:

x = 5

So Dan initially had 5 dollars."
"Response:  We know that Dan had $4 and he spent some money to buy a chocolate bar. After buying the chocolate bar, he was left with $3. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

$4 - x = $3

Where x is the cost of the chocolate bar. Solving for x, we get:

x = $1

So the chocolate bar cost $1."
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $99 x $3 = $297 on candy bars. So how much money does he have left? We can subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount of money to find out. If Dan had $400 and spent $297, then he has $400 - $297 = $103 left.
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $3 and bought two bars of chocolate at the same price. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the cost of one bar of chocolate (x = $). 
We know that Dan spent $3, so he paid 3 times the cost of one bar of chocolate: 

3x = $3 

Now we are given that Dan bought two bars of chocolate, so we can write: 

2x = $6 

Simplifying the equation: 

2x = 3x 

Solving for x: 

x = $3 

Therefore, each bar of chocolate costs $3."
"Response:  We know that Dan has $2 and he spent $6 to buy some bars of chocolate. So we can start with this equation:

$2 - $6 = $0 (Dan has no more money)

Now let's look at how much each bar of chocolate costs:

$6 / 3 = $2 (each bar costs $2)

So if Dan spent $6, he must have bought 3 bars of chocolate!"
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $2 + $3 = $5 on chocolate. So he has $7 - $5 = $2 left.
Response:  First, we know that Dan spent $7 on the barre of chocolate and $6 on the chocolate. So in total, he spent $7 + $6 = $13.
Response:  We know that Dan spent $6 for the bar of chocolate and $3 for the chocolate. So he has spent in total $6 + $3 = $9. To find out how much he spent for the bar of chocolate compared to the chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the total amount he spent. $9 - $3 = $6. Therefore, Dan spent $6 more for the bar of chocolate than for the chocolate.
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $5 in total and he bought a bar of chocolate for $2 and one chocolate for $3. So we can start by adding up how much he spent on each item:  
$2 + $3 = $5  
Now let's compare how much he spent on each item relative to the cost of the bar of chocolate:  
($3 - $2) / $2 = ($3 - $2) / $5  
Simplifying:  
$1 / $2 = $1 / $5  
So Dan spent twice as much money on the individual chocolate as he did on the bar of chocolate."
Response:  First, Dan spent $8 on a chocolate bar, so he has $4 - $8 = -$4 left. But wait! His friend gave him $5, so now he has $-4 + $5 = $1 left.
"Response:  We know that Dan had $3$ remaining after buying a chocolate bar and he started with $4$. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Let D be the cost of the chocolate bar. Then we can write:  
Dan had $4$ initially, so his total amount before buying the chocolate bar is:  
After buying the chocolate bar, Dan has $4 - D$ left:  
We are told that Dan has $3$ left after buying the chocolate bar, so we can set up an equation using this information:  
Now we can solve for D:  
So the cost of the chocolate bar was $1$."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $3 to buy candy bars and each candy bar costs the same amount of money. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Let x be the cost of one candy bar. Since Dan bought 10 candy bars, he paid 10x. Now we know that Dan spent $3, so we can write an equation:  
10x = 3  To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:  
x = 3/10 x = 0.3 or 30 cents per candy bar. Now we know that each candy bar costs 30 cents. So if Dan spent $3 on candy bars, he spent 3 x 0.3 = 90 cents in total. Therefore, there are $3 - 90 cents = $2.10 left over."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent a total of $4$ dollars and bought two bars of candy, each costing the same amount of money. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the cost of one bar of candy. Since Dan bought two bars, he paid twice as much for both bars: 

2x = Total Amount Spent

We know that the total amount spent is $4$, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:

2x = 4

Now solve for x to find out how much each bar costs:

2x = 4

x = 4/2

x = 2

Therefore, each bar of candy costs $2$."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $3 on the chocolate and $7 on the candy bar. To find out how much more he spent on the candy bar compared to the chocolate, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the cost of the candy bar. So, if we subtract $3 from $7, we get:

$7 - $3 = $4

So, Dan spent $4 more on the candy bar than he did on the chocolate."
"Response:  We know that Dan spent $4 in total and he bought a chocolate for $7 and a candy bar for $2. So we can start by subtracting what he spent on the candy bar from his total spending to find out how much he spent on the chocolate.  
$4 - $2 = $2 
So Dan spent $2 on the candy bar. Now let's compare how much he spent on the chocolate to how much he spent on the candy bar. 
$7 - $2 = $5 
Dan spent $5 more on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar."
Response:  If Paul had 115 pounds and sold 78 pounds at the garage sale, then he has 115 - 78 = 37 pounds left.
"Response:  We know that Paul had x books at first and sold 137 of them during the garage sale. So, he has x - 137 books left. The problem states that he has 105 books left after the sale, so we can set up an equation:

x - 137 = 105

Solving for x, we get:

x = 242

So, Paul had 242 books at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and sold some of them during the garage sale. After selling those books, he had 62 books left. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

108 - x = 62

Where ""x"" is the number of books Paul sold during the garage sale. Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 46

So Paul sold 46 books during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had $50$ and he spent some of it to buy books during a garage sale. So, we can start with the equation:

$$50 - x = 151$$

where $x$ is the amount of money Paul spent on books. To solve for $x$, we can add $50$ to both sides of the equation:

$$50 + x = 151 + 50$$

This simplifies to:

$$2x = 201$$

Dividing both sides by $2$ gives us:

$$x = 100$$

So, Paul spent $100$ dollars on books during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 2 books and then he sold some of them during the garage sale. So, if we subtract the number of books he sold from his original total, we can find out how many books he has left.

Let x be the number of books Paul sold. Then, the number of books he has left is:

2 - x

We also know that Paul bought 150 new books after the garage sale. So, if we add the number of books he has left to the number of new books he bought, we can find out how many books he has in total now:

2 - x + 150 = 58

Now, let's solve for x. We can do this by first adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

2 - x + 150 + 2 = 58

This simplifies to:

x + 152 = 58

Subtracting 152 from both sides gives us:

x = 36

So, Paul sold 36 books during the garage sale. He has 2 - 36 = 4 books left."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 21 books and sold some of them during the garage sale. So, he must have had fewer than 21 books after the sale. Right? Well, how many fewer? Okay, let's see... if he sold x books, then he has 21 - x books left. And we also know that he bought 42 new books, so he now has 21 - x + 42 books in total. Now, we are told that he has 15 books left, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

21 - x + 42 = 15

Now, solve for x. Do you see how to do it?"
"Response:  We know that Paul had 71 books and sold some of them during the garage sale. So, let x be the number of books he sold. Then, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

71 - x = 38 (since he bought 38 new books)

Now, we are told that Paul has 116 books in total. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

71 - x + 38 = 116

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 45 (books sold)

So, Paul sold 45 books during the garage sale. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he has now:

116 - 45 = 71

Therefore, Paul bought 71 more books than he sold."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 108 books and 55 styli before the garage sale. After the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 styli left. So we can start by subtracting the number of books and styli he sold from the total number he had before the sale:  

Subtracting the number of books sold from the total number of books:  
108 - x = 66 (where ""x"" is the number of books sold)  

Solving for ""x"":  
x = 42 (Paul sold 42 books during the garage sale.)  

Now let's do the same thing with the styli:  

Subtracting the number of styli sold from the total number of styli:  
55 - y = 59 (where ""y"" is the number of styli sold)  

Solving for ""y"":  
y = 4 (Paul sold 4 styli during the garage sale.)  

So to summarize, Paul sold 42 books and 4 styli during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 106 stylo and he sold some of them during the garage sale. So, if we subtract the number of stylo he has after the sale from the total number of stylo he had before the sale, we can find out how many stylo he sold.  
Let X be the number of stylo Paul sold during the garage sale.  
We know that Paul had 106 stylo before the sale, so the equation is :  
106 - X = 14 (the number of stylo he has after the sale)  
Now solve for X.  
X = 92 (Paul sold 92 stylo during the garage sale)."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 136 books initially and he sold some of them during the garage sale. He is left with 27 books now. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  
Let T be the number of books Paul sold during the garage sale. Then we can write:  
136 - T = 27 (since Paul has 27 books left) Now solve for T :  
T = 136 - 27 T = 109 Books Paul sold during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 134 books and gave 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then we know that after selling some of his books at a garage sale, he was left with 68 books. So let's subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he had: 95 - x = 68. Solving for ""x"" gives us x = 27. Therefore, Paul sold 27 books during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 95 pens and 153 books at first. After selling some books and pens during the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So we can start by writing down what we know:

Let P be the number of pens Paul sold during the garage sale (since we don't know how many books he sold).
Let B be the number of books Paul sold during the garage sale (again, we don't know how many pens he sold).
We know that Paul started with 95 pens and 153 books.
After the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 pens left.
So let's write down these equations based on the information given in the problem:

1. 95 - P = 23 (since Paul has 23 pens left after the garage sale)
2. 153 - B = 13 (since Paul has 13 books left after the garage sale)
Now we need to solve for P and B using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving equation 1 for P, we get:
P = 95 - 23 = 72
Now substitute this value into equation 2:
153 - B = 13 + 72 = 85
Solving for B, we get:
B = 68
Therefore, Paul sold 72 pens and 68 books during the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had 42 pencils and 143 books at first. After selling some books and pencils during the garage sale, he was left with 113 books and 19 pencils. So we can start by writing down what we know:

Let P be the number of pencils Paul sold during the garage sale.
Let B be the number of books Paul sold during the garage sale.
We know that P + B = 42 (the number of pencils Paul had initially) - 19 (the number of pencils Paul had after the garage sale).
We also know that B + 113 (the number of books Paul had after the garage sale) = 143 (the number of books Paul had initially).
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for P and B?"
Response:  There were initially 10 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica added 8 more roses from her garden of flowers. So, now there are 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase.
"Response:  We know that there were roses in the vase to start with because it says ""Il y avait des roses dans le vase"" which means ""There were roses in the vase."" So we can say that x roses were already in the vase at the beginning (where x is any number). Then Jessica added 16 more roses from her garden of flowers, so now there are x + 16 roses in the vase. Finally, it tells us that there are currently 23 roses in the vase, so we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 16 = 23
To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:
x + 16 - 16 = 23 - 16
x = 7
So there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 2 roses in the vase and Jessica threw out 4 roses from the vase. So, if we subtract 4 from 2, we get:  
2 - 4 = 0 
Now, we are told that there are 23 roses in the vase. If we add 0 (which is what we got when we subtracted 4 from 2) to 23, we get:  
23 + 0 = 23 
Therefore, Jessica cut 23 roses from her garden to put into the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 33 of them. So, if we subtract 33 from 15, we get:  
15 - 33 = -18 
Now, we are told that there are currently 17 roses in the vase. If we add 17 to -18, we get:  
-18 + 17 = 9 
So, Jessica has cut 9 more roses than she threw away."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 21 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase. So, if we subtract 34 from 21, we get:  

21 - 34 = -13 

Now, let's add the number of new roses she cut from her garden to find out how many roses are left in the vase:  

-13 + 15 = 2 

Therefore, Jessica threw away 13 more roses than she cut from her garden."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 7 roses in the vase and Jessica added more from her garden of flowers. If she had 59 roses in her garden and added some to the vase, then she must have added all of them because now there are 20 roses in the vase. So, if we subtract 7 (the original number) from 20, we get:  

20 - 7 = 13 

Therefore, Jessica cut 13 roses from her garden to add to the vase."
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica added 12 more from her garden. So, if we add 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Now, we are told that there are 21 roses in the vase, so we can subtract 21 - 25 = 4 roses left in the garden.
"Response:  We know that there were originally 15 roses and 62 orchidées in the vase. Jessica added more flowers from her garden to the vase. Now, there are 17 roses and 96 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the original number of roses (15) from the new number of roses (17).  
Subtraction Problem: 17 - 15 = 
Answer: Jessica cut 2 roses."
Response:  We know that there were originally 12 roses and 2 orchidées in the vase. Jessica added some more flowers from her garden of flowers. Now, there are 10 roses and 21 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many orchidées Jessica cut, we can subtract the original number of orchidées (2) from the new total number of orchidées (21). So, Jessica cut 19 orchidées (21 - 2 = 19).
Response:  We know that there were originally 5 roses and 3 orchidées in the vase. Jessica added some more flowers from her garden to the vase. So, if we add 5 (the original number of roses) + 3 (the original number of orchidées) = 8 flowers to the vase. Now, there are 12 roses and 2 orchidées in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchidées are in the vase now, we can subtract the number of orchidées from the total number of roses:  12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 more roses than orchidées in the vase now.
"Response:  We know that there were originally 7 roses and 12 orchidées in the vase. Jessica added some more flowers from her garden to the vase. So, if we subtract the original number of roses and orchidées from the total number of each flower type now, we can find out how many more of each type of flower are in the vase now compared to before.  
Let's start with the roses. There were originally 7 roses, and now there are 11 roses. To find out how many more roses there are now, we can subtract 7 (the original number) from 11: 11 - 7 = 4. So, there are 4 more roses in the vase now than there were before.  
Now let's look at the orchidées. There were originally 12 orchidées, and now there are 20. To find out how many more orchidées there are now, we can subtract 12 (the original number) from 20: 20 - 12 = 8. So, there are 8 more orchidées in the vase now than there were before.  
To summarize, there are 4 more roses and 8 more orchidées in the vase now than there were before."
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 roses in the vase and now there are 19 roses. So we can deduce that Jessica has added 16 more roses to the vase (19 - 3 = 16).
"Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica added some more flowers from her garden. So, we can start with these numbers:

13 (initial number of roses) + x (number of roses added) = 14 (final number of roses)

where x is the unknown number of roses added.

We also know that there were initially 84 orchids in the vase, and now there are 91. So, we can write another equation:

84 (initial number of orchids) + y (number of orchids added) = 91 (final number of orchids)

where y is the unknown number of orchids added.

Now, let's solve for x and y. We can do this by substitution or elimination. For simplicity, let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we get:

x = 14 - 13

x = 1

Now, substitute this value into the second equation:

84 + y = 91

y = 7

So, Jessica added 7 orchids to the vase. To find out how many roses she added, we can substitute y = 7 into the first equation:

13 + 7 = 20

Jessica added 20 roses to the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 16 roses and 3 orchidées in the vase. Jessica has cut some flowers from her garden to add to the vase. Now, there are 7 orchidées and 13 roses in the vase. To find out how many orchidées Jessica has cut, we can subtract the initial number of orchidées (3) from the current number of orchidées (7):  
7 - 3 = 4 
So, Jessica has cut 4 orchidées."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 6 roses and 20 orchidées in the vase. Jessica added some more flowers from her garden to the vase. So now, we have 21 orchidées and 22 roses in total. To find out how many roses are in the vase compared to orchidées, let's subtract the number of orchidées from the total number of roses.  
22 - 21 = 1 
Therefore, there is one rose more than orchidée in the vase."
"Response:  We know that there were originally 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica added some more flowers from her garden to the vase. Now, we have 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. To find out how many more orchids than roses are in the vase now, let's subtract the number of roses from the total number of orchids.  
13 - 3 = 10 
So, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase right now!"
"Response:  We know that Robin had 17 inches of hair and now she has 13 inches of hair. So we can subtract 17 - 13 = 4 inches to find out how much hair she cut off.  
Therefore, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair."
"Response:  If Robin had 20 inches of her hair cut off and now has 10 inches of hair left, we can set up an equation to represent this information.
Let x be the original length of Robin's hair (in inches).
Since she had 20 inches of her hair cut off, her new length is:
x - 20
Now, since she has 10 inches of hair left, we know that her current length is:
x - 20 = 10
To find out what was the original length of Robin's hair before she cut it, we need to solve for x in the above equation.
So, x = 30.
Therefore, the original length of Robin's hair before she cut it was 30 inches."
Response:  First, Robin cut off 11 inches of her hair. Then, she let it grow back for 12 inches. So now, her hair is 11 + 12 = 23 inches long.
Response:  If Robin had 19 inches of hair and grew 18 inches longer, then she now has a total length of 37 inches (19 + 18).
Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of her hair, that means she has 14 - 13 = 1 inch left. So, the length of her remaining hair is 1 inch.
Response:  First, we know that Robin had 14 inches of hair and it grew by 8 inches. So now she has 14 + 8 = 22 inches of hair. Then, she cut off 20 inches. Therefore, her current length of hair is 22 - 20 = 2 inches.
"Response:  If Danny has 12 capsules in his collection and he found 53 more at the park, then we can add 53 to 12 to find out how many capsules Danny now has.  
So, if we add 12 + 53 = 65, that means Danny now has 65 capsules of bottles in his collection."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 21 capsules in his collection and he found some more at the park. So if we add 21 to however many he found, we can find out how many total capsules Danny has now.
Let x be the number of capsules Danny found at the park. Then we can write an equation:
21 + x = 53
To solve for x, we can subtract 21 from both sides:
x = 53 - 21
x = 32
So Danny found 32 capsules at the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 63 capsules of bottles at first and he threw away 51 old ones. So, how many did he have left?  
63 - 51 = 12
Danny had 12 capsules of bottles left after throwing away the old ones. Now, we are told that he has 33 capsules in his collection. How many more does he need to collect?  
12 + 33 = 45
So, Danny needs to collect 45 - 12 = 33 more capsules of bottles to complete his collection."
"Response:  We know that Danny has found 36 capsules of bottles at the park and he threw away 35 old ones. So, if we subtract the number of old capsules he threw away from the total number of capsules he found, we get:  

36 - 35 = 1

Therefore, Danny has found one more capsuled bottle than the ones he threw away."
"Response:  We know that Danny has found 30 capsules of bottles in the park and he had thrown away 63 old ones. So, if we subtract the number of capsules he found from the number of old ones he threw away, we get:  

63 - 30 = 33

Therefore, Danny has thrown away 33 more capsules than the ones he found in the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 22 capsules of bottles and 8 packaging at first. Now he has 28 capsules of bottles and 63 packaging in total. So we can start with this information to find out how many capsules of bottles Danny had initially.  
Let X be the number of capsules of bottles Danny had initially. Since he had 22 capsules of bottles at first, we can write an equation as follows:
X + 22 = 28... (1)
Now let Y be the number of packagings Danny had initially. Since he had 8 packagings at first, we can write another equation as follows:
Y + 8 = 63... (2)
We have two equations (1) and (2), so we can solve them simultaneously to find out the values of X and Y. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
X + 22 + Y + 8 = 63... (3)
Combining like terms, we get:
X + Y + 22 + 8 = 63... (4)
Simplifying further, we get:
X + Y = 53... (5)
Since we are looking for the value of X only, we can substitute equation (5) into equation (1):
X + 22 = 28
Subtracting 22 from both sides gives us:
X = 6
Therefore, Danny had 6 capsules of bottles initially."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 22 capsules of bottles and 30 packaging at first. Now he has 17 capsules of bottles and 57 packaging. So we can start with this information to find out how many packagings Danny had initially.  
Let X be the number of packagings Danny had at first. Since each package contains one or more capsules, we can write an equation based on this fact:
X + (22 x 1) = 30... (1)
where ""22 x 1"" represents the total number of capsules in the packages.
Now, let's look at what we know about Danny's current collection:
17 + (57 x 1) =?...(2)
Since there are 57 packages currently in Danny's collection, we can substitute this value into equation (1):
17 + (57 x 1) = 30 + (57 x 1)
Simplifying both sides of the equation:
17 + 57 = 84
Solving for X:
X = 67
Therefore, Danny had 67 packagings at first."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 30 capsules of bottles and 14 packaging at the park. This means he found 30 + 14 = 44 items in total. Now we are told that Danny has 7 capsules of bottles and 86 packaging. So if we subtract what he started with from what he has now, we get:  
7 (capsules) - 30 (starting amount) = -23  
86 (packaging) - 14 (starting amount) = 72  
So Danny found 23 more capsules than packaging at the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 11 capsules of bottles and 28 packaging at the park. This means he had a total of 39 items in his collection (11 + 28). Now we are told that Danny has 68 capsules of bottles and 51 packaging. So let's subtract what he had before from what he has now to find out how many new packagings he found:  

68 - 39 = 29

So Danny found 29 more packagings than capsules of bottles at the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 71 capsules of bottles and 24 packaging in his collection initially. Now he has 28 capsules of bottles and 16 packaging. To find out how many more capsules than packaging Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of packaging from the number of capsules. So, let's do it!  

28 (capsules) - 16 (packaging) = 12. 
Therefore, Danny has 12 more capsules than packaging."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 10 capsules of bottles and 62 packaging in his collection initially. This means he had 10 + 62 = 72 items in total. Now, we are told that Danny has 27 capsules of bottles and 43 packaging in his collection. So, let's calculate how many more packages than capsules Danny has now:  
43 - 27 = 16. 
Therefore, Danny has 16 more packages than capsules."
"Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 capsules of bottles at the park and now he has 25 capsules in his collection. So we can start with this equation:

25 = 66 - x

Where ""x"" is the number of capsules Danny had at first. To solve for ""x"", we can add both sides of the equation:

25 + 66 = 66 + x

Now we have:

91 = x

So Danny had 91 capsules of bottles at the beginning."
"Response:  If Danny had 25 capsules of bottles in his collection before he found some at the park and now he has 32 capsules, then we can subtract 25 from 32 to find out how many more capsules he found at the park.  
So, if Danny found x capsules at the park, we know that:
x = 32 - 25
x = 7
Therefore, Danny found 7 additional capsules of bottles at the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 60 old capsules and found 58 new ones. So he has in total:  
60 + 58 = 118 capsules."
Response:  We know that Danny had 6 old capsules and threw them away, so he started with 6 - 6 = 0 new capsules. Then, he found 50 more capsules at the park, so now he has a total of 50 + 0 = 50 capsules. To find out how many more capsules Danny found at the park compared to the ones he threw away, we need to subtract the number of old capsules from the total number of capsules he has now: 50 - 6 = 44. So, Danny found 44 more capsules at the park than he had before.
"Response:  We know that Danny has thrown away 54 old capsules and found 48 new ones. So if we subtract the number of old capsules he threw away from the total number of capsules he had before (which is 52), we get:  
52 - 54 = 0. This means that Danny has thrown away exactly as many capsules as he found at the park! Therefore, there are no more capsules to count. The correct answer is 0."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 82 emballages and 29 capsules de bouteilles at first. If he has 42 capsules de bouteilles now, then he must have started with x capsules de bouteilles.
We can set up an equation to represent this information:
Let x be the number of capsules de bouteilles Danny had at first.
Then, we know that Danny collected 82 - x emballages.
He also collected 29 capsules de bouteilles.
So, in total, Danny collected (82 - x) + 29 = 111 items.
Now, we are told that Danny has 42 capsules de bouteilles, so we can set up another equation:
x + 42 = 111
Solving for x, we get:
x = 70
Therefore, Danny had 70 capsules de bouteilles at first."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 66 emballages and 39 capsules of bottles at first. If he has 16 capsules now, then he must have found 23 more capsules (since there are only 39 in total). So, if we subtract the number of capsules he had before from the total number of capsules he has now, we get:  

39 - 16 = 23

Now, let's look at the emballages. He had 66 initially, and now he has 68. That means he found 2 more emballages (since there are only 2 more than the initial amount). Therefore, the difference between the number of emballages he had before and the number of emballages he has now is:  

66 - 68 = -2

So, to find out how many emballages Danny had at first, we need to add 2 to the number of emballages he has now:  

68 + 2 = 70

Therefore, Danny had 70 emballages at first."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 46 emballages and 50 capsules of bottles at the park. Now he has 21 capsules of bottles and 52 emballages in his collection. To find out how many more capsules than embellishments Danny found at the park, we need to subtract the number of embellishments from the number of capsules.  
Number of capsules - Number of embellishments = How many more capsules than embellishments Danny found  
50 - 46 = 4  
So, Danny found 4 more capsules than embellishments at the park."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 65 emballages and 5 capsules of bottles in his collection before he went to the park. Now, we are told that he has 31 capsules of bottles and 9 emballages in his collection after going to the park. So, let's subtract the number of items he had before from the number of items he has now:  

65 - 5 = 60 (number of emballages he had before)  
60 - 9 = 51 (number of emballages he has now)  

Now, let's find out how many more emballages Danny has than capsules of bottles:  
51 - 31 = 20 (number of emballages more than capsules)  

So, Danny found 20 more emballages at the park than capsules of bottles."
"Response:  We know that Danny has 11 emballages and 12 capsules of bottles in his collection now. So we can start by comparing these numbers:  
11 (emballages) < 12 (capsules de bouteille) 
Since ""less than"" means there is a difference between the two numbers, let's find out how many more capsules Danny has compared to emballages : 
12 - 11 = 1 
So Danny has one more capsuled de bouteille than embellage. Therefore, the answer is 1."
"Response:  We know that Danny had 18 emballages and 15 capsules of bottles in his collection before he found more items at the park. So we can start by writing an equation to represent this information:  
Let E be the number of emballages Danny has.  
Let C be the number of capsules of bottles Danny has.  
We know that E + C = 18 + 15 = 33. Now we are given that Danny now has 67 emballages and 35 capsules of bottles. So we can write another equation:  
E + C = 67 + 35 = 102. Now we have two equations and two unknowns (E and C). Can you use substitution or elimination to solve for E?"
"Response:  We know that Jake has 17 peaches and Steven has x peaches (where x is the number of peaches that Jake has minus 11). So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Jake has 17 peaches:

17 = x + 11

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

17 - 11 = x + 11 - 11

6 = x

So Steven has 6 peaches."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 15 peaches and Jill has 14 peaches less than Steven. So, if we subtract 14 from 15, we get:  
15 - 14 = 1  
Now, we are told that Jake has 7 peaches fewer than Jill. Therefore, if we subtract 7 from 1, we get:  
1 - 7 = -6  
So, Jake has -6 peaches."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven and Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill. So we can start with these two equations:

Jake - Steven = 18... (1)
Steven - Jill = 13... (2)
Now let's solve for Jill in equation (2):

Steven - Jill = 13
Substituting from equation (1), we get:

Steven - Jill = Jake + 13
Simplifying:

Jill = Steven - Jake - 13
So Jill has 19 - 18 - 13 = 8 peaches."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill and he has 5 peaches in total. So, if we subtract 5 from 8, we get 3. Therefore, Jill has 3 peaches less than Steven. Now, let's find out how many peaches Jake has compared to Jill. We are told that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Jill. If Jill has x peaches, then Jake will have x - 3 peaches. To find x, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's use ""x"" as our variable for the number of peaches Jill has. Here is the equation based on the information provided:

Jill = x (number of peaches)
Steven = x + 8 (number of peaches)
Jake = x - 3 (number of peaches)

Now, we need to solve this system of equations. First, we can substitute Jake's information into the first two equations:

Jill = x
Steven = x + 8
Jake = x - 3

Next, we can simplify each equation:

Jill = x
Steven = x + 8
Jake = x - 3

Now, we can add the first two equations together to eliminate one of the variables:

2(Jill + Steven) = 2(Jake + Jill) + 16

Simplifying further:

4x + 16 = 2x + 8

Solving for x:

4x = 2x + 8

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

2x = 8

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 4

So, Jill has 4 peaches. Now, we can calculate how many peaches Jake has compared to Jill:

Jake = Jill - 3
= 4 - 3
= 1

Therefore, Jake has 1 more peach than Jill."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 4 more peaches than Jake and Jill has 11 more peaches than Jake. So we can start with what we know about Jake. 
Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches. Now let's find out how many peaches Jill has compared to Jake. 
We know that Jill has 11 more peaches than Jake, so if Jake has 8 peaches, then Jill has 8 + 11 = 19 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 19 - 8 = 11 more peaches than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 less than Steven and 9 more than Jill. So we can start with what we know about Steven:  
Steven has 16 peaches. Now let's find out how many peaches Jake has. 
Jake has 7 less than Steven, so if we subtract 7 from 16, we get: 
16 - 7 = 9 
So Jake has 9 peaches."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more peaches than Jill. So we can start with what Steven has:  
Steven has 17 peaches. Now let's find out how many peaches Jake has:  
Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has:  
17 - 7 = 10 peaches. Finally, let's find out how many peaches Jill has:  
Jill has 8 more peaches than Jake, so Jill has:  
10 + 8 = 18 peaches. Therefore, Jill has 18 peaches."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven and 18 more peaches than Jill. So we can start with what we know about Jake's number of peaches:  
Jake = 16 - 9 = 7  
Now let's find out how many peaches Steven has:  
Steven = 16 + 9 = 25  
Finally, let's compare the number of peaches Steven has to the number of peaches Jill has:  
Steven - Jill = 25 - 7 = 18  
So Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, so if Jill has 5 peaches, then Steven has 18 + 5 = 23 peaches. Now we are told that Jake is 6 peaches less than Steven, so Jake has 23 - 6 = 17 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 17 peaches.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill, so if Jill has x peaches, then Steven has x + 18 peaches. 
We also know that Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x + 18 peaches, then Jake has x + 18 - 5 = x + 13 peaches. 
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 13 = 87 (since Jill has 87 peaches)
Solving for x gives us:
x = 70
So Jake has 70 + 13 = 83 peaches more than Jill."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, so if Jill has x peaches, then Steven has x + 15 peaches. 
We also know that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x + 15 peaches, then Jake has x + 15 - 16 = x + 15 - 16 = x + 1 peach.  
Now we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 15 = Jill's number of peaches
x + 1 = Jake's number of peaches
Since Jill has 12 peaches, we can substitute her number into one of the equations to solve for x:
12 + 15 = Jill's number of peaches
12 + 15 = x + 15
13 = x + 15
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:
12 = x
So, Jill has 12 peaches and Jake has 1 peach. To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we can subtract their numbers:
12 - 1 = 11
Therefore, Jill has 11 more peaches than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 79 more apples. So if we subtract 12 from Steven's number of peaches, we can find out how many peaches Jake has.  
Let S represent Steven's total fruit (peaches + apples). Then we can write an equation based on the information given: 
S = 19 + 14 = 33 
Now, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. To do this, we subtract 12 from S: 
J = S - 12 
Substituting S = 33, we get: 
J = 33 - 12 = 21 
Therefore, Jake has 21 peaches."
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven and 3 more apples. So if Steven has 9 peaches and 8 apples, then Jake must have 9 - 13 = 4 peaches and 8 + 3 = 11 apples. Therefore, Jake has 4 peaches and 11 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven and 8 more apples. So if Steven has x peaches, Jake will have x - 6 peaches. And if Steven has x apples, Jake will have x + 8 apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information. Let's call the number of peaches Steven has ""x"". Then we can say that Jake has x - 6 peaches, and Steven has x apples. Additionally, we know that Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so we can say that Jake has x + 8 apples. Now we can set up our equation:

x + 8 = x + 6 + x

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 3x + 6

Subtracting 3x from both sides:

x + 5 = 6

Solving for x:

x = 4

So Steven has 4 peaches and 16 apples (since he has 16 more apples than Jake). To find out how many more peaches Steven has than poms, we need to subtract the number of poms he has from the number of peaches he has:

4 (peaches) - 16 (poms) = 2

Therefore, Steven has 2 more peaches than poms."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven and 10 more apples. So if Steven has x peaches, Jake will have x - 3 peaches. And if Steven has x peaches, Jake will have x + 10 apples. Now we need to find out how many apples Steven has. According to the problem, Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x - 3) = 12 + 15

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 3 = 27

Solving for x:

x = 14

So Steven has 14 peaches and 15 apples. To find out how many more apples Steven has than peaches, we subtract the number of peaches from the total number of apples:

15 - 14 = 1

Therefore, Steven has one more apple than peach."
"Response:  We know that Steven has 12 peaches and Jake has 4 fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract 4 from 12, we get:
Jake has 8 peaches."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 peaches and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven. So Jake has 18 - 12 = 6 peaches. Now we are told that Jake has 8 more than Jill, so Jill has 6 + 8 = 14 peaches.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 19 peaches and Jake has 12 fewer than Steven. So, if we subtract 12 from 19, we get:

Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 peaches."
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 peaches and Jake has 6 fewer than Steven. So Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peaches. Now we are told that Jake has 3 more than Jill. Therefore, Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 peaches.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer peaches. So if we add up all of these numbers, we can find out how many peaches Jake has!  
First, let's calculate how many apples Jake has:  
84 + 52 = 136  
Now we need to subtract 10 from this number because Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven:  
136 - 10 = 126  
So Jake has 126 peaches in total!"
"Response:  We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven and 17 fewer peaches. So if we start with the number of peaches Steven has (8), we can subtract 17 to find out how many peaches Jake has.  
8 - 17 = -9 
Since Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, he must have 9 more apples. Now, let's add 13 to the number of apples Steven has to find out how many apples Jake has.  
12 + 13 = 25 
Therefore, Jake has 25 apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven and 10 more apples. So if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 8 peaches. And since Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, we can say that Jake has x + 10 apples. Now let's set up an equation based on this information. We have:

x + 10 = 11 (since Steven has 11 apples)

Substituting x for the first equation, we get:

(x - 8) + 10 = 11

Combine like terms:

x - 8 + 10 = 11

Solve for x:

x = 20

So Steven has 20 peaches and 11 apples. To find out how many more peaches Steven has than apples, we subtract 11 from 20:

20 - 11 = 9

Therefore, Steven has 9 more peaches than apples."
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven and 4 more apples. So if Steven has x peaches, Jake will have x - 3 peaches. And if Steven has x apples, Jake will have x + 4 apples. Now we can set up an equation based on this information. Let's call the number of peaches that Steven has ""x"". Then we can say that Jake has x - 3 peaches and Steven has x apples. Okay, so now we need to find out how many apples Steven has in total. Well, he has 19 apples, so we can write down the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 19 + 4

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 3 = 23

Solving for x:

2x = 26

x = 13

So Steven has 13 peaches and 19 apples in total. To find out how many more apples Steven has than peaches, we just subtract the number of peaches from the total number of apples:

19 - 13 = 6

Therefore, Steven has 6 more apples than peaches."
"Response:  Olivia had $78 in her wallet and spent $15 at the grocery store. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she had. Here's the calculation:
$78 - $15 = $63
So, Olivia has $63 left in her wallet after spending $15 at the grocery store."
"Response:  We know that Olivia spent $78 at the grocery store and she has $33 left. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$78 - $33 = x

Where x is the amount of money Olivia had initially. To solve for x, we can add $33 to both sides of the equation:

$78 + $33 = $x + $33

This simplifies to:

$111 = x

So Olivia had $111 initially."
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $100 in her wallet to start with. Then she took out an additional $148 from an ATM machine. So, how much did she have altogether?  
$100 + $148 = $248  
Now we know that after visiting the grocery store, there was $159 left in her wallet. What is the difference between what she spent and what she started with?  
$248 - $159 = $99  
So, Olivia spent $99 at the grocery store."
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $3 in her wallet to start with and she collected $49 more from an ATM. So, her total amount of money after visiting the supermarket is:

$3 + $49 = $52

We also know that she spent some amount at the supermarket, but we don't know how much. Let's call the amount she spent x. Then, we can write the equation:

$52 - x = $49

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add $52 and $x:

$52 + x = $52 + $49

Simplifying, we get:

$52 + x = $101

Subtracting $52 from both sides gives us:

x = $49

So, Olivia spent $49 at the supermarket. Therefore, the amount she collected from the ATM was $49 more than what she spent at the supermarket."
Response:  We know that Olivia had $53 in her wallet to start with and she took out an additional $91 from the ATM. So, in total, she has $53 + $91 = $144. After visiting the grocery store, there was $14 left in her wallet. Therefore, she spent $144 - $14 = $130 at the grocery store.
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $106 in her wallet at first and she spent $49 at the art gallery. So, how much did she spend at the grocery store? To find out, we need to subtract the amount she spent at the art gallery from the original amount of money she had. Here's the calculation:
$106 - $49 = $57
So, Olivia spent $57 at the grocery store."
"Response:  We know that Olivia had $54 in her wallet and she spent some amount of money at the supermarket. After shopping, she had $29 left. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  
Let X be the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket.  
Since she had $54 before going to the store, we know that:  
Now we are told that after spending money, Olivia has $29 left. Therefore, we can write another equation based on this information:  
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (X and Y). Can you solve for X? Think carefully!"
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the grocery store, that means she has $128 - $38 = $90 left in her wallet.
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone.
Response:  If Dave had 5 apps left after deleting 18, then he must have had at least 5 + 18 = 23 apps on his phone to start with.
"Response:  If Dave had 10 applications and added 11 new ones, then he had a total of 10 + 11 = 21 applications. After removing some, he was left with 4 applications. So, we can subtract 4 from 21 to find out how many applications Dave removed:

21 - 4 = 17

Therefore, Dave removed 17 applications."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 21 applications before he added new ones and after subtracting some of them, he was left with 24 applications. So we can set up an equation to represent this information as follows:

21 + x = 24... (where x is the number of new applications added)

Now let's solve for x. To do so, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation:

21 + x = 24

Subtracting 21 from both sides gives us:

x = 3

So Dave added 3 more applications than he deleted."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 15 apps before adding new ones and he ended up with 14 after removing some of them. So, we can start by finding out how many apps he added:  
71 - 15 = 56  
Now we need to find out how many apps he removed. To do this, we subtract the number of apps he added from the total number of apps he had after adding and removing apps:  
14 - 56 = -42  
Since the result is negative, it means that Dave removed more apps than he added! In other words, he deleted 42 apps in addition to the 15 he already had."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 16 applications and he deleted some of them. So, if he has 5 applications left, we can subtract 5 from 16 to find out how many applications he deleted:

16 - 5 = 11

So, Dave deleted 11 applications."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications and 21 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So we can start by subtracting the number of applications he had before from the number of applications he has now to find out how many applications he deleted:  

17 - 3 = 14 (applications)

Now let's do the same for the number of files:

21 - 7 = 14 (files)

So Dave deleted 14 applications and 14 files from his phone."
"Response:  If he had 15 applications and 24 files, then after deleting some of them, he has 21 applications and 4 files left. So we can start by comparing the number of applications to the number of files:  

Number of applications = 21  
Number of files = 4  

Now let's subtract the number of files from the number of applications to find out how many more applications he has than files:  

Subtraction:  

21 - 4 = 17  

So Dave has 17 more applications than files on his phone."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone initially. After deleting some apps and files, he is left with 6 applications and 15 files. So we can start by comparing the number of applications to the number of files.  
Dave has 6 applications and 15 files, so let's compare these numbers:

6 (applications) = 15 (files) + x (where x is the number of files remaining on the phone after deleting applications)

We know that Dave deleted some applications, so x must be greater than 0. However, since he still has 15 files, x cannot be too large. A reasonable estimate for x might be around 3 or 4. Therefore, we can solve for x as follows:

x = 15 (files) - 6 (applications)

x = 15 - 6

x = 9

So Dave has 9 more files remaining on his phone than applications."
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 applications on his phone and after adding some more, he has 18 applications now. So we can say that Dave added 1 application to his phone.
"Response:  We know that Dave had 59 files and 15 applications on his phone initially. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So we can start by listing down what we know:

Initially, Dave had:

* 59 files
* 15 applications

After deleting some files and apps, he was left with:

* 30 files
* 12 applications

Now, let's subtract the number of files he had initially from the number of files he has now to find out how many files he deleted:

59 - 30 = 29

So, Dave deleted 29 files.

Next, let's subtract the number of applications he had initially from the number of applications he has now to find out how many applications he deleted:

15 - 12 = 3

So, Dave deleted 3 applications.

Therefore, Dave deleted 29 files and 3 applications."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps on his phone initially. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So we can start by listing down what we know:

Initially, Dave had:

* 24 files
* 13 applications

After deleting some files and apps, he was left with:

* 17 applications (since he deleted some apps)
* 21 files (since he did not delete any files)

Now, let's find out how many files Dave deleted. To do this, we need to subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the number of files he had initially:

24 - 21 = 3

So, Dave deleted 3 files."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone initially. After deleting some of them, he is left with 5 files and 12 applications. So we can start by comparing the number of applications to the number of files:  
12 (applications) - 5 (files) = 7  
Therefore, Dave has 7 more applications than files remaining on his phone."
"Response:  If Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone, he had a total of 11 + 3 = 14 items on his phone. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications, so we can set up an equation to represent this information as follows:

24 (files) + 2 (applications) = 14 (total items)

Solving for the number of files remaining, we get:

24 - 2 = 22

Therefore, Dave has 22 files more than applications on his phone."
Response:  If Nell had 242 cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So there are 106 cards remaining with Nell.
"Response:  We know that Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff and she has 154 cards left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of cards Nell had initially (before giving any to Jeff).

We know that Nell gave 301 cards to Jeff, so the number of cards she has left is:

154 = x - 301

Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 301 to both sides of the equation:

x = 154 + 301

x = 455

So Nell had 455 cards initially before giving any to Jeff."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her total number of cards, we can find out how many cards she has left. Here's the calculation:  
528 - 11 = 517
Nell has 517 cards left after giving some to Jeff."
"Response:  If she had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has 535 cards left. So, if we subtract the number of cards she has from the total number of cards she had, we can find out how many cards Jeff got.  
566 - 535 = 31  
Jeff now has 31 cards."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 309 cards of baseball and 356 cards of 10. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she has fewer cards now. To find out how many more baseball cards she has than 10 cards, we need to subtract the number of 10 cards she has from the number of baseball cards she has. So, let's do that:  
Baseball Cards - 10 Cards = 415 - 149 = 266  
Therefore, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than 10 cards."
"Response:  We know that she had 246 cards of baseball and 214 cards of 10. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 404 cards of baseball and 495 cards of 10. To find out how many more cards of 10 she has than cards of baseball, we can subtract the number of cards of baseball from the total number of cards of 10.  
Card of 10 - Card of Baseball = 495 - 404 = 91
So, she has 91 more cards of 10 than cards of baseball."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 cards and she gave some to John and Jeff. So, we can start by subtracting the number of cards she gave to John from her total number of cards.  
573 - 195 = 378  
Now, we don't know how many cards she gave to Jeff, but we do know that she has 210 cards left. So, if we subtract the number of cards she has left from the number of cards she gave to John, we can find out how many cards she gave to Jeff.  
378 - 210 = 168  
Therefore, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 438 cards in total and she gave some to Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her total number of cards, we can find out how many cards she has left.

Number of cards Nell had = 438
Number of cards she gave to Jeff =? (we don't know yet)

Let's assume that Jeff received x cards. Then, the number of cards Nell has left is:

Number of cards Nell has left = 438 - x

Now, we are given that Nell has 55 cards of 10 and 178 cards of baseball. So, let's add up these two numbers:

55 + 178 = 233

This means that Nell has 233 cards left after giving some to Jeff. But we want to know how many more baseball cards she has than card of 10. To do this, we need to compare the number of baseball cards with the number of cards of 10.

Comparison: 233 (baseball cards) vs. 55 (cards of 10)

Conclusion: Nell has 233 - 55 = 178 more baseball cards than cards of 10."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 239 cards in total and she gave some to Jeff. So, if we subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her total number of cards, we can find out how many cards she has left.  
Nell had 239 cards in total and she gave 38 cards to Jeff (since he had 38 cards). Therefore, the number of cards she has left is:  
239 - 38 = 201  
So, Nell has 201 cards left after giving some to Jeff. Now, let's compare the number of cards she has of each type. She has 376 cards of one type (the 10s) and 111 cards of another type (the baseball cards). To find out how many more cards of one type she has than the other, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number:  
376 - 111 = 265  
Therefore, Nell has 265 more cards of the 10s than she does of the baseball cards."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 35 cookies left after eating 19 of them. So we can start with the equation:  
35 - 19 = x (where x is the number of cookies he had at first) 
Now let's solve for x: 
35 - 19 = x 
x = 16 
So Paco had 16 cookies at first."
Response:  We know that Paco had 28 cookies and he has eaten some of them. So, if we subtract the number of cookies he has eaten from the total number of cookies he had, we can find out how many cookies are left. In this case, there are 7 cookies left. Therefore, Paco must have eaten 21 cookies (28 - 7 = 21).
Response:  First, Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So now he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought 37 more cookies, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total. Therefore, there are 75 - 38 = 37 cookies remaining for Paco.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 20 cookies left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more cookies, so now he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco ate 3 cookies more than the ones he bought.
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 13 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So, how many cookies does he have left?  
13 - 2 = 11
Now, we are told that he bought 36 more cookies. How many cookies did he buy in total?  
11 + 36 = 47
So, Paco bought 47 cookies in total. To find out how many cookies he bought more than the ones he ate, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he bought:  
47 - 2 = 45
Therefore, Paco bought 45 more cookies than the ones he ate."
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, how many cookies does he have left?  
We can use subtraction to find out! If Paco had 40 cookies and ate 5, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. That's right! Paco has 35 cookies remaining after eating 5 of them and giving 13 away to his friend."
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 17 cookies and he gave 13 to his friend. So, how many cookies does Paco have left?  
We can use subtraction to find out. If Paco had 17 cookies and gave 13 away, then he has 17 - 13 = 4 cookies left. 
Now, let's look at how many cookies Paco ate. We are told that he ate 14 cookies. So, if he ate 14 cookies and has 4 cookies left, then he must have eaten more than the number of cookies he gave to his friend. 
To find out how much more, we can subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the total number of cookies he ate. In this case, we can subtract 13 (the number of cookies he gave to his friend) from 14 (the number of cookies he ate): 
14 - 13 = 1 cookie. 
So, Paco ate one more cookie than the number of cookies he gave to his friend."
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 cookies. So, how many cookies did he have left?  
12 - 16 = 0. That means he didn't have any cookies left! But wait, there's more to the problem. It says he gave 21 cookies to his friend. So, if he didn't have any cookies left, where did those 21 cookies come from? Ah ha! The answer is that he gave his friend all of the cookies he had eaten! In other words, he gave his friend 16 cookies (the number of cookies he ate). Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies he ate and the number of cookies he gave to his friend is... 
16 - 16 = 0. That means he gave his friend exactly the same number of cookies that he himself ate!"
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 22 biscuits sucrés and he ate 15 of them. So, how many biscuits sucrés are left?  
22 - 15 =... 
That gives us... 
22 - 15 = 7 
Therefore, there are 7 biscuits sucrés left for Paco."
Response:  We know that Paco had 9 biscuits sucrés and 6 biscuits salés. He ate 36 biscuits sucrés, so he has none left (36 - 9 = 0). And he ate 3 biscuits salés, so he has 6 - 3 = 3 biscuits salés left.
"Response:  We know that Paco had 37 biscuits sucrés and 11 biscuits salés. He ate 5 biscuits sucrés and 2 biscuits salés. To find out how many more sweet biscuits he ate than salty ones, we need to subtract the number of salty biscuits he ate from the number of sweet biscuits he ate. So, if we subtract 2 (the number of salty biscuits) from 5 (the number of sweet biscuits), we get:  
5 - 2 = 3 
So, Paco ate 3 more sweet biscuits than salty ones."
"Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet biscuits and 6 savory biscuits at first. He ate 20 sweet biscuits and 34 savory biscuits in total. To find out how many more savory biscuits he ate than sweet ones, we need to subtract the number of sweet biscuits he ate from the number of savory biscuits he ate. So, if we subtract 20 (the number of sweet biscuits) from 34 (the number of savory biscuits), we get:  
34 - 20 = 14 
So, Paco ate 14 more savory biscuits than sweet biscuits."
Response:  If Paco had 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 cookie left.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 36 cookies to start with. Then he gave 14 cookies to his friend, so now he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Next, we know that he ate 10 cookies, so now he has 22 - 10 = 12 cookies left. Therefore, there are 12 cookies remaining for Paco.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 41 cookies to start with. Then he gave 9 cookies to his friend, so now he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. Next, we know that he ate 18 cookies, so now he has 32 - 18 = 14 cookies left. Finally, we can see that he ate more cookies than he gave away (18 > 9), so the difference between the two is equal to the number of cookies he ate but did not give away: 18 - 9 = 9. Therefore, Paco ate 9 more cookies than he gave away to his friend.
"Response:  First, we know that Paco had 6 cookies and he gave 30 cookies to his friend. So, how many more cookies did he give to his friend than the ones he ate?  
To find out, let's subtract the number of cookies Paco ate (23) from the total number of cookies he gave to his friend (30):  
30 - 23 = 7  
So, Paco gave 7 more cookies to his friend than the ones he ate."
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 97 biscuits in total (97 = 34 + 63). He ate 15 of them (15 = 0 + 15), so he has 82 left (82 = 97 - 15). Now, we know that 34 of those remaining biscuits are sweet (34 = 0 + 34), and since Paco ate 15 of them, there are only 19 sweet biscuits left (19 = 34 - 15). Therefore, Paco has 82 - 19 = 63 plain biscuits left.
Response:  First, we know that Paco had 26 biscuits salés and 17 biscuits sucrés. That means he had a total of 26 + 17 = 43 biscuits. Next, we know that he ate 14 biscuits sucrés and 9 biscuits salés. So, how many biscuits are left? To find out, let's subtract the number of biscuits he ate from the total number of biscuits he had: 43 - (14 + 9) = 43 - 23 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 biscuits salés remaining for Paco.
"Response:  First, we know that Paco has eaten 23 biscuits salés and 32 biscuits sucrés. So let's start with the number of salty biscuits he ate:  
23 = x + 6 (since there were 6 salty biscuits to begin with) 
Now we can solve for ""x"" : 
x = 17 (Since 17 is the difference between 23 and 6) 
Now, let's find out how many sweet biscuits Paco ate more than salty ones: 
32 - 17 = 15 (Since 15 is the difference between 32 and 17) 
So, Paco ate 15 more sweet biscuits than salty ones."
"Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 28 salty biscuits and 15 sweet biscuits. To find out how many more salty biscuits he has eaten than sweet ones, we need to subtract the number of sweet biscuits from the number of salty biscuits. So, if we subtract 15 (the number of sweet biscuits) from 28 (the number of salty biscuits), we get:  
28 - 15 = 13 
So, Paco has eaten 13 more salty biscuits than sweet ones."
"Response:  We know that Gwen received $7 and she has $5 left. So we can subtract what she spent from what she received to find out how much she spent. Here's the calculation:
$7 - $5 = $2
So Gwen spent $2."
"Response:  We know that Gwen spent $8 and she has $6 left. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

$8 - $6 = $?

Solving for the missing amount, we get:

$8 - $6 = $2

Therefore, Gwen received $2 for her birthday."
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mom and $4 from her dad, so she has a total of $2 + $4 = $6. Then, we know that she spent $3, so she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, for a total of $13. She spent $4, so she has $13 - $4 = $9 left. To find out how much more money she got from her mom compared to her dad, we need to subtract what she spent ($4) from what her dad gave her ($5): $5 - $4 = $1. So, Gwen got $1 more from her mom than her dad.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad for a total of $9. She spent $4, so she has $9 - $4 = $5 left over. To find out how much more her dad gave her compared to her mom, we need to subtract what her mom gave her ($3) from what her dad gave her ($6): $6 - $3 = $3. So, her dad gave her $3 more than her mom did.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 more from her mother for a total of $12. She spent $4, so she has $12 - $4 = $8 left. To find out how much more she received from her mother compared to her father, we need to subtract what she received from her father ($5) from what she had left after spending ($8): $8 - $5 = $3. So, Gwen received $3 more from her mother than from her father.
"Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 more from her mother, so she received a total of $5 + $2 = $7. Since she spent $6, we can subtract $6 from $7 to find out how much more she received from her father than from her mother:

$7 - $6 = $1

So, Gwen received $1 more from her father than from her mother."
Response:  If Josh had 9 billes and now he has 4, then he must have lost 5 billes (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  If Josh had 12 billes left after losing 21, that means he lost 21 - 12 = 9 billes. So, Josh had 9 more billes in his collection before he lost them.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 19 billes in his collection to start with. Then he lost 11 of them, so now he has 19 - 11 = 8 billes left. But wait! He also found 5 new ones, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 billes in total.
"Response:  We know that Josh had 4 billes in his collection and he lost 16 billes. So, if we subtract the number of billes he lost from the total number of billes he had, we can find out how many more billes he has lost than the ones he found.  
4 (initial billes) - 16 (lost billes) =?
Solution: 4 - 16 = -12
So, Josh has lost 12 more billes than the 8 new billes he found."
"Response:  We know that Josh had 7 billes in his collection and he lost 8 of them. So, if we subtract 8 from 7, we get:  
7 - 8 =?  
That gives us:  
-1  
So, Josh has one fewer ball than he started with. But then it says he found 10 new balls. If we add 10 to -1, what do we get?  
10 + (-1) =?  
That gives us:  
9  
So, Josh found 9 more balls than he lost!"
Response:  If Josh had 21 marbles and found 7 more, then he has 21 + 7 = 28 marbles now.
Response:  If Josh had 20 billes and gave 2 to Jack, then he has 20 - 2 = 18 billes left. So, Josh has 18 billes now.
Response:  If Josh had 22 billes and Jack gave him 20 more, then Josh now has 22 + 20 = 42 billes in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 19 billes before and he lost 11 of them, then he has 19 - 11 = 8 billes left now.
Response:  If Josh had 22 billes and found 13, then he has 22 - 13 = 9 left. But if he lost 5, then he only has 9 - 5 = 4 billes left. So, Josh now has 4 billes in his collection.
Response:  We know that Josh had 15 billes in his collection and he found 9 more. So, if we add 15 + 9 = 24 billes. Now, we are told that he lost 23 billes. If we subtract 24 - 23 = 1 bille. Therefore, Josh has lost one more bille than the ones he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 3 billes to start with and he found 6 more. So, in total, he has 3 + 6 = 9 billes. But then we are told that he lost 5 of them. Therefore, the number of billes he has left is 9 - 5 = 4. So, Josh found 4 more billes than he lost.
Response:  We know that together they picked 4 pounds of strawberries and Marco alone picked 19 pounds. So we can say that his father picked (4 - 19) = 15 pounds less than Marco. Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 19 + 15 = 34 pounds more than his father's.
"Response:  We know that together they picked 35 pounds of strawberries and Marco alone picked 13 pounds. So we can start by subtracting what Marco picked from the total amount they picked to find out how much his father picked.  

35 - 13 = 22 pounds

So, Marco's father picked 22 pounds more than Marco did."
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father picked 20 pounds of strawberries. The strawberries that his father picked weighed 17 pounds. So, the strawberries that Marco picked must have weighed 3 pounds (20 - 17 = 3).
"Response:  We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 8 pounds and his father's strawberries weighed 32 pounds. To find out how much their strawberries together, we need to add these two amounts. So, if we add 8 + 32, we get... (drumroll)...40 pounds! That's right; their strawberries together weighed 40 pounds."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. If Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, then he had 15 pounds (24 - 9) left. Since Marco has only 3 pounds of strawberries left, we can deduce that his father had 12 pounds (15 - 3) of strawberries.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father collected 36 pounds of strawberries. If we subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries (which weigh 12 pounds), we get the weight of his father's strawberries: 36 - 12 = 24 pounds. So, Marco's father's strawberries now weigh 24 pounds.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 22 pounds of strawberries. If we add the additional 30 pounds found by Marco's father on the way back, the total amount of strawberries they have is:

22 + 30 = 52 pounds

So, now Marco's father has 52 pounds of strawberries."
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 37 pounds of strawberries. If we subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries (15 pounds) from the total weight, we can find out how much his father's strawberries weighed.  

37 - 15 = 22 pounds

So, Marco's father's strawberries weighed 22 pounds."
"Response:  We know that together they picked 17 pounds of strawberries and Marco alone picked 30 pounds. So we can start by subtracting what his father picked from what he picked to find out how much more he picked:  

30 - 17 = 13 
So Marco picked 13 pounds more than his father did."
"Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father picked 26 pounds of strawberries. If Marco alone picked 10 pounds of strawberries, then his father must have picked an additional amount to make up for the remaining weight difference. To find out how much more his father picked, we can subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of both their pickings. In this case, we would subtract 10 pounds from 26 pounds, which gives us:  

26 pounds - 10 pounds = 16 pounds 
So, Marco's father picked 16 pounds of strawberries more than Marco did."
"Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father picked 30 pounds of strawberries. If we subtract the weight of his father's strawberries (11 pounds), we can determine how much Marco picked. So...

30 - 11 = 19 pounds

Therefore, Marco picked 19 pounds of strawberries."
Response:  We know that there were two children in the bus initially (before the stop). Then, more children got on the bus after the stop (we don't know exactly how many yet). So, to find out how many more children are in the bus now compared to before the stop, we need to subtract the number of children who were already in the bus from the total number of children currently in the bus. Total number of children currently in the bus = 10 (given) - 2 (initial number of children) = 8. Therefore, there are 8 more children in the bus now compared to before the stop.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 26 children in the bus and then 38 more got on board at the next stop. So we can calculate as follows:

26 + 38 = 64

Therefore, there are now 64 children in the bus."
"Response:  We know that there were 41 children in total in the bus after the stop. If we subtract the number of children who were already in the bus before the stop from the total number of children, we can find out how many children were getting on the bus at the stop. So let's do this:

41 (total) - 2 (children who got on at the stop) = 39

So, 39 children were getting on the bus at the stop."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 43 children in the bus and after some of them got down at the bus stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. So we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of children who got down from the bus.
Then, the number of children remaining in the bus is:

21 = 43 - x

Now, we need to solve for x. To do so, we can add both sides of the equation with 0:

21 + 0 = 43 - x + 0

This simplifies to:

21 = 43 - x

Subtracting 43 from both sides gives us:

x = 22

So, 22 children got down from the bus at the bus stop."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 41 children in the bus and now there are 18 left after some of them got off at the stop. So we can subtract 18 from 41 to find out how many more children were in the bus before they got off:

41 - 18 = 23

Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus before they got off compared to the number of children remaining in the bus now (18)."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 21 children in the bus and then 10 children got off the bus at the stop. So, how many children are left? 
We can use subtraction to find out:
21 - 10 = 11
Therefore, there were 11 children left in the bus after 10 children got off. Now, we need to find out how many more children got onto the bus at the next stop. To do this, we subtract the number of children who started on the bus (11) from the total number of children at the next stop (16):
16 - 11 = 5
So, 5 children got onto the bus at the next stop."
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 children in the bus and then 63 more got off the bus. So, if we subtract 5 from 63, we get 58. This means that 58 more children got onto the bus than those who got off.
Response:  We know that there were initially 36 children in the bus and then 68 children got off the bus. So, if we subtract 36 from 68, we get 32. Now, we also know that there were 12 children left in the bus after everyone got off, so if we subtract 32 from 12, we get -20. This means that 20 more children got off the bus than those who got on.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 22 children in the bus and then 40 more got on the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children on the bus after everyone boarded is:

22 + 40 = 62

Now we are told that there are only 2 children left on the bus. Therefore, we can subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children to find out how many children got off the bus:

62 - 2 = 60

So, 60 children got off the bus at the stop."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 28 children in the bus and then 82 more got on the bus while some got off. So, if we subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who got on, we can find out how many more children are left.

Let X be the number of children who got off the bus. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:

28 + X = 82 (since 82 children got on the bus)

Now, we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:

X = 82 - 28

X = 54

So, 54 children more got on the bus than those who got off."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and then 24 children got on the bus at the next stop. So, if we add 23 + 24 = 47 children in total. Then, it says that there are only 8 children left in the bus after some of them have gotten off. Therefore, we can subtract 8 from 47 to find out how many more children got off than those who got on: 
47 - 8 = 39. 
So, 39 children got off the bus more than the number of children who got on (24)."
Response:  If the baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 cakes left (133 - 51 = 82). So, he has made more than 51 cakes because he still has 82 cakes left after selling 51. The difference between the number of cakes he made and the number of cakes he sold is 82 - 51 = 31. Therefore, the baker made 31 more cakes than he sold.
"Response:  If the baker has sold some of his cakes and is left with 13, we can start by subtracting the number he has sold from the total number he made to find out how many he has left. So if he made 54 cakes and sold x cakes, then he would have 54 - x cakes left. We are told that he has 13 cakes left, so we can set up an equation:

54 - x = 13

Now solve for x by adding x to both sides of the equation:

54 = 13 + x

Subtract 13 from both sides:

41 = x

So the baker has sold 41 cakes."
Response:  We know that the baker sold 145 gâteaux and has 72 left. To find out how many he made in total, we can subtract the number sold from the number left: 72 - 145 =.... Can you do this subtraction?
Response:  If the baker made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140 of them, then he has 155 - 140 = 15 cakes left.
Response:  We know that the baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them. So he has 16 cakes left (121 - 105 = 16). But then we are told that he bought 170 new cakes. So now he has 16 + 170 = 186 cakes in total.
"Response:  We know that the baker sold 91 cakes and bought 154 new ones. To find out how many more cakes he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of new cakes he bought. So...

91 - 154 =?

Do you want me to calculate this for you?"
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 78 cakes and bought 31 new ones. So if we subtract the number of cakes he bought from the total number of cakes he made, we get the difference between the two numbers.  
78 - 31 = 47
So the baker has sold 47 more cakes than he purchased."
Response:  We know that the baker made 110 gâteaux at first and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then he made 76 more cakes, so now he has 35 + 76 = 111 gâteaux in total.
Response:  We know that the baker made 144 gâteaux in total and sold 71 of them. So, he has 71 - 144 = 73 left (since we subtracted the number sold from the total). Now, he makes 111 more. Therefore, the total number of gâteaux the baker now has is 73 + 111 = 184. To find out how many more gâteaux the baker made compared to those he sold, we need to subtract the number sold from the new total: 184 - 71 = 113. The baker made 113 more gâteaux than the ones he sold.
Response:  If the boulanger sells 10 gâteaux and 90 pâtisseries, then he will have sold a total of 10 + 90 = 100 items. Since he made 149 gâteaux and 91 pâtisseries in total, he will still have 149 - 10 = 139 gâteaux left, and 91 - 90 = 1 pâtisserie left. So, the boulanger will have 139 gâteaux and 1 pâtisserie left after selling 100 items.
"Response:  We know that the baker made 7 cakes and 148 pastries in total. If he sells 15 cakes and 103 pastries, we can subtract those numbers from the original total to find out how many pastries are left. So...

7 (cakes) + 148 (pastries) = Total

If he sells:

15 (cakes) + 103 (pastries) = New Total

Now let's subtract the new total from the old total to find out how many pastries are left:

Total - New Total = Pastries Left

Can you do this subtraction and give me the answer?"
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries is 48 + 81 = 130. The number of cakes sold is 115. So we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the total number of pastries to find out how many more pastries were made than cakes:  
130 - 115 = 15. 
Therefore, the baker has made 15 more pastries than cakes."
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries is 131 + 88 = 219. The total number of cakes sold is 70. So we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of pastries to find out how many more pastries were made than cakes:  
219 - 70 = 149. 
Therefore, the boulanger has made 149 more pastries than cakes."
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes sold is equal to the sum of the number of cakes and pastries sold. So we can write an equation based on this information:  
Total = Cakes + Pastries 
We are given that the boulanger has sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows:  
Total = 158 + 147 
Now solve for Total. 
Total = 305 
So the total number of pastries and cakes sold is 305. Now we need to find out how many more cakes than pastries were sold. To do this, we can subtract the number of pastries from the total number of pastries and cakes sold:  
Cakes - Pastries = Total - Pastries 
Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:  
Cakes - Pastries = 305 - 147 
Simplifying, we obtain:  
Cakes - Pastries = 158 
Therefore, the boulanger has sold 158 more cakes than pastries."
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes sold is equal to the sum of the number of each type of pastry or cake sold. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Total = 54 (gâteaux) + 143 (pâtisseries)

We also know that the boulanger has sold 68 gâteaux and 92 pâtisseries. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our previous equation:

Total = 54 (gâteaux) + 143 (pâtisseries)
Total = 68 (gâteaux) + 92 (pâtisseries)

Now we solve for the difference between the number of pastries and the number of cakes sold:

Difference = Total - (68 (gâteaux))
Difference = Total - 54 (gâteaux)
Difference = 92 (pâtisseries)

Therefore, the boulanger has sold 92 pastries more than gâteaux."
Response:  If the baker sold 44 cakes and initially made 48 cakes, then he has (48 - 44) = 4 cakes left.
Response:  If the baker sold 8 cakes and initially made 40 cakes, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 cakes left. So, the baker has 32 additional cakes that he did not sell.
Response:  If the baker had initially made 169 cakes and his friend bought 137 of them, then he would still have 32 cakes left (169 - 137 = 32).
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 86 cakes and bought 103 new ones. So if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of new cakes he bought, we get:  
103 - 86 = 17  
So the baker still has 17 cakes left."
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 89 cakes and bought 167 new ones. So if we subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of new cakes he bought, we get:  
167 - 89 = 78. 
Therefore, the baker has purchased 78 more cakes than he has sold."
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 145 gâteaux and has bought 139 new ones. So we can start by subtracting the number of gâteaux he has bought from the number of gâteaux he has sold:  
145 - 139 =? 
Now let's simplify our calculation:  
145 - 139 = 6 
So the baker has sold 6 more gâteaux than he has bought."
Response:  We know that the baker made 62 cakes at first and then he made 149 more. So in total, he has made 62 + 149 = 211 cakes. But we are also told that he sold 144 of them. Therefore, the number of cakes the baker still has is 211 - 144 = 67.
Response:  We know that the baker made 81 gâteaux at first and then he made 92 more. So in total, he has made 81 + 92 = 173 gâteaux. Now we are told that he sold 46 of them. To find out how many more gâteaux the baker made than what he sold, we need to subtract the number of gâteaux sold from the total number of gâteaux made. Therefore, we can say that the baker made 173 - 46 = 127 more gâteaux than what he sold.
"Response:  We know that the baker has made 61 pâtisseries and 167 gâteaux in total. If he sells 108 gâteaux and 44 pâtisseries, we can subtract the number of items sold from the total to find out how many are left.  
So, for the gâteaux:
167 - 108 = 59
The baker will have 59 gâteaux left.
For the pâtisseries:
61 - 44 = 17
The baker will have 17 pâtisseries left."
"Response:  We know that the baker made 56 pastries and 124 cakes. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 pastries, we can subtract the number of items he sold from the total number of items he made to find out how many items are left over.  
So, if he sold 104 cakes, then he has 124 - 104 = 20 cakes left over.  
Similarly, if he sold 29 pastries, then he has 56 - 29 = 27 pastries left over.  
Therefore, the baker will have 20 cakes and 27 pastries left over in total."
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes is 52 + 84 = 136. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries, we can subtract the number of items sold from the total to find out how many were not sold.  
136 - 102 = 34 (pastries)
136 - 94 = 42 (cakes)
So there are 34 more pastries than cakes."
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes is 134 + 11 = 145. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries, then we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
140 + 92 = 145  
Now let's solve for the difference between the number of pastries and the number of cakes:  
Subtracting 140 from both sides gives us:  
92 - 140 = 145 - 140  
This simplifies to:  
-48 = 45  
Which means there are 45 more pastries than cakes."
Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes sold is 8 + 97 = 105. Since there are 153 pastries in total, we can see that the boulanger has sold 153 - 8 = 145 pastries. Now, let's compare the number of cakes to the number of pastries. The boulanger has sold 97 cakes and 145 pastries, so he has sold 97 / 145 = 67% more cakes than pastries.
"Response:  We know that the total number of pastries and cakes sold is 154 + 78 = 232. The number of pastries sold is 114, so the difference between the number of pastries and cakes sold is:  
232 - 114 = 118. Therefore, the boulanger has sold 118 more pastries than cakes."
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 games and she wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, we can set up an equation as follows:

Let X be the number of games Kelly buys.

We know that she starts with 22 games (K), so K = 22.

She wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, so we can say that:

K + X = 140

Now we need to solve for X. To do this, we can subtract K from both sides of the equation:

K + X = 140
K + X - K = 140 - K
X = 140 - K

So if Kelly has 22 games and wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, she should buy:

X = 140 - 22 = 118 games.

Therefore, Kelly needs to buy 118 games to have 140 games left after purchasing some more."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 games and gives 64 games away, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 games left.
Response:  If Kelly had 91 games initially and she still has 92 games now, then she must have bought or received one more game during this time period. So, her initial number of games was 91, and she gained one more game to reach 92 games in total. Therefore, the answer is 91 + 1 = 92.
"Response:  If Kelly has 20 games for Nintendo and wants to have 12 left after giving some away, we can start by subtracting 12 from 20.  
20 - 12 = 8 So, Kelly needs to give away 8 games."
"Response:  If Kelly has 46 games for Nintendo and she wants to have 31 games left after giving some of her Sony games away, we can start by subtracting the number of Nintendo games from the total number of games she owns:  
Total Games = Number of Nintendo Games + Number of Sony Games 
Total Games = 46 (Nintendo) + x (Sony) 
We know that she wants to be left with 31 games, so we can set up an equation based on this information: 
31 = Total Games - 46 
Now solve for ""x"" (the number of Sony games): 
x = Total Games - 31 
x = 46 + 31 
x = 77 
So, Kelly needs to give away 77 Sony games in order to have 31 games left."
Response:  If Kelly has 80 games and found 31 more, she now has 80 + 31 = 111 games in total. To have only 6 games left, she must give away 111 - 6 = 105 games.
"Response:  We know that Randy used 52 blocks to build a tower and he has 38 blocks left. So we can start with this equation:

52 - 38 = x

Where x is the number of blocks Randy had at first. To solve for x, we add 38 to both sides of the equation:

52 - 38 + 38 = x + 38

This simplifies to:

14 = x

So Randy had 14 blocks at first."
"Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks in total and he uses some of them to build a tower. If he is left with 72 blocks, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from 97 to find out how many blocks were used. So, let x be the number of blocks used for the tower.  
We know that x + 72 = 97 (since he has 72 blocks left)  
Subtracting both sides gives us:  
x + 72 - 97 = 0  
x = 25 (Since 25 is the only solution to the above equation)  
Therefore, Randy has used 25 blocks to build his tower."
"Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total and he used 25 blocks to build a tower (14 blocks) and a house (11 blocks). So we can calculate how many blocks are left as follows:  
79 - 14 = 65  
65 - 11 = 54  
Therefore, Randy has 54 blocks left."
"Response:  We know that Randy used 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. To find out how many blocks he has used in total, we need to add these two numbers together. So, if we add 27 + 53, we get:  
27 + 53 = 80 
Therefore, Randy has used 80 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. To find out how many additional blocks he used for the tower compared to the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower.  
So, if we subtract 13 (the number of blocks used for the house) from 33 (the number of blocks used for the tower), we get:  
33 - 13 = 20  
Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. To find out how many extra blocks he used for the house compared to the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, if we subtract 79 from 82, we get:  
82 - 79 = 3 
So, Randy used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
Response:  If Randy used 36 blocks to build a tower, that means he has 59 - 36 = 23 blocks left.
"Response:  We know that Randy used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. To find out how many additional blocks he used for the tower compared to the house, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the number of blocks used for the tower.  
So, if Randy used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower, then he used:  
50 - 20 = 30 additional blocks to build the tower compared to the house."
"Response:  We know that Randy used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower. To find out how many more blocks he used for the house compared to the tower, we need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, let's do that:  
89 - 63 = 26  
Therefore, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower."
Response:  If there are 20 books in total and I have already read 5 of them, then I have not yet read 15 books (20 - 5 = 15).
"Response:  If I have read 13 books out of x (where x is the total number of books in the series), then I have 8 books left to read. This means that there are 8 + 13 = 21 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 books in total and we have already read 12 of them. So, how many books do we still need to read?  
To find out, we can subtract the number of books we have read (12) from the total number of books (22):

22 - 12 = 10

So, we still need to read 10 more books!"
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films in total and you have already watched 7 of them. To find out how many films you have left to watch, we can subtract the number of films you have already watched from the total number of films. So, if we do this, we get:  
17 - 7 = 10
Therefore, you have 10 films left to watch."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in total. If we read 19 books, then we have read all of them because there are only 16 books. So, the number of books we have read is equal to the total number of books, which is 16. Now let's look at the number of films we have watched. We have watched 13 films, so we still need to watch 1 more film to watch all of them. Therefore, the difference between the number of books and the number of films is 1 book less than the number of films, which is 15 - 1 = 14. So, there are 14 books more than films in the series Crazy Silly School."""
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in total. If we have read 19 of the books (which is less than half), then how many more books do we need to read? To find out, let's subtract the number of books we have read from the total number of books:  
Total number of books - Books read = Number of books left to read  
8 - 19 = 7  
Therefore, we still need to read 7 books. Now, let's look at the number of films we have watched. We have seen 61 films, which is much more than half of the total number of films:  
Total number of films - Films watched = Number of films left to watch  
10 - 61 = -41  
Oops! It looks like we have already watched all the films! So, there are no more films left to watch. However, we can see that there are still some books left to read. Therefore, the difference between the number of films and the number of books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"" is:  
Number of books left to read - Number of films watched = 7 - (-41) = 48  
So, there are 48 more books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"" than films."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in total. If we have read 13 books, then we have read 3 more than the number of films (13 - 11 = 3). So, we have read 3 more books than films.
Response:  If I have read 7 books and watched 21 films, then I have consumed a total of 7 + 21 = 28 pieces of media. Since there are 11 books and 17 films in the series, this means that I have consumed all but 4 books (11 - 7) and all but 6 films (17 - 21). Therefore, I have consumed more films than books. Specifically, I have consumed 21 - 7 = 14 more films than books.
Response:  If there are 14 books in the series and I have read 8 of them, then I still have 6 books left to read (14 - 8 = 6).
"Response:  We know that there are 19 books in total and you have already read 4 of them. So, we can subtract 4 from 19 to find out how many books you still need to read.  
19 - 4 = 15
Therefore, you have 15 books left to read."
Response:  We know that there are 8 films in total and we have already watched 4 of them. So, we still have to watch 8 - 4 = 4 more films.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 books in total and we have read 11 of them. So, there are 15 - 11 = 4 more books to be read. Similarly, there are 14 films in total and we have watched 40 of them. So, there are 14 - 40 = -26 films left to watch. Since we cannot have a negative number of films, let's round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there is 1 book more than films in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 films and 11 books in total. If we have read 13 of the books (which is less than half), then how many more books are left to be read?  
Let's use subtraction here!
11 - 13 =?
The difference between the number of books left to be read and the number of books already read is...
11 - 13 = 8
So, there are 8 more books left to be read. Now, let's talk about the films. How many films have we watched so far?
63 -? =?
We want to find out how many films are left to be watched.
63 - x =?
Now, we can substitute the value of x (the number of films left to be watched) based on our previous calculation.
63 - 8 =?
Substituting x with 8 gives us...
63 - 8 = 55
Therefore, there are 55 more films left to be watched compared to the number of books left to be read."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in total. If we have watched 19 films and read 14 books, then we can start by comparing these numbers to each other.  
We have watched more films (19) than we have read books (14). So, the difference between the number of films we have watched and the number of books we have read is:  
19 - 14 = 5  
Therefore, we have read 5 fewer books than we have watched films."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in total. If we have read/watched 19 things, it means we have either read or watched all of them (since there is no other option). So let's count how many books and films we have done each. 
We have read 19 books, so we have read all 8 books. 
We have also watched 19 films, so we have watched all 5 films. 
Now, since we have done both an equal number of books and films, we can say that we have done neither more books nor more films than the others. In other words, we have done the same amount of books and films."
Response:  If Dave has won 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then the number of tickets he has left is equal to the number of tickets he used to buy toys. So if Dave has 2 tickets left, he must have used 5 tickets (7 - 2 = 5) to buy toys.
Response:  We know that Dave has used 12 tickets to buy toys and he still has 14 tickets left. So we can say that Dave has won 14 - 12 = 2 more tickets at the amusement park.
Response:  If Dave had 18 tickets and used 5 to buy toys, he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left. Then, if he spent 11 more tickets on clothes, he would have 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
"Response:  We know that Dave has used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 more to buy clothes. So in total, he has used 12 + 7 = 19 tickets. Now we need to find out how many tickets he has used for buying toys compared to buying clothes. To do this, we can subtract the number of tickets he has used for buying clothes from the total number of tickets he has used. So, if we subtract 7 from 19, we get:  
19 - 7 = 12 
So Dave has used 12 tickets more for buying toys than for buying clothes."
"Response:  We know that Dave has used 8 tickets to buy toys and 18 more to buy clothes. To find out how many more tickets he used for clothes than for toys, we need to subtract the number of tickets he used for toys from the total number of tickets he used. So, if we let T be the total number of tickets Dave used, we can write an equation like this:
T = 8 + 18
T = 26
Now, we know that Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys, so we can say that he used 26 - 8 = 18 more tickets to buy clothes. Therefore, the answer is 18."
Response:  If Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2, then he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he used 10 of them to buy toys, then he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. So, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  We know that 9 trees have died after the typhoon and 14 trees were planted in total. So we can say that 5 trees (14 - 9 = 5) have survived the typhoon. Therefore, there are 5 more dead trees than surviving trees.
"Response:  We know that 13 trees were planted in total and after the typhoon, 6 of them died. So we can start with this information:

13 - 6 = 7

There are 7 trees left alive after the typhoon. Now, we need to find out how many more trees have survived than those that died. To do this, we subtract the number of dead trees (6) from the total number of trees planted (13):

13 - 6 = 7

So, 7 trees have survived more than those that died."
Response:  If Haley planted 20 trees in her garden and after the typhoon only 4 trees are left, then we can deduce that 16 trees have died during the typhoon (20 - 4 = 16).
"Response:  If there were initially x trees in total and y died after the typhoon, then we can write an equation to represent this information as follows:

x - y = 12 (since only 12 trees survived)

Now, we know that x is equal to the number of trees Haley planted before the typhoon hit. So we can solve for x using the above equation:

x = 12 + y

Given that y = 5 (the number of trees that died), we have:

x = 12 + 5

x = 17

Therefore, Haley planted 17 trees in her garden before the typhoon hit."
Response:  First, we know that Haley had 9 trees in her garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, she lost 4 trees, so now she has 9 - 4 = 5 trees left. Then, she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total.
Response:  If 2 trees died after the typhoon, then there are 12 - 2 = 10 trees left in Haley's garden.
"Response:  If there were initially 3 trees in the garden and after the storm, 13 trees died, then we can subtract 3 from 13 to find out how many more trees died during the storm compared to those that survived. So, if we do this subtraction, we get:  
13 - 3 = 10 
So, 10 trees more died during the storm than survived."
Response:  If 2 trees have died after the typhoon, then there are 11 - 2 = 9 trees left in the garden. So, all 9 trees have survived more than those that have died.
Response:  If each sac contains 28 oranges and they collect 66 sacs per day, then they collect 66 x 28 = 1848 oranges per day.
"Response:  If they currently collect 8 sacs per day and we want to collect 24 sacs in total, then we need to know how many days it will take to collect 24 sacs if they continue to collect at the same rate of 8 sacs per day. To find out, we can divide the total number of sacs we want to collect (24) by the number of sacs they collect per day (8): 

24 / 8 = 3
So, it will take 3 days to collect 24 sacs of oranges if they continue to collect at the same rate of 8 sacs per day."
Response:  We know that there are 4 days of harvesting and they have collected a total of 56 bags of oranges. So, if we divide 56 by 4, we get an average of 14 bags per day.
"Response:  We know that they currently collect 38 sacs per day and each sack contains 42 oranges. To find out how many sacs they will have after 49 days of harvesting, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of sacs collected per day. So, if we multiply 49 days by 38 sacs per day, we get:  
49 x 38 = 1764 sacs 
Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have 1764 sacs of oranges."
Response:  We know that they harvest 66 bags per day and each bag contains 25 oranges. So in one day, they collect 66 x 25 = 1650 oranges. After 87 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1650 x 87 = 143,950 oranges.
"Response:  We know that each bag contains 35 oranges and they collect 8 bags per day. So we can calculate how many oranges they collect in total:

8 bags x 35 oranges/bag = 280 oranges/day"
Response:  We know that each day they collect 16 sacks of oranges and each sack contains 57 oranges. So if we want to collect 80 sacks of oranges, we need to collect 80 x 57 = 4560 oranges in total. Since they collect 16 sacks per day, it will take them 4560 / 16 = 283 days to collect 80 sacks of oranges.
"Response:  We know that each sac contains 12 oranges and they collect 67 sacs per day. So if they collect 35 sacs, we can calculate how many oranges they will have collected as follows:  
35 x 12 = 420 oranges."
Response:  We know that they harvest 74 bags per day and throw away 71 bags. So in one day, they have 3 bags left over (74 - 71 = 3). Now we need to find out how many bags of oranges they will have after 51 days. Can you do that math for me? Sure! If they have 3 bags left over each day, then after 51 days, they will have 3 x 51 = 153 bags of oranges left over.
"Response:  We know that they harvest 76 sacks per day and each sack contains 50 oranges. So we can calculate how many oranges they collect in total as follows:

76 sacks x 50 oranges/sack = 3800 oranges/day

Therefore, they collect 3800 oranges per day."
"Response:  We know that they harvest 28 sacs of ripe oranges and 52 sacs of unripe oranges per day. To find out how many sacs they will have after 26 days, we need to multiply the number of days by the total number of sacs harvested per day. So, if we multiply 26 days by 70 sacs (28 + 52), we get:

26 days x 70 sacs = 1900 sacs

Therefore, after 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1900 sacs of oranges in total."
"Response:  We know that they harvest 82 sacs of ripe oranges and 61 sacs of unripe oranges per day. To find out how many sacs of ripe oranges they will have after 25 days, we need to multiply the number of sacs they harvest per day by the number of days they will be harvesting. So, if they harvest 82 + 61 = 143 sacs per day, and they will be harvesting for 25 days, then they will have:

143 x 25 = 3575 sacs of ripe oranges after 25 days."
"Response:  If they harvest 31 sacs of ripe oranges and 24 sacs of unripe oranges per day, then in total, they harvest 55 sacs of oranges per day (31 + 24). Since there are 45 days of harvesting, they will have collected a total of 55 x 45 = 2475 sacs of oranges over the entire period.  
Of these, 31 sacs per day are ripe, so they will have collected 31 x 45 = 1495 sacs of ripe oranges. The remaining 24 sacs per day are unripe, so they will have collected 24 x 45 = 1080 sacs of unripe oranges. Therefore, after 45 days of harvesting, they will have 1495 + 1080 = 2575 sacs of oranges in total, including both ripe and unripe ones."
Response:  We know that they collect 44 sacs of ripe oranges and 25 sacs of unripe oranges per day. To find out how many more ripe oranges are collected than unripe ones, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges. So, if we subtract 25 from 44, we get... (drumroll please)... 19! That means they collect 19 more sacs of ripe oranges than unripe ones per day.
"Response:  We know that they collect 5 sacs of ripe oranges and 74 sacs of unripe oranges per day. To find out how many more bags of unripe oranges are collected than ripe ones, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges from the total number of unripe oranges. So, if we subtract 5 from 74, we get:

74 - 5 = 69

Therefore, 69 more bags of unripe oranges are collected each day than ripe ones."
"Response:  We know that they collected 54 bags of oranges in total and each day they collect 18 bags. So we can calculate how many days it took to collect all the oranges as follows:

Total number of oranges = 54 bags x 20 oranges per bag = 1080 oranges

Number of days = Total number of oranges / Daily collection
= 1080 oranges / 18 bags/day
= 60 days

Therefore, it took 60 days to collect all the oranges if they collected 18 bags per day."
"Response:  We know that they have harvested 56 sacs of oranges in total and we also know that they have done it for 14 days. So if we divide the total number of sacs by the number of days, we will get the daily average. 
Daily Average = Total Number of Sacs / Number of Days 
= 56 / 14 
= 4 per day
Therefore, they have harvested 4 sacs of oranges per day for 14 days."
"Response:  We know that they harvest 5 sacs of mature oranges per day and 25 sacs of unripe oranges per day. So in total, they harvest 5 + 25 = 30 sacs of oranges per day. To find out how many sacs of mature oranges they will have after 73 days, we can multiply the number of days by the number of sacs harvested per day:  
30 x 73 = 2190 sacs of mature oranges After 73 days, they will have 2190 sacs of mature oranges."
Response:  If they collect 65 sacs of unripe oranges and 46 sacs of ripe oranges per day, then in total, they collect 65 + 46 = 111 sacs of oranges per day. To find out how many sacs of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days of harvesting, we can multiply the number of sacs collected per day by 6: 111 x 6 = 666 sacs of unripe oranges. So, after 6 days of harvesting, they will have 666 sacs of unripe oranges.
"Response:  We know that they collect 41 sacs of unripe oranges and 86 sacs of ripe oranges per day. To find out how many more ripe oranges are collected than unripe ones, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges. So, if we subtract 41 from 86, we get:

86 - 41 = 45

So, they collect 45 more sacs of ripe oranges than unripe ones per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 71 sacs of unripe oranges and 60 sacs of ripe oranges per day. To find out how many more sacs of unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges from the number of unripe oranges. So, if we subtract 60 from 71, we get:

71 - 60 = 11

Therefore, 11 more sacs of unripe oranges are collected per day than ripe oranges."
"Response:  We know that the length of the room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer it is than wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So... 
12 - 11 =...? 
That gives us... 
12 - 11 = 1 foot. 
So the room is one foot longer than it is wide."
"Response:  We know that the length of Jesse's room is 7 feet, and we need to find out its width so that we can determine if a 14-foot square rug will fit in it. To do this, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle (which is what Jesse's room is) is equal to the product of its length and width. So, let's call the width of Jesse's room ""w"" feet. Then, we can write an equation based on our information:  
Area = Length x Width 
Area = 7 x w 
Now, we are given that the rug needs to be 14 feet square, which means its area is also 14^2 = 196 square feet. Since the area of Jesse's room must be less than or equal to the area of the rug, we can set up another equation:  
196 = 7xw 
Now, solve for ""w"": 
w = 196 / 7 
w = 28 feet 
So, the width of Jesse's room is approximately 28 feet."
Response:  We know that the width of Jesse's room is 7 feet, and we need to find out how long her room is in order to determine the size of the rug she needs. To do this, we can use the formula for perimeter, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Since we are given that the width of the room is 7 feet, we can substitute that value into the formula as follows: P = 2(l + 7). Now we just need to figure out what the length of the room is. Can you solve for l using the information provided?
"Response:  We know that the room measures 11 feet in length and 15 feet in width, which means it has an area of 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since she already has 16 square feet of carpeting, we need to find out how much more carpeting she needs to cover the entire floor. To do this, subtract the amount of carpeting she already has from the total area of the room:  
165 - 16 = 149 square feet. So, she needs 149 square feet of additional carpeting to cover the entire floor."
Response:  We know that we have to cover an area of 2 x 12 = 24 square feet with 4 square foot tiles. So we need 24 / 4 = 6 tiles in total.
Response:  We know that each chamber has an area of $19 \times 18 = 352$ square feet. Since there are 20 chambers in total, we need to cover an area of $352 \times 20 = 6,040$ square feet with carpet. So, we need $6,040 / 9 = 672$ yards of carpet.
"Response:  We know that the length of the room is 20 feet and its width is 19 feet. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So...

20 - 19 =...?

That gives us...

20 - 19 = 1 foot

So the room is one foot longer than it is wide."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her bedroom floor. If her bedroom measures 5 feet in length, then we can find out the width of her bedroom by using the formula for area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since Jesse's bedroom is 5 feet long and she needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size, we can set up an equation as follows:  
Width = (Area / Length) = (10 / 5) = 2 feet 
Therefore, Jesse's bedroom measures 5 feet in length and 2 feet in width."
"Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 10 feet square (10 x 10 = 100 square feet). Since his room has a width of 2 feet, we can find out the length of the room as follows: 

Length = 100 / 2 = 50 feet

So, Jesse's room measures 50 feet in length and 2 feet in width."
"Response:  We know that Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet and his room measures 4 feet in length and 20 feet in width. To find out how much more carpet he needs to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of his room first. 
The formula for finding the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where A is the area and L and W are the lengths and widths respectively. In this case, the length (L) is 4 feet and the width (W) is 20 feet. So, the area of Jesse's room is:
A = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet
Now, we subtract the area of the room from the total amount of carpet available to find out how much extra carpet Jesse needs:
80 - 18 = 62 square feet
Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money they gained was $230. And we also know that each t-shirt sold brought in $23. So if we divide $230 by $23, we get...  
(230 / 23) = 10.
So they sold 10 t-shirts!"
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned is $51 and we sold 3 t-shirts. So if we divide $51 by 3, we get the price of each t-shirt as follows : 
$51 / 3 = $17 "
"Response:  We know that they sold 95 t-shirts in total during both matches. They sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas match, so they sold 95 - 47 = 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech match. Since each t-shirt costs $87, we can calculate how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech match as follows:  
48 x $87 = $3,964. Therefore, they gained $3,964 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech match."
"Response:  We know that they sold 242 t-shirts in total and 115 of them were during the Arkansas game. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:  

Total T-Shirts Sold = T-Shirts Sold During Arkansas Game + T-Shirts Sold During Texas Tech Game 

We also know that the profit from each t-shirt is $106. Therefore, we can calculate the total profit as follows: 

Total Profit = Total T-Shirts Sold x Price per T-Shirt 

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (T-Shirts Sold During Arkansas Game and T-Shirts Sold During Texas Tech Game). Can you use these equations to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game?"
"Response:  We know that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and each t-shirt costs $98. So if we multiply 89 by $98, we get:  
89 x $98 = $8,722  
So, they made $8,722 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game."
"Response:  We know that they sold 186 t-shirts in total during both matches. They sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas match, so they sold 186 - 172 = 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech match. Since each t-shirt costs $78, we can calculate how much money they made selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech match as follows:  
14 x $78 = $1,092  
Therefore, they made $1,092 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech match."
"Response:  We know that they gained $62 per t-shirt and $99 per jersey. So if we multiply $62 by 183 (the number of t-shirts sold), we get:

$62 x 183 = $11,466

And if we multiply $99 by 31 (the number of jerseys sold), we get:

$99 x 31 = $3,099

So in total, they have made:

$11,466 + $3,099 = $14,565"
"Response:  We know that they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 maillots during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. The profit from each t-shirt is $67, so the total profit from selling t-shirts is:  

$67 x 74 = $5,088

The profit from each maillot is $165, so the total profit from selling maillots is:  

$165 x 156 = $25,940

Therefore, the total amount of money earned by Razorback Boutique during the game is:  

$5,088 + $25,940 = $31,028"
"Response:  We know that the cost of each T-shirt is $192 and the cost of each jersey (maillot) is $34. So if we want to find out how much one T-shirt costs more than one jersey, we need to subtract the cost of the jersey from the cost of the T-shirt.

$192 - $34 = $158

So, one T-shirt costs $158 more than one jersey."
Response:  We know that the difference between the cost of a T-shirt and a jersey is $232 - $86 = $146. To find out how much one jersey costs more than one T-shirt, we can subtract the price of one T-shirt from the price of one jersey: $232 - $86 = $146. Therefore, one jersey costs $146 more than one T-shirt.
"Response:  First, we know that each t-shirt costs $51 before any discounts. If they offered an 8 dollar discount per shirt, then how much did they sell each shirt for? We can calculate this by subtracting the amount of the discount from the original price:  
$51 - $8 = $43 
So, if they sold 130 t-shirts during the game, they would have earned:  
130 x $43 = $5,690 
Therefore, the total amount of money they earned selling t-shirts during the game was $5,690."
"Response:  First, we know that they sold 14 t-shirts at $217 each, so we can calculate how much money they made from selling those shirts:  
14 x $217 = $3,098  
So, they made $3,098 from selling the t-shirts during the game."
"Response:  If they sold x t-shirts and each one costs $10, then their total revenue is 10x. We know that their total revenue was $60, so we can set up an equation:  
10x = 60 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 6 
So, they sold 6 t-shirts."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts is $215 and we also know that they sold 5 t-shirts. So if we divide $215 by 5, we get the price of each t-shirt as follows : 
$215 / 5 = $43 per t-shirt."
Response:  We know that they gained $5 per each jersey and $215 per each T-shirt. So if we multiply $5 by 64 (the number of jerseys sold), we get $320. If we multiply $215 by 20 (the number of T-shirts sold), we get $4,300. In total, they have earned $4,300 + $320 = $4,620 during the match between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  We know that they gained $76 per each jersey and $204 per each T-shirt. So if we multiply $76 by 2 (since there are two jerseys), we get $152. If we multiply $204 by 158 (since there are 158 T-shirts), we get $32,992. Therefore, the total amount of money they gained from selling both jerseys and T-shirts is $32,992 + $152 = $33,144.
"Response:  We know that the difference between the cost of a T-shirt and a jersey is $240 - $210 = $30. Since they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 jerseys, we can calculate how much each item costs by dividing the total revenue by the number of items sold:

T-shirts: 177 x $210 = $38,570 / 177 = $219.64 per shirt
Jerseys: 23 x $240 = $5,220 / 23 = $226.09 per jersey

So, a T-shirt costs $219.64, which is $226.09 minus $30."
"Response:  We know that the difference between the price of a T-shirt and a jersey is $115 - $25 = $90. To find out how much one jersey costs more than one T-shirt, we need to subtract the cost of one T-shirt from the cost of one jersey. So, if we sell x T-shirts and y jerseys, the total revenue from T-shirts will be 25x, and the total revenue from jerseys will be 115y. Since they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 jerseys during the game, we can substitute these numbers into our equation:  
25x + 115y =?... (1)
We also know that the total revenue was $1150. Therefore, we can set up another equation:
1150 = 25x + 115y... (2)
Now solve for x in equation (1):
25x = 1150 - 115y
Substituting y = 78, we get:
25x = 1150 - 115(78)
25x = 1150 - 9140
25x = -8640
Dividing both sides by 25 gives us:
x = -8640/25
x = -345
So, there were 345 T-shirts sold. Now, let's find out how many jerseys were sold:
115y = 1150 - 345(25)
115y = 1150 - 8625
115y = -7475
Dividing both sides by 115 gives us:
y = -7475/115
y = 65
Therefore, there were 65 jerseys sold. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the cost of one jersey and one T-shirt:
Cost of one jersey - Cost of one T-shirt"
Response:  If there are 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. Since they have decided to organize the party in their garden, we can assume that the number of tables is equal to the number of chairs. Therefore, if there are 50 chairs, there must be 50 tables as well. So, there are no more chairs than tables. The correct answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that there are two sets of tables with the same number of chairs. So if one set has x chairs, the other set also has x chairs. In total, there are 2x chairs in both sets. Since there are 12 chairs in the jardin, we can set up the equation:  
2x = 12 
Solving for x, we get: 
x = 6 
So each table has 6 chairs."
"Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in total and each set of tables has 3 chairs. So we can start by dividing 9 by 3 to find out how many sets of tables they have.

9 / 3 =?

Can you solve for x?"
"Response:  If they have 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs, then we can calculate how many chairs they have in total as follows :  
11 x 13 = 143 chairs."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs. So, if we multiply 10 x 6 = 60 chairs in total. Now, we know that there are 11 people sitting on these chairs, so we can subtract 11 from 60 to find out how many chairs remain unoccupied.  
60 - 11 = 49 chairs remain unoccupied."
Response:  They have 12 sets of tables with 14 chairs each = 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Plus they have 6 extra chairs = 6 + 168 = 174 chairs in total for their guests.
Response:  We know that each set of tables has 3 chairs, so if we have 4 sets of tables, we will need 4 x 3 = 12 chairs in total. Since 14 people will be attending the party, we will need an additional 14 - 12 = 2 chairs to accommodate all the guests. Therefore, they must buy 2 more chairs.
Response:  If they have 14 chairs for each set of tables and they have 9 sets of tables, then they will need 14 x 9 = 126 chairs in total. Since there are 13 chairs per set of tables (14 - 1), they will have 126 / 13 = 9 extra chairs.
"Response:  We know that Si has earned a total of $460 during 5 weeks of harvesting. So we can calculate how much he earns per week as follows : Total amount earned / Number of weeks = Weekly earnings 
$460 / 5 = $92 per week 
Therefore, Si earns $92 per week."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, we can calculate how many weeks he worked based on this information. To do so, we need to divide the total amount he earned ($1216) by his weekly wage ($16): 
$1216 ÷ $16 = x (where x is the number of weeks he worked) 
We can simplify this calculation as follows: 
x = 1216 / 16 
x = 75 (since 75 × 16 = 1216) 
Therefore, Lewis worked for 75 weeks during the harvest season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, so he earns a total of:  

$$ 21 x 216 = 4596 $$

Now we know that he has to pay $702 in taxes, so we subtract this amount from his total earnings:  

$$ 4596 - 702 = 3894 $$

Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $3894 left after paying his taxes."
"Response:  If Si works for 223 weeks (or seasons), then he will work for 73 x 223 = 16499 weeks in total. So his weekly earnings would be:  
1357 x 16499 = 2208139 dollars."
"Response:  We know that Lewis works for 1091 weeks during the harvest season and earns $28 per week in regular wages. This means he earns $28 x 1091 = $31,568 in regular wages. 
Now, we are told that he also earns $939 per week for overtime hours worked. If he works overtime every week, then his total weekly earnings will be $31,568 + $939 = $40,507 per week. 
Since there are 52 weeks in a year (ignoring any holidays or time off), Lewis's annual income from working overtime would be $40,507 x 52 = $2,070,144 per year."
Response:  We know that Lewis earns $403 per week for 233 weeks, which is equal to $91,590 in total. However, he has to pay $49 per week for rent, so we need to subtract this amount from his total earnings. Therefore, Lewis's net income during the harvest season is $91,590 - $49 x 233 = $91,590 - $11,677 = $80,913.
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $368 per week during the harvest season, which lasts for 1359 weeks. If he has to pay $388 in rent each week, how much does he pay in rent during the harvest season?

To find out, we need to multiply the number of weeks he works by his weekly rent:

$388 x 1359 = $524,724

So, Lewis pays $524,724 in rent during the harvest season."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $491 each week for 1181 weeks (which is approximately 23 years). So he will have earned a total of:  
491 x 1181 = $557,011  
However, we also know that he has to pay $216 per week in rent, so he will have paid:  
216 x 1181 = $253,264  
Therefore, at the end of the season, Lewis will have $557,011 - $253,264 = $303,747 left over."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $133 in total for 19 weeks of harvesting. So we can calculate how much he earns per week as follows : 
Total amount earned = $133 
Number of weeks = 19
To find out how much Lewis earns per week, we need to divide the total amount by the number of weeks : 
$133 / 19 = $7 $$7$$ is the amount Lewis earns each week for 19 weeks of harvesting."
"Response:  We know that Lewis earns $2 per week and we want to find out how many weeks he worked during the harvest season. To do this, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem.

Let x be the number of weeks Lewis worked during the harvest season. Since he earns $2 per week, his total earnings for the season are:

Total Earnings = Number of Weeks x Weekly Wage
= x x $2
= 2x

We know that Lewis earned a total of $178 during the harvest season. So, we can substitute this value into our equation:

2x = 178

Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 178 / 2
= 89

Therefore, Lewis worked for 89 weeks during the harvest season."
"Response:  We know that the depth of the water is 10 times the height of Dean, and we also know that Dean measures 9 feet tall. So if we set up an equation based on this information, we can solve for the difference in depth between the water and Dean's height. Here's the equation:

Depth of water = 10 x Height of Dean

Substituting Dean's height as 9 feet, we get:

Depth of water = 10 x 9
= 90 feet

So the difference in depth between the water and Dean's height is 90 - 9 = 81 feet."
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron measures 14 feet tall, then Dean measures 6 feet tall (14 - 8 = 6). The water is twice as deep as Dean, so the depth of the water is 2 x 6 = 12 feet.
Response:  We know that Ron measures 12 feet tall and Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean measures 12 - 11 = 1 foot tall. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height, so the depth of the water is 5 x 12 = 60 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so if Ron measures 13 feet, then Dean measures 13 + 4 = 17 feet tall. The depth of the water is 15 times the height of Dean, which means it is 15 x 17 = 255 feet deep.
"Response:  We know that Ron is 13 feet tall and Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. So, Dean is 13 + 9 = 22 feet tall. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height, so it would be:  
16 x 13 = 208 feet deep."
Response:  We know that Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron. So, Dean is 9 feet (15 - 6) tall. The water is 9 times deeper than Dean, so it is 9 x 9 = 81 feet deep.
Response:  If Bryan has 34 books and they are divided equally between two shelves, then each shelf must have half of 34, which is 17 books.
Response:  If Bryan has 42 books and each shelf contains 2 books, then he will need at least 42/2 = 21 shelves to store all his books.
"Response:  We know that Bryan has 27 books per étagère and he has 23 étagères in total. So, if we multiply 27 (books) x 23 (étagères), we get:  
27 x 23 = 611 books  
Therefore, Bryan has 611 books in total."
Response:  We know that each bookshelf has 9 books and 46 magazines, so if we multiply 10 (the number of bookshelves) by 9 (the number of books per shelf), we get 90 books in total. Now let's calculate how many magazines there are in total. If we multiply 10 (the number of bookshelves) by 46 (the number of magazines per shelf), we get 460 magazines in total. So, to summarize, Bryan has 90 books and 460 magazines.
"Response:  We know that Bryan has 29 étagères and each étagère contains either 23 books or 61 magazines (or both). So we can start by finding out how many bookshelves have only books and how many have only magazines. Then we can add up all the books and magazines to find the total number of each. Finally, we can multiply the number of bookshelves with only books by the number of books per shelf to get the total number of books, and do the same for the magazines.
Let X be the number of bookshelves with only books and Y be the number of bookshelves with only magazines. Since there are 29 bookshelves in total, we know that X + Y = 29.
We also know that each bookshelf with only books contains 23 books, so if X bookshelves have only books, then the total number of books is 23X. Similarly, if Y bookshelves have only magazines, then the total number of magazines is 61Y.
So our equation becomes:
23X + 61Y = 29(23) + 29(61)
Simplifying this equation gives us:
23X + 61Y = 578
Now we need to solve for X and Y. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for X, we get:
X = 29 - Y
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
23(29 - Y) + 61Y = 578
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
577 - 29Y + 61Y = 578
Y = 4
So there are 4 bookshelves with only magazines. Now we can find the total number of books and magazines. If X = 29 - 4 = 25, then there are 25 bookshelves with only books. The total number of books is:
Total Books = 23(25) = 575
The total number of magaz"
"Response:  We know that there are 7 étagères and each étagère has the same number of books. Since Bryan has a total of 28 books, we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Total Books = Number of Books per Étage x Number of Étages

Total Books = 28

Number of Books per Étage = Total Books / Number of Étages

Number of Books per Étage = 28 / 7

Number of Books per Étage = 4

So, there are 4 books on each étagère."
Response:  We know that each shelf contains two books, so if Bryan has a total of 38 books, he must have at least two shelves. Since there are no fractions of shelves, we can round up to three shelves (3 x 2 = 6). Therefore, Bryan has three shelves with a total of six books on each shelf for a grand total of 18 books.
Response:  If each pack contains 2 invitations and Carol wants to send an invitation to 10 friends, then she needs 10 x 2 = 20 invitations in total. So, she needs 20/2 = 10 packs of invitations.
"Response:  If Carol has bought 3 packets of invitations and each packet contains the same number of invitations, then she must have bought 3 times that number of invitations in total. So if x is the number of invitations in one packet, we know that Carol has bought 3x invitations altogether. Since there are 12 friends invited to the party, we can set up an equation as follows:  
3x = 12  
To solve for x, divide both sides by 3:  
x = 4  
So, there are 4 invitations in each packet."
Response:  If Carol has 7 x 10 = 70 invitations in total and she sends 2 invitations to her friends, then she will have 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left.
Response:  First, we know that Carol bought 6 packs of invitations, and each pack contains 14 invitations, so she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she bought 11 additional invitations, so now she has a total of 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Finally, we need to find out how many friends she can invite with these invitations. Since each invitation is for one friend, we can divide the total number of invitations by the number of friends per invitation: 95 / 1 = 95 friends.
Response:  If she has bought 2 packs of invitations and each pack contains 3 invitations, then she has a total of 6 invitations (2 x 3 = 6). Since she wants to invite 9 friends, she needs 9 - 6 = 3 more invitations. So, she will need to buy 3 additional invitations.
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored 12 points in each match and she has scored a total of 36 points. So we can start by writing an equation based on this information:  
Let x be the number of matches Melissa played. Since she scored 12 points in each match, she scored a total of 12x points. We also know that the total number of points she scored is equal to 36, so we can set up the following equation:  
12x = 36 Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12:  
x = 36 / 12 x = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 matches."
"Response:  We know that Melissa played three matches and scored a total of 81 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each match, we can set up an equation based on this information.
Let X be the number of points Melissa scored in one match.
Since she played three matches, we can write:
X + X + X = 81 (since she scored 81 points in total)
Simplifying the equation:
3X = 81
Dividing both sides by 3:
X = 27
So, Melissa scored 27 points in each match."
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in each match and obtained an additional 82 points as a bonus in each match. To find out how many points she scored in 79 matches, we can multiply the number of matches (79) by her score per match (109 + 82). Therefore, the total number of points Melissa scored is:  
79 x (109 + 82) = 79 x 191 = 14399."
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 21 points and she scored 7 points in each game. So we can start by multiplying the number of games she played by her score per game:  
21 = 7 x G (where G is the number of games) 
Now we need to solve for G. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:  
G = 21 / 7 
G = 3 
Therefore, Melissa played 3 games."
"Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 matches and she scored the same number of points at each match. So we can start by finding out how many points she scored per match. To do this, let's divide the total number of points she scored (91) by the number of matches she played (13).  
91 / 13 = 7 
So Melissa scored 7 points per match."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 seats in each car of the Ferris wheel and we want to find out how many people can sit in each seat. Since there are 20 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once, we can divide them equally among the cars. So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get:  

20 ÷ 4 = 5 

So, each seat in the Ferris wheel can hold 5 people."
"Response:  We know that there are several seats in the big wheel and each seat can accommodate 9 people. So if 18 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once, we need to find out how many seats the Ferris wheel has.
Let X be the number of seats in the Ferris wheel. Since each seat can hold 9 people, we have:
X x 9 = 18
Solving for X, we get:
X = 2
So the big wheel has 2 seats."
"Response:  We know that each big wheel has 19 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. So if we have 20 big wheels, how many people can ride them at once?  
To find out, we need to multiply the number of seats in each big wheel (19) by the number of big wheels (20):
19 x 20 = 380
So, 380 people can ride the 20 big wheels simultaneously!"
Response:  If there are 10 seats broken out of 18, that means we have 8 functional seats left (10 - 2 = 8). Each seat can accommodate 15 people, so in total, we have space for 8 x 15 = 120 people to ride the Ferris wheel at once.
"Response:  We know that each seat can accommodate 14 people and there are currently 16 people on the Ferris wheel. So we need to find out how many more people can fit in the remaining seats. There are 6 seats in total, and each seat has 14 available spaces, so we have:

6 x 14 = 84

So, 84 more people can join the Ferris wheel."
Response:  We know that there are 2 small places and 23 large places in total. Each small place can accommodate 14 people, so we have 2 x 14 = 28 people who can sit in the small places. Now let's calculate how many people can fit in the large places. There are 23 large places, each of which can hold 54 people, for a total of 23 x 54 = 1272 people. In total, then, we have 28 + 1272 = 1300 people who can ride the Ferris wheel.
Response:  We know that there are 7 great places and each can accommodate 12 people. So we multiply 7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit in the large places.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once and we also know that each seat can hold 4 people. So if we divide 16 by 4, we get:  
16 / 4 = 4 Therefore, each seat of the Ferris wheel can accommodate 4 people."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once and each seat can accommodate 2 people. So we need to find out how many seats the Ferris wheel has in total.

Let X be the number of seats the Ferris wheel has. Since each seat can accommodate 2 people, we know that X/2 is equal to the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

X/2 = 4 (since 4 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 8 (since 8 is double 4)

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 8 seats in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 pizzas in total and each pizza has the same number of parts. So if we divide 7 into equal parts, we can find out how many parts each pizza has. Let's try dividing 7 into 14 parts.  
14 / 7 = 2 (approximately)
So each pizza has approximately 2 parts."
Response:  If each pizza has two parts and we have ordered 28 parts in total, then we can conclude that we have ordered 14 pizzas (28 / 2 = 14).
"Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 parts. So we need to calculate how many parts of pizza there are in total. To do this, let's multiply the number of pizzas by the number of parts per pizza:  
17 x 4 = 68 parts of pizza in total."
"Response:  We have ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If there are 2 of us, we will divide the total number of slices among ourselves. So, if we divide 9 x 10 = 90 slices equally between two people, we will get:  
90 / 2 = 45 slices per person."
Response:  If there are 45 flower beds and each one has 10 seeds, then we can calculate how many seeds they have planted in total. We know that 10 x 45 = 450. So, they have planted 450 seeds.
Response:  We know that they have planted 45 seeds in total and divided them into 9 flowerbeds. So each flowerbed has 45/9 = 5 seeds.
Response:  We know that they had 36 seeds in total and they put 12 seeds in each flower bed. So if we divide 36 by 12, we get 3. That means they had 3 flower beds. And since only 58 flowers grew in each bed, we can multiply 3 by 58 to get 174 flowers in total.
"Response:  We know that they have planted 55 seeds in total and each parterre has 15 seeds. So, there are 55 / 15 = 3 parterres of flowers. Since only 60 flowers have grown in each parterre, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows:  
3 x 60 = 180 flowers."
"Response:  We know that they have planted 60 seeds in total and each parterre has 10 seeds. So we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Total Seeds = Number of Parterres x Number of Seeds per Parterre

We are given that Total Seeds is equal to 60. Therefore, we can solve for Number of Parterres as follows:

Number of Parterres = Total Seeds / Number of Seeds per Parterre
= 60 / 10
= 6

So there were 6 parterres of flowers."
Response:  We know that there are 8 flowerbeds in total and they have planted 32 seeds altogether. So each flowerbed has planted 4 seeds (32 / 8 = 4).
Response:  If Matthew gives 2 biscuits to each of his 11 friends, then he will give a total of 2 x 11 = 22 biscuits. So, Matthew had 22 biscuits in total.
Response:  If Matthew has given 2 biscuits to each of his friends, then he has given a total of 2 x 8 = 16 biscuits. So, Matthew has given biscuits to 16 friends.
"Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits to each of his 5 friends, then he must have given 5 x (number of biscuits per friend) = 5 x 10 = 50 biscuits in total. Since there are only 10 biscuits left for Matthew after giving them away, we can set up the equation:  
50 - 10 = 40. 
Now, let's solve for ""number of biscuits per friend"" :  
40 / 5 = 8. 
So, each of Matthew's friends ate 8 biscuits."
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits to his three friends, then he must have given 24/3 = 8 biscuits to each friend. Therefore, Matthew has 24 - 8 \* 3 = 24 - 24 = 0 biscuits left for himself. So, Matthew gave 8 biscuits to each of his three friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 11 friends an equal number of biscuits and cakes, then he would have given them a total of 11 x (number of biscuits + number of cakes) = 11 x 56 = 616 treats in total. Since there were only 22 biscuits to begin with, we know that each friend received at least one biscuit. So let's divide the total number of treats by the number of biscuits to find out how many biscuits each friend got: 616 / 22 = 28. Therefore, each of Matthew's 11 friends received 28 biscuits.
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of biscuits and cakes to his two friends, then he must have given half of his biscuits (14) and half of his cakes (15) to each friend. So each friend has eaten 14 biscuits and 15 cakes.
Response:  If Matthew gave the same number of biscuits and cakes to each of his 7 friends, then he gave a total of 14 + 21 = 35 treats to all 7 friends. Since there are 7 friends, each friend received 35 / 7 = 5 treats. So each person got 5 biscuits and 5 cakes.
"Response:  If Matthew gave the same number of biscuits to all his friends, then each friend received an equal amount of biscuits. Since there were 18 friends in total and Matthew had 36 biscuits, we can set up the following equation:  

36 / 18 = x / 18 (where x is the number of biscuits each person received)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2 (since 36 divided by 18 equals 2)

Therefore, each person received 2 biscuits from Matthew."
Response:  If Matthew had 36 biscuits and gave 6 to each of his friends, then he would have given a total of 6 x 4 = 24 biscuits. So, he has 36 - 24 = 12 biscuits left. Therefore, he has given biscuits to 12 friends.
Response:  We know that Matthew had 23 biscuits and gave an equal number of biscuits to his two friends. So, if we divide 23 by 3 (since there are three people), each person will get...?
Response:  We know that Matthew had 31 biscuits and he gave an equal number of biscuits to his 5 friends. So, if we divide 31 by 5, we get... (pause for students to calculate)...23! That means Matthew gave 23 biscuits to each of his 5 friends.
Response:  We know that Matthew gave each of his friends an equal number of biscuits and cakes. So if he had 32 biscuits in total, he would have given 32/4 = 8 biscuits to each friend. Similarly, since he had 98 cakes, he would have given 98/4 = 24 cakes to each friend.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends an equal number of biscuits and cakes, then he must have given them half of what he had of each. So, if he had 10 biscuits in total, he would have given each friend 5 biscuits (half of 10). And if he had 8 cakes, he would have given each friend 4 cakes (half of 8).
Response:  If Matthew gave the same number of biscuits and cakes to all his friends, then each friend received an equal amount of both. So we can start by finding out how many biscuits and cakes Matthew had in total. We know that he had 13 + 15 = 28 items in total. Now let's divide this number by the number of friends he has: 28 / 28 = 1. Since each friend got the same amount of biscuits and cakes, they each received 1 item from each category. Therefore, each person ate 1 biscuit and 1 cake.
"Response:  We know that Debby has drunk 109 bottles per day and she consumed them in 74 days. So we can calculate how many bottles she had in total as follows:  
Total number of bottles = Number of days x Bottles per day 
= 74 days x 109 bottles/day 
= 8231 bottles "
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 153 bottles of water and they lasted for 17 days. So she consumed the same number of bottles each day. To find out how many bottles she consumed each day, we can divide the total number of bottles by the number of days they lasted:  
153 bottles / 17 days = 9 bottles per day."
Response:  If she drinks 15 bottles per day for 11 days, then she will have drunk a total of 15 x 11 = 165 bottles. So, if she bought 264 bottles and drank 165, then she has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left.
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 301 bottles of water and she consumed 144 bottles per day for several days. So we can start by subtracting the number of bottles she consumed from the total number of bottles she bought to find out how many bottles are left:  

301 - 144 = 157  

Now we know that Debby has 157 bottles of water left. To find out how many days she consumed water, we can divide the number of bottles she has left by the number of bottles she consumes per day:  

157 / 144 = 1  

So Debby consumed water for one day."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were in promotion. If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, we can calculate how many days the water will last.  
Let's start with the number of bottles of water Debby drinks per day: 
4 bottles/day x 365 days (in a year) = 1,460 bottles of water consumed per year.  
Now, let's divide the total number of bottles of water Debby has by the number of bottles she consumes per year to find out how many years her supply of water will last:  
88 bottles / 1,460 bottles = approximately 0.06 years or 6 months.  
Therefore, Debby's supply of water will last for approximately 6 months if she continues to consume 4 bottles per day."
"Response:  We know that Debby drinks 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day. If we divide the total number of bottles she bought (200 + 256 = 456) by the number of bottles she drinks per day (312), we can find out how many days her supply of soda will last:  

456 / 312 = 1.47 days  
So, Debby's supply of soda will last approximately 1.47 days or 38 hours."
"Response:  If Debby drinks 6 bottles per day and there are 12 bottles in total, then she has enough water for:  

12 / 6 = 2 days

Therefore, her water supply will last for 2 days."
"Response:  We know that there are 180 bottles of water in total and Debby drinks 15 bottles per day. So we can calculate how many days the water will last as follows:  

180 / 15 = 12 days

Therefore, the water will last for 12 days if Debby drinks 15 bottles per day."
"Response:  We know that Debby has 360 bottles of soda and she drinks 9 bottles per day. To find out how many days the soda will last, we can divide the number of bottles by the number of bottles she drinks per day:  
360 / 9 = 40 days 
So, the soda will last for 40 days if Debby continues to drink 9 bottles per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 rows and each row has 11 crayons, so we can start by multiplying these two numbers together to get the total number of crayons:  
14 x 11 = 154 
So, Faye has 154 crayons in all!"
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 12 crayons in total and divided them into 3 rows. So each row must have 4 crayons (12 / 3 = 4).
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 packs of crayons and each pack contains 24 crayons. So she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 crayons. Since she places her crayons in rows with 16 crayons in each row, we can divide 672 by 16 to find out how many rows she could make: 672 / 16 = 41.5 (rounded up to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Faye could make 42 rows of crayons.
Response:  We know that each packet of crayons has 14 crayons and Faye has 6 packets. So she has 6 x 14 = 84 crayons in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 35 crayons in total and she wants to place them in rows of 5 crayons each. To find out how many rows she can make, we need to divide the number of crayons by the number of crayons per row (which is 5). So, we do:  
35 / 5 = 7 
So, Faye could make 7 rows of 5 crayons each if she had 35 crayons and 7 crayons of different colors."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 rows with 4 crayons in each row, so we can calculate how many crayons there are altogether.  
Therefore, to find out how many crayons Faye has, we need to multiply the number of rows (19) by the number of crayons in each row (4), which gives us:  
19 x 4 = 76  
So, Faye has 76 crayons!"
"Response:  We know that there are 7 rows with 36 crayons in each row, so we can calculate how many crayons of color there are as follows:  
Row 1: 36 x 1 = 36 yellow crayons (since all the crayons in this row are yellow)  
Row 2: 36 x 2 = 72 total crayons (including both yellow and colored crayons)  
Row 3: 36 x 3 = 108 total crayons (including both yellow and colored crayons)  
...  
Row 7: 36 x 7 = 252 total crayons (including both yellow and colored crayons)  
Therefore, there are 252 - 36 = 216 colored crayons in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 rows with 31 crayons in each row, so we can calculate how many crayons there are altogether as follows:  
11 x 31 = 341 crayons  
Now let's look at the number of colored pencils. There are 27 colored pencils in each row, and there are 11 rows, so we can calculate the total number of colored pencils like this:  
27 x 11 = 297 colored pencils  
So, to summarize, Faye has 341 crayons and 297 colored pencils in all."
"Response:  If Faye has 30 crayons and she places them in rows of 5 each, then she can make:  
30 / 5 = 6 rows."
Response:  If Faye had 6 crayons and placed them in two rows, then she must have placed an equal number of crayons in each row. Since there are 3 crayons in each row, we can conclude that Faye placed 3 crayons in each row.
"Response:  We know that each package contains 4 crayons and Faye has 35 packages. So she has a total of 35 x 4 = 140 crayons. Since she places her crayons in rows with 2 crayons per row, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Let R be the number of rows Faye can make with her crayons. Then we have:  
R x 2 = 140 (since there are 2 crayons in each row)  
Solving for R, we get:  
R = 70 (Since 70 x 2 = 140) Therefore, Faye can make 70 rows of crayons using all of her crayons."
Response:  If Faye has 31 packs of crayons and each pack contains 6 crayons, then she has a total of 31 x 6 = 186 crayons. Since she places her crayons in rows of 19 crayons each, she can make 186 / 19 = 10 rows of crayons. Therefore, Faye has 10 rows x 19 crayons per row = 190 crayons in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 rows and each row has 24 crayons, so we can start by multiplying 30 x 24 to get our total number of crayons in all rows:  
30 x 24 = 720 
Now, we also know that there are 71 crayons of color in addition to the 24 regular crayons in each row, so let's add 71 to our previous total:  
720 + 71 = 891 
Therefore, Faye has 891 crayons in total!"
"Response:  We know that there are 16 rows in total and each row has 6 colored pencils. So we can start by multiplying the number of rows by the number of colored pencils per row to find out how many colored pencils there are in total.  
16 x 6 = 96 
Therefore, Faye has 96 colored pencils in total."
Response:  We know that there are 7 buses and each bus can carry 10 students (since we have 7 buses and 7 x 10 = 70 students). So if all the buses are full, then the total number of seats in all the buses is 7 x 10 = 70.
"Response:  We know that there are 95 buses and each bus has 118 seats, so we can calculate how many students will be transported in total:  
95 buses x 118 seats per bus = 10,730 seats 
Since all buses are fully loaded, we can assume that every seat is occupied by a student. Therefore, we can estimate the number of students at school as follows:  
10,730 seats / 118 seats per bus = 9062 students 
So, there are approximately 9,062 students in this school."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classes and each class has 66 students. So, in total, how many students will be going on this field trip?  
To find out, we need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class. Can you do that for me? 
(67 x 66) =... 
That gives us a total of... students! Wow, that's a lot of kids! Now, we know that each bus can hold 6 students, so how many buses will we need to transport all these students? 
Can you divide the total number of students by 6 to get the number of buses we need?... / 6 =... 
So, we need... buses to take all the students on the field trip!"
"Response:  We know that there are 58 students in total and each class has the same number of students (let's say x). Since each bus can accommodate 2 students per seat, we need to divide 58 by 2 to find out how many buses are needed. So, we have:  
58 / 2 = 29
Therefore, we need 29 buses to transport all 58 students."
"Response:  We know that there are 120 students in total and each class has the same number of students. So we can start by dividing 120 by the number of classes:  
120 / 24 =... (divide both sides by 24)  
... = 5 (answer is 5) 
So, there are 5 students in each class."
"Response:  We know that there are 102 students in total and 8 seats per bus. If we subtract the number of students who do not want to go (22) from the total number of students, we get:

102 - 22 = 80

So, we need 80/8 = 10 buses for the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 11 students in total and we need to find out how many will participate in the field trip. If 8 of them do not want to go, then we have 11 - 8 = 3 students who will go on the field trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each room has 3 students. So we can start by multiplying these two numbers together to find out how many students there are in total:  
72 x 3 = 216 
Now we know that there are 216 students in the school. But we also know that there are 111 students going on the field trip. So we need to subtract the number of students who aren't going on the field trip from the total number of students:  
216 - 111 = 105 
So there will be 105 students going on the field trip. Since each bus can hold 3 students, we can divide the number of students going on the field trip by 3 to find out how many buses we need:  
105 / 3 = 35 
Therefore, we need 35 buses to transport all the students on the field trip."
"Response:  We know that there are 46 buses and each bus can carry a certain number of students. Since all the buses will be full, we need to find out how many students each bus can hold. To do this, we divide the total number of students (92) by the number of buses (46):

92 ÷ 46 =...

This gives us an average of approximately 2.04 students per bus. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a student, let's round up to the nearest whole number. So, each bus can hold approximately 2 students."
Response:  If there are 11 boys in the class and each boy gets 9 balls, then together they will have 11 x 9 = 99 balls. So, if Haley had to give 9 balls to each of the 11 boys, she would need 99 balls in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 99.
Response:  If Haley has 10 billes and gives 5 to each of the boys who like playing with balls, then she will give 5 x 2 = 10 billes in total. So there are 10 boys who like playing with balls.
Response:  If Haley has 23 billes and wants to keep 15 for herself, then she will give away 8 billes in total. Since there are 4 boys who like playing with balls, each boy will receive 8/4 = 2 billes from Haley.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 boys who like to play with balls and 50 boys in total. So if we divide 26 (the number of billes) by 13 (the number of ball players), each boy will receive approximately 26/13 = 2 billes. However, since we have more than 13 boys, we need to distribute the remaining billes among them. Since there are 50 - 13 = 37 other boys, they will each receive approximately 26 / 37 = 1 bille. Therefore, each boy will receive 2 + 1 = 3 billes."""
Response:  If Haley has 20 billes and she wants to distribute them equally among two boys who like playing with billes in her class, then each boy will receive half of the total number of billes. So, if we divide 20 by 2, we get 10. Therefore, each boy will receive 10 billes.
Response:  If Haley has 28 billes and gives 2 billes to each of the boys who like playing with balls, then she will have given 2 x 28 = 56 billes in total. So there are 56/2 = 28 boys who like playing with balls.
"Response:  We know that Frank reads 14 pages per day and there are 392 pages in total. To find out how many days it took him to finish the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:  
392 pages / 14 pages/day = 28 days 
Therefore, it took Frank 28 days to finish his favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. So we can start by calculating how many total pages he read during those 569 days:  
22 pages/day x 569 days = 12,408 pages 
Therefore, there are 12,408 pages in the book."
Response:  We know that there are 612 pages in total and Frank finished the book in 6 days. So he must have read an average of 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day.
Response:  We know that there are 555 pages in total and 5 chapters. So each chapter has 111 pages (555 / 5).
"Response:  We know that there are 15 chapters in total and each chapter has an equal number of pages (193 pages / 15 chapters = 12.8 pages per chapter). Now we can calculate how many pages Frank read per day:  
12.8 pages/chapter x 6 days/week = 76.8 pages/week  
Since it took him 660 days to finish the book, let's divide the total number of pages he read by the number of days it took him:  
76.8 pages/week x 4 weeks/month x 12 months = 3,072 pages/year  
3,072 pages/year / 660 days = approximately 4.5 pages per day  
Therefore, Frank read approximately 4.5 chapters per day."
"Response:  We know that each book has 249 pages and it took Frank three days to finish each book. So we can start by finding out how many pages he read per day. To do this, let's divide the total number of pages in each book (249) by the number of days it took him to finish the book (3):

249 pages / 3 days = 83 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 83 pages per day."
"Response:  We know that each book has 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish one book. So if he finished n books, he spent 12n days reading those books. Now we are given that Frank needs 492 days to finish all the books. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  
12n = 492 
Solving for n, we get: 
n = 492 / 12 
n = 30 
Therefore, Frank read 30 books in total."
"Response:  We know that the book had 112 pages and it took Frank 16 days to finish reading it. So we can start by dividing the total number of pages by the number of days he spent reading the book:  
112 pages / 16 days =... 
Now we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we divide the result from the previous calculation by the number of days: 
... =... pages/day 
So, Frank read... pages per day."
"Response:  We know that Frank reads 8 pages per day and there are in total 576 pages in the book. To find out how many days it took him to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day:  
576 pages / 8 pages/day = 72 days 
Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages. So, if Frank finished the book in 30 days, he must have read an average of 41 x 450 = 18,900 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that there are three chapters in total and each chapter has 594 pages. So we can start by finding out how many pages are in one chapter:  
594 pages/chapter = 594 x 3 = 1782 pages."
"Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 664 days and it had two chapters with 405 pages each. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book (810) by the number of days he spent reading (664).  
So, the calculation is as follows:

810 pages / 664 days = x chapters/day

Now, let's simplify the fraction:

x = 810 / 664

x = 4

Therefore, Frank read four chapters per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 packs of DVDs and we want to find out how much each pack costs. To do this, we can divide the total amount of money (120 dollars) by the number of packs (6): 
120 / 6 = 20 
So, each pack of DVDs costs 20 dollars."
"Response:  If each pack costs $81, then to find out how much it would cost to buy 33 packs, we need to multiply the number of packs by the price of one pack. So... 
$81 x 33 = $2693"
"Response:  If there is a reduction of $106 per pack and each pack costs $107 before discount, then after the discount, how much will each pack cost?  
$107 - $106 = $1  
So, each pack will cost $1 after the discount. Now, let's calculate how many packs you can buy with $93:  
$93 / $1 = 93 packs  
Therefore, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs with $93 if there is a reduction of $106 per pack."
"Response:  If there is a reduction of $25 on each pack, then we can calculate how much you will pay for one pack as follows: 
$76 (original price) - $25 (reduction) = $51 
So, to buy one pack, you need to pay $51."
Response:  We know that each pack of DVD costs $26 and we have $104 to spend. To find out how many packs we can buy, let's divide our total amount of money by the cost per pack: $104 / $26 = 4. So, we can buy 4 packs of DVDs with our $104.
Response:  We know that we have $28 and we want to buy 2 packs of DVDs. So, if we divide $28 by 2, we get $14 per pack. Therefore, each pack costs $14.
Response:  If there are 18 bananas in total and they are grouped into sets of size 2, then we can make 9 groups (18 / 2 = 9).
Response:  If there are 140 groups of size 187 in Philip's collection of bananas and each group contains 187 bananas, then the total number of bananas in his collection is 140 x 187 = 25,960 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and we want to divide them into groups of size x. Since there are 7 groups of oranges, we can assume that each group of bananas will have 203/7 = 29 bananas. So, the size of each group of bananas is 29.
"Response:  We know that there are 356 oranges in total and they are organized into groups. Since each group has 47 bananas, we can start by dividing 356 by 47 to find out how many groups of oranges there will be.  
356 / 47 = 7 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
So, there will be 7 groups of oranges. Now, since each group has 47 bananas, we can divide 47 by 7 to find out how many oranges are in each group.  
47 / 7 = 6 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
Therefore, each group of oranges will have 6 oranges."
Response:  We know that there are 392 bananas in all and they are divided into 196 groups. So each group has to have 2 bananas (since we need one more group with only one banana). Therefore, the size of each group is 2.
"Response:  We know that there are 180 bananas in all and they are grouped into sets of size 18. So we can divide 180 by 18 to find out how many groups there are:

180 / 18 = 10
Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection."
Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. So each group has 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145).
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges in total and they are divided into 16 groups. So each group has 384/16 = 24 oranges.
"Response:  If each cookie has 19 cookies and there are 38 cookies in total, then we can calculate how many invitations were sent out as follows:  
38 x 19 = 742 
Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 742 cookies for the guests."
"Response:  If each person has 30 cookies and there are 14 people in total, then we can calculate how many cookies have been prepared as follows:  
14 x 30 = 420 cookies."
"Response:  We know that there were initially 22 cookies and Brenda's mother had to throw away 17 of them. So, how many cookies are left?  
22 - 17 = 5!
Therefore, each person got 5 cookies."
"Response:  We know that there were 10 invited guests in total and only 9 showed up. That means we have to subtract 9 from 10 to find out how many cookies were left over.  
So, if we subtract 9 from 10, we get... (drumroll please)... 1! Yes, one cookie was left over. Now let's divide the number of cookies left over by the number of guests who did show up.  
If we divide 1 by 9, we get... (think, think)... 0.11! That's right, each guest received approximately 0.11 cookies (or about 1/9 of a cookie)."
Response:  If each of the two guests had the same number of cookies, then they would have received half of the total number of cookies made by Brenda's mother, which is 14 cookies / 2 = 7 cookies per guest.
"Response:  If each invitee received 2 cookies, then the number of invitees can be found by dividing the total number of cookies by 2. In this case, we know that there are 10 cookies in total, so...  
10 / 2 = 5 
Therefore, the mother prepared cookies for 5 invitees."
Response:  If Frank has 42 candies and puts them in two bags, then each bag will have half of the total number of candies, which is 42 / 2 = 21 candies in each bag.
"Response:  If Frank has x number of bonbons and he puts them into 26 bags with 33 bonbons in each bag, then we can set up an equation to represent this situation. We know that there are 33 bonbons in each bag, so if Frank has x number of bonbons, he will have 33x number of bonbons in total. Since there are 26 bags, we can write the equation as follows:  
33x = 26(33) 
Simplifying the equation, we get:  
33x = 858 
Dividing both sides by 33, we get:  
x = 26 
Therefore, Frank had 26 bonbons."
Response:  We know that Frank had 33 candies and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 candies left. Since each bag contains 9 candies, we can put all 9 remaining candies in one bag. Therefore, there will be only one bag.
Response:  If Frank has 22 candies and each bag contains 11 candies, then he would need 22/11 = 2 bags of candy.
"Response:  If Frank has 16 candies in total and he put some of them into two bags, then each bag must contain an equal number of candies. So, if one bag contains x candies, the other bag will contain 16 - x candies. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (16 - x) = 16

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 16

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 8

So there are 8 candies in each bag."
Response:  If each case contains 14 boxes of Trefoils, and Shirley sold 25 cases, then she must deliver 25 x 14 = 350 boxes of Trefoils in total.
"Response:  We know that Shirley sold 10 boxes of Trefoils and needs to deliver 5 cases (or 60 boxes) in total. Since each case contains 12 boxes, we can calculate how many boxes are in each case as follows:  
5 cases x 12 boxes/case = 60 boxes  
Therefore, there are 60 / 12 = 5 boxes in each case."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 bouteilles of regular soda and 9 bouteilles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda they have than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda. So, if we do this, we get:  
67 - 9 = 58 
So, they had 58 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of soda is 83 (22 + 61). To find out how many more bottles of diet soda there are than regular soda, we need to subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the total number of bottles. So, if we subtract 22 from 83, we get:  
83 - 22 = 61 
Therefore, there are 61 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 + 8 = 38 bouteilles of soda in total. And we also know that there are 41 apples. So, if we add all these numbers together, we get:  
38 + 41 = 79. 
Therefore, the store had 79 bottles in total (38 bottles of soda and 41 apples)."
"Response:  We know that there are 79 bouteilles of regular soda and 53 bouteilles of diet soda. To find out how many more regular soda bottles there are than diet soda bottles, we need to subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the number of regular soda bottles. So, if we do this, we get:  
79 - 53 = 26 
So, there are 26 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles."
"Response:  We know that there are 54 bouteilles of diet soda and 83 bouteilles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda. So let's do this:

83 - 54 = 29
Therefore, they had 29 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
"Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles in total and 9 of them were regular soda bottles. That means we have 8 more bottles left, which are diet sodas. So, if we divide 8 by 2 (since each diet soda bottle contains 2 liters), we get:  
8 / 2 = 4  
Therefore, they had 4 diet soda bottles."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 bouteilles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of bottles of diet soda from the total number of bottles of regular soda. So let's do this:

60 (regular soda) - 19 (diet soda) = 41

So, the store had 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that there are 78 apples and we want to find out how many bottles of soda they have more than apples. So let's start with the total number of bottles of soda. There were 72 regular sodas + 32 diet sodas = 104 bottles of soda in total. Now, compare this to the number of apples. They had 78 apples. Therefore, they have 78 - 104 = 26 fewer bottles of soda than apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 pommes and x bouteilles of soda (where x is the number of bouteilles). To find out how many more bottles they have than apples, we need to subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles. So, if we do this, we get: 
x - 36 =? 
Can you solve for x?"
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles in total and 28 of them are regular soda bottles. That means we have 30 - 28 = 2 bottles left for diet soda. So, they had 2 bottles of diet soda.
Response:  We know that the store had 4 bottles of diet soda and 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda. So if we let D represent the number of bottles of diet soda, then the total number of bottles of soda they have is D + 79. Since there are only four bottles of diet soda, we can write this as 4 + 79 =. Therefore, the store has 83 bottles of regular soda (79 + 4).
Response:  We know that we have 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 bottles of soda in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 81 bouteilles of ordinary soda and 60 bouteilles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of ordinary soda than diet soda, we need to subtract the number of diet soda from the total number of ordinary soda. So, if we do this, we get:  
81 - 60 = 21 
Therefore, they had 21 more bottles of ordinary soda than diet soda."
Response:  We know that the store had 49 regular bottles of soda and 40 dietetic bottles of soda. To find out how many bottles they had in total, we need to add these two numbers together. So, if we add 49 + 40, we get... (drumroll please)... 89! That means the store had 89 bottles of soda in total.
"Response:  We know that there were 295 visitors to the palace yesterday and 317 today. To find out how many more people visited the palace today compared to yesterday, we need to subtract the number of visitors from yesterday from the number of visitors today. So, if we subtract 295 from 317, we get:  

317 - 295 = 22

Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to the palace today than there were yesterday."
"Response:  We know that there were 246 visitors to the palace on this day and 703 visitors the previous day. So in total, there have been 949 visitors over two days (246 + 703). To find out how many visitors visited the palace in 25 days, we can divide 949 by 25:  
949 / 25 = 38 
So, 38 visitors visited the palace every day for 25 days."
"Response:  We know that there were 100 visitors to the palace yesterday and 666 visitors today. To find out how many more visitors came to the palace today compared to yesterday, we need to subtract the number of visitors from yesterday from the total number of visitors today. So, if we subtract 100 from 666, we get:

666 - 100 = 566

Therefore, there were 566 more visitors to the palace today than there were yesterday."
Response:  We know that in total, 406 people visited the palace of Buckingham during the last 327 days. This means that on average, about 1.25 people visit the palace every day (406 / 327 = 1.25). Now we are given that 132 visitors came to the palace today. To find out how many visitors came yesterday, we can subtract the number of visitors who came today from the total number of visitors over the past 327 days. So, let's do this: 132 - 1.25 x 327 = 132 - 406 = -274. Therefore, there were -274 visitors yesterday.
"Response:  We know that 45 visitors came to the palace yesterday and 829 people visited the palace in the last 85 days. So we can start by subtracting the number of visitors who came yesterday from the total number of visitors over the past 85 days.  
45 - 829 =  
Subtracting 45 from 829 gives us:  
829 - 45 =  
Now let's simplify this equation:  
829 - 45 =  784  
Therefore, there were 784 visitors at the palace today."
Response:  We know that there were 557 visitors to the palace of Buckingham today and 188 visitors yesterday. So in total, there have been 557 + 188 = 745 visitors to the palace over the past two days. Since we are asked how many people visited the palace in 57 days, we can divide the number of visitors over the past two days by the number of days: 745 / 2 = 372.5 visitors per day. Therefore, there were approximately 372.5 x 57 = 20,967.5 visitors to the palace of Buckingham in 57 days.
"Response:  We know that there were 661 visitors to the palace yesterday and 600 visitors the day before. To find out how many more visitors came to the palace today compared to the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day from the total number of visitors for today. So, if we subtract 600 from 661, we get:

661 - 600 = 61

Therefore, there were 61 more visitors to the palace today compared to the previous day."
"Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to the palace on this day. If we subtract the number of visitors from the previous two days (419 + 103 = 522), we get the total number of visitors before today:

522 - 92 = 430

So, 430 people visited the palace before today."
"Response:  We know that there were 471 visitors yesterday and 808 visitors the day before that, so in total, there were 471 + 808 = 1279 visitors in the past two days. Since today is the 89th day, we need to find out how many visitors came during those 89 days. To do this, we can subtract the number of visitors from the past two days (1279) from the total number of visitors during the 89 days:  
1279 - 1279 = 0. Therefore, exactly 0 people visited the palace of Buckingham during the last 89 days."
"Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to the palace on this day. On the previous day, there were 191 visitors and on the day before that, there were 457 visitors. So, in total, there were 191 + 457 = 648 visitors over the two days prior to today. To find out how many more visitors came to the palace today than on the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors on those days from the total number of visitors today. Therefore, we have:  
705 - 648 = 57 
So, there were 57 more visitors to the palace today than on the previous 245 days."
"Response:  We know that he needs 159 grams of glue to stick the feathers together and there is already 628 grams of glue for all the feathers. So we can subtract 159 from 628 to find out how much glue he has already.  
628 - 159 = 469
So he has already used 469 grams of glue."
"Response:  We know that he needs 288 grams of wax for all his feathers and he has already collected 260 grams. So we can calculate how much more wax he still needs to collect as follows:  

288 - 260 = 28

Therefore, he still needs 28 grams of wax."
"Response:  We know that he needs 22g of cire for each feather and there are 18 feathers in total. So we can calculate how much cire he will need as follows:  
22g x 18 = 404g  
So he has already used 404g - 22g = 382g of cire."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much cire is needed for all of the feathers. We know that each feather needs 166 grams of cire and there are 5 feathers in total. So, we can multiply the number of feathers by the amount of cire needed per feather to find out how much cire is needed in total.  
5 feathers x 166 grams/feather = 830 grams  
Now, we compare this with the amount of cire that he has available (20 grams). To find out how many more grams of cire he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total amount needed.  
830 grams - 20 grams = 810 grams  
So, he needs an additional 810 grams of cire to complete his list of things to do."
"Response:  We know that he has 557 grams of glue and needs 17 grams for now. To find out how much glue the feathers need, we can subtract the amount he currently uses from the total amount of glue he has:  
557 - 17 = 539 grams. 
Therefore, the feathers require 539 grams of glue."
"Response:  We know that he has 11 grams of glue and needs a total of 492 grams to stick all his feathers together. So we can start by subtracting what he already has from what he needs:  
492 - 11 = 481 grams. 
Therefore, he needs an additional 481 - 11 = 470 grams of glue."
"Response:  We know that there are 94 cueilleurs and they can fill 90 tonneaux in 6 days. So we need to find out how many tonnes of grapes each cueilleur can harvest per day. To do this, let's divide the total number of tonneaux by the number of cueilleurs:  
90 tonneaux / 94 cueilleurs = x tonneaux/cueilleur 
x = 90 / 94 = 0.95 tonneaux/cueilleur 
So each cueilleur can harvest approximately 0.95 tonneaux of grapes per day. Now we can calculate how many tonneaux would be filled per day if all 94 cueilleurs worked together:  
0.95 tonneaux/cueilleur x 94 cueilleurs = 87.3 tonneaux/day (approximately) 
Therefore, approximately 87.3 tonneaux of grapes would be filled per day if all 94 cueilleurs worked together."
"Response:  We know that there are 266 pickers and they fill 90 barrels in 5 days. So we can calculate how many barrels each day. To do this, divide the total number of barrels by the number of days:  
90 / 5 = 18 barrels per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 300 days in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 300 by 24, we get 7200 hours in a year. Now, let's divide this number by the number of hours worked per day (24) to find out how many days it would take to fill 244 tonnes of grapes.  
7200 / 24 = 300 days
Therefore, it would take 300 days to fill 244 tonnes of grapes. However, since there are only 146 days left in the year, we need to adjust our calculation accordingly. To do this, we can simply divide 300 by 146 to find out how much less time is needed to fill 244 tonnes of grapes.  
300 / 146 = 2.08 days
So, it would take approximately 2.08 days to fill 244 tonnes of grapes with 294 workers working for 146 days."
Response:  We know that there are 235 cueilleurs and they collect 100 barils of framboises per day, so each cueilleur collects approximately 0.43 barils of framboises per day (100/235). Now we need to calculate how many barils of raisins will be collected in 77 days. Since there are 221 cueilleurs collecting raisins, we can multiply the number of cueilleurs by the amount each one collects per day: 221 x 0.43 = 96.83 barils of raisins per day. To find out how many barils of raisins will be collected in 77 days, we can simply multiply 96.83 by 77: 77 x 96.83 = 7,457.71 barils of raisins.
"Response:  We know that there are 252 cueilleurs and they fill 108 tambours of grapes per day. So, in one day, they fill:

252 x 108 = 26,944 tambours

Now, we want to find out how many tambours will be filled in 58 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of tambours filled in one day by the number of days:

26,944 x 58 = 1,532,972 tambours

So, in 58 days, the cueilleurs will fill approximately 1,532,972 tambours of grapes."
"Response:  We know that there are 36 cueilleurs and they fill 8 tonneaux per day. So, we can calculate how many days it will take to fill 240 tonneaux as follows:

240 tonneaux / 8 tonneaux/day = 30 days

Therefore, it will take 30 days to fill 240 tonneaux of grapes with 36 cueilleurs working for 8 days."
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums and each aquarium has the same number of marine animals. So if we divide 26 into 52 (the total number of marine animals), we get 2 as our quotient. Therefore, each aquarium has 2 marine animals.
"Response:  If he had a total of 40 animals in different aquariums and each aquarium contains 2 animals, then we can set up an equation to represent this information.
Let x be the number of aquariums. Since each aquarium contains 2 animals, the total number of animals is 2x.
We know that the total number of animals is 40. So we can write the equation as follows:
2x = 40
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 20
Therefore, the person had 20 aquariums with 2 animals in each aquarium, for a total of 40 animals."
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 39 animals. So, to find out how many marine animals Tyler has in total, we need to multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium.

56 aquariums x 39 animals/aquarium = 2,244 marine animals

Therefore, Tyler has 2,244 marine animals."
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 22 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals. So, to find out how many saltwater animals Tyler has in total, we can multiply the number of aquariums by the number of animals in each aquarium:  
22 x 46 = 992. Therefore, Tyler has 992 saltwater animals."
"Response:  We know that he has 15 aquariums for marine animals and each aquarium contains 19 animals, so we can calculate as follows:  
15 x 19 = 285 animals (for marine animals) 
And he also has 62 aquariums for freshwater animals, each containing 19 animals, so we can calculate as follows:  
62 x 19 = 1178 animals (for freshwater animals) 
Therefore, in total, he has 285 + 1178 = 1463 animals."
"Response:  If mum buys 39 t-shirts, and each pack contains 13 t-shirts, then she will need to buy... 
39 / 13 = 3 packets of t-shirts."
"Response:  If Mom buys 66 white T-shirts and each pack contains 3 T-shirts, we can calculate how many packets she will have to buy. To do this, we need to divide 66 by 3 (the number of T-shirts in each packet). So...

66 ÷ 3 = 22

Therefore, Mom needs to buy 22 packets of white T-shirts."
"Response:  We know that each pack contains 56 t-shirts in total and there are 28 packs. So we can calculate how many t-shirts are in one pack by dividing the total number of t-shirts by the number of packs:  
56 / 28 = 2  
Therefore, each pack contains 2 t-shirts."
Response:  If mum buys 57 packs of white T-shirts and each pack contains 53 T-shirts, then she will have bought a total of 57 x 53 = 3091 T-shirts.
"Response:  We know that maman wants to buy 51 t-shirts and each pack contains 3 t-shirts. So we can calculate how many packs she needs like this:
51 / 3 = 17
So maman will need 17 packs of t-shirts."
"Response:  We know that maman buys 70 t-shirts in total and she buys them in packs of 14 each time. So we can start by finding out how many times 14 goes into 70. Can you do this calculation?  

Question: Oui, I can do it! 14 x 5 = 70.
Answer: Exactly right! That means maman needs to buy 5 packs of t-shirts. Now let's find out how many t-shirts are in each pack. Do you remember from the problem statement that there are 14 t-shirts in each pack? 

Question: Yes, I remember! Answer: Great! So if maman buys 5 packs, she will have 5 x 14 = 70 t-shirts in total."
Response:  We know that there are 36 biscuits in total and we have 4 bags of biscuits. So each bag must contain 9 biscuits (36 / 4 = 9).
"Response:  If I have 33 cookies in total and each bag contains 11 cookies, then I can make:  
33 / 11 = 3 bags of cookies."
"Response:  If each bag contains 41 cookies and we have 53 bags of cookies, then we can calculate how many cookies we have in total as follows:  
Total number of cookies = Number of bags x Number of cookies per bag 
= 53 x 41 
= 2193 cookies."
"Response:  We know that there are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags containing an equal number of cookies. So we can start by dividing 14 by 7 to find out how many cookies each bag contains.  
14 / 7 = 2  
So each bag contains 2 cookies."
Response:  If each bag contains 3 cookies and I have a total of 21 cookies, then I must have (21 / 3) = 7 bags of cookies.
"Response:  We know that each bag contains an equal number of biscuits, so we can start by finding out how many biscuits are in one bag. To do this, we divide the total number of biscuits (52) by the number of bags (x): 
52 / x = 15 
Now we solve for x to find out how many bags we have: 
x = 52 / 15 
x = 3
So we have three bags of biscuits with 15 biscuits in each bag."
"Response:  We know that we have 28 biscuits in total and each bag contains an equal number of biscuits. So if we divide 28 by the number of biscuits per bag, we will get the number of bags. In this case, let's assume there are x bags of biscuits.  
We also know that we have 86 candies in total. Since each bag has the same number of candies as it does biscuits, we can say that each bag contains 86/x candies.  
Now we need to find out how many bags of biscuits we have. To do this, we can set up two equations based on the information given:  
Equation 1: Number of biscuits = Number of bags x Number of biscuits per bag  
Equation 2: Number of candies = Number of bags x Number of candies per bag  
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  
Number of biscuits per bag = 28 / x  
Number of candies per bag = 86 / x  
Now we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of Equation 1 by x and then subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:  
x = (28 * x) / 86  
x = (28 * x) / 28  
x = 4  
So we have 4 bags of biscuits with 7 biscuits in each bag (since 28 / 4 = 7)."
"Response:  We know that each house in the patio receives 5 unwanted flyers and there are 25 flyers distributed in total among all houses in the patio. To find out how many houses there are in the patio, we can divide the number of flyers by the number of flyers per house:  
25 (flyers) / 5 (flyers per house) = 5 (houses) 
Therefore, there are 5 houses in the patio."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and 9 pieces of unwanted mail must be distributed to each house, then we can calculate as follows:  
20 x 9 = 180 pieces of unwanted mail per block."
"Response:  If there are 6 houses in a row and each house needs to receive 24 pieces of unwanted mail, then we can start by dividing 24 by 6. 

24 / 6 = 4

So, each house should receive 4 pieces of unwanted mail."
"Response:  If there are 14 advertisements that need to be distributed and each house receives 2 advertisements, then we can start by dividing 14 by 2 to find out how many groups of 2 advertisements we have.  
14 / 2 = 7  
So, we have 7 groups of 2 advertisements. Now, let's think about how many houses are in each group. Since each group contains 2 advertisements, we know that each group must contain 2 houses as well. Therefore, if we divide 7 by 2, we will find out how many houses are in each group.  
7 / 2 = 3  
So, there are 3 houses in each group. Finally, to find out how many houses are in a pâté of houses (a ""pâté"" is a French word for a ""batch"" or a ""grouping""), we just need to multiply the number of groups by the number of houses in each group.  
7 x 3 = 21  
Therefore, there are 21 houses in a pâté of houses."
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block of houses and 32 pieces of unwanted mail to distribute among them, then we need to find out how many pieces of unwanted mail each block of houses will receive. To do this, let's divide 32 by 20 (the number of houses in each block): 
32 / 20 = 16
So each block of houses will receive 16 pieces of unwanted mail."
"Response:  If there are 19 houses in each block of houses and 30 pieces of unwanted mail to distribute among them, we can calculate how many pieces of unwanted mail each house will receive as follows:  
30 / 19 = 1.58 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)  
Therefore, each house in the block will receive 2 pieces of unwanted mail."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 pieces of undesirable mail to distribute and 55 blocks in total. If each block receives 32 pieces of mail, we can set up an equation as follows:

8 (total) = 32 x (number of blocks)

Solving for the number of blocks, we get:

Number of blocks = 8 / 32
= 2

Therefore, there are 2 blocks in total. Since each block contains 32 houses, there are 2 x 32 = 64 houses in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses. So, if we want to distribute 4 pieces of unwanted mail to each house, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the number of houses per block. Therefore, the answer is:  
81 x 12 = 972 pieces of unwanted mail."
Response:  If there are 17 houses in each block and 4 pieces of undesirable mail to be distributed to each house, then we need to distribute 17 x 4 = 68 pieces of mail in total.
"Response:  We have 20 billes and we want to divide them into groups of 4. So, we can make:  
20 / 4 = 5 groups of 4 billes each. 
Therefore, there will be 5 groups created."
"Response:  We have 15 eggs and we want to divide them into groups of 5. To do this, we can use division. Specifically, we can ask ""How many times can we divide 15 by 5?"" or ""What is 15 divided by 5?"". The result of this calculation is 3, so we will create 3 groups of 5 eggs each."""
"Response:  If Rebecca has n groups of eggs and each group contains 2 eggs, then she has a total of 2n eggs. Since Rebecca wants to divide her eggs into groups of 11, we can set up an equation as follows:

2n = 11 x (number of groups)

Solving for n, we get:

2n = 11x(number of groups)
2n = 11(n)
2n = 11^2
2n = 121

Therefore, Rebecca has 121 eggs in total."
Response:  We have 8 eggs and we want to divide them into 4 groups. If we divide 8 by 4, we get 2. So each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We have 15 eggs and we want to divide them into 3 groups. If we divide 15 by 3, we get 5 as our quotient (result of division). So each group will have 5 eggs.
"Response:  We have 18 eggs and we want to divide them into groups of 6. So, we can make:  
18 / 6 = 3 groups  
Therefore, there will be 3 groups of eggs."
Response:  We have 99 bananas and we want to divide them into groups of 3. Since there are 99 items in total, we can make 99/3 = 33 groups of 3 bananas each. Now let's talk about the eggs. There are 9 eggs in total, so we can make 9/3 = 3 groups of 3 eggs each. Finally, we have 27 marbles left over, which is not enough to make any full groups of 3. So we will just count how many groups of 2 marbles we can make, and that will be our final answer. To do this, we can simply divide 27 by 2, giving us 13 groups of 2 marbles each. Therefore, our final answer is 33 + 3 + 13 = 59 groups in total.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 balls. To divide the eggs into groups of 5, we need to find out how many groups she can make. If we divide 20 by 5, we get... (pause for student to calculate)...7! That means Rebecca has 7 groups of 5 eggs each. Now let's look at the number of balls she has. She has 6 balls. If we divide 6 by 5, we get... (pause for student to calculate)...1 ball left over! So Rebecca has 7 groups of 5 eggs each and 1 ball left over. In total, she has 7 + 1 = 8 more eggs than balls."""
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 billes and 12 eggs. To divide the eggs into groups of 20, we need to find out how many groups she can make with 12 eggs.  
We can divide 12 by 20 to get the number of groups: 12 / 20 = 0 remainder 6. So, Rebecca has 6 more eggs than billes."
"Response:  We know that Luke scored 154 points and won 11 points each round. So we can start with the last round first. If he won 11 points in the final round, then his score would be:  
154 + 11 = 165 points. Now let's go back to the previous round. He also won 11 points there, so his score after that round would be:  
165 - 11 = 154 points. And we keep going back until we reach the first round. Since he started with zero points, his score at the end of the first round was:  
0 + 11 = 11 points. Therefore, Luke played for 15 rounds (15 x 11 = 165)."
"Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds and won 46 points each round, then he scored in total:  
46 x 177 = 8392 points."
"Response:  We know that Luke has scored 84 points in total and he played two rounds of the game. So we can start by finding out how many points he scored per round. To do this, let's divide the total number of points by the number of rounds he played:  
84 points / 2 rounds = 42 points per round. 
Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round."
Response:  If Luke has played 157 rounds of a game and won 146 points in each round, then he has scored a total of 146 x 157 = 23,092 points throughout the game.
"Response:  We know that Luke scored 78 points in the game of questions and answers, and we also know that he earned 3 points at each turn. So if we divide 78 by 3, we get:  
78 / 3 = 26 
Therefore, Luke played 26 turns in the game of questions and answers."
Response:  If Emily had only two pearls and she made 32 collars, then each collar must have had at least one pearl. So, each collar needs one pearl.
"Response:  We know that Emily made 11 collars and each collar requires 28 beads. So we can start with this information to find out how many beads she had in total.  
Let X represent the number of beads Emily used. Since each collar needs 28 beads, we can write an equation based on this information:
X = 11 x 28
To solve for X, let's simplify the equation:
X = 11 x 28
X = 308
Therefore, Emily had 308 beads in total."
"Response:  If Emily has 16 beads and each collar requires 8 beads, then she can make:  
16 / 8 = 2 collars. 
Therefore, Emily can make two collars with her 16 beads."
Response:  If Emily has made 18 colliers and she had 6 perles at first, then each collier needs 6/18 = 3 perles. So each collier needs 3 perles.
Response:  If each collar takes 5 beads and she has made 4 collars, then she needs 4 x 5 = 20 beads in total. So Emily had 20 beads to make her collars.
Response:  If Emily has 6 perles and each collier requires 3 perles, then she can make 6/3 = 2 colliers. Since she wants to make colliers for her 72 friends, she will have to repeat this process 72/2 = 36 times. Therefore, Emily can make 36 x 2 = 72 colliers in total.
Response:  If Emily has 5 beads and she can make 20 collars, then each collar needs 5 x 20 = 100 beads.
Response:  We know that each collar takes 2 beads and Emily has made 26 collars. So she needs 2 x 26 = 52 beads in total.
"Response:  We have two numbers of children who went to summer camp and those who stayed at home. To find out how many more children went to the camp than stayed at home, we need to subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children in the county. So let's start with the first number:

Total number of children in the county = 819058 + 668278 = 1487336

Now, let's subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children in the county:

1487336 - 668278 = 818058

Therefore, there are 818058 - 668278 = 150181 more children who spent their summer vacations at camp compared to those who remained at home."
"Response:  We know that 202958 children went to camp and 777622 remained at home. To find out how many more children stayed at home than went to camp, we need to subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children who remained at home.  
So, if we subtract 202958 from 777622, we get:  
777622 - 202958 = 574664  
Therefore, there are 574664 children who stayed at home compared to 202958 children who went to camp."
"Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in Lawrence County and 629424 of them go to camp during summer vacation. To find out how many children remain at home, we can subtract the number of children who go to camp from the total number of children:  
898051 - 629424 = 268627 
Therefore, 268627 children remain at home during summer vacation."
"Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County and 274,865 of them stay at home during summer vacation. So, we can calculate how many go to camp as follows:  
313,473 - 274,865 = 38,608 
Therefore, approximately 38,608 children go to camp during the summer vacations in Lawrence County."
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation and 455682 children who go to camp. To find out how many children there are in total, we can add these two numbers together. So, approximately, there are 907611 + 455682 = 1363293 children in the county of Lawrence.
"Response:  We know that 800059 children went to summer camp and we want to find out how many remained at home. To do this, we subtract the number of children who went to camp from the total number of children in the county. So, if we subtract 800059 from 828521, we get:  
828521 - 800059 = 284662 
Therefore, approximately 284662 children remained at home during the summer holidays."
"Response:  We know that 61619 children stayed at home during summer vacation and 91676 is the total number of children in the county. So we can subtract 61619 from 91676 to find out how many children went to camp:

91676 - 61619 = 30057

Therefore, approximately 30057 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp."
"Response:  We know that 34044 children from the county of Lawrence went to camp during the summer holidays and 134867 remained at home. Additionally, we have 424944 children who came from outside the county to attend the camp. To find out how many children attended the camp in total, let's add all these numbers together:  
34044 + 134867 + 424944 = 599855 children attended the camp."
Response:  We know that in total there are 610769 + 22 = 610991 children in the county of Lawrence during summer vacation. Of these, 590796 remain at home and 610769 attend the camp. Therefore, approximately 610769 - 590796 = 20983 children live in the county of Lawrence.
"Response:  We know that in total there are 644997 + 893835 = 1538832 children in the county of Lawrence. Of these, 78 come from outside the county, so we subtract 78 from the total to get the number of children who live in the county:  
1538832 - 78 = 1538754 children living in the county of Lawrence."
Response:  We know that Adam has 9 apples and 3 more than Jackie. So if we subtract 3 from 9, we get 6. Therefore, Jackie has 6 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So...

10 - 2 =...

Do you see the solution? That's right! Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie."
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 9 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So...

Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam."
"Response:  We know that Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has. So...

Jackie has 10 - 8 = 2 more apples than Adam."
"Response:  We know that together, Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. If one of them has 4 more than the other, then we can say that Adam has x apples (where x is a number) and Jackie has x + 4 apples. Since they both have the same amount of apples, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 4) = 6... (1)

Now let's simplify the equation:

2x + 4 = 6... (2)

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

2x = 2... (3)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 1... (4)

So Adam has 1 apple, and Jackie has 1 + 4 = 5 apples."
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them, so we can start by finding out how many apples each of them has individually. If they have 7 apples in total, then each of them must have 7/2 = 3 apples. Now, if Adam has 3 apples and Jackie also has 3 apples, then together they have 3 + 3 = 6 apples. So, there are 6 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 12 apples. If Adam has 9 more than what they have together, then he must have 9 + 12 = 21 apples. And if Adam has 8 more than Jackie, then Jackie has 12 - 8 = 4 apples. So, Adam has 21 apples and Jackie has 4 apples.
Response:  We know that together, Adam and Jackie have 2 apples. If they had only one apple each, they would still have two apples in total. Therefore, we can conclude that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie. Since Jackie has 10 apples, Adam must have 10 + 3 = 13 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has 5 more pommes than Jackie. So if Jackie has x pommes, then Adam has x + 5 pommes. We also know that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 pommes. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (x + 5) = 89 + 11

Combine like terms:

2x + 5 = 100

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2x = 95

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 47.5

So Jackie has 47.5 pommes. Since Adam has 5 more pommes than Jackie, Adam has:

Adam has 47.5 + 5 = 52 pommes."
"Response:  We know that Hélène has made 31 cookies yesterday, 270 cookies this morning and 419 cookies before yesterday. To find out how many cookies she has made in total until yesterday evening, we need to add all these numbers together. Can you do that for me? Sure! Here's the calculation:
31 + 270 + 419 = 720 cookies.
So, Hélène has made 720 cookies until yesterday evening."
"Response:  We know that Hélène has made 90 + 51 = 141 cookies in total. Of those, she made 484 cookies aux pépites de chocolat this morning. So, we can subtract the number of cookies she made yesterday from the total number of cookies she made today to find out how many cookies she made yesterday:  
141 - 90 = 51 cookies aux pépites de chocolat. 
Therefore, Hélène has made 51 cookies aux pépites de chocolat."
"Response:  We know that Hélène has made 527 + 86 = 613 cookies in total. And we also know that she has made 554 cookies with pepitas this morning. So if we subtract the number of cookies she made this morning from the total number of cookies she has made, we get:  
613 - 554 = 59 cookies with pepitas."
Response:  We know that Hélène has made 144 + 397 = 541 cookies in total. She has also made 85 cookies aux raisins this morning, so she has made 541 - 85 = 456 cookies without raisins. Therefore, Hélène has made 397 cookies aux raisins.
"Response:  We know that Hélène has made 237 cookies aux pépites de chocolat this morning and she had already made 19 cookies aux pépites de chocolat yesterday. So in total, Hélène has made 237 + 19 = 256 cookies aux pépites de chocolat. Now we need to find out how many more cookies aux pépites de chocolat Hélène has made compared to cookies aux raisins secs. To do this, we can subtract the number of cookies aux raisins secs from the total number of cookies aux pépites de chocolat:  
256 - 231 = 25. Therefore, Hélène has made 25 more cookies aux pépites de chocolat than cookies aux raisins secs."
Response:  We know that yesterday, Hélène made 197 cookies aux pépites de chocolat and today she has made 75 cookies aux raisins + 66 cookies aux pépites de chocolat = 131 cookies aux pépites de chocolat (total). So, yesterday she made 197 - 131 = 66 more cookies aux pépites de chocolat than today.
"Response:  We know that yesterday, Hélène made 300 cookies aux raisins and today she has made 280 cookies aux raisins. So, how many more cookies did she make yesterday than today? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cookies she made today from the number of cookies she made yesterday.  
300 - 280 = 20. Therefore, Hélène made 20 more cookies aux raisins yesterday than she did today."
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games she has:  
81 - 59 = 22 
So, Katie has 22 more games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. And her old friends have 53 games, so in total, Katie and her friends have 179 + 53 = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
"Response:  First, we need to find out how many new games Katie has. We know that she had 84 new games. Next, we need to find out how many old games she has. We know that she has 19 old games. So, if we subtract the number of old games from the total number of games, we will get the number of new games. Here is the calculation:  
Total Games = New Games + Old Games 
New Games = Total Games - Old Games 
New Games = 84 + 19 
New Games = 103 
So, Katie has 103 new games. Now let's calculate the number of new games her friends have. We know that they have 8 new games and 69 old games. So, if we subtract the number of old games from the total number of games, we will get the number of new games. Here is the calculation:  
Total Games = New Games + Old Games 
New Games = Total Games - Old Games 
New Games = 8 + 69 
New Games = 77 
So, together, Katie and her friends have 103 + 77 = 180 new games."
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  If Katie has 63 games and her friends have 57 games, then she has 63 - 57 = 7 more games than her friends. So, Katie has 7 more games than her friends.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games for a total of 57 + 39 = 96 games. Her friends have 34 new games. So we can compare the number of games they both have:  
Katie has 96 games - 34 games (her friends') = 62 more games than her friends."
"Response:  First, we know that Jason had $19 at the beginning of the weekend and he earned some amount while washing cars. So, his total earnings can be represented as:

Jason's Total Earnings = $19 + (amount earned)

We also know that after washing cars, Jason has $33. Therefore, we can set up an equation to find out how much he earned:

$33 - $19 = Amount Earned

Solving for the amount earned, we get:

$14 = Amount Earned

So, Jason earned $14 by washing cars during the weekend."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $86 and Jason had $5. Then, Fred made $9 from washing cars, so he has $86 + $9 = $95 now. Since Jason didn't work, he still only has $5. Therefore, together they have $95 + $5 = $100.
"Response:  We know that Fred had $19 and Jason had $16 at the beginning of the weekend. After washing cars, Fred has $40 now and Jason has $69. So we can calculate how much each of them earned during the weekend as follows:

Fred's earnings = $40 - $19 = $21
Jason's earnings = $69 - $16 = $53

Therefore, Fred gained $21 during the weekend, and Jason gained $53."
"Response:  We know that Fred had $114 and Jason had $22 at first. Then we are told that they washed cars over the weekend. So let's subtract what each of them had before from what they have now to find out how much they made:
Fred went from having $114 to having $21, so he lost $93 ($114 - $21).
Jason went from having $22 to having $78, so he gained $56 ($22 + $78).
Therefore, Jason earned $56 during the weekend."
Response:  We know that Fred had $111 and now he has $115, so he gained $4. And we also know that Jason had $40 and now he has $44, so he gained $4 as well. Therefore, they both gained $4 each from washing cars.
"Response:  We know that Fred had $49 and Jason had $3 at first. Then we are told that Fred made money washing cars and now has $112. So let's subtract what he started with from his new amount to find out how much he made:
$112 - $49 = $63
Now, we need to figure out how much Jason made delivering newspapers. We know that he started with $3 and now has $63. So again, let's subtract what he started with from his new amount to find out how much he made:
$63 - $3 = $60
Therefore, Fred made $63 and Jason made $60 delivering newspapers."
"Response:  First, we know that Jason had $31 and then he delivered newspapers and earned $14 more. So, his new amount is:

$31 + $14 = $45

Now, let's find out how much Fred gained from washing cars over the weekend. We know that he started with $78 and now has $90. So, he gained:

$90 - $78 = $12

Since both of them gained money, our total gain is the sum of their individual gains:

$12 + $45 = $57

Therefore, they gained $57 in delivering newspapers and washing cars."
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $33 before the weekend started. Then he made $16 delivering newspapers and another $74 washing cars for a total of $90. So, Fred earned $90 during the weekend.
Response:  First, we know that Fred had $47 before the weekend. Then he made $111 delivering newspapers and $34 washing cars for a total of $145. So now Fred has $47 + $145 = $192.
"Response:  If she weighed 71 kg initially and lost 20 kg after starting to run every day, then her current weight would be:

71 - 20 = 51 kg

So, Jessie now weighs 51 kg."
"Response:  We know that Jessie lost 101 kg after starting to run every day. To find out how much she weighed before starting her running routine, we can subtract 101 kg from her current weight of 27 kg. So...

Jessie weighed 38 kg (27 kg - 101 kg) before starting to run every day."
"Response:  We know that Jessie lost 126 kg and now weighs 66 kg. To find out how much she weighed before starting her jogging routine, we can subtract 66 kg from 126 kg.  
So, Jessie weighed 60 kg (126 kg - 66 kg) before starting to jog every day."
"Response:  If Jessie weighed 69 kg before starting to run every day and lost 35 kg, then she currently weighs... (wait for it)... 34 kg! That's right; after losing 35 kg, she now weighs 34 kg."
"Response:  If she lost 50 kg in the first week and then another 60 kg in the second week, we can calculate her current weight as follows:

Jessie's initial weight = 114 kg
Weight loss in first week = 50 kg
New weight after first week = 114 - 50 = 64 kg
Weight loss in second week = 60 kg
New weight after second week = 64 - 60 = 4 kg

Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 4 kg."
"Response:  We know that Jessie lost 62 kg in the first week and then another 140 kg in the second week. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get:  
62 + 140 = 202 kg  
Jessie lost a total of 202 kg. Now, let's divide this number by 2 to find out how much she weighed before starting her jogging routine:  
202 / 2 = 101 kg  
So, Jessie weighed 101 kg before beginning her jogging routine."
"Response:  We know that Jessie lost 56 kg in the first week and then she lost an additional 99 kg in the second week. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get:  
56 + 99 = 155 kg  
So, after the first week of jogging, Jessie weighed 155 kg."
"Response:  We know that there are 95 serpents in total and 64 of them are hiding. So, we can find out how many serpents are not hiding by subtracting 64 from 95:

95 - 64 =?

Do you want to try to solve this problem?"
"Response:  We know that there are 97 alligators in total and 40 of them are hiding. So, we can find out how many alligators are not hiding by subtracting 40 from 97.  
97 - 40 =? 
Can you solve this subtraction problem?"
"Response:  We know that there are 3 serpents and 75 alligators in total in the cage. If 82 serpents and 19 alligators were hiding, then we can subtract them from the total to find out how many alligators weren't hiding.  
So, if 82 serpents and 19 alligators were hiding, then the number of alligators not hiding would be:  
Total - (82 + 19) = Total - 101 = 75 - 101 = -26  
Since the number of alligators cannot be negative, we can conclude that no alligators were not hiding. All 75 alligators were hiding."
Response:  We know that there are 24 serpents and 51 alligators in the cage, so together they make up 24 + 51 = 75 animals. Since we were told that the total number of animals in the cage is 79, this means that there must be 79 - 75 = 4 animals that do not hide themselves.
Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes in his garden to start with. Yesterday, he picked 134 of them, leaving him with 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes. Today, he picked another 30, so now he has 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes left.
Response:  If the farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden and he picked 56 yesterday, then he has 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left. And if he picked 41 today, then he has 104 - 41 = 63 tomatoes left after both days of picking.
Response:  We know that yesterday he picked 154 tomatoes and today he picked 50. So in total, he has picked 154 + 50 = 204 tomatoes.
"Response:  If he has harvested 172 potatoes, then he has 77 - 172 = 0 potatoes left. And if he has 0 potatoes left, that means all of them have been harvested. So, he has no more potatoes left. Now, let's check how many tomatoes are left. He had 175 tomatoes and he did not harvest any, so he still has 175 tomatoes left. Therefore, the numeric answer is:

Tomatoes: 175
Potatoes: 0"
Response:  If the farmer had 177 tomatoes and he picked 53 of them, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. He also had 12 potatoes before picking any tomatoes, so he still has 12 potatoes. Therefore, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left after picking 53 tomatoes.
"Response:  We know that the farmer had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes for a total of 176 tomatoes. If he picked 137 tomatoes, then how many tomatoes does he have left?  
To find out, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had:  
176 - 137 = 39  
So, the farmer has 39 tomatoes left in his garden."
Response:  If each planche of wood needs two nails to be fixed, and four nails are used in total for the wall of the house, then we can conclude that John will need twice as many planches of wood as there are nails. Therefore, he will need 8 planches of wood (2 x 4 = 8).
"Response:  We know that there are 13 large wooden planks to be used for the walls of the house and each plank requires 17 nails to be fixed. So, we need to calculate how many nails will be required in total. 
Total number of nails = Number of planks x Number of nails per plank 
= 13 x 17 
= 221 nails 
In addition to this, we also have to use 8 nails for some smaller planks. Therefore, the total number of nails required can be calculated as follows: 
Total number of nails = Total number of nails for large planks + Number of nails for small planks 
= 221 + 8 
= 229 nails
Therefore, John needs 229 nails to build the wall of his house."
"Response:  We know that each planche requires 3 clous to be fixed and there are 8 additional clous used for other purposes. So, in total, we have 3 x (number of planches) + 8 = 11. Solving for the number of planches, we get: 
3x + 8 = 11
3x = 11 - 8
3x = 3
x = 3/3
x = 1
So, John needs 1 planche for the wall of his house."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 large boards and 10 small boards in total. The number of nails required for each board is given as follows:

* Large boards require 15 nails (12 x 15 = 180)
* Small boards require 5 nails (10 x 5 = 50)

Therefore, the total number of nails required to build the wall of the house is:

180 + 50 = 230

So, John needs 230 nails to build the wall of his house."
"Response:  If John needs 16 planches for the wall of his house and each planche requires 2 clous to be fixed, then he will need in total :  
16 x 2 = 32 clous. 
So, John has to buy 32 clous to build the wall of his house."
"Response:  We know that each plank needs 74 nails to be fixed, so we need to calculate how many planks are needed for the wall of the house. To do this, we divide the total length of the wall by the length of one plank. If the wall is 10 meters long and each plank is 2 meters long, then we can calculate as follows:  
10 meters (wall length) / 2 meters (plank length) = 5 planks 
So, John will need 5 planks for the wall of his house."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 large wooden boards and 17 small wooden boards in total. To calculate how many boards John needs for the wall of the house, we need to find out how many boards he will use for each type of board. 
For the large wooden boards, we know that each one requires 14 nails. So if we multiply 12 (large wooden boards) x 14 (nails per board), we get:
12 x 14 = 168 nails needed for large wooden boards
Now let's do the same calculation for the small wooden boards. Each small wooden board requires 25 nails, so if we multiply 17 (small wooden boards) x 25 (nails per board), we get:
17 x 25 = 425 nails needed for small wooden boards
In total, John needs:
168 + 425 = 693 nails
Therefore, John needs 693 nails to build the wall of his house."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of gum in each pack and a total of 42 pieces. So we can start by multiplying 42 by 3 to get the number of packs:  
42 x 3 = 126 
Therefore, Robin has 126 packs of gum."
Response:  If Robin has 43 packages of gum and each package contains 23 pieces, then she has a total of 43 x 23 = 961 pieces of gum. However, we are also told that Robin has 8 additional pieces of gum. Therefore, her total number of pieces of gum is 961 + 8 = 969. So, Robin has 969 pieces of chewing gum.
"Response:  We know that each pack of gum has 7 pieces and Robin has 6 extra pieces. So if we add 6 to 7, we get 13. Therefore, Robin has 13 pieces of gum in total. Since there are 7 pieces per pack, we can divide 13 by 7 to find out how many packs Robin has:  
13 / 7 = 2
So Robin has 2 packs of gum."
"Response:  We know that there are 28 packs of gum and each pack has 4 pieces. So we can start by multiplying 28 x 4 to get our total number of pieces of gum:  
28 x 4 = 112 
Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of chewing gum."
"Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packs of gum and each pack contains 9 pieces. So, Robin has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. 
Now, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Robin has. Since there are 45 packs of candies and each pack contains 9 pieces, Robin has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy."
"Response:  We know that each pack of gum contains 6 pieces and there are 28 packs of gum in total. So we can calculate how many pieces of gum Robin has as follows:  
28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum  
Now let's consider the bonbons. Each pack of bonbons also contains 6 pieces and there are 14 packs of bonbons in total. Therefore, we can calculate how many pieces of candy Robin has as follows:  
14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy  
So altogether, Robin has 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of gum and candy."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 3 chemises per minute and it has produced 6 chemises in total. So we need to find out how many minutes the machine worked. 
We can start with this equation:
6 = 3 x m
where ""m"" is the number of minutes the machine worked.
Solving for ""m"", we get:
m = 2
So the machine worked for 2 minutes."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 4 chemises per minute. If it has operated for 5 minutes, we need to multiply the number of chemises produced per minute by the time the machine was in operation. So, if the machine produces 4 chemises per minute and operates for 5 minutes, then it will have produced:  
4 chemises/minute x 5 minutes = 20 chemises."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 3 chemises per minute and it produced 9 chemises yesterday in one day. So we can calculate how many minutes the machine worked as follows:  
9 chemises / 3 chemises/minute = 3 minutes 
Therefore, the machine worked for 3 minutes yesterday."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 8 chemises per minute and it produced 13 chemises yesterday (which is equal to 13 x 60 = 780 seconds) and 3 chemises today (which is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 seconds). Therefore, we need to add up these two amounts of time to find out how many minutes the machine worked in total. So, the total number of minutes the machine worked is:  
780 + 180 = 960 minutes."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 2 chemises per minute and it produced 8 chemises today. So we need to divide 8 by 2 to find out how many minutes the machine worked today.  
8 / 2 = 4 
So the machine worked for 4 minutes today."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 3 chemises per minute. If it produced 4 chemises yesterday and 8 chemises today, we need to find out how many minutes it worked in total.

Yesterday, the machine produced 4 chemises in 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the machine worked for 1 hour yesterday.

Today, the machine produced 8 chemises in 2 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, the machine worked for 2 hours today.

In total, the machine worked for 1 + 2 = 3 hours. Therefore, the machine worked for 3 hours in total."
"Response:  We know that the machine can produce 6 chemises per minute and it worked for 12 minutes yesterday (yesterday is already past). So, we can calculate how many chemises were produced yesterday as follows:  
Yesterday = 12 minutes x 6 chemises/minute = 72 chemises  
Today, the machine has worked for 12 minutes so far and produced 14 chemises. Therefore, we can add the number of chemises produced today to the total number of chemises produced yesterday:  
Total = 72 chemises + 14 chemises = 86 chemises 
So, the machine has produced a total of 86 chemises."
Response:  We know that the machine can produce 6 chemises per minute and it worked for 5 minutes yesterday, so it produced 6 x 5 = 30 chemises yesterday. Today, it has worked for 1 minute and produced 6 x 1 = 6 chemises today. Therefore, in total, the machine has produced 30 + 6 = 36 chemises today.
"Response:  We know that they have earned $165 in total over 5 days. So, we can calculate how much they have earned each day by dividing the total amount by the number of days.

$165 / 5 = $33 per day

So, they have earned $33 per day."
"Response:  We know that they earned $144 per day and were at the fair for 22 days. So we can calculate their total earnings as follows:

Total Earnings = Daily Earning x Number of Days
= $144 x 22
= $3,068

Therefore, they have earned $3,068 during the 22 days they spent at the fair."
"Response:  We know that in total they have earned $420 + 22 = 442 dollars. And we also know that the game of throwing rings has brought them the same amount every day, so if we divide the total earnings by the number of days, we will find out how much they have earned per day.

$442 / 30 = $14.73 per day

So, the game of throwing rings has brought them $14.73 per day."
"Response:  We know that they earned $382 in the first 44 days and $374 in the last 10 days. To find out how much they earned in total, we need to add these two amounts together. So, our calculation is as follows:

$382 + $374 = $756

Therefore, they earned a total of $756 at the fairground game stall."
"Response:  We know that they earned $120 in total during the first 20 days and $66 during the last 16 days. So we can calculate how much they earned each day as follows:

Total earnings = $120 + $66 = $186

Number of days = 20 + 16 = 36 days

Daily earnings = Total earnings / Number of days = $186 / 36 = $5.11 per day (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, they earned $5.11 per day during the first 20 days at the fair."
"Response:  We know that they earned $325 in the first 154 days and $114 in the last 57 days. To find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days, we need to add up all of these amounts and divide by the number of days. So, let's do this:

$325 + $114 = $439

Now, let's divide by the number of days:

$439 ÷ 57 = $7.68 per day

So, they earned $7.68 per day during the last 57 days of the fair."
"Response:  We know that Lucy has bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cake. To find out how many more packets of biscuits she has bought than cakes, we need to subtract the number of packs of cakes from the number of packs of biscuits. So, if we subtract 4 from 10, we get:

10 - 4 = 6

Therefore, Lucy has bought 6 more packs of biscuits than cakes."
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 4 packs of biscuits, and each pack contains how many biscuits? Hmm...let me see...oh yes! Each pack has 5 biscuits, so Lucy bought 4 x 5 = 20 biscuits.  
Now, let's move on to the gâteaux. Lucy bought 22 packs of gâteaux, and each pack contains how many gâteaux? Oh dear, I forget again! But wait, it says here that each pack has 3 gâteaux, so Lucy bought 22 x 3 = 66 gâteaux.  
Finally, we have the chocolate. Lucy bought 16 packs of chocolate, and each pack contains how many pieces of chocolate? Hmm...I remember now! Each pack has 8 pieces of chocolate, so Lucy bought 16 x 8 = 128 pieces of chocolate.  
So, in total, Lucy bought 20 + 66 + 128 = 214 items from the supermarket."
"Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 packs of biscuits and some packets of cake. If we add 23 to however many packets of cake she bought, we get our total number of packages. So let's start with 23 + x, where x is the number of packets of cake she bought. We are also given that the total number of packages was 27. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  
23 + x = 27 
Solving for x gives us: 
x = 4 
Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packets of cake in addition to the 23 packs of biscuits."
"Response:  We know that Lucy had $56$ units of money remaining after buying groceries. She bought $2$ packets of biscuits and $12$ packets of cakes. The cost of each packet of biscuits is $\$2$, so she spent $\$4$ on biscuits in total. Each packet of cakes costs $\$3$, so she spent $\$36$ on cakes in total. In total, Lucy spent $\$40$. Since she had $\$56$ left over, we can set up the equation:

$$40 = 56 - x$$

where $x$ represents the amount Lucy spent on other items at the supermarket. Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 6$$

So Lucy spent an additional $\$6$ on other items at the supermarket. Therefore, the total number of packets of groceries Lucy purchased is:

$$2 + 12 = 14$$

Therefore, Lucy purchased $14$ packets of groceries in total."
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 people in the bus and then 4 more got on at the next stop. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. But we also know that each bus can only hold up to 36 people, so we need to subtract 16 from 36 to find out how many people are currently in the bus.  36 - 16 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 people in the bus right now.
Response:  We know that there were 8 people in the bus initially and then 12 more people boarded the bus at the next stop. So, the total number of people now in the bus is 8 + 12 = 20. Additionally, we are told that 3 people got off the bus, so the final number of people left in the bus is 20 - 3 = 17. Therefore, there are currently 17 people in the bus.
Response:  If there were initially 4 people in the bus and 13 more got on at the next stop, then there are now 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially 11 people in the train and then 8 more got in at the next stop. So, if we add 8 to 11, we get... (pause for dramatic effect)...29! Yes, there are now 29 people in the train.
"Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and a total of 676 people. To find out how many students were present in the program, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, if we subtract 22 from 676, we get:  
676 - 22 = 654. 
Therefore, there were 654 students present in the program."
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents, and each parent had at least one child (since they are in the program). So we can start by adding up all the children: 724 students x 1 parent per student = 724 parents. Now let's add the teachers: 744 teachers + 724 parents = 1468 people present in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students. To find out how many more students than parents were present, we can subtract the number of parents from the total number of students. So...

521 - 174 =...?

Do you see it? There are 347 more students than parents in the program!"
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total. If we add these two numbers together, we get 238 people (61 + 177). However, the program could only accommodate 44 people. So, if we subtract 238 from 44, we get 194 (238 - 44). Therefore, there were 194 people present in the program.
"Response:  We know that they have to cover 1307 feet in total and the depth of the cave is 919 feet. So we can subtract 919 from 1307 to get the remaining distance:  
1307 - 919 = 388 feet."
Response:  We know that they are already at 849 feet and need to go an additional 370 feet (1218 - 849) to reach the end of the cave. Since they move at a speed of 17 feet per minute, it will take them approximately 21 minutes (370 / 17) to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that they are already at 659 feet and the depth of the cave is 762 feet. So if we subtract 659 from 762, we get 93. Therefore, there are 93 feet left to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 red fish in the pond and now there are only 6 left. This means that 2 red fish have disappeared or been eaten.  
"Response:  We know that Paige had 7 red fish and 12 catfish in her pond initially. The cats have eaten some of them, so we need to find out how many are left. If we subtract the number of catfish from the total number of fish, we get:  
7 (red fish) + 12 (catfish) = 19  
If Paige has 15 fish remaining, we can set up an equation:  
19 - x = 15  
Where ""x"" is the number of fish that have disappeared. Solving for ""x"", we get:  
x = 4  
So, 4 fish have disappeared or been eaten by the cats."
"Response:  We know that Paige had 16 red fish and 71 catfish in her pond initially. If the stray cats ate many of them, then we can assume that some of the red fish were also eaten. So, if we subtract the number of catfish from the total number of fish, we will get the remaining red fish.

Total number of fish = 16 (red fish) + 71 (catfish) = 87

Now, let's subtract the number of catfish from the total number of fish to find out how many red fish are left:

Remaining red fish = Total number of fish - Number of catfish
= 87 - 71
= 16

Therefore, 16 red fish have disappeared or been eaten by the stray cats."
Response:  If Paige raised 15 fish and 5 were eaten by cats, then there are 15 - 5 = 10 fish left in the pond.
"Response:  We know that the chef had 43 apples at first and he used some of them to make tarts. He has 2 apples left now. So we can set up an equation based on this information:

Let x be the number of apples the chef used to make tarts.

We know that the chef started with 43 apples, so the equation becomes:

43 - x = 2 (since he has 2 apples left)

Now solve for x. In other words, find out how many apples the chef used to make tarts.

Solution: To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 43 from both sides of the equation:

43 - x = 2

Subtracting 43 from both sides gives us:

x = 41

So the chef used 41 apples to make tarts!"
Response:  The chef had 58 apples and used 35 to make tarts. That means he has 23 apples left (58 - 35 = 23).
"Response:  The chef had 40 apples and made some tarts. After making the tarts, he had 39 apples left. So, to find out how many apples he used, we can subtract the number of apples he had after making the tarts from the total number of apples he had initially. In this case, that would be:  

40 - 39 = 1 apple. 
So, the chef used 1 apple to make his tarts."
Response:  We know that each shelf can hold 11 action figures and there are 4 shelves in total. So if we multiply 11 x 4, we get 44 action figures per shelf. Since there are 4 shelves, the total number of action figures that Adam's room could contain is 44 x 4 = 176 action figures.
"Response:  We know that each shelf can hold 10 action figures and Adam had 8 action figures in his room. So we need to find out how many shelves he would need to display all of them.  
We can start with the number of action figures he has (8) and divide it by the number of action figures per shelf (10):
8 / 10 = 0 remainder 2
So, Adam needs 2 shelves to display all of his action figures. Therefore, there are 2 shelves in Adam's room."
Response:  Each shelf can hold 8 action figures and 10 armories, so each shelf can hold 8 x 10 = 80 objects in total. Since there are 4 shelves, the total number of objects that all 4 shelves could hold is 4 x 80 = 320 objects.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens with 544 pots in each garden. So, if we multiply 10 x 544, we get 5440 pots in total. Now, we need to find out how many flowers are in all these pots. Since each pot contains 32 flowers, we can simply multiply 5440 by 32 to get our final answer of 172800 flowers!
"Response:  We know that there are 466 pots in total and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. So we can start by calculating how many flowers and sticks there are in total for all the pots combined. 
To do this, we need to multiply the number of pots (466) by the number of flowers per pot (53) and the number of sticks per pot (181). This gives us: 
Flowers: 466 x 53 = 24,978 
Sticks: 466 x 181 = 83,036 
So there are 24,978 flowers and 83,036 sticks in total."
"Response:  We know that each pot contains 71 flowers and 91 sticks. So if we multiply 141 (the number of pots) by 71 (the number of flowers in each pot), we get:  
141 x 71 = 10,011 flowers. 
Therefore, there are 10,011 flowers in total."
"Response:  We know that each pot contains 40 flowers and there is a total of 400 flowers. So we can start by multiplying the number of flowers in one pot (40) by the total number of pots needed to hold all the flowers (x). This gives us:

40 x = 400

Now we need to solve for x, which represents the number of pots. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 40:

x = 400 / 40

x = 10

So there are 10 pots containing 40 flowers each, for a total of 400 flowers."
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles in total and 4276 gummies. So we can start by finding out how many groups of each type there will be if they are divided equally.  
To find out how many groups of Skittles there will be, divide 4502 by 154 (the number of groups):
4502 / 154 = 29
So, there will be 29 groups of Skittles.  
Now, let's find out how many groups of gummies there will be:
4276 / 154 = 28
So, there will be 28 groups of gummies.  
Since both types of candies need to be divided into the same number of groups, we can say that there will be 29 + 28 = 57 groups in total."
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in total and Steven has 4950 gummies. So if we divide the number of Skittles by the number of gummies, we get approximately 0.79 groups of gummies for each Skittle. Since there are 495 groups in total, each group would have approximately 79 gummies.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in total and they are divided into 8 groups. So each group has to have 896/8 = 112 Skittles.
"Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So we can start by dividing 270 by 5 to find out how many classes we need:  
270 / 5 = 54  
So, there will be 54 classes with 5 students in each class."
"Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So we can start by multiplying 304 x 75 to find out how many students there were in total.  
304 x 75 = 22,900 
Therefore, there were 22,900 students at the school."
