Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played with 18 players. On Tuesday (tirsdag), she played with 10 players. So, Julia played more matches on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between these two numbers is: 18 - 10 = 8. Therefore, Julia played 8 more matches on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played tennis with 11 boys. So she played with 12 people in total - herself and the 11 boys.  Therefore, there were more games played on Tuesday (tirsdag) than on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played tennis with five other people on Tuesday, then she must have played with at least six people in total (including herself). So, if she played with 15 people, she would have played with many more than just six!
Response:  If Julia played tennis with 9 players on Monday and 14 players on Tuesday, then if she played with 16 players, how many games would she play in total? So, the answer is 9 + 14 = 23 games.
Response:  If Julia played tennis with 16 balls on Monday and she plays with 12 balls on Tuesday, then many balls will play with her on Wednesday. So, the answer is 4 (Wednesday - the day after Tuesday).
"Response:  If Julia played tug of war with 14 boys on Tuesday, and she played with eight other boys on Monday, then the total number of boys she played with is:
Tuesday + Monday = 14 + 8 = 22
Therefore, the answer is 22."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 17 balls. On Tuesday, she played with 20 balls. So, in total, Julia played with 37 balls (17 + 20). Therefore, the correct answer is 37.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday, she played with 97 children. So, if many children want to play with her on Monday and Tuesday, we can say that... (give your answer)
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with five children. On Tuesday, she played with nine children. And on Wednesday, she played with 15 children. So, if many children want to play with her on Monday and Wednesday, then the answer is 9 + 15 = 24.
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with two children. If we assume that each child represents one ""born,"" then Julia played with two born on Monday. Now, let's move on to Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, Julia played with 14 children, which means she played with 14 born. Similarly, on Wednesday, she played with 16 children, which means she played with 16 born. So, in total, Julia played with 20 born (14 + 16). Therefore, the correct answer is 20."
"Response:  On Monday (spelled ""m√•ndag"" in Norwegian), Julia played with nine children at 7 PM. On Tuesday (spelled ""tirsdag""), she played with 48 children at 3 PM. And on Wednesday (spelled ""onsdag""), she played with 96 children at 10 AM. So, we can see that Julia played more games with many more children on Wednesday than she did on either Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Yes, Julia played many more games with many more children on Wednesday than she did on either Monday or Tuesday."
Response:  If Julia played tennis with 14 people on Monday and 8 people on Wednesday, then there are more people who did not like playing tennis on Monday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is 7 (the difference between 14 and 8).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with eight children. On Tuesday, she played with eleven children. And on Wednesday, she played with nine children. So, if many more games did Julia have on Tuesday than on Wednesday, we can say that... (continued)  Therefore, the correct answer is: Yes, Julia had more games on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Julia played with 15 children each day. On Wednesday, she played with 7 children. So in total, Julia played with 15 + 15 = 30 children during the weekdays (Monday to Wednesday).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 cards and on Tuesday she played with 10 cards. If we add these numbers together, we get 23. Then, in today's game, Julia played with 15 cards. So, the number of cards played with Julia is greater than 23. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) More than 23.
Response:  If Julia played cards with seven boys on Monday and thirteen on Tuesday, then she played cards with a total of 20 boys in one day. So, many boys did Julia play cards with?  Answer: 20
Response:  On Monday (dag 1), Julia played tennis with 12 balls. On Tuesday (dag 2), she played table tennis with 14 balls. She spent 34 hours playing with him every day. So, how many balls did she play with in total?  Total number of balls = Number of balls played on Monday + Number of balls played on Tuesday = 12 + 14 = 26 balls. Therefore, Julia played with 26 balls in total.
Response:  We know that Julia played tennis with 19 other players on Monday. She spent 38 hours playing with all of them. So, how many more games did she play on Monday than on Tuesday?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of hours she spent playing with 18 other players (on Tuesday) from the total number of hours she spent playing with all her opponents (Monday):  Total hours playing with all opponents = 38 hours  Number of hours playing with 18 other players = 38 - 18 = 20 hours  Therefore, Julia played 20 more games on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (mandag), Julia played with five other people. If she had six balls on Monday, then she must have had fewer than six balls on Tuesday (tirsdag). So, the number of games Julia played on Tuesday is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  On Monday, she played with four children. On Tuesday, she played with more than four but fewer than eight children. Therefore, there will be between 4 and 7 children playing with her on Thursday.
Response:  Julia played tennis with 4 people on Wednesday. She had 6 players play on Monday and 17 on Tuesday. Can many more children play tennis as they don't like Monday?
Response:  If Bobby ate 25 pieces of candy and then ate 43 more, he would have eaten in total 68 pieces of candy (25 + 43).
Response:  Bobby had 28 pieces of candy and he ate 42 more. So, in total, Bobby ate 60 pieces of candy (28 + 42). Then, he also ate 63 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total number of sweet treats that Bobby ate is 60 + 63 = 123.
Response:  Bobby ate 33 pieces of candy and 4 of them were chocolate. He also ate 14 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Bobby had eaten:  Chocolate candies = 4 x 33 = 132 Chocolate cookie bits = 14 x 0.5 = 7 chocolate chip cookies Total number of sweets eaten by Bobby = 132 + 7 = 139
Response:  Bobby ate 38 sweets in total. He ate 36 of them. So he had 36 + 16 = 52 sweets in total. Therefore, Bobby has had 52 chocolate bars.
Response:  Bobby had 20 apples and gave away 34 to someone else. Then he gave away 18 more apples. So, how many apples does Bobby have left? We can use subtraction to find out!  Subtracting 34 from 20 gives us 14. And then subtracting 18 from 14 gives us 6. So, Bobby has 6 apples left.
Response:  If Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 of them, then he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left.  Then, if he ate 9 more pieces of candy, he would have 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left. So, there are 7 pieces of candy left after Bobby ate both batches of candies.
Response:  Bobby initially had 22 lollipops and he ate some of them. We don't know how many he ate, but let's assume it was 3 (just for simplicity). So now he has 22 - 3 = 19 lollipops left. Then he ate 5 more lollipops, so he has 19 - 5 = 14 lollipops left. Therefore, Bobby had 14 lollipops in total.
Response:  If Bobby has 19 slippers and he eats two bowls of soup, then we can calculate how many slippers are left.  We know that one bowl of soup contains 2 spoons, so if Bobby eats two bowls of soup, he will have consumed 4 spoons (2 x 2 = 4). Now, let's see how many slippers are left after consuming 4 spoons of soup.  If Bobby has 19 slippers and he consumes 4 spoons of soup, then he will have 15 slippers left (19 - 4 = 15). So, the answer is 15.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them, then he will have less than 32 pieces left. We don't know how many pieces of candy he actually ate, but let's assume that he ate half of his remaining candy, which is 16 pieces (half of 32). So now he has 16 pieces of candy left.  Therefore, if he has 20 pieces of candy left after eating some of his original candy, we can deduce that he must have eaten 4 pieces of candy initially (20 - 16 = 4).
Response:  If Bobby initially had 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17 pieces, then he had 36 - 17 = 19 remaining pieces of candy.  Then, if he ate another 15 pieces, he would have 19 - 15 = 4 remaining pieces of candy. So, in total, Bobby had 4 pieces of candy after eating both batches.
Response:  If Bobby initially had 30 pieces of candy and then ate 23 pieces, he must have started with more than 30 pieces. So, the number of candies Bobby had in the beginning is: 30 - 23 = 7.
Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons in the park. So, altogether they have 5 + 3 = 8 balloons. Therefore, the correct answer is 8.
Response:  If Allan has two balloons and Jake has three balls in the park, then we can say that Jake has 3 - 2 = 1 more balloon than Allan. So, Jake has one extra balloon at the garden.
Response:  If Allan has 2 balls and Jake has 3 balls, then together they have 5 balls (Allan + Jake). So if Allan had only 2 balls, Jake would have 0 balls.
Response:  If Jake has 6 balloons with him and Allan has 4 balloons, then together they have 6 + 4 = 10 balloons. So, Jake had many more balloons than Allan.
Response:  If Allan has five balloons and Jake has six balloons more than Allan, then Jake has 6 + 5 = 11 balloons in total.
Response:  We know that Allan initially had 3 balloons and Jake had 5 balloons in the park. Then, Allan bought 2 more balloons. So, now Allan has 3 + 2 = 5 balloons in the park. Similarly, Jake still has 5 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Allan and Jake have in the park is 5 (Allan) + 5 (Jake) = 10 balloons.
Response:  We know that Allan initially had 2 balloons and then he bought 3 more. So, in total, Allan has 5 balloons (2 + 3) in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan has 3 more balloons than Jake in the park. So if Jake had x balloons initially, then Allan has 3 + x balloons now. Since Allan bought 3 additional balloons, we can say that he now has 3 + x + 3 = total number of balloons in the park. Now, we are given that Jake had 6 balloons initially, so we can substitute this value for x in our equation: 3 + x + 3 = 6. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, Jake had 3 balloons at first.
Response:  At first, Allan has 5 balls and Jake has 4 balls in the park. So together they have 9 balls (5 + 4). Then Allan buys 3 more balls to add to his collection. Now he has 8 balls (5 + 3), and Jake still has 4 balls. Therefore, Allan has 8 balls in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan initially had 6 balloons and then bought 2 more (for a total of 8). Then, Jake bought 3 additional balloons in the park, bringing the total number of balloons in the park to 11 (8 + 3). So, the correct answer is 11.
Response:  Allan has 6 balls and Jake has 3 balls initially. Then, Jake buys 4 more balls in the park. So, now Jake has 7 balls (3 + 4). Therefore, the correct answer is 7.
"Response:  We know that Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 6 balloons initially. Then, Jake buys 3 more balloons in the park. So, we need to find out how many balloons Jake now has.  To do this, we can use the information given in the question: ""Jake k√∏pte 3 ballonger til i parken."" This means that Jake bought 3 additional balloons in the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons Jake now has is:  Initially, Jake had 6 balloons + 3 new balloons = 9 balloons.  So, the correct answer is 9."
Response:  If Alan brought 3 balls and 20 balloons to the park, that means he has a total of 23 objects (3 balls + 20 balloons). Similarly, if Jake took 5 balls and 59 balloons to the park, that means he has a total of 64 objects (5 balls + 59 balloons). So, the difference between the number of objects brought by Alan and Jake is: 64 - 23 = 41. Therefore, the correct answer is 41.
Response:  We know that Alan has 7 balloons and 5 balls, so he has a total of 12 objects (7 balloons + 5 balls). Similarly, we know that Jake has 6 balloons and 4 balls, so he has a total of 10 objects (6 balloons + 4 balls). Therefore, the total number of objects in the park is 12 + 10 = 22 objects. So, yes, both Alan and Jake have many balls in the park.
Response:  If Alan had 5 balloons with him to the park and Jake had 6 balloons, then together they have 11 balloons (5 + 6). So, the correct answer is 11.
Response:  If Allan has three balloons and Jake has six balloons, then we can say that Jake has x more balloons than Allan. So, we can write an equation as follows: 3 = x + 6 (where x is the number of additional balloons Jake has). Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do that?
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and two hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends more time studying English than Chinese. So, we can say that he studies English for 6/14 = 0.429 (or approximately 43%) of his total study time, while he studies Chinese for 2/14 = 0.143 (or approximately 14%) of his total study time.
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day studying languages. So, he studies more hours of Chinese than English.
Response:  If Ryan spent 3 hours per day learning English and one hour per day learning Chinese, then he spent a total of 3 + 1 = 4 hours per day learning languages.  Therefore, if he spent 4 hours per day learning languages, he spent x hours per day learning Chinese.  Since we know that x is equal to 4, we can write the equation as follows:  x = 4.
Response:  If Ryan spent 7 hours per day learning English and one hour per day learning Chinese, then he spent a total of 8 hours per day (7 + 1) learning languages.  If he spent two more hours per day learning English than Chinese, that means he spent 6 hours per day (8 - 2) learning Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends five hours per day learning Chinese and four hours per day learning English, then he spends a total of 9 hours per day on language learning (5 + 4 = 9).  Now, if he spent two more hours per day learning English than Chinese, that means he spends 11 hours per day on English (9 + 2 = 11). So, the correct answer is 11 hours.
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 6 + 7 = 13 hours per day on language learning.  If he learns for five days, then he spends a total of 13 x 5 = 65 hours on language learning.
Response:  If he spends six hours per day learning English and five hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day (24 hours), he spends a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours learning these two languages.  Now, if he learns for two days instead of one day, he will spend twice as many hours learning - that is, 2 x 11 = 22 hours. So, if he learns for two days, he will have spent 22 hours learning English and Chinese combined.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day he learns:
English: 5 x 24 = 120 hours/day
Chinese: 4 x 24 = 96 hours/day
In total, Ryan learns:
120 + 96 = 216 hours/day
If he learns Chinese for 6 days, he will learn:
216 x 6 = 1304 hours of Chinese
Therefore, if Ryan learns Chinese for 6 days, he will have learned approximately 1304 hours of the language."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 6 hours learning Chinese every day. Therefore, in one day he learns 4 + 6 = 10 hours of these languages. Since he studies for 86 days, he learns 10 hours/day x 86 days = 860 hours of English and 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours of Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spent six hours per day learning English, seven hours per day learning Chinese, and three hours per day learning Spanish, then he spent a total of 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day studying languages.  Therefore, many hours did he spend learning English, Chinese, and Spanish? The answer is 16 hours.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ryan spent six hours per day studying English, three hours per day studying Chinese, and 58 hours per day studying Spanish.  To find out how many more hours he studied English than Chinese, we can subtract the number of hours he spent studying Chinese from the total number of hours he spent studying both languages:

6 hours/day - 3 hours/day = 3 hours/day

So, Ryan studied English for 3 times as many hours as he studied Chinese."
Response:  If Ryan spent 7 hours per day learning English, 2 hours per day learning Chinese, and 4 hours per day learning Spanish, then he spent a total of 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 hours per day studying languages. Therefore, it takes more time to learn English than it does to learn Spanish.
"Response: 
Ryan spent 5 hours per day learning English, 4 hours per day learning Chinese, and 3 hours per day learning Spanish. So in total he studied these languages for 12 hours per day (5 + 4 + 3 = 12).  Therefore, he studied more hours of Chinese than Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spent 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spent total of 21 hours (3 x 7) learning English in one week.  Now, if he reduced his time for learning English to 2 hours per day, he will spend total of 14 hours (2 x 7) learning English in one week.  Therefore, he will have more time to learn Chinese, which is 9 hours (3 - 14).
"Response:  Ryan has been studying English and Chinese for seven days. Each day, he spends four hours learning English and five hours learning Chinese. How many total hours does he spend on learning both languages combined?  To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends on each language per day by the number of days he has studied that language. For English, it is 4 x 7 = 28 hours; for Chinese, it is 5 x 7 = 35 hours. Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 63 hours (28 + 35) learning both English and Chinese."
"Response:  If Tiffany collected $10 in coins and said, ""I will come to an agreement with you soon,"" then the next day he found 7 pennies in his basement. How many more pennies did he find than he collected? Therefore, the answer is 3 (7 - 10)."
Response:  On Monday morning, Tiffany found 10 bags of chocolates. The next day (Tuesday), he found 12 more bags of chocolates. So in total, Tiffany found 22 bags of chocolates (10 + 12). Therefore, the correct answer is 22.
"Response:  If Tiffany had collected eggs in a heap and said, ""Well, I will soon make an agreement with you,"" then the next day he found four more pigs with bellies full of corn. If he had six colander boxes, how many colanders would he have found if he had danned (fleire) p√∏lser (pigs)?  Therefore, the answer is 6."
Response:  If Tiffany has collected $100 in coins and found 4 more hot dogs with buns afterward, then he now has a total of $100 + $4 = $104. Since there are 8 pennies in each dollar, Tiffany now has $\$104 / 8 = 13$ dollars worth of pennies. Therefore, the answer is $13$.
"Response:  If Tiffany gathered eggs in a heap and said, ""Well, I will soon make an agreement with you,"" then he found 3 baskets of potatoes the day after and 7 baskets of potatoes the day after that. How many baskets did Tiffany have?  We know that Tiffany found 10 baskets of potatoes in total (3 + 7 = 10). So, the answer is 10."
"Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected $10 worth of coins in his piggy bank. Then he said, ""I will soon make an agreement with you."" After that, he found $4 worth of coins in his piggy bank every day for the next three days. How many times did Tiffany find money after Monday?  Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response:  If Tiffany had collected 10 bags of potatoes and said, ""Well, I'll soon make an agreement with you,"" then the next day she found 7 baskets of rabbits and 44 bottles of wine. How many pigs did Tiffany have so together?  Solution: To find out how many pigs Tiffany had, we need to add up the number of baskets of rabbits (7) and the number of bottles of wine (44). So, Tiffany had 7 + 44 = 51 pigs in total."
Response:  We know that there are 17 red apples and 16 green apples in the basket. If more red apples are in the bag than green apples, then we can say that the ratio of red apples to green apples is greater than 1. So, the answer is yes, there are more red apples in the bag than green apples.
Response:  We have 12 green apples and 5 red apples in the basket. If many green apples are in the bag, it means that there are more than 12 green apples in total. So, the answer is yes, there are more than 12 green apples in the bag.
"Response:  If there are 10 rude fer skners and some green ones in the basket, and if there are 15 pears in the basket, then we can calculate how many green pears there are as follows:

Green pears = Total number of pears - Number of rude fer skners
= 15 - 10
= 5

So, there are 5 green pears in the basket."
Response:  If there are ten green berries in the basket and five raw berries in the basket, how many green berries are there then?  We know that the total number of berries is 15 (10 + 5). So, if there are 15 berries in the basket, and 10 of them are green, then the number of green berries is 10.
Response:  We have 7 raw fermenters (ferskner) and 15 green fermenters (ferskner). So far, we have a total of 22 fermenters in the barrel. Now, there are 8 more fermenters that are green. Therefore, the total number of fermenters in the barrel is now 22 + 8 = 30 fermenters.
Response:  We know that there are seven raw potatoes, thirty-five green peppers, and eight yellow peppers in the bag. If many green peppers are in the bag, it means that some of them must be yellow or red as well. So, we can conclude that there are at least seventy-one peppers (seven raw + thirty-five green + eight yellow) in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 6 yellow apples and 14 green apples in the basket. If many more green apples than yellow apples are in the bag, then we can say that the number of green apples is greater than the number of yellow apples. So, the answer to the question is yes.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red apples in the basket and 11 yellow apples. So, the total number of apples is 19 + 11 = 30. Now we need to compare how many more red apples than green apples there are. The number of green apples is 12. Therefore, there are 30 - 12 = 18 more red apples than green apples.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red and 9 green ferrets in the basket. If many red and green ferrets are in the basket, it means that some of them must be together. So, we can say that at least one red ferret is with one or more green ferrets. Similarly, at least one green ferret is with one or more red ferrets. Therefore, the number of pairs of red and green ferrets is at least 2 x (6/3) = 4. Since each pair has two ferrets, the total number of ferrets in pairs is 4 x 2 = 8. Thus, there are 8 ferrets in pairs in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red persimmons in the basket and 14 yellow persimmons. So, altogether we have 32 persimmons in the basket. Now, let's assume that many of them are fresh (green). So, the total number of green persimmons is 17. Therefore, the answer to your question is: Fresh persimmons = 17.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red persimmons in the basket, and each of them is fresh (i.e., not rotten). Therefore, the total number of fresh red persimmons is 5.  Next, we know that there are 14 yellow persimmons in the basket, and all of them are fresh. So, the total number of fresh yellow persimmons is also 14. Finally, we know that there are 6 green persimmons in the basket, but none of them are fresh (they are rotten). Therefore, the total number of rotten green persimmons is 6.  Now let's calculate the total number of fresh fruit in the basket:  Fresh red persimmons = 5; Fresh yellow persimmons = 14; Total number of fresh fruit = 5 + 14 = 19."
"Response:  We have 65 baskets of fresh cucumbers and each basket has 7 red cucumbers and 3 green cucumbers. How many baskets are there in total?

Answer: There are 65 x 7 = 455 red cucumbers and 65 x 3 = 195 green cucumbers. Therefore, there are 455 + 195 = 650 baskets in total."
Response:  We have 11 baskets with fresh quarts. Each basket has 10 red peppers and 18 green peppers. How many fresh ones are there in total? So, we can say that there are 10 + 18 = 28 fresh peppers in all the baskets together.
"Response:  We know that there are six baskets with fresh cucumbers and that each basket has 1/4 of a cucumber. Therefore, we can calculate how many cucumbers are in total as follows:

Number of cucumbers = Number of baskets x Amount of cucumbers per basket
= 6 x 16
= 96

So, there are 96 cucumbers in total."
Response:  We have 10 red apples and 2 green apples in total. If many green fresh apples are added to the basket, then the number of green apples in the basket will increase. So, the correct answer is 3 (the number of green apples that can be added).
"Response:  If there are 4 red apples and 3 green apples in one quarter of a room with a total of 7 apple boxes, then we can calculate how many apples you have in each box as follows:

Number of red apples = 4/4 = 1
Number of green apples = 3/4 = 0.75 (rounded to nearest whole number)
Total number of apples = 1 + 0.75 = 1.75
So, if there are 7 apple boxes in the room, then you have approximately 1.75 apples in each box."
Response:  We know that there are 4 red apples and some green apples in one of the two baskets. If there are 12 fresh apples in total in both baskets, then we can calculate the number of green apples in the other basket as follows: Number of green apples = Total number of fresh apples - Number of red apples  Number of green apples = 12 x 2 = 24 So, there are 24 green apples in the other basket.
Response:  We know that there are 13 red apples and some green ones in the basket. If we assume that all the green apples are equally distributed among themselves, then the number of green apples is equal to the total number of apples minus the number of red apples. So, if there are 13 red apples, then the number of green apples must be 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green apples in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red ferrets and 4 green ferrets in total. If we assume that many of them have children (ferrets), then we can calculate how many offspring they might have based on their numbers. For example, if each red ferret has an average of 6 pups per litter, then we would have:  Number of red ferrets x Average number of pups per litter = Total number of offspring for red ferrets In this case, we have 19 red ferrets with an average of 6 pups per litter, so we get: 19 x 6 = 114 offspring for red ferrets Similarly, if each green ferret has an average of 3 pups per litter, then we would have:  Number of green ferrets x Average number of pups per litter = Total number of offspring for green ferrets In this case, we have 4 green ferrets with an average of 3 pups per litter, so we get: 4 x 3 = 12 offspring for green ferrets Therefore, the total number of offspring for all ferrets is: 114 + 12 = 126 offspring.
Response:  If one box has 4 red apples and 6 green apples, then there are in total 4 + 6 = 10 apples in that box.  Therefore, if we have 10 boxes, each containing 10 apples, then the total number of apples is 10 x 10 = 100 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 green apples in the basket and 60 yellow apples in the basket as well. So, the total number of apples in the basket is 6 + 60 = 66 apples. Now, we need to find out how many red apples are in the basket. According to the problem statement, ""2 raue ferskjer"" (two red apples) are in the basket. Therefore, the total number of apples in the basket is 66 + 2 = 68 apples."
Response:  Jerry started with 4 action figures on one shelf in his room. Later, he added more figures to the same shelf. If there are now 8 action figures on the shelf, then how many has Jerry added later?  Solution:  We know that Jerry started with 4 action figures, and now there are 8 on the shelf. So, Jerry has added 4 additional action figures to the shelf.
Response:  Jerry started with some small figures on a shelf in his room. Later, he got 7 more. If there are 10 action figures on the shelf now, how many did Jerry have initially?  Therefore, the answer is 3 (initially).
Response:  Jerry had 4 origins and 22 books in his room. Later, he got 6 more figures. So, how many things did Jerry have in total?  We can count them one by one: 4 origins + 6 figures = 10 things. Therefore, Jerry had 10 things in total.
Response:  Jerry initially had 5 prosthetic limbs and 9 books on the shelf in his room. Later, he received 7 more prosthetic limbs. So, the total number of prosthetic limbs Jerry has now is: 5 + 7 = 12.
Response:  Jerry initially had 2 t-shirts and 10 books on his shelf. Later, he received 4 more books. To find out how many more books Jerry has than action figures, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the total number of items Jerry had at first: 2 (t-shirts) + 10 (books) = 12 Initially, Jerry had 12 items in total. After receiving 4 more books, Jerry now has: 12 + 4 = 16 So, Jerry has 4 more books than action figures he had initially.
Response:  Jerry had 8 t-shirts and 9 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 10 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry had 8 + 10 = 18 items on his shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially had 7 figurines and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books. So, in total, there are now 7 + 4 = 11 items on the shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 11.
Response:  Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf initially. Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf. So, in total, Jerry had 14 items (5 action figures + 2 books + 9 new books) on his shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is 14.
Response:  Jerry started with 8 chairs in his room and later got 4 more. So he now has 12 chairs (8 + 4). He also removed 5 old figures earlier. Therefore, there are still 7 chairs left in the room (12 - 5).
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later, he got 4 more and took away some of the old ones. So, how many action figures are there now on the shelf?  We know that Jerry took away some of the old ones, but we don't know exactly how many. Therefore, our answer is ""some""."
Response:  Jerry started with 7 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later, he added more and took away some of the old ones. If there are now 8 action figures on the shelf, how many has he added since then?  Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  Jerry initially had some small figures on a shelf in his room. Later, he got 2 more and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are now 10 action figures on the shelf, then how many did Jerry have originally?  Solution:  We know that Jerry had some initial number of figures (let's call it x). When he got 2 new figures, the total number became x + 2. Then, when he removed 7 old figures, the total number decreased to x - 7. Finally, if there are now 10 action figures on the shelf, we can write an equation based on this information: x + 2 = 10... (1) Subtracting x from both sides gives us: 2 = 8... (2) Solving for x, we get: x = 6 So, Jerry had 6 action figures on the shelf initially.
Response:  Jerry initially had 9 apples on one shelf in his room. Later, he got 7 more apples. So, now he has 9 + 7 = 16 apples in total. If he had 10 books on the shelf before, and there were as many figures on the shelf as there are apples, then there would be 10 x 16 = 160 figures on the shelf afterward.
"Response:  Jerry initially had 3 books and 4 t-shirts on his shelf. Later, he received 2 more items. So, in total, Jerry has 5 things now (books + t-shirts). Therefore, the number of ""fleure"" (a made-up word) prototypes is 5."
Response:  Jerry initially had 7 books and 3 toy cars on his shelf. Later, he received 2 more books. So, in total, Jerry now has 9 items (7 books + 2 new books) on his shelf. Therefore, the number of books Jerry had is greater than the number of action figures he had.
Response:  If there are six birds following the first bird to the fence and some of them come to the fence, then we can say that at least three birds came to the fence. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  If there were initially ""nokre"" (a few) birds sitting on the fence and four of them flew away, then the number of birds left on the fence is:

N = initial number - number that flew away
= nokre - 4
=?

So, if 5 birds had been on the fence before, then the number of birds left after 4 flew away is:

N = 5 - 4
= 1

Therefore, there was one bird left on the fence after 4 birds flew away."
Response:  We have 46 large birds (storks) and 46 small birds (fugles). If six of them were knocked down, then we can say that... (calculate the percentage of birds that were knocked down)...so the answer is 6/92 = 0.064 or approximately 6%.
Response:  We have 5 birds (fugler) sitting on a wire (gjerde). Then we have 2 storks (storkar) also sitting on the same wire. So in total, we have 7 birds (fugler + storkar) sitting on the wire.
Response:  We have three birds and four storks sitting on a wire. Two of the birds come from another city. They cannot fly. Therefore, we can conclude that there are two birds left on the wire.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 6 storks sitting on the wire initially. Then, 4 more birds come to join them. So, we now have 7 birds (including the original 3) and 6 storks. Now, let's count how many more storks there are than birds: 6 storks - 3 birds = 3 more storks than birds. Therefore, the answer is 3 more storks than birds.
Response:  We have 2 firefugles (fugl = bird) and 6 storks sitting on the roof. Then, 2 new storks come to join them. So, in total we have 8 storks sitting on the roof.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on fences. If six of them were removed, then we are left with 3 + 4 = 7 birds and storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, many birds and storks can sit on a fence.
Response:  We have 3 seagulls and 3 cranes already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 new cranes come to join them. So, in total we have 5 cranes (3 existing + 2 new). Now, let's count the number of seagulls again. We still have 3 seagulls that were there initially. Therefore, the final answer is 5 cranes and 3 seagulls.
"Response:  If we have 6 birds sitting on a wire and they are all removed (or ""sleta""), then there will be no more birds left on the wire. So, the number of birds remaining after removal is 0.  Now, let's compare this to the original number of birds that were sitting on the wire, which was 6. Therefore, the ratio of birds remaining to birds originally present is 0/6 = 0.25 or 1/4."
Response:  We have four seagulls and eight cranes following them. They were born in one nest. How many birds can sit on a wire?  Solution:  The total number of birds that can sit on the wire is 4 + 8 = 12. So, the answer is 12.
Response:  We have five birds (fugler) sitting on the fence. Then four storks (storkar) came along with four more birds (fugler). So in total we have... (counting on your fingers)...15 birds (fugler)!
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, 2 more birds come to join them, so now there are 5 birds (3 initial + 2 new). Next, 6 storks come and join them, so now there are 11 birds (5 initial + 6 new) sitting on the fence. Therefore, the correct answer is 11.
Response:  We have four birds sitting on the fence initially. Then three more birds come to join them. So, in total we have seven birds (4 + 3 = 7).
Response:  We have three birds sitting on the fence initially and four more birds come to join them later. So, in total we have 3 + 4 = 7 birds sitting on the fence. Now, let's count how many storks are sitting on the fence. According to the problem statement, there are two storks sitting on the fence initially. Since no new storks came to join them, the number of storks remaining on the fence remains unchanged at two. Therefore, the final answer is 7 bird(s) - 2 stork(s) = 5 bird(s).
Response:  We have 3 birds sitting on the fence initially. Then, we add 6 more birds and they come to join the existing ones. So, in total, we have 9 birds (3 + 6 = 9). Now, let's check if there are more than 9 storks. According to the question, storks can't fly, so they will not be able to move from one place to another. Therefore, all the 9 birds that are already on the fence will remain there, and no new storks will come to join them. Hence, the final number of birds sitting on the fence is 9.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out if the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter, we need to divide the number of pages in the first chapter by the number of pages in the second chapter. We get: Number of pages in first chapter = 48 / Number of pages in second chapter = 48 / 11 = 4.36 (round up to 4 chapters) So, yes, the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  We know that the first chapter is 37 pages long, and we want to find out how many pages are in the second chapter. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages (which we assume is equal to the sum of the two chapters) by the number of pages in the first chapter. So if the total number of pages is x, then the number of pages in the first chapter is x / 37 = y, where y is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Now we know that the second chapter has y + 80 pages, so its length is y + 80. Therefore, the difference between the lengths of the two chapters is y + 80 - 37 = 43.
Response:  We know that the first chapter is 60 pages long and we want to find out how many pages are in the second chapter. Since there are 93 pages in total, we can write an equation: Number of pages in Chapter 2 = Total number of pages - Number of pages in Chapter 1 So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of pages in Chapter 2 = 93 - 60 = 33 pages Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book, and the second chapter is 36 pages long. To find out how many pages the first chapter has, we can use the following equation: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in Chapter 2 So, if there are 67 pages in the entire book, and 36 pages in the second chapter, then the number of pages in the first chapter would be: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = 67 - 36 = 31 pages Therefore, the first chapter has 31 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 66 pages, the second chapter has 35 pages, and the third chapter has 24 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the number of pages in the first and second chapters is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 68 pages more than the second chapter.
Response:  We know that the first chapter is 35 pages long, the second chapter is 18 pages long, and the third chapter is 3 pages long. To find out how many pages the other chapters have, we can subtract their lengths from the total number of pages in the book. So, if the book has 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages in total, then each chapter except for the third one has approximately 66 / 2 = 33 pages. Therefore, all but the third chapter have 33 pages.
Response:  First, we know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 50 = 150 pages.  Now, let's analyze each chapter separately:  Chapter 1 has 53 pages, so it takes up 53/150 = 0.356 (or approximately 35.6%) of the total number of pages in the book.  Similarly, Chapter 2 has 75 pages, so it takes up 75/150 = 0.50 (or approximately 50%) of the total number of pages in the book.  And finally, Chapter 3 has 21 pages, so it takes up 21/150 = 0.14 (or approximately 14%) of the total number of pages in the book. Therefore, the first chapter has more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 4 quarters (or parts). So, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of quarters per chapter x Page length Total number of pages = 31 x 4 x 61 = 5760 pages Therefore, the book contains approximately 5760 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 10 pages, and there are two chapters in total. Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter is:  Number of pages in first chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, we can plug in the values given in the question: Number of pages in first chapter = (23 + 23) / 2 = 46 pages Yes, the first chapter contains many pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 81 pages, and the second chapter has 68 pages. Therefore, there are 81 - 68 = 13 pages less in the second chapter than in the first chapter. So, yes, many pages have been removed from the second chapter compared to the first chapter.
Response:  We know that 62 people went out in a boat this morning and 39 of them were smoking in the afternoon. So, we can conclude that more than half (62/100) of the people who went out in the boat this morning were smoking in the afternoon. Therefore, the answer is yes, many more passengers went on tour in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  If 52 people went fishing in the morning and 61 were on shore that afternoon, then we can conclude that more people went fishing in the afternoon than in the morning (61 - 52 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  If 15 people went out to fish in the morning, and some of them returned in the afternoon, then we can assume that at least some of those who went out in the morning also went out again in the afternoon. So, if there were initially 32 people who went out to sea, then after some of them returned in the afternoon, there would be fewer than 32 people left on the water. However, since it is not specified how many of the original 32 people went back out to sea, we cannot determine exactly how many are still out there. Therefore, our answer is ""some"" or ""fewer than 32""."
"Response:  If 30 people went out in the morning and 40 people went out in the afternoon, and there were 60 people who went out altogether that day, then we can calculate the proportion of people who went out in the morning as follows:

Proportion of people who went out in the morning = Number of people who went out in the morning / Total number of people who went out that day
= 30 / 60
= 0.5 or 50%
So, many of the people who went out in the morning also went out again in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that there are 36 people going out in the morning and 49 people going out in the evening. So, if many of these people go to the party, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36 and 49. The LCM is 1380. Therefore, many of the people who went out will be at the party.
Response:  In the morning (08:00-12:00), 44 people went out for a walk.  In the afternoon (13:00-17:00), 39 people went out for a walk.  And in the evening (18:00-22:00), 31 people went out for a walk. So, we can see that more people went out for a walk in the morning than in either of the other two time periods. Therefore, the answer is: More people went out for a walk in the morning than in any other time period.
Response:  We know that 53 people went out in the morning and 49 people came back in the evening from New York to Norway. So, we can say that there are more people who left than returned. Therefore, the number of people who went from New York to Norway is greater than the number of people who returned.  In other words, A > B.
Response:  We know that 33 people leave in the morning, and 34 people leave in the afternoon. So, the total number of people leaving is: 33 + 34 = 67. And finally, 10 people arrive in the evening. Therefore, the final number of people present in the city is: 67 + 10 = 77.
Response:  If 13 people went out to have fun and 59 people went out to go to parties, then there are a total of 72 people who went out (13 + 59 = 72).  Of these, 21 people went out in the afternoon (21/72 = 0.30). So, many of those who went out had fun at this party.
Response:  We know that 29 people went out to play and 66 people went out for a walk.  Since 26 of them were smoking in the afternoon, we can conclude that more people went for a walk in the morning than in the afternoon. So, the answer is: More people went for a walk in the morning (66) than in the afternoon (26).
Response:  We know that 41 people went out to play and 4 people went out for a tour.  Since 26 of them were smoking in the afternoon, we can conclude that many of those who went out to play are from New York and came to visit the city. So, the answer is:  Yes, many of the people who went out to play are from New York and came to visit the city.
Response:  We know that 46 people went on a day trip and 43 of them were smoking in the morning and some were smoking in the afternoon. Can many of these people be from New York who have come here?  To determine this, we need to divide the number of people who were smoking at different times by the total number of people who went on the day trip.  So, if 43 out of 46 people were smoking in the morning, then the proportion of people who were smoking in the morning is 43/46 = 0.95 (or 95%). Similarly, if some were smoking in the afternoon, let's say 10 out of 46 people, then the proportion of people who were smoking in the afternoon is 10/46 = 0.22 (or 22%). Therefore, the percentage of people from New York who came for the day trip can be calculated as follows: (0.95 x 0.22) / 1 = 0.208 (or 20.8%) So, approximately 20.8% of the people on the day trip are likely to be from New York.
"Response:  If Rachel hacks an apple from tree number three of hers (hers means that she owns the tree), then we have to count how many apples are left on the tree after she has taken one. So, there are six apples remaining on the tree. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The phrase ""Kor mange eple har eg att p√• treet?"" translates to ""How many apples do I have on my tree?"" In this case, since Rachel has six apples left on her tree, the answer is six."
Response:  If Pallen took 4 apples from the tree and put 2 of them back, then he left with 2 apples. Now, if Rachel picked some more apples, she would have taken away some of the remaining apples that Pallen left behind. So, the number of apples Rachel took is equal to the number of apples Pallen left behind minus the number of apples he originally took. In this case, Pallen left behind 2 apples, so Rachel took 0 apples (since she didn't take any). Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  If Rachel has 7 apple trees and she picks 3 apples from each tree (total of 21 apples). Then, out of those 21 apples, 5 are mature and the remaining 16 are immature. So, if we subtract the number of immature apples (16) from the total number of apples picked (21), we get 5 mature apples left. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  If Rachel has hacked 3 apples from the tree in her yard and she now has 7 apples left on her own tree, then we can assume that 6 of those 7 apples are mature (mogne) and 1 is immature (umogene). So, if one apple remains on each of the two trees, how many apples do they need to have altogether?  Therefore, the answer is 2 + 2 = 4 apples.
Response:  If Rachel has hacked 3 mature apples from the tree in front of her house and there are 2 more mature apples and 4 unripe apples left on the tree, then we can calculate how many mature apples are left on the tree as follows:  Mature apples = Total mature apples - Apples taken by Rachel = 5 (mature apples left on the tree) So, yes, many apples will be needed at the front if only 5 mature apples are left on the tree after Rachel took some.
Response:  Rachel picked 3 modern apples from the tree. The tree has 3 full apples and half an apple. Does one need to put many apples in the freezer?  Solution: Based on the information provided, we can conclude that one does not need to put any apples in the freezer because there are already 3 full apples and half an apple on the tree. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 7 apples on her tree. Later, she got 2 new apples. Now, she has 6 apples on her tree. Does many apples need one in front?  Yes, many apples need one in front. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked 4 apples from her three trees. After that, 3 of those apples grew back on their respective trees. So, how many apples did Rachel have left after picking and growing back some? Well, if she started with 4 apples and lost 1 (the one she picked), then she has 3 apples left. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Rachel has 52 apples and takes two from one of three baskets. Now she has seven apples left in three baskets. Does many apples need one basket in front?  Yes, many apples need one basket in front. So, the answer is 7.
Response:  If Rachel had three apple trees and picked eight apples from one of them, then she has two remaining trees with nine apples each. So, in total, Rachel has 18 apples (2 x 9 = 18). Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 4 apple trees and picked 7 apples from 3 of them. So she has 3 x 7 = 21 apples left in her trees. Now we are asked how many apples Rachel took together. To find this out, we need to add the number of apples she picked (21) to the number of apples she had left in her trees (21). Therefore, the correct answer is: 21 + 21 = 42 apples.
Response:  We know that Ed has 19 golf balls and he uses them to jump on a board.  Now, we are asked how many times Doug fell from the tree.  Since Doug tapped the ball game on the garden, it means he hit one of the balls with his bat. So, let's assume that each time he hits a ball, he falls from the tree once. Therefore, the number of times Doug fell from the tree is equal to the number of balls he hit.  Since Ed has 19 golf balls, and he uses them all to jump on the board, it means that Doug fell from the tree 19 times.
Response:  We know that Ed has 3 more gongs than Meg (Ed has 9 gongs and Meg has 6).  And we also know that Doug lost 11 teeth playing lagomspelen. So if Ed had 45 marbles, how many would he have then? Well, let's count them together:  Ed has 9 gongs + 3 more than Meg = 12 gongs.  If each gong represents 4 marbles, then Ed has 48 marbles in total!
Response:  We know that Ed has more than 10 balls (gongers) because he has 22 in total and only 7 are left for his opponent to hit. So, let's assume that Ed has x number of balls initially. Since Doug hits 7 of them, we can say that after Doug's turn, Ed has x - 7 balls remaining. Now, since Meg has 3 balls, she will have at most x - 7 + 3 = x + 4 balls. Therefore, Ed must have had at least 25 balls initially (x > 25).
Response:  We know that Ed has 5 children and Meg has none.  If Doug taps 3 of Busane's apples on time, then he must have taken them from Busane. So, Busane has 27 - 3 = 24 apples left. Since Ed has 5 children, each child will get an equal share of 24 apples, which means that Doug will have 24 / 5 = 4.8 apples. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Ed has $24 more than Doug and Doug spent $27 of his money on something. So, Ed now has $24 + $27 = $51 more than Doug. Therefore, Ed has 9 - 3 = 6 more dollars than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has 29 friends and he won 17 of them from Doug. So, we can say that Ed won $17 \times 29 = 463$ dollars from Doug. Therefore, Ed had more money than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has $19 more than Doug. So, if Doug has $8, then Ed has $27 ($19 + $8). Now, we are told that Ed has eight times as many dollars as Doug. Therefore, Ed has $27 x 8 = $204. So, Ed has $204 more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has 30 balls and he won 21 of them back from his friends. So, he lost 9 balls (30 - 21 = 9). Now we are asked how many balls Ed had in total before he started playing with his friends. From the previous question, we know that Ed had 91 balls initially. Therefore, the correct answer is: Ed had 91 balls initially.
Response:  We know that Ed has 12 balls and he loses 20 of them. So, Ed now has 12 - 20 = 4 balls left. If Ed had 17 marbles in total (including the ones he lost), then Doug must have had x + 4 = 17 marbles initially, where x is the number of marbles Ed had. Since Ed had 12 balls initially, we can write x = 12. Therefore, Doug had 12 + 4 = 16 marbles initially.
"Response:  If 408 students want to have French fries and 42 of them want bacon, then we can say that:

Number of students who want French fries = 408
Number of students who want bacon = 42
Total number of students = 408 + 42 = 450

So, among the total number of students (450), 396 (91%) want French fries while 54 (12%) want bacon."
"Response:  If 479 students want pommes frites and 489 students want bacon, then we can calculate the number of students who want both by subtracting the number of students who only want one from the total number of students. So, the number of students who want both is:

Total number of students = 479 + 489 - (479 + 489) / 2 = 1068

Therefore, out of the 1068 students, many will have bacon."
"Response:  If 310 students were asked if they wanted to find out what kind of food they would like to eat, and 185 of them said they want to have rice pudding while others suggested bacon, then we can conclude that:

* Out of 310 students, 185 (or 59%) want rice pudding as their preferred food option.
* The remaining 125 students (or 41%) did not express any preference or had other suggestions.

So, among the students who expressed an opinion, more than half (59%) prefer rice pudding, while around 4 in 10 (41%) do not have a clear preference or suggest other options."
"Response:  If 288 students were asked if they could find out what kind of food they would like to have, and 264 of them wanted bacon, then we can conclude that about 90% (264/288) of the students want bacon.  Therefore, many of the students who answered ""no"" might not have had any specific preference for food."
Response:  If 457 students want to have mashed potatoes (maisp√∏e), then there are 457 - 63 = 404 students who do not want mashed potatoes. Among these 404 students, some will choose bacon, so we can write an equation: Bacon chosen = Total number of students - Number of students who want mashed potatoes. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Bacon chosen = 404 - 63 = 341. Therefore, 341 students out of 457 will choose bacon.
Response:  If 182 students want to have mashed potatoes (maisp√∏e), then there are 104 students who do not want it (since 182 - 104 = 78).  If 78 students do not want mashed potatoes, then they must want something else.  Therefore, the number of students who will have bacon is 78.
Response:  If 324 students suggested having potato puree, and 374 students suggested having bacon, then there are 698 total suggestions (324 + 374). Of these, 128 students suggested having tomatoes, so there are 560 remaining students who did not suggest any of those three options (698 - 324 - 374 = 560). Therefore, many of the students were suggesting new food items.
Response:  If 257 students suggested having potato puree, and 120 of them also suggested having bacon, then there are 377 (257 + 120) suggestions in total.  If 97 students suggested having tomatoes, then there are 474 (377 + 97) suggestions in total. So, among those who suggested having potato puree, 68% (474/750 \* 100%) would have chosen it.
"Response:  We know that 144 students want fries, and 467 students want bacon. So, if we subtract the number of students who want bacon from the total number of students (511), we get:

511 - 467 = 44

So, there are 44 students who do not want either fries or bacon. Now, let's assume that among these 44 students, 79 want tomatoes. This means that out of the remaining 44 students, 35 want neither fries nor bacon nor tomatoes. Therefore, the final number of students who want at least one of these three options is:

44 + 35 = 79

Therefore, 79 students would have at least one of the following options: fries, bacon, or tomatoes."
Response:  If 228 students suggested having potato puree and 337 suggested having bacon, then there are 565 students in total (228 + 337 = 565). So, if 23 students suggested having tomatoes, then the number of students who would have chosen bacon is 542 (565 - 23 = 542).
Response:  If 450 students want pommes frites (PF), then there are 450 - 38 = 412 students who do not want pommes frites. Among these remaining students, some may choose other options, but let's assume that none of them want bacon (BA). Therefore, the number of students who will not participate in the survey is 412.
"Response:  If 218 students want potato puree with bacon and 351 students want bacon, then we can conclude that:

Number of students who want bacon = Total number of students - Number of students who want potato puree with bacon
= 351 - 218
= 133

Therefore, many of the students would have chosen bacon."
Response:  If 269 students want bacon and 330 want fries, then there are altogether 599 students (269 + 330). Now, if 76 students want tomatoes, we subtract that number from the total to get the number of students who want either bacon or fries: 599 - 76 = 523. Therefore, many of the students would have chosen fries.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many boys each girl has, we need to divide the number of boys by the total number of students (569 + 236 = 785). So, each girl has approximately 1.4 boys.
Response:  We have 34 girls and 841 boys in school. So, we can say that there are 875 students (34 + 841) in total. Therefore, the number of boys is 841.
"Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total at this school. Of those, 232 are girls and 153 are boys (halving the number of boys). So, we have:
Girls = 232
Boys = 153
Therefore, many births do you have at this school? Well, to find out how many births there were, we need to divide the number of children by the age range of each child. For example, if a child is 6 years old, then they must be born between ages 0-6. Similarly, if a child is 12 years old, then they must be born between ages 0-12. Therefore, we can calculate the average number of births per year as follows:
Average no. of births/year = Total no. of students / Age range of each student
= 485 / (6 - 0)
= 485 / 6
= 81 births/year
So, based on these calculations, there are approximately 81 births per year at this school!"
Response:  If there are 697 girls and half a million boys, then the number of boys is equal to half a million minus 697 = 431,500. So, there are 228 more girls than boys.
Response:  If there are 635 girls and half a million boys (which is equal to 252,500), then we can calculate the number of non-binary students as follows: Non-binary = Total number of students - Number of girls - Number of boys. Non-binary = 635 + 252,500 - 510 = 374. So, out of the total number of students, approximately 374 are non-binary.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and half a million boys in school, then the number of girls is greater than the number of boys. So, if we divide the number of girls by two, we get the number of boys: Number of girls = 868 / 2 = 434 boys. Therefore, there are 434 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 700 girls and half a million boys, then the number of boys is twice that of girls. So, if there are 142 more boys than girls, we can calculate it as follows: Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls Number of girls = Half a million (total number of students) - 700 (number of girls) = 350,000 (approximately) Therefore, there are approximately 350,000 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in total at the school. Then, we learn that 418 of the girls came to school. So, the number of girls who did not come to school is: 706 - 418 = 288. Now, we need to find out how many boys did not come to school as well. Since there are 222 boys, and 418 girls came to school, the number of boys who did not come to school is: 222 - (418 / 2) = 222 - 209 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 boys who did not come to school.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls and 811 boys in the school initially. Then, 44 more girls join the school. So, the total number of girls now is: 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, the percentage of girls in the school is: (946 / 1713) x 100% = 55.3%.
Response:  We have 632 girls and 410 boys in total at the school. Then, 465 more girls come to the school. So, we now have 632 + 465 = 1097 girls at the school. In terms of boys, we still have 410 boys. Therefore, the ratio of girls to boys is 1097 : 410 = 2.68.
Response:  We know that there are 732 girls and 761 boys in total at the school. Then, we learn that 682 girls and 8 boys came to school for the first time. So, the number of girls who have never been to school before is 50 (732 - 682). Therefore, the answer is 50.
Response:  We have 135 girls and 214 boys in total. If 496 girls and 910 boys wrote to us, then we can calculate the number of births as follows: Number of births = Total number of students x Percentage of students who wrote to us So, the number of births is: Number of births = 135 x 496 + 214 x 910 = 678 + 1844 = 2522 births Therefore, there are approximately 2522 births among the students at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in total at the school.  Therefore, the number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now we need to find out how many teachers are at the school. According to the question, there are 36 teachers. So, the ratio of students to teachers is 626 / 36 = 17.5.
Response:  We have 315 girls and 309 boys in school, which means there are 624 students in total (315 + 309 = 624). Now, we need to find out how many teachers are at the school. The question states that there are 772 teachers, so we can conclude that each teacher is responsible for approximately 1.2 students (772 / 624 = 1.2). Therefore, many of the diving are not with their parents.
Response:  If there are 402 girls in a school and 739 students total, then there must be more boys than girls since there are fewer girls than boys. So, if we assume that the number of boys is x, we can set up the equation: Girls = 402 Boys + 739 - x. Now, we need to solve for x, which means we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 402 from both sides of the equation: Boys = 739 - 402 + x. Now, we have an equation where x represents the number of boys: x = 337. Therefore, if there are 739 students in the school, there must be 337 boys.
Response:  If there are 458 girls and 692 students in total at the school, then the number of boys is (692 - 458) = 234. Therefore, there are more girls than boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. If we multiply these numbers together, we get: 362 x 257 = 91,840. So, many girls have one boyfriend.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16 on something. So he has $2 left ($18 - $16 = $2). Therefore, Edward has $2.
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some of it on something (we don't know what). Now he has $3 left in his hands. So, Edward did not spend money on buying a car.  Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $9 per day to buy a new car. Then he said that you had $8 left after buying the car. So, Edward has $17 in cash now. Therefore, Edward had $25 ($9 - $8) in cash before he spent any money.
Response:  Edward gave $16 to buy 92 books that cost him the same amount of money. So he spent $0.18 per book ($16 / 92). Now, he has $6 left in his pocket. To find out how much money Edward had before he spent it, we can divide the initial amount by the number of books he bought: $16 / 92 = $0.175 (or approximately $0.18). Therefore, Edward had $0.18 + $0.175 = $0.355 in cash before he spent any money.
Response:  Edward gave $6 for two books that cost him the same amount of money. They were once two books, but now there is one left. He spent $6 on buying one book. Now he has $12 in his hand. So, how much will it cost him for the remaining book?  Solution: The cost of the remaining book = Total amount of money with him - Amount he spent on buying one book = $12 - $6 = $6. Therefore, the remaining book will cost him $6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens. So he has $6 + $16 = $22 left after buying those items. Now, we are told that he has $19 in his pocket. Therefore, the amount of money Edward had before spending any money is $19 - $22 = -$3.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens. So he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying those things. Therefore, Edward used $7 to buy books and pens.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount of money he had before buying them: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, Edward spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward spent $17 on landing at an ant hill. Then he received $10 from a friend of his own. So now he has $7 in cash. Therefore, Edward had $7 in cash before he used the money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 tasks in an hour and David did 58 more tasks than Zachary. So, if we want to find out how many tasks Zachary did, we can subtract the number of tasks David did from the total number of tasks Zachary did.  Tasks done by Zachary = Total tasks - Number of tasks done by David  In this case, the total number of tasks Zachary did was 44, and the number of tasks David did was 58. Therefore, the number of tasks Zachary did is:  Tasks done by Zachary = 44 - 58 = -14  So, Zachary did -14 tasks in an hour.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 exercises in an hour and David did 44 exercises in an hour. To find out who did more exercises, we need to divide the number of exercises each person did by the time they spent doing them. So, let's do that!  Zachary did 51 exercises in 1 hour = 51/1 = 51 exercises per hour David did 44 exercises in 1 hour = 44/1 = 44 exercises per hour Now, we can see that Zachary did more exercises than David because Zachary did 51 exercises per hour while David did only 44 exercises per hour. Therefore, the answer is Zachary had more many exercises than David.
Response:  We know that David made 44 tasks in an hour today and he did 9 more uploads than Zachary. So, if Zachary made x uploads, then David made 44 - 9 = 35 uploads. Therefore, Zachary has made 35 uploads.
Response:  We know that David made 51 sets of exercises at the gym today and Zachary did fewer than him. So, we can say that Zachary made x number of sets of exercises. Since David made more sets than Zachary, we can write an inequality: x < 51. Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can use the fact that David made 49 more sets than Zachary. This means that Zachary made 51 - 49 = 2 sets of exercises. Therefore, x = 2. So, Zachary made 2 sets of exercises at the gym today.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 59 pickups and 44 setups in an hour today. So, he made a total of 103 actions (59 + 44) in one hour. Now, we are told that David did 19 more or fewer pickups than Zachary. This means that if Zachary made x pickups, then David made x - 19 pickups. Therefore, David made 72 pickups (x - 19).
Response:  We know that Zachary made 44 upstrokes and 17 downstrokes in an hour today.  We also know that David made 29 more upstrokes than Zachary but fewer than him overall. So, if we divide the number of upstrokes David made (29) by the number of minutes he played (in an hour), we get his average upstroke per minute. Then, we can multiply this number by the total number of minutes he played to find out how many upstrokes he made altogether. Finally, we subtract the number of downstrokes David made from the total number of upstrokes to find out how many more upstrokes he made than Zachary. Therefore, the answer is:  David made 29 + 13 = 42 upstrokes in total.
Response:  Firstly, Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 sit-ups at the gym today. Then, David did 17 up-and-down movements to Zachary's 53. Finally, David did 7 up-and-down movements to you (not mentioned in the question). So, the total number of push-ups and sit-ups Zachary had done is: 53 + 17 = 70.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 exercises in gymnastics and 3 sit-ups.  We also know that David did 58 push-ups but fewer than Zachary. So we can say that if Zachary did x push-ups, then David did x - 87 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did more push-ups than David.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 46 operations in an hour today.  David made 38 overcuts to Zachary, but fewer than he did last year. So, we can say that David made x overcuts this year, where x is less than 62. Now, we need to find out how many more operations Zachary performed than David. Let's write an equation based on the information given:
Zachary's operations = David's overcuts + Zachary's operations - David's overcuts (last year)
We are told that David made 38 overcuts to Zachary and 62 fewer than he did last year. So, we can substitute these values into the equation above:
Zachary's operations = 38 + Zachary's operations - 62
Now, we know that Zachary made 46 operations in an hour today, so we can plug this value into the equation:
Zachary's operations = 38 + 46 - 62
Simplifying the equation, we get:
Zachary's operations = 15
So, Zachary performed 15 more operations than David did."
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 19 tasks in an hour today. David made more than Zachary, so let's say he made x tasks in an hour. Since John made fewer than David, we can say that John made y tasks in an hour less than David. Now, we are given that David did more than Zachary, so we can write:
x + y = 19 (David did 19 tasks)
Since John did 13 tasks less than David, we can write:
y - 13 = x (John did x tasks)
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving them simultaneously gives us:
x = 40
y = 26
So, David made 40 tasks in an hour and John made 26 tasks in an hour less than David."
Response:  We know that Zachary made 51 moves in an hour today. David made 22 up and down movements more than Zachary. So, David made 73 moves (51 + 22). John made 4 fewer movements than David, so John made 69 movements (73 - 4). Therefore, John made 69 movements.
"Response:  We know that Zachary made 15 throws in an hour today.  David made more than 15 throws, so let's say he made 39 throws. Since John made fewer than 9 throws, we can conclude that Zachary threw more pom-poms than John. However, we don't have enough information to determine whether Zachary threw more than or equal to David. Therefore, the correct answer is ""We cannot tell."""
Response:  If David did 30 tasks in an hour and he did 37 more than Zachary, then... (1) David did 30 + 37 = 67 tasks in total. (2) Since David did 67 tasks in one hour, he did 67 / 60 = 1.12 tasks per minute. Therefore, David did 1.12 x 60 = 67.2 minutes of work in one hour.
Response:  If David made 56 flips over Zachary in one hour of gymnastics and if David did 38 of them over Zachary, then he would have performed 20 flips over Zachary. So, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  We know that David did 40 push-ups and sit-ups in total.  If he did 17 sit-ups per minute, then he did 17 x 4 = 68 sit-ups in total.  Now we need to find out how many crunches Zachary did.  The question states that Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 crunches. So if he did 62 crunches in one minute, then he did 62 / 40 = 1.55 crunches per second. Therefore, Zachary did 1.55 x 4 = 6.2 crunches more than David.
Response:  If David made 36 up and down movements to Zachary in one hour of his day, then Zachary did 58 - 36 = 22 more up and down movements than David.  Similarly, if Zachary made 33 strikes beyond the line, he did 33 - 36 = -3 fewer strikes beyond the line than David.
Response:  If David made 27 up and down movements to Zachary in an hour today, that means he performed each movement 27/60 = 0.45 times per minute.  Now, if Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 sit-ups, we can calculate how many total sit-ups he did as follows: Total sit-ups = (5 + 17) x 60 = 92 sit-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 92 sit-ups in one hour.
Response:  If Rachel has to do 5 math problems and 2 reading comprehension passages, then she will have to spend approximately 10 minutes per problem for math and 5 minutes per passage for reading. Therefore, in total, Rachel will need around 50 minutes (5 x 10) + 10 minutes (2 x 5) = 60 minutes to complete all her tasks.
Response:  If Rachel has to make 3 sets of math problems and 4 sets of reading comprehension passages, then she will have learned about 12 different topics in mathematics (3 x 4 = 12).
Response:  If Rachel needs to fill up 7 pages with illustrations and reading comprehension exercises, she will need to draw many illustrations.  Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If Rachel has to make 7 pages of homework from the math institute and she wants to have 4 more pages than the number of exercises she had in her reading, then we can calculate it as follows: Number of extra pages = Total number of exercises - Number of exercises in reading = 4 (more pages) - 7 (homework pages) = -3 pages So, if Rachel makes 7 pages of homework, there will be 3 fewer pages than the number of exercises she had in her reading.
Response:  If Rachel can do 8 math problems in 1 minute, and she wants to do 3 times as many problems as on reading, then she will be able to do 24 math problems in 1 minute (3 x 8 = 24).
Response:  If we want to make the reading longer than eight pages, we need to know how many additional pages are needed. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of additional pages = Total number of pages - 8 pages = x pages Where x is the number of additional pages needed. Now, we can find out how many sides each page has by dividing the number of pages by the number of sides per page: Sides per page = Number of pages / Number of sides per page = x / (Number of sides per page) Since there are 4 sides in a standard A4 paper, we can convert the number of sides per page to a decimal value by multiplying it by 4: Number of sides per page = 4 √ó (x / x) = 4x / x Therefore, if we want to make the reading longer than eight pages, we need 4x/x additional pages, where x is the number of additional pages needed.
"Response:  If Rachel has to do a math lesson of 10 pages and she wants to make more exercises than in the given example, then we can assume that she will add an equal number of exercises to each page. So, if she adds 3 extra exercises per page, she will have:

Number of pages x Number of exercises per page = Total number of exercises
= 10 pages x 3 exercises/page = 30 exercises

Therefore, if Rachel wants to make more exercises than in the given example, she will need to create at least 30 exercises for her math lesson."
Response:  Firstly, Rachel has to do two assignments in math, which means she will have 2 x 10 = 20 points for math. Secondly, she has to do three reading comprehensions, each worth 5 points, so that's an additional 3 x 5 = 15 points for reading. Thirdly, she has to do ten essays in biology, each worth 10 points, so that's an additional 10 x 10 = 100 points for biology. Therefore, the total number of points is 20 + 15 + 100 = 145 points.
Response:  If Rachel has to do 9 pages of math work, and she can handle 2 pages of reading per day, then it will take her 4.5 days (9 / 2 = 4.5) to finish all 9 pages of math work. However, if she spends too much time on math work, she might not have enough time for other subjects like biology, which requires 96 pages of work. So, in total, it will take Rachel around 10 days (4.5 + 96 / 2 = 10) to complete all 104 pages of work assigned to her.
Response:  If Rachel has to do 11 pages of math, and each page takes her 2 hours to complete, then she will need 22 hours to finish all 11 pages of math (11 x 2 = 22).  Similarly, if she has to read 2 pages of text and it takes her 1 hour to read each page, then she will need 2 hours to finish both pages of reading (2 x 1 = 2). And if she has to study 3 pages of biology and it takes her 1.5 hours to study each page, then she will need 4.5 hours to finish all 3 pages of biology (3 x 1.5 = 4.5). Therefore, in total, Rachel needs 26.5 hours to finish all three subjects (22 + 2 + 4.5 = 26.5).
Response:  If Rachel has to do 7 pages of math work and 11 pages of reading comprehension, that means she has done a total of 18 pages of academic work.  As for biology, if she has to do 8 pages of work in that subject, then she has learned about biology for 8/18 = 0.44 or approximately 26% of her overall academic work.
Response:  If Rachel had to do 9 pages of math work and 11 pages of reading comprehension, that means she did 9 + 11 = 20 pages of academic work in total. Since there are 29 pages of biology work, we can conclude that Rachel did not complete all of her math and reading assignments. Therefore, the answer is 20/29 = 0.74 or approximately 3/4.
Response:  If Rachel has to make an eight-page math assignment and a seven-page reading comprehension assignment, she will have to write a total of 15 pages (8 + 7).
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 5 tasks in math and 6 tasks in biology, that means she had to do 5 + 6 = 11 tasks in total. Since we are asked how many pages of notes and exercises she would have received if she did all these tasks, the answer is 11 pages.
"Response:  If Rachel has to do two tasks per page with reading and four tasks per page with math work, then she will have to do:

Reading tasks: 2 x 5 = 10 pages
Math work tasks: 4 x 5 = 20 pages
Total number of pages: 10 + 20 = 30 pages
Therefore, Rachel will have to do 30 pages of work in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to make exercises in four subjects, which means she needs to do 4 x 20 = 80 exercises in total. Then, we are given that she has to do 7 exercises in math and 19 exercises in biology, so she needs to do 7 + 19 = 26 exercises in these two subjects combined. Therefore, the total number of exercises Rachel needs to do is 80 + 26 = 106 exercises.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 6 emails. So, the answer is 6.
"Response:  We know that Jack received 4 mails in the morning and 8 mails in the afternoon. So, we have:
Morning: 4 mails
Afternoon: 8 mails
Total number of mails received by Jack = Morning + Afternoon = 4 + 8 = 12
Therefore, Jack received more mails in the afternoon than he did in the morning."
Response:  If Jack receives 5 emails per day and he works from morning till afternoon (8 hours), then in one day he will receive 5 x 8 = 40 emails.
Response:  If Jack receives 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the evening, he has received a total of 9 emails that day (4 + 5 = 9).
Response:  If Jack received 8 emails in the morning and 72 emails in the evening, then he received a total of 8 + 72 = 80 emails. So, the answer is 80.
Response:  If Jack sends emails at 5 am and 8 pm every day, then he will send 2 emails per day (1 in the morning and 1 in the evening). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  Jack goes for a run four times in the morning and eight times in the evening. So, how many runs does Jack go for in total?  We can calculate this as follows: Morning runs = 4 x 1 hour = 4 hours Evening runs = 8 x 1 hour = 8 hours Total running time = 4 + 8 = 12 hours Therefore, Jack goes for a total of 12 hours of running per day.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, we can write:
Morning = 10 emails
Afternoon = 7 emails
Now, let's compare the number of emails Jack received in the morning with the number he received in the afternoon:
Number of emails received in the morning - Number of emails received in the afternoon = 10 - 7 = 3
Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
Response:  If Jack sends an email at 8 am and then again at 5 pm, he will have sent a total of 2 emails that day (1 in the morning + 1 in the evening). So, the answer is 2.
Response:  According to the question, Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon (10 - 5 = 5). So, the answer is yes, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the evening.
"Response:  If Jack receives 10 emails per day and he checks his email every morning (3 miles), afternoon (2 miles), and evening (1 mile), then we can calculate how many emails he will receive in total each day as follows:

Morning: 3 miles x 10 emails/day = 30 emails received in the morning
Afternoon: 2 miles x 10 emails/day = 20 emails received in the afternoon
Evening: 1 mile x 10 emails/day = 10 emails received in the evening
Total number of emails received per day = 30 + 20 + 10 = 60 emails
Therefore, if Jack receives 10 emails per day, he will receive approximately 60 emails in total each day."
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 67 messages (emails + letters). Then, he received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon, so he received a total of 109 messages (emails + letters) that day. Therefore, Jack has received approximately 109 mails per day.
Response:  Jack received 8 emails and 7 letters that morning. Then he received 9 emails and 6 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 17 (8 + 9) emails and 13 (7 + 6) letters per day.
Response:  Morning = 10 miles and 12 letters.  Afternoon = 3 mails and 44 letters. So, in the morning, Jack received 10 miles + 12 letters = 22 units of distance/letters. In the afternoon, he received 3 mails + 44 letters = 47 units of distance/letters. Therefore, Jack received more mail in the afternoon than in the morning (by 5 units).
Response:  Morning = 8 brev (Jack received 8 letters in the morning) Evening = 2 emails + 7 letters (Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters in the evening) Total number of letters Jack received = 8 + 2 + 7 = 17 So, many more letters were sent to Jack in the morning than he received in the evening.
Response:  If Jack sent out 74 emails in the evening and received 2 emails during that time, then he must have sent out a total of 76 emails (74 + 2).  Therefore, Jack has sent an average of 76/2 = 38 emails per day.
Response:  Jack received six emails in the morning and sent eight letters in the afternoon. So, if we divide the number of emails he received (6) by the number of letters he sent (8), we get... (do calculation)...which equals 0.75. Therefore, Jack has sent approximately 0.75 mails per day.
Response:  If Jack receives 7 emails in the morning and one more email in the afternoon, he will receive a total of 8 emails. Therefore, the correct answer is (8).
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received five emails in the morning and six emails in the evening. So, we have:
Morning: 5 emails
Evening: 6 emails
Total number of emails Jack received = Morning + Evening = 5 + 6 = 11 emails
Therefore, many more emails were sent to Jack in the morning than he received in the evening."
Response:  If Jack received 6 emails in the morning and one more in the evening, that means he received a total of 7 emails during the daytime (morning + evening).  Since he receives 10 emails per day on average, we can calculate the number of emails he received after lunch as follows:  Number of emails after lunch = Total number of emails / Average number of emails per day = 7 / 10 = 3.5  So, Jack received approximately 3.5 emails after lunch.
Response:  Grossaugeren (the frog) hopped 12 times and Grasshopper (the grasshopper) hopped 9 times. To find out how far Groda (the frog) hopped more than Grasshopper, we need to subtract the number of hops that Grasshopper made from the number of hops that Groda made. So, the difference between their numbers of hops is: 12 - 9 = 3. Therefore, Groda hopped 3 times further than Grasshopper.
Response:  Grasshopper can jump 10 cm and frog can jump 10 cm as well. So, they both have jumped the same distance. Therefore, their combined distance of jumping is 0 cm (or 0 meters).
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) jumped 14 cm, and frog jumped 17 inches longer than grasshopper, which is equal to 43 cm. Mouse also jumped 15 inches longer than frog, which is equal to 49 cm. So, in total, the distance traveled by all three animals was: Grasshopper + Frog + Mouse = 14 + 43 + 49 = 106 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that grasshopper (gresshoppa) jumped 8 cm. Then, we are told that frog (frosken) jumped 18 cm more than grasshopper. Therefore, frog jumped 10 cm (18 - 8). Now, we are also given that mouse (musen) jumped 2 cm more than frog. So, mouse jumped 12 cm (10 + 2). Thus, the distance traveled by mouse is 12 cm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that frog (grasshopper) jumped 19 cm and mouse jumped 20 cm. So, in one jump, frog jumped farther than mouse by 1 cm. Now, let's calculate how many jumps it would take for mouse to catch up with frog. We can assume that both frog and mouse make equal number of jumps. Therefore, we have: Distance = Number of jumps x Jump distance For frog, distance = 19 cm For mouse, distance = 20 cm Now, we need to find out how many jumps it would take for mouse to cover the distance of 1 cm. Since mouse jumps 20 cm per jump, it will take 1/20 = 0.05 jumps for mouse to cover 1 cm. Therefore, it will take 19 / 0.05 = 380 jumps for mouse to catch up with frog. So, after 380 jumps, mouse will be as far ahead of frog as frog was initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that grasshopper (gresshoppa) jumped 19 cm. Then, frog (frosken) jumped 40 cm more than grasshopper, so it jumped 69 cm (40 + 19). Next, mouse (musen) jumped 94 cm less than frog, so it jumped 256 cm (69 - 94). Therefore, the total distance traveled by all three animals during their race was 256 + 69 = 325 cm.
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) hops 8 cm. Frosk (frog) jumps 32 cm more than grasshopper and mouse jumps 26 cm less than frog. How far away is the mouse from the starting point?
Response:  We know that Grasshopper jumped 24 times from where he was first.  Frogs jumped 10 cm longer than grasshoppers and mice jumped 10 cm shorter than frogs. So, if we calculate the distance traveled by each animal separately, we get:  Distance traveled by Grasshopper = Number of jumps x Jump length (in cm) = 24 x 20 = 480 cm  Distance traveled by Frog = Number of jumps x Jump length (in cm) = 10 x 30 + 90 = 570 cm  Distance traveled by Mouse = Number of jumps x Jump length (in cm) = 10 x 20 + 80 = 460 cm Now, let's find out how far Muscle came compared to Grasshopper: Distance traveled by Muscle = Total distance traveled by all animals - Distance traveled by Grasshopper = 570 cm - 480 cm = 90 cm Therefore, Muscle came 90 cm further than Grasshopper.
Response:  The first frog jumped 13 inches (or 7-8 cm), and then it jumped an additional 5 cm. So, in total, the first frog jumped 18 cm (or 7 inches). Now, let's calculate how far the second frog jumped. Since the second frog jumped farther than the first one, we can assume that its distance traveled was greater than 18 cm. Therefore, the answer is: 23 cm (or 9 inches).
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 10 meters high (or 32 feet) and the frog jumped 4 inches longer than that (or 5 feet). So, in total, they both jumped approximately 37 meters or 121 feet.
Response:  Gresshoppa (grasshopper) can jump 19 inches, frog (frosken) can jump 44 inches, and mouse (musen) can jump 4 inches less than frog. So, if gresshoppa jumps 19 inches, frog jumps 44 inches, and mouse jumps 4 inches less than frog, then how far will it come together?  The total distance traveled by all three animals is equal to the sum of their individual distances. Therefore, we have: Distance = Grasshopper + Frog + Mouse = 19 + 44 - 4 = 61 inches.
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) hops 38 cm. Frosk (frog) jumps 19 cm more than grasshopper and mouse jumps 12 cm less than frog. How far is the mouse from the starting point?
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) jumped 70 cm, frog jumped 25 cm more than grasshopper and mouse jumped 16 cm less than frog. How far did grasshopper go compared to mouse?  Grasshopper went further than mouse by 49 cm (70 - 21 = 49).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that frog (Grasa) jumped 18 cm and grasshopper (Gresshopp) jumped 18 cm as well. Now, let's calculate how far each of them can jump in one leap. We do this by dividing their length by their jump distance. For frog, its length is 18 cm, so it can jump 18/1 = 18 cm per leap. Similarly, for grasshopper, its length is also 18 cm, so it can jump 18/1 = 18 cm per leap. Since both are able to jump the same distance, neither of them can jump further than the other. Therefore, the answer is ""They jumped the same distance""."
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) jumps 9 inches from one place to another. Mouse jumps 5 centimeters lower than frog which jumps 10 centimeters further than grasshopper. How far is mouse away from the starting point?
Response:  Gresshopper (grasshopper) hops 14 times higher than his height before he was born. Mouse jumps 10 cm lower than the frog who jumps 10 cm further than grasshopper. How far is the mouse from the ground?  The distance from the ground to where the mouse is can be calculated as follows: Grasshopper hops x times = y meters High point of jump = z meters Distance from ground to high point = y - z meters Now we know that the grasshopper hops 14 times higher than his height before he was born, so: y = 14x And since the mouse jumps 10 cm lower than the frog, who jumps 10 cm further than the grasshopper: z = x + 10 So now we have two equations and two unknowns: y and z We can solve for y using the first equation: y = 14x Substituting this into the second equation gives us: z = x + 10 Solving for x gives us: x = 7 m Since the mouse is 7 meters away from the ground, the correct answer is: Kor langt lenger kom musen enn gresshoppa = 7 meters
Response:  If Mary has given you five cups of flour and the recipe requires 14 cups, then she is missing three cups of flour. Now, if we divide the total amount of flour required (14 cups) by the amount of flour Mary gave you (5 cups), we get 2.8. So, to fill up the remaining quantity of flour needed for the recipe, you will need approximately 3 glasses or 3 x 0.2 = 0.6 cups of flour more than what Mary provided.
Response:  If Mary has already added 4 cups of flour (which is equal to 4 x 8 = 32 oz), and the recipe calls for 9 cups of flour in total, then she still needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour (equal to 6 x 8 = 48 oz). Therefore, if Mary wants to make the cake according to the recipe, she will need to add another 48 oz of sugar (since each cup of flour requires 1 cup of sugar). So, the correct answer is 48 oz.
Response:  If Mary has added more flour than sugar as instructed in the recipe, then she will need to add more flour than sugar if she wants to maintain the same proportion of ingredients. So, if she needs 8 glasses more flour than sugar, that means she needs 8 x 6 = 48 grams of flour for every 13 grams of sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is 48/13 = 3.57.
Response:  If Mary has added more flour than sugar as instructed in the recipe, then she will have too much flour and not enough sugar. To determine how many extra cups of flour Mary has, we can divide the amount of excess flour (in this case, 4 cups) by the number of cups of flour called for in the recipe (11 cups). So, Mary has 4/11 = 0.36 or approximately 36% too much flour.
Response:  If Mary has given you three cups of sugar and the recipe calls for half a cup of sugar, then she has given you too much sugar. To find out how many cups of sugar the recipe actually needs, we can divide the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe (11 cups) by the amount of sugar Mary gave you (3 cups). So, the recipe needs 6 cups of sugar.
Response:  If Mary needs 12 cups of flour for the recipe and she added extra glasses of flour, then she actually has more than enough flour to make the cake. So if she needs two additional cups of flour, that means she has 14 cups of flour in total (12 + 2 = 14).
Response:  We know that Mary has already added three cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar according to the recipe. To find out how many cups of flour she needs to add in total, we can use the following equation: Total amount of flour = Original amount of flour + Additional amount of flour needed = 3 cups + (Required amount of flour - Amount already added) = 3 cups + (9 cups - 3 cups) = 3 cups + 6 cups = 9 cups So, Mary needs to add 9 cups of flour more to complete the recipe.
"Response:  If we have 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar as given in the problem, then according to the recipe, we need 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar for the cake. So, if we want to make the cake, we must add more sugar than what is already there. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Yes, she needs to add many glasses of sugar""."
Response:  We know that Mary has put 11 glasses of flour in the bowl and the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many glasses of flour are left after adding 12 cups. To do this, we divide the total number of glasses (11) by the number of cups required (12): 11 / 12 = 0.92 or approximately 1 cup. Therefore, Mary needs to add one more glass of flour to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has added 7 cups of flour to the bowl and the recipe calls for 10 cups in total, then she still needs 3 more cups of flour. To find out how many glasses of flour she will need, we can divide the remaining amount of flour (3 cups) by the volume of each cup (about 450 grams). So, Mary will need approximately 1350 grams of flour to fill up the bowl.
"Response:  We know that we need 12 cups of flour for the recipe and Mary has given us 2 cups less than that (10 cups). To find out how much more salt we need, we can use the following formula:

More salt needed = Total amount of salt required - Amount of salt provided
= 7 cups - 2 cups
= 5 cups

So, we need 5 cups more salt than what Mary has given us."
"Response:  We know that the recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. Since Mary has given you 5 cups of flour (which is equal to 120 grams), we can calculate how much sugar and salt she needs to add based on the amount of flour available.
To do this, we need to divide the total amount of sugar and salt needed by the amount of flour available. For sugar, we have:
8 cups x 120 grams/cup = 960 grams of sugar needed
Since Mary has only given you 5 cups of flour, we need to multiply the amount of sugar needed by the ratio of flour to sugar in the recipe:
960 grams / 3:4 = 240 grams of sugar needed
Similarly, for salt, we have:
7 cups x 60 grams/cup = 420 grams of salt needed
Since Mary has only given you 5 cups of flour, we need to multiply the amount of salt needed by the ratio of flour to salt in the recipe:
420 grams / 3:4 = 130 grams of salt needed
Therefore, Mary needs an additional 130 grams of salt to complete the recipe."
Response:  If Mary has added two cups of sugar instead of 13, then she will need to add more than one cup of sugar to balance it out. Specifically, she needs to add 9 cups of sugar (13 - 2 = 9).
Response:  If Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the batter and the recipe calls for six cups of sugar, then she still needs to add two more cups of sugar (6 - 4 = 2). Therefore, the correct answer is 2 cups of flour.
Response:  If Mary has given you two cups of flour (which is equivalent to 180 grams), and the recipe calls for 6 cups or 432 grams of flour in total, then you will need to add an additional 252 grams of flour to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 252 grams.
Response:  If the recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and Mary has added 11 cups of molasses (which is equivalent to 5.5 cups of sugar), then she needs an additional 3.5 cups of sugar to complete the recipe. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  If Mary needs 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour for the recipe, and she has added some extra flour, then she will need 5 cups of flour to make up for the excess flour she added. So, if she needs 5 cups of flour to balance out the amount of flour in the recipe, how many cups of sugar can she add without exceeding the maximum amount of sugar called for in the recipe? The answer is 2 cups of sugar (3 - 5 = 2).
Response:  If Mary needs 12 cups of flour and she added many extra cups, then... (1)...she has more than enough flour to make the cake (2)...the number of excess cups is equal to the amount needed for the recipe (3)...so if she needs 12 cups and she added x cups, then x = 12 (4)...therefore, Mary added 12 - x cups of flour beyond what was required for the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar as per the recipe, then she needs to add 7 - 6 = 1 cup more of flour to make up for the mistake. Since each cup of flour makes 4 cups of dough, Mary will need an additional 4 / 4 = 1 cup of dough to compensate for the error. Therefore, if many glasses with milk should be made, the correct answer is 1 cup.
Response:  If Mary has added 12 cups of sugar and only needs 11 cups for the recipe, then she will need to add one cup less than what she has already added. Therefore, Mary will need to add 11 - 12 = -1 cups of sugar. Since this is a negative number, it means that Mary does not need to add any more sugar to her mixture.
Response:  If we have 6 cups of flour (which is more than the recipe calls for), and the recipe says to use 3 cups of sugar, then we will need to add more sugar to balance out the amount of flour. So, if we want to make sure that the cake turns out right, we should add an additional 3 cups of sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is 9 glasses of milk (3 + 3 = 6).
Response:  If Mary needs 9 cups of sugar for her cake recipe and she has already added 4 cups of flour (mj√∏l), then she still needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour (mj√∏l) to complete the recipe. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 cups of flour (mj√∏l).
"Response:  We know that we need 9 cups of sugar for the recipe and Mary has given us 2 cups of molasses instead. To find out how much more molasses we need than salt, we can use the following formula:

More molasses = Salt - (Sugar / 2)

In this case, the number of cups of salt is 4, so we can plug in those values into the formula:

More molasses = 4 - (9 / 2)
= 4 - 4.5
= -0.5

So, we need 0.5 cups of molasses less than salt."
"Response:  We know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and 6 cups of flour. If Mary has added 12 balls of flour (which is equal to 304 grams), then she still needs to add 8 more cups of flour (or 227 grams) to reach the total amount needed in the recipe. As for salt, we are not given any information about how much salt Mary has already added, so it is impossible to determine whether she needs more or less salt without additional information. Therefore, the correct answer is ""We don't know."""
Response:  If Mary has already added four cups of sugar to the batter and the recipe calls for seven cups total, then she will need to add three more cups of sugar (seven - four = three). So, yes, Mary needs to add many glasses of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  If Mary has added ten sugar syrup to the recipe that calls for 12 cups of sugar, then she will need 2 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe. Therefore, the correct answer is 14 cups of sugar (the original amount called for in the recipe).
Response:  We know that there are 19 bird families at this mountain during winter and 60 birds flew away to warmer lands. So, we can assume that 41 birds (60 - 19) stayed behind in the mountain. Therefore, more than half of the birds (51%) stayed back in the mountain rather than flying away to warmer lands.
Response:  If there are 87 bird families in the area and 7 of them fly away to warmer lands during winter, then how many bird families remain in the area?  To find out, we can divide 80 (the number of bird families remaining) by 7 (the number of bird families that flew away). So, approximately 11 bird families remained in the area during winter.
Response:  Firstly, we know that most animals migrate to warmer lands during winter. However, some birds and mammals can be found in higher altitudes like mountains.  According to the text, 20 bird families flew away to escape the cold weather while only 14 bird families remained near the mountains. So, the answer is 20 - 14 = 6. Therefore, six bird families lived near the mountains during the winter.
Response:  We know that 85 bird families are present in the area and we want to find out how many of them migrate to Africa or Asia.  We also know that 23 bird families migrated to Africa and 37 to Asia. So, if many birds were sitting near their migration routes, then we can assume that some of these birds might be sitting close to each other.  Therefore, the answer is:  Many (around 60) bird families.
Response:  If 42 birds migrate to Africa and 31 birds migrate to Asia, then we have a total of 73 birds that migrated away from their original location near the mountains (8 families x 42 birds = 336 birds). Now, let's calculate how many birds are left in the area near the mountains: 8 families x 5 birds per family = 40 birds remaining near the mountains. So, out of all the birds that were originally there, only 40 birds remained near the mountains after migration.
Response:  If 47 birds flew to Africa and 94 birds flew to Asia, then we can say that the total number of birds flying to Asia is 94 + 47 = 141. Therefore, many bird families flew to Asia.
"Response:  If 38 birds flew to Africa and 80 birds flew to Asia, that means there are 38 + 80 = 118 birds left in the area. Since winter is almost here and most animals migrate to warmer lands, it can be assumed that many bird families will also migrate. So, the number of bird families that will fly away to escape the cold weather can be estimated as follows:

Let X be the number of bird families that will fly away to warm places during winter.

Since the total number of bird families in the area is 18, we can write:
X = 18 - (38 + 80) = 18 - 118 = -100

Therefore, the answer to the question is -100."
"Response:  If there are currently 87 bird families in the nearby area of this mountain and 18 new bird families were built, then we can calculate the percentage increase as follows:

Percentage Increase = (New Bird Families / Total Existing Bird Families) x 100
= (18 / 87) x 100
= 20.4%

So, approximately 20.4% of the total existing bird families would be affected if 18 new bird families were built near this mountain."
Response:  We know that 59 birds flew away to warmer lands and 24 new birds came from the Arctic region to nearby areas. So, the total number of birds present at the mountain is: 59 + 24 = 83 birds. Therefore, many bird families are present on the mountain.
"Response:  If initially there were 41 bird families that nested near the mountain and flew away for winter to warmer lands, and now only 27 are left, then we can calculate the number of birds that migrated as follows:

Number of birds that migrated = Initial number of birds - Number of birds remaining
= 41 - 27
= 14

Therefore, 14 bird families migrated from the mountain to warmer lands for winter."
Response:  If initially there were 45 bird families that nested on the mountain and 86 of them flew away for winter, then we can assume that 86 - 45 = 41 bird families remained on the mountain during winter.
"Response:  If 35 birds flew to Asia and 62 birds flew to Africa, then we have:

Total number of birds that flew away = 35 + 62 = 97

Now, let's find out how many bird families remained in the area:

Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that flew away
= 41 - 97 = -56

So, many bird families flew to Africa."
Response:  We know that there are three bird families at this mountain and they migrate according to the season. In winter, most birds move southwards while in summer, some birds from the Arctic come to the mountain. So, we can say that during winter, 26 new bird families will arrive near the mountain, while two bird families will fly further south to spend their winter after. Now, the question is how many bird families are present on the mountain? To find out, we need to add the number of bird families that are already there (three) with the number of new bird families that arrive during winter (26). Therefore, the answer is 3 + 26 = 29 bird families present on the mountain during winter.
Response:  We know that Paul has 253 colored pencils and he gives away 70 of them during the year. So, we can say that after giving away some pencils, he still has x number of pencils left. Now, we are told that he has more than half of the original number of pencils (x > 1/2 * 253). Therefore, we can conclude that he must have at least 126 colored pencils left after giving away some (x >= 126).
"Response:  We know that Paul gave away $551 per day and had only $177 left at the end of the year. So he spent more than he earned in a day. Now we need to find out how many days he spent money without earning it back. To do this, we divide his total spending ($551) by his daily income ($177):

$551 / $177 = 3.09 days

So Paul spent approximately 3.09 days worth of money without earning it back during the year."
Response:  We know that Paul has 440 small colored plates in his box and gives away 111 of them to his friends during the year. This means he has 329 plates left (440 - 111 = 329). Then we are told that he loses 106 of these plates. So, at the end of the year, Paul has 223 plates left (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, the correct answer is 223.
Response:  If Paul had 65 small colored plates and gave 213 crosses to his friends, then he must have lost 16 of them. So, the number of remaining plates is: 65 - 16 = 49. Therefore, many of the plates were given away (213 - 16 = 207), but some were also lost (16).
Response:  We know that Paul has $589 in his piggy bank and he gave away $571 crosses to his friends during the year. So, he lost $161 crosses himself. Now we need to find out how many more dollars he gave away than he lost. To do this, we can subtract the amount he lost from the total amount he had: $$$589 - $161 = $428$$$. Therefore, Paul gave away more dollars ($428) than he lost ($161).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paul had $110 to spend for his birthday. Then, he gave away $90 of it to his friends throughout school. So, he was left with $20 ($110 - $90). Next, he lost $412 in betting. Therefore, the number of dollars he has lost is greater than the amount he gave away to his friends. In other words, he has lost more money than he gave away. So, the correct answer is: More than $90.
Response:  If Paul has given away 563 crosses to his friends and lost 558 crosses himself, then he must have started with at least 332 crosses (since he cannot give away or lose more than what he has). Therefore, the number of crosses Paul had left after his birthday celebrations is: 332 - 558 = -226.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away $52 to his friends and lost $535. So he has $587 left (535 - 52 = 587). Now we are asked if he had 492 bracelets remaining after some of them were lost. Since we don't know how many bracelets were lost, let's assume that he had 492 bracelets initially. Therefore, the number of bracelets he had remaining is equal to the initial amount minus the amount he gave away: 492 - 52 = 440 bracelets.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 colored plates and 66 rubber bands from Benny for his birthday. At the end of the year, he had 154 left. So, we can conclude that some of them were given away or lost. But how many exactly? Well, if we assume that Paul gave away or lost an equal number of plates as he had at the beginning (521), then we can calculate the number of plates he had left at the end of the year as follows: Number of plates left = Initial number of plates - (Initial number of plates x Percentage given away/lost) = 521 - (521 x 0.5) = 296 plates Therefore, Paul had 296 colored plates left at the end of the year.
"Response:  We know that Paul started with $531 and spent $38 on gifts. At the end of the year, he was left with $391. So, we can write an equation:

$531 - $38 = $391

Now, let's solve for the number of pens (or any other item) he had at the end of the year:

$391 / $38 = x

x = 10

So, Paul had 10 pens left at the end of the year."
Response:  We know that Paul has $336 left after buying the gift for his wife's birthday. If he spent $601 on pens and $406 on gum, then he must have started with at least $601 + $406 = $1007. So, he has $1007 - $336 = $671 remaining. Therefore, he has 671 gumballs more than he started with.
"Response:  We know that Paul has 291 pens at the end of the year and he lost or gave away 315 pens during the year. So, we can calculate how many pens he had left after giving them away as follows:  Number of pens left = Total number of pens - Number of pens given away = 291 - 315 = -84 To find out if many colored pens he had left, we need to check whether the result is positive or negative. If it's positive, then he had some colored pens left; otherwise, he didn't have any. In this case, since the result is negative (-84), Paul did not have any colored pens left for his birthday."
"Response:  We know that Paul has $267 to spend for his birthday and he spent $231 on presents and $308 on going out with friends. So, we can calculate how much money he had left over as follows:
$267 - $231 = $36 (money left over)
Now, let's see if he gave more money away than he had left over:
$36 - $308 = $-302 (he didn't have enough money to give away all of it)
So, the correct answer is: He gave away less money than he had left over."
Response:  We know that Paul started with 457 rubber bands and 320 colored poms. At the end of the year, he had 523 left. So, we can calculate how many more rubber bands he had than colored poms as follows: Number of rubber bands = 523 - 320 = 203 Number of colored poms = 457 - 320 = 137 Therefore, there were 137 more colored poms than rubber bands at the end of the year.
Response:  If there were initially 11 customers and after one of them left, there were 3 remaining customers, then we can calculate the average number of customers as follows:  Average Number of Customers = (Initial Number of Customers - Number of Remaining Customers) / Initial Number of Customers  In this case, the initial number of customers was 11, and the number of remaining customers was 3. So, the average number of customers would be:  Average Number of Customers = (11 - 3) / 11 = 0.73 or approximately 73%  Therefore, it seems that more than half of the original number of customers have left the service provider.
"Response:  If the server initially had 3 customers and after some of them left, he had 4 customers remaining in the city, then we can say that the number of customers who left the city is equal to the difference between the initial number of customers and the final number of customers. So, the number of customers who left the city is:

$$ = 3 - 4 = -1 $$

Therefore, many customers were sitting in the city."
Response:  If there were initially 9 customers and after 4 of them left, there were still 12 customers remaining, then the number of customers he started with must have been 12 x 4 = 48.
Response:  If there were 14 customers and now he has 5 customers left, then we can calculate how many customers he lost as follows: Number of customers lost = Total number of customers - Current number of customers Number of customers lost = 14 - 5 = 9 So, the servitor lost 9 customers.
Response:  At first, he had 13 customers. After some of them left, he gained four new customers. So, how many customers did he have in total?  Total number of customers = Number of original customers + Number of new customers  Total number of customers = 13 + 4  Total number of customers = 17
Response:  If he had 12 customers initially and then got 15 new ones, that means he gained 3 more customers (from 15 - 12 = 3). So, the number of customers he has now is 12 + 3 = 15. Therefore, he has 15 customers in total.
Response:  The servant initially had 3 customers. After some time, he gained 5 more customers, so now he has 8 customers in total (3 + 5 = 8). Therefore, many new customers are not coming to the net.
Response:  At first, there were 8 customers. Then some of them went away, leaving 5 customers. Later, he got 99 new customers. So, in total, how many customers did he have?  Answer:  The number of customers the server had is equal to the sum of the initial number of customers (8) plus the number of customers left after some went away (5) plus the number of new customers gained (99). Therefore, the final answer is: 8 + 5 + 99 = 102 customers.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Then some of them left, leaving him with 14 customers. So, he has more customers now than he did initially. Therefore, the answer is 14 - 12 = 2.
Response:  If Dan has $3 after buying a chocolate bar for $2, then he must have started with at least $5 ($3 - $2 = $1). So, the correct answer is $5.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has $4 in his hand. Then he spent $3 on a chocolate bar. So now he has $4 - $3 = $1 left. Therefore, it cost him $1 for the chocolate bar.
Response:  We know that Dan has $4 in his hand and he bought 99 small cars for $3 each quarter. So, he spent a total of $3 x 99 = $297. Therefore, the number of dollars Dan has left is $4 - $297 = $-293.
Response:  If Dan has $3 and bought 2 candy bars for $4 each, he spent a total of $8. So, if he wants to buy another candy bar, it will cost him half of that amount, which is $4. Therefore, the next candy bar will cost him $4.
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 in his pocket and he spent $6 on a chocolate bar. So, he is left with $2 - $6 = -$4. Now we are asked how many chocolate bars he bought. But, since he spent more than he had, he didn't buy any chocolate bars! Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  If Dan has $7 in his hand and he bought one chocolate bar for $2 and another for $3, then he spent a total of $5 = $2 + $3. So, he still has $7 - $5 = $2 left with him.
"Response: 
Dan had $4 to start with and spent $7 + $6 = $13 on candy and chocolate. So he has $4 - $13 = -$9 left after buying the candy and chocolate. Therefore, Dan did not have enough money to buy both candies and chocolates."
Response:  If Dan has $2 and he bought one chocolate bar for $6 and another for $3, then he spent a total of $6 + $3 = $9 on buying chocolate bars. So, the answer is $9.
Response:  If Dan has $5 in his hand and he bought one chocolate bar for $2 and another for $3, then he spent a total of $2 + $3 = $5 on buying chocolate bars. So, the answer is $5.
"Response: 
Dan has $4 in his hand initially.  He spent $8 on a chocolate bar, so now he has $4 - $8 = $-4 left.  Therefore, many people have -$4."
Response:  If Dan had $3 left after buying one chocolate bar, and he has $4 in his pocket now, then he has a total of $7 ($3 + $4). So, it will cost him $7 for one more chocolate bar.
"Response:  If Dan has $4 in his hand and he spent $3 for ten lollipops that cost half a million dollars each, then...

1. The total amount of money Dan spent is $3 x 10 = $30.
2. So, he still has $4 - $30 = $1 left in his hand.

Therefore, the answer to the question ""How much money does Dan have?"" is $1."
Response:  We know that Dan has $3 and he spent $2 on 2 candy bars which are approximately equal in price. So, we can assume that each candy bar cost him $1. Now, if he wants to buy one more chocolate bar, it will cost him $\$1$. Therefore, the cost of one additional chocolate bar is $\$1$.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $3 to buy one chocolate bar. Then he spent $7 to buy another candy bar. So in total, Dan spent $3 + $7 = $10. Therefore, Dan spent $10 on buying candy bars and not on buying chocolate bars.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $7 to buy one chocolate bar and $2 to buy another candy. So he spent a total of $9. Therefore, Dan spent more money buying chocolate than candy. The correct answer is (A) More money was spent buying chocolate.
Response:  We know that Paul had 115 books initially. Then he sold 78 books online. So, how many books does he have left? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the total number of books he had. Therefore, the answer is:  Books remaining = Total books - Sold books = 115 - 78 = 37 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had 137 books in a garage sale and after selling 105 of them he was left with 32 books. So, at the beginning, Paul had more than 32 books.
"Response:  We know that Paul initially had 108 books and after selling some of them at a bookstore, he had 62 books left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of books Paul sold at the bookstore.

We know that the total number of books Paul had initially was 108, so we can write:

x + 62 = 108... (1)

Now, we are also given that Paul gave 35 books to his friend. So, we can subtract 35 from the total number of books Paul had:

x - 35 = 62... (2)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 73

So, Paul sold 73 books at the bookstore."
Response:  We know that Paul started with 50 books and after buying some more at the store he has $151 left over. So we can write an equation based on this information: Number of books = Initial number of books + Amount spent at store (in dollars) - Total amount left over (in dollars) Now let's plug in the values given in the question: Number of books = 50 + x - 151 Where x is the amount Paul spent at the store. To find out how much Paul spent at the store, we need to solve for x in the above equation. Based on the information provided, we know that x = 25 (since Paul spent $25 at the store). Therefore, the answer is: Number of books = 50 + 25 - 151 = 76 books.
Response:  If Paul sold some books at a bookstore and then bought 150 new ones, he must have had some books before buying those new ones. So, let's say he had x books initially. Then, after selling some of them, he had x - y books left. Now, if he bought 150 new books, he has x + 150 books now. Therefore, the number of books he sold is equal to the difference between the initial number of books he had (x) and the total number of books he has now (x + 150): x = 58.
Response:  If Paul initially had 21 books and sold some of them at a store, then he has fewer books left.  We are not told how many books he sold, so we can assume that he sold half of his original number (10.5 books). Now, he buys 42 new books, which means he has a total of 52 books (including both old and new ones). Finally, if he has 15 books left after selling some, it means he sold 37 books in total (52 - 15 = 37). So, the correct answer is 37.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 71 books and then sold some of them on a market. Afterward, he bought 38 new books, so his total number of books is now 71 + 38 = 109. Therefore, he has sold 71 - 109 = -38 books.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 108 books and 55 pens. If he spent $200 per day writing, then he must have earned at least this amount from selling his books and pens. Therefore, we can assume that he sold at least 208 books ($200 / $1 = 208) and 55 pens (since he still has 59 pens left). So, he sold 208 books in total.
Response:  We know that Paul started with 51 books and 106 pens. He sold some of them in the garage and now has 82 books and 14 pens left. To find out how many pens he sold, we can subtract the number of pens he has left from the original number of pens he had: 106 - 14 = 92. So, Paul sold 92 pens at the mall.
Response:  If he sold none of his books and left behind 27 books, then he must have started with at least 27 + 136 = 163 books in total. So, he sold (or gave away) at most 163 - 27 = 136 books.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 134 books and gave away 39 of them to his friend. So he was left with 95 books (134 - 39 = 95). Then, after selling some of these books at the store, he had 68 books remaining (95 - x = 68), where x is the number of books he sold. Therefore, the answer is x = 27.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 95 pens and 153 books. He used no pens or books. He used ice instead. After selling some books and pens in the garage, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. So, how many books did he sell at the store?  Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Paul sold 70 books at the store (95 - 13 = 70).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Paulus had 42 pens and 143 books initially. Then he sold some of his books and pens in the garage, which reduced the number to 113 books and 19 pens. Now, if he sold all his remaining pens at the shopping center, how many pens would he have left? Therefore, the answer is 19 pens.
Response:  We know that Jessica cut eight rose blooms from her garden and put them in the vase. So, how many roses did she have in total?  Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Jessica had ten roses in her garden originally.
Response:  If there were originally 16 rose blossoms from the garden and Jessica put them in the vase, then there are now 23 roses in the vase. So, many roses did Jessica have in the vase to begin with?  Answer: 23 - 16 = 7
Response:  Jessica threw four roses into the vase and then picked some new ones from her garden and put them in the vase. So, there are 23 roses in the vase now. But how many roses had she cut?  Solution: We know that Jessica threw four roses into the vase initially, so there were 19 roses (4 + 15) left in her garden. Then, she picked some new roses from her garden and added them to the vase, making the total number of roses in the vase 23. Therefore, the answer is 16 (19 - 4).
Response:  If there were originally 15 roses in the vase and Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and then put some new roses from her garden into the vase, then the total number of roses in the vase afterward would be: 15 + (new roses from the garden) - 33 = 17 So, many more roses than she had today.
Response:  Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and then picked some new ones from her garden and put them in the vase. So, there are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses Jessica gave away, we need to subtract the number of new roses she added (15) from the original number of roses in the vase (21). Therefore, Jessica gave away 7 roses (21 - 15 = 7).
Response:  If there were originally 7 roses in the vase and Jessica clipped some from her garden that had 59 roses together, then the total number of roses she clipped is equal to the difference between the original number of roses in the vase (7) and the number of roses in her garden (59). So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of roses Jessica clipped = 7 - 59 = -52. Therefore, Jessica clipped 52 roses.
Response:  If there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica clipped some from her garden that had 12 roses together, then the total number of roses she clipped is 13 + 12 = 25 roses. So, there are 25 roses in the vase now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden. Now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. So, we can say that Jessica had cut 2 roses (15 - 17 = 2) and 34 orchids (62 - 96 = 34).
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase. So, we can conclude that Jessica had cut out 2 orchids (or 2 x 1 = 2).
Response:  We know that there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden. So, after she added them to the vase, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in it. Therefore, the answer is: Yes, many roses have I in my vase (the correct answer).
Response:  At first, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. So, the total number of orchids that Eve has at home is 20 - 12 = 8.
Response:  If there were 3 roses in the vase initially and we cut out many flowers how many would be left? So, if there are 19 roses in the vase now, then we have to subtract the initial number of roses (3) from the total number of roses (19). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden. Now, there are 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, we can conclude that Jessica had cut 7 roses (14 - 7 = 7) and 60 orchids (91 - 84 = 60).
Response:  We know that there were originally 16 roses and three orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden. Now there are 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So many orchids did she cut out?  Solution:  To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of orchids in the original vase (3) from the number of orchids after she cut them (7). Therefore, Jessica cut out 4 orchids.
Response:  We know that there were originally six roses and twenty orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some roses and orchids from her garden. Now it is said that there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses Jessica cut (6) from the total number of flowers in the vase before she cut them (28), we get 22 - 6 = 16. Therefore, many roses have I in my vase.
Response:  We know that there were originally 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her garden. So, after she added them to the vase, there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. However, we also know that many orchids have been stored in the cellar, which means they haven't been counted yet. Therefore, the correct answer is 13 + 3 = 16.
Response:  If Robin has 5 cm long hair and she cut off some more centimeters from it, then we can calculate how much she actually cut off based on the length of her original hair. So if she cut off 2 cm from her 5 cm long hair, now her hair is 3 cm long (5 - 2 = 3). Now let's check if she has 13 inches or 10 fingers on her hair. Since there are 2.54 cm in an inch, we can convert 3 cm to inches as follows: 3 cm x 2.54 cm/in = 7.64 in. And since there are 10 fingers on an average human head, Robin should have approximately 7.64 inches of hair on her head. Therefore, Robin has indeed cut off 2 cm from her initial 5 cm long hair.
Response:  If Robin cut off 20 centimeters of hair from her head and she has 10 fingers long hair, then before cutting it was ______________ (insert number) meters long.
Response:  If Robin had 45 cm long hair and cut off 17 cm, then she has 28 cm of hair left (45 - 17 = 28).  Now, if she grows 12 cm every day, how much hair will she have after one day?  We can calculate this as follows: 28 cm x 1.12 (growth per day) = 31.68 cm. So, after one day, Robin will have 31.68 cm of hair.  Therefore, her hair length is 31.68 cm.
Response:  If Robin had hair that was 7 cm long and then increased it by 20 cm, the new length of her hair would be:  7 + (20 x 10) = 7 + 200 = 207 cm   So, if Robin had hair that was 207 cm long, she would have had longer hair than before.
"Response:  If Robin cut off 13 centimeters of hair from her mane and it was originally 14 meters long, then...

The length of Robin's mane after cutting is given as $14 \text{ m} - 13 \text{ cm} = 139 \text{ cm}$.$ So, the length of Robin's mane now is $139 \text{ cm}$."
Response:  We know that Robin had hair that was 4 cm long initially. Then she cut it so that it grew up to 25 cm in length at her temples (which is where women typically have more hair growth). So after cutting off 20 cm of hair, how much longer is her hair now compared to when it was originally 4 cm long?  Therefore, the length of Robin's hair after cutting off 20 cm is:  4 cm + (25 cm - 4 cm) = 31 cm.
Response:  We know that Danny has 12 bottle necks in his collection. He found 53 bottles in the garden. So, we can say that Danny has more than 12 bottles. But how many more? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of bottle necks he had from the total number of bottles he found:  Number of bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of bottle necks  In this case, the total number of bottles is 53 and the number of bottle necks is 12. Therefore, Danny has 41 more bottles than he had bottle necks (53 - 12 = 41).
Response:  We know that Danny has 21 bottles of beer in his collection and he found some more bottles in the park. If he doesn't have 53 bottles, then how many bottles does he have altogether?  So, the answer is 21 + x, where x is the number of additional bottles found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 51 of the old bottles he found in the park. So, if he started with 63 bottles and threw away 51, then he has 12 bottles left (63 - 51 = 12). Therefore, Danny had 12 bottles at the beginning of his collection.
Response:  We know that Danny has thrown away 35 of his old bottles in the park. So he now has 22 bottles left in his collection. If we assume that all the remaining bottles are on one side of the street (the side where Danny is standing), then the number of bottles on the other side of the street would be zero. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 bottles in the park and threw away 63 of them. So he has 42 bottles left in his collection. Now we are asked how many bottles Danny gave away in total. To find this out, we need to add the number of bottles he found in the park (30) to the number of bottles he gave away (63). Therefore, the answer is: 42 + 63 = 105 bottles.
Response:  In the first part of the problem, Danny collected 22 bottles and 8 papers in the park. If he already had 28 bottles before going to the park, then we can say that he found x = 22 new bottles in the park. Now, let's find out how many bands he had initially (in the beginning). According to the problem, Danny had 63 bands in his collection after collecting the bottles from the park. So, if he didn't have any bands at all when he started, then he must have gotten y = 63 bands later on. Therefore, the total number of bottles Danny collected is 22 + x = 44, and the total number of bands he got is y + z = 63.
Response:  We know that Danny found 22 bottles and 30 papers in one package. Now he has 17 bottles and 57 bracelets at his store. So, we can calculate how many paper clips Danny had in the beginning as follows: Number of paper clips = Total number of paper clips found - Number of paper clips currently available = 30 - 57 = -27 paper clips Therefore, Danny had 27 paper clips in the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 30 bottles and 14 papers in the park. Now he has 7 bottles and 86 bracelets in his collection. So, we can calculate how many bottle caps Danny found in the park as follows:  Number of bottle caps = Total number of bottles found - Number of bottles currently possessed  Number of bottle caps = 30 - 7 = 23 Therefore, Danny found 23 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that in the park, Danny found 11 bottles and 28 papers. If he now has 68 bottles and 51 bracelets at his sale, we can calculate how many more bottles he found in the park than bracelets as follows:  Bottles (park) = 11 + 28 = 39  Bracelets (park) = 0  Bottles (salon) = 68  Bracelets (salon) = 51  Therefore, Danny found significantly more bottles than bracelets in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 71 bottles and 24 papers in the park initially. Then he collected 28 more bottles and 16 bracelets. So, the total number of bottles Danny has is: 71 + 28 = 99 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danny had 10 flasks and 62 papers in his collection initially. Then he found 2 more flasks and 43 wristbands. So, now he has 27 flasks and 43 wristbands in total. Therefore, the number of flasks Danny has is 27.
Response:  We know that Danny lost 66 bottles in the park and now has 25 bottles left in his collection. So, initially he must have had more than 25 bottles.  Therefore, the correct answer is:  More than 25 bottles
Response:  If Danny found 9 more bottles in the park after having 25 bottles in his collection earlier, then he now has 32 bottles in total (including both the ones he found and the ones he already had). So, the number of bottles he found is 32 - 25 = 7.
"Response:  We know that Danny threw away 60 old bottles and found 58 new ones. So, he now has 67 bottles in his collection. To find out how many bottles Danny had at the beginning, we can use the information that he ""had many bottles"" (mange flaskar). This means that he started with a large number of bottles, which we can assume to be greater than 60. Therefore, the correct answer is:  Many bottles = > 60."
Response:  If Danny has 60 bottles in his collection and he threw away 6 old ones in the park, then he has 60 - 6 = 54 new bottles. Since he found 50 new bottles, that means there are now 54 + 50 = 104 bottles in total. So, yes, many more bottles can be found on the other side of the street than what Danny initially had.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old bottles and found 48 new ones in the park. So, he has 52 bottles in his collection now (including the ones he found in the park). Therefore, the number of bottles Danny gave away is 54 - 48 = 6.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 82 papers and 29 bottles in the park. Then he found 42 bottles and 61 bracelets at his store. So, we can calculate how many bottles Danny had at first like this:  Bottles at first = Total bottles found - Bottles found at store = 29 - 42 = 13 Therefore, Danny had 13 bottles in the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny found 66 papers and 39 bottles in the park. Now he has 16 bottles and 68 bracelets in his collection. So, we can calculate how many paper clips Danny had at the beginning as follows: Number of paper clips = Total number of paper clips found - Number of paper clips collected = 66 - 16 = 50 Therefore, Danny had 50 paper clips at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 46 papers and 50 bottles in the park. Now he has 21 bottles and 52 bracelets at his sale. So we can calculate how many bottle caps Danny found in the park as follows:  Number of bottle caps = Total number of bottles found - Number of bottles owned by Danny = 50 - 21 = 29 Therefore, Danny found 29 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 paper clips and 5 bottles in the park. Now he has 31 bottles and 9 bracelets in his collection. To find out how many more bottles with sunlight than with plastic Danny found in the park, we need to subtract the number of plastic bottles from the total number of bottles found. So, the difference between 5 (plastic) and 31 (total) is 26. Therefore, there are 26 more bottles with sunlight than with plastic that Danny found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 58 bottle caps and 25 papers in one box in the park. Now he has 11 papers and 12 bottles in his collection. So, how many more bottles does Danny have than he had initially?  We can calculate this as follows:  Initially, Danny had 58 + 25 = 83 objects (bottle caps and papers).  Now he has 11 + 12 = 23 additional objects (bottles). Therefore, Danny has 83 - 23 = 60 more bottles than he had initially.
Response:  We know that Danny collected 15 bottle caps and 18 papers in the park. Now he has 67 papers and 35 bottles in his collection. So, how many more bottles does Danny have than papers?  To find this difference, we can subtract the number of papers from the number of bottles:  Number of bottles = 35 - (18 + 15) = 35 - 33 = 2  Therefore, Danny has 2 more bottles than papers.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Steven. So if Jake has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 11 persimmons. Since Jake has 17 persimmons in total, we can set up the equation: x = 17 - 11. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, Steven has 6 more persimmons than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has x peaches, then Jake has x - 7 peaches. Since Jill has 14 peaches, we can write an equation:
x + (x - 7) = 14
Combine like terms:
2x - 7 = 14
Add 7 to both sides:
2x = 21
Divide both sides by 2:
x = 10
So, Jake has 10 peaches."
Response:  We know that Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has 13 peaches, then Jake has 13 - 18 = 5 peaches.  And we also know that Steven has 19 pears, so Jill must have 19 + 5 = 24 peaches.
Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven and 8 more pears than Jill. So if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 3 = 2x pears. And if Jill has y pears, then Jake has 2y pears. Now we are given that Steven has 5 pears. Therefore, Jake has 2(5) = 10 pears more than Jill. So Jake has 10 + y = 12 pears more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has 11 peaches, then Jake has 11 - 12 = 9 peaches.  We also know that Steven has four apricots, but this information is not relevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, we can conclude that Jill has more peaches than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and fewer pears than Jill. So, if we add up all of their numbers, we will get Jake's total number of pears. Here is how it works out:
Jake has 7 fewer pears than Steven, so he has 23 - 7 = 16 pears.
Jake also has 9 fewer pears than Jill, so he has 16 + 9 = 25 pears.
Therefore, Jake has 25 pears."
Response:  We know that Jake has 7 fewer pears than Steven and 8 more pears than Jill. So if Steven has 17 pears, then Jake has 10 (17 - 7) pears. Now we know that Jill has 9 pears (10 - 1). Therefore, Jill has 9 pears.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 9 fewer apples than Steven and 18 more apples than Jill. So if we add up all their numbers of apples, we get:
Steven = 16 + 9 = 25
Jake = 25 - 9 = 16
Jill = 0 (since she doesn't have any apples)
So, Steven has many more apples than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more fermented years than Jill. This means that if Jill has x persimmons, then Steven has x + 18 persimmons. Since Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven, we can conclude that Jake has less than x persimmons. Therefore, the number of persimmons Jake has is less than x.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 5 pears.  We also know that Steven has 18 more fermented eggs than Jill. So if Jill has y fermented eggs, then Steven has y + 18 fermented eggs.  Now we are given that Jill has 87 fermented eggs. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 5) = y + 18. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 5 = y + 18. Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = y - 13. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us: x = (y - 13)/2.  Since Jill has 87 fermented eggs, we can plug in y = 87 into the equation to find out how many fermented eggs Jake has: x = (87 - 13)/2 = 74. So Jake has 74 fermented eggs.
Response:  We know that Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven. So if Steven has x peaches, Jake has x - 16 peaches.  We also know that Steven has 15 pears than Jill. So if Jill has y pears, Steven has y + 15 pears. Finally, we are told that Jill has 12 pears. Therefore, the total number of pears is: x + (y + 15) = 12. Solving for y, we get: y = 30. So many pears have Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven and 79 fresh apples compared to Steven's 19 fresh apples. So, if we subtract 12 from 79, we get 67. Therefore, Jake has 67 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 fewer apples than Steven and 3 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has 9 apples, then Jake has 9 + 3 = 12 apples. Therefore, Jake has 12 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 apples less than Steven. So, if Jake has x apples, then Steven has x + 6 apples. Since Steven has more apples than Jake, we can say that x < x + 6. Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, Steven has 10 more apples than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we write it down like this:
Jake has 3(less) + 10(more) = X apples
We can simplify this equation as follows:
X = 7 (apples)
So, Steven has many more apples than Jake."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 pears and Jake has 4 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 4 = 8 pears. Now we are told that Jill has 67 pears more than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 8 pears and Jill has 67 + 8 = 75 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 peaches and Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which means Jake has 6 peches (18 - 12 = 6). Now we are asked how many fresh peaches Jill has. Since Jake has 6 peaches, and he gives 3 to his friend Tom, then Jill must have 3 + 6 = 9 fresh peaches. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 pears and Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven. So, Jake has 19 - 12 = 7 pears less than Steven. Now we are told that Jill has 72 more pears than Jake. Therefore, Jake has 72 - 7 = 65 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 pears and Jake has fewer than 14 pears but more than 6 pears. So, there are at least 8 pears that Jake has. Now we know that Jill has fewer pears than Jake, so she must have 3 or less pears. Therefore, the number of fresh pears that Jill has is 3.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 apples and 10 fewer than Steven. So, if Steven has x apples, then Jake has 84 - 10 = 74 apples. Since Steven also has 13 fresh pears, we can add this to his total number of fruit. Therefore, Jake has 74 + 13 = 87 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 13 apples and 17 pears. If we subtract the number of pears Steve has (8), then Jake must have __________ more apples than Steve has pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 8 fresh apples and 10 fresh pears than Steven. So, we can write this as an equation: 8 + 10 = x where x is the number of fresh pears that Steven has. Now, we are told that Steven has 11 apples and 18 fresh pears. So, we can substitute these values into our equation: 8 + 10 = 11 + 18. Solving for x, we get: x = 26. Therefore, Steven has 26 fresh pears more than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer apples than Steven and 4 more pears than Steven. So, if we write this down as an equation:
Apples = 3 - x (where x is the number of apples Steven has)
Pears = 4 + x (where x is the number of pears Steven has)
We can substitute the values given in the question into these equations:
Apples = 3 - 19 = -16
Pears = 4 + 15 = 19
So, Steven has many more pears than Jake, but Jake has more apples than Steven."
Response:  If there were $78 in the pockets and $15 was spent on actions, then... (calculate)...there would be $63 left ($78 - $15 = $63). So, yes, many money does have!
Response:  If Olivia has $33 left after buying $78 worth of things at the mall, then she must have spent $45 ($78 - $33) on things at the mall. Therefore, many people had Olivia when she went to the mall.
Response:  If there were $100 in her pockets and she took out $148 from an ATM, then there would be $24 left ($100 - $148 = $24). After buying something worth $159 at a supermarket, there would be nothing left ($24 - $159 = $-$135). So, the correct answer is $-$135.
"Response:  The person had $3 in their pockets and took out $49 from a mini-bank. After that, they went to a supermarket where they spent $49. So, did they make money or lose money? To find this out, we need to subtract the amount they spent ($49) from the amount they had in their pocket ($3). Therefore, the final result is:  $3 - $49 = -$46. Since there are no negative numbers in Norwegian, the correct answer would be ""Nei"" (No), meaning that the person lost money."
Response:  Firstly, there were $53 in her pockets. Then she took out $91 from an ATM. After that, she spent $14 at a supermarket. So, how much money did she have left after buying things at the store?  Therefore, the correct answer is:  $91 - $14 = $77
Response:  We know that Henny had $106 in her purse before she went to the market. After she spent $26 at the market, she was left with $70. Then, she spent $49 at the shopping center. So, if Ho used $49 at the shopping center, how much did Henny spend there?  Solution: $70 - $49 = $21. Therefore, Henny spent $21 at the shopping center.
Response:  If there were $29 in the cash register and $54 in the pocket, then the total amount of money that the person had was $83 ($29 + $54). So, the person used approximately $83 / $2 = $41.50 (round to nearest cent)
"Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the mall and there were originally $128 in her wallet, then we can calculate how many people had money in their wallets as follows:

$128 - $38 = $90

So, there were $90 in wallets other than Olivia's."
Response:  If Dave had 19 applications on his phone and he deleted 5 of them, then he has 14 remaining apps on his phone. So, the correct answer is 14.
Response:  If Dave had 18 applications and then deleted 13 of them, he would have 5 remaining apps. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  At first, Dave had 3 applications on his phone (he had 3 apps). Then he added 11 new applications to his phone (he added 11 more apps), so now he has 14 applications in total (11 + 3 = 14). After deleting some of them, he was left with 4 applications (he deleted some apps). So, Dave has deleted 10 applications (14 - 4 = 10).
"Response: 
Dave started with 21 apps on his phone and then added 89 new applications. After deleting some of them, he was left with 24 apps. So, in total, Dave has added 67 (89 - 21) new apps to his phone."
"Response: 
Dave initially had 15 applications on his phone. Then he added 71 new applications, so he now has a total of 86 applications (15 + 71 = 86). After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 applications. So, he deleted 73 applications (86 - 14 = 73)."
Response:  We know that Dave started with 16 applications and 77 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 11 applications (16 - 5 = 11) and 54 files (77 - 23 = 54).
Response:  We know that Dave started with 17 applications and 21 files on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 3 applications and 7 files. So, we can say that he deleted 14 applications (17 - 3 = 14) and 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some applications and files, he had 21 applications and 4 files left. So, Dave has more than 10 applications (he had 15 initially) but less than 20 (he had 21 after deleting some). Therefore, the correct answer is: More than 10 but less than 20.
Response:  We know that Dave started with 19 applications and 18 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, so he ended up with 6 applications and 15 files. To find out how many more files he has now than he did at first, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting things from the total number of files he had initially: 15 - 18 = -3. So, Dave has 3 fewer files on his phone now than he did to begin with.
Response:  If Dave had 17 applications on his phone before adding more, then he added 1 application after having 17 apps. So, the total number of applications he has now is 18 (the original 17 + 1 new one). Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  If Dave started with 59 applications and 15 programs on his phone, that means he had a total of 74 items (applications + programs) initially. Then, after deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. So, in total, Dave deleted 62 items (59 - 12 = 47 applications and 15 - 30 = 20 programs).
Response:  We know that Dave started with 24 files and 13 applications on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 17 apps and 21 files left. So, we can say that Dave deleted 7 files (24 - 21 = 7) and 6 apps (13 - 17 = 6).
"Response:  At first, Dave had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. Then he deleted some applications and files, leaving him with 5 applications and 12 applications. So, in total, Dave has more than 5 applications left after deleting some of them.  Therefore, the correct answer is ""Yes""."
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. Then he deleted some apps and files, leaving him with 24 files and 2 applications. So, in total, Dave has 26 items (files + applications) on his phone.
Response:  We know that Nell collected cards at the baseball center and had 242 cards in total. She gave 136 of her cards to Jeff. So, how many cards did Nell have initially?  Therefore, Nell had 242 - 136 = 106 cards initially.
Response:  We know that Nell has collected 301 of the 50 cards and gave 154 to Jeff. So, we can calculate the number of cards Nell had in the starting position as follows: Number of cards Nell had = Total number of cards - Number of cards given to Jeff = 50 - 154 = -104 Therefore, Nell had -104 cards in the starting position.
Response:  If Nell has 528 cards and gives some to Jeff, then she will have fewer than that number of cards left after giving them away. So, let x be the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff. Then we know that x + 252 = 528 (since Nell has 252 cards left). Solving for x, we get x = 306. Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 306 cards.
Response:  We know that Ho has 566 cards and gave some to Jeff. So, Ho now has 535 dollars in reserve and 535 - 234 = 301 cards left with him. Therefore, Jeff has 301 cards.
"Response:  We know that:
Nell has 309 baseball cards and 356 tens.
She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 tens.
To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than tens, we can subtract the number of tens from the total number of baseball cards:
415 - 149 = 266
So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than tens."
Response:  We know that Nell has 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-year-olds. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now she has 404 of the same cards and 495 of the other ones. So, how many more baseball cards does Nell have than Jeff?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of cards Jeff has from the total number of cards Nell has.  Therefore, the answer is:  Nell has 358 more baseball cards than Jeff.
Response:  We know that Nell collected cards at the baseball center and had 573 cards in total. She gave John 195 cards and then gave some to Jeff. So, after giving away some cards, Nell had 210 cards left. Therefore, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is 210 - 195 = 15.
Response:  We know that Nell has 438 balls in total. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and got 5 to 10 of the other cards and 178 for baseball. How many more baseball cards does Nell have than 10?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from the total number of cards she has. So, if she gave him 5 to 10 cards, that means she gave him 5 + 10 = 15 cards. And if she has 178 cards for baseball, then she must have 438 - 178 = 260 cards left. Therefore, Nell has more than 10 baseball cards.
"Response:  We know that:
Nell has 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-year cards.
She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff and now she has 376 - 10 = 366 baseball cards and 111 ten-year cards left.
So, the difference between the number of baseball cards Nell has and the number of ten-year cards she has is:
366 - 111 = 255
Therefore, Nell has 255 more baseball cards than ten-year cards."
Response:  If Paco has eaten 19 small kebabs and has 35 left, then he must have started with a total of 54 small kebabs (19 + 35).
Response:  If Paco had 28 small kettles and ate some of them, then he has fewer small kettles left. So, if he ate 7 small kettles, he now has 21 small kettles left. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  Paco started with 40 small kettles and ate two of them. So he has 40 - 2 = 38 left. Then he bought 37 more small kettles, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 total small kettles. Therefore, Paco has 75 small kettles left.
Response:  Paco had $25 and spent $5 of it. So he has $25 - $5 = $20 left. Then, he bought 3 small kiosks with $20. So, in total, Paco spent $20 + $20 = $40. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 (the number of times he spent money).
Response:  Paco started with 13 small kettles (sm√∏rkj√∏kker in Norwegian). He ate two of them, so he had 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 more small kettles, so now he has 11 + 36 = 47 small kettles in total. Therefore, the number of kettles Paco purchased is equal to the number of kettles he already had plus the number he bought, which is 47.
Response:  If Paco has 40 small kettles and eats 5 of them, then he has 40 - 5 = 35 left.  Then, if he gives 13 to his friend, he has 35 - 13 = 22 left. So, Paco has 22 small kettles left.
Response:  Paco has 17 small kitchens (sm√•kj√∏kkar). He eats 14 of them and gives 13 away to his friend. So he has 17 - 14 = 3 left for himself. Now we need to compare how many more cookies Paco took than his friend. The difference between their amounts is 3 - 13 = -10. Therefore, Paco took fewer cookies than his friend.
Response:  Paco had 12 small cookies (sm√∏rbr√∏d). He ate 16 cups of coffee and gave 21 of them to his friend. How many more biscuits did he give his friend than he ate himself?  We know that Paco ate 16 cups of coffee, which is equal to 16 x 0.5 = 8 biscuits. So, he gave his friend 21 - 8 = 13 more biscuits than he ate himself.
Response:  We know that Paco has 22 sweet cookies and 75 salted cookies in total. He eats 15 sweet cookies and 54 salted cookies. So, if we subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he has, we get: Total number of cookies Paco has = 22 + 75 - (15 + 54) = 22 + 75 - 69 = 36 Cookies. Therefore, Paco has 36 sm√∏rbr√∏d.
Response:  If Paco has 9 sweet and 6 salt balls, he has in total 15 balls (9 + 6 = 15).  If he eats 36 sweet cookies, he will have 36 - 15 = 21 left. And if he also eats 3 salt cookies, he will have 0 salt cookies left because he already ate 3. So, the number of salt small cookies that Paco ate is 3.
"Response:  If Paco had 37 sweet and 11 salted small cookies, he had in total 48 cookies (37 x 2 = 74 + 11).   
If he ate five sweet and two salted small cookies, then he ate a total of 7 cookies (5 x 2 = 10 + 2). So, many sweet small cookies did Paco eat?  Answer: 7"
Response:  We know that Paco had 8 sweet and 6 salted balls. He ate 20 sweet and 34 salted cookies. How many salted kakers did he have in addition to the sweet ones? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salted balls he had. So, the answer is:  Number of salted kakers = Total number of salted balls - Number of sweet cookies eaten  In this case, the total number of salted balls is 6, and the number of sweet cookies eaten is 20. Subtracting these two numbers gives us the answer:  Number of salted kakers = 6 - 20 = -14 Therefore, Paco had -14 salted kakers in addition to the 8 sweet kakers he had.
Response:  If Paco has 36 small kitchens and he starts with 37 in preparation, then he must have had x more small kitchens initially. Since he started with 36, we can write an equation:  x + 36 = 37. Solving for x, we get: x = 11. So, Paco had 11 more small kitchens initially.
Response:  If Paco has 36 small kettles and gives away 14 of them, then he still has 22 small kettles left.  So, the answer is 22.
Response:  Paco gave away 9 small kettles and ate 18 small kettles. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 left. Now his friend took more than half of them (50%), which is equal to 32 / 2 = 16. Therefore, his friend took more cookies from Paco than Paco himself took from his friend.
Response:  Paco initially has 6 small kettles (sm√•kj√∏k). He gives his friend 30 of them, so now he has 30 - 6 = 24 left. Then, he eats 23 of them, leaving him with 1 (the remaining one). So, the number of biscuits he gave to his friend is 30, and the number he ate himself is 23, which means he gave more biscuits than he ate.
Response:  We know that Paco has 97 saltar and 34 sweet balls. He eats 15 sweet balls and 56 salty cookies. So, how many cookies does Paco have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of sweet balls he ate from the total number of cookies he had. Therefore, the answer is: Paco has 34 - 15 = 19 sweet cookies left.
Response:  Paco has 26 salted and 17 sweet balls. He eats 14 sweet and 9 salted small cookies. How many salted small cookies does Paco have left? We know that he ate 9 of them, so if we subtract 9 from 26, we get 17. So, Paco has 17 salted small cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco had 39 sweet and 6 salty balls in total. He ate 23 salty balls and 32 sweet balls. So, we can calculate how many more sweet balls he ate than salty balls as follows:  Sweet balls eaten - Salty balls eaten = 32 - 23 = 9  Therefore, Paco ate 9 more sweet bolls than salty balls.
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 40 sweet and 25 salted balls. He ate 28 salted and 15 sweet balls. So, he has fewer salted balls now than he started with (he ate some). Now we need to find out how many more sweet balls he has than he started with. To do this, we subtract the number of sweet balls he ate from the initial total number of sweet balls: 40 - 15 = 25. So, Paco has 25 more sweet balls than he started with in addition to the ones he already had.
Response:  If Gwen received $7 for her birthday and spent money in some way to get $5 on her feet, then she didn't spend all of the $7 on her feet. So, the answer is no, Gwen did not spend many dollars on her feet.
Response:  Gwen spent $8 and got back $6. So she has $2 more than she spent. Therefore, Gwen received $10 (answer).
Response:  Gwen received $4 from her mom and spent $3 of it. So she has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad. She spent $4 of it. So, how much money did Gwen get from her mom compared to her dad?  We can see that Gwen got $8 - $4 = $4 more dollars from her mom than she got from her dad. Therefore, the correct answer is $4.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mom and $6 from her dad. She spent $4 of it. So, how many dollars did Gwen get from her father more than she got from her mother?  We can solve this problem by subtracting the amount that Gwen spent ($4) from the total amount she received ($8 = $2 + $6). Therefore, Gwen got $8 from her father more than she got from her mother.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. She spent $4 of it. So, how much money did Gwen receive from her mother more than from her father?  To find out, we can subtract the amount Gwen spent ($4) from the total amount she received ($7): $$ \therefore 7 - 4 = 3 $$ Therefore, Gwen received $3 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $5 from her father for her birthday. She spent $2 on something and gave $1 to her mother. So she has $4 left ($5 - $2 + $1 = $4). Now we are asked if Gwen got more money from her father than she gave to her mother. Yes, Gwen got more money from her father ($4) than she gave to her mother ($1), so the answer is yes.
Response:  If Josh had 9 small balls in his collection and he took away 4 of them, then he must have had 9 - 4 = 5 small balls left. So, he did not lose any balls.
"Response:  If Josh has 21 big bells in a row and he lost 21 of them, then he must have had 42 small bells (since 21 + 21 = 42). So, if he doesn't have 12 small clangers, he must have had many more than that. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Many""."
Response:  If Josh had 19 small clots in his collection and he lost 11 of them, then he has 8 remaining clots (19 - 11 = 8).  If he found 5 new clots, then he now has a total of 13 clots (8 + 5 = 13). So, the number of clots Josh has is 13.
Response:  If Josh has 4 small balls in his collection and he loses 16 of them, then he has 4 - 16 = -12 balls left. Then, if he finds 8 new balls, he will have 8 + (-12) = 6 balls in total. So, he lost 12 balls and found 8 new ones, so the final number of balls he has is 6.
Response:  If Josh had 7 small balls in his collection and he lost 8 of them, then he has 7 - 8 = 9 remaining balls. Then, if he found 10 new balls, he will have 9 + 10 = 19 balls in total. So, the correct answer is 19.
Response:  If Josh has 21 small clots in his collection and he found 7 of them, then we can say that... (read more)
Response:  If Josh has 20 small balls in his collection and he gives one to Jack, then Josh has 19 small balls left.  Since Josh gave two small balls to Jack, Josh now has 17 small balls left. Therefore, the answer is 17.
"Response:  If Josh has 22 small clams in his collection and Jack gave him $20, then we can calculate how many nectars Josh now has as follows:

Nectars = Value of money given to Josh / Price of one nectar
= $20 / $1 (price of one nectar)
= 20 nectars

Therefore, Josh now has 20 nectars."
Response:  If Josh has 11 big toes and 19 small toes in total, then he must have 11 + 19 = 30 toes altogether.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh has 22 small coins in his collection. Then he found $13 in one dollar roll before losing $5 in another dollar roll. So, how many nectars does Josh have now?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of nectars = Total value of coins - Value of lost coins = 22 + 13 - 5 = 30 nectars Therefore, Josh has 30 nectars in total.
Response:  If Josh has 15 small clay balls in his collection and he finds 9 of them full, then he has 6 (15 - 9) remaining clay balls that are not full.  If he loses 23 of these remaining clay balls, then he will have 0 (6 - 23) clay balls left. So, many clay balls did Josh lose? Answer: 0
Response:  If Josh had 3 small balls in his collection and found 6 more, then he had a total of 9 balls (3 + 6 = 9). However, if he lost 5 of them, he would have 4 balls left (9 - 5 = 4). So, the answer is 4.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 4.6 kg of berries.  If we assume that each berry weighs approximately 0.1 grams (which is a rough estimate), then the total number of berries they picked can be calculated as follows:

Number of berries = Total weight of berries / Weight of one berry
= 4.6 kg / 0.1 grams/berry
= 4600 berries

Now, let's find out how much Marco's berries weighed. According to the question, Marco's berries weighed 45 kilograms. Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, we can convert this to number of berries as follows:

Number of berries = Total weight of berries / Weight of one berry
= 45 kg / 0.1 grams/berry
= 45000 berries

Finally, to calculate the number of gongs it took for them to pick the berries, we need to divide the total number of berries by the number of gongs used:

Number of gongs = Number of berries / Number of gongs per person
= 4600 berries / 2 people (assuming Marco and his father picked the berries together)
= 2300 gongs

Therefore, it took Marco and his father approximately 2300 gongs to pick the 4.6 kg of berries."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went out and picked berries together. They weighed two berries together to get one kilogram. Marco's berries weighed 45 kilograms. Is Marco's berry heavier than his father's berry?  To solve this problem, we need to divide the weight of Marco's berries by the weight of his father's berries. So, if Marco's berries weigh 45 kg, and his father's berries weigh x kg, then we can say that Marco's berries are y times heavier than his father's berries, where y is equal to 45 divided by x. In other words, if Marco's berries are twice as heavy as his father's berries, then x will be half of 45, or 22.5 kilograms. Therefore, Marco's berries are approximately 2.3 times heavier than his father's berries.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went out and picked berries together. They picked two berry bushes that weighed eight kilograms in total. If Marco's father's berries weigh 45 kilograms, how much did Marco pick? To find this out, we can divide the weight of Marco's father's berries by two, since they were both picking berries together. So, if Marco's father's berries weigh 45 kilograms, then Marco must have picked half of them, which is 22.5 kilograms (45 kg / 2 = 22.5 kg).
"Response:  Firstly, we have ""Marco"" who went out with his father and picked strawberries. Even though he has two small children, he is not sure if he can call it a joke. He only knows that he can be certain. How much weight do you think the strawberries are?"
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father collected a heap of strawberries that weighed around 10 kg. On their way back, they lost eight kilograms of lemons. Then, Marco's strawberries were reduced to 1.5 kg. So, did Marco lose weight? No, he didn't. The correct answer is zero (0).
Response:  If Marco and his father went out to pick berries and collected a heap of berries that weighed around 20 kg (44 lbs), then when Marco returned home, his father gave him 8 kg (17.6 lbs) of citrus fruits in his backpack. Since Marco's fruit didn't want to weigh 20 kg (44 lbs), how much did it weigh?  Solution:  To find out how much Marco's fruit weighed, we need to subtract the weight of the berries his father gave him from the total weight of the berries they collected. So, if the berries they collected weighed around 20 kg (44 lbs), and his father gave him 8 kg (17.6 lbs) of citrus fruits, then Marco's fruit must have weighed approximately 12 kg (26.4 lbs).
"Response:  Firstly, let's calculate how much jordb√¶ret Marco and his father collected together:

Marco and his father collected 20 kg of berries.

Then, they went back home and found some more berries that weighed around 5 kg (as stated in the question). So, the total weight of jordb√¶ret they gathered is:

20 kg + 5 kg = 25 kg

Now, let's find out how much jordb√¶ret Marco had:

Marco had 14 kg of jordb√¶ret.

So, the difference between the total weight of jordb√¶ret they gathered and the amount of jordb√¶ret Marco had is:

25 kg - 14 kg = 11 kg

Therefore, Marco's jordb√¶ret weighed approximately 11 kg."
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father went out to pick berries together.  Marco picked berries that weighed 7 kg (or 15.4 lbs).  Now, let's calculate how much water is needed for Marco to have picked all those berries.  To do this, we need to use the formula: Water weight = Berry weight / Picking efficiency Where ""picking efficiency"" is a measure of how much of each berry Marco actually picked, rather than just how many he found. For example, if Marco had an efficiency of 0.8, then he would have picked 80% of each berry he found, so he would have picked 6 kg (or 13.2 lbs) of berries overall. So, to calculate the amount of water used to grow these berries, we can multiply the total weight of berries picked by the water content of each berry. The average water content of a strawberry is around 90%, which means that every 100 grams of strawberries contains about 90 grams of water. Therefore, if Marco picked 6 kg of berries, then he used approximately 5.4 liters of water to grow them (6 x 0.9 = 5.4).  As for the second part of the question, it seems to be asking about the volume of the beer and muffin that Marco drank or ate. However, without more information, it's impossible to determine exactly how much water was used in producing these items. Perhaps they were made from locally sourced ingredients with low water requirements, or maybe they were imported from somewhere else where more water was used in their production. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a meaningful answer to this part of the question."
"Response:  If Marco and his father went out to pick berries and Marco picked 30 kg of them, then... (1)...Marco picked 30 kg of berries (2)...the weight of the berries is 30 kg (3)...the number of times Marco said ""Oh"" was 4 (based on the information provided). Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  We know that Marco weighed 4 kg and his father weighed more than him. Therefore, if we divide the weight of the fruits (jordb√¶rene) by the weight of Marco, we will get an estimate of how much heavier his father is compared to Marco. So, 4 kg / 4 kg = 1.  Therefore, Marco's father is approximately 1 times heavier than Marco.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went out to pick strawberries together. They picked 45 kg of strawberries from their garden. And we also know that they used some of those strawberries to make jam. Specifically, they made 10 kg of jam with the strawberries they picked. So, how much weight did Marco have left after making the jam? Well, he had 35 kg of strawberries left over (45 - 10 = 35). Now, let's say that one pound is roughly equal to 0.45 kg (which is a rough conversion, but it will do for our purposes here). So, if Marco had 35 kg of strawberries left over, that means he had approximately 82 pounds (35 x 0.45 = 82) of strawberries left after making the jam.
Response:  We know that there were 10 children on the bus and they were either deaf or not deaf. So, we can say that there are 5 deaf children (3 + 2) and 5 non-deaf children (4 + 1). Since there are more than one non-deaf child, it means that there is at least one non-deaf child for every two deaf children. Therefore, the answer is greater than 1.
Response:  We know that there are 26 born who were on the bus and got off at some point. Then, we have 10 more born who came to the bus stop. So, in total, there are 36 born (26 + 10) who are related to this bus.
"Response:  We know that there were some children who were on the bus and when they arrived at the station, two more children got off the bus. So, in total, there were 41 children on the bus. Now we need to find out how many children were on the bus before they came to the station. To do this, we can use the information given in the question: ""Det var nokre born som var p√• bussen."" This means that some children were already on the bus when it left. Therefore, the number of children who were on the bus before coming to the station is equal to the number of children who were already on the bus minus the number of children who got off at the station. Using the information provided, we can calculate the answer as follows: Number of children who were on the bus before coming to the station = 41 - 2 = 39. So, the correct answer is 39."
Response:  Firstly, there were 43 people on the bus. Then some of them got off the bus and went outside. After that, 21 more people boarded the bus. So, in total, how many people saw the bus?  Therefore, the answer is 64 (43 + 21).
Response:  We know that there were 41 children on the bus who were from India and not feeling well. They were not allowed to travel. After some of them got off the bus, there were 18 children left inside. These children formed part of a group. How many more children were on the bus in the city to stop?  Therefore, the answer is 23 (18 + 5).
"Response:  We know that there were 21 children who were born in South Africa and were 12 years old when they came to the bus stop. When they arrived at the bus stop, 10 buses left from the bus and some more arrived. Therefore, there were 16 children in the bus. Now we need to find out how many of them said yes to getting on the bus at the bus stop. To do this, we can use the information that ""dei var ein del av ei gruppe"" which means ""they were part of a group"". This implies that all members of the group agreed to get on the bus together. So, the answer is Yes, all 16 children said yes to getting on the bus at the bus stop."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were five blind people on the bus (line 2). Then, we are told that all of them got off the bus at the stop (line 5), so their number is reduced to zero. Next, we learn that there were 63 children who boarded the bus and got off at the stop (lines 7-8). Finally, we see that there were 14 children from India who were not completely healthy (line 9). Therefore, the correct answer is 63.
Response:  We know that 36 children were born and got off the bus at some point. Then we are told that 12 of them came from New York. So, the number of children who did not get off the bus is:  $ \text {36 - 12 = } $ 24. Therefore, there were 24 children who did not get off the bus.
Response:  We know that there were 22 children on the bus who were from India and not feeling well. Out of these, 40 got off the bus at the stop. So, we have 22 + 40 = 62 children in total. Now, two of them were accompanied by adults, so we subtract 2 = 60 children who took the bus with them. Therefore, many children saw the bus (60).
Response: 1) At first, there were 28 born people on the bus. (Line 1) 2) Some of them got off and some got on the bus. (Line 2) 3) After that, there were 82 born people on the bus. (Line 4) 4) While they were waiting at the bus stop, 30 born people got off the bus. (Line 5) Therefore, the number of born people who were seen getting on or off the bus is 82 - 30 = 52.
Response:  We know that there were 23 children who got off the bus and 8 of them came from New York. So, if many children did not get off the bus, how many would it be compared to those who got on the bus?  Therefore, we can conclude that 15 children (23 - 8) did not get off the bus.
Response:  We know that there are 100 balls in total (bakaren laga). Now we need to find out how many balls each basket contains. There are 4 baskets in total (Kor mange flere kollar). So, let's divide the total number of balls by the number of baskets: 100 / 4 = 25. Therefore, each basket contains 25 balls.
Response:  If he has sold 54 balls and still has 13 left, then he must have started with 67 balls (54 + 13 = 67). So, if he sells all his remaining 13 balls, he will sell a total of 13 x 2 = 26 balls.
Response:  We know that Bakken has sold 145 cakes and has 72 left. So he has a total of 217 cakes (145 + 72). Now we want to find out how many cakes he has after selling x cakes. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:  Number of cakes = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes sold  In this case, the total number of cakes is 217, and the number of cakes sold is x. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:  Number of cakes = 217 - x  To find out how many cakes Bakken has after selling x cakes, we need to solve for x in the above equation.  Solution:  To solve for x, we can subtract 217 from both sides of the equation:  Number of cakes = 217 - x  Subtracting 217 from both sides gives us:  Number of cakes = -x  Since we are looking for the number of cakes Bakken has after selling x cakes, we can set x equal to -145, which means that Bakken has 72 cakes left after selling 145 cakes. Therefore, the answer is 72.
Response:  We know that Bakken has 155 kakes in total and Venner bought 140 small cakes from him. So, we need to find out how many small cakes Bakken had initially.  We can do this by dividing the number of small cakes Venner bought (140) by the total number of kakes Bakken had (155). Therefore, Bakken had 92 small cakes initially.
Response:  The baker has sold 105 cakes and bought 170 new pens. So, the total number of cakes the baker has had is: 105 + 170 = 275. Therefore, the baker has had 275 cakes in total.
Response:  We know that Baker sold 13 kakes and bought 91 new ones. So he sold 91 - 13 = 78 fewer kakes than he bought. Therefore, the number of kakes Baker bought is 78 more than the number of kakes he sold.
Response:  We know that Bakken sold 78 balls and bought 31 new ones. So, he had a total of 78 + 31 = 109 balls in his possession at one point. Now, we are asked how many more balls Baker sold than he bought. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of balls he bought from the total number of balls he had: 109 - 31 = 78. Therefore, Baker sold 78 more balls than he bought.
Response:  The baker had 110 cakes initially and sold 75 of them. Then he made 76 new cakes. So, in total, the baker has had __________ cakes.
Response:  The baker sold 71 of the 144 cookies he made (which is equal to 50%), and then he baked an additional 111 cookies. So, in total, the baker sold 71 + 111 = 182 cookies. Therefore, the number of more cookies the baker sold than he initially made is 182 - 144 = 38.
Response:  If he has 149 large cakes and 91 small cakes, in total he has 236 cakes (149 + 91).  If he sells 10 large cakes and 90 small cakes, then he will have 226 cakes left (236 - 10 - 90). So, he had 226 cakes after selling some of them.
Response:  If he has 7 large cakes and 148 small cakes, then if he sells 15 large cakes and 103 small cakes, how many small cakes does he have left?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of small cakes he sold = 15 + 103 = 118 Small cakes he still has = Total number of small cakes - Number of small cakes he sold = 148 - 118 = 30 So, he has 30 small cakes left after selling 15 large cakes and 103 small cakes.
Response:  We know that Bakken had 126 cookies and 48 cakes to bake. If he sold 115 cookies and 81 pastries, then he has fewer cookies than before. So, in total, Bakken made less than 126 cookies.  Therefore, the answer is (less than) 126 cookies.
Response:  If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, he would have made $168 in total ($70 x 2 = $140 + $88). So, if he had given the money to the baker, the baker would have received $168.
Response:  If he sold 158 cakes and 147 balls, then he would have 305 pieces (158 + 147). So if he sells more than that, he will have fewer pieces left. Therefore, the number of extra cakes he sold is equal to the difference between the total number of pieces he sold and 305. In other words, the number of extra cakes he sold is 305 - x, where x is the total number of pieces he sold. Since he sold 157 cakes and 169 balls initially, the number of extra cakes he sold is 305 - 157 = 158.
Response:  We know that the total number of cakes and small cakes sold is 54 + 143 = 197. If the baker sells 68 more large cakes and 92 more small cakes, then the new total number of cakes and small cakes sold will be:  Total number of cakes sold = 54 + (68 x 1) = 60 Large cakes sold  Small cakes sold = 143 + (92 x 1) = 135 In summary, after the baker sells 68 more large cakes and 92 more small cakes, there are 60 additional large cakes and 135 additional small cakes sold compared to the original amount.
Response:  Bakken sold $44 worth of bread in one day and lost $400. So he gained $356 from selling bread that day. If he had kept $48 instead of losing it all, how many dollars would he have had left after selling the bread?  To find out, we need to divide the amount he gained ($356) by the number of dollars he kept ($48). Therefore, if he had kept $48 instead of losing it all, he would have had $7 (i.e., $356 / $48 = $7).
Response:  If he started making 40 small cakes from the beginning, and he sold 8 of them, then we can calculate how many more cakes he could have sold if he hadn't stopped at 8. To do this, we need to subtract the number of cakes he already sold (8) from the total number of cakes he made (40). So, the answer is: 40 - 8 = 32. Therefore, he could have sold many more cakes than he actually did sell.
Response:  If he bought 137 small cakes from him and had made 169 small cakes at the beginning, how many small cakes would he have had in total at the end? So, the answer is 169 + 137 = 306 small cakes.
Response:  The baker had 173 cakes initially and sold 86 new ones. So, he has (173 - 86) = 87 remaining cakes. Therefore, the baker had 87 cakes in total.
Response:  The baker bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 new cakes. So he has 78 more cakes than he sold. Therefore, the number of cakes the baker bought is greater than the number of cakes he sold.
Response:  The baker bought 139 new cakes and sold 145 new cakes. So he has 6 more cakes than he sold. Therefore, the number of cakes the baker sold is equal to the number of cakes he bought minus the number of cakes he sold. In other words, the difference between the number of cakes he bought and the number of cakes he sold is equal to the number of cakes he sold.  Now we can write an equation based on this information:  Number of cakes sold = Number of cakes bought - Number of cakes sold  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of cakes sold = 139 - 145  Number of cakes sold = -6  Therefore, the baker sold 6 fewer cakes than he bought.
Response:  The baker has already made 62 cakes and then he makes 149 more. So in total, the baker has made 211 cakes (62 + 149). However, he sold only 144 of them. Therefore, the number of cakes that the baker had is 211 - 144 = 70.
Response:  We know that Baker made 92 cakes from the same dough as the Sami baker. He sold 46 of them. So, we can calculate how many more cakes Baker made than he sold:  Number of cakes Baker made - Number of cakes Baker sold = 92 - 46 = 46 more cakes. Therefore, Baker made 46 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  If he sold 108 cakes and 44 balls, then he would have 61 cakes left and 123 balls (since he started with 167). So, to find out how many cakes he had before selling any, we can subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had: 61 - 108 = -47. Therefore, he had -47 cakes before selling any.
Response:  We know that Bakken has 56 cakes and 124 candies in total. If he sells 104 cakes, then he will have 56 - 104 = 30 cakes left. Similarly, if he sells 29 boxes of chocolates, then he will have 124 - 29 = 95 candies left. So, to find out how many chocolate boxes he has after selling both cakes and candies, we can add the number of chocolate boxes he had initially (95) with the number of chocolate boxes he sold (29). Therefore, the final answer is: Bakken has 95 + 29 = 124 chocolate boxes after selling both cakes and candies.
Response:  If he sold 102 cakes and 94 sausages, then he would have 52 x 102 = 5360 kroner from selling cakes and 84 x 94 = 7936 kroner from selling sausages. In total, he would have 5360 + 7936 = 13296 kroner.
Response:  If he sold 140 cakes and 92 small cakes in one day, that means there are 232 cakes (140 + 92) in total. Now let's compare it to the number of cakes and small cakes he had before selling them: 134 large cakes and 11 towers = 145 cakes (134 + 11). So, yes, he has more cakes and small cakes after selling them.
Response:  We know that the total number of cakes sold is 14 large cakes and 153 small cakes. If he sells 8 small cakes, then the new total number of small cakes sold will be 97 + 8 = 105 small cakes. So, after selling 8 small cakes, there are more small cakes available for sale than before (105 - 97 = 8). Therefore, many small cakes can be sold at the bakery.
Response:  We know that the total number of small cakes sold is 154 + 78 = 232. So, if the baker sells many small cakes, he will sell more than 43 large cakes and 114 small cakes. Therefore, the correct answer is (Many)
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and wants to get 140 games back, we need to find out how many games she needs to buy.  We know that each game costs $60, so if Kelly buys x number of games, her total cost will be $60x.  To find out how many games Kelly needs to buy, we can set up an equation using this information:

$60x = 140 - 22

Solving for x, we get:

x = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 games to get 140 games in total."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games, and each game takes up an average of 500 MB of space, then we can calculate how much storage capacity Kelly needs to store all her games.  Therefore, the answer is 53 TB (Terabytes).
Response:  If Kelly gave away 91 of the same games to many people, and if each person got one hundred, then... (calculate)...Kelly would have 91 / 100 = 91 remaining games.
Response:  If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, that means she has a total of 90 games (20 + 70). To find out how many Nintendo games Kelly must sell to buy 12 more Nintendo games, we need to divide the number of Nintendo games she wants to buy by the number of Nintendo games she already has. So, if Kelly wants to buy 12 more Nintendo games, and she currently has 20 Nintendo games, then she needs to sell 8 (20 / 12) of her existing Nintendo games. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games Kelly needs to sell in order to have 31 of them, we need to divide the number of Sony games she wants by the number of Sony games she already has. So, we can calculate this as follows: Number of Sony games Kelly needs to sell = Wanted number of Sony games / Current number of Sony games = 31 / 132 = 0.23 Therefore, Kelly needs to sell approximately 23 Sony games in order to have 31 of them.
"Response:  Kelly has 80 Nintendo games and found 31 new ones that are compatible with Apple devices. To find out how many of these new games Kelly already had, we need to subtract the number of existing games she had from the total number of new games she found. So, the answer is:

New games Kelly didn't have = New games Kelly found - Existing games Kelly had = 31 - 80 = -59

Therefore, Kelly did not have any of the new games she found."
Response:  We know that Randy has a bottleneck (flaskehals) and he used 52 blocks to build a building. If there are 38 blocks left over, how many did he have initially?
"Response:  If Randy has 97 quarters and he used some stones to build a tower, then we know that he did not use all of his quarters for this purpose. So, if he used x quarters to build the tower, then he had (97 - x) quarters left over. We are asked how many quarters Randy used to build the tower. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x = (97 - x) / 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 35

So, Randy used 35 quarters to build the tower."
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks and he used 14 of them to build a castle and 11 of them to build a house. So, we can say that Randy has 54 blocks left (79 - 14 - 11 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 gates that Randy has built.
Response:  We know that Randy has 58 buildings in his town and he used 27 blocks to build one building. Therefore, he used 27 x 58 = 1564 blocks to build all the buildings in his town. Now we are asked how many blocks he used to build the tower and the house. We know that he used 53 blocks to build the house, so he used 53 - 27 = 26 blocks less than he used to build all the other buildings in his town. Therefore, Randy used 1564 - 26 = 1538 blocks to build the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 37 blocks to build his castle and 33 blocks to build the wall. So he has used more blocks to build the wall than the castle. Now we are asked how many more blocks he used to build the wall than he did the house. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used to build the house from the number of blocks he used to build the wall. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of blocks used to build the wall - Number of blocks used to build the house = 33 - 13 = 20 blocks.
Response:  We know that Randy has 86 blocks and he used 79 blocks to build a building. So, we can say that he had 8 - 79 = 17 blocks left over after building the building. Then, he used 82 blocks to build his house. So, now he has 17 + 82 = 99 blocks left. Therefore, Randy used 99 blocks to build his house.
Response:  If Randy has 36 blocks to build a tower and he wants to make many towers, then we can assume that each tower requires 36 blocks. So if he has 59 blocks in total, he will be able to build (59 / 36) = 10 towers.
"Response:  We know that Randy has 95 blocks and he used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So, we can write this as:

House = 20 blocks
Tower = 50 blocks

Now, let's compare how many blocks Randy used to build the tower versus the house:

Tower : House = 50 blocks : 20 blocks = 2.5 times more blocks were used to build the tower than the house.

So, Randy used 2.5 times more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house."
Response:  We know that Randy has 90 blocks left after building the house and tower.  The house requires 89 blocks to build, so he used all of them. Therefore, he had none left over. Similarly, the tower requires 63 blocks to build, but he already built it using some of his remaining blocks. So, he must have used at least 63 - 89 = 74 blocks to build the tower. Now we are left with the number of blocks Randy has left after building both the house and the tower. Since he has 90 blocks in total, and he used 89 blocks for the house and 74 blocks for the tower, he has 1 block left!
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have not read five of them, then you have read at least 15 books (20 - 5 = 15).
"Response:  If we have read 13 books in the series and there are 8 more to read, then the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

So, there are 21 books in the series called ""The Dark, Creepy School""."
Response:  If there are 22 books in the series and you have read 12 of them, then you have not read half of the books (22 / 12 = 1.8). Similarly, if there are 10 films in the series and you have seen 56 films, then you have not seen half of the films (10 / 56 = 0.17). Therefore, the correct answer is 1.8.
Response:  If there are 4 books and 17 films in the series, that means there are 4 x 17 = 68 different stories in total.  If you have read 19 books and seen 7 films, then you have not seen half of the stories (since 19 + 7 = 26). Therefore, the correct answer is 68 - 26 = 42.
"Response:  If there are 16 books and 14 movies in the series ""The Dark and Creepy School"", and you have read 19 books and seen 13 movies, then we can conclude that many of the books are ""fun"" at ""The Crazy School"". However, since we don't know how many books or movies are actually ""fun"", we cannot give an exact number. So, the answer is ""Many""."
"Response:  If there are 8 books and 10 films in the series ""The Crazy Stupid School"", then we know that you have read at least 8 books and seen at least 10 films.  However, if you have also read other books outside of this series, then it is possible that you have read more than 8 books. Similarly, if you have watched other films outside of this series, then it is possible that you have seen more than 10 films. Therefore, the correct answer is: Many films have you seen on ""The Crazy Stupid School""?"
"Response:  If there are ten different books and eleven different films in the series ""The Dark, Creepy School"", and you have read thirteen books and seen twelve films, then many books have you read?  We can use logical reasoning to find the answer.  Based on the information provided, we know that there are ten different books in the series, so if you have read thirteen books, then you must have read three additional books beyond what is listed in the series (since each book is unique). Similarly, since there are eleven different films in the series, and you have seen twelve films, then you must have missed seeing one of the films in the series. Therefore, the correct answer is three books have you read beyond those listed in the series."
Response:  If there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series, that means you have read 7 books and seen 21 movies. So, if you have seen more than half of the movies (which is 21 out of 17), then you have seen at least 10 movies. Therefore, the answer is 10.
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series ""The Sneaky, Clever School"" and you want to know how many more books there are, we can assume that each book represents one level of difficulty. Therefore, if you have read 8 books, it means you have reached Level 8. To reach Level 9, you would need to read another book, which brings us to a total of 9 levels or books in the series. So, to answer your question directly, you would need to read 10 more books (Levels 1-10) to complete the entire series."
Response:  If there are 62 films and 19 books in the series, that means you have read 4 books out of 62 (4/62 = 0.065). Therefore, you have watched 34 films out of 62 (34/62 = 0.557). So, you have read 4 books and watched 34 films.
"Response:  If we have read seven books and seen four movies from the series ""The Dark, Creepy School"", then we can conclude that we have experienced at least 7 + 4 = 11 different stories from the series. Therefore, if we have only read seven books and watched four movies, it means that we have not read or seen all of them, but rather many of them."
"Response:  If there are 14 movies and 15 books in the series ""The Dark and Creepy School"", and you have read 11 books and seen 40 movies, then we can conclude that many books are ""funny"" at ""The Crazy School"". However, without more information about what constitutes ""funny"" or how to measure it, we cannot give an exact number. Therefore, I will not provide a numerical answer to this question."
Response:  If there are 17 films in the series and you have seen 13 books, then you have not seen 4 films (17 - 13 = 4).  Similarly, if there are 11 books in the series and you have read 11 books, then you have not read any additional books (11 - 11 = 0). Therefore, the correct answer is 4.
Response:  If there are ten books and six movies in the series, that means we have a total of 60 different works to consider (ten times six).  If you have read 14 movies and 19 books, then you have not read half of the works in the series. Therefore, the number of books you have read is 19 - 14 = 5.
Response:  If you have seen 16 of the movies and read 19 of the books, that means you have not seen 3 movies and have not read 3 books. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  If he had 7 tickets and used them all to buy toys, then he has 0 tickets left. So, the answer is 0.
"Response:  If Dave spends $12 per day on toys and he has 14 tokens left, then we can calculate how many tokens he spent on toys in total as follows:

Total amount of money spent on toys = Number of days x Amount spent per day
= 14 x $12
= $168

So, Dave spent $168 on toys."
"Response:  If he spent five krone to buy toys and eleven krone to buy woolen clothing for many of them, then we can calculate how much money he had left over as follows:

Money spent on toys = 5 krone
Money spent on woolen clothing = 11 krone x number of people (many) = 11 krone x unknown amount
Total money spent = Money spent on toys + Money spent on woolen clothing
= 5 krone + 11 krone x unknown amount

Since we don't know the exact amount, let's assume it is between one and ten. We can use this range to estimate the total amount of money he had left over:

If the number of people was between 1 and 10:
Total money spent = 5 krone + 11 krone x 1 = 6 krone
Total money spent = 5 krone + 11 krone x 2 = 9 krone
...
Total money spent = 5 krone + 11 krone x 10 = 55 krone

As you can see, there are several possibilities, but based on the information given in the question, we cannot determine the exact amount of money he had left over."
Response:  If he spent $12 on toys and $7 on clothes, that means he has $19 left over after buying those things.  So if he bought many more toys and clothes, he would have even more money left over.
Response:  If he spent 8 dollars to buy toys and 8 dollars to buy clothes for many more people than he bought with his 8 dollars, then he would have spent less money buying clothes than toys. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  If he went from having $14 to having $2 in one season, that means he lost $12.  So if he spent $10 per day on toys, then he must have had $20 left after one season ($10 x number of days = $20).  Therefore, he had $20 / $2 = 10 toys.
Response:  If Haley had 14 trees in her backyard before the storm and after the storm there is a happy decline, then more than those who survived died in the storm. So, the answer is 14 - (number of survivors) = (number of dead).
Response:  If Haley has 13 trees in her garden and after one typhoon (tifunn) hits the city, there is a happy decline, then many of these trees may have survived the typhoon even though they died. So, the correct answer is 13 / 2 = 6.
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 trees in her garden before the storm. After the storm, four trees were left standing. So, we can say that 20 - 4 = 16 trees died during the storm. Therefore, many trees died in the storm.
Response:  We have three apples in Haley's garden (Haley has three apples in her garden). After one five-year-old child died in a super-silver sky (After one five-year-old child died in a super-silver sky), if we were to make twelve more trees from those remaining apple seeds, how many people would Haley have then?  So, the answer is 12.
Response:  If Haley had 9 trees in her garden and after one of them died, she pulled out 5 more, then how many trees does she have now? So, the answer is 9 + 5 = 14 trees.
Response:  If we assume that each tree has a diameter of 10 cm and is 15 meters tall (which is a reasonable estimate for a mature oak), then the volume of one tree can be calculated as follows: Volume = œÄ x (diameter/2)^2 x height = œÄ x (10/2)^2 x 15 = approximately 378 cubic meters. Now, if we have 12 trees with this volume, the total volume of all the trees would be: Total volume = 12 x 378 = approximately 4608 cubic meters. So, if all these trees were placed in a heap, their combined volume would be around 4608 cubic meters.
Response:  If there were initially 3 trees in the garden and after the storm 13 trees fell out of the garden, then we can calculate how many trees were not affected by the storm as follows: Number of untouched trees = Initial number of trees - Number of fallen trees = 3 - 13 = -10 So, 10 trees did not fall during the storm.
"Response:  If we assume that the trees in the forest were equally distributed among the 11 layers of soil, then we can calculate how many trees survived the storm based on their depth in the soil. Here is one possible calculation:

Let's say there are X trees in each layer of soil, and let's assume that the deepest layer (layer 11) contains half as many trees as the shallowest layer (layer 1). So if there are Y trees in total in all 11 layers, we can write:

X +... + X = Y

Now, let's assume that out of these Y trees, 3/4 survived the storm. This means that the number of trees that survived is:

Y / 4 = Z

So, the number of trees that survived the storm is Z."
Response:  If he could pick 66 apples per day and there are 28 apple trees in the orchard, then how many apples can he pick in total per day?  We need to multiply the number of apples he can pick per tree with the number of trees he has: 66 apples/day x 28 trees = 1764 apples/day
"Response:  If they harvested 8 kg of apples per day and needed 24 kg to make juice, how many days would it take them to gather that amount?

Answer:  To find out how many days it would take to collect 24 kg of apples, we need to divide the total amount by the daily harvest. So, 24 kg / 8 kg/day = 3 days. Therefore, it would take them 3 days to gather 24 kg of apples."
"Response:  If he went to the garden to see how many apples they had and he said: ""Wow! They found out that the harvest would last for 4 days. How many baskets of apples did they have per day?"" We can calculate this as follows:

Let X be the number of baskets of apples they had per day.
Since the harvest lasted for 4 days, we know that X x 4 = total number of baskets of apples they had during the harvest period.
We are given that the number of baskets of apples they had was a multiple of 3 (since he said ""so many sekker""). Therefore, we can write: X = 3k, where k is an integer.
Substituting this expression for X into the equation above, we get: 3k x 4 = total number of baskets of apples they had during the harvest period.
Simplifying, we get: 12k = total number of baskets of apples they had during the harvest period.
Therefore, the answer is 12k."
"Response:  If they have 38 seconds per day and each second contains 42 apple slices, then after 49 days they will have:

38 sec/day x 42 slices/sec = 1657 slices/day (approximately)

Now, to find out how many apples they will have after 49 days, we need to multiply the number of slices per day with the number of days:

1657 slices/day x 49 days = 83,093 apples (approximately)"
"Response:  If they had 66 seconds of daylight per day and each second contained 25 apple snacks, then after eight years of rationing, they would have had:

66 seconds/day x 8 years = 531.2 days

Now, let's calculate how many apple snacks they would have had during this time period:

531.2 days x 25 apple snacks/day = 13,275 apple snacks

Therefore, after eight years of rationing, they would have had approximately 13,275 apple snacks."
"Response:  If they collected 8 secers per day and each secir contains 35 apple cores, then we can calculate how many apple cores they had per day as follows:

Number of apple cores = Total number of secirs x Number of apple cores per secir
= 8 x 35
= 280 apple cores per day
Therefore, the answer is 280 apple cores per day."
Response:  If they collected 16 secers per day and each secir contains 57 appleins, it will take them 80 days to collect 80 secirs of apples. So, the answer is 80 days.
Response:  If he has 67 seconds per day and each second contains 12 apple slices, then he will have 804 apple slices per day (67 sec x 12 slice/sec). Now, if he has 35 seconds with an apple slice, then he will have 42 apple slices (35 sec x 12 slice/sec). So, to answer your question, he will have 42 apple slices if he has 35 seconds with one apple slice.
Response:  If they collected 74 seconds per day and threw away 71 of them, then after 51 days they would have collected a total of (74 x 51) = 3640 seconds. Now, if many seconds with apple will give us after 51 days, we can calculate it as follows: (3640 / 71) = 50 apples per day. Therefore, after 51 days, they would have 50 x 51 = 2550 apples.
Response:  If they collected 76 sacks per day and threw away 64 of them, then they had 12 sacks left (76 - 64 = 12). Now, if many apple trees can produce 50 apples per day, how many apples can one tree produce in a day? So, the answer is 12 x 50 = 600 apples per day.
"Response:  If they have 28 seconds of apple and 52 seconds of apple from the US each day, after 26 days they will have:

Apples from Norway = 28 x 26 = 704 seklar
Apples from the US = 52 x 26 = 1328 seklar
Total = 704 + 1328 = 2032 seklar
Therefore, after 26 days, they will have 2032 seklar (or 2 kg) of apples in total."
"Response:  If they could hack 82 kg of apples and 61 kg of oranges per day, in total they would have after 25 days:

Apples: 82 x 25 = 2050 kg
Oranges: 61 x 25 = 1525 kg
So, after 25 days, they would have 3575 kg (2050 + 1525) of fruit."
"Response:  If he has 31 seconds of apples left per day and they are not ripe enough to eat after 45 days, then we can calculate how many apples he will have in total.  We know that there are 86,400 seconds in a day (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour), so if he has 31 seconds of apples per day, he will have a total of:

31 seconds/day x 86,400 seconds/day = 2,639 apples/day

Now, let's calculate how many apples he will have after 45 days:

2,639 apples/day x 45 days = 122,775 apples

So, after 45 days, he will have 122,775 apples."
Response:  If he caught 44 seconds of apricots per day and 25 seconds of unripe apricots per day, then in total he caught 69 seconds of apricots per day (44 + 25). Now, to calculate how many bags of apricots he could have harvested per day, we need to divide the total amount of apricots he caught by the weight of one bag. Assuming each bag weighs 10 kg, then he could have harvested 69/10 = 6.9 bags of apricots per day.
"Response:  If they catch 5 kg of apples per day and there are 74 unripe apples, then we have:

Apples caught = 5 kg/day x 74 unripe apples = 370 kg/day (unripe)

Now, let's assume that out of these 370 kg/day, only 20% are ripe (which is a rough estimate). So, we have:

Ripe apples = 370 kg/day x 20% = 74 kg/day (ripe)

Therefore, the number of kilograms of apples that are not yet ripe is:

Not-yet-ripe apples = 370 kg/day - 74 kg/day = 306 kg/day (not yet ripe)"
"Response:  If they needed to have 54 seconds of apple-picking every day, and they wanted to know how many days it would take to pick all the apples, we can calculate as follows:

Days = Total time / Time per day
= 54 sekker / 18 sekker per day
= 3 days

So, it would take them 3 days to pick all the apples if they need to have 54 seconds of apple-picking every day."
"Response:  If they collected 56 sekars of apples in total and wanted to know how many sekars they gathered per day, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of sekars / Number of sekars collected per day
= 56 /? (where? is the number of sekars collected per day)

Solving for?, we get:

? = 56 / 30 (since they collected 30 sekars per day)
? = 1.83 sekars per day

Therefore, they gathered approximately 1.83 sekars of apples per day."
"Response:  If he had 25 kg of immature apples and 5 kg of mature apples per day, after 73 days he would have:

Immature apples: 25 x 73 = 1825 kg
Mature apples: 5 x 73 = 365 kg
Total apples: 1825 + 365 = 2190 kg

So, after 73 days, many poles with apples will they have? The answer is 2190 kg."
"Response:  If he could hack 65 seconds with an apple and 46 seconds with a mate apple per day, after six days he would have hacked a total of:

65 x 6 = 390 seconds with apples
46 x 6 = 276 seconds with mates
Total time = 390 + 276 = 666 seconds
Therefore, after six days, many pens with apples will have been written."
Response:  If he found out that they had 41 seconds of apple and 86 seconds of mate apple per day, then we can calculate how many apples or mates they have in total. To do this, we need to convert each second into minutes and hours. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so 41 seconds is equal to 0.7 minutes (41/60). Similarly, there are 60 minutes in one hour, so 86 seconds is equal to 1.39 hours (86/60). Now, let's add up the total time of both apples and mates: 0.7 + 1.39 = 2.09 hours. Therefore, they have approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes of apples and mates combined per day.
Response:  If he found out that they had 71 seconds of apple and 60 seconds of mate apple per day, then we can calculate how many minutes they have in total.  There are 60 seconds in one minute, so if we multiply 71 seconds by 60, we get 4360 seconds.  Therefore, they have 4360 seconds of apple per day.
Response:  The length of the room is given as 4 meters and its width is given as 3 meters. To find out how much area the room has, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = Length x Width. So, in this case, the area of the room is: Area = 4 x 3 = 12 square meters. Therefore, the room is 12 square meters in area.
Response:  The length of Hans is 2 meters (m). To find out how wide he is, we need to divide his length by his height. His height is half his length, so if HANS is 2 m long, then his height is also 2 m / 2 = 1 m. Therefore, the width of Hans is 1 m.
Response:  We know that Hans is 2 meters wide and we want to find out how long he is. So, let's divide his width by 2.  Therefore, the length of Hans is 2 x 0.5 = 1 meter.
Response:  The length of the room is 4 meters and its width is 5 meters. To find out how many square meters there are in the room, we multiply the length and width:  Room area = Length x Width = 4 x 5 = 20 square meters. Since the floor has 4 square meters of space, we can divide the total room area by the floor area to find out how many rooms there are: Number of rooms = Total area / Floor area = 20 / 4 = 5 rooms. Therefore, there are 5 rooms in the house.
Response:  The room is 2 meters long and 12 meters wide, so its area is: Area = length x width = 2 x 12 = 24 square meters. Since there are 10 cubic meters of concrete in the room, we need to divide the area of the room by 10 to find out how many floors we need: Number of floors = area / volume = 24 / 10 = 2.4 floors. So you will need approximately 2.4 floors worth of concrete to fill the entire floor.
Response:  Since the room is 7 meters long and 7 meters wide, it has an area of 49 square meters (length x width). If there are 20 rooms in total, then the total area of all the rooms is 20 times 49 = 980 square meters. So, to cover the entire floor with rugs, Jessi will need approximately 980 teppes.
Response:  The length of the room is given as 6 meters and its width is also 6 meters. So, we can say that the area of the room = length x width = 6 x 6 = 36 square meters. Therefore, the height of the room is half of the area, i.e., 36 / 2 = 18 meters.
Response:  If Jessi has a square rug with a side length of x meters, then the area of the rug is x^2 meters squared. Since she wants to cover the entire room, we can set up the equation: Area of rug = Area of room. We know that the area of the room is given as 1 square meter, so we can substitute this value into our equation: x^2 = 1. Solving for x, we get: x = sqrt(1) = 1 meter. Therefore, the width of the room is 1 meter.
Response:  If Jessi has a square rug with an area of 1 square meter, then she needs $ \frac{1}{2} $ meters squared to cover the entire room. Therefore, the cost of the rug is $\$ \frac{1}{2} $. Now, let's assume that each meter of the rug costs $\$ 0.5$. Then, the total cost of the rug is $\$ \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 = \$ 0.25$. So, the answer is $\$ 0.25$.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much space is available for laying the carpet. According to the question, Jesse has 18 square meters of carpet. Now, let's calculate the length and width of the room where he wants to place the carpet. The question states that the room is either long or another meter long, which means it can be any value between 0 and 20 meters in length. Similarly, the width of the room can also vary between 0 and 20 meters. Therefore, the total area of the room is: Area = Length x Width = (Length + 1) x Width = 20 x Width Since Jesse has 18 square meters of carpet, we need to divide the total area of the room by the area of the carpet to determine how much more space there is to cover: Number of additional squares needed = Total area of room / Area of carpet = 20 x Width / 18 = Width / 3 = X Where X is the width of the room in meters. So, if the room is 4 meters wide, then Jesse needs 6 additional squares of carpet (X = 4). If the room is 5 meters wide, then Jesse needs 9 additional squares of carpet (X = 5). And so on...
Response:  The cost of each Razorback t-shirt is $23 per quarter. Since they sold 230 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they earned $529 in total ($23 x 230 = $529). Therefore, many T-shirts were sold.
Response:  We know that there are three shirts from Razorback and three shirts from Arkansas and Texas Tech. Each of these shirts costs $10. So, in total, they cost $30.
Response:  If they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and each shirt costs $20, then they made $940 in revenue ($47 x $20). However, if they sold 95 shirts in total, including both games, then their total revenue would be $1900 ($95 x $20). So, they made an additional $940 in revenue from the second game.
Response:  If they sold $10 each and made $10 x 242 = $2,420 in total revenue from both games, then if they sold 115 shirts during the Arkansas game, they would have made $10 x 115 = $1,150 from that game alone. So, they made an additional $1,270 ($2,420 - $1,150) from the Texas game. Therefore, they sold approximately 138 more shirts during the Texas game than they did during the Arkansas game (i.e., $1,270 / $10 per shirt).
Response:  If they sold 163 T-shirts during the last game in Arkansas and Texas Tech, then they earned $98 x 163 = $15,740 from selling T-shirts.  If they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they earned $98 x 89 = $8,722 from selling T-shirts.  So, if they sold 89 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, they would have made around $8,722.
Response:  If they sold 186 shirts during one game in Arkansas and Texas Tech, then if they sold 172 shirts during the Arkansas game, they would have made $500,000 that day. So, if they sold 172 shirts during the Texas game, they would have made $495,000 ($500,000 - $5,000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Butiken sold $26 per T-shirt and $99 per shirt.  In total, they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 shirts from Texas Tech. To calculate how much money they made selling these shirts, we can multiply the number of shirts sold by their respective prices:  For T-shirts: 183 x $26 = $4,708  For shirts: 31 x $99 = $3,099 Total amount of money made by Razorback Butiken: $4,708 + $3,099 = $7,807 Therefore, Razorback Butiken made a total of $7,807 selling those shirts.
Response:  The price of the quarter T-shirt is $67 and that of the quarter J-shirt is $165. If they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 J-shirts during the game, then their total revenue from shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of J-shirts x Price of J-shirt In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 = $39,820 + $25,940 = $65,760 So, they made a total of $65,760 in revenue from selling shirts during the game.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that $192 is the price of one T-shirt and $34 is the price of one tank top.  Therefore, if they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 tank tops during the game in Arkansas, then the total revenue from T-shirts would be:

$192 x 157 = $30,680

Similarly, the total revenue from tank tops would be:

$34 x 19 = $656

Now, let's compare the prices of T-shirts and tank tops. We can see that the price of T-shirts ($192) is higher than the price of tank tops ($34). So, based on this information alone, it seems that a T-shirt costs more than a tank top. However, without additional information about the cost structure or profit margins of the company selling these items, we cannot draw any definitive conclusions."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that one T-shirt costs $86 and one shirt costs $232. Now, let's assume that they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 shirts from Arkansas and Texas Tech during the game. To calculate how much money they made from these sales, we can multiply the number of items sold by their respective prices:
T-shirts: (254 x $86) = $21,976
Shirts: (43 x $232) = $9,606
Now, to find out which is more expensive, we need to compare the total amount of money made from selling T-shirts with the total amount of money made from selling shirts:
$21,976 > $9,606
Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, it appears that one T-shirt is more expensive than one shirt."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $51 is the price of each silver t-shirt. Since there are 130 shirts in total, the total revenue from selling all the shirts would be:  $51 x 130 = $6,430. So, the profit made by selling all the shirts would be: $6,430 - $51 = $6,379.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they sold $200 worth of silver jewelry in one store and made $14 from selling T-shirts at two different events in Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, their total earnings are $214. However, to calculate how much money they made per T-shirt, we need to divide the total earnings by the number of T-shirts they sold. Therefore, if they sold 14 T-shirts, their profit per T-shirt would be $214 / 14 = $15 per T-shirt.
"Response:  If Arkansas scored $3 in silver during the game against Texas Tech, and they spent $10 per quarter for T-shirts, then we can calculate how many T-shirts they bought as follows:

$3 / $10 = 0.3 (or 30%)

So, if Arkansas scored $3 in silver during the game, they bought approximately 30% of their total T-shirt budget."
Response:  We know that in one quarter of a year (3 months), they sold $215 worth of T-shirts. So, if we divide this amount by 4, we get: $215 / 4 = $53.75 per T-shirt. Therefore, each T-shirt costs approximately $53.75.
"Response:  The cost of one quarter T-shirt is $5 and that of another quarter T-shirt is $215. So, if they sold 20 shirts from Arkansas and 64 shirts from Texas Tech, then the total amount earned would be:

$5 x 20 = $100 (from Arkansas)
$215 x 64 = $13,700 (from Texas Tech)

Therefore, the total amount earned was $13,800."
Response:  The total number of shirts sold is given as 158 + 2 = 160.  Since each shirt costs $76, the total revenue from selling the shirts is 160 x $76 = $11,360.  Therefore, the profit made by selling the shirts is $11,360 - $204 = $11,156.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each shirt from both teams. According to the question, the cost of one quarter of the Arkansas shirts is $210 and the cost of one quarter of the Texas Tech shirts is $240. Therefore, the total cost of all the shirts from Arkansas is $525 ($210 x 2) and the total cost of all the shirts from Texas Tech is $576 ($240 x 2). Now, let's compare the costs of the two teams: The cost of all the shirts from Arkansas is $525, while the cost of all the shirts from Texas Tech is $576. So, yes, a T-shirt from Texas Tech is more expensive than a shirt from Arkansas.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many shirts were sold during the game in Arkansas. According to the question, they sold 113 shirts and 78 t-shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts sold is 191 (113 + 78). Now, let's calculate the cost of each shirt. The cost of a long-sleeved shirt was $ 115, and the cost of a t-shirt was $ 25. To find out how much one t-shirt costs, we can divide the cost of a t-shirt ($ 25) by the number of t-shirts sold (78). So, the cost of one t-shirt is approximately $ 0.32 (25 / 78). Now, let's compare the cost of a t-shirt with the cost of a uniform. A uniform costs $ 140, which means that one uniform costs approximately $ 0.86 (140 / 165). Based on this calculation, it seems that a t-shirt is cheaper than a uniform.
Response:  If they have five sets of tables and each set has ten chairs, then how many chairs do they have in total?  So, the answer is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are two tables with an equal number of chairs in the whole room. If we have 12 chairs in total, then each table must have at least 6 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6). So, if one table has 6 chairs and the other table also has 6 chairs, then they both have the same number of chairs. Therefore, the number of boards is also the same.  Thus, the answer is 2 boards.
Response:  If there are 9 chairs in total and 4 boards with 3 chairs each, then we have:  Total number of chairs = 9. Number of boards = 4. Number of chairs per board = 3. So, how many boards do they have? We can divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs per board to get the answer: Total number of boards = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per board = 9 / 3 = 3 boards. Therefore, they have 3 boards.
"Response:  If they have 11 pieces of board and each piece has 13 nails, then we can calculate how many nails they have in total as follows:

11 pieces x 13 nails per piece = 143 nails
So, if they have that many nails in their backyard, it means they have many nails there."
Response:  We have 10 tables and each table has 6 chairs. So, we have 10 x 6 = 60 chairs in total. If there are 11 people sitting at the tables, then it means that some of them will be sitting on multiple chairs. For example, if 3 people are sitting at one table, they will occupy 3 chairs out of the 6 available ones. Therefore, the number of occupied chairs is 60 - (3 x 3) = 45 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and 14 chairs. This means that each set has 1 table and 3 chairs (since 12 x 3 = 36). Therefore, the total number of tables is 12 / 3 = 4. So, there are 4 sets of tables. Now, we need to find out how many guests can fit in these 4 sets of tables. Since there are 6 extra chairs, this means that there are 6 more guests than the number of sets of tables. Therefore, the answer is 4 + 6 = 10 guests.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and chairs at the party venue. Each set has 3 chairs and 4 tables. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12, and the total number of tables is 4 x 4 = 16. Since 14 people are attending the party, we can calculate the average number of people per table as follows: Number of people / Total number of tables = 14 / 16 = 0.875. So, approximately 9 people will sit at each table.
Response:  If they have 14 chairs at the table and each chair has 9 different people sitting in it, then how many people are there in total? So, the answer is 14 x 9 = 126 people.
"Response:  If Viss Lewis makes $460 per day for five weeks, how much money will he make in total?

To calculate this, we can multiply the daily amount by the number of days he works:

$460 x 5 = $2300

So, Viss Lewis will make $2300 in total during those five weeks."
Response:  If Lewis has $1216 and spends $16 per week, how many weeks did it take him to spend that amount of money?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of weeks = Total amount / Weekly expenditure $ = 1216 / 16 $ = 75 weeks So, Lewis spent 75 weeks to spend $1216 at a rate of $16 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis pays $702 in taxes each year and he works 216 weeks per year, then his weekly income is:
$702 / 216 = $3.25 per hour
Now we need to calculate how much money Lewis makes per week working 40 hours per week:
$3.25 x 40 = $129 per week
So, Lewis makes $129 per week working 40 hours per week."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lewis would have earned in one year if he worked for 73 years. Using the formula: Total amount of money = Number of years x Average daily earnings, we get: Total amount of money = 73 years x $ 1,357 per week = $ 96,401 per year Now, let's assume that Lewis worked during each of those 73 years without taking any breaks or vacations. Therefore, his total earnings over those 73 years would be: Total earnings = Total amount of money x Number of years = $ 96,401 per year x 73 years = $ 6,857,303 Overall, based on these calculations, it is approximately 12% likely that Lewis would still be working as a carpenter in Utrecht after 223 days of work during the autumn season. As for how much money he might have saved up over those 73 years, assuming an average annual salary of $ 6,857,303 and no expenses or debts, Lewis could potentially have accumulated around $ 49,777,872 in savings.
Response:  If Lewis earns $28 per week during the last decade and also earns $939 per week working overtime, then his total income can be calculated as follows: Total income = Regular income + Overtime income = $28 x 50 weeks = $1400 + $939 x 10 weeks = $9390 So, if he works overtime for the remaining 4 weeks of the season, he will earn an additional $939 x 4 = $3736, bringing his total income for the season to $12,036 ($1400 + $9390 + $3736).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis has $403 per week and works for 233 weeks in a year. Therefore, his total income from work is:
$$ Total Income = 403 \times 233 = 93,190 $$
Now, he spends $49 per quarter on rent, which means he pays:
$$ Rent = 49 \times 4 = 196 $$
So, his total expenses are:
$$ Total Expenses = 93,190 - 196 = 92,994 $$
Therefore, Lewis makes a profit of:
$$ Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses = 92,994 - 92,994 = 0 $$
In other words, he doesn't make any money from his harvest."
"Response:  If Lewis has been spending $368 per week over the past decade, that means he has spent a total of:

$368/week x 52 weeks/year = $19,040/year

Now, if he needs to pay $388 per week to maintain his health status, he will need to save:

$388/week - $19,040/year = $17,652/year

Therefore, Lewis must save $17,652 per year to maintain his current health status."
Response:  If Lewis has $491 per week for the last decade, that means he has earned $491 x 10 = $4,910 in total over the past decade.  If he spent $216 per week during this time, then he must have saved $4,910 - $2,160 = $2,750.
Response:  Lewis has $133 per day for 19 weeks = $2505. So he will have $2505 - $133/day = $2372 left after 19 weeks.
Response:  If Lewis has been working for 50 weeks and he earns $10 per week, then his total income is:  Total income = Number of weeks x Weekly wage = 50 x $10 = $500 Now, if he saves $178 every week, then the number of weeks it took him to save that amount can be calculated as follows: Number of weeks = Total savings / Weekly wage = $178 / $10 = 17.8 weeks So, it took Lewis approximately 17.8 weeks to save $178.
Response:  If the water is ten times deeper than his height and he stands at nine feet tall, how far is the water? We can use the formula: distance = depth x height / 9 (since there are 9 feet in a yard). So, if the water is ten times deeper than his height, that means it's 10 x 9 = 90 yards deep. Since he stands at 9 feet tall, we divide the depth of the water by 9 to get the distance: distance = 90 yds / 9 = 10 yds. Therefore, the water is 10 yards away from him.
Response:  We know that Dean is shorter than Ron by 0.8 meters (1.8 - 1.0 = 0.8). Since the water is twice as deep as the sea, we can assume that the depth of the water is equal to 2 times 4 meters = 8 meters. So, if Ron was 4 meters deep in the water, then Dean would be 8 - 0.8 = 7.2 meters deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is 3 meters taller than Ron, so if Ron was 4 meters deep in water, then Dean would be 7 meters deep (3 + 4 = 7). Since the water is five times deeper than the sea, and Ron was 4 meters deep, then Dean would be 20 meters deep (5 x 4 = 20). Therefore, the depth of the water is 20 meters.
Response:  We know that Dean is taller than Ron by one meter (Dean - Ron = 1 m). Since the water is 15 times deeper than the sea level, we can say that the depth of the water is equal to 15 x 4 = 60 meters. So, if Ron was 4 meters deep in the water, then the depth of the water would be 60 - 4 = 56 meters.
Response:  We know that Dean is 9 feet (or 2.7 meters) taller than Ron. So if Ron was 4 meters deep in water, which is equivalent to 13 feet or 4 meters, then Dean would be 15 feet (or 4.6 meters) deeper than Ron. Therefore, the depth of the water where Dean swam is 15 + 4 = 19 meters.
Response:  We know that the water is 9 times deeper than the sea and that Vis is 5 meters high and Dean is 1 meter shorter than Ron. So, if we assume that Ron is at a depth of x meters in the water, then Dean will be at a depth of x - 1 meters. Since Vis is 5 meters high, he will be at a depth of 5 + (x-1) = 6 meters below the surface of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water where Vis and Dean are swimming is 6 meters.
Response:  If Bryan has 34 books and they are divided into two boxes, then he must have had 17 books in each box. So, Bryan has 17 + 17 = 34 books altogether.
Response:  If Bryan has 42 books in total and he has two books left on his shelves, then we can assume that he must have had at least 40 books on his shelves initially. Therefore, if he has 40 books on each of 5 bookshelves (as suggested in the problem), then he would have 200 books in total (40 x 5 = 200). So, Bryan has 200 books in total.
Response:  If Bryan has 27 books and 80 magazines left of his 23 shelves, then he must have had a total of 23 x 27 = 591 books and magazines initially. Now, if he has 80 magazines left, that means he has 80 / 23 = 3.48 books per shelf (rounded to nearest whole number). So, Bryan has approximately 348 books in total.
"Response:  If Bryan has 9 books and 46 magazines on one shelf, then he must have more than 50 (9 + 46) items in total. So, if he has ten shelves with the same number of books and magazines each, then he has:

Total number of books = 9 x 10 = 90 books
Total number of magazines = 46 x 10 = 460 magazines
Therefore, Bryan has 90 books and 460 magazines in total."
Response:  If Bryan has 23 books and 61 magazines left of his 29 shelves, that means he had a total of 23 + 61 = 84 items on those shelves initially. So, in total, Bryan has 84 books and magazines.
"Response:  If Bryan has 7 shelves with 7 books each (49 books in total), and he wants to know how many books he would have if he had 28 books in total, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of books = Total number of books / Number of shelves
= 49 books / 7 shelves
= 6.857 books (approximately)
Therefore, Bryan has approximately 6857 books if he has 28 books in total."
Response:  If Bryan has 2 books on each shelf and there are 4 shelves, then he has 2 x 4 = 8 books total.  Since he also has 38 books in all, we can deduce that he must have at least 38 / 8 = 5 shelves full of books.
Response:  If each of the 10 friends invited 2 guests, then there would be a total of 40 people at the party (10 x 2 = 20). Since you mentioned that some of the guests may bring their own guests, let's assume that half of them do (i.e., 10 out of 20 guests bring one guest each, for a total of 5 additional guests). Therefore, in total, there will be 45 people at the party (20 + 5 = 45). So, the correct answer is 45.
Response:  If Carol sent out an invitation to 12 people and she bought three packages of invitations with the same number, then we know that each package contains 4 invitations (since there are 3 packages). Therefore, if many invitations have you in the remaining package, it means that you have 4 + x invitations where x is the number of invitations left in the last package. So, the answer is 4 + x.
Response:  If Carol sent out birthday invitations to her friends and she had 10 in mind when packing the envelopes, then she must have bought at least 10 x 7 = 70 envelopes. Since she only has two friends, it means that she has 70 - 2 = 68 unused envelopes left over. Therefore, the correct answer is 68.
Response:  If Carol sent out birthday invitations to her friends and she had 14 of them in mind when packing the invitations, then she must have bought at least 14 packages of invitations. Since she also bought 6 additional packages, that means she has a total of 20 packages (14 + 6 = 20). Therefore, the number of friends Carol can invite is 20 / 11 = 18.
Response:  If Carol sends out birthday invitations to her friends and has 3 invitation cards in her possession, she will need to buy more if she wants to invite 9 friends. So, the answer is 3 (the number of invitation cards she already has) + 6 (the number of additional invitation cards needed to invite 9 friends). Therefore, the total number of invitation cards Carol needs to buy is 9.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in one quarter of the game and she played for many quarters, then we can calculate her total score as follows: Total score = Number of quarters x Score per quarter Therefore, if Melissa played for many quarters, her total score would be: Total score = Many quarters x 12 points/quarter =? (insert calculation) Based on the information provided, Melissa's total score is 144 points (Many quarters x 12 points/quarter).
Response:  In the first game, Melissa scored 81 points and played for 3 camps. So in one camp, she scored 27 points (81/3). Now, let's find out how many points she scored in the second game. If she played for 4 camps this time, then she scored 328 points (81 x 4) in total. And if she played for 5 camps, she scored 405 points (81 x 5). Therefore, the correct answer is option B - She scored 328 points in the second game.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points in the last game and also got 82 points in bonus. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can add these two numbers together: 109 + 82 = 191. So, Melissa scored 191 points in the 79 games she played.
Response:  If Melissa scored 21 points in one game and then scored 7 points in another game, we can calculate how many games she played as follows:  Points scored in first game = 21 Points scored in second game = 7 Total points scored = 21 + 7 = 28 Therefore, Melissa played 28 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in 13 international matches, that means she averages about 7 points per match (91/13). Now, if you want to know how many points she scored in her last match, we can calculate it as follows: Points scored in last match = Average points per match x Number of matches played Since Melissa has played 13 matches so far, and her average is 7 points per match, we can calculate the number of points she scored in her last match as follows: Points scored in last match = 7 x 13 = 91 Therefore, Melissa scored 91 points in her last match.
Response:  If there are four seating areas in the parking lot and 20 people can pay for an hour of sitting, then we need to divide 20 by the number of seating areas to find out how many people can sit in each area. So, if there are four seating areas, then 20 / 4 = 5 people can sit in each area. Therefore, five people can sit in each of the four seating areas at any given time.
Response:  If there are 9 people in one cabin and 18 can sit on one wheelchair, then we need to find out how many cabins it takes for all 18 people to sit on one wheelchair.  Therefore, we divide 18 by 9, which gives us 2. So, Fars Hjul has capacity of 2 cabins.
"Response:  We have:

* The quarter parking lot in the park has 19 parking spaces.
* Each parking space can accommodate 1 car.
* There are 15 people who can fit on each parking lot.
* Can many cars fit on the same time?

So, we need to calculate how many cars can fit at the same time. To do this, we divide the number of parking spaces (19) by the number of people who can fit on each parking space (15):

Number of cars that can fit at the same time = Number of parking spaces / Number of people per parking space
= 19 / 15
= 1.267 (or approximately 13 cars)

Therefore, the answer is 13 cars can fit on the same time."
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in each of the Ferris wheels and 10 people are sitting in them, then we can calculate how many times 10 goes into 18 as follows:

10 / 18 = x
x = 6
So, there are 6 groups of 10 people who can fit in the Ferris wheel."
Response:  If there are six seats in the parking lot and 16 people sitting there, then we have to divide 16 by 6 to find out how many people can fit per seat. So, the answer is 2.5 people per seat.
Response:  We know that there are two small boats and 23 large boats in the park. Since each small boat can seat 7 people, we have 7 x 2 = 14 people who can ride on them. Now, let's count how many people can ride on each of the large boats. There are 54 rooms in the big room, so each large boat can carry 54 / 23 = 2.3 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on all the boats is 14 + (2.3 x 23) = 69 people.
Response:  The big wheel in Paradise Park has three seats and seven small seats. One-quarter of these can accommodate 16 people on narrow sidecars and 12 on large sidecars. Can many people ride on one Ferris wheel?  Numeric answer: 3 x 7 = 21
Response:  If there are 16 people riding at the same time on a roller coaster in Paradise Park and if 4 seats are in one car, then how many cars can carry passengers simultaneously? We know that 4 seats fit in each car, so we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many cars can be used at once. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  If one human can ride on a gong on a roulette wheel in Paradise Park, and there are two seats left on the roulette wheel, how many people can sit on it?  We know that each seat can hold one person, so if we have two seats remaining, then we can accommodate two more people. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have 7 pizzas with equal slices of cheese. If we had 14 pieces in total, how many slices would each piece have then? So, the answer is 2 (pieces).
Response:  If we ordered 28 slices of pizza and received 2, then we must have ordered multiple pizzas. To find out how many pizzas we ordered, we can divide 28 by 2, which gives us 14 pizzas. Therefore, we must have ordered 14 pizzas.
Response:  If there are 25 of us and each pizza has 4 slices, then we need to divide 25 by 4 to find out how many pizzas we can buy with our money. So, the answer is 6.
Response:  We have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we divide them equally among ourselves, then we will get 9/2 = 4.5 pizzas per person. Since we can't have half a pizza, the remaining pizza will be unevenly divided among us.
Response:  We know that Paige helped Mor plant flowers so they could plant more plants. However, we cannot see it because there are no words to describe it. Therefore, we can conclude that Paige and Mor planted at least 45 plants.
Response:  If Paige helped Mor plant flowers and they had 45 seeds in 9 different flower pots, then we can assume that each pot contained an equal number of seeds (since they were divided equally among the pots). So, if Dei set one seed in each of the remaining four flower pots, how many seeds would they have added in total?  Therefore, the correct answer is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 additional seeds.
Response:  If Paige and Mor planted 36 seeds in total, and they put 12 seeds in each of 4 flower beds, then the number of flowers is:  Number of flowers = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per flower bed  Number of flowers = 36 / 4 = 9 So, many flowers have Paige and Mor had?  Many flowers = Number of flowers x Number of flower beds  Many flowers = 9 x 4 = 36
Response:  If they planted 55 seeds and put 15 in each of 4 flower beds, that means they have 55 - 15 = 40 remaining seeds. So, many flowers did they sell?  Answer: 40.
"Response:  If Paige helped Mor plant flowers and they put 10 seeds in each rose bush, then... (1) How many seedlings will there be if they sowed 60 seeds per person? (2) Can we calculate how many flowerbeds they need to make based on this number of seedlings?

Solution:
(1) To find out how many seedlings there will be if they sowed 60 seeds per person, we can use the following calculation: Number of seedlings = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per rose bush x Number of rose bushes. In this case, the total number of seeds is 600 (60 seeds/person x 10 persons). So, the number of seedlings will be: Number of seedlings = 600 / 10 / 10 = 6000 seedlings.

(2) Now that we know the number of seedlings, we can calculate how many flowerbeds they need to make based on this number. Since each rose bush needs about 3-4 square feet of space, they will need at least 6000 / 3 = approximately 2000 square feet of land for all the seedlings to grow. This means they will need around 2000 / 10 = approximately 200 flowerbeds to accommodate all the seedlings."
Response:  If Paige helped Mor plant 8 different species of flowers and they planted 32 seeds in total, then we know that each species has an equal number of seeds. So if they planted 32 seeds in total, then they must have planted 4 seeds per species (since 32 / 8 = 4). Therefore, many fr√∏ had they sowed.
Response:  If Matthew gave two balls of butter to his friends, and each ball contains 400 grams of butter, then he gave a total of 800 grams of butter to his friends. So, if many people shared this amount equally, they would have gotten 200 grams of butter each.
Response:  If Matthew gave 2 cups of coffee to each of his 4 friends, then he gave a total of 8 cups of coffee (2 x 4 = 8). So, the correct answer is 8.
"Response:  If Matthew gave five of his small kettles to his friends and each friend received ten bolts, then...

Matthew had 15 small kettles (SM).
He gave 5 of them to his friends (GIVEN).
Each friend received 10 bolts (RECEIVED).
So, the total number of bolts given away is 5 x 10 = 50 bolts (GIVEN + RECEIVED).
Therefore, there are 50 - 15 = 35 bolts left with Matthew (LEFT)."
Response:  If Matthew gave three of his friends equally many balls and each friend had 17 apples, then how many balls did Matthew give in total?  We know that Matthew had 24 small kettles (sm√∏rbr√∏d). So if he gave three friends equally many balls, he must have given out 3 x 24 = 72 balls in total.
"Response:  If Matthew gave away all of his 34 small cakes equally among his friends, each friend would receive:

$$ \text {Number of small cakes per friend} = \frac{\text{Total number of small cakes}}{\text{Number of friends}} $$

Given that Matthew had 22 large cakes and 34 small cakes, the total number of cakes he had is:

$$ \text {Total number of cakes} = 22 + 34 = 56 $$

So, if Matthew gives away all of his small cakes equally among his $5$ friends, each friend will receive:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of small cakes per friend} = \frac{56}{5} = 11} $$

Therefore, each friend will get $11$ small cakes from Matthew."
Response:  If Matthew gave away 29 big cookies and 30 small cookies, then he must have given away a total of 59 cookies (29 + 30 = 59). So, if he gives away the same number of small cookies as big cookies, then he will give away 59 small cookies to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave away 14 small cookies and he had 21 small cakes, then he must have given away half of his total number of small cakes (since he only has 21). So, if he gave away half of his small cakes, that means he gave away 10.5 small cakes (since you can't give away a fraction of a cake). Therefore, Matthew gave away 10.5 small cakes to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave away 18 of his small balls to many people, and each person got an equal number of small balls (not necessarily the same amount), then he would have given away a total of 18 x (number of people) =... small balls. Since we are not told how many people received the small balls, we cannot determine the exact value of.... However, if there were 36 small kitchens, and each kitchen contained many small balls, then Matthew would have given away a total of 18 x 36 =... small balls. Again, since we do not know the actual number of small kitchens or the number of small balls in each kitchen, we cannot provide an exact answer.
Response:  If Matthew gave out 12 cups of coffee to his friends, and he had 36 small cakes to share among them, then he would have given each friend 3/4 of a cup of coffee (since there are 36 small cakes divided by 12 friends). So, if Matthew gave out 12 cups of coffee to his friends, he gave each friend approximately 3/4 of a cup of coffee.
Response:  If Matthew has 23 small kettles and gives away half of them (i.e., 11), then he must have started with an odd number of kettles (since dividing by 2 leaves a remainder). Therefore, the original number of kettles was 23 + 1 = 24. So, Matthew gave away 11 out of 24 kettles, which means he has 13 left.
Response:  If Matthew has 31 small kettles and gives each of his five friends 7 (which is half of 31), then he will have 31 - 5 x 7 = 31 - 35 = -4 small kettles left after giving them away. So, many small kettles did Matthew give to his friends.  Therefore, the correct answer is -4.
Response:  If Matthew gave away some small cakes to all his friends, and he initially had 32 small cakes and 98 more small cakes, then we can calculate how many small cakes he meant in total. So, the total number of small cakes Matthew had is: 32 + 98 = 130. Therefore, Matthew meant that he had 130 small cakes in total.
Response:  If Matthew initially had 10 small cakes and gave some away to all his friends, then he must have taken some from the initial amount of 10. So, the number of small cakes he took was equal to the number of friends he gave them to minus the original amount of 10. In this case, if he gave 8 small cakes to his friends, then he took 2 small cakes (8 - 10 = 2). Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Matthew gave away 28 small cakes to all his 28 friends. That means he had 28 - 28 = 0 small cakes left for himself. Then, he gave some of those remaining cakes to each of his 15 friends. So, he gave away 0 / 15 = 0 cakes per friend. Therefore, Matthew had 0 + 0 = 0 small cakes left after giving them away.
"Response:  If Deeble drank 109 bottles of water per day and each bottle held 74 days worth of water, then she would have drunk a total of:

$$ \text {Total number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Number of days }}{ \text{ Number of bottles per day}} $$

Given that Deeble drank $109$ bottles per day, we can calculate the total number of bottles as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Total number of bottles} &= \frac{109}{\text{number of bottles per day}} \\&= \frac{109}{109} \\&= 1 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, Deeble would have bought $\boxed{1}$ bottle."
Response:  We know that Deeble bought 153 bottles of water when they were on sale and then drank an equal number of bottles per day. If she drank 153 bottles in 17 days, how many bottles did she drink per day? To find out, we can divide the total number of bottles drunk (153) by the number of days she drank them (17): 153 / 17 = 9 bottles per day. Therefore, Deeble drank 9 bottles of water per day.
Response:  We know that Dee bought 264 bottles of water when they were on sale and then drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days. To find out how many bottles she has left, we can use the following formula: Number of bottles left = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles drunk So in this case, the total number of bottles is 264 (the number she bought) minus the number of bottles she drank which is 15 x 11 = 165 Therefore, Dee has 99 bottles left.
Response:  We know that Deeble bought 301 bottles of water when they were on sale and then drank 144 bottles in several days. To find out how many days she has been drinking, we can divide the number of bottles left by the number of bottles drunk per day. So, if she has 157 bottles left, and she drank 144 bottles per day for x number of days, then we can set up an equation as follows:  Number of bottles left = 157  Number of bottles drunk per day = 144  X =? Solving for X, we get: X = 6 days Therefore, Deeble has been drinking for 6 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of beer when they were on sale, then she has a total of 101 bottles (88 + 13 = 101).  If she drinks 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of beer per day, it means that she will finish all her bottles in 13 days (87 / 8 = 10.9 days). So, the correct answer is 10-13 days.
Response:  If they bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of beer when they were on sale, then they have a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If they drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of beer per day, it means they will finish all their drinks in 9 days (312 / 40 = 9).
Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and she bought 12 bottles in total, then after how many days will they run out? We can calculate this as follows: Number of bottles = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles used per day x Number of days So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of bottles = 12 / 6 = 2 x 30 = 60 days Therefore, it would take Debbie 60 days to finish all 12 bottles of water if she drinks 6 bottles per day.
Response:  If they drink 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of beer per day, respectively, it means that in one day they will consume 79 bottles (15 + 54 = 79). Now, if we divide this number by the total number of bottles they bought (95 for water and 180 for beer), we get: Number of days to finish the bottles = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption  Number of days to finish the bottles = 95/79 = 12 days So, they would finish all the bottles in approximately 12 days.
"Response:  If they drink 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of beer per day, in how many days will the bottles last?  We know that there are 360 bottles of water and 162 bottles of beer in total. So, if they drink at this rate for one day, it will take them:

Days = Total number of bottles / Daily consumption
= 360 / 122
= 3 days
So, they will run out of bottles in 3 days."
Response:  If Faye has 14 sticks with 11 apples on one side of the potatoes, then she must have __________ apples on the other side of the potatoes.
"Response:  If Faye laid 3 different rows with 12 buttons each, and she put many buttons on each row, then we can calculate the total number of buttons as follows:

Row 1: 12 buttons x 3 rows = 36 buttons
Row 2: 12 buttons x 3 rows = 36 buttons
Row 3: 12 buttons x 3 rows = 36 buttons
Total number of buttons = 36 + 36 + 36 = 108 buttons
Therefore, Faye had placed 108 buttons on her three rows."
Response:  We know that Faye has 16 pencils in one box and 28 pens in another box. Of these, she has 24 pens left after giving some away. So, we can calculate how many pencils she gave away as follows: Number of pencils given away = Total number of pencils - Number of pencils left = 16 - 24 = -8 pencils. Therefore, Faye gave away 8 pencils.
Response:  We know that Faye has 22 pencils in one box and six pens in another box. That means she has 22 + 6 = 28 items altogether. So, Faye has 28 pencils or pens.
Response:  If Faye has 5 blank sheets of paper in one row and she has 35 blanks and 7 colors to work with, then we can assume that each sheet of paper requires at most 7 colors (since there are only 7 colors available). Therefore, if Faye wants to make as many rows as possible, she should use all 35 blanks for her designs. This means that she will have 5 blank sheets of paper per row, resulting in a total of 70 rows (5 x 14 = 70). So, the answer is 70 rows.
Response:  If Faye has 4 pens on one row and 27 pens on another row, then she has in total 4 + 27 = 31 pens. So, Faye has 31 pens.
Response:  We know that Faye has 7 rows with 36 pens and 30 ink in each row. So, we can calculate the total number of colors used as follows:  Number of colors = Total number of pens x Total number of ink  In this case, the total number of pens is 7 x 36 = 252 pens. The total number of ink is 7 x 30 = 210 ink. Therefore, Faye has used 252 + 210 = 462 different colors.
Response:  We know that Faye has laid out 31 blanks and 27 colored pencils in one row. To find out how many total items she has, we can simply add these numbers together: 31 + 27 = 58. So, Faye has a total of 58 items.
"Response:  If Faye has 30 balls and he wants to give each of his friends one ball, then he will have given away 30 balls in total. So, the number of friends he can have is:

$$ \frac{30}{5} = 6 $$

Therefore, Faye can have 6 friends."
Response:  If Faye has placed 10 marbles in one row and 5 marbles in another row, then she has a total of 15 marbles (10 + 5).  Since each marble represents 2 pence, Faye has a total of 30 pence (15 x 2 = 30).
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 stickers of biro and he used four pens. So, if we assume that each pen can write one line, then...  Therefore, the number of lines that Faye could have drawn is: 35 / 4 = 8.75 lines.
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 pens (styluses) and she uses one of them to draw. So, after using one pen, she has 30 left. Then, she takes another pen from her bag, which means she now has 29 pens left. Finally, she says no when asked if she wants to take another pen, so we can conclude that she still has 29 pens in total. Therefore, the answer is 29.
Response:  We know that Faye has 71 pencils and 24 erasers in one row. So, if many pencils have she, we can assume that each row contains at least 71 pencils (since there are 7 rows). Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is: 7 x 71 = 497 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Faye has laid down 16 rows of pens with 6 pens in each row and 21 pens in the last row. So, we can calculate the total number of pens as follows:

Total number of pens = Number of rows x Number of pens in each row
= 16 x 6
= 96 pens

Therefore, the correct answer is 96."
Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school building and 98 students attending the school. If all seven buses are full, then we need to calculate how many seats are available per bus.  Therefore, if all seven buses are full, then the total number of sitting places available is: 7 x 50 = 350. So, there are 350 sitting places available for students who do not attend school by bus.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in school and each class has 30 students on average (this is just an assumption). So, we have:
Number of classes = 84
Average number of students per class = 30
Now, let's find out how many students are in total at the school:
Total number of students = Number of classes x Average number of students per class
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
So, there are approximately 2520 students at the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 students in school and they have to take a field trip. There are 66 children per class, so we need to divide the total number of students by the number of classes to find out how many buses will be needed. Therefore, the answer is: 67 / 66 = 10 buses.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 lessons and 58 students at school. Since each class has an equal number of students, we can assume that each class has 16 students (87 / 58 = 16). Therefore, there will be 16 classes in total. As there are two sitting places in each bus, we need 8 buses to transport all the students to school (16 classes x 2 sitting places per class = 32 seats; 32 seats / 8 buses = 4 seats per bus). So, yes, many buses will be needed to take all the students to school."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in the school building and each class has an equal number of students (born). Therefore, we can say that the total number of students in all classes is 24 x 120 = 2880. Since there are only 84 seats available in the buses, it means that not all students from one class will fit into a single bus. So, to find out how many students are in each class, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available in the buses: 2880 / 84 = 35 classes. Therefore, there are approximately 35 classes with around 10-12 students per class.
Response:  We have 66 students in total and 102 birthdays at school. If 22 students do not want to take the bus, how many buses will we need then?  Therefore, we will need 8 buses.
"Response:  If there are 102 lessons and 8 students who do not want to go, then we have:

Number of students willing to go = Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go
= 102 - 8
= 94

So, 94 students would be willing to go on the school trip."
Response:  We know that there are 72 students in the school and 3 bus seats available. To find out how many buses are needed to transport all the students, we can divide the number of students by the number of bus seats: Number of buses = Number of students / Number of bus seats = 111 students / 3 bus seats = 37 buses Therefore, 37 buses would be needed to take all the students on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 46 buses for school transportation and 92 students at the school. Since all buses are not full, we need to find out how many seats are available in each bus.  To do this, let's assume that each bus has an average of 50 seats (this is just an estimate, as it may vary depending on the size of the bus). So, the total number of seats available in all 46 buses is:  Number of seats = Total number of buses x Average number of seats per bus = 46 x 50 = 2300 seats Now, we need to find out how many empty seats are left after dividing the total number of seats by the number of students who use the school transportation service.  Empty seats = Total number of seats / Number of students using transportation = 2300 / 92 = 25 seats Therefore, there are 25 empty seats in the 46 buses used for school transportation.
Response:  If Haley gave away 9 gold coins to the poor, and each coin can buy 10 loaves of bread, then...
Response:  If Haley has 10 balls and they get 5 of them back, then we have 10 - 5 = 5 remaining balls with Haley. So, many of the balls that were taken away from Haley will be returned to him is 5.
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, that means she will have 7 marbles left after giving some away to the other children.
Response:  If Haley has 26 guitars and there are 13 guitars left in her classroom, then she must have had 49 guitars at some point (since 13 + 26 = 49). Now, if there are 50 guitars left in the room after Haley took some away, that means that Haley took away 50 - 49 = 1 guitar from the room. So, one guitar is missing from the room after Haley took some away.
Response:  If Haley has 20 small claws and they play with balls in class, then each ball can be divided into how many parts?  We know that there are 5 claws for each hand (since we have 10 hands), so if Haley divides one ball into 5 parts, she will need to use all of her claws. Therefore, the number of balls that Haley can divide is equal to the number of claws she has multiplied by the number of parts she needs per ball. In this case, it would be 20 claws x 5 parts = 100 parts. So, many balls can Haley divide? The answer is 100.
Response:  If Haley has 28 balls and gives two away every hour, then after one hour she will have 28 - 2 = 26 balls left. After another hour, she will give two more away, so now she has 26 - 2 = 24 balls left. Continuing this process, we can calculate that after n hours, Haley will have 24 x (n-1) balls left. Therefore, if many boys had 28 balls each, they would have together 28 x number of boys = 1760 balls.
Response:  We know that Frank wrote through his favorite pen. So he must have written at least one page per day (let's assume). Now we need to calculate how many days it took him to write the entire book of 392 pages.  To do this, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he wrote per day: 392 / 14 = approximately 27 days. Therefore, Frank spent around 27 days writing his book.
Response:  We know that Frank has read through his favorite book 22 pages per day and spent 569 days on making the whole book. So, we can calculate the number of pages in the book as follows: Number of pages = Total time taken to make the book / Time taken to read one page Therefore, Number of pages = 569 days / 22 pages/day = 26,170 pages Now, since there are 30 pages in each signature (as mentioned in the problem statement), we can divide the total number of pages by the number of signatures to get the number of signatures: Number of signatures = Total number of pages / Number of pages in each signature = 26,170 pages / 30 pages/signature = 87,533 signatures Hence, the book contains 87,533 signatures.
Response:  We know that Frank wrote a book with 612 pages and 24 chapters in six days. To calculate how many pages he read each day, we can use the following formula: Number of pages read = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 612, and the time taken to read the book is six days. So, if we divide 612 by 6, we get the average number of pages read per day: Average number of pages read per day = 612 / 6 = 102 pages read per day Therefore, Frank read approximately 102 pages per day while writing his book.
Response:  We know that Frank wrote the book in 220 days and there are 555 pages with five main chapters. So, we can calculate the number of words per day as follows: Number of words = Total number of words / Time taken to write the book Time taken to write the book = 220 days Number of words per day = Total number of words / Time taken to write the book = 555 x 1000 (since each page has 500 words) / 220 = approximately 2467 words per day. Therefore, if Frank spent 220 days writing the book, he must have written at least 2467 words every day.
Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to write his book and it has 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To calculate how many chapters he read per day, we can use the following formula: Number of chapters read per day = Total number of chapters / Time taken to write the book. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of chapters read per day = 193 / 660 = 0.29 chapters per day. So, Frank read approximately 0.29 chapters per day during the time he spent writing his book.
Response:  We know that Frank read through many books and that one book had 249 pages. If Frank took 3 days to read the entire book, then we can calculate how many pages he read each day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 249, and the time taken to read the book is 3 days. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per day is: Number of pages read per day = 249 / 3 = 86 pages per day So, Frank read 86 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank wrote the book in 12 days and it has 66 pages. Therefore, he wrote 66/12 = 5.5 pages per day. Now, we are asked how many books Frank would have read if it took him 492 days to read the entire book. So, we need to divide the number of pages in the book (66) by the time it took Frank to read it (492): 66 / 492 = 0.13 books per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, Frank would have read approximately 0.13 x 7 = 0.87 books per week.
Response:  If it took him 16 days to write his book (which has 112 pages), then he wrote an average of 8 pages per day.
"Response:  If Frank can write 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then he needs:

Time = Number of days / Number of pages written per day
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank would need approximately 72 days to write the entire book if he writes 8 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank wrote the book in 30 days and it has 450 pages. Therefore, he read an average of pages per day. To find out how many pages he read each day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days he took to write the book. So,  pages/days = pages/day. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: pages/day = pages/30 days = pages/day. Solving for pages/day, we get pages/day. Thus, Frank read approximately pages each day while writing his book.
Response:  We know that Frank wrote his favorite book in 607 days and it has 594 pages. To find out how many pages are left to write, we can divide the number of days by the number of pages per day:  Number of pages per day = Number of days / Total number of pages  In this case, the total number of pages is 594 + (Number of days - 607) = 594 + (-607) = 138 Page left to write = Total number of pages - Number of pages written  Therefore, there are 138 pages left to write in the last chapter of Frank's book.
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to write his book and it has 2 chapters with a total of 405 pages. To calculate how many pages he read each day, we can use the following formula: Number of pages read = Total number of pages / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 405, and the time taken to read the book is 664 days. So, if we divide 405 by 664, we get approximately 0.63 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.63 pages per day during the time he spent writing his book.
"Response:  If you can get a six-pack of DVDs for $120 per day, then each individual DVD must cost approximately $20 per day. Therefore, the price of one package (or ""pakka"") of DVDs would be around $600 ($20 x 30 days)."
Response:  If one package of 81 dollars costs how many DVDs that cost $33 each, we can calculate it as follows: Number of DVDs = Cost of one package / Cost of one DVD $ Number of DVDs = 81 / 33 $ Number of DVDs = 2 $ Therefore, if one package of 81 dollars costs how many DVDs that cost $33 each is 2.
"Response:  We know that the cost of one DVD is $106 and we want to find out how many packages of DVDs can be purchased with $93. To do this, we need to divide the total cost of one DVD ($106) by the price of each package of DVDs ($93). So, the number of packages of DVDs that can be purchased with $93 is:

$106 / $93 = 1.14 (or approximately 114 packages)
Therefore, if you have an excess of $93, you can purchase approximately 114 packages of DVDs at a cost of $106 per DVD."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out what is the market price of these drinks. To do this, we can check online retailers or visit local stores and compare prices. Once we have an idea of the market price, we can calculate how much one bottle costs. For example, if the market price of a bottle of water is $1, then one bottle costs $1. If the market price of a bottle of soda is $2, then one bottle costs $2.
Response:  If you have $104 in reserves and can get $26 per DVD, then how many DVDs can you buy with your reserves? To find out, divide your reserves by the cost of one DVD: $104 / $26 = 4 DVDs. Therefore, you can buy 4 DVDs with your reserves.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one DVD costs $28. Now, if you want two DVDs, then the total cost would be twice $28 = $56. So, the price for two DVDs is $56.
Response:  If we divide the 18 bananas into two groups of any size, then the number of bananas in each group is equal to 18 / 2 = 9.
Response:  If there are many bananas in the collection that Philip sells to me and if I divide them into 140 groups of size 187, then the number of bananas I have is equal to the total number of bananas divided by 140 times the size of each group (187). So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of bananas = Total number of bananas / 140 x Size of each group (187) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of bananas = Numer of bananas in the collection (Philip sold to me) = 187 Bananas per group = Size of each group (187) Therefore, the number of bananas I have is: Number of bananas = 187 / 140 x 187 = 2693 bananas.
Response:  If there are 203 bananas and 63 apple in the collection, then we can divide them into groups as follows: Bananas: 7 groups of 28 bananas each (203 / 7 = 28) Apples: 95 groups of 1 apple each (63 / 95 = 0.66) So, the number of large groups is 7 + 95 = 102. Therefore, the size of the large groups is 102.
Response:  We have 142 bananas and 356 apples in the collection. If we divide the bananas into 47 groups of equal size, each group will contain 142/47 = 3 bananas. Similarly, if we divide the apples into 178 groups of equal size, each group will contain 356/178 = 2 apples. Therefore, the ratio of large to small is 3:2 or 1.5.
Response:  We know that there are 392 bananas in total and we want to divide them into groups of 4. So, how many groups can we make?  Well, if we divide 392 bananas by 4, we get 98 bananas per group. Therefore, there will be 4 groups with 98 bananas each.
Response:  If there are 18 large bananas in Philip's collection and each large banana represents 10 small bananas, then... (1) There are 180 small bananas in total if 18 large bananas represent 10 small ones. So, the answer is 180.
"Response:  If we divide the bananas into two groups of 145 each (since there are 290 bananas in total), then the remaining 45 bananas will be divided among the 87 apple trees. Since each apple tree has 5 bananas, the number of bananas each apple tree gets is:

$$ \frac{45}{87} = 0.52 $$

So, approximately half of the bananas (or $52$ bananas) will go to each apple tree."
"Response:  We have 384 apples and 192 bananas in total. If we divide them into groups of 345 (the number given), then each group will contain: Apples: 384 / 345 = 109; Bananas: 192 / 345 = 57. So, there are 109 apple groups and 57 banana groups."
Response:  If Mor had 38 small cakes and gave away 19 of them, then she had 38 - 19 = 19 small cakes left. So, if she gave away 19 small cakes to guests, there were 19 / 38 = 0.5 or  half as many guests as the number of small cakes she had initially. Therefore, there were 38 / 0.5 = 76 guests.
"Response:  If Mor and Brenda made 14 years ago 30 small cakes (sm√∏rbr√∏d) each, and they can make one cake in 2 minutes, then we can calculate how many minutes it would take them to make all 30 cakes together:

Time = Number of cakes x Time per cake
= 30 x 2 min/cake
= 60 min

So, it would take Mor and Brenda 60 minutes to make all 30 small cakes together if they made them 14 years ago."
"Response:  We know that Mor made 22 small cookies and threw away 17 of them. So, if we divide the number of remaining cookies (5) by the number of small cookies he made (22), we get an estimate of how many small cookies Mor had initially:

Number of small cookies Mor had initially = Number of remaining cookies / Number of small cookies made = 5/22 = 0.23
So, Mor had approximately 23 small cookies in total."
Response:  If Mor made 18 small cakes and 9 guests did not come, then each guest would have received 2 small cakes (18 / 9 = 2). However, if there were more guests than the number of small cakes available, some guests would receive fewer small cakes than others. For example, if there were 10 guests in total, they would divide the 18 small cakes as follows: 10 / 18 = 0.56 per guest. So, some guests might get less than two small cakes each.
Response:  If Mor and Brenda have 14 small kitchens in their house, and they are all born there, then we can assume that each of them has half of the total number of small kitchens (7). Therefore, if they had as many small kitchens as they had years old, Mor would be 28 years old (7 x 4) and Brenda would be 35 years old (7 x 5).
Response:  If Mor had 2 small kettles and made 10 small kettlefuls of soup, then each small kettle could make how many full kettlefuls? So, if Mor had 2 small kettles, she could make 2 x 10 = 20 full kettlefuls of soup. Therefore, there were 20 guests at the party.
Response:  If Frank has 42 apples and wants to know how many oranges he can buy with them, we need to divide the number of apples by the price of one orange. Suppose an orange costs $1.50. Then, we can calculate as follows: Number of oranges = Number of apples / Price of one orange = 42 / 1.50 = 28 So, Frank can buy 28 oranges with his 42 apples.
"Response:  If Frank has $10$ pieces of candy and he puts them in $26$ boxes with $33$ small boxes each, then we can calculate how many pieces of candy he will have left as follows:

$$\text{Total number of pieces of candy} = \text{Number of big boxes} \times \text{Number of small boxes per big box} + \text{Number of big boxes left after filling all small boxes}$$

In this case, we know that there are $26$ big boxes and each big box contains $33$ small boxes, so:

$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Total number of pieces of candy} &= 26 \times 33 + 26 \\
&= 898 \
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, Frank will have $\boxed{898}$ pieces of candy left after putting them in $26$ boxes with $33$ small boxes each."
Response:  If Frank has 33 apples and misses 24 of them, then he has 9 apples left. Now, if we divide 9 apples into 9 different baskets (posers), each basket will contain one apple.
Response:  If Frank has 11 small jars in one big jar (pose), and he has 22 spoons to share among them, then we can calculate how many spoonfuls each jar will have as follows: Number of spoonfuls per jar = Total number of spoonfuls / Number of jars So, if Frank has 22 spoons and wants to divide them equally among 11 small jars, each jar will get approximately 2 spoonfuls (2 x 22 = 44). Therefore, Frank would have 44 spoonfuls in total.
Response:  If Frank has 16 circles and he puts 4 small cells inside two of them, then we can assume that each circle contains 4/16 = 1/4 of one cell. So, if Frank has 16 circles, he will have 16 x 1/4 = 4 cells in total.
Response:  If we have 25 boxes with trefoils and each box contains many packages with trefoils, then... (use mathematical reasoning to arrive at your answer)
Response:  We know that Shirley has 10 boxes with three-leaf clovers inside each box. If she wants to give away five of them, then we can calculate the number of boxes she will have left as follows: Number of boxes remaining = Total number of boxes - Number of boxes given away = 10 - 5 = 5 So, Shirley will have 5 boxes left in her kase after giving away 5 of them.
Response:  If we have 67 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda, then together they contain 76 bottles (67 + 9 = 76). Since each bottle contains 20 fluid ounces (fl oz), then in total, these 76 bottles would contain 1520 fl oz (76 x 20 fl oz/bottle). Therefore, many bottles with water did they have? The answer is 1520 fl oz.
"Response:  If the first group of 22 bottles contained regular cola and the second group of 61 bottles contained diet cola, then we can conclude that many bottles of sweet drinks were consumed.  Therefore, the answer is: Many (or ""mange"") bottles with sweet drinks were consumed."
Response:  We have 30 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda. If we add these two quantities together, we get 30 + 8 = 38 bottles. Now, if we add this total to the number of apples (41), we get 38 + 41 = 79 bottles. So, many bottles did they have in total? The answer is 79.
"Response:  We know that there were 79 bottles of regular soda, 53 bottles of diet soda, and 42 apples. The people said ""You can't see it. You can't see it."" So we have to find out how many bottles of water they had. Since they didn't say anything about the number of apples, let's assume they had 42 apples as before. Now, let's count the number of bottles of water based on their statement: If they said ""You can't see it,"" then it means they couldn't see any water bottles. Therefore, the number of water bottles must be equal to the total number of bottles minus the number of bottles they could see (i.e., regular soda + diet soda). So, the number of water bottles is: Total number of bottles = Regular soda + Diet soda - Number of bottles they could see = 79 + 53 - 42 = 80 bottles Thus, the correct answer is 80 bottles of water."
Response:  The total number of bottles with water is 54 + 83 = 137 bottles. So, many bottles with water did they have? Therefore, the answer is 137.
"Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles of regular soda and 9 bottles of diet soda in total. Since each bottle contains one liter of soda, we have:

Regular soda = 17 x 1 L = 17 L
Diet soda = 9 x 1 L = 9 L

Now, let's consider the number of oranges. The question states that they had 29 oranges. Since an orange is approximately 0.1 liters in volume (assuming it's a small orange), we can calculate the total volume of oranges as follows:

Total volume of oranges = 29 x 0.1 L = 2.9 L

Finally, we need to find out how many times the volume of regular soda is greater than the volume of oranges. To do this, we divide the volume of regular soda by the volume of oranges:

Number of times regular soda is greater than oranges = 17 L / 2.9 L = 5.8 times

Therefore, the answer is 5."
Response:  The text says that there were 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. If they didn't have anything to eat or drink, then they must have brought those bottles with them when they went out. So, the number of bottles they had with them is equal to the total number of bottles they had (19 + 60 = 79). Therefore, the answer is 79.
Response:  We know that the group of people had 72 bottles of regular soda, 32 bottles of diet soda, and 78 apples. They had $20 per day to spend.  They spent $4 per day on something (we don't know what).  So they had $20 - $4 = $16 left each day.  Now let's calculate how many bottles of soda or apples they could buy with their daily budget:  Bottles of regular soda: $16 / $5 per bottle = 3.2 bottles  Bottles of diet soda: $16 / $3 per bottle = 5.3 bottles  Apples: $16 / $1.50 per apple = 10.67 apples  Since we can't have fractional bottles or apples, we round up to the nearest whole number:  Bottles of regular soda: 3 bottles  Bottles of diet soda: 5 bottles  Apples: 11 apples  Therefore, the group of people had more than enough bottles of both regular and diet soda, but not quite enough apples to last them the entire time.
Response:  We know that there are 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. To calculate how many bottles have too much, we need to subtract the number of bottles with too much from the total number of bottles. So, if 54 bottles have too much (slimy), then the remaining bottles would be: 80 - 54 = 26. Therefore, 26 bottles have too much.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 30 flasks in total and 28 of them contained regular soda (not diet). So, the number of flasks containing diet soda is 2 (since 28 - 2 = 26). Now, let's consider the situation where they didn't have anything with them. In this case, the number of flasks containing soda would be 28 (since all 30 flasks were empty if they didn't have anything with them). Next, when they went to the box, they had something with them, so the number of flasks containing soda becomes 27 (since 28 - 1 = 27). Finally, when they returned to the sauce, they again had nothing with them, so the number of flasks containing soda becomes 28 (since all 30 flasks were empty again). Therefore, the correct answer is 28.
"Response:  If each of the four bottles contains 79 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, then we can calculate how many bottles of regular soda they have in total as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles with regular soda x (Number of bottles with regular soda / Number of bottles with diet soda)

Given that there are 4 bottles with regular soda and 36 bottles with diet soda, we can plug these values into the formula to get:

Total number of bottles = 4 x (79 / 36) = 120

Therefore, if the four bottles had more bottles of regular soda than diet soda, they would have 120 bottles of regular soda in total."
Response:  We have 57 bottles of regular soda (R), 26 bottles of diet soda (S), and 27 bottles of little soda (L). Each person has one drink. Therefore, we can say that R + S + L = 100 (total number of bottles). Now let's analyze each group separately: Group R (regular soda): 57 bottles x 1 person per bottle = 57 Group S (diet soda): 26 bottles x 1 person per bottle = 26 Group L (little soda): 27 bottles x 1 person per bottle = 27 Total: 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 So, yes, many bottles did they have together!
Response:  The total number of bottles with regular soda is 81, and the number of bottles with diet soda is 60 + 60 = 120. So, the total number of bottles with liquid is 81 + 120 = 201. Therefore, many bottles with water did they have to drink?  Answer: 201
Response:  We know that: * The person had 49 bottles of regular soda (flaskar). * They had 40 bottles of diet soda (slankekal).* They had 6 bottles of little soda (lite soda). * They had one bottle of water (me). * They had one bottle of juice (av sok). Now let's count how many bottles each type of drink has: Regular Soda: 49 bottles Diet Soda: 40 bottles Little Soda: 6 bottles Water: 1 bottle Juice: 1 bottle Total number of bottles = Regular Soda + Diet Soda + Little Soda + Water + Juice = 49 + 40 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 97 So, the total number of bottles the person had is 97. Therefore, they had more bottles of regular soda than any other type of drink.
Response:  If there were 317 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and Rachel knew it was 295 visitors the day before, then we can conclude that many more people visited Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day. Specifically, if there were X visitors the day before, then there would be X + 162 visitors (317 - 295) on the day of the palace visit. So, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace that day is between X + 162 and 317, inclusive.  Therefore, the correct answer is:  Between X + 162 and 317.
Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and Rachel knew that it was 246 visitors that day, then many people came to Buckingham Palace on 25 days.  Therefore, the answer is 25.
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and Rachel knew that it was 666 visitors the same day, then we can conclude that many more people visited Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day. However, without additional information about the population of London or the number of tourists visiting the palace each day, we cannot determine an exact percentage increase in visitor numbers. Therefore, I will give a numerical answer of ""Not enough information"" (NA)."
Response:  If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day that Rachel visited, and she knew that it was a good meal, then we can assume that the number of visitors is not zero. Therefore, the number of visitors in the last 327 days must be greater than or equal to 406. So, the answer is 406 or more.
"Response:  If 45 people visited Buckingham Palace before Rachel and her friends, and they visited on a day when 829 people visited the palace overall, then we can calculate the average number of visitors per day as follows:

Average number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 9.76 (round to nearest whole number)
Therefore, based on this calculation, it is estimated that approximately 9-10 people visit Buckingham Palace every day."
Response:  If there were 71 tickets sold for the visit to Buckingham Palace and Rachel knew that there were 557 visitors on that day, then we can calculate how many days it was since the previous visit using the information provided in the question.  We know that there were 188 visitors the day before, so if we subtract this number from the total number of visitors on the current day (557), we get the difference between the two numbers: 557 - 188 = 369. Therefore, there were 369 days between the previous visit and the current visit.
Response:  If there were 39 tickets sold to Buckingham Palace and Rachel found out that there were 661 visitors on that day, then we can infer that there were more than 39 people who visited the palace on that day.  To find out how many more people visited, we need to subtract the number of tickets sold from the total number of visitors. So, if there were 661 visitors and 39 tickets sold, then the difference between them is equal to the number of additional visitors beyond the ticket holders. Therefore, the answer is:  Additional visitors = 622 (661 - 39)
Response:  If there were 92 people who visited Buckingham Palace after having a good meal (god maaltid), and Rachel knew that it was 419 visitors the day before and 103 days before that, then we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace as follows:  Total number of visitors = Number of visitors the day after good food + Number of visitors the day before - Number of visitors 103 days before +... + Number of visitors 419 days before  Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace would be:  Total number of visitors = 92 + 419 - 103 +... + 419 = 857  So, there were approximately 857 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question.
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel visited and she knew that it was more than the previous day (when there were 471 visitors), then we can conclude that the number of visitors increased by 41 (from 471 to 512). Therefore, if there were 808 visitors on the day before Rachel's visit, then the total number of visitors over the 89 days would be: 808 + (41 x 89) = 63,681.
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and Rachel knew it was 3 days before Christmas, then we can calculate how many visitors came each day leading up to Christmas using the information provided in the question.  Here is one way to do this calculation:
Day Before Christmas = 3 Days Before + 1 Day (Since Christmas falls on December 25)
Number of Visitors Each Day Leading Up to Christmas = Total Number of Visitors / Number of Days Until Christmas
Using the given numbers, we get:
Number of Visitors Each Day Leading Up to Christmas = 705 / 3 = 235
So, approximately 235 people visited Buckingham Palace each day leading up to Christmas."
"Response:  If he needs an additional 159 grams of meat to make it a match, and the current amount of meat is 628 grams, then we can calculate how many more grams of meat he has as follows:

Additional amount of meat needed = Desired amount of meat - Current amount of meat
= 159 g - 628 g
= -470 g

So, he has negative 470 grams of meat left after adding the desired amount."
Response:  If he needs 49 grams of paint to make one, and he makes Dei, then we need to know how much Dei he makes.  We are given that Dei has 3000 fj√∏rt (fjar), so if he makes Dei, he will use 49 grams x 3000 = 157,000 grams of paint.  Now, let's find out how much vokse he uses.  He uses 288 grams of vokse for every 1000 fj√∏rt (fjar) of paint he uses, so if he uses 157,000 grams of paint, he will use 157,000 / 10 = 15,700 grams of vokse.
"Response:  If he needs 57 grams of paint to make one and only one color, then he will need more than that if he wants to make multiple colors. So let's assume he needs x grams of paint to make y colors. We know that the total amount of paint he has is 22 + 353 = 375 grams. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (y-1) \* 57 = 375...(1)
Now, we are given that he needs 353 grams of wax to cover his canvas. So, we can substitute this value into equation (1):
x + (y-1) \* 57 = 375...(1)
Substituting y = 4 (as there are 4 colors), we get:
x + (4-1) \* 57 = 375...(2)
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 108 grams...(3)
Therefore, he needs approximately 108 grams of paint to create four different colors."
"Response:  If he wants to add more water to make it a match, and if the fat content of the meat is 20 grams per 100 grams, then we need to calculate how many grams of water are needed to reach 166 grams in total. So, we can calculate this as follows:

Total weight = Fat content + Water content
= 20 grams/100 grams x 166 grams
= 33.2 grams (approximately)

Therefore, Ho needs approximately 33.2 grams of water to make it a match."
Response:  If he needs 17 grams of clay to make it into a match and he has 557 grams of wax, how many grams does he have left after subtracting the amount needed for the match? So, we can calculate this as follows: 557 - 17 = 540 grams. Therefore, he has 540 grams of wax left after making the match.
Response:  If he wants to add more clay to make it equal to one match, and he has 11 grams of clay already, then he needs 492 grams - 11 grams = 481 grams more clay.
Response:  If 94 out of 100 participants in the survey said they had 90 tons of grapes per day, that means there were 6 tons of grapes per day that none of the participants had. Therefore, if one person could fill 5 baskets per day with grapes, then many people could fill how many baskets per day?  Solution:  To find out how many baskets one person can fill per day, we need to divide the total number of grapes produced by the number of people involved in the work. In this case, if 6 tons of grapes are left over after all the participants have filled their baskets, then each participant must have filled approximately 6/100 = 0.06 tons of grapes per day. Since there are 10 kilograms (kg) in a ton, we can convert this amount to kg as follows: 0.06 tons x 10 kg/ton = 0.6 kg per day. So, one person can fill approximately 0.6 kg of grapes per day into a basket.
"Response:  If there are 266 people who have to fill 90 baskets with grapes in 5 days, we can calculate how many baskets each person has to fill per day as follows:

Number of people = 266
Number of baskets = 90
Time period = 5 days

To find out how many baskets each person has to fill per day, we divide the total number of baskets by the time period:

Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Time period
= 90 / 5
= 18

So, each person has to fill 18 baskets with grapes per day."
Response:  If they pick 244 baskets of grapes per day and 47 baskets of strawberries per day, then in total they pick 301 baskets of fruit per day (244 + 47 = 301). To find out how many days it takes to fill 146 baskets with fruit, we can divide the number of baskets by the number of baskets picked per day: 146 / 301 = 48 days. So, it would take approximately 48 days to fill 146 baskets with fruit.
Response:  If 221 farmers fill 100 baskets of strawberries per day and they work for 77 days, then the total number of baskets filled is:  Number of baskets = Total number of working days x Number of baskets per day  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Number of baskets = 77 days x 100 baskets/day = 7700 baskets
Response:  If Han spent time watching wine rankings on 24 two-hour TV shows, he got 252 answers to one question about filling 108 barrels with grapes per day. Can many barrels be filled in 58 days?  We need to calculate how much time Han spent watching TV shows and then divide it by the number of barrels that can be filled in that time.  To do this, we will use the following formula:  Time spent watching TV shows / Number of barrels that can be filled = Days required to fill the barrels.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Time spent watching TV shows = 24 x 2 hours/show = 48 hours.  Number of barrels that can be filled = 108.  Therefore, the answer is:  Time spent watching TV shows / Number of barrels that can be filled = 48 hours / 108 barrels = 0.46 days (or approximately 23 hours).
Response:  If there are 36 people working and each person has 8 terniers of grapes per day, then in one day they will have 36 x 8 = 288 terniers of grapes. To fill 240 baskets with grapes, it will take approximately 288 / 240 = 1.17 days. Therefore, it will take around 1 day and 9 hours to fill 240 baskets with grapes.
Response:  If Han had 26 aquariums for marine animals and there were 52 marine animals in each aquarium (except for those that have the same number), then the total number of marine animals he had was:  Number of aquariums = 26  Number of marine animals per aquarium = 52 - Except for those with the same number  Total number of marine animals = Number of aquariums x Number of marine animals per aquarium = 26 x 52 - Except for those with the same number = 1320 - Except for those with the same number Marine animals that had the same number as Han had = 1320 - 52 = 1268 Therefore, many marine animals Han had aquariums.
Response:  If Han has collected 40 aquatic animals in different aquariums and each quarter-filled aquarium contains two animals, then we can calculate the total number of aquariums as follows: Number of aquariums = Total number of animals / Number of animals per aquarium = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums Therefore, Han has 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Han has 56 aquariums with saltwater fish and 10 with freshwater fish. Quarter of an aquarium has 39 fish in it. So, we can calculate how many fish Tyler has as follows:  Number of saltwater fish = 56 / 4 = 14 (since there are 4 quarters in an aquarium) Number of freshwater fish = 10 / 2 = 5 (since there are 2 halves in an aquarium) Total number of fish = 14 + 5 = 19 Therefore, Tyler has 19 fish in his aquarium.
"Response:  We know that Han has 74 fish in his aquarium and he also has 46 fish in his other tank. So, altogether, Han has 120 fish (74 + 46). Now, we are asked if many saltwater fish have Tyler. However, there is no information provided about Tyler or any connection between him and saltwater fish. Therefore, we cannot determine how many saltwater fish Tyler has. As such, the correct answer is ""Not given"" because we do not have enough information to provide an accurate response."
"Response:  We know that Han has 15 arms for sea creatures and 62 arms for freshwater creatures. If we assume that each arm can hold one creature, then Han has in total:

15 x 1 = 15 creatures for sea creatures + 62 x 1 = 62 creatures for freshwater creatures = 77 creatures in total.
Therefore, the correct answer is 77."
"Response:  If one pack contains 13 T-shirts and Mom buys 39 T-shirts, then we can find out how many packs she bought as follows:

Number of packs = Number of T-shirts / Number of T-shirts in each pack
= 39 / 13
= 3

So, Mom bought 3 packs of T-shirts."
Response:  Mamma buys 66 T-shirts with 3 different designs. If each pack contains x shirts, then we can write an equation as follows: 66 = 3x. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 22. Therefore, one pack contains 22 T-shirts.
Response:  If there are 56 T-shirts in each package and Mor buys 28 packages of T-shirts, then the total number of T-shirts that Mor will buy is:  Number of T-shirts = Total number of packages x Number of T-shirts in each package = 28 x 56 = 1492 T-shirts.
Response:  If Mom bought 57 pairs of leg t-shirts and 34 pants, then we know that the number of legs in all those clothes is equal to the number of pairs multiplied by the number of legs per pair. So if there are 57 pairs of leg t-shirts, then each pair has 2 legs (since it's a pair), so the total number of legs is 57 x 2 = 114 legs.
Response:  If one can get three-pack t-shirts (3T), then how many pairs of t-shirts will they have after buying 51 t-shirts in total?  We know that each pack contains 3 t-shirts, so...
Response:  If one can buy 70 T-shirts in a package and Mom buys 14 packages, how many T-shirts has Mom bought?  Solution: To find out how many T-shirts Mom has bought, we need to multiply the number of packages she bought (14) by the number of T-shirts in each package (70). Therefore, Mom has bought 14 x 70 = 980 T-shirts.
Response:  We have 4 sekker with equal number of small cookies in each sekker. So, we can say that there are x small cookies in total from all 4 sekker. Now, we know that there are 36 small cookies altogether. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + x + x + x = 36. Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x = 36. Dividing both sides by 4, we get: x = 9. So, there are 9 small cookies in total.
"Response:  If you have 33 small kitchens and each kitchen has 11 small kitchens, then the total number of small kitchens is:

33 x 11 = 353

So, there are 353 small kitchens in total."
Response:  If Vis had 41 small kitchens and you had 53 small kitchens, then together they would have 94 small kitchens (41 + 53 = 94).
Response:  If you have 14 small pots and each pot contains an equal number of small balls (7), then we can conclude that there are 14 x 7 = 98 small balls in total. So, if you have 7 large bowls with an equal number of small balls inside them, then you will have 7 x 98 = 692 small balls left over after filling all the large bowls. Therefore, the correct answer is 692.
Response:  If Omkar has 3 small pots and you have 21 small pots, then together they have 24 small pots (3 + 21 = 24). So, the number of pokes that Omkar had was 24.
"Response:  We have 26 quarter-pounders and 15 goodies. If we assume that each quarter-pounder requires 3 goodies (a rough estimate), then we can calculate how many goodies are needed for all the quarter-pounders as follows:

Number of quarter-pounders = 26
Number of goodies per quarter-pounder = 3
Total number of goodies needed = Number of quarter-pounders x Number of goodies per quarter-pounder
= 26 x 3
= 78

Now, let's consider the remaining 52 small kiosks. Each small kiosk contains 40 goodies, so we need to subtract this amount from the total number of goodies needed:

Total number of goodies needed - Goodies in each small kiosk = Total number of goodies needed - 40
= 78 - 40
= 38

Therefore, if you had 15 goodies and 52 small kiosks, you would have approximately 38 solar panels."
Response:  We know that you have 14 small balls of quarts (which is equal to 1/4 of a cookie). So, if we divide this number by 4, we get 3.5 small balls per cookie. Now, let's assume that each small ball represents one hot dog. Therefore, if you had 28 small kiosks and 86 goodies, you could make approximately 28 x 86 = 2304 hot dogs.
"Response:  If the mailman delivers five packages every quarter hour and there are 25 letters to be delivered in total, we can calculate how many houses he will visit in one quarter of an hour as follows:

Time taken = Total number of deliveries / Number of deliveries per unit time
= 25 letters / 5 packages/quarter hour
= 5 letters/package x 4 quarters/hour (since there are 4 hours in a quarter hour)
= 20 letters/hour

Now, if we assume that each house is visited once for each letter delivered, then the number of houses visited in one quarter of an hour would be:

Number of houses visited = Total number of deliveries / Time taken
= 25 letters / 20 letters/hour
= 1.25 houses/hour

Therefore, the mailman will visit approximately 1.25 houses in one quarter of an hour."
Response:  If there are 20 houses in one street and the mailman has to deliver 9 packages per house, then the total number of packages he will have to deliver is 20 x 9 = 180 packages.
Response:  If there are six houses in one quarter and the mailman must deliver 24 pieces of mail to each quarter, then... (1) x 6 = 144 pieces of mail per day (2) / 4 quarters = 36 pieces of mail per quarter (3) / 6 houses per quarter = 6 pieces of mail per house per quarter. Therefore, the mailman will have to deliver 6 x 4 = 24 pieces of mail per day.
Response:  The mailman sends 14 letters to 4 homes in each of 4 neighborhoods. If the postal worker must go through two circular routes in each of those neighborhoods, then how many houses does one person have to pass in total? Solution: We can calculate this as follows: Number of households per route = Total number of households / Number of circular routes  In this case, there are 4 neighborhoods with 4 homes each, for a total of 16 homes. Since the postal worker must go through 2 circular routes in each neighborhood, they will pass a total of 2 x 16 = 32 homes. Therefore, one person has to pass 32 houses in total.
Response:  If there are 20 houses in one quarter and each house needs to receive 32 trash bags, then we need to calculate how many trash bags the mailman will have to deliver in total. So, the answer is 640 (20 x 32).
Response:  If there are 30 slop bins for 78 quarter areas, and there are 19 houses in one of those quarters, then we need to divide 30 by 19 to find out how many slop bins each house will get. So, the answer is 1.6 (or 16/19) slop bins per house.
Response:  If the mailman delivers 8 circular letters to each of the 55 quarter sections, then he will deliver a total of 8 x 55 = 440 circular letters in all.  Since he also delivers 32 postcards to each of the 10 homes in each quarter section, he will deliver a total of 32 x 10 = 320 postcards in all. Therefore, there are 440 + 320 = 760 houses in the entire neighborhood.
Response:  The mailman must deliver 4 circular letters to each of the 81 quarterly blocks, which means he has to deliver 324 circular letters in total (4 x 81). Since there are 12 houses in each block, the mailman will have to deliver 27 circular letters per block (324 / 12 = 27).
"Response:  If there are 16 quarters and each quarter has 4 pieces of trash mail to deliver, then the total number of pieces of trash mail to deliver is:

16 quarters x 4 pieces/quarter = 64 pieces of trash mail
So, the postman will have to deliver 64 pieces of trash mail."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 small balls. She wants to divide them into four groups. To do this, we need to find out how many eggs or small balls each group will have.

Let's start with the first group. Since there are 4 groups in total, we can say that the number of eggs or small balls in each group is equal to 1/4 of the total number of eggs or small balls. So, if we divide 10 eggs among 4 groups, each group will get 2.5 eggs (since 10 / 4 = 2.5). Similarly, if we divide 20 small balls among 4 groups, each group will get 5 small balls (since 20 / 4 = 5).

Now, let's check whether many groups were formed. Based on our calculations above, it seems that only two groups were formed - one with 2.5 eggs and another with 5 small balls. Therefore, the answer is ""No""."
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide eggs into five groups, she will need at least 3 eggs for each group (since there are 5 groups). So, in total, she needs 3 x 5 = 15 eggs. Since she has 15 eggs and 10 balls, she can make only 5 groups of eggs. Therefore, the answer is 5 groups.
Response:  If Rebecca has 11 groups of eggs and each group contains 2 eggs, then the total number of eggs is 11 x 2 = 22 eggs. So, Rebecca has 22 eggs in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and she wants to divide them into 4 groups of equal size. Since each group must contain an odd number of eggs (since there are only 4 groups), we can start with dividing the 8 eggs equally among 2 groups. So, Group 1 will have 4 eggs and Groups 2-4 will have 3 eggs each. Now, let's count how many eggs are left over after forming these groups:  Group 1: 4 eggs Group 2: 3 eggs Group 3: 3 eggs Group 4: 3 eggs Total: 12 eggs Left over: 0 eggs Therefore, Rebecca has divided her 8 eggs evenly among 4 groups, leaving no eggs remaining.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 balls and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. Since she cannot have any leftover eggs or balls after dividing them, we can conclude that each group must contain at least one ball and at least one egg. Therefore, there will be 3 groups with at least one ball and at least one egg in each group. So, the answer is 3.
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of six. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these eggs.

To do this, we can use division. We divide 18 by 6 to get the number of groups:

18 √∑ 6 = 3

So, Rebecca can make 3 groups with her 18 eggs. Now let's see what else she has:

She has 72 bananas and 66 balls. Let's assume she wants to distribute these items equally among the groups as well. To do this, we can use multiplication. We multiply 72 by 3 (the number of groups) to get the total number of bananas in each group:

72 √ó 3 = 216

Similarly, we multiply 66 by 3 to get the total number of balls in each group:

66 √ó 3 = 198

Now we have all the information we need to answer the question: Yes, Rebecca can make 3 groups with her 18 eggs, and each group will contain 216 bananas and 198 balls."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 6 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many bananas and eggs each group will have.

Group 1: Bananas - 30 (since there are 99 bananas and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups) + Eggs - 2 ( since there are 6 eggs and she wants to divide them equally among 3 groups) = 30 + 2 = 32 Group 2: Bananas - 35 (since there are 99 bananas left after dividing 30 for Group 1) + Eggs - 3 (since there are 6 eggs left after dividing 2 for Group 1) = 35 + 3 = 38 Group 3: Bananas - 24 (since there are 99 bananas left after dividing 30 for Group 1 and 35 for Group 2) + Eggs - 4 (since there are 6 eggs left after dividing 2 for Group 1 and 3 for Group 2) = 24 + 4 = 28
So, in total, Rebecca has divided her resources into 3 groups of 32, 38, and 28. Therefore, the number of groups she created is 3."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and six small balls. She wants to divide them into five groups. To do this, we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. Since there are five groups in total, each group will get 4 eggs (20 / 5 = 4). Now let's count how many eggs Rebecca has left after dividing them into groups: 6 (small balls) + 4 x 5 (groups) = 24 - 20 = 4 eggs. So, Rebecca has four eggs left after dividing them into five groups. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 balls and 12 eggs. She wants to divide them into 20 groups. To do this, we need to find out how many eggs each group will get.  Since there are 20 groups in total, each group will receive 6 eggs (since 20 / 5 = 4). So, Rebecca has more eggs than marbles.  Therefore, the correct answer is: More eggs than marbles.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points in one round and he got 11 points in the next round, then we can calculate how many points he had left to play with in that round.  We know that Luke scored 154 points in the first round, so he must have used up all his points in that round. Therefore, the number of points he had left to play with in the second round is equal to the total number of points he had minus the points he scored in the first round.  So, if Luke scored 154 points in the first round, he must have had 154 - 11 = 143 points left to play with in the second round.
"Response:  If Luke scored 177 runs in total and he is one of the two players who got most out of everything, then he must have scored at least 46 points per round (since that's how many points he got in the last round). So, if we assume that he played 9 rounds (as the question states), then his average score per round would be:

$$ \text{Average score per round} = \frac{\text{Total scores}}{\text{Number of rounds}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text{Average score per round} = \frac{177}{9} = 20.78 $$
Therefore, Luke scored an average of 20.78 points per round."
"Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after playing two rounds of ""Trivia"" and ""Flat Earth"" from ""The Simpsons,"" then he must have scored some number of points in each round.  We can assume that his score for each round is equal to the number of questions he answered correctly multiplied by the point value associated with each question.  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

Luke's total score = (Number of correct answers in Round 1) x (Point value per question in Round 1) + (Number of correct answers in Round 2) x (Point value per question in Round 2)

We know that Luke scored 84 points overall, so we can set up the following inequality based on this information:

84 > (x + y)

where x represents the number of correct answers in Round 1 and y represents the number of correct answers in Round 2. Since there are 10 questions in each round, we can express x and y as follows:

x = Number of correct answers in Round 1 / 10
y = Number of correct answers in Round 2 / 10

Substituting these expressions into the original inequality, we get:

84 > (x/10 + y/10)

Simplifying this inequality, we obtain:

84 > x + y

Therefore, if Luke scored 84 points, he must have scored at least 84 points in both rounds combined. However, since he played only two rounds, it means that he scored exactly 84 points in one of those rounds. Without further information, we cannot determine which round he scored 84 points in."
Response:  If Luke scored 146 points in one round of the game and he has 157 circles to play with, then we can calculate his total score as follows:  Total score = Number of circles x Points per circle Therefore, Luke's total score would be: Total score = 157 x 146 = 22,392 points
Response:  If Luke scored 78 points in a match and he won 3 points in one round, then he must have played at least 25 rounds (78 / 3 = 25). So, he would have played many games.
Response:  Emily has to make 32 necklaces with 5 beads each. To calculate how many beads she needs in total, we can multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace: 32 x 5 = 160 beads. So, yes, one person could make many perls per halskjede (or necklace).
Response:  We know that Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace contains 4 or 5 pearls. So, in total, she made 11 x 4 = 44 pearl necklaces.
Response:  If Emily has 8 pearls in her necklace and she wants to make many chains, then we can assume that each chain will have 8 pearls. So, if Emily wants to make n chains, then she will need a total of 8n pearls. Since there are 16 pearls in total, Emily can make at most n = 16/8 = 2 chains. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  If Emily has 18 large pearls and she wants to make 6 necklaces with each containing 3 pearls, then we need to calculate how many pearls are needed for one necklace. To do this, we divide the total number of pearls (18) by the number of necklaces (6):

Number of pearls in one necklace = Total number of pearls / Number of necklaces
= 18 / 6
= 3

So, yes, you are correct! You will need 3 pearls for each necklace."
Response:  We know that Emily has 5 beans in total and she laid 4 of them. So, there are 4 - 4 = 0 beans left with her. Therefore, the number of marbles Emily had is 0.
Response:  If Emily has six legs and three of them are missing, then she can make 6 x 3 = 18 halters.
Response:  We know that Emily has to make 43 knots of kransekj√∏l for the 43 veins in her baby's head. She had 5 small teeth in her mouth and could make 20 of them. Can many pearls fit into one necklace?
Response:  We know that Emily made 26 necklaces and she took 2 halskjeder (necklaces) from each of her 44 teeth. So, she took a total of 88 halskjeder from all her teeth. Since each halskjede contains 2 pearls, Emily took a total of 176 pearls from all her teeth. Therefore, there were 176 pearls in Emily's collection.
Response:  We know that in total there are 819,058 children who go to summer camp, and of these, 668,278 stay at home. So, we can calculate the percentage of children who go to summer camp as follows: (Number of children going to summer camp / Total number of children) x 100 =  Percentage of children going to summer camp = (819,058 / 1487,336) x 100 =  Approximately 56% of children go to summer camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that many children go to summer camp in the United States during their summer vacation, so let's assume that half of all children in the US attend summer camp (this is just an assumption).  Then, we also know that many people who are born in the US stay in the country, so let's assume that 75% of those born in the US remain in the country (again, this is just an assumption).  Finally, we want to find out how many people were born in America. To do this, we need to subtract the number of people who were born outside of the US from the total number of births in the US. So if there are 100 births in the US and 25 of them were born outside of the US, then the number of people born in America would be 75 (100 - 25 = 75). Therefore, the answer to the question is 75.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 people in Lawrence County and 629424 of them go to summer camp. This means that 268627 (898051 - 629424) people stay home during summer vacation. So, many people stayed home.
Response:  We know that there are 313 473 people in Lawrence County and they have 274 865 homes. This means that 39 608 people (or 13.3% of the population) do not have a home. Therefore, many more than half of the population go to camp during the summer holidays.
Response:  If there are 907 children in summer camp and 455 children at home, then the number of children at home is:  907 - 455 = 452 children at home.
Response:  We know that 8000 children go to summer camp and 59 youth are there. So, we have 8000 - 59 = 7941 children who stay at home. Now, we need to calculate how many of these 7941 children were born in Lawrence County. To do this, we divide the number of children born in Lawrence County (828521) by the total number of children (7941). This gives us an estimate of how many children born in Lawrence County stayed at home during the summer vacation: 7941 / 828521 = 0.096 or approximately 9.6%. Therefore, about 9.6% of the children born in Lawrence County stayed at home during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 61619 people living in Stansa, and the other kids went to camp. So, the total number of kids in Lawrence County is 91676 - 61619 = 30057. Therefore, many of the kids in Lawrence County have gone to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 424 944 foreign-born children in Norway during summer vacation. If some of them go to camp and others stay at home, we can assume that not all of them will attend camp. So let's say 50% of them attend camp. This means that 212 472 (50% x 424 944) foreign-born children attend camp.
Response:  We know that in summer vacation, 610 769 children go to camp, while 590 796 stay at home. Additionally, there are 22 foreign-born children. How many children does your nursery have?  Solution: To find out how many children my nursery has, we need to subtract the number of children who stay at home from the total number of children who go to camp or come from abroad. Therefore, the answer is:  Children in my nursery = 610 769 - (590 796 + 22) = 387 973
Response:  We know that in total there were 721,340 births during the last five years (644,997 + 89,383 + 78). Since we are asked about the number of births in Lawrence County specifically, we can calculate it as follows: Number of births in Lawrence County = Total number of births x Percentage of births in Lawrence County / 100 Lawrence County has approximately 1% of the state population, so if we multiply the total number of births by this percentage, we get: Number of births in Lawrence County = 721,340 x 1/100 = 7,213 Number of born in Lawrence County = 7,213 So, to answer the question, there were approximately 7,213 born in Lawrence County over the last five years.
Response:  Adam has 3 apples for Jackie and he has 9 apples in total. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Adam has for Jackie (3), then Jackie must have 6 apples left (9 - 3 = 6).
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, Adam has more apples than Jackie. Therefore, the answer is 5 (Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie).
Response:  Jackie has ten apples and Adam has nine apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the difference between their numbers is:  10 - 9 = 1. Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
"Response:  Jackie has ten apples and Adam has eight apples. To find out who has more apples, we need to compare their numbers directly. So, Jackie has 10 - 8 = 2 more apples than Adam. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Jackie has two more apples than Adam""."
Response:  Adam and Jackie initially had 6 apples together. Then they divided them equally among themselves, so each of them got 4 apples. So, in total, they have 20 apples (6 + 4 = 20).
Response:  If Adam and Jackie have 7 apples together, then they must have had at least one apple each before combining them. So, the number of apples Adam has is at least 1. Moreover, since they combined their apples to get 7, the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have between them is at most 7 + 1 = 8. Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If nine apples go to Adam, then how many are left for Jackie? So, Jackie has three apples (12 - 9 = 3). Now, we need to find out how many apples Adam has. Since eight apples go to Adam, he has eight apples (8). Therefore, the correct answer is:  Adam has 8 apples, and Jackie has 3 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has four apples and Jackie has ten apples. So together they have two apples (Adam + Jackie = 2). Now we are told that Adam and Jackie had two apples in common, which means they shared one apple between them. Therefore, Adam now has three apples left (3). Finally, we are asked how many apples Adam has in total. Since he started with four apples and lost one through sharing, he has three apples left, which is his final total (3). So, to summarize, Adam has three apples in total.
Response:  Adam has five apples and each apple represents one eple. So, Adam has 5 x 1 = 5 eples. Therefore, Adam does not have many more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Helen made 31 small kitchens yesterday and 270 in total. So, if we divide the number of small kitchens she made yesterday (31) by the total number of small kitchens she made (270), we get... 31 / 270 = 0.118. Therefore, Helen made approximately 11.8% of her total small kitchens yesterday.
Response:  We know that Helen made 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 51 strawberries today. So in total she has made 90 + 51 = 141 sweet treats. Now we are asked how many chocolate chip cookies had Helen baked. To find this out, we can divide the total number of sweet treats (141) by the number of days she spent preparing for Thanksgiving (2). This gives us an average of 70.5 chocolate chip cookies per day. Therefore, Helen had baked approximately 70.5 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen made 527 chocolate chip cookies and 86 rice krispy treats yesterday. Today, she is making more of both - 86 small cakes and 554 chocolate chip cookies! So in total, Helen has made 527 + 86 + 86 = 695 sweet treats today.
"Response: 
Helen made 144 chocolate and 397 rice cakes yesterday. She also baked 85 small cookies and 403 chocolate bits this morning. So in total, Helen made 626 sweets (144 + 397 + 85 + 403).  Therefore, the number of rosins Helen had made is 626 - 403 = 223."
Response:  Yesterday (yest), Helen made 19 chocolate cookies. This morning (morn), she made 231 raisin cookies. Today (day), she made 237 more chocolate cookies. So in total, Helen made 607 chocolate cookies.
"Response: 
Helen made 197 chocolate and raspberry plaques yesterday. She baked 75 small cookies today. That means she baked 122 more cookies than plaques (197 - 75 = 122). So, the number of chocolate cookies Helen had today was 122."
"Response: 
Helen made 519 chocolate and 300 rice cakes yesterday. Today, she baked 280 small cookies and 359 chocolate bites. So in total, Helen had 519 + 300 = 819 candies today."
Response:  We know that Katie scored 81 out of 100 and her friends scored 59 out of 100. To find out how many more questions Katie got right than her friends, we can subtract their score from hers: 81 - 59 = 22. So Katie answered 22 more questions correctly than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie played 91 games with her DS and her friends played 88 games with their DS. So, the total number of games played by both Katie and her friends is:  91 + 88 = 179 games. Now, we are told that some of Katie's friends were very good at playing games on their DS and they played 53 games together. Therefore, the total number of games played by all of Katie's friends including those who were not as skilled at playing games on their DS is:  179 + 53 = 232 games. So, many game players have more than Katie's friends.
Response:  Katie has 78 new and 86 old parties. Her friends have 48 new games. Can many new games have they laid together?  We can start with the number of new games that Katie has (78) and add it to the number of new games her friends have (48). So, the total number of new games is 78 + 48 = 126.
"Response: 
Katie has 84 new and 19 old slot machines. They are all unique. The friends of hers have 8 new and 69 old slot machines. Have they combined many new games?  Yes, they have combined many new games because:  New - 84 = 76 (Katie) + 8 = 84 (friends) = 150 Total new games."
Response:  Katie has 62 new and 80 old toys. Her friends have 73 new and 41 old games. So, how many old toys does Katie have? We can find this out by subtracting the number of new toys from the total number of toys she has: 62 - 80 = -18. Therefore, Katie has negative 18 old toys.
Response:  We know that Katie is 63 years old and has 57 children. Therefore, we can calculate her age at each pregnancy as follows: Age = Current age + Number of pregnancies. In this case, Katie's age at each pregnancy would be: Age = 63 + 57 = 120 years. Since Katie has more than twice as many children as Venus (Venus has 13 children), Katie must have given birth to more than twice as many babies as Venus. So, the number of times Katie gave birth is greater than or equal to 2 x 13 = 26.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new and 39 old toys in total. Her friends have 34 new toys. To find out how many more toys Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of new toys her friends have from the total number of new toys Katie has: 57 - 34 = 23. So, Katie has 23 more new toys than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $60 and Jason has $19. So, in total they have $89. Then, we are told that Jason has washed cars in holy week and earned $33. Therefore, the amount of money Jason made from washing cars is $33. So, the final answer is $89 + $33 = $122.
Response:  Fred has $86 for 7 weeks and Jason has $5 for one week. If they both have money every day, then:  Fred has $86 x 7 = $592 in total for the 7 weeks. Jason has $5 x 1 = $5 in total for the one week. So, together they have $592 + $5 = $607.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $19 for 5 weeks and then he spent $40 in total. So, his remaining amount is $19 - $40 = -$21. Now, let's consider Jason's situation. He had $16 for 5 weeks and then he spent $69 in total. So, his remaining amount is $16 - $69 = -$53. Therefore, Fred has lost more money than Jason.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $114 last week and Jason had $22 last week. Then they went to church and gave away some money. Now Fred has $21 left and Jason has $78 left. So, Jason gained $56 in one week ($78 - $22).
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 last week and Jason had $40 last year. Then, Fred washed his car in the past week and earned $115. Finally, Jason sold newspapers and made $44. So, did they make many money to wash their cars?  No, they didn't.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $49 for 5 weeks and then he washed cars in holy week and earned $112. So, his total amount of money is now $161 ( $49 + $112). Now, Jason delivered newspapers and got $63 per day. For how many days did he deliver newspapers?  Therefore, the total amount of money that Jason made from delivering newspapers is $63 x number of days = $63 x 7 = $431.  So, the difference between the two amounts is $431 - $161 = $270.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $78 in his pocket for the past 7 weeks and Jason has $31. Then, Jason sells newspapers and earns $14 more. Next, Fred washes cars over the weekend and gets $90 as payment. So, how much money do they have altogether to deliver newspapers?  We can calculate it as follows:  Fred's total amount = $78 + $90 = $168.  Jason's total amount = $31 + $14 = $45.  Therefore, together they have $168 + $45 = $213 to deliver newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $33 in his pocket for the past 3 weeks and Jason has $95. Then, Fred spent $16 on newspapers during Holy Week and $74 on car washes during Holy Week. So, if Fred wants to make money in Holy Week, he will have to spend more than $16 + $74 = $90. Therefore, the correct answer is $90.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 in his pocket for 4 weeks, which means he has $47 x 4 = $188. Then, we know that Jason had $99 in his pocket, so together they have $188 + $99 = $287. Finally, we know that Fred spent $111 dollars on gas and car wash, which means he is left with $287 - $111 = $176. Therefore, Fred has $176 in his pocket.
Response:  Firstly, Jessivek weighed 71 kg initially. Then, after starting to jog daily, she lost 20 kg. So, her new weight is... (calculate)...51 kg!
Response:  Firstly, Jessi weighed 27 kg initially. Then she started jogging every day and lost 101 kg in total. So, how much did she weigh before starting her jogging routine?  We can calculate this as follows:  Before starting jogging = Initial weight - Lost weight = 27 kg - 101 kg = -74 kg This means that Jessi weighed -74 kg before starting her jogging routine.
Response:  Before starting to jog every day, Jessie lost 126 kg. If we assume that she started with a weight of 80 kg (which is close to the average weight for an adult woman in Norway), then her weight loss would be approximately 35% of her initial weight. So, if Jessie weighed 66 kg after losing 126 kg, then her weight before starting to jog was around 49 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie started jogging every day and lost 35 kg. Before starting to jog, she was 69 kg. So, if we calculate the weight loss percentage, it would be (35/69) x 100 = 50%. Therefore, Jessie lost half of her initial body weight through jogging.
Response:  Firstly, Jessi weighed 114 kg. After starting to jog daily, she lost 50 kg in her first weight loss and 60 kg in her second weight loss. So, how much did Jessi lose in total?  We can calculate this as follows: Total weight loss = First weight loss + Second weight loss = 50 kg + 60 kg = 110 kg Therefore, Jessi lost a total of 110 kg after starting to jog daily.
"Response:  First week, Jessi lost 9 kg (kilograms) weight. In the second week, she lost an additional 62 kg - so in total, she lost 71 kg of weight during these two weeks. Now, we need to find out how much Jessi weighed before starting her jogging routine. According to the question, ""Ho byrja √• jogga dagleg gjekk"", which means ""Jessi started jogging every day"". So, let's assume that Jessi started jogging after gaining some initial weight. Let's call this initial weight as 'W'. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: W + 71 = 140 (initial weight + weight loss during first two weeks) We know that Jessi lost 71 kg of weight during the first two weeks, so if we subtract this amount from both sides of the equation, we get: W + 71 - 71 = 140 - 71 W = 79 kg This means that Jessi weighed 79 kg before starting her jogging routine."
Response:  After the first week of jogging, she lost 56 kg (123 lbs). In the second week, she lost another 99 kg (218 lbs), for a total loss of 155 kg (347 lbs) in two weeks. So, if she started at 92 kg (203 lbs), then after two weeks of jogging, her weight would be: 92 kg - 155 kg = 63 kg (139 lbs).
Response:  If there were 95 cages and 61 alligators in one building, that means there are 34 empty cages (95 - 61 = 34).  If 64 snakes were hiding, then many of them must have hidden themselves in these empty cages. So, the correct answer is 64.
"Response:  If there were 40 alligators in one of the 93 cages (or ""ormar""), then we can calculate how many other alligators there must have been in total using simple division. So if there are 93 cages and 40 alligators in one of them, then there are 93 - 40 = 53 empty cages. Therefore, there must have been 97 alligators in total (since there are 93 cages and 97 alligators mentioned in the passage)."
Response:  If there were 82 sharks and 19 alligators in one enclosure, then we can deduce that there must have been many more animals that were not present.  Therefore, the correct answer is 82 - 19 = 63.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in the enclosure. If we subtract the number of snakes (24) and alligators (51), we get: 79 - 24 - 51 = 34. So, there would be 34 animals left to hide.
Response:  If Bonde had 171 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and took out 134 today, then he has 37 tomatoes left in his garden (171 - 134 = 37). So, many tomatoes did Bonde have initially? Answer: 37
"Response:  If Ein Bonde had 160 tomatoes in his garden and he had 56 yesterday and 41 today, then we can calculate how many he had overall as follows:

Total number of tomatoes = Number of tomatoes yesterday + Number of tomatoes today
= 56 + 41
= 97

So, Ein Bonde had 97 tomatoes in his garden."
Response:  If Bonde had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and today he has 50 tons, then we can calculate how many more tomatoes he picked today compared to yesterday. So, the difference between the number of tomatoes he had yesterday and today is equal to the amount of tomatoes he picked today minus the number of tomatoes he had yesterday. Therefore, the answer is (50 - 90) = -40 tomatoes.
Response:  If Bonde has 175 tomatoes and 77 potato plants in his garden, and he picks 172 potato marrows, how many tomatoes does he have left?  We can start by subtracting the number of potato marrows he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had: 175 - 172 = 3. So, Bonde has 3 tomatoes left after picking 172 potato marrows.
Response:  If Bonde has 177 tomatoes and 12 potato bags in his garden, that means he has a total of 189 items (tomatoes + potatoes) in his garden.  If he spends half of his time farming, then he spends 94.5 minutes (half of 180 minutes) farming per day.  If he picks 53 tomatoes, it means he picked 1/3 of his total tomato crop (53 / 177 = 1/3).  Therefore, if we assume that each tomato bag contains an equal number of tomatoes as there are bags, then Bonde has 12 x 1/3 = 4 tomato bags left after picking 53 tomatoes. Similarly, if each potato bag contains an equal number of potatoes as there are bags, then Bonde has 12 x 1/3 = 4 potato bags left after picking 53 tomatoes. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Bonde has 105 green and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. They cannot switch anything with each other. So, we can conclude that they have a total of 176 tomatoes (105 + 71).
Response:  If John needs four nails to attach each large plank and he usually cuts big planks that require two spikes to be fixed to the wall, how many spikes will John need in total?  Solution: To calculate the number of spikes John needs, we can use the following formula: Number of spikes = Total number of planks / Number of planks per spike x Number of spikes required per plank. In this case, let's assume that John needs 10 large planks to cover the entire wall. Number of planks = 10. Number of planks per spike = 2 (as mentioned in the question). Therefore, Number of spikes = 10 / 2 x 2 = 8 spikes. So, John needs 8 spikes in total to fix all the planks to the wall.
Response:  We know that one large plank requires 13 nails to attach it to the wall. A small house with three wooden beams needs 17 nails to connect them together and make a solid structure. Now we have eight nails left over after building the small house. So, if John wants to build another similar-sized house, he will need 8 + 13 = 21 nails in total.
Response:  We know that John used 11 hammers to nail the walls of the house. Each hammer requires 3 nails to be nailed, so he needed 3 x 11 = 33 nails in total. Since each nail needs 2 pieces of wood (planks) to be attached, he needed 33 / 2 = 16.5 planks in total. So, John had to use at least 16.5 planks to build the wall.
"Response:  If he used 12 large and 10 small planks to build the wall, then:

* For each large plank, he needs 15 nails to secure it in place (since he said that one large plate requires 15 nails). So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 12 x 15 = 180 nails.
* For each small plank, he needs 5 nails to secure it in place (since he said that one small plank requires 5 nails). So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is 10 x 5 = 50 nails.
* In total, John needs 180 + 50 = 230 nails to build the wall."
Response:  If John used large pieces of wood (3/4 planks) and small pieces with nails for fastening, he would need twice as many nails to attach them all together. So if he needed 16 planks for the wall, he would need at least 32 nails.
Response:  If one plank requires 8 nails to be fixed, and John needs 74 nails in total to fix all the planks, then he will need 9 planks (74/8 = 9). So, John will need 9 planks to fix the walls of the house.
"Response:  We know that John used 12 large and 17 small planks to build the wall. To make one large bracket, he needs 14 nails. For each of the small brackets, he needs 25 nails. So in total, John will need:

Large bracket: 14 nails x 1 = 14 nails
Small bracket: 25 nails x 3 = 75 nails
Total number of nails needed: 14 + 75 = 89 nails
Therefore, John will need at least 89 nails to build the wall."
Response:  We know that there are currently 3 gummies left in the package and the total number of gummies is 42. So, if we divide 42 by 3, we get 14. Therefore, Robin has had 14 packages of gummies.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 pieces of chewing gum in total. Of those, 23 are left in the package, so we have 20 extra pieces (8 gumballs x 5 pieces per gumball = 40). Therefore, Robin has 63 pieces of chewing gum (43 + 20).
Response:  We know that Robin has 6 gummies and there are 7 packages of gummies in total. So, we can calculate how many gummies each package contains as follows:  Package size = Total number of gummies / Number of packages = 41 gummies / 7 packages = 5 gummies per package. Therefore, Robin had 7 packages of gummies.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of gum and 13 pieces of candy. If there are 4 pieces in each package, then we can calculate how many packages Robin has as follows: Number of pieces of gum = 28 Number of pieces of candy = 13 Total number of pieces = Number of gum + Number of candy = 28 + 13 = 41 Since there are 4 pieces in each package, we can conclude that Robin has 41 packages of gum or candy. Therefore, Robin has 41 x 4 = 164 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 pieces of gummy candy and 45 pieces of goodies in total. Since there are 9 packages in total, we can divide both numbers by 9 to find out how many pieces each package contains. So, if we divide 21 by 9, we get 2.36 (round up to 2). Similarly, if we divide 45 by 9, we also get 5 (round up to 5). Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gummy candies and 5 packages of goodies.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 pieces of gummy candy and 14 pieces of candy. There are six pieces in each individual package. So, we can calculate how many packages Robin had as follows: Number of pieces = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per package = 28 + 14 = 42 pieces of candy / 6 pieces per package = 7 packages of candy Therefore, Robin had 7 packages of candy.
Response:  If the machine can make three shirts per minute and there are six shirts left to be made, we need to calculate how many minutes it will take for the machine to finish making all of them. We know that the machine makes three shirts every minute, so in total, it will take 6/3 = 2 minutes for the machine to make all six shirts. Therefore, the answer is 2 minutes.
Response:  If the industrial machine could produce five minutes ago and it can make four shirts per minute, then in five minutes, it will have produced __________ shirts. So, the answer is 5 x 4 = 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total. If it can make 3 shirts per minute, then the time taken to make those 9 shirts is: Time = Number of shirts / Speed (shirts/minute) = 9 / 3 = 3 minutes. So, the machine took 3 minutes to make 9 shirts yesterday.
"Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in total. If it can make 8 shirts per minute, then the time taken to make those 13 shirts is:
Time = Number of shirts / Rate at which they are made per minute
= 13 / 8
= 1 hour and 42 minutes (or 96 minutes)
So, the machine worked for approximately 96 minutes yesterday."
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in total. If it can make 2 shirts per minute, then it took (9 / 2) = 4.5 minutes to make all those shirts yesterday. Now, today it made 8 shirts. So, it took (8 / 2) = 4 minutes to make those shirts today. Therefore, the machine spent a total of 4 + 4 = 8 minutes making both days' worth of shirts.
Response:  If the machine can make three shirts per minute and yesterday it made four shirts, then the total number of shirts produced in one hour is: 3 x 60 = 180 shirts.  And if today it made eight shirts, then the total number of shirts produced in two hours is: 8 x 60 = 480 shirts. So, many minutes have passed since the machine started working? The difference between the time taken to produce 480 shirts and the time taken to produce 180 shirts is 290 minutes (or 4.8 hours). Therefore, the machine has been running for an additional 4.8 hours beyond what was mentioned in the question.
Response:  If it took 12 minutes yesterday and 14 minutes today to make 6 shirts, then we can calculate how many shirts were made in total as follows: Total time = (yesterday + today) / 2 = (12 + 14) / 2 = 13 minutes Total shirts = Total time x Number of shirts/minute = 13 x 6 = 78 shirts So, the machine made 78 shirts in total.
Response:  If it took 5 minutes yesterday and 12 minutes today to make 6 shirts, then we can calculate how many shirts were made in total as follows: Total time = Number of shirts x Time per shirt Total time = 6 x (5 + 12) / 2 Total time = 6 x 17 / 2 = 34 shirts So, the machine has made 34 shirts today.
Response:  On five days, they won $165 in total. If we divide that amount by the number of days, we get: $165 / 5 = $33 per day.
"Response:  If they spent $144 per day and stayed for 22 days, then...

$$ Total amount spent = Number of days \times Daily expenses $$

So, the total amount spent would be:

$$ Total amount spent = 22 days \times $144/day = $3,088 $$

Therefore, many dollars did they spend during their stay in ""The Gathering""?

Answer: They spent $3,088."
"Response:  If they won $420 in 30 days playing the game ""Gamle Dagane,"" that means they won an average of $13.67 per day ($420 / 30 days). However, if we add the extra money they earned from the ""Old Days"" game, which is $22, then their daily earnings would be $15.83 ($13.67 + $22). So, the correct answer is $15.83."
"Response:  In the first 44 days of playing ""Ringtoss,"" they made $382 in total. And in the last 10 days, they made $374. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get: $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, they made a total of $756 during their entire time playing ""Ringtoss."""
Response:  In the first 20 days of the carnival, they earned $120. Then in the next 16 days, they earned $66. So, if we calculate the average amount earned each day during those 46 days, it would be: ($120 + $66) / 46 = $35 per day.
Response:  The first 154 days with an income of $325 in silver coins were followed by 57 days with an income of $114 in silver coins. To find out how much money was earned per day during the last 57 days, we need to divide the total amount earned during those days by the number of days. So, if we calculate this way, we get: Total amount earned = $325 + $114 = $449 Day earnings = $449 / 57 = $8.06 per day
"Response:  If Lucy bought 10 packs of small snacks and 4 packs of cakes at the shopping center, then she must have spent a total amount of money equal to the price of each pack multiplied by the number of packs she bought. So, if we assume that the price of one pack of small snacks is $5 and the price of one pack of cakes is $8, then Lucy spent a total amount of money equal to:
$$ 5 \times 10 = 50 $$ for small snacks and
$$ 8 \times 4 = 320 $$ for cakes.
Therefore, Lucy did not buy many poles (which are not mentioned in the question)."
"Response: 
Lucy bought 4 packets of snacks (22 packets in total). Then she bought 16 packets of chocolate. So, altogether Lucy bought 38 packets of food (4 + 16 = 20)."
Response:  We know that Lucy bought 23 bags of candy and some other small snacks. She also had 27 packages of food. If many packages of cake were included among these items, we can assume that there are at least as many packages of cake as there are packages of food. Therefore, the total number of packages of cake is at least 27.
"Response: 
Lucy spent $20 on sweets (2 x $10). So she has $20 - $20 = $0 left after buying sweets.
Now, let's calculate how many bags of food she bought:
She spent $10 on each bag of food, so she bought 10 / $10 = 1 bag of food.
Therefore, Lucy bought 1 bag of food."
Response:  We know that there were initially 12 people on the bus. Then, four more got off at the next stop. So, the number of people left on the bus is 12 - 4 = 8. Therefore, there are currently 8 people on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people on the bus. Then, 12 new passengers got on and 3 passengers got off, leaving us with 8 + 12 = 20 people on the bus. So, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  There were initially 13 people who got on the bus. Then there were four people in the starting position. So, in total, there are 13 + 4 = 17 people on the bus.
Response:  If there were 8 passengers at the stop and 11 people got on the train, then the total number of people on the train is 8 + 11 = 19.
Response:  If there were 22 parents at the airport and 676 students participated in the program, then we can calculate the number of students per parent as follows: Number of students = Total number of participants / Number of parents = 676 / 22 = 31.5 Students per parent. Therefore, approximately 31.5 students took part in the program for each of the 22 parents present at the airport.
Response:  There were 73 parents, and each parent had 2 children (on average). Therefore, there were 146 children from the parents. Now, let's calculate how many teachers were needed to teach all these children. Since there were 724 students in total, we can assume that each teacher taught an average of 5 students (based on the number of teachers given in the problem). So, the number of teachers required was 724 / 5 = 144.
"Response:  If there were 174 parents and 521 children who participated in the research project, then the number of times many of them saw the presentation can be calculated as follows:

Number of times many saw the presentation = Number of parents x Number of children they brought / Total number of participants
= 174 x 521 / 1235
= 690
Therefore, many of them saw the presentation approximately 690 times."
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 children who participated in the research project. To find out how many stages are needed to put up a show, we need to divide the number of children by 44. So, the answer is: 61 / 44 = 1389. Therefore, there will be 1389 stages needed to put up a show with these numbers.
Response:  If it is 90 meters deep and they must swim around 40 meters long, then... (calculate)...the distance traveled in the water would be: Distance = Speed x Time = 90 m / 2 m/s x 40 m = 3600 m. Therefore, the answer is 3600 meters.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and its width is 849 feet. If they move at a speed of 17 kilometers per hour, how long will it take them to reach the end of the cave?  Solution: To find out how long it takes for them to reach the end of the cave, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is the length of the cave (1218 feet + 849 feet) which is equal to 2067 feet. Now, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to feet per second. There are 1.60934 kilometers in one mile, so 17 kilometers per hour is equal to 17 x 1.60934 = 259.75 feet per second. Finally, we can plug these values into the equation above to get the time it takes to reach the end of the cave: Time = 2067 feet / 259.75 feet/second = approximately 8 minutes and 1 second.
"Response:  If they are at an altitude of 659 feet higher than the ground on Earth and the holes are 762 feet deep, how far away is it?

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the distance from the surface of the Earth to their current location using the formula: Distance = Height - Ground Level.
Distance = 659 ft - 0 ft (ground level) = 659 ft
2. Calculate the depth of the hole relative to their current location using the formula: Depth = Height - Current Altitude.
Depth = 762 ft - 659 ft = 83 ft
3. To find out how far away they are from the starting point, use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time + Initial Position.
Assuming they started at sea level with no initial position, we can set the speed equal to the height gained per second (assuming constant acceleration). For example, if they gain 659 feet in altitude every second, their speed would be: Speed = 659 ft/s.
Now, let's calculate the time taken to reach their current altitude: Time = Distance / Speed = 659 ft / 659 ft/s = 1 s.
Therefore, they have been climbing for one second.
Finally, we can calculate the distance traveled during that time using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time = 659 ft x 1 s = 659 ft.
Adding this distance to their initial position gives us their current position: Current Position = Initial Position + Distance = 0 ft + 659 ft = 659 ft above sea level.
4. Now, we need to subtract the depth of the hole from their current altitude to get the horizontal distance from the starting point: Horizontal Distance = Current Altitude - Depth = 659 ft - 83 ft = 576 ft.
So, they are 576 feet horizontally away from their starting point."
"Response:  If we assume that each goldfish has an average length of about 10 cm (which is a reasonable estimate), then we can calculate the total length of all eight goldfish as follows:

8 goldfish x avg. length = 8 x 10 cm = 80 cm

So, to answer the question, I would say that Paige has seen approximately 80 cm worth of goldfish in her bathtub."
Response:  We know that Paige has 7 goldfish and 12 cats in the pond, but they are all friends with those who don't have streams. She has 15 years left. How many fish has she seen?  Based on this information, we can conclude that Paige has not seen any fish because there are no fish in the pond since it only contains goldfish and cats. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond, but they were all friendly towards each other. Now, we have two left over. So, if many goldfish means more than 20, then the answer is  Yes, Paige has seen many goldfish (more than 20).
Response:  If Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond and they ate five of them, then there are 10 goldfish left in the pond. So, the answer is 10.
Response:  If the cook has made some tartlets and then he has two apples left, that means he has used __________ (2) apples.
Response:  The cook had 58 apples and after making some small cakes, he used $35 per day. So, if many apples have eggs, then... (Note: This is a playful way of saying that we don't know the exact number of apples the cook has.)
Response:  The original amount of apples was 40 and after making small balls he had 39 left. So, he used 1 apple to make those small balls.
"Response:  If Adam could fit 11 pieces of furniture in his room and there are four shelves and forty items in the room, then we can calculate how many items each shelf can hold as follows:

Number of shelves = 4
Capacity per shelf = Number of items in the room / Number of shelves
= 40 / 4
= 10

So, Adam could have seen ten items on each shelf."
Response:  If Adam could have given himself eight small prostheses on one half of his body, and they went over here (pointing to the other side), then he must have had at least two halves of his body. Therefore, the number of shelves in Adam's room is greater than or equal to 2.
Response:  If Adam could place 8 pieces of equipment with installation and 10 pieces with one gong between each quarter of the three, there are four shelves in the room. So, if many people had it together, the total number would be: 4 x 8 = 32 + 10 = 42 pieces of equipment.
Response:  We know that there are 544 potatoes in 10 bags. Each bag has 32 flowers in it. So, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total no. of flowers = Number of bags x No. of flowers per bag = 544 x 32 = 17,688 flowers. Therefore, many flowers have they together.
Response:  We know that there are 466 potatoes outside and each quarter has 53 flowers and 181 seeds in it. So, how many flowers and seeds have you got altogether?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of quarters with the number of flowers and seeds in each quarter.  Quarters x Flowers x Seeds = Total Number of Flowers and Seeds  In this case, we have:  Quarters = 466 / 4 = 116  Flowers per Quarter = 53  Seeds per Quarter = 181  Now let's calculate the total number of flowers and seeds:  Total Number of Flowers = 116 x 53 = 6,078  Total Number of Seeds = 116 x 181 = 20,966  Therefore, you have 6,078 flowers and 20,966 seeds altogether.
Response:  We know that there are 141 types of potatoes, and each type has 71 flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers is: 141 x 71 = 9671. As for the number of stalks, we are told that there are 91 stalks in every hundred pounds of potatoes. So, if we have 9671 flowers, then the total number of stalks is: 9671 / 100 = 96710.
Response:  We know that each quarter has 40 flowers and there are 4 quarters in total. Therefore, the number of flowers altogether is 4 x 40 = 160 flowers. Now we need to find out how many penises have 400 flowers together. To do this, we divide 400 by 40, which gives us an answer of 10 pensises with 40 flowers each. So, the correct answer is 10 pensises.
"Response:  We have 4502 styres and 4276 stryker in total. If we divide them into groups of 154, then the number of groups will be:

Number of groups = Total number of items / Number per group
= 4502 + 4276 / 154
= 4502 + 28
= 4784

Therefore, there are 4784 groups if we divide the 4502 styres and 4276 stryker into groups of 154 each."
Response:  We have 3941 countries in the world and Steve has 4950 strikes. If we divide them into groups of 495 each, then there will be no group left with any strike. So, the answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that there are 896 pens in Steve's collection and he also has 517 rubber bands and 90 drawers. If we divide these items into eight groups of equal size, then the number of items in each group will be:

Pens: 896 / 8 = 112 (rounded up to nearest whole number)
Rubber Bands: 517 / 8 = 64 (rounded up to nearest whole number)
Drawers: 90 / 8 = 11 (rounded up to nearest whole number)
So, if we place these items in eight groups, the number of items in each group would be:
Group 1: Pens - 112
Group 2: Rubber Bands - 64
Group 3: Drawers - 11
Note: The numbers may not be exact due to rounding up or down."
"Response:  If there are 5 students in each of the remaining classes and all students have the same number of classmates, then... (1 mark)

Instructions: Please provide your answer as a numerical value."
"Response:  If there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students, then the total number of students is:

304 classes x 75 students/class = 22,500 students

So, many of them were present at the event."
