"Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 18 children and on Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 10 children. To find out how many more children Julia had on Monday than on Tuesday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:

18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, Julia had 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 11 children and on Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 12 children. So, Julia played more children on Tuesday than on Monday. The difference between the number of children she played on Tuesday and Monday is 1 (12 - 11 = 1). Therefore, the answer to the question is 1.
Response:  We know that Julia played with 5 children on Monday and then she played with some other children on Tuesday. So, let's assume that she played with x children on Tuesday. Since she played with a total of 15 children, we can set up the equation: 5 + x = 15. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: x = 10. Therefore, Julia played with 10 children on Tuesday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with some children on Monday (Montag). The number of children she played with is given as ""einige Kinder"". Since we don't know exactly how many children this means, let's assume it could be any number between 0 and 10.
On Tuesday (Dienstag), Julia played with 14 children. So, if she played with some children on Monday, then she must have played with more than 0 but fewer than 14 children on that day. Therefore, the number of children Julia played with on Monday can be represented as x, where 0 < x < 14.
Now, we are told that Julia played with a total of 16 children. This means that the sum of the number of children she played with on both days must be equal to 16:
x + 14 = 16
Solving for x, we get:
x = 2
So, Julia played with 2 children on Monday and 14 children on Tuesday."
Response:  If Julia had played with 16 children on Monday (Montag), and she played more than that on Tuesday (Dienstag), then she must have played with fewer than 16 children on Tuesday. So, Julia played with 12 children on Tuesday.
Response:  If Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday and more than 8 children on Monday, then she must have played with at least 22 children on Monday (since 14 + 8 = 22).
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 17 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 2 children. Therefore, Julia has played with a total of 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 18 children. So, Julia played with 15 + 18 = 33 children in total on these two days.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 5 children. On Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 5 + 15 = 20 children.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 2 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 14 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 16 children. So, Julia played with 14 + 16 = 30 children in total between Tuesday and Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 9 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 7 children. So, Julia had more children to play with on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Julia had 2 more children to play with on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 2 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 8 children. So, we can see that Julia had more children to play with on Monday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is: Julia had more children to play with on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 8 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 11 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 9 children. So, we can see that Julia had more children to play with on Tuesday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is: 2 (Tuesday - Wednesday).
"Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 18 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 7 children. So, we can see that Julia played with more than 15 children only on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Julia played with more than 15 children on Monday and Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 10 children. And on Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 15 children. Therefore, Julia has played with a total of 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 7 children and on Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 13 children. So far, Julia has played with 7 + 13 = 20 children. Therefore, she has played with a total of 20 children.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 12 children and spent 6 hours playing Fang (Fragen). Therefore, she played for 6/60 = 0.1 hours per child. On Tuesday (Dienstag), Julia played with 14 children and spent 8 hours playing Fang. So, she played for 8/60 = 0.13 hours per child. In total, Julia played with 12 + 14 = 26 children and spent 34 hours playing Fang. Therefore, she played with each child for 34/26 = 0.13 hours.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and spent 19 hours playing Fang. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children and spent 18 hours playing Fang. So, Julia spent more time playing Fang with 19 children than with 18 children. Therefore, the difference in number of children is 1 (19 - 18 = 1).
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 6 children. On Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 5 children. So, Julia played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1 child.
Response:  Julia played with 18 children in total. On Monday (Montag), she played with 4 children. So, on Tuesday (Dienstag), she played with 18 - 4 = 14 children.
Response:  On Monday (Montag), Julia played with 6 children. On Wednesday (Mittwoch), she played with 4 children. So, Julia played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is 2 (6 - 4 = 2). Therefore, the answer to the question is 2.
Response:  If Bobby had initially eaten some sweets and then ate 25 more, that means he ate a total of 25 + initial amount = 43 sweets. So, the answer is 20 (initial amount).
Response:  Firstly, Bobby had 28 pieces of candy. Then he added another 42 pieces, so now he has 70 pieces (28 + 42 = 70). Additionally, he had 63 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Bobby has eaten 133 pieces of sweets (70 + 63 = 133).
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate 4 more. So, he has eaten a total of 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Additionally, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 37 + 14 = 51 pieces of sweets in total.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby had 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces, so now he has 74 pieces of candy in total (38 + 36 = 74). Now, he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate, which means that his total amount of sweets consumed is 74 + 16 = 90 pieces. So, Bobby has more sweets than chocolate. Therefore, the answer to your question is 90 - 16 = 74 pieces of sweets.
Response:  Firstly, Bobby had 20 pieces of candy. Then he ate 34 pieces, leaving him with 18 remaining. So, in total, Bobby has eaten 54 pieces of candy (20 + 34 = 54).
Response:  Bobby had initially 21 pieces of candy and he has eaten 5 pieces so far. So, he still has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had 22 pieces of candy at first and he ate some, then he has less than 22 pieces left. We know that after eating 5 more pieces, he still has 8 pieces left. So, if he had x pieces of candy at first, then he must have eaten (x - 8) pieces. Therefore, Bobby had 14 pieces of candy at first (x = 14).
Response:  Bobby had initially 19 pieces of candy. If he has eaten 2 pieces so far, then he has 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby has 17 pieces of candy still left.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 32 pieces of candy and he has eaten some, then he must have eaten at least one piece of candy less than 32 (since he cannot eat more candies than he has). So, if he has 20 pieces of candy left, he must have eaten 12 pieces of candy (32 - 12 = 20). Therefore, Bobby has eaten 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 36 pieces of candy. Then he ate 17 pieces and had 19 left (36 - 17 = 19). Later, he ate another 15 pieces, so now he has 4 pieces left (19 - 15 = 4). Therefore, Bobby has 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 30 pieces of candy and he has eaten 23 pieces so far, then he must have started with 30 - 23 = 7 pieces of candy left. So, Bobby still has 7 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 5 air balloons and Jake brought 3 air balloons to the park. To find out how many more air balloons Allan had than Jake, we need to subtract the number of air balloons Jake brought from the total number of air balloons Allan brought. So, the difference between the two numbers is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Allan had 2 more air balloons than Jake in the park.
Response:  Allan brought 2 air balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 air balloons to the park. To find out how many more air balloons Jake had than Allan, we need to subtract the number of air balloons Allan brought from the number of air balloons Jake brought. So, the answer is: Jake had 3 - 2 = 1 more air balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 2 air balloons and Jake brought 1 air balloon to the park, then together they have 3 air balloons (2 + 1 = 3). So, Jake brought 1 air balloon into the park.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jake brought 6 air balloons into the park. If Jake brought 4 more air balloons than Allan, then Allan brought x air balloons into the park. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 6 = 4 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 2. So, Allan brought 2 air balloons into the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 air balloons to the park and Jake brought more than that (i.e., 6), then Jake must have brought at least 1 additional air balloon to the park compared to Allan. So, Jake brought 6 - 5 = 1 air balloon to the park.
"Response: 
Allan brought 3 air balloons to the park and Jake brought 5 air balloons to the park. So together they had 3 + 5 = 8 air balloons at first. Then Allan bought 2 more air balloons in the park, so now he has 8 + 2 = 10 air balloons. Therefore, Allan and Jake have 10 air balloons in the park."
"Response: 
Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. So far, they have 6 balloons between them. Then, Allan bought 3 more balloons in the park, bringing his total number of balloons to 5 (2 + 3). Now, we need to find out how many balloons Jake has left after buying 3 more balloons. Jake had 4 balloons initially, plus he bought 4 more balloons in the park, so he now has 8 balloons (4 + 4). Therefore, Allan has more balloons than Jake in the park - 5 vs 8."
"Response: 
Allan brought 2 balloons to the park and then bought 3 more. So, Allan had 5 balloons (2 + 3) in total.
Jake brought 6 balloons to the park.
So, the difference between the number of balloons that Jake brought and the number of balloons that Allan had is:
6 - 5 = 1
Therefore, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan in the park."
Response:  Firstly, Allan brought 5 air balloons with him to the park and then he bought 3 more air balloons there. So, the total number of air balloons that Allan brought or purchased is 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, Allan brought 8 air balloons to the park.
"Response:  We know that Allan brought 6 air balloons and Jake brought 2 air balloons to the park. Then, Jake bought 3 more air balloons in the park. So, we have:
Allan had 6 - Jake had 2 = 4 air balloons left.
Now, let's add the number of air balloons that Jake bought:
Jake bought 3 + 2 (the ones he already had) = 5 air balloons.
So, Allan had 4 air balloons less than Jake in the park. The difference between their numbers is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  We know that Allan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 3 balloons to the park. Then, Jake bought 4 additional balloons in the park. So, we can write this as an equation: 6 + 3 = x (where x is the number of balloons Jake had more than Allan). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: x - 6 = 4. Simplifying, we get x = 8. Therefore, Jake had 8 more balloons than Allan in the park.
Response:  Firstly, Jake brought 6 air balloons to the park and then he bought 3 more air balloons there. So, finally, Jake had (6 + 3) = 9 air balloons in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 3 air balloons and 20 balls to the park. Therefore, we can write this as follows: A = 3 + 20. Similarly, we know that Jake brought 5 air balloons and 59 balls to the park. So, we can write this as follows: J = 5 + 59. Now, let's add up what both of them have: A + J = 3 + 20 + 5 + 59 = 87. Therefore, Allan and Jake had 87 air balloons in the park together.
Response:  Allan brought 7 air balloons and 5 balls to the park. Jake brought 6 air balloons and 4 balls to the park. So in total, Allan had 7 + 5 = 12 objects (air balloons), and Jake had 6 + 4 = 10 objects (air balloons). Therefore, Allan had 12 balls, and Jake had 10 balls in the park.
Response:  If Allan brought 5 air balloons and they together with Jake brought 6 more, then how many did Jake bring? So, Jake brought 6 - 5 = 1 air balloon to the park.
Response:  We know that Allan brought 2 ballons to the park and bought 3 more there. So he had a total of 5 ballons (2 + 3 = 5). Now we are asked how many ballons Jake had more than Allan. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of ballons Allan had from the number of ballons Jake had. Since Jake had 6 ballons and Allan had 5 ballons, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan (6 - 5 = 1). Therefore, Jake had one more balloon than Allan in the park.
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent learning Chinese from the time spent learning English. So, if we do this calculation, we get:
6 hours/day - 2 hours/day = 4 hours/day
Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning English from the number of hours he spends learning Chinese. So, if we subtract 6 from 7, we get -1. Therefore, Ryan spends -1 hour more learning Chinese than English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and additional hours learning Chinese, then he spends in total 3 + x hours per day on language learning, where x is the number of hours he spends learning Chinese. Since he spends 4 hours per day overall on language learning, we can set up the equation: 3 + x = 4. Solving for x, we get x = 1. So, Ryan spends 1 hour per day learning Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and additional hours learning Chinese, then he spends x hours learning Chinese if he spends y - 7 hours learning English. Since he spends more time learning English than Chinese, we can set up the equation as follows: x = y - 7. Now we know that y is equal to 10 (the number of hours he spends learning both languages combined), so we can solve for x: x = y - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning Chinese.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and some additional time learning English, then he spends x hours per day learning English. Since he spends more time learning English than Chinese, we can say that x > 5. Therefore, Ryan spends x = 7 hours per day learning English.
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 7 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend:

6 hours/day x 5 days = 30 hours learning English
7 hours/day x 5 days = 35 hours learning Chinese

Therefore, in total, Ryan will spend 30 + 35 = 65 hours learning both English and Chinese over 5 days."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend:

6 hours/day x 2 days = 12 hours learning English
5 hours/day x 2 days = 10 hours learning Chinese

So in total, Ryan will spend 22 hours (12 + 10) learning both languages."
"Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend:

5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours learning English
30 hours + 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours learning Chinese
Therefore, Ryan will spend a total of 54 hours (30 hours + 24 hours) learning both languages combined over 6 days."
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 4 x 86 = 352 hours learning English over the course of 86 days. Similarly, he will spend a total of 6 x 86 = 517 hours learning Chinese over the same period. Therefore, Ryan spends 352 hours per day learning English and 517 hours per day learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English, so he learns for a total of 144 hours (6 x 24) in one month. He also spends 7 hours per day learning Chinese, which means he learns for a total of 108 hours (7 x 15) in one month. Finally, he spends 3 hours per day learning Spanish, which means he learns for a total of 90 hours (3 x 30) in one month. Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 232 hours (144 + 108 + 90) learning all three languages together.
Response:  We know that Ryan spends 6 hours per day learning English and 3 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 x 24 = 144 hours per week and Chinese for 3 x 24 = 72 hours per week. Now we need to find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese. To do this, we subtract the number of hours he learns Chinese from the total number of hours he learns English: 144 - 72 = 72 hours. So, Ryan spends 72 hours more per week learning English than he does learning Chinese.
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and 2 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 7 + 2 = 9 hours per day.
He also spends 4 hours per day learning Spanish. So, he learns Spanish for 4 hours per day.
Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning English than he does learning Spanish. The difference between these two amounts is 9 - 4 = 5 hours per day."
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours per day learning English, so he learns for a total of 14 hours (2 x 7) per week. He also spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese and Spanish, respectively, which adds up to 35 hours (5 x 7) per week. Therefore, Ryan spends more time learning Chinese than Spanish, with a difference of 21 hours (35 - 14).
Response:  If Ryan spends 3 hours per day learning English and Chinese, then he spends 3/2 = 1.5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends 1.5 hours per day learning Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours learning English and 5 x 7 = 35 hours learning Chinese. So, in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours learning both languages.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans. Then, on Tuesday (day 2), she found 7 more bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany had 8 + 7 = 15 bags of cans on day 2. Therefore, she had more bags of cans on day 2 than she did on day 1.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany had 7 sacks of cans for recycling. If she found 12 more sacks on Tuesday (day 2), then the total number of sacks she had on Tuesday was 7 + 12 = 19 sacks.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany had 4 sacks of cans. If she found some more cans on Tuesday, then she must have had at least 4 + x sacks of cans on Tuesday, where x is the number of additional sacks she found. Since she found some more cans on Tuesday, we know that x is non-zero. So, the total number of sacks of cans Tiffany had on Tuesday is 4 + x = 6. Therefore, Tiffany had 2 sacks of cans on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany collected 3 bags of cans. Then, on Tuesday (day 2), she found 4 more bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany had 3 + 4 = 7 bags of cans. Therefore, she had 7 bags of cans on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany had 10 sacks with cans. On Tuesday (day 2), she found 3 more sacks with cans, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 sacks with cans. On Wednesday (day 3), she found 7 more sacks with cans, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 sacks with cans. Therefore, Tiffany had altogether 20 sacks with cans.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany had 8 sacks of cans. On Tuesday (day 2), she found 10 more sacks of cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 sacks of cans. On Wednesday (day 3), she found 4 more sacks of cans, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 sacks of cans. Therefore, Tiffany found 22 sacks of cans after Monday.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany had 3 sacks of cans. Then, on Tuesday (day 2), she found 7 more sacks of cans and 44 sacks of bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had 3 + 7 = 10 sacks of cans.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red pears and 16 green pears in the basket. To find out how many more red pears than green pears there are, we can subtract the number of green pears from the number of red pears:  17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red pear than green pear in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red pears and 11 green pears in the basket. So, if we divide the number of green pears (11) by the number of red pears (5), we get 2. This means that there are twice as many green pears as red pears in the basket. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  If there are 10 red apples and some green apples in the basket, then the total number of apples is 10 + x, where x is the number of green apples. Since we want to find out how many green apples are in the basket if there are 15 apples in total, we can set up the equation:  10 + x = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, there are 5 green apples in the basket.
Response:  According to the question, there are 3 red pears and some green pears in the basket. If there are more than 10 green pears than red pears in the basket, then we can say that the number of green pears is greater than or equal to 10 - 3 = 7. So, there are at least 7 green pears in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red pears, 15 yellow pears, and 8 green pears in total. So, we can write this as an equation: 7 + 15 + 8 = x, where ""x"" represents the total number of pears in the basket. Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 7 + 15 + 8 - 7 = x. Simplifying this equation gives us: 15 + 8 = x. Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 (since there are two types of pears) gives us: 7 + 4 = x. Therefore, there are altogether 11 pears in the basket (7 red + 4 yellow)."
Response:  We know that there are 7 red pears in total (red + yellow + green = total). So, if we divide the number of red pears by the total number of pears, we get:  7/X = 71/Y, where X is the number of yellow pears and Y is the number of green pears. Solving for X and Y, we find that X = 53 and Y = 28. Therefore, there are 28 more green pears than red pears in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 14 green pears in total and 6 yellow pears. So, we can write this as an equation:  14 + 6 = x, where x is the number of yellow pears. Now, we also know that there are 2 red pears in the basket. Therefore, we can subtract the number of red pears from the total number of pears to find out how many more green pears than yellow pears are in the basket: x - 2 = y, where y is the number of green pears. Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us the answer: y = 9. So, there are 9 more green pears than yellow pears in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red pears in total and 11 yellow pears in total. So, we can write this as an equation:  19 + x = 11 (where x is the number of green pears). Now, we also know that there are more red pears than green pears, so we can say that x < 19. Therefore, the answer to your question is: More red pears are in the basket than yellow pears.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 red pears in total and we want to find out how many of them are in the basket. So let's write down what we know:

* Number of red pears = 6
* Total number of pears = 6 + 90 + 16 = 112

Now we can calculate the percentage of red pears in the basket as follows:

Percentage of red pears = (Number of red pears / Total number of pears) x 100%
= (6 / 112) x 100%
= 5.45%

So there are approximately 5.45% red pears in the basket."
"Response:  We know that there are 18 red pears in total and we want to find out how many of them are in the basket. So, let's write down what we know:

* Number of red pears = 18

Now, let's move on to the yellow pears. There are 14 yellow pears in total, so we can write down:

* Number of yellow pears = 14

Finally, let's calculate the number of green pears:

* Number of green pears = Total - Red + Yellow (Since there are more green than red or yellow)
= 35 - 18 + 14
= 13

So, there are 13 green pears in the basket. Now, let's summarize our answers:

Red pears: 18
Yellow pears: 14
Green pears: 13

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Red pears: 18
Yellow pears: 14
Green pears: 13"
Response:  We know that there are 5 red pears in the basket and 6 green pears. So far, we have counted 5 + 6 = 11 pears. Now let's count the yellow pears. There are 14 yellow pears in the basket, so we add them to our total: 11 + 14 = 25 pears. Therefore, there are 25 pears in the basket, including both green and yellow ones.
Response:  There are 65 baskets with pears. Each basket has 7 red pears and 3 green pears. So, there are 65 x 7 = 455 red pears and 65 x 3 = 195 green pears in total.
Response:  There are 11 baskets with pears. Each basket has 10 red pears and 18 green pears. Therefore, there are 11 x 10 = 110 red pears and 11 x 18 = 198 green pears in total. So, altogether there are 110 + 198 = 308 pears in the baskets.
Response:  There are 6 baskets with pears. Each basket has 16 red pears and 18 green pears. So, the total number of red pears is 6 x 16 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 red pears altogether in the baskets.
Response:  There are 7 baskets with pears. Each basket has 10 red pears and 2 green pears. So, there are 7 x 10 = 70 red pears and 7 x 2 = 14 green pears. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 pears in total.
"Response:  If there are 7 total pears and each basket has either 4 red or 3 green pears, then...
Step 1: How many baskets have 4 red pears? We know that every basket has at least 4 red pears since there are 4 red pears in each basket. So, the number of baskets with 4 red pears is... (4 red pears / 1 basket =) 4 baskets.
Step 2: How many baskets have 3 green pears? Since there are 3 green pears in each basket, and we want to find out how many baskets have 3 green pears, we can multiply the number of green pears by the number of baskets... (3 green pears x 7 baskets =) 21 baskets.
Now, let's add up the number of baskets from Step 1 and Step 2... 4 + 21 = 25 baskets! Therefore, there are 25 baskets with pears."
Response:  There are 2 baskets with apples. Each basket has 4 red apples and some green apples. In total, there are 12 apples in all baskets. So, if each basket has x green apples, then the number of red apples in each basket is 4 - x. Therefore, the number of green apples in each basket is x.
Response:  If there are 16 pears in total and 13 of them are red, then the number of green pears is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. So, there are 3 green pears in the basket.
"Response:  Each basket has 19 red pears and 4 green pears. If there are 15 baskets, then...

Step-by-step solution:
Let's count the total number of pears in all the baskets:

Number of red pears = 19 x 15 = 285
Number of green pears = 4 x 15 = 60
Total number of pears = 285 + 60 = 345

Therefore, there are 345 pears in total in the 15 baskets."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 pears in total and they are equally distributed among some baskets. Since each basket has either 4 red pears or 6 green pears, we can write an equation based on this information:

Red pears: 4x + 6 = 10 (where x is the number of baskets with red pears)
Green pears: 4x = 10 (where x is the number of baskets with green pears)

Now we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find out how many baskets contain pears. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's choose the first equation:

Red pears: 4x + 6 = 10

We can subtract 6 from both sides to get rid of the green pears:

4x = 4

So, there are 4 baskets with red pears. Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  We know that there are 6 green apples in total and 2 red apples in total. So, if we divide the number of green apples by the number of red apples, we get:  6 / 2 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 4 action figures. Then he added some more, so let's say he added 3 more (just an estimate). So, in total, Jerry has 7 action figures now (4 + 3 = 7).
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, if there are now 10 action figures on the shelf, then originally Jerry had x action figures on the shelf. Since we know that x + 7 = 10, we can solve for x as follows: x = 3. Therefore, Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf initially.
Response:  Jerry had initially 4 action figures and 22 books on his shelf. Later, he added 6 more action figures to the shelf. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf is: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 9 books on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there were 12 (5 + 9) action figures and 9 books on the shelf. Therefore, there are 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. So, at this point, there were 2 + 4 = 6 action figures on the shelf. However, we are asked how many books were more than the number of action figures. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the total number of books. In this case, the total number of books was 10, so if we subtract 6 (the number of action figures), we get 10 - 6 = 4 books that were more than the number of action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry had 8 action figures and 9 books initially. Later, he added 10 more books, so the total number of books is now 19 (9 + 10). Therefore, there were altogether 19 books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf. So, at this point, there were 7 + 2 = 9 items on the shelf. Since we know that there are more books than action figures, we can conclude that there were more than 9 items on the shelf. Therefore, the number of action figures was less than 9. In other words, Jerry had 7 action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. So, he had a total of 7 items (5 + 2 = 7). Later, he added 9 more books to the shelf, so now he has a total of 16 items (7 + 9 = 16). Therefore, there are more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf. The correct answer is 16 - 5 = 11.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones. So, there were initially 8 + 4 = 12 action figures on the shelf. Then, he removed 5 old ones, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 new action figures on the shelf. Therefore, there were altogether 7 action figures on Jerry's shelf after everything was said and done.
"Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures on his shelf (the initial state). Later, he added 4 more action figures to the shelf (the new state). To find out how many action figures Jerry removed from the shelf, we need to subtract the number of new action figures (4) from the total number of action figures at the new state (6):

Number of action figures removed = 6 - 4 = 2
Therefore, Jerry removed 2 action figures from the shelf."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures. Then he added some more and removed 10 of the old ones. So, if there are now 8 action figures on his shelf, that means he has added 8 - 7 = 1 new action figure. Therefore, Jerry has added one new action figure to his collection.
Response:  Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room initially. Later, he added two more action figures and removed seven of the old ones. So, if there are ten action figures on the shelf now, that means Jerry originally had x action figures on the shelf. Since we know that x + 2 = 10 (the total number of action figures), we can solve for x as follows: x = 8. Therefore, Jerry originally had eight action figures on the shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 9 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 7 more action figures, so now he has 9 + 7 = 16 action figures. However, we are also told that Jerry has 10 books on his shelf. So, if there are as many action figures as books on his shelf, then there must be 10 action figures on his shelf too. Therefore, the correct answer is 16 - 10 = 6 action figures were added to Jerry's shelf after he already had 10 books on it.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures, so he had a total of 7 items (books + action figures) on his shelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures, so now he has a total of 9 items (books + action figures). Therefore, there are 9 - 3 = 6 action figures more than books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures, so he had a total of 10 items (books + action figures) on his shelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the collection, which means that now there are 5 action figures (including the new ones). So, if we subtract the number of action figures from the initial total number of items, we get: 10 - 5 = 5. Therefore, at the end of the story, Jerry has 5 more books than action figures on his shelf.
Response:  At first, there were only two birds sitting on the fence (V1 and V2). Then some more birds came to join them (V3, V4, V5, and V6), so initially, there were six birds in total (V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 + V6). Therefore, the number of additional birds that came to sit on the fence is equal to the original number of birds minus the initial number of birds already sitting on the fence (i.e., 6 - 2 = 4). So, four birds came to sit on the fence after the initial two birds.
Response:  At first, there were some birds sitting on the fence (not specified how many). Then, 4 more birds came and joined them. So, in total, there are now 5 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, at the beginning, there were 5 birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 46 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more birds came along. So, in total, we have:

4 + 46 = 50 birds

Therefore, there are 50 birds sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds came along. So, in total, we have:

Birds = 3 + 5 = 8
Storks = 2

Therefore, there are 8 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds came along, making it 5 birds in total. So, the number of birds is now 5, while the number of storks remains unchanged at 4. Therefore, the ratio of birds to storks is 5:4 or 10:8.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 2 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came along. So, now we have:

* Birds: 2 + 3 = 5
* Storks: 6 + 0 = 6

So, there are 6 storks more than birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 6 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more storks came along, so now we have: 4 + 6 = 10 storks sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 10 storks sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks came along. So, now we have: Birds = 3 + 6 = 9 Storks = 4 + 6 = 10 Now, there are 9 birds and 10 storks sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 6 vultures and 3 storks sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more storks came along. So, now we have:

* Vultures: 6
* Storks: 3 + 2 = 5

Therefore, there are more storks than vultures sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 4 birds and 3 storks initially sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks come along. So, in total we have: Birds = 4 + 6 = 10 storks = 3. Therefore, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds and 8 storks joined them. So, in total, we have:

Initially, 6 birds + (4 new birds + 8 storks) = 18 birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 2 birds already sitting on the fence and then we add another 5 birds and 4 storks. So in total, there are 7 birds (2 + 5) and 4 storks (4). Therefore, more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. The answer is 7 - 4 = 3.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds and 6 storks came to join them. So, in total, we have:

3 + 2 = 5 birds sitting on the fence.

Now, let's count the number of storks:

6 storks.

So, the final answer is:

5 birds > than storks (by 1)."
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came along, making it a total of 9 birds (including the original 3). So, in summary, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence, which is more than the 5 storks. Therefore, the answer is 9 - 5 = 4.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came along. So, now we have:
6 storks + 2 birds = 8 creatures sitting on the fence.
Therefore, there are more birds than storks sitting on the fence."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds sitting on the fence (Vögel). Then, 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them (Störche). So, in total, we have:

Vögel = 3
Störche = 6 + 2 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 storks more than birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the answer is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 pages more than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, the second chapter has 43 pages more than the first chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 60 pages, and the book has 93 pages in total. So, if we divide the number of pages of the entire book by the number of pages of the first chapter, we get: Number of pages of second chapter = Total number of pages / Number of pages of first chapter = 93 / 60 = 15.5 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has approximately 15.5 pages.
"Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter has pages as follows: Chapter 1 - x pages; Chapter 2 - y pages. Since there are 67 total pages in the book, we can write an equation: x + y = 67. Now, we know that the second chapter has 36 pages, so we can substitute this value into our equation: x + 36 = 67. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 31. So, the first chapter has 31 pages."
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in Chapter 1 + Number of Pages in Chapter 2 + Number of Pages in Chapter 3 Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Number of Pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 Therefore, the book has 125 pages altogether.
Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, and the second chapter has 23 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 68 pages more than the second chapter.
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write: Total pages = Number of pages in Chapter 1 + Number of pages in Chapter 2 + Number of pages in Chapter 3. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total pages = 35 + 18 + 3 = 66 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has more than 3 pages.
Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, we can write this as an equation: 53 > 21. Now, let's simplify this equation: 53 - 21 = 32. Therefore, the first chapter has more than 32 pages than the third chapter.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter. In this case, the number of pages is equal to 31 x 61 = 1861 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is 1861 pages.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 23 pages, we can say that the total number of pages is equal to twice the number of pages in one chapter plus the number of pages in another chapter. Therefore, the first chapter has 10 pages, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 pages.
Response:  The book has 2 chapters and each chapter is of equal pages. So, if the first chapter has x pages, then the second chapter will also have x pages. Since the second chapter is 68 pages long, we can write an equation as follows: x = 68. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 81 (the total number of pages in the book), which gives us x = 81/2 = 40.5. Therefore, the second chapter has 40.5 pages.
"Response:  The number of camper who went rowing in the morning is given as 62 and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is given as 39. To find out how many more camper went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the number of campers who went rowing in the morning:

62 - 39 = 23
So, 23 more camper went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  The number of camper who went rowing in the morning is given as 52 and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is given as 61. To find out how many more camper went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon: 61 - 52 = 9. Therefore, 9 more camper went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.
"Response:  We know that 15 campers went for a morning rowing session and some other campers went in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows:

Morning rowing sessions = 15
Afternoon rowing sessions = x

We are told that the total number of campers who went rowing is 32. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

15 + x = 32

Now, let's solve for 'x'. To do this, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

x = 17

So, 17 campers went for a rowing session in the afternoon."
Response:  If some campers went rowing in the morning and 7 camper went rowing in the afternoon, then we can say that there are total 60 campers who went rowing. Now, if we divide the number of campers who went rowing in the morning (x) by the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon (7), we get x/7 = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, 8 campers went rowing in the morning.
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is given as 36. In addition to these, 13 camper went rowing in the afternoon and 49 camper went rowing in the evening. Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing is equal to 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers.
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is given as 44. The number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is given as 39. And the number of campers who went rowing in the evening is given as 31. So we can write an equation based on this information: 44 + 39 = 73 (total number of campers who went rowing). Now, to find out how many more camper went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon from the total number of campers who went rowing: 73 - 39 = 34. Therefore, 34 more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is given as 53. The number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is given as 48. And the number of campers who went rowing in the evening is given as 49. To find out how many campers went rowing more in the morning than in the evening, we need to subtract the smaller value from the larger value. So, the answer is: 53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, 5 camper(s) went rowing more in the morning than in the evening.
Response:  We know that 33 campers went rowing in the morning and 34 campers went rowing in the afternoon. However, only 10 campers went rowing in the evening. So, we need to find out how many more campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the evening. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the evening from the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon: 34 - 10 = 24. Therefore, 24 campers went rowing in the afternoon more than they did in the evening.
"Response:  We know that 13 campers went rowing in the morning and 21 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, altogether, we have:

13 + 21 = 34

Therefore, 34 campers went rowing altogether."
Response:  We know that 29 campers went rowing in the morning and 66 campers went hiking. So, there are more people who went hiking than rowing in the morning. Now we need to find out how many more. To do this, we can subtract the number of campers who went rowing from the number of campers who went hiking: 66 - 29 = 37. Therefore, 37 campers went for a hike in the afternoon, while 29 campers went rowing.
Response:  The number of campers who went rowing in the morning is 41 and the number of campers who went hiking in the afternoon is 26. Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing or hiking is: 41 + 26 = 67.
Response:  We know that 46 campers went for a row in one day. In addition, we are told that 43 campers went out to row in the morning and some additional campers went out to row in the afternoon. So, if 43 campers went out to row in the morning, then there must be 3 more campers who went out to row in the afternoon (since 46 - 43 = 3). Therefore, 3 camper went out to row in the afternoon.
Response:  If Rachel has picked 4 apples from the tree and initially the tree had 7 apples, then there are now 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree. So, there are still 3 apples on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples (the initial amount). Then she picked some of them and now there are only 2 apples left on the tree. So, Rachel has picked x apples where x is the difference between the original number of apples and the current number of apples (i.e., 4 - 2 = 2). Therefore, Rachel has picked 2 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 7 ripe apples from the tree and now there are only 5 left on the tree. Of these 5, 3 are ripe and the rest (2) are not yet ripe. So, the number of unripe apples on the tree is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Rachel has picked 2 ripe apples from the tree and there are now 7 apples on the tree, then the number of ripe apples is 2 + 7 = 9. So, to begin with, the tree had 9 ripe apples.
Response:  The total number of apples that Rachel picked from her tree was 6. Now, there are 2 ripe apples and 4 immature apples on the tree. So, initially, the tree had 6 - 2 = 4 apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel has picked 3 ripe apples from the tree and now there are only 2 ripe apples left. So initially, there were 5 (3 + 2) ripe apples on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. Then, new apples grew and there are now 2 more apples on the tree. So, in total, the tree has 7 + 2 = 9 apples. Therefore, the tree started with 9 apples.
Response:  Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree, so there are now 4 - 4 = 0 apples left on the tree. Then, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so the total number of apples on the tree is now 0 + 3 = 3 apples. Therefore, there are 3 apples on Rachel's tree now.
Response:  If Rachel has picked 2 apples from one of her apple trees and now that tree has 7 apples left, then we can deduce that the original number of apples on that tree was 7 + 2 = 9. So, the original number of apples on all of Rachel's apple trees together is 52 (the total number of trees) - 9 (the number of apples picked from one tree) = 43. Therefore, the original number of apples on all of Rachel's apple trees was 43.
Response:  If Rachel has picked 8 apples from each of her 3 apple trees, then she has collected 24 apples in total (3 x 8 = 24). Now, there are still 9 apples left on all the trees, so originally there were 9 + 24 = 33 apples on all the trees combined.
Response:  If Rachel has 4 apple trees and she picked 7 apples from each tree, then she picked a total of 4 x 7 = 28 apples. However, now there are only 29 apples left on the trees, so some of the apples that Rachel picked must have been already eaten or dropped. Therefore, the number of apples Rachel actually picked is 29 - 28 = 1. So, Rachel picked 1 apple in total.
Response:  We know that Ed has 19 more murmels than Doug. So if Ed had 2 more murmels than Doug initially, then Doug must have had x murmels initially. Since Ed now has 19 more murmels than Doug, we can set up an equation as follows: Ed = Doug + 19. Subtracting the initial number of murmels Doug had from both sides gives us: Doug = x - 19. Now we are given that Doug lost some murmels on the playground, so let's subtract the number he lost (let's say y) from his original amount: Doug = x - 19 = x - y. Solving for x, we get: x = 19 + y. Therefore, Doug lost y murmels on the playground.
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more mussels than Doug and he lost 4 of them. So, Ed has 45 - 4 = 41 mussels more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 6 more mussels than Doug and he lost 7 of his mussels at the playground. So, if Ed had 22 mussels initially, then Doug must have had 15 mussels (6 + 7 = 13). Therefore, Doug has 15 mussels now.
Response:  We know that Ed had 5 more mussels than Doug and he lost 3 of his mussels at the playground. So, if Ed had 27 mussels in total, then Doug must have started with 24 mussels (5 more than Ed).
"Response:  We know that Ed had 24 more mussels than Doug. So if Ed has x mussels and Doug has y mussels, we can write an equation:
x = 24 + y
Now, we are told that Doug lost 27 mussels on the playground. So, he has y - 27 mussels left. And Ed found 9 more mussels, so he has x + 9 mussels now.
We can substitute these values in the equation:
x = 24 + (y - 27)
Simplifying the equation:
x = 24 + (-27)
x = 51
So, Ed has 51 more mussels than Doug."
Response:  We know that Ed had 29 more murmels than Doug. If Ed lost 17 of his murmels at the playground, then he has fewer murmels now than before. So, Ed has less than 46 (29 + 17) murmels now. Therefore, Ed has fewer murmels than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 19 more murmels than Doug initially. Then he lost some of them at the playground and now has 8 more than Doug. So, if we subtract the number of murmels he lost from his initial amount, we can find out how many he actually lost. Therefore, Ed lost 11 murmels (19 - 8 = 11).
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 more mussels than Doug and he lost 21 of them at the playground. So, Ed has 91 - 21 = 70 mussels left. Therefore, Ed has 70 more mussels than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed had 12 more mussels than Doug. So, if Ed has 17 mussels now and he lost 20 on the playground, then Doug must have 37 mussels now (17 - 20 = 37).
"Response:  If 408 students suggested adding potato puree and 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding potato puree = 408
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 42

So, more students (408) suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon (42). Therefore, the answer is:

More than 408 students suggested adding potato puree than the number of students who suggested adding bacon."
"Response:  If 479 students suggested adding potato puree and 489 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then we have:

Total number of students who suggested adding something = 479 + 489 = 968

Now, let's find out how many students suggested adding bacon more than those who suggested adding potato puree:

Number of students who suggested adding bacon > number of students who suggested adding potato puree =?

We can simplify this equation as follows:

(489 - 479) = 90

So, 90 students suggested adding bacon more than those who suggested adding potato puree."
Response:  According to the passage, 310 students were asked for their suggestions regarding certain food items. Among them, 185 students suggested adding potato puree, while others proposed including bacon (Speck) in the menu. So, the number of students who suggested Speck is 185/310 = 0.59 or approximately 60 students.
Response:  According to the passage, 288 students were asked to suggest certain types of food for the school menu. Of these, 264 students suggested adding bacon (Speck in German). Therefore, 14 students (288 - 264 = 14) suggested adding kartoffelpüree (potato puree) to the menu.
Response:  If 63 students more suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding bacon, then the number of students who suggested adding bacon is equal to... (do you want me to continue?)
Response:  According to the given information, there were 182 students who suggested adding potato puree and 166 students who suggested adding bacon (Speck) to the menu. So, we can say that 166 - 182 = x, where x is the number of students who suggested adding bacon. Therefore, x = 94.
Response:  The total number of scholars is given as 324 + 374 + 128 = 826. So, 826 students participated in the voting process for new food items to be added to their school meals.
Response:  The total number of students is 257. If 257 students suggested adding potato puree to the menu, then there are 257 - 120 = 137 students who did not suggest adding speck to the menu. Therefore, more students have suggested adding potato puree than those who suggested adding speck. So, the answer is 137.
Response:  The total number of students is 144 + 467 = 611. Since 79 students suggested tomatoes, we have 79 tomato votes. Now, let's count the kartoffelpüree votes: if 144 students suggested kartoffelpüree, and there are 611 students in total, then we have 144 / 611 = 23 kartoffelpüree votes. Therefore, more students suggested kartoffelpüree than those who suggested tomatoes.
Response:  The total number of students is 228 + 337 = 565. Since 23 students suggested tomatoes and 337 students suggested speck, we can say that 337 - 23 = 314 students have more suggestions for speck than those who suggested tomatoes.
Response:  According to the given information, there are 450 students in total who were asked to suggest new food items for their school menu. Out of these, 412 (or 92%) students participated in the survey and suggested different options. So, we can say that 412 students have taken part in the survey.
Response:  If 218 students suggested adding potato puree and only 351 suggested adding speck, then there are 218 + 351 = 569 students who did not suggest adding either of those items to the menu. Therefore, the number of students who suggested adding speck is 569 - 351 = 218.
Response:  The total number of students is 269 + 330 = 599. If 76 students have suggested tomatoes, then the number of students who did not suggest tomatoes is 599 - 76 = 523. Now, among those who did not suggest tomatoes, 330 students have suggested kartoffelpüree, which means that the number of students who have suggested kartoffelpüree more than twice as many as those who have suggested speck (i.e., 330 / 269 = 1.24).
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in total. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in total. To find out how many boys have more than girls, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. So, the answer is: 841 - 34 = 807. Therefore, there are 807 boys who have more than 34 girls at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls (i.e., mädchen). So, the number of boys or guys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys/guys in this school.
Response:  If there are 697 girls and 228 more than boys, then the number of boys is... (do calculation)...is 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more boys than girls in this school. So, if there are x number of boys, then there are (635 - x) number of girls. Since there are 510 more boys than girls, we can write an equation as follows: x + (635 - x) = 510. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x = 490. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 245. Therefore, there are 245 boys and 385 girls in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and 281 more than boys, then the total number of students is: 868 + (281 - 868) = 868 + (-193) = 675. So, there are 675 students in this school overall.
Response:  If there are more boys than girls, then the number of boys is greater than the number of girls. So, if we have x girls and y boys, then the total number of students is x + y. Since there are 700 students in total, we can set up the equation: x + y = 700. Now, we know that y is greater than x, so we can solve for x: x = 358. Therefore, there are 358 girls and 342 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. If we add 418 more girls to this number, we get: 706 + 418 = 1124. So, there are 1124 students in the school now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys. Then, 44 more girls joined the school. So, now we have: Total number of girls = Initial number of girls + Number of new girls = 902 + 44 = 946 girls. Therefore, there are 946 girls in the school.
"Response:  We know that there are 632 girls and 410 boys in total. Out of these, 465 girls have joined the school. So, we need to find out how many more girls than boys have enrolled in the school. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of girls - Number of boys = Difference between number of girls and boys. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of girls = 632; Number of boys = 410; Difference between number of girls and boys = 632 - 410 = 222. Therefore, there are 222 more girls than boys in the school."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls is now:

732 + 682 = 1414

Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school."
Response:  We know that initially there were 214 boys and 135 girls in the school. Then, additional 496 girls and 910 boys joined the school. So, now we have to find out how many boys are in the school. To do this, we need to add the initial number of boys with the new number of boys who joined the school: 214 + 910 = 1124 boys. Therefore, there are 1124 boys in the school currently.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. If we add these numbers together, we get 626 students in total (308 + 318 = 626). Additionally, we know that there are 36 teachers in the school. So, if we divide the number of students by the number of teachers, we can find out how many students each teacher teaches. To do this, we can use division: 626 / 36 = 17.5 students per teacher. Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 students per teacher in this school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are in the school overall. There are 772 teachers, so the total number of people in the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396. Therefore, there are 1396 persons in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So, if there are x boys, then there are x + 402 girls. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x + 402) = 739. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 337. So, there are 337 boys in this school.
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys at school. So if there are x boys, then there are x + 458 girls. Therefore, the total number of students is equal to x + 458. Since there are 692 students altogether, we can set up the equation: x + 458 = 692. Solving for x gives us x = 374. So, there are 374 boys and 374 + 458 = 832 girls in this school.
Response:  We know that initially there are 362 boys and 257 girls in the school. Then, another 403 girls join the school. So, now we have: Total number of students = 362 + 403 = 765. Now, let's calculate the ratio of boys to girls: Number of boys / Number of girls = 362 / 765 = 0.48 or 48%. Therefore, there are 48% more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and spent $16. So he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edward has $2 now.  
Response:  Edward had $13 and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, Edward spent $10 ($13 - $3).
Response:  Before he spent money, Edward had $9. Then he spent $8 and now has $17. So, before he spent any money, Edward had $9 - $8 = $1.
Response:  Before he spent money, Ed had $16 + x = 108 (since he has $108 after buying books). So, x = $6.
Response:  We know that Edward spent $6 to buy two books. So he has $6 - 2 = $4 left after buying the books. Now we are told that he has $12 in total. Therefore, the cost of each book is $12 / 2 = $6.
"Response:  Before Edwar... (read more)

Question: Edward hat $6 für Bücher und $16 für Stifte ausgegeben. Jetzt hat er $19. Wie viel hatte Edward, bevor er sein Geld ausgegeben hat?
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step. Before Edward spent his money, he had $X. After spending $6 for books and $16 for stamps, he had $X + $6 + $16 = $28. Now, he has $19, so we can set up an equation: $X + $6 + $16 = $28 → X = $13. Therefore, Edward had $13 before he spent his money."
Response:  Edward has spent $4 for books and $3 for pens, so he has spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7. Now, he has $12 in his pocket, which is more than $7, so he must have received some money as well. Therefore, the correct answer is that Edward has spent $7 for books and pens.
Response:  We know that Edward has spent $16 for books and $8 for pens. So, he now has $19. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had: $19 - $8 = $11. Therefore, Edward has spent $11 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Before Ed gave away $10, he had $17 - $10 = $7. So, before he spent his money, he had $7.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 44 push-ups and David has done more than him. So, if we assume that David did x push-ups, then we can write an equation as follows: 44 + x = 102 (since David has 58 more than Zachary). Now solve for x using basic arithmetic.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 sit-ups and David has done 44 sit-ups. To find out how many more sit-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of sit-ups David did from the number of sit-ups Zachary did:  51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary has done 7 more sit-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David has made 44 push-ups today and he had 9 more than Zachary. So, if David made 44 push-ups, then Zachary must have made 35 push-ups (44 - 9 = 35).
Response:  We know that David has made 51 push-ups today and he had 49 more than Zachary. So, if we add both numbers together, we get... (insert your calculation here)
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 59 Liegestütze and 44 Crunches. If we subtract 27 from 44, we get 17. So, David has done 17 Crunches. Now, let's check if this is correct by comparing it to what the question states. According to the question, David has 19 more Liegestütze than Zachary. This means that David has done 59 + 19 = 78 Liegestütze in total. Therefore, our answer is 78.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 44 Liegestütze and 17 Crunches. David has 29 more Liegestütze than Zachary, so David has done 44 + 29 = 73 Liegestütze. However, David has also done 13 fewer Crunches than Zachary, so David has done 17 - 13 = 4 Crunches. Therefore, David has done 73 Liegestütze and 4 Crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 Liegestütze and 14 Crunches. David has done 17 more Liegestütze than Zachary, which means he has done 53 + 17 = 70 Liegestütze. However, David has also done 10 fewer Crunches than Zachary, which means he has done 14 - 10 = 4 Crunches. So, Zachary has done 53 Liegestütze and 4 Crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 35 Liegestütze and 3 Crunches. David has done 58 more Liegestütze than Zachary, which means he has done 58 + 35 = 93 Liegestütze. However, David has also done 87 fewer Crunches than Zachary, which means he has done 3 - 87 = -84 Crunches. So, Zachary has made more Liegestütze than Crunches. The difference between the number of Liegestütze and Crunches is 93 - (-84) = 137. Therefore, Zachary has made 137 more Liegestütze than Crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 46 Liegestütze and 58 Crunches. David has done 38 more Liegestütze than Zachary, so David has done 104 Liegestütze (46 + 38 = 104). However, David has also done 62 fewer Crunches than Zachary, so David has done 96 Crunches (58 - 62 = 96). Therefore, Zachary has done 96 - 104 = -8 more Crunches than Liegestütze. So, Zachary has done 78 Crunches less than he has done Liegestütze.
Response:  We know that Zachary made 19 Liegestütze and David has more than Zachary. So, David must have made at least 19 + 3 = 22 Liegestütze. But we also know that John had fewer Liegestütze than David. Therefore, David must have made exactly 22 - 13 = 9 Liegestütze.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 51 push-ups today in gym class. David did more than Zachary, so he must have done at least 51 + 22 = 73 push-ups. Since John had fewer push-ups than David, he must have done less than 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups during gym class today.
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 15 push-ups today in gym class. David did more than Zachary and had 39 push-ups. So, David is at least 24 push-ups ahead of Zachary (39 - 15 = 24). Now we know that John did fewer push-ups than David and had 9 less push-ups than David. Therefore, John did 24 / 2 = 12 push-ups fewer than David. And since John did fewer push-ups than Zachary, Zachary must have done more push-ups than John. The final calculation shows that Zachary did 15 + 12 = 27 push-ups more than John!
Response:  If David has done 30 more sit-ups than Zachary, and David did 37 sit-ups in total, then Zachary did 37 - 30 = 7 sit-ups in total.
Response:  If David has made 56 more sit-ups than Zachary, and David made 38 sit-ups, then Zachary must have made 18 less sit-ups than David (56 - 38 = 18). So, David and Zachary together have made 74 sit-ups (David: 38 + Zachary: 18).
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 34 Liegestütze and 62 Sit-Ups. If David did 40 more Liegestütze than Zachary, then he must have done 40 + 34 = 74 Liegestütze. However, we also know that David did 17 fewer Sit-Ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 62 Sit-Ups, then David did 62 - 17 = 45 Sit-Ups. Therefore, David did 45 Sit-Ups.
Response:  According to the question, David has done 36 more push-ups than he did yesterday and 33 fewer sit-ups than Zachary. So if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 sit-ups, then Zachary must have done 21 more push-ups than sit-ups (58 - 33 = 25).
Response:  If Zachary has done 5 Liegestütze and 17 Sit-Ups, then he has done a total of 5 + 17 = 22 exercises. Since David has done 27 Liegestütze more than Zachary, that means David has done 27 - 22 = 5 more Sit-Ups than Zachary. So, Zachary has done 5 more Sit-Ups than Liegestütze.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, Rachel had more than 5 pages of math homework (the number given in the question). So, the answer is 7 - 5 = 2 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. So, the total number of pages she had to complete is 3 + 4 = 7 pages. Therefore, Rachel had more than 7 pages of reading homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel had to do 5 pages of math homework and more than 7 pages of reading comprehension homework, then she must have done at least 7 + x pages of reading comprehension homework, where x is the number of pages that are more than 7 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: 7 + x = 5 + y, where y is the number of pages of math homework. Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation: x = y - 7. Therefore, Rachel had to do at least 7 + (y - 7) pages of reading comprehension homework.
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 7 pages of math homework and she did 4 more pages than reading homework, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many pages of reading homework Rachel had to do. Since she did 4 more pages than reading homework, we can say that the number of pages of reading homework is equal to 7 - 4 = 3 pages.

So, Rachel had to do 3 pages of reading homework."
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 8 pages of math homework and she did 3 more pages than reading comprehension homework, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages for math homework.
Rachel had to do 8 pages of math homework.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the number of pages for math homework and reading comprehension homework.
Math homework - Reading comprehension homework = x (where x is the unknown quantity)
x = 8 - 3 = 5

Therefore, Rachel had to do 5 pages of reading comprehension homework in addition to the 8 pages of math homework, making a total of 13 pages (8 + 5)."
Response:  If Rachel had to do 8 pages of math homework and she did 6 pages more reading than math homework, then she had to do 14 pages (8 + 6) of reading homework. So, Rachel had to do 14 pages of reading homework.
"Response:  If Rachel had to do 10 pages of math homework and she did 3 more pages of reading comprehension than math homework, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Rachel had to do for math homework.
Math homework = 10 pages

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Rachel did for reading comprehension.
Reading comprehension = 3 pages (more than math homework)

Step 3: Add the number of pages Rachel had to do for math homework and the number of pages she did for reading comprehension.
Total pages = Math homework + Reading comprehension
= 10 + 3
= 13 pages

Therefore, Rachel had to do 13 pages in total."
"Response: 
Rachel must complete 2 pages of math homework, which means she has to solve 4 problems (since each page usually contains 2 problems). So, she needs to spend time solving 4 math problems.
Next, she must complete 3 pages of reading comprehension, which means she has to read and understand 9 passages (again, since each page usually contains 3 passages). This will take her around 9 minutes to finish.
Finally, she must complete 10 pages of biology homework, which means she has to write down answers for 50 questions (since each page usually contains 5 questions). This will take her around 50 minutes to finish.
So, in total, Rachel must spend around 9 + 9 + 50 = 78 minutes completing all three types of homework."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. In addition, she had to complete 96 pages of biology homework. So, in total, Rachel had to complete 100 pages of homework (9 + 2 + 96). Therefore, the answer is 100 - 2 = 98 pages of math homework more than reading homework.
"Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Additionally, she had to do 3 more pages of biology homework than math homework. So, if we let ""M"" represent the number of pages of math homework and ""B"" represent the number of pages of biology homework, we can write the equation:

M = 11
B = M + 3

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (M and B). Can you solve for M and B using algebraic methods?"
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework, which means she had 7 x 4 = 28 pages of total homework. Then, we are told that she had more than 8 pages of biology homework, but less than 11 pages of reading homework. So, let's assume that she had exactly 9 pages of reading homework (since 11 - 8 = 3, and 3 is not a whole number). Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of reading homework and biology homework is 9 - 8 = 1 page.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she had to complete a total of 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework in these subjects. However, there is no mention of how many pages she had to complete for biology, so we cannot calculate that part. So, the final answer is 20 pages of homework in math and reading comprehension.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to do 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she had to do a total of 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework. However, we are also given that she had to do 3 pages of biology homework, so in addition to the 15 pages of homework from the previous calculation, she had to do an additional 3 pages, for a total of 18 pages of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 10 pages of reading comprehension tasks and 6 additional pages of biology assignments. Therefore, she needed to complete a total of 10 + 6 = 16 pages of work.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension tasks and 4 pages of math problems. So, the total number of pages she had to complete is 2 + 4 = 6 pages. Therefore, Rachel had more than 6 pages of math homework than reading comprehension homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension tasks and 7 pages of math homework. To find out how many pages of math homework Rachel had more than reading comprehension tasks, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading comprehension tasks from the total number of pages of homework. So, if we subtract 4 from 7, we get 3. Therefore, Rachel had 3 pages of math homework more than reading comprehension tasks.
"Response:  According to the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. So, we can write this as follows:

Morning: 6 emails
Afternoon: 2 emails

Now, let's compare these two quantities:

6 > 2 (greater than)

Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  On Monday morning (morning), Jack received 6 emails. On Monday afternoon (afternoon), he received 8 more emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  If Jack has received 4 emails in the morning and he still receives some more in the afternoon, then he must have received at least 1 email in the afternoon. So, the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon is 1.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails. In the afternoon, he received 3 more emails. Finally, in the evening, he received another 5 emails. Therefore, Jack has received a total of 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails that day.
"Response: 
Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, he received a total of 13 emails that day (5 + 8 = 13)."
"Response: 
Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon).
He also received 8 emails in the evening, so the total number of emails Jack received is:
9 + 8 = 17 emails."
"Response: 
Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening. So, he has received a total of 3 + 8 = 11 emails."
"Response: 
Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the afternoon. So he received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the morning is greater than the number of emails he received in the afternoon.
So, the answer to your question is: More than 7."
"Response: 
Jack received 9 emails in the morning and 10 emails in the afternoon, so he has received a total of 9 + 10 = 19 emails.
He also received 7 emails in the evening, so he has received a total of 19 + 7 = 26 emails.
Therefore, Jack has received more emails in the morning than in the evening."
"Response: 
Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon. So he received a total of 10 + 5 = 15 emails during the daytime.
He received 4 emails in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails he received in the afternoon and the number of emails he received in the evening is:
15 - 4 = 11 emails.
So, Jack received more emails in the afternoon than in the evening."
Response:  We know that Jack has received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. So, he has received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails. Therefore, Jack has received 9 emails in total on this day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. So far, he has received a total of 3 + 64 = 67 messages. Then in the afternoon, he received 5 emails and 54 letters. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received that day is 67 + 5 = 72 emails.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. So far, he has received a total of 5 + 6 = 11 messages. Then in the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters. Therefore, the total number of messages Jack received that day is 11 + 9 + 7 = 27 messages.
"Response: 
Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. This means he received a total of 22 messages (10 + 12 = 22).
In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So, he received a total of 47 messages (3 + 44 = 47) in the afternoon.
Therefore, Jack received more emails in the morning than in the afternoon (22 - 47 = -25)."
"Response: 
Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. This means he received a total of 14 messages (6 + 8 = 14).
In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters. So he received a total of 9 messages (2 + 7 = 9) in the afternoon.
Therefore, Jack had more letters than emails in the morning. The difference between the number of letters he received in the morning and the number of letters he received in the afternoon is:
14 - 9 = 5
So, Jack had 5 more letters in the morning than he did in the afternoon."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Jack received 6 emails in the morning and sent 91 letters. In addition, he received 2 emails in the afternoon and sent 74 letters. Therefore, we can calculate that Jack has received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails throughout the day.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So he has sent 4 + 2 = 6 emails in total that day. Then, in the afternoon, he received 6 emails and sent 8 letters. Therefore, Jack has sent a total of 6 + 8 = 14 emails that day.
Response:  If Jack has received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he must have received X emails in the afternoon. Since we know that the total number of emails he received is 9, we can set up the equation: 7 + X = 9. Solving for X, we get: X = 2. So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning. So, he has more emails in the morning than in the afternoon. Therefore, we can say that the number of emails Jack received in the morning is greater than the number of emails he received in the afternoon. However, we don't know exactly how many more emails he received in the morning compared to the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack has received 3 emails in the afternoon and he has also received 6 emails in the morning. So, the total number of emails he has received is 3 + 6 = 9. Therefore, Jack has received 9 emails in total.
Response:  The frogs jumped 12 inches and the crickets jumped 9 inches. To find out how much further the frog jumped than the cricket, we need to subtract the distance that the cricket jumped from the distance that the frog jumped. So, the difference between their jumps is: 12 - 9 = 3 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the cricket.
Response:  The total distance that both the grasshopper and frog have jumped is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. So, in this case, it would be 31 + 35 = 66 inches or 5 feet 6 inches (approximately). Therefore, they have altogether sprung 5 feet 6 inches.
Response:  The Heushrecke jumped 36 inches (Zoll). Then, the frog jumped x inches further than the Heushrecke. So, the distance the frog jumped is equal to 36 + x. Since the mouse jumped 15 inches less than the frog, the distance the mouse jumped is equal to 36 + x - 15 = 51 inches. Therefore, the frogs jumped 51 inches.
Response:  The Grashüpfer jumped 25 inches (Zoll). Then, the Frog jumped x inches further than the Grashüpfer, so it jumped 25 + x inches. Finally, the Mouse jumped y inches further than the Frog, so it jumped 25 + x + y inches. Therefore, the Mouse jumped 25 + 18 + 2 = 45 inches.
Response:  The Grashüpfer jumped 19 inches (Zoll). Then, the Frog jumped x inches further than the Grashüpfer, so it was 19 + x = 39 inches. Finally, the Mouse jumped 20 inches further than the Frog, so it was 39 + 20 = 59 inches that the Mouse jumped. Therefore, the Mouse jumped 59 - 19 = 40 inches more than the Grashüpfer.
"Response:  We know that the Grashüpfer jumped 19 inches (Zoll). The Frosch jumped x inches further than the Grashüpfer. So, the distance the Frosch jumped is equal to the distance the Grashüpfer jumped plus the difference between how far the Frosch jumped and how far the Maus jumped. In other words, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 19 + (39 - 94)
Simplifying this equation gives us:
x = 56
So, the Frosch jumped 56 inches (or 142 cm) farther than the Grashüpfer."
Response:  The Grashüpfer jumped 25 inches (Zoll). Since the frog jumped further than the grasshopper, the frog jumped 32 - 25 = 8 inches farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, the mouse jumped 26 - 8 = 18 inches less than the frog. So, the mouse jumped 18 inches or 45.7 cm.
Response:  The Heushrecke jumped 24 inches (Zoll), which is equal to 60 cm. Then, the frog jumped 33 inches further than the cricket, so it was 97 cm + 24 = 121 cm. Finally, the mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so its distance was 121 - 5 = 116 cm. Therefore, the mouse jumped 116 cm farther than the cricket.
Response:  The heushreak sprang 13 inches and then 2 inches further than the frog. So the total distance the heushreak jumped is 15 inches (13 + 2). Since the frogs jump was shorter than the cricket's initial jump of 13 inches, we can conclude that the frog jumped 9 inches (13 - 4 = 9). Therefore, the frog jumped 9 inches.
Response:  The total distance that both the grasshopper and frog have jumped is equal to the difference between their jumps plus the initial distance of the grasshopper. So, if the grasshopper jumped 35 inches and the frog jumped 4 inches further than the grasshopper, then the total distance they have jumped together would be: Total Distance = Grasshopper Jump + Frog Jump - Frog Jump (Grasshopper) = 35 + 4 - 4 = 41 inches. Therefore, the answer is 41 inches.
Response:  We know that the Grasshopper jumped 19 inches and then jumped 4 inches further than the Frog. So, the Grasshopper jumped a total of 23 inches (19 + 4). Now, we also know that the Mouse jumped 44 inches less than the Frog. Therefore, the Frog jumped 67 inches (23 - 44).
Response:  According to the problem statement, the Grasshopper jumped 39 inches and then jumped again, which resulted in him being 19 inches ahead of the Frog. So, the distance traveled by the Grasshopper is 39 + 19 = 58 inches. Now, we are told that the Mouse jumped less than the Frog, so its distance traveled would be equal to the difference between the Frog's distance and the total distance traveled by all three animals together. Therefore, the distance traveled by the Mouse can be calculated as follows: Total Distance = 58 inches (Grasshopper) + 36 inches (Frog) = 94 inches. Since the Mouse jumped less than the Frog, its distance traveled would be equal to the difference between the total distance and the Frog's distance, i.e., 94 - 36 = 58 inches. So, the Mouse jumped 58 inches.
Response:  The Grashüpfer jumped 21 inches and then jumped again to reach 25 inches beyond the frog. So, in total, he jumped 46 inches (21 + 25). Now, we know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog. Therefore, the distance between the Grashüpfer and the mouse is equal to the difference between their jumps minus the mouse's jump. In other words, it is 46 - 16 = 30 inches. So, the Grashüpfer jumped 30 inches further than the mouse.
Response:  The frogs jumped 39 inches and the crickets jumped 17 inches. To find out how much further the frog jumped than the cricket, we need to subtract the distance that the cricket jumped from the distance that the frog jumped. So, the difference between their jumps is 39 - 17 = 22 inches. Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the cricket.
Response:  We know that the mouse jumped less than the frog and more than the grasshopper. So if the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, then the mouse jumped x - 3 = 6 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 6 inches.
Response:  The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog who jumped 37 inches further than the grasshopper. So if the grasshopper jumped 14 inches, then the mouse jumped 16 - 14 = 2 inches less than the grasshopper. Therefore, the mouse jumped 14 + 2 = 16 inches.
Response:  If Mary has already added 5 tbsp of flour and the recipe requires 14 tbsp, then she needs to add another 9 tbsp (14 - 5 = 9) more flour. Now, if the recipe also calls for 6 tbsp of sugar, and Mary has already added 5 tbsp, then she needs to add an additional 1 tbsp (6 - 5 = 1) more sugar. So, in total, Mary needs to add 9 + 1 = 10 more tbsp of ingredients than what the recipe originally called for.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tbsp of flour and 11 tbsp of sugar. Since Mary has already added 4 tbsp of flour, she needs to add 5 more tbsp of flour (9 - 4 = 5). Now, we need to find out how many tbsp of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we divide the total amount of sugar required by the amount of flour she has already added: 11 tbsp / 4 tbsp = 2 + 1/2 tbsp. So, Mary needs to add 3 tbsp of sugar (2 + 1/2 tbsp) more than the amount of flour she has already added.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Mary has already added some meal to the mixture and needs more than she has. So let's start with how much meal is needed. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour, but Mary only has 4 cups (she added some). To find out how many more cups are needed, we can subtract the amount she has from what is required: 6 - 4 = 2 cups. Now that we know how many more cups of flour are needed, we need to convert this quantity into grams. One cup of all-purpose flour weighs approximately 100 grams, so 2 cups would be 2 x 100 = 200 grams. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 200 grams of flour.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Mary needs 11 tbsp of flour and she has already added some flour. If she still needs 2 more tbsp than the amount of sugar, then the total amount of flour she has added is equal to the number of tbsp needed minus the number of tbsp she has already added. So, in this case, if she needs 11 tbsp of flour and she has already added 3 tbsp (since she has 7 tbsp of sugar), then she must have added 8 tbsp of flour more (11 - 3 = 8). Therefore, Mary has added 8 tbsp of flour more than she needed.
Response:  The recipe requires 11 tbsp of sugar and some more tbsp of flour. Mary has already added 3 tbsp of flour. So, the total amount of flour needed is 11 - 3 = 8 tbsp. Therefore, the recipe required 8 tbsp of flour in total.
Response:  The recipe requires 12 tbsp of flour and 5 tbsp of sugar. If Mary has already added some flour (but we don't know how much), then she needs to add 7 more tbsp of flour (since 12 - 5 = 7). So, Mary has added 7 tbsp of flour so far.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tbsp of flour and we have already added 3 tbsp. So, to find out how many more tbsp we need to add, we can subtract the amount we have from what is required: 9 - 3 = 6. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 additional tbsp of flour.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 5 tbsp of flour and 14 tbsp of sugar. Since Mary has already added 10 tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp of sugar, we need to find out how many more tbsp she needs to add. So, we can calculate it as follows:

Required flour - actual flour = 5 - 10 = -5 tbsp
Required sugar - actual sugar = 14 - 2 = 12 tbsp
Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 tbsp of flour and 12 tbsp of sugar to complete the recipe."
Response:  The recipe requires 12 tbsp of flour and Mary has already added 11 tbsp. So we need to find out how many more tbsp she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount required (12) by the amount she has already added (11): 12 / 11 = 1.09 tbsp. Therefore, Mary needs to add approximately 1.09 tbsp of flour more.
Response:  We know that the recipe requires 10 tbsp of flour and we have already added 7 tbsp. So, to get more than 10 tbsp of flour than sugar, we need to add 3 more tbsp of flour (since 10 - 7 = 3). Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more tbsp of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tablespoons of flour to the recipe, which means she needs to add 10 more tablespoons (12 - 2 = 10) of flour to complete the recipe. However, we also know that the recipe calls for 12 tablespoons of salt, so Mary must now add 8 tablespoons (12 - 10 = 8) of salt to her mixture instead of flour. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 tablespoons of salt.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 5 tbsp of flour to the recipe, which means she still needs to add 1 tbsp of flour (since the recipe calls for 6 tbsp). Now, we need to calculate how much sugar and salt are left in the recipe after adding the 5 tbsp of flour. The recipe calls for 8 tbsp of sugar and 7 tbsp of salt. Since Mary has already added 5 tbsp of flour, this means she can now add 3 tbsp of sugar (since there are 8 - 5 = 3 tbsp of sugar remaining) and 4 tbsp of salt (since there are 7 - 5 = 2 tbsp of salt remaining). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 tbsp of sugar and 4 tbsp of salt to the recipe.
Response:  The recipe requires 13 tbsp of sugar and Mary has already added 2 tbsp. So, she needs to add another 11 tbsp (13 - 2 = 11) of sugar.
Response:  If we have already added 4 tablespoons of sugar (T = 4), and the recipe requires 6 tablespoons of sugar, then we need to add another 2 tablespoons of sugar (T = 6 - 4 = 2). Now, if we subtract the amount of sugar that has been added so far from the total amount required, we get the remaining amount of sugar needed: T = 6 - 4 = 2. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 tablespoons of sugar to the mixture.  
Response:  The recipe requires 6 t of sugar and 9 t of flour. If she has already added 2 t of flour, then we need to subtract that from the total amount required. So, now she needs to add (9 - 2) = 7 t of flour more than the sugar.
Response:  If Mary has already added 11 tbsp of flour (which is equal to 110 grams), and the recipe requires 14 tbsp of flour, then she needs to add 3 more tbsp of flour (or 30 grams). Now, if we subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount required, we get 3 tbsp of flour left to be added (or 30 grams). Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 tbsp of sugar (or 30 grams) to complete the recipe.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Mary needs 10 tbsp of flour and 3 tbsp of sugar for making the cake. She has already added some flour but doesn't have enough sugar. So she needs 7 tbsp more of flour than sugar. Therefore, Mary has added 7 tbsp of meal.
Response:  The recipe requires 13 tbsp of flour and Mary has already added some flour. To find out how many tbsp she has added, we can divide the amount of flour she needs (13) by the amount of flour she has (already added). So, if she needs 13 tbsp of flour and she has already added x tbsp, then x = 13 - (amount of flour needed). In this case, x = 12 - 13 = -1 tbsp. Therefore, Mary has not added any flour yet.
Response:  The recipe requires 14 tbsp of flour and we have already added 7 tbsp. So, to make the full amount of flour required in the recipe, Mary needs to add an additional 7 + 7 = 14 tbsp of flour.
Response:  The recipe requires 9 tbsp of flour and 11 tbsp of sugar. Since Mary has already added 12 tbsp of flour and 10 tbsp of sugar, she needs to add 3 more tbsp of sugar (since 11 - 10 = 1). So, Mary needs to add 3 more tbsp of sugar.
Response:  The recipe requires 10 tanks of meal and we know that Mary has already added 6 tanks. So, she needs to add another 4 tanks of meal (10 - 6 = 4).
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 9 tbsp of sugar and we have already added 4 tbsp of flour. So, to find out how many more tbsp of flour we need to add, we can subtract the amount of flour we have already added from the total amount of flour required:

9 tbsp - 4 tbsp = 5 tbsp

So, we need to add an additional 5 tbsp of flour to the mixture."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 2 tbsp of flour (Tasse = 160g) to the recipe, which means she still needs to add 5 tbsp of flour (since the total amount of flour needed is 9 - 2 = 7 tbsp). However, we also know that there are 4 tbsp of salt in the recipe, so Mary now needs to add an additional 3 tbsp of flour (to make up for the salt). Therefore, the final amount of flour Mary needs to add is 5 + 3 = 8 tbsp or 120g.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 12 tbsp of flour (which is equal to 12/5 = 2.4 tbsp) and the recipe requires 6 tbsp of flour. So, she needs to add another 3.6 tbsp of flour (6 - 2.4 = 3.6). Now, let's calculate how many tbsp of sugar she needs to add based on the ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe. The recipe calls for 11 tbsp of sugar per 5 tbsp of flour, so we can divide 11 by 5 to get the number of tbsp of sugar needed: 11 / 5 = 2.2 tbsp. Since Mary has already added 12 tbsp of flour, she only needs to add an additional 0.8 tbsp of sugar (2.2 - 1.4 = 0.8). Therefore, Mary needs to add 0.8 tbsp of sugar more than salt.
Response:  The recipe requires 7 tanks of sugar and 10 tanks of flour. If she has already added 4 tanks of sugar, then we need to add 3 more tanks (7 - 4 = 3). So, she needs to add 3 more tanks of sugar.
Response:  If we have already added 10 tbsp of sugar and now we need to add more meal than sugar, then we must subtract 10 tbsp from the total amount of meal required in the recipe. So, if the recipe requires 12 tbsp of meal and we have already added 10 tbsp of sugar, then we must subtract 10 tbsp from 12 tbsp to get the remaining amount of meal needed, which is 2 tbsp (12 - 10 = 2). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 2 tbsp of meal to the mixture besides the 10 tbsp of sugar she has already added.
Response:  We know that there are 19 bird families living near the mountain and that 60 of them have migrated for winter. So, if we subtract the number of birds that left (60) from the total number of bird families (19), we get the remaining bird families: 19 - 60 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 bird families more than those who returned than those who went away during the winter migration.
Response:  If there are 87 bird families living near the mountain and 7 of them migrate for winter, then the number of bird families remaining behind is equal to 87 minus 7 = 80. Therefore, 80 bird families remain in the area during winter.
Response:  We know that 20 bird families have left for warmer climates and only 14 bird families remained near the mountain. So, if we subtract 20 from 34 (the total number of bird families mentioned in the passage), we get 14. Therefore, there were initially 14 bird families living near the mountain before they started migrating for winter.
"Response:  We know that 23 bird families have migrated to Africa and 37 bird families have migrated to Asia. So, we need to find out how many bird families are left near the mountain. To do this, we can use the information given in the question: ""In the vicinity of the mountain, there are 85 bird families."" Now, let's divide the number of bird families remaining near the mountain by the total number of bird families that have migrated: 85 / (23 + 37) = 41. Therefore, there are 41 bird families still near the mountain."
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain and 42 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa is equal to 8 + 42 = 50. Now, we need to find out how many bird families have migrated to Asia. According to the question, 31 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that have migrated to Africa and those that have migrated to Asia is: 50 - 31 = 19.
"Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families near the mountain and 47 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families that have not migrated is:
$$ \boxed{38 - 47 = 9} $$
Now, we also know that 94 bird families have migrated to Asia. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that have migrated to Asia and those that have migrated to Africa is:
$$ \boxed{94 - 47 = 47} $$
So, more birds have migrated to Asia than to Africa."
"Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and 38 of them have migrated to Africa. So, the number of bird families left near the mountain is:

18 - 38 = 20

Now we are told that 80 bird families have migrated to Asia. So, the total number of bird families that have migrated for the winter is:

20 + 80 = 100

Therefore, there are 100 bird families away from the mountain for the winter."
Response:  The original text states that there are currently 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 18 new bird families arrive, then the total number of bird families will increase to 105 (87 + 18).
"Response:  We know that 59 bird families have left for warmer climates and 24 new bird families have arrived from the Arctic. So, we need to find out how many bird families were still present near the mountain after these movements.
Let's assume that there are 49 bird families initially living near the mountain. Now, let's subtract the number of families that have left (59) and the number of families that have arrived (24):
49 - 59 = -10
So, there were only 39 bird families remaining near the mountain after all the movements."
Response:  We know that 27 bird families have migrated to warmer countries and only 14 are left near the mountain. So, initially there were 41 bird families living nearby the mountain (41 - 27 = 14).
Response:  We know that initially there were 45 bird families living near the mountain and now only 86 bird families have migrated to warmer countries for winter. So, we can say that 39 bird families (86 - 45) have left than remained near the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families living near the mountain and we also know that 35 of them have migrated to Asia. So, the number of bird families left behind is equal to 41 minus 35 = 7. Now, we are told that 62 bird families have migrated to Africa. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that migrated to Africa and those that migrated to Asia is equal to 62 - 35 = 27. So, more birds have migrated to Africa than to Asia.
"Response: 
1. The original 3 bird families that live near the mountain are still there (we don't know how many individuals of each family).
2. 26 new bird families have migrated to the area from the arctic (let's assume they are evenly distributed among the different families).
3. 2 bird families moved south for the winter (again, let's assume they are evenly distributed among the different families).
4. So, the total number of bird families left in the area is: 3 + 26 - 2 = 37.
Therefore, there were 37 bird families living near the mountain after the migration."
Response:  We know that Paul received 253 buntstifts for his birthday and he lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, we can write an equation: 253 - 70 = x, where x is the number of sticks Paul has at the end of the school year. Now we need to solve this equation to find out how many sticks Paul had left. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 70: x / 70 = 183. This means that Paul had 183 buntstifts left at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul had 551 bunty sticks at first and lost or gave away some of them during the school year. So he must have ended up with fewer than 551. How many fewer? Well, if he has only 177 left, then he must have started with 551 - 177 = 374 more than he has now. Therefore, Paul received 374 bunty sticks for his birthday.
"Response: 
Paul received 440 buntstifts for his birthday.
During the school year, he gave away 111 buntstifts to his friends. So now he has 329 buntstifts left (440 - 111 = 329).
Then, he lost 106 buntstifts. Now he has 223 buntstifts left (329 - 106 = 223)."
Response:  We know that Paul received 65 crayons for his birthday and gave away 213 during the school year. So, he lost 16 crayons, which means he has 49 left (65 - 16 = 49). Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  We know that Paul received 589 crayons for his birthday and gave away 571 during the school year. This means he has 16 more crayons than he gave away (589 - 571 = 16). Now we are asked how many crayons Paul gave away more than he lost. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of crayons he lost (161) from the number of crayons he gave away (571): 571 - 161 = 410. So, Paul gave away 410 more crayons than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 buntstifts for his birthday and gave away 90 during the school year. This means he has 21 left (110 - 90 = 21). Now we are told that he lost 412 buntstiften. So, if he had 21 left at first, then he must have lost 391 buntstiften (412 - 21 = 391). Therefore, Paul has more buntstiften than he gave away to his friends.
"Response:  We know that Paul gave away 563 sticks during the school year and lost 558 sticks. So he has 332 sticks left. Now we are asked how many stick he got for his birthday. Since it is written ""only 332 sticks"", we can conclude that he received 332 sticks as gift for his birthday."
Response:  We know that Paul received 50 sticks of crayons as a gift and gave away 52 during the school year. This means he had 50 - 52 = -7 sticks of crayons left over at first. Then we are told that he lost or gave away 535 more sticks of crayons, which brings us to the final total of 492 sticks of crayons remaining. So, the number of sticks of crayons that were lost or given away is equal to 535 - (-7) = 528 sticks of crayons.
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 buntstifts and 66 radiergummies for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had only 154 left without losing or giving away any radiergummies. So we can conclude that he lost or gave away 367 buntstifts (521 - 154 = 367).
Response:  We know that Paul received 531 buntstifts and 38 radiergummies as gifts for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 391 buntstifts left without losing any. So we can write an equation: 531 + 38 = x, where x is the number of buntstifts Paul had at the end of the school year. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 38 from both sides of the equation: 531 - 38 = x. Simplifying, we get x = 493. Therefore, Paul had 493 more buntstifts than radiergummies at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Paul received 601 buntstifts and 406 radiergummies for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 336 left without losing any radiergummies. So we can write an equation: 601 + 406 = x, where x is the number of buntstifts Paul had at the end of the school year. Now we have to solve for x. To do this, we need to subtract 406 from both sides of the equation: 601 + 406 = x → 205 = x - 406. Simplifying the right-hand side gives us x = 169. Therefore, Paul had more than 169 radiergummies at the end of the school year compared to the number of buntstifts he had.
"Response:  We know that Paul received x sticks of crayons for his birthday and he had y at the end of the school year. Since he lost or gave away some of them, we can write an equation as follows: 
x + (y - 291) = 315
Now solve for x using algebraic methods. "
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 buntstifts for his birthday and lost 231 during the school year. So he has 36 (267 - 231) left. Now we are asked how many more buntstifts he gave away than he lost. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of buntstifts he gave away from the number of buntstifts he had left. Therefore, the answer is: 36 - 308 = -272. So, Paul gave away more buntstifts than he lost.
Response:  We know that Paul received 457 Radiergummies and 320 Buntstiften for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he had 523 items left without losing any. So we can write an equation based on this information: Number of Radiergummies = 457 + (Number of Buntstiften - number lost) Since Paul did not lose any Buntstiften, we can substitute the value of 320 into the equation: Number of Radiergummies = 457 + 320 = 777 Now we want to find out how many more Buntstiften Paul had than Radiergummies. To do this, we subtract the number of Radiergummies from the total number of items Paul had at the beginning of the school year: Number of Buntstiften excess = Total number of items - Number of Radiergummies = 777 - 457 = 320 Therefore, Paul had 320 more Buntstiften than Radiergummies at the end of the school year.
Response:  The kellner had initially 11 customers. After some of them left, he was left with 3 customers. To find out how many more customers left than remained, we need to subtract the number of remaining customers from the initial number of customers. So, the answer is: 11 - 3 = 8. Therefore, 8 more customers left than remained.
Response:  The kellner had 3 customers initially and then some left. So he had less than 3 customers remaining after they left. But we are told that he still has 4 customers now. Therefore, there must be one customer who remained behind. So the answer is 1.
Response:  The kellner had x customers at first. After 9 customers left, he had 9 + x = 12 customers remaining. So, we can set up an equation: x + 9 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, the kellner had 3 customers at the beginning.
Response:  The kellner had initially 14 customers. If 5 of them have left, then he has less customers now. So, the number of customers he has now is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, the kellner has 9 customers remaining.
Response:  The kellner had initially 13 customers and then some left. After that, he got 4 new customers. So, if he still has 9 customers, it means that 4 + 13 = 17 customers have gone away. Therefore, 17 customers went away.
Response:  The kellner had initially 12 customers and then 15 customers left. So he has less customers now than before. Then new customers came in and he got 14 of them. Now let's calculate how many customers the kellner has: Initially he had 12 - 15 = -3 customers. Then he gained 14 new customers, so he has +14 = 17 customers now. Therefore, the kellner has 17 customers now.
Response:  The kellner had 3 customers initially and then some more arrived, making it 8 customers in total. So, new customers who have arrived = 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  The kellner had 8 customers at first and then some left, so he had 5 customers remaining. Then, 99 new customers arrived, which means that the total number of customers is now 104 (8 + 5 + 99). So, 8 - 8 = 0 customers went away.
Response:  The kellner had 12 customers initially and some of them left, so he had less than 12 customers. Then, 10 new customers arrived, so now he has more than 12 customers again. Therefore, his current number of customers is between 12 and 22 (including both initial and new customers).
Response:  Originally, Dan had $x dollars. After buying a chocolate bar for $2, he has $2 left and $x - $2 = $3 remaining. So, x = $5. Therefore, originally, Dan had $5 dollars.
"Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and then he spent some money on a chocolate bar. So, let's say the cost of the chocolate bar is x. Since Dan had $4 initially and after buying the chocolate bar, he only had $3 left, we can write an equation as follows: 
x + 4 = 3
Now solve for x to find out how much the chocolate bar cost. 
Solution: To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable 'x'. In this case, we have the equation: 
x + 4 = 3
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
x = -1
So, the chocolate bar cost $1."
"Response:  If Dan has $4 and buys 99 chocolate bars for $3 each, he will spend a total of:
$4 + ($99 x $3) = $4 + $297 = $321
So, there is $321 left over after buying all the chocolate bars."
Response:  If Dan has $3 and buys 2 chocolate bars for $8 each, then he will have spent a total of $8 + $8 = $16. So, each chocolate bar costs $16 / 2 = $8.
Response:  If Dan has $2 and buys each chocolate bar for $3, he will spend all of his money. So, if he buys x chocolate bars, he will have spent $x \* 3 = 6x dollars in total. Since he only has $2 to start with, we know that x must be less than or equal to 2. Therefore, Dan has bought at most 2 chocolate bars.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $2 for the chocolate bar and $3 for the chocolate. So he has $7 - $2 = $5 left after buying those items. Therefore, there is $5 remaining in his pocket.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is equal to $7 + $6 = $13. So, he has $13 - $4 = $9 left after buying the chocolate bar and the chocolate.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is equal to $6 + $3 = $9. So, he has spent $9 to buy the chocolate bar compared to the chocolate.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is $2 + $3 = $5. So he has $5 - $5 = $0 left after buying both items. Therefore, he spent all his money to buy the chocolate bar compared to the cookie.
Response:  Firstly, Dan had $4. Then he bought a chocolate bar for $8, so now he has $4 - $8 = $-4. Later, his friend gave him $5, so now he has $5 + ($-4) = $1. So, there is $1 left over.
Response:  At first, Dan had $4. After buying a chocolate bar, he was left with $3. So, the cost of the chocolate bar is $4 - $3 = $1.
Response:  Dan spent $3 for 10 chocolate bars, so he spent $3 x 10 = $30. So, there is $4 - $30 = $1 left over.
Response:  We know that Dan has spent $3 to buy 2 chocolate bars. So he has $3 - $3 = $0 left after buying them. Therefore, each chocolate bar costs $0 / 2 = $0.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is equal to $3 + $7 = $10. So he has spent $10 to buy the chocolate bar compared to the chocolate bar.
Response:  The total amount of money that Dan spent is given as $7 + $2 = $9. So he spent $9 on the chocolate bar and $2 on the cookie. Therefore, he spent more money on the chocolate bar than on the cookie ($9 vs. $2).
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 115 books and he sold 78 of them at a garage sale. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books Paul has = Initial number of books - Number of books sold

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation:

Number of books Paul has = 115 - 78
= 37

Therefore, Paul has 37 books left after selling 78 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul had 137 books at first and then he sold some of them at a garage sale. So let's assume that he sold x books at the garage sale. Now we have 137 - x books left with him. Since he still has 105 books after selling some, we can conclude that x = 30 (since 105 is the number of books he still has). Therefore, Paul had 137 books at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and after selling some of them he had 73 books left (given in the problem statement). Now we are asked how many books he sold at the garage sale. To find this out, let's divide the number of books he had left (73) by the number of friends he gave books to (35):

73 / 35 = 2
So, Paul sold 2 x 108 = 216 books at the garage sale."
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 50 books and after buying some from a flea market, he has 151 left. So, we can calculate how many books he bought as follows:
Number of books Paul bought = Total number of books - Initial number of books
= 151 - 50
= 101
Therefore, Paul bought 101 books from the flea market."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 2 books (the number is given in the question). Then he sold some of them at a flea market and bought new ones. The total number of books he has now is 150 + 2 = 152. Finally, we are told that he has 58 books left. So, the number of books he sold is equal to the number of books he has left minus the initial number of books he had: 58 - 2 = 56.
"Response:  We know that Paul had initially 21 books and sold some of them at a flea market. Then he bought 42 new books. So, his current number of books is:

Paul = initial books + books bought
= 21 + 42
= 63

Now, we are asked how many books he has more than he bought. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of books he bought (42) from the total number of books he currently has (63):

More books than bought = Total books - Books bought
= 63 - 42
= 21

Therefore, Paul has 21 more books than he bought."
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 71 books and later sold some of them at a flea market. So he had fewer books than before. Then, he bought 38 new books, which means he has more books now than he did earlier. Finally, we are told that he has 116 books in total. Therefore, the number of books he has bought is equal to the number of books he has sold minus the number of books he already had (i.e., 38 - 71 = -33). So, he has bought 33 books more than he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and 55 stifts. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 stiffs left. So, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = Total number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 106 stifts and he sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling some, he had 82 books and 14 stifts left. So, we can calculate how many stifts he sold by subtracting the number of stifts he had after the sale from the initial amount: Number of stifts sold = Initial number of stifts - Number of stifts after the sale = 106 - 82 = 24 Therefore, Paul sold 24 stifts at the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul had initially 136 books and sold some of them at a garage sale, then he has 27 books left. To find out how many books he sold, we can divide the number of books he has left (27) by the initial number of books (136): 27 / 136 = x. Since x is a whole number, we know that Paul sold exactly 109 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 134 books and gave away 39 to his friend. So he has 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Now we are told that he sold some of them at a flea market. Let's assume he sold x books there. Since he still has 68 books left after selling x books, we can write the equation: 95 - x = 68. Solving for x, we get x = 27. Therefore, Paul sold 27 books at the flea market.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 95 stifte and 153 books. After selling some of them at a garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 stifte left. So, we can write an equation: 95 + 153 = x (where x is the number of books sold). Now, we need to find out how many books Paul sold at the garage sale. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 95 / 2 = 47.5 books. Therefore, Paul sold 47.5 books at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 stiften and 143 books. After selling some books and stifts at a garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 stifts left. So we can calculate how many stifts he sold as follows: Number of stifts sold = Total number of stifts - Remaining stifts = 42 + 19 = 61 stifts. Therefore, Paul sold 61 stifts at the garage sale.
Response:  There were initially 10 roses in the vase. Then Jessica added 8 more roses from her garden, so there are now 10 + 8 = 18 roses in the vase. Therefore, there are 18 roses in the vase.
Response:  At first, there were some roses in the vase (we don't know how many). Then Jessica cut 16 more roses from her garden and put them into the vase. So, now there are 23 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses were initially in the vase, we need to subtract the number of new roses (16) from the total number of roses now (23): 23 - 16 = 7. Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.
Response:  There were initially 2 roses in the vase. Then Jessica threw away 4 roses and cut some new ones from her garden to put them in the vase. So there are now 2 + 4 = 6 roses in the vase. Finally, she added more roses from her garden, so there are now 6 + x = 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, x = 17.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 15 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica threw away 33 roses and cut some new ones from her garden to replace them. So, the total number of roses after she did this is: 15 + (33 - 15) = 48 roses. Therefore, Jessica has more cut than thrown away.
Response:  Firstly, there were 21 roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica threw away 34 roses and cut some new ones from her garden to place them in the vase. So, after these actions, there are 15 roses left in the vase. Now, we need to find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than she cut from her garden. To do this, we can subtract the number of roses she cut (34) from the number of roses she threw away (34 - 34 = 0). Therefore, Jessica did not throw away any rose more than she cut from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 7 roses in the vase and then Jessica cut some more from her garden, which had a total of 59 roses. So, she must have cut 52 roses (59 - 7 = 52). Now, we are told that 20 roses are left in the vase after she has cut them. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica cut is equal to the number of roses left in the vase minus the initial number of roses in the vase, i.e., 52 - 7 = 45.
Response:  Firstly, there were initially 13 roses in the vase and Jessica cut some from her garden that had 12 roses in total. So, the number of roses she brought to the vase is 13 + 12 = 25 roses. Now, there are 21 roses in the vase, so the number of roses left in the garden is 21 - 25 = -4 roses. Therefore, there are -4 roses still in Jessica's garden.
Response:  There were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So, there are now 17 roses in total (including both those already in the vase and the ones Jessica cut). However, we know that the number of orchids increased by 30 (from 62 to 96), so the total number of flowers in the vase is 17 + 30 = 47. Therefore, Jessica has cut 18 roses (15 initial + 3 additional).
Response:  There were initially 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so there are now 10 roses in total (including the initial ones). Since she also cut some orchids from her garden, there are now 21 orchids in the vase (including the initial two). Therefore, Jessica has cut 19 orchids (21 - 2 = 19).
Response:  There were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 12 roses in total (including the initial 5). However, we know that Jessica did not add any new orchids to the vase. Therefore, the number of orchids remains unchanged at 3. So, the ratio of roses to orchids in the vase is 12:3 or 4:1.
Response:  There were initially 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase, so now there are 11 roses in total (including the initial ones). However, since we know that Jessica also has orchids in her garden, let's assume she brought some of those as well. So, the number of orchids in the vase increased by 20 - 12 = 8 additional orchids. Therefore, there are currently 20 orchids in the vase, which is 8 more than the number of roses.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and now there are 19 roses, then she must have cut 16 additional roses (19 - 3 = 16). So, she has cut 16 roses from her garden to put them in the vase.
Response:  There were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden to add to the vase, making it 91 orchids and 14 roses total. So, Jessica has cut 5 roses (14 - 9 = 5).
Response:  There were initially 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. Since there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase, we can deduce that Jessica cut 3 orchids (7 - 3 =). So, she has cut 3 orchids.
Response:  There were initially 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden to add to the vase, so there are now 22 roses in total (including both the original 6 and the new ones). However, we know that Jessica did not cut any orchids from her garden, so there are still 20 orchids in the vase. Therefore, there are 22 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase, we can simply subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses: 22 - 20 = 2. So, there are 2 more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  There were initially 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica cut some more roses from her garden to add to the vase, making it 13 orichids and 3 roses. So now there are 4 more orchids than roses in the vase (13-3=10). Therefore, there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase currently.  
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some of it, then her new length is 13 inches. To find out how much she cut off, we can subtract the original length from the new length: 13 - 17 = -4 inches. So, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.
Response:  Before cutting her hair, Robin had 30 zoll (20 + 10) of hair. So, her hair was 30 zoll long before she cut it.
Response:  At first, Robin had 16 inches of hair (Zoll = inches). Then she cut it to 11 inches. So now she has 5 inches less than before (16 - 11 = 5). After that, her hair grew another 12 inches, so now she has 17 inches of hair in total (5 + 12 = 17). Therefore, Robin's hair is now 17 inches long.
"Response:  If Robins Hair was initially 19 inches long and it grows another 18 inches, then its new length would be:  
19 + (18 x 1) = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long."
"Response:  If Robin had 13 inches of her hair cut off and her hair was originally 14 inches long, then we can calculate how long it is now as follows:
Length before = 14 inches
Length after = Length before - 13 inches
So, Robin's hair length now is 14 - 13 = 1 inch or 1 foot. Therefore, Robin's hair is 1 foot long now."
Response:  At first, her hair was 14 inches long (Zoll). Then she grew it by 8 inches (Zoll), so now it is 22 inches long (Zoll). Finally, she cut off 20 inches of it, leaving only 2 inches left. So, her hair length now is 2 inches (Zoll).
Response:  Danny had 12 kronkorken in his collection before he found 53 more in the park. So, the total number of kronkorken Danny has now is: 12 + 53 = 65.
"Response:  We know that Danny has 21 Kronkorken in his collection and he found some more in the park. So, let's say he found x Kronkorken in the park. Now we have:

Danny's collection = 21 + x
Total number of Kronkorken = 53 (given)
Now, we can set up an equation based on these values:

21 + x = 53
Solving for x, we get:
x = 32
So, Danny found 32 Kronkorken in the park."
Response:  Firstly, Danny collected 63 Kronkorken from the park and then he threw away 51 of them. So, he had 63 - 51 = 12 Kronkorken left with him. Now, he has added 3 more to his collection, so he has 12 + 3 = 15 Kronkorken now. Therefore, Danny had 15 Kronkorken at first.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 22 kronkorns and found 36 more in the park. So he has a total of 58 kronkorns now (22 + 36). Now we need to find out how many kronkorns he threw away. According to the question, he threw away 35 old ones. Therefore, the number of kronkorns he threw away is equal to the number he found minus the number he already had (58 - 35) = 23. So Danny found more kronkorns than he threw away!
Response:  We know that Danny has found 30 kronkorns in the park and he has thrown away 63 old ones. So, the total number of kronkorns he threw away is 63 - 30 = 33. Now we know that he has 42 kronkorns in his collection, so he must have collected 42 - 33 = 9 more than he threw away. Therefore, Danny threw away 33 kronkorns more than he found in the park.
Response:  At first, Danny had 0 Flaschenverschlüsse and 0 Verpackungen. Then he found 22 Flaschenverschlüsse and 8 Verpackungen in the park. So, now he has 22 + 8 = 30 Flaschenverschlüsse and 8 + 0 = 8 Verpackungen. Finally, he collected more Flaschenverschlüsse and Verpackungen, so his total collection is 30 + x = 28 Flaschenverschlüsse and 63 + y = 63 Verpackungen, where x and y are unknown variables. Therefore, the answer to the question is x = 5 and y = 57.
Response:  At first, Danny had 30 Verpackungen. Then he found 22 more Flaschenverschlüsse and added them to his collection. So, now he has 17 + 22 = 39 Flaschenverschlüsse. And he still has all the original 30 Verpackungen, so the total number of packages is 30 + 39 = 69 packages. Therefore, at first, Danny had 30 packages.
Response:  We know that Danny found 30 Flaschenverschlüsse and 14 Verpackungen in the park initially. So, he had 30 + 14 = 44 items in his collection initially. Now, he has 7 more Flaschenverschlüsse, which means he has 44 + 7 = 51 items in his collection now. And we also know that he has 86 Verpackungen now, so the number of Verpackungen is 51 - 86 = -35. Therefore, Danny has more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 11 Flaschenverschlüsse and 28 Verpackungen in the park initially. So, he had 39 items (Flaschenverschlüsse + Verpackungen) initially. Now, he has 68 Flaschenverschlüsse and 51 Verpackungen in his collection, so he found additional 23 Verpackungen (68 - 39 = 23). Therefore, Danny found more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse in the park. The number of Verpackungen found exceeds the number of Flaschenverschlüsse found by 23.
Response:  We know that Danny had 71 Flaschenverschlüsse and 24 Verpackungen initially. Then he found more Flaschenverschlüsse and Verpackungen in his park collection, which are as follows: 28 Flaschenverschlüsse and 16 Verpackungen. Now we need to find out how many Flaschenverschlüsse Danny has more than Verpackungen. To do this, we subtract the number of Verpackungen from the total number of Flaschenverschlüsse: 71 - 24 = 47. So, Danny has 47 Flaschenverschlüsse more than Verpackungen.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 10 Flaschenverschlüsse and 62 Verpackungen in the park. So, he started with more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse (62 vs 10). Then, he found additional 27 Flaschenverschlüsse and 43 Verpackungen in his collection. Now, we can see that he has more Flaschenverschlüsse than Verpackungen (27 vs 43), so he has more Flaschenverschlüsse than he did initially. Therefore, the answer is 43 - 27 = 16.
Response:  At first, Danny had 66 Kronkorken in the park. Then he lost some of them and now he has 25 in his collection. So, to find out how many Kronkorken Danny had at first, we can subtract the number he has now from the total number he had: 66 - 25 = 41. Therefore, Danny had 41 Kronkorken at first.
Response:  If Danny had 25 flaschenverschlusse in his collection before and found additional 32 flaschenverschlüsse in the park, then he has a total of 25 + 32 = 57 flaschenverschlüsse now.
Response:  At first, Danny had 60 old kronkorkens and he threw away 60 of them. So now he has 60 - 60 = 0 new kronkorken. Then he found 58 new kronkorken, so he has 0 + 58 = 58 new kronkorken. In total, Danny has 58 + 60 = 118 kronkorken. Therefore, Danny had 118 kronkorken at the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 6 old kronkorns and found 50 new ones, so he has a total of 60 kronkorns now. To find out how many more kronkorns he found than he threw away, we need to subtract the number of kronkorns he threw away from the number of kronkorns he found: 50 - 6 = 44. So, Danny found 44 more kronkorns in the park than he threw away.
Response:  We know that Danny has collected 52 kronkorns and thrown away 54 old ones. So he threw away more than he found. The difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of kronkorns he threw away minus the number he found = -54-48=6. Therefore, Danny threw away six more kronkorns than he found.
Response:  At first, Danny had 82 Verpackungen and 0 Flaschenverschlüsse (since he found none). Then, he found 29 Flaschenverschlüsse and added them to his collection. So, now he has 82 + 29 = 111 items in total. Among these, there are 42 Flaschenverschlüsse, which means that initially, Danny had 42 - 0 = 42 Flaschenverschlüsse. Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  We know that Danny found 66 packaging and 39 bottle caps at first. Then he collected 16 more bottle caps and 68 additional packages. So, initially, Danny had 66 + 16 = 82 packaging.
Response:  We know that Danny found 46 packaging and 50 bottle caps in the park initially. So he had 46 + 50 = 96 items at first. Now we are told that he has 21 more bottle caps than packages. Therefore, the number of bottles he has is 96 - 21 = 75. So, Danny found more bottle caps than packages in the park.  
Response:  We know that Danny found 65 packages and 5 flaschenverschlusses in the park initially. So he had 65 + 5 = 70 items in his collection initially. Now we are told that he has 31 flaschenverschlusses and 9 packages in his collection. Therefore, the number of packages more than flaschenverschlusses is:  9 - 31 = -22 packages. 
Response:  We know that Danny had 58 Flaschenverschlüsse and 25 Verpackungen initially. So, he had a total of 58 + 25 = 83 items at first. Now, we are told that he has 11 more Verpackungen than Flaschenverschlüsse. Therefore, the number of Flaschenverschlüsse he has now is 83 - 11 = 72. Finally, we are also told that he has 12 more Flaschenverschlüsse than Verpackungen. So, the number of Verpackungen he has is 12. Hence, the answer to the question is 72 - 12 = 60.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 15 Flaschenverschlüsse and 18 Verpackungen. So, he had a total of 33 items (Flaschenverschlüsse + Verpackungen). Now, after collecting more items from the park, he has a total of 67 Verpackungen and 35 Flaschenverschlüsse. Therefore, the number of Verpackungen that Danny now has more than Flaschenverschlüsse is:  67 - 35 = 32.
Response:  We know that Jake has 11 fewer pears than Steven. So if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 11 pears. Since Jake has 17 pears, we can set up the equation: x = 17 - 11. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, Steven has 6 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 14 pears. Since Jill has more pears than Steven, Jill has x + 14 - 7 = 21 pears. Therefore, Jake has 21 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven, so Jake has x pears. Since Steven has more pears than Jake, Steven has x + 13 pears. And since Steven has 19 pears in total, we can write an equation: x + (x + 13) = 19. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 13 = 19. Subtracting 13 from both sides gives us 2x = 6. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 3. So, Jill has 3 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 5 pears. Since Jill has more pears than Jake, she has x + 1 pear. Therefore, Jake has more pears than Jill by 2 pears (x - (x + 1)).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven, so Jake has x pears. Since Steven has more pears than Jill, Steven has x + 4 pears. Therefore, Jill has x + 4 - 12 = 7 more pears than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more pears than Jill. So, if we can find out how many pears Steven has, then we will be able to calculate how many pears Jake has. According to the information given in the question, Steven has 16 pears. Therefore, Jake has 16 - 7 = 9 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more pears than Jill. So, if we can find out how many pears Jake has, we will be able to determine how many pears Jill has. According to the information provided in the question, Jake has 7 fewer pears than Steven. This means that Jake has x pears, where x is equal to 17 minus 7 = 10. Therefore, Jill has 10 + 8 = 18 pears.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven and more pears than Jill. So we can write this information as an equation:
Jake = x (where ""x"" represents the number of pears that Jake has)
Steven = 9 - x (where ""x"" represents the number of pears that Steven has)
Jill = x + 18 (where ""x"" represents the number of pears that Jill has)
Now we need to solve for ""x"", which is the number of pears that Steven has more than Jill. Using the first two equations, we can set up the following system of linear equations:
Jake = 9
Steven = 9 - x
Jill = x + 18
Solving for ""x"", we get:
x = 7
So Steven has 7 more pears than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more pears than Jake. So if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 18 = 24 pears. Now we are told that Jill has 5 fewer pears than Jake. So Jill has x - 5 = 9 pears. Therefore, Jake has 24 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 5 pears. Since Jill has 87 pears more than Steven, Jill has (x + 5) + 87 = 92 pears. Therefore, Jake has 92 - x pears more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 16 pears. Now we know that Steven has more pears than Jill, so Jill has x - 16 pears. Therefore, Jill has 48 pears less than Steven.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 12 pears. Since Steven has more apples than Jake, we can say that Steven has x + 14 apples. Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: x + (x + 12) = 79... (1) Substituting x = 16 from the problem statement gives us: 16 + (16 + 12) = 79... (2) Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 38 = 79... (3) Therefore, Jake has 38 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has x + 3 pears. Since Jake has 13 fewer pears than Steven, we can write an equation as follows: x - 13 = (x + 3) - 13. Simplifying this equation, we get x = 20. Therefore, Jake has 20 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steve... So let's start with Jake and subtract his number of pears from his total fruit count to get an idea of how many more apples he has compared to Steve. According to the problem statement, Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steve, which means he has 6 + 8 = 14 more apples than Steve. Therefore, Steven has 17 - 14 = 3 more pears than apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has 3 fewer pears than Steven and 10 more apples than Steven. So, if we write it down like this:
Jake: 3 Pfirsiche - 10 Äpfel = x Äpfel
Steven: 12 Pfirsiche + 15 Äpfel = y Äpfel
Now we can solve for ""x"" (the number of apples Jake has):
x = 12 - 3 = 9
So, Jake has 9 apples. Now let's find out how many more apples than pears Steven has:
y - x = 15 - 9 = 6
Steven has 6 more apples than pears."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 pears and Jake has fewer than 12 pears. So, Jake must have 0 to 11 pears. Since Jill has more pears than Jake, we can say that Jill has at least 12 - 4 = 8 pears. Therefore, Jake has 0 to 11 pears, which means he has exactly 4 pears.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 18 pears and Jake has fewer than 18 pears. So, Jake must have 17 or fewer pears. Additionally, we know that Jake has 12 fewer pears than Steven, which means that if Steven has x pears, then Jake has x - 12 pears. Now, we are also told that Jill has 8 more pears than Steven. Therefore, if Steven has x pears, then Jill has x + 8 pears. Finally, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for x: x = 18 (Steven) + (-12) = 6 (Jake) + 8 = 14 (Jill). So, Jill has 14 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 pears and Jake has x pears less than Steven. So, Jake has 19 - x pears. Also, we know that Jill has 72 more pears than Jake. Therefore, Jill has 72 + x = 19 pears. Now, we can solve for x using subtraction. x = 19 - 72 = -53. So, Jake has 53 pears.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 pears and Jake has fewer than 14 pears. So, Jake must have 14 - x pears, where x is the number of pears Jake has. Also, we know that Jill has more pears than Jake, so Jill has 3 + x pears. Therefore, Jill has 3 + (14 - x) = 27 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven and 10 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Steven has x pears, then Jake has 84 + x = 94 pears. Since Steven has 13 pears, we can set up the equation: 94 - 13 = x. Solving for x gives us x = 81. Therefore, Jake has 81 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if we add up all their fruit, Jake must have x apples. Since Steven has 8 pears and 12 apples, he has a total of 20 fruits (8 + 12 = 20). Therefore, Jake must have at least 20 - 13 = 7 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears and Steven has y apples, then we can write an equation as follows:
x - 8 = y + 10
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:
x - 8 = 11 + 18
Solving for x, we get:
x = 29
So, Steven has 29 more pears than Jake."
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears and Steven has y apples, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 4 = y (since Steven has 4 more apples than Jake)
Now, we are told that Steven has 19 apples in total. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation to solve for y:
x + 4 = 19
Solving for x, we get:
x = 15
So, Steven has 15 more apples than Jake."
Response:  If there were $78 in Olivia's money box and she spent $15 at the supermarket, then she has $63 left. So, the answer is $63.
Response:  If Olivia had originally $100 (not $78 as stated in the problem), and she spent $78 at the supermarket, then she has $22 left ($100 - $78 = $22). So, the correct answer is $22.
Response:  If there were initially $100 in Olivia's wallet and she withdrew $148 from an ATM, then there would be $62 left ($100 - $148). After visiting the supermarket, there are still $159 dollars left, which means that Olivia spent $97 ($159 - $62) at the supermarket.
"Response:  We know that in Oliva's briefcase were $3 dollars and she took $49 from an ATM. After visiting the supermarket, there were still $49 dollars left. So, we can write this equation: 
$3 + ($49 - $x) = $49
Where x is the amount of money she spent at the supermarket. Solving for x, we get:
$3 + ($49 - $x) = $49
Subtracting $3 from both sides gives us:
($46 - $x) = $49
Dividing both sides by $46 gives us:
x = $13
So, Olivia spent $13 at the supermarket."
Response:  We know that there were originally $53 in Olivia's wallet and she withdrew $91 from an ATM. So, after withdrawing money from the ATM, there were $53 + $91 = $144 in her wallet. Then, she spent some amount of money at the supermarket, leaving $144 - $14 = $130 remaining in her wallet. Therefore, Olivia spent more money at the supermarket than she withdrew from the ATM ($14 > $9).
Response:  We know that in Oliva's briefcase there were initially $106 dollars. After visiting an exhibition and spending $49 dollars in the showroom, she had $57 dollars left ($106 - $49 = $57). Therefore, she spent $26 dollars at the supermarket ($57 - $26 = $31).
Response:  If Olivia had $54 initially and spent $29 at the supermarket, then she has $25 left ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  At first, Olivia had $128 - $38 = $90 left in her wallet. So she has $90 now.
Response:  Before deleting 5 apps, Dave had 19 apps on his phone. So, after deleting 5 apps, he has 19 - 5 = 14 apps left on his phone. Therefore, there are 14 apps still on Dave's handy.
Response:  At first, Dave had x apps on his phone. After he deleted some of them, he was left with y apps. Since he deleted 18 apps in total, we can write an equation as follows: x - 18 = y + 5. Solving for x, we get: x = y + 23. So, at the beginning, Dave had 23 apps on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 10 apps on his phone and then added 11 new ones. So, he has a total of 21 apps (10 + 11). Now, we are told that after deleting some apps, he was left with 4 apps. Therefore, the number of apps that Dave deleted is equal to the difference between the total number of apps he had and the number of apps he has left, which is:  21 - 4 = 17. So, Dave deleted 17 apps.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 21 apps on his phone and then added 89 new ones. So, in total he has 21 + 89 = 110 apps now. Then we are told that after deleting some of them, there were 24 apps left. Therefore, the number of apps that Dave more added than deleted is: 110 - 24 = 86.
Response:  If Dave had initially 15 apps and added 71 new ones, then he has a total of 86 apps (15 + 71). Now, if he deleted some apps, let's say he deleted 20, then he has 66 apps left (86 - 20 = 66). So, he more apps deleted than added.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 16 apps and 77 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 5 apps and 23 files left. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of apps = initial number of apps - number of apps deleted (in this case, 5) Number of files = initial number of files - number of files deleted (in this case, 23). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the information we need to find out how many apps Dave deleted. Therefore, the answer is 11 apps (initially there were 16 - 11 = 5 apps remaining after deletion).
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 21 files and 17 apps on his phone. If he deleted some apps and files, we can assume that he has fewer apps and files now. So, let's write down what we know:

Initially, Dave had:

* 21 files
* 17 apps

After deleting some apps and files, Dave has:

* 3 apps (remaining)
* 7 files (remaining)

So, Dave has deleted 14 files (21 - 7 = 14)."
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files. To find out how many more apps than files Dave has on his phone, we can subtract the number of files from the number of apps: 21 - 4 = 17. So, Dave has 17 more apps than files on his phone.
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 18 files and 19 apps on his phone. If he deleted some apps and files, then we can say that he has fewer apps and files now. So, let's write an equation to represent this situation:

Number of apps = 19 - x
Number of files = 18 - y

Where x and y are the number of apps and files that Dave deleted respectively.
Now, we are told that after deleting some apps and files, Dave has 6 apps and 15 files left on his phone. So, we can substitute these values in the equations above:

Number of apps = 19 - 6 = 13
Number of files = 18 - 15 = 3

Therefore, Dave has 13 apps and 3 files more than the number of apps he has on his phone."
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 apps on his phone initially and then he added some more. So, let's say he added x number of apps. Now we have 17 + x = 18. Solving for x, we get x = 1. Therefore, Dave added 1 app to his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 59 files and apps on his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, we can say that Dave deleted 47 apps (59 - 12 = 47).
"Response:  We know that Dave had initially 24 files and 13 apps on his phone. If he deleted some apps and files, then we can say that he has X fewer apps and files than before. So, let's write an equation:

X = 24 - (13 + 17)

Now, simplify the equation:

X = 24 - 30

X = -6

So, Dave deleted 6 files and apps from his phone."
Response:  Before deleting apps and files, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 apps. So, now he has more apps than files on his phone. Therefore, the number of apps that Dave has more than files is 12 - 5 = 7.
Response:  We know that Dave had initially 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 apps. So, we can say that Dave deleted 9 apps (11 - 2 = 9) and 1 file (3 - 2 = 1). Therefore, Dave has more files than apps on his phone now. The number of files he has is 24, and the number of apps he has is 2.
Response:  If Nell had 242 baseball cards and gave 136 to Jeff, then she has 242 - 136 = 106 cards left. So, Nell still has 106 baseball cards.
Response:  If Nell had originally 301 baseball cards and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has now 301 - 301 = 0 cards left. So, Nell initially had 0 baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 cards and gave some to Jeff. Now, Nell has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the difference between her original number of cards (528) and her current number of cards (252). Therefore, the answer is 276.
"Response:  If Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. So, if Jeff got some of Nell's cards, he must have had fewer than 535 cards initially. Therefore, the number of cards Jeff has now is:
Jeff = Initial cards - Cards given to Jeff by Nell
= 234 -?
Where? represents the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff.
So, the answer is:
Jeff = 234 - x
where x is the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 10-card packs initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 415 baseball cards and 149 10-card packs. To find out how many baseball cards Nell has more than 10 cards, we need to subtract the number of 10-card packs from the total number of baseball cards. So, the answer is:
Nell has 206 (415 - 149) more than 10 baseball cards."
Response:  We know that Nell had initially 246 baseball cards and 214 10-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 404 baseball cards and 495 10-card packs. To find out how many more 10-card packs than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of card packs: 495 (10-card packs) - 404 (baseball cards) = 91. So, Nell has 91 more 10-card packs than baseball cards.
"Response:  We know that Nell had 573 baseball cards and gave some to John and Jeff. After giving some away, she has 210 cards left. So, if we divide the number of cards she has left (210) by the number of people she gave cards to (2), we get the number of cards she gave to each person:

Number of cards given to John = Number of cards left / Number of people given cards to = 210 / 2 = 105

So, Nell gave 105 baseball cards to John."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card sets. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 55 ten-card sets and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many baseball cards Nell has more than ten-card sets, we can subtract the number of ten-card sets from the total number of baseball cards. So, the answer is:
Nell has 123 (178 - 55) baseball cards more than ten-card sets."
"Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. So she has 376 ten-card sets and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many ten-card sets Nell has more than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of ten-card sets. Therefore, the answer is:
Nell has 376 - 111 = 265 more ten-card sets than baseball cards."
Response:  If Paco had 19 kekses and gave away 19, then he has 0 kekeses left. So at the beginning, he must have had 35 kekeses.
Response:  If Paco had initially 28 kekses and he has eaten some of them, then he must have had x kekses left after eating. Since he still has 7 kekses, we can write an equation as follows: 28 - x = 7. Now solve for x using subtraction: x = 21. So, Paco has eaten 21 kekses.
Response:  Paco had initially 40 kekses and he eat 2 of them so now he has 40 - 2 = 38 kekses left. Then he bought additional 37 kekses, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 kekses in total. Therefore, Paco had 75 kekses left.
Response:  At first, Paco had 25 kekses and he eaten 5 of them, so now he has 20 kekses left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more kekses, so now he has 23 kekses in total (20 + 3 = 23). So, he has more kekses than he bought (23 > 3), therefore the answer is 20.
Response:  Paco had initially 13 kekses and he eat 2 of them, so he has 13 - 2 = 11 left. Then, he bought 36 additional kekses, so now he has 11 + 36 = 47 kekses in total. Therefore, he has more kekses than he ate, which is 47 - 2 = 45 kekses.
Response:  Paco had initially 40 kekses and he eaten 5 of them so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 left. Then he gave 13 to his friend so now he has 35 - 13 = 22 kekses left. Therefore, Paco had 22 kekses left.
Response:  Paco had initially 17 kekses and he has eaten 14 of them. So, now he has 17 - 14 = 3 more kekses than his friend. Therefore, Paco has consumed more kekses than he gave to his friend. The difference between the number of kekses he had and the number of kekses he gave away is equal to the number of kekses he consumed himself. In other words, the answer is 3.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them. So, he has 12 - 16 = -4 left. Now, he gave 21 cookies to his friend. Since he already ate some, we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he gave away. Therefore, the number of cookies he gave to his friend is 21 - (-4) = 25 cookies.
Response:  We know that initially, Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. If he has eaten 15 sweet cookies, then he must have had 9 (22 - 15) sweet cookies left originally. Now, if he has also eaten 54 salty cookies, then he must have had 23 (75 - 54) salty cookies left originally. So, to summarize: Paco had 9 sweet cookies and 23 salty cookies left originally.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 9 sweet cookies and 6 salted cookies. He then ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salted cookies. So, he has eaten a total of 72 cookies (36 sweet + 3 salted). Now, we need to find out how many salted cookies Paco still has left. To do this, we can subtract the number of salted cookies he ate from the initial amount he had: 6 - 3 = 3. Therefore, Paco still has 3 salted cookies left.
Response:  We know that initially, Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salted cookies. If he has eaten 5 sweet cookies and 2 salted cookies, then we can calculate how many more sweet cookies than salted cookies he has eaten as follows: Number of sweet cookies eaten = 5 - 2 = 3 More sweet cookies eaten than salted cookies. Therefore, Paco has eaten 3 more sweet cookies than salted cookies.
Response:  We know that initially Paco had 6 salzige and 8 süße Kekse. Then he ate some of them. He ate 20 süße Kekse and 34 salzige Kekse. So, we can write an equation: Salzige Kekse = Initial amount - Amount eaten (in süße Kekse) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Salzige Kekse = 6 - (8 x 20/100) = 6 - 160 = -154 salzige Kekse have been eaten more than süße Kekse. Therefore, the answer is -154.
Response:  If Paco had initially 37 kekses and he ate 36 of them, then he has x keks left. Since we know that x is equal to 37 minus the number of keks he ate (36), we can write the equation as follows: x = 37 - 36 = 1. So, Paco has one keke left.
Response:  Paco had initially 36 kekses and gave away 14 to his friend. So he has left with 36 - 14 = 22 kekses. Then he ate 10 more kekses, so now he has 22 - 10 = 12 kekses left. Therefore, Paco has 12 kekses left.
Response:  Paco had initially 41 kekses and gave away 9 to his friend. So he has left with 32 kekses (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 kekses, which means that now he has 32 - 18 = 14 kekses more than he gave away to his friend. Therefore, Paco has eaten 14 kekses more than he gave away to his friend.
Response:  Paco had 6 kekses and gave his friend 30 more. So, in total, he has given away 30 + 6 = 36 kekses. Now, he ate 23 kekses himself, so he gave his friend more than he ate. Therefore, the answer is 36 - 23 = 13 kekses.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 97 salted cookies and 34 sweet cookies. He then ate 15 sweet cookies and 56 salted cookies. So, he has eaten a total of 71 cookies (15 + 56). Now, we need to find out how many sweet cookies Paco still has. To do this, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the initial amount of sweet cookies he had: 34 - 15 = 19. Therefore, Paco still has 19 sweet cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco had initially 26 salty cookies and 17 sweet cookies. He then ate 14 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies. So, he has eaten a total of 23 cookies (14 sweet + 9 salty). Now, we need to find out how many salty cookies Paco still has. To do this, we can subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the initial amount he had: 26 - 9 = 17. Therefore, Paco still has 17 salty cookies.
Response:  We know that initially, Paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salted cookies. So, in total, he had 39 + 6 = 45 cookies. Then, we are told that he has eaten 23 of the salted cookies and 32 of the sweet cookies. Therefore, after eating them, he has 45 - 23 = 22 salted cookies left and 32 + 32 = 64 sweet cookies left. Since he ate more sweet than salted cookies, he has eaten more sour than salted cookies. The difference between the number of sweet and salted cookies he ate is equal to the number of sweet cookies he ate. So, the difference between 64 and 22 is 42. Therefore, Paco has eaten 42 more sweet cookies than salted cookies.
Response:  We know that initially, Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salted cookies. So, in total, he had 65 cookies (40 + 25). Then, he ate some of them. He ate 28 salted cookies and 15 sweet cookies. Now, we need to find out how many more salted cookies he ate than sweet cookies. To do this, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salted cookies he had before eating: 28 - 15 = 13. Therefore, Paco has eaten 13 more salted cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  Gwen received $7 for her birthday and spent some of it. So she has $5 left. To find out how much she spent, we can divide the amount she had left ($5) by the amount she received ($7): $5 / $7 = x. Since x is a whole number, Gwen must have spent exactly $x. Therefore, the answer is $x = 3.
Response:  Gwen received $X dollars for her birthday and spent $8 of it. So she has $X - $8 = $6 left. To find out how much money Gwen received, we can set up an equation using this information: X - $8 = $6. Solving for X, we get X = $14. Therefore, Gwen received $14 for her birthday.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mother and then her father gave her $4 more. So she had a total of $6 ($2 + $4). If she spent $3, that means she has $6 - $3 = $3 left.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 more from her father, so she has a total of $13 ($8 + $5). She spent $4, so she now has $9 left ($13 - $4 = $9). Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her father.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so she has a total of $9. She spent $4, so she has $9 - $4 = $5 left. Therefore, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and then spent $4. So she has $9 left ($5 + $4 - $4). Now, her mother gave her $7 more dollars, so Gwen now has $16 ($9 + $7). Therefore, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her father.
Response:  If Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, then she has spent a total of $5 + $2 = $7. So, she still has $5 - $7 = $-2 left with her father. Therefore, she has received more money from her father than from her mother.
Response:  If Josh had 9 murmels and lost some of them, then he has 4 murmels now. So, he must have lost 5 murmels (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  We know that Josh had some murmels in his collection and he lost 21 of them. So, initially, he must have had x murmels in his collection. Now, we are told that he has 12 murmels left. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x - 21 = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 33. So, Josh had 33 murmels in his collection initially.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 murmels in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them and found 5 new ones. So, if we subtract the number of murmels he lost (11) from the total number of murmels he had at first (19), we get the number of murmels he has now: 19 - 11 = 8. Therefore, Josh has 8 murmels left in his collection.
Response:  We know that Josh had 4 murmels in his collection initially and then he lost 16 of them. So, he has 4 - 16 = -12 murmels left. Now, he found 8 new murmels, so he has -12 + 8 = 6 murmels left. Therefore, Josh has more murmels than he lost.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 7 murmels in his collection and lost 8 of them. So he has 7 - 8 = -1 murmel left. Then, he found 10 new murmels. Therefore, he now has -1 + 10 = 9 murmels in total.
Response:  If Josh had 21 murmels and found 7 more, then he has now 21 + 7 = 28 murmels in his collection.
Response:  Josh had initially 20 murmels and gave away 2 to jack. So he has 18 murmels left with him now.
Response:  Josh had initially 22 murmels and then Jack gave him 20 more. So, now he has 22 + 20 = 42 murmels.
Response:  If Josh had 19 murmels before and lost 11 of them, then he has 8 murmels left (19 - 11 = 8). So, Josh now has 8 murmels in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 murmels in his collection. Then he found 13 more murmels and added them to his collection. So, now he has 22 + 13 = 35 murmels. However, he lost 5 murmels, so he actually has 35 - 5 = 30 murmels in his collection now.
Response:  We know that Josh had 15 murmels and found 9 more. So he now has 15 + 9 = 24 murmels. Then we are told that he lost 23 murmels. Therefore, he has 24 - 23 = 1 murmel left. So, Josh has one murmel more than he found.
Response:  We know that Josh had 3 murmurs in his collection and then he found 6 more. So, now he has 3 + 6 = 9 murmers. However, he lost 5 of them, so he is left with 9 - 5 = 4 murmers. Therefore, Josh has 4 more murmers than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 4 pounds of strawberries. This means that Marco alone picked 19 - 4 = 15 pounds of strawberries more than his father. So, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds more than his father's.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father picked 35 pounds of strawberries. If Marco alone had 13 pounds of strawberries, then his father must have had how much more than him? To find this out, we can divide the total weight of their strawberries (35 pounds) by the weight of Marco's strawberries (13 pounds): 35 / 13 = 2.69. So, his father had 2.69 times as many strawberries as Marco!
Response:  We know that together Marco and his father picked 20 pounds of strawberries. His father had 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if they both picked an equal amount of strawberries, then Marco had 3 pounds (20 - 17) of strawberries.
Response:  We know that Marco's Erdbeeren weighed 8 pounds and his father's Erdbeeren weighed 32 pounds. So together they weigh 40 pounds (8 + 32 = 40).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries, so he had 3 pounds left. Therefore, his father must have had 21 pounds of strawberries (24 - 9 = 21).
"Response: 
Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. On their way back home, his father lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So now Marco has 12 pounds of strawberries, which means his father has 36 - 8 = 28 pounds of strawberries left."
"Response: 
Marco and his father together collected 52 pounds of strawberries (22 + 30 = 52).
Now, Marco had 36 pounds of strawberries left, which means that his father had 16 pounds of strawberries left (52 - 36 = 16)."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 37 pounds of strawberries. If Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds, then his father must have had x pounds of strawberries, where x is the difference between 37 and 15, which is 22 pounds. Therefore, his father's strawberries weighed 22 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco's Erdbeeren weighed 30 pounds and his father's Erdbeeren together weighed 17 pounds. So, to find out how much heavier Marco's Erdbeeren were than his father's, we need to subtract the weight of his father's Erdbeeren from the weight of Marco's Erdbeeren: 30 - 17 = 13 pounds. Therefore, Marco's Erdbeeren were 13 pounds heavier than his father's.
Response:  We know that Marco's Erdbeeren weigh 10 pounds and together they weight 26 pounds. So, if Marco's Erdbeeren are X pounds, then his father's Erdbeeren must be 26 - X pounds. To find out how much heavier his father's Erdbeeren are than Marco's, we can subtract X from 26: 26 - X = (X + 10). Solving for X, we get X = 16 pounds. Therefore, Marco's father's Erdbeeren were 16 pounds heavier than Marco's.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 30 pounds of strawberries. If Marco's father had 11 pounds of strawberries alone, then Marco must have had x pounds of strawberries. To find out how much X is, we can divide 30 by 2 (the number of people picking). So, x = 30 / 2 = 15 pounds. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.
"Response:  At first, there were only 2 children in the bus. Then more children got into the bus at the halte stop. So, after the halt... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. At first, there were only 2 children in the bus. Then more children got into the bus at the halte stop. So, after the halt stop, there were 2 + x children in the bus, where x is the number of children who got into the bus at the halte stop. Since the total number of children in the bus was 10, we can set up the equation: 2 + x = 10. Solving for x, we get: x = 8. Therefore, there were 8 more children who got into the bus at the halte stop than there were initially in the bus."
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus and then 38 more children got into the bus at the bus stop. So, now we have to calculate how many children are currently in the bus. To do this, we can use the following calculation: Total number of children = Initial number of children + Number of new children who got into the bus. In our case, the total number of children would be: Total number of children = 26 + 38 = 64 children. Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus.
Response:  The first group of children rode the bus with 3 kids. Then, 2 more kids got on at the bus stop, so now there are 5 kids in total (including the original 3). Therefore, before the bus stop, there were 3 + 5 = 8 kids in the bus.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Then some of them got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children who got off is equal to the difference between the initial number and the final number. In this case, the final number of children in the bus is 21, so we can write:
Number of children who got off = Initial number - Final number
= 43 - 21
= 22
Therefore, 22 children got off at the bus stop."
Response:  Before getting off at the bus stop, there were 41 children in the bus. Then some of them got off, so the number of children left in the bus is 18. So, before the bus stop, there were more children in the bus than now (41 - 18 = 23).
Response:  At first, there were 21 children who rode the bus. Then, 10 of them got off at the bus stop, leaving 11 children inside the bus. Finally, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number to 16. So, the answer is 5 (the difference between the initial number and the final number).
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children who rode the bus. Then, 63 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 14 children still on the bus. So, more children got on the bus than got off. Therefore, the answer is 63 - 14 = 49.
Response:  At first, there were 36 children who rode the bus. Then, 68 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 12 children still on the bus. So, more children got off than got on. Therefore, the answer is 68 - 12 = 56.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more got into it at the halte stop. So, the total number of children who boarded the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Now, some of them got off the bus, but we don't know how many. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the difference between the initial number of children in the bus (62) and the final number of children in the bus (2). So, the number of children who got off the bus is 62 - 2 = 60. Hence, 60 children got off the bus at the halt stop.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children who rode the bus. Then, 82 children got off at the bus stop and 30 children remained inside the bus. So, the number of children who got off is equal to the number of children who stayed inside (82 - 30 = 52). Therefore, 52 more children boarded the bus than left it.
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children who rode the bus and then some got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children who got off is equal to the difference between the initial number of children (23) and the final number of children (8). Therefore, the number of children who got off is 23 - 8 = 15.
Response:  The baker has made 133 kuchens and sold 51 of them. So he still has 82 kuchens left (133 - 51 = 82). Therefore, the baker has more kuchens than he has sold.
Response:  If the baker has 54 kuchens and he sold some of them, then he must have had x kuchens left after selling. Since there are 13 kuchens left, we can write an equation as follows: 54 - x = 13. Now solve for x using basic arithmetic operations. We get x = 41. So, the baker sold 41 kuchens.
Response:  If the baker has sold 145 kuchens and still has 72 left, that means he had initially made 217 kuchens (145 + 72 = 217).
Response:  If the baker has made 155 kuchens and his friend has bought 140 of them, then the baker must have had 15 - 14 = 1 kuen left over after selling to his friend. So, the baker now has 155 - 1 = 154 kuchens left.
Response:  The baker has made 121 kuchens and sold 105 of them, so he still has 16 (121 - 105) kuchens left. Then, he bought new kuchens that are equal to 170 times the number of kuchens he already had, which is 16 + 170 = 186 kuchens. So, the baker now has 186 kuchens in total.
Response:  The baker has made 13 kuchens and sold 91 of them, so he has 40 (13 - 91) left. Then, he bought 154 new kuchens. So, the difference between the number of kuchens he bought and the number he sold is 154 - 91 = 63. Therefore, the baker has more kuchens than he sold.
Response:  The baker has made 170 kuchens and sold 78 of them, so he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new kuchens, which means he now has 63 kuchens left (92 - 31 = 63). So, the baker has more kuchens than he has sold. Therefore, the answer is 63.
Response:  The baker had initially made 110 kuchens and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 kuchens. So now he has a total of 35 + 76 = 111 kuchens. Therefore, the baker has 111 kuchens left.
Response:  The baker has made a total of 144 kuchens and sold 71 of them. So he still has 73 unsolved kuchens (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he makes another 111 kuchens. Now, he has a total of 84 kuchens that he hasn't sold yet (73 + 111 = 184). Therefore, the baker has more than 73 kuchens left to sell because he has 84 in total.
Response:  The baker has made 149 kuchens and 91 pieces of cake. If he sells 10 kuchens and 90 pieces of cake, then he will have 139 kuchens left (149 - 10 = 139).
Response:  The baker has made 7 kuchens and 148 pieces of cake. If he sells 15 kuchens and 103 pieces of cake, then he will have 7 + 148 - 15 = 126 pieces of cake left over.
Response:  The baker has made 126 kuchens and 48 pieces of cake. If he sells 115 kuchens and 81 pieces of cake, then we have to subtract these numbers from the total amount that the baker made. So, the number of kuchens left is: 126 - 115 = 11. And the number of pieces of cake left is: 48 - 81 = -33. Therefore, the baker made more kuchens than pieces of cake.
Response:  The baker has made 19 kuchens and 131gebäckstückes. If he sells 70 kuchen and 88gebäckstückes, then we have to subtract the number of kuchen sold from the total number of kuchen made. So, the remaining kuchen are equal to 19 - 70 = -51 kuchen. Now, let's find out how many more gebäckstückes than kuchen the baker has made. We can do this by subtracting the number of gebäckstückes sold from the total number of gebäckstückes made. So, the remaining gebäckstückes are equal to 131 - 88 = 43gebäckstückes. Therefore, the baker has made more than twice as manygebäckstückes as kuchen.
Response:  The baker has made 157 kuchens and 169 pieces of cake. If he sells 158 kuchens and 147 pieces of cake, then he must have more kuchens than cakes sold. So, the number of kuchens that the baker has sold is greater than the number of cakes sold. Therefore, the answer is 157 - 147 = 10.
Response:  The baker has made 54 kuchens and 143gebäckstückes. If he sells 68 kuchen and 92gebäckstückes, then we can calculate how many more gebackstückes he sold than kuchen as follows: Number of Gebäckstücke sold = Total number of Gebäckstücke - Number of Gebäckstücke made = 92 - 143 = -51 Gebäckstücke. So, the baker sold 51 more Gebäckstücke than Kuchen.
Response:  If the baker had initially made 48 kuchens and sold 44 of them, then he must have had 4 - 44 = 38 kuchens left over. So, the baker has 38 kuchens still left.
Response:  If the baker has sold 8 kuchens and initially made 40 kuchens, then he must have made more than 8 - 4 = 4 additional kuchens. So, the baker has made 4 + 40 = 44 kuchens in total.
"Response:  If the friend of the baker had bought 137 kuchens from him and initially the baker had made 169 kuchens, then we can calculate how many kuchens the baker still has as follows:

Initially, the baker had 169 kuchens.
The friend bought 137 kuchens from the baker.
So, the number of kuchens the baker still has is:
169 - 137 = 32
Therefore, the baker still has 32 kuchens."
Response:  The baker has made 173 kuchens and bought 103 new ones, so he now has 173 + 103 = 276 kuchens. Then, he sold 86 kuchens, leaving him with 276 - 86 = 190 kuchens. Therefore, the baker still has 190 kuchens.
Response:  The baker has 99 kuchens made and 167 new ones bought. So he has 99 + 167 = 266 kuchens in total. Then, he sold 89 of them. Therefore, the number of kuchens the baker has more than he sold is:  266 - 89 = 177 kuchens.
Response:  The baker has made 8 kuchens and bought 139 new ones. So he has (8 + 139) = 147 kuchens in total. He sold 145 kuchens, so he has (145 - 147) = -2 kuchens more than he bought. Therefore, the baker has -2 kuchens more than he bought.
Response:  The baker had initially made 62 kuchens and then made additional 149 kuchens for a total of 211 kuchens (initial + additional). Since he sold 144 kuchens, that means he has 70 kuchens left (total - sold = remaining). So, the baker has 70 kuchens left.
Response:  The baker has made a total of 81 + 92 = 173 kuchens. He sold 46 of them, so he has 173 - 46 = 127 kuchens left. Therefore, the baker has more kuchens than he sold.
Response:  The baker has initially made 167 kuchens and 61gebäckstückes. If he sells 108 kuchen and 44gebäckstückes, then we subtract these amounts from his initial total to find out how many kuchen the baker still has. So, the number of kuchen the baker still has is: 167 - 108 = 59.
Response:  The baker has initially 56 Gebäckstücke and 124 Kuchen, so he has in total 180 (56 + 124) items. If he sells 104 Kuchen and 29 Gebäckstücke, then he will have left with 180 - (104 + 29) = 180 - 133 = 47 Gebäckstücke. So, the baker still has 47 Gebäckstücke.
Response:  The baker has 52 Gebäckstücke and 84 Kuchen. If he sells 102 Kuchen and 94 Gebäckstücke, then... (1)...the number of kuchens sold is equal to the total number of kuchens plus the number of gebackstues sold minus the number of kuchens the baker had initially. So we can write this equation: 102 = 52 + (94 - 84)...(2)...Now let's solve for the difference between the number of kuchens the baker made and the number ofgebäckstückes he had: 52 = 94 - 84...(3)...So the baker made 10 more kuchens than he had initialy. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  The baker has made 134 pieces of bread and 11 cakes. If he sells 140 cakes and 92 pieces of bread, then... (140 - 11 = 129)...he must have sold 129 pieces of bread. So, the number of pieces of bread that the baker has more than cakes is 129 - 11 = 118.
Response:  The baker has made 14 kuchens and 153 pieces of cake. If he sells 8 pieces of cake and 97 kuchens, then he must have sold more kuchens than cakes. So, the number of kuchens that the baker has sold is equal to 97 - 8 = 90. Therefore, the baker has sold 90 kuchens more than the number of cakes he has sold.
Response:  The baker has made 43 kuchens and 114 pieces of cake. If he sells 154 pieces of cake and 78 kuchens, then... (114 + 78) = 192 total items sold. So, the number of pieces of cake sold is 154 - 78 = 76 more than the number of kuchens sold. Therefore, the baker has sold 76 more pieces of cake than kuchens.
"Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games and she wants to have 140 games left after buying some more, we can calculate it as follows:

Number of games Kelly has = 22
Number of games Kelly needs to buy = 140 - 22 = 118

So, Kelly needs to buy 118 Nintendo games to have 140 games left after that."
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and gives away 64 of them, then she will have... (106 - 64) = 42 games left.
Response:  Kelly had initially 91 games if she gave away one game. So, she must have had 92 games originally (91 - 1 = 92).
Response:  Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away in order to have 12 left, we can divide her total number of games (20 + 70 = 90) by 12. So, Kelly needs to give away 7 Nintendo games (90 / 12 = 7).
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to give away so that she still has 31 Sony games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has from 31. So, Kelly needs to give away 100 (31 - 132) Sony games.
Response:  Kelly has 80 Nintendo games in total and she found additional 31 games. So, her new total number of games is 80 + 31 = 111. To find out how many games she must give away to have 6 remaining, we can divide the total number of games by 6: 111 / 6 = 18. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 18 games to have 6 remaining.
Response:  If Randy has x blocks at the beginning and builds a tower using 52 of them, then he will have 52 - x blocks left over after building the tower. Since there are still 38 blocks left over, we can set up the equation: 52 = x + 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. So, Randy had 14 blocks at the beginning.
Response:  If Randy has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower, then he will have less than 97 blocks left after building the tower. We can assume that he used x blocks to build the tower, since we know that there are still 72 blocks left after building the tower. So, we can write an equation: 97 - x = 72. To find out how many blocks Randy used to build the tower, we need to solve this equation for x. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 25. Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  If Randy has 79 blocks and uses 14 to build a tower, he will have 65 blocks left (79 - 14 = 65). Then, if he uses 11 blocks to build a house, he will have 54 blocks left (65 - 11 = 54). So, there are 54 blocks remaining after building both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randy used 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So he has used in total 27 + 53 = 80 blocks.
"Response:  Randy used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So he has used more blocks for the tower than for the house. To find out how many blocks he used more for the tower, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used for the tower:

33 - 13 = 20

So Randy used 20 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house."
Response:  Randy used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So he has used more blocks (82 - 79 = 3) to build the house than he did for the tower. Therefore, Randy has used 3 more blocks to build the house than he did for the tower.
"Response:  If Randy has 59 blocks and he uses 36 of them to build a tower, then how many blocks are left? We can calculate this as follows:

Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower
= 59 - 36
= 23

Therefore, there are 23 blocks left over if Randy has 59 blocks and he uses 36 of them to build a tower."
Response:  Randy used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So he has used more blocks for the tower than for the house. Therefore, Randy has used 30 blocks (50 - 20) more to build the tower than to build the house.
Response:  Randy used 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower. So he has used more blocks for building the house than for building the tower. Therefore, Randy has used 26 (89 - 63) more blocks to build the house than to build the tower.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series ""Crazy Funny School"" and we have not read 5 of them yet. So, if we subtract 5 from 20, we get 15. Therefore, we have already read 15 books in the series."
"Response:  If you have read 13 books from the series and still have 8 to read, that means there are 21 books in total in the series (13 + 8 = 21). Therefore, there are 21 books in the ""Verruckte dumme Schule"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 films in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 12 of the books, then we can say that you still need to read 9 more books (22 - 12 = 9).
Response:  We know that there are 17 films and we have seen 7 of them. So, to find out how many more movies we need to see, we can subtract the number of movies we have already seen from the total number of movies. Therefore, the answer is: 17 - 7 = 10.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 19 of the books and seen 13 of the movies, we can deduce that there are more books than movies in the series as follows:
Number of Books = Total Number of Books - Number of Books You Have Read
= 16 - 19
= -3
Therefore, there are 3 more books than movies in the Crazy Silly School series."
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have read 19 of the books and seen 61 of the movies, we can deduce that there are more movies than books in the series because you have watched more movies than you have read books. So, the number of movies exceeds the number of books by at least 40 (61 - 19 = 42). Therefore, there are at least 40 more movies than books in the series Crazy Silly School.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If we have read 13 books, then we have seen 12 + 13 = 25 films. So, we have read more books than films."
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 films in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If we have read 7 of the books, then the number of books left to read is 11 - 7 = 4. Similarly, if we have watched 21 of the films, then the number of films left to watch is 17 - 21 = -6 (since negative numbers indicate more than the total number). Therefore, we have watched more films than books. The difference between the number of films watched and books read is 21 - 7 = 14. So, we have watched 14 more films than books.
"Response:  If there are 8 books you have already read and there are 14 books in total in the series, then we can calculate the number of books left to be read as follows:
Number of books left to be read = Total number of books - Number of books read
= 14 - 8
= 6
So, you still need to read 6 more books from the series ""Verruckte dumme Schule""."
Response:  We know that there are 62 films and 19 books in the series. If you have seen 34 movies and read 4 books, then we can calculate how many books you still need to read as follows: Number of books left = Total number of books - Number of books already read = 62 - 4 = 58 So, you still need to read 58 books from the series.
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series. If you have read 7 books, then we can say that you have not seen any of the movies yet because reading books does not involve watching movies. So, to find out how many movies you need to watch, we can subtract the number of books you have read from the total number of movies: 8 - 7 = 1. Therefore, you still need to watch one movie.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books read and 40 movies seen. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of books > Number of movies

We also know that there are 14 films and 15 books in the series. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

14 (films) + 15 (books) =?

Now, let's substitute the values we have obtained from the previous equations:

14 x + 15 = 11 x + 40

Solving for X, we get:

X = 29

So, there are 29 more books than movies in the Crazy Silly School series."
Response:  We know that there are 17 films and 11 books in the series Crazy Silly School. If you have seen 63 movies and read 13 books, we can deduce that there are more movies than books in the series. Specifically, there are 50 movies (63 - 13 = 50) more than books in the series Crazy Silly School.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School"". If we assume that you have read 14 of the films and 19 of the books, then we can calculate how many more books you have read as follows:

Number of books read = Number of books - Number of films watched
= 19 - 14
= 5

Therefore, you have read 5 more books than films in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 films in the series ""Crazy Silly School."" If you have read 19 movies and seen 16 books, we can determine how many more movies than books you have watched as follows:
Number of movies more than books = Number of movies - Number of books
= 19 - 16
= 3
Therefore, you have watched 3 more movies than books in the series ""Crazy Silly School."""
Response:  If Dave has 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys, then he must have used x number of tickets to do so. Since he still has 2 tickets left, we can write an equation as follows: 7 - x = 2. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: x = 4. So, Dave used 4 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave has used 12 tickets to buy some toys and he still has 14 tickets left, that means he had a total of 12 + 14 = 26 tickets in the game room at first. So, Dave has won 26 - 12 = 14 tickets in the game room.
Response:  If Dave had 18 tickets to start with and he used 5 for game prizes, then he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left. Then, if he used another 11 tickets for clothing, he would have 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left. So, Dave has 2 tickets remaining.
Response:  If Dave has won 19 tickets and he used 12 for toys and 7 more for clothes, then he has 19 - 12 = 7 tickets left over for clothes. So, Dave has used more tickets for toys than for clothes.
Response:  If Dave has won 13 tickets and he uses 8 of them for toys, then he has 5 tickets left (13 - 8 = 5). Now, if he uses 18 more tickets for clothes than he used for toys, that means he has spent 18 / 2 = 9 tickets on clothes. So, Dave has 5 - 9 = 6 tickets left after buying clothes. Therefore, Dave has used more tickets for clothes than for toys.
Response:  We know that Dave has won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. Then we are told that he used 10 tickets for toys, which means he has 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  We know that Haley had planted 14 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, 9 of them died. So, we have to find out how many trees survived the typhoon. To do this, we can divide the number of trees that did not die (14 - 9 = 5) by the total number of trees planted (14). Therefore, 5 more trees survived than died in the typhoon.
Response:  We know that Haley has planted 13 trees and after the typhoon, 6 have died. So, the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, 7 trees have survived the typhoon.
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 trees planted in her backyard initially. After the storm (taifun), only 4 trees were left standing. So, we can calculate the number of trees that died as follows: Number of trees that died = Total number of trees - Number of trees remaining after the storm = 20 - 4 = 16 trees died in the storm.
Response:  If Haley has planted x trees and after the typhoon, 5 trees are dead, then the number of surviving trees is x - 5 = 7. So, Haley has planted 7 trees.
"Response: 
Haley had 9 trees initially. After the storm, 4 died, leaving her with 9 - 4 = 5 remaining trees. Then she planted 5 more trees, so now she has 5 + 5 = 10 trees in total. Therefore, Haley still has 10 trees in her backyard."
Response:  At first, Haley had 12 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, two of them died. So, she has 12 - 2 = 10 trees left. Therefore, Haley still has 10 trees in her backyard.
Response:  If Haley initially planted 3 trees and then after the typhoon, 13 trees died in the backyard, that means there are now more dead trees than surviving ones. So, we can say that 10 (13 - 3) trees have died due to the typhoon.
Response:  At first, Haley had 11 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, 2 of them died. So, if we subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees, we get the number of surviving trees. Therefore, 8 trees have survived the typhoon (11 - 2 = 8).
Response:  If they harvest 66 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 28 oranges, then... (1)...they harvest 66 x 28 = 1804 oranges per day.
Response:  If they can harvest 8 sacks per day, then to get 24 sacks of oranges, it will take them... (do calculation)...days!
"Response:  If they will take 4 days to harvest all the oranges and they have already gathered 56 sacks of oranges, then we can calculate how many sacks they gather per day as follows:

Number of sacks per day = Total number of sacks / Number of days it takes to harvest them
= 56 / 4
= 14

So, they gather 14 sacks of oranges per day."
"Response:  If they can harvest 38 sacks per day and each sack contains 42 oranges, then after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected __________ sacks of oranges. 

Please provide your answer in the format of a numerical value (e.g., 100)."
"Response:  The farmer harvests 66 bags of oranges per day, and each bag contains 25 oranges. Therefore, after 87 days (the number of days the farmer went to see how the oranges were being picked), they will have harvested a total of:

66 bags/day x 87 days = 5,730 bags

So, after 87 days, they will have harvested a total of 5,730 bags of oranges, which means they will have collected 143,500 oranges (since each bag contains 25 oranges)."
Response:  If they harvest 8 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 35 oranges, then... (1)...the total number of oranges harvested per day is 8 x 35 = 280 oranges. So, they harvest 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they can harvest 16 sacks per day and each sack contains 57 oranges, then they will need 80 sacks to gather 80 oranges. Therefore, it will take them 80/16 = 5 days to collect 80 sacks of oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 67 sacks of oranges per day and each sack contains 12 oranges, then the total number of oranges harvested daily is 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. Now, if they plan to harvest 35 sacks of oranges in total, then the total number of oranges they will harvest is 35 x 12 = 420 oranges. So, the answer is 420 oranges.
Response:  The farmer harvests 74 sacks of oranges per day and throws away 71 of them. This means that after 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 74 x 51 = 3690 sacks of oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 76 sacks of oranges per day and discard 64 of them, that means they have 12 sacks of oranges left (76 - 64 = 12). Since each sack contains 50 oranges, they harvest 12 x 50 = 600 oranges per day.
"Response:  If they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day, then after 26 days, they will have collected a total of:

Ripe oranges = 28 x 26 = 704 sacks
Unripe oranges = 52 x 26 = 1328 sacks

So, in total, they will have 2032 sacks of oranges after 26 days (704 + 1328)."
Response:  If they harvest 82 sacks of ripe oranges and 61 sacks of unripe oranges per day, then after 25 days, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 sacks of ripe oranges and 61 x 25 = 1525 sacks of unripe oranges. So, in total, they will have 3575 sacks of oranges after 25 days.
Response:  If they harvest 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day and it takes 45 days to ripen, then after 45 days they will have... (do calculations)...unripe oranges.
Response:  We know that total number of oranges harvested per day is 79 (44 + 35). Now we need to find out how many sacks of ripe oranges are harvested compared to unripe ones. According to the question, 44 sacks of ripe oranges and 25 sacks of unripe oranges are harvested per day. So, the ratio of ripe to unripe oranges is 44/25 = 1.76. This means that for every one sack of unripe oranges, there are almost 1.8 sacks of ripe oranges being harvested. Therefore, the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day is (1.8 x 25) = 45 sacks.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges and 74 sacks of unripe oranges per day. So, we can write this as:

Ripe oranges = 5 sacks/day
Unripe oranges = 74 sacks/day - 5 sacks/day = 69 sacks/day

Now, let's find out how many more unripe oranges are being harvested than ripe ones:

More unripe oranges = 69 sacks/day - 5 sacks/day = 64 sacks/day

So, there are 64 sacks of unripe oranges harvested every day more than the number of ripe oranges."
Response:  If they harvested 54 sacks of oranges in total and they harvested 18 sacks per day, then it took them... (do calculations)...days to harvest all those oranges.
"Response:  If they harvested oranges for 14 days, then they must have harvested x number of sacks per day. Since they collected 56 sacks in total, we can write an equation as follows:
x × 14 = 56
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to get the value of x:
x = 4
So, they collected 4 sacks of oranges per day."
"Response:  If they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day and it takes 73 days to harvest all the oranges, then after 73 days they will have:

5 sacks/day x 73 days = 365 sacks (of ripe oranges)

So, after 73 days, they will have 365 sacks of ripe oranges."
"Response:  If they harvest 65 sacks of immature oranges per day and it takes 6 days to mature, then after 6 days they will have... (1)

Please provide your answer in the format of a mathematical equation."
Response:  We know that in total they harvest 497 sacks of oranges per day (41 + 86 = 497). Now we want to find out how many sacks of ripe oranges are harvested compared to immature ones. So let's divide the number of sacks of ripe oranges (86) by the total number of sacks harvested (497): 86 / 497 = 0.173. This means that for every 5 sacks of oranges harvested, one is immature and four are ripe. Therefore, for every 5 days, they harvest 205 sacks of ripe oranges (4 x 5 = 20) and 192 sacks of immature oranges (5 x 38 = 192).
"Response:  According to the problem statement, they harvest 71 sacks of immature oranges and 60 sacks of mature oranges per day. To find out how many more immature oranges are harvested than mature ones, we need to subtract the number of mature oranges from the total number of oranges harvested. So, the difference between the two numbers is:

71 - 60 = 11
Therefore, every day, 11 more sacks of immature oranges are harvested than mature oranges."
Response:  Length of Jesse's room = 12 feet Longitude of Jesse's room = 11 feet Now we can calculate how much longer her room is than wide: Room length - Room width = 12 - 11 = 1 foot So, Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is broad.
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 7 feet long (length = 7). The carpet needs to cover an area of 14 square feet (area = 14). Since one foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert the length from feet to inches as follows: length in inches = 7 x 12 = 84 inches. Now, we need to divide the area required for the carpet by the length of the room to find out how wide the room is: width = area / length = 14 / 84 = 1 1/3 feet or approximately 1.67 feet. Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 1.67 feet wide.
"Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 7 feet wide (breit). A square foot is equal to 12 inches, so we can convert the width of her room from feet to inches as follows:

7 ft = 84 in (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Now, let's find out how many square feet make up Jesse's room:

84 in x 14 ft = 1156 sq in (since there are 14 square feet in 1 square foot)
So, Jesse's room has an area of 1156 square inches. To find its length, we need to divide the area by the width:

1156 sq in / 84 in = 13.75 ft (round this value to the nearest whole number)
Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 13.75 feet long."
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 11 feet long and its width is 15 feet wide. So, we have to find out how many square feet are needed to cover the entire floor area. We know that she already has 16 square feet of carpet, so let's subtract this from the total area of the room to find out how much more carpet she needs. Therefore, the number of additional square feet of carpet required = Total Area - Already Covered Area = 230 Square Feet (Total Area = Length x Width) = 11 x 15 = 165 Square Feet (Already Covered Area = 16 Square Feet). So, Jessie needs an additional 89 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor area.
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, which means it has an area of 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Since each tile covers 4 square feet, we need to divide the total area of the room by 4 to find out how many tiles she needs: 24 / 4 = 6. Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of each room is 19 feet and the width is 18 feet, so the area of one room is 19 x 18 = 342 square feet. Since there are 20 rooms in total, the total area of all the rooms is 342 x 20 = 6,840 square feet. To cover the entire floor with carpeting, they will need 6,840 / 9 (the number of square feet in a square yard) = approximately 756 square yards of carpeting.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 20 feet and its width as 19 feet. To find out how much longer her room is than wide, we need to subtract the width from the length: 20 - 19 = 1 foot. So, Jesse's room is one foot longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since we are given that the room is 5 feet long, we can find its width as follows: Width = Length / 2 = 5 ft / 2 = 2.5 ft Therefore, Jesse's room is 2.5 feet wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a carpet with an area of 10 square feet to cover her room. Since we are given that the room is 2 feet wide, we can calculate its length as follows: Length = Area / Width = 10 sq ft / 2 ft = 5 ft Therefore, Jesse's room is 5 feet long.
Response:  The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so it has an area of 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet, he needs more to cover the entire floor. To find out how much more, we divide the area of the room by the area of the carpet: 80 / 18 = 4.44 times as much carpet. So, Jesse needs 4.44 times 18 = 79.68 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Das Razorback T-Shirt-Geschaft earned $23 per sold t-shirt. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they earned $230 through t-shirt sales. To find out how many t-shirts were sold, we can divide the amount earned by the profit per t-shirt: $230 / $23 = 9.6 t-shirts. So, Das Razorback T-Shirt-Geschaft sold approximately 10 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  If the shop has earned $51 during the game, and it sold 3 T-shirts, then each T-shirt must have cost at least $17 (since $51 / 3 = $17).
Response:  The business sells $87 per t-shirt. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then their total revenue from those sales would be: 47 x $87 = $4063.
"Response:  If they sold 106 t-shirts per game and they had 242 total sales during both games, then...
They sold 130 t-shirts during the Arkansas game (242 - 115 = 130).
And they sold 132 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game (106 x 2 = 212, subtracting the number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game gives us 132)."
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold during both games is given as 163. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the remaining t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game are 74 (163 - 89). So, the revenue earned from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is 89 x $98 = $85.20. Therefore, the amount of money earned with the sale of t-shirts during the Arkansas game is $85.20.
Response:  If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and earned $78 per t-shirt, then their total earnings from that game were $78 x 172 = $13,040. Now, if they sold an additional 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game (as stated in the question), then their total earnings for both games would be $13,040 + ($78 x 14) = $13,040 + $1,095 = $14,135. So, they earned $14,135 through the sale of t-shirts during the two games.
"Response:  The shop sells $62 per t-shirt and $99 per jersey. They sold 183 t-shirts and 31 jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So, they earned total revenue of:
$62 x 183 = $11,546 from t-shirts
$99 x 31 = $3,079 from jerseys
Total revenue = $11,546 + $3,079 = $14,625"
"Response:  We know that Der Razorback Shop sells T-shirts for $67 each and jerseys for $165 each. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jerseys. To find out how much money the shop made from these sales, we can multiply the number of items sold by their prices:
T-shirts: 74 x $67 = $4,898
Jerseys: 156 x $165 = $25,340
So, the total amount of money the shop made through these sales is $29,238."
Response:  According to the problem statement, The Razorback Shop earned $192 per T-shirt and $34 per jersey. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jerseys. To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to subtract the price of a jersey from the price of a T-shirt. So, let's do that: $192 - $34 = $158. Therefore, one T-shirt costs $158 more than one jersey.
Response:  According to the passage, Der Razorback Shop earned $86 per T-shirt and $232 per jersey during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. They sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys during the game. To find out how much more expensive a jersey is than a T-shirt, we can subtract the price of a T-shirt from the price of a jersey: $232 - $86 = $146. Therefore, a jersey costs $146 more than a T-shirt.
Response:  The original price of each t-shirt is $51. During the game, they offered a discount of $8 per t-shirt, which means that the new price was $43 ($51 - $8). They sold 130 t-shirts during the game. So, their total revenue from selling t-shirts can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts Sold x Price of Each T-Shirt Total Revenue = 130 x $43 Total Revenue = $5270
Response:  The original price of each t-shirt is $201. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they increased the price per t-shirt by $217, so the new price per t-shirt is $418 ($201 + $217). If they sold 14 t-shirts during this time period, their total revenue from those sales can be calculated as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts Sold x New Price Per T-Shirt Total Revenue = 14 x $418 Total Revenue = $5,968 So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $5,968 in revenue from selling 14 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
"Response:  We know that during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop earned $60 through the sale of T-shirts. If they make $10 per sold T-shirt, then we can find out how many T-shirts they have sold as follows:

$60 / $10 = 6

So, the Razorback T-Shirt Shop has sold 6 T-shirts during the game."
"Response:  If the shop sold 5 T-shirts and earned $215 from them, then we can calculate how much each T-shirt costs as follows:

$215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt
Therefore, each T-shirt costs $43."
Response:  According to the problem statement, The Razorback Shop earned $5 per jersey and $215 per t-shirt during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. They sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys during the game. So, they have earned total revenue of $215 x 20 = $4300 from t-shirts and $5 x 64 = $3200 from jerseys. Therefore, the total amount of money that The Razorback Shop has earned through the sale of these items is $4300 + $3200 = $7500.
Response:  The shop sells $ 76 per jersey and $ 204 per t-shirt. They sold 2 jerseys and 158 t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. So they earned $ 76 x 2 = $ 152 from jerseys and $ 204 x 158 = $ 31,920 from t-shirts. Therefore, they have earned a total of $ 31,920 + $ 152 = $ 32,072 through the sale of these items.
Response:  According to the problem statement, the shop earned $210 per jersey and $240 per t-shirt during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech. We know that they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys during this time period. To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we can subtract the price of a t-shirt from the price of a jersey. So, if a jersey costs $210 and a t-shirt costs $240, then the difference between the two is: $240 - $210 = $30. Therefore, one t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.
"Response:  We know that Der Razorback Shop earned $ 115 per jersey and $ 25 per t-shirt. The total number of shirts sold during the game was 113, and the total number of jerseys sold was 78. So we can calculate the cost of each item as follows:
T-shirt price = Total revenue from t-shirts / Number of t-shirts sold = $ 25 x 113 = $ 2,775
Jersey price = Total revenue from jerseys / Number of jerseys sold = $ 115 x 78 = $ 9,060
Therefore, a jersey costs $ 9,060 - $ 2,775 = $ 6,285 more than a t-shirt."
Response:  We know that they have 5 tray sets and each set has 10 chairs. So, we can write this as an equation: 5T = 10C. Now, we need to find out how many chairs are there more than tables. To do this, we will subtract the number of chairs from the total number of seats. Therefore, the answer is C > T.
Response:  We know that there are 12 stools in total and we have 2 tables with an equal number of chairs. So, each table has 6 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6).
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in total in the backyard. Since each table has 3 chairs, we can deduce that there are 9 / 3 = 3 tables in the backyard. Therefore, they have 3 tray sets.
Response:  We know that they have 11 tray sets and each set has 13 chairs. So, we can write this as an equation: 11x = 13y, where x is the number of tray sets and y is the number of chairs. Now, we are asked to find out how many stools they have in the backyard. Therefore, we need to solve for y in the above equation. Solving for y gives us y = 130. So, there are 130 chairs in the backyard.
Response:  We have 10 tray sets and each set has 6 chairs. If we add 11 people who want to sit on stools, then there will be no seats left for anyone else. So, all 60 chairs (10 x 6) are occupied, leaving none unoccupied. Therefore, 0 chairs remain unoccupied.
Response:  They have 12 table sets and each set has 14 chairs, so they have 12 x 14 = 168 chairs total. Then, there are 6 additional chairs, making the total number of chairs for the guests 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  We have 4 table sets and each set has 3 chairs. So, we have 4 x 3 = 12 chairs already available. Since there will be 14 participants, we need to buy additional chairs for the remaining 2 participants. Therefore, we need to buy 2 more chairs.
"Response:  We know that they have more stools than tables because we are told that ""they have 14 chairs for each table"". So if they have 9 table sets, then they must have 14 x 9 = 126 chairs. Therefore, they have 126 - 9 = 117 stools more than tables."
Response:  If Lewis earns $460 in total during 5 weeks, he earned an average of $92 per week (460 / 5 = 92).
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned $1216 during the harvest. If he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to earn this amount as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
So, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks = $4532 (rounded)
He has to pay $702 in taxes, so he will have $3830 left ($4532 - $702)."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $1357 per week during each of the 223 weeks of harvest season, he will have earned a total of:

$1357 x 223 = $294,063

So, if he works for 73 harvest seasons, his total earnings would be:

$294,063 x 73 = $20,873,910"
"Response:  During the harvest season (109 weeks), Lewis earns $28 per week. If he works overtime every week, he earns an additional $939 per week. Therefore, his total weekly income during the harvest season is:

$28 x 109 = $2,872

So, during the harvest season, Lewis earns a total of $2,872."
"Response: 
Lewis earns $403 per week during the harvest season, which lasts for 23 weeks. Therefore, he earns a total of:
$403 x 23 = $9,190 during the harvest season.
However, he also pays $49 in rent every week, so his total income minus rent is:
$9,190 - ($49 x 23) = $8,752 during the harvest season."
Response:  If he earns $368 per week during the harvest season and pays $388 in rent every week, then...
"Response: 
Lewis earns $491 per week during the 1181 weeks of harvest. He has to pay $216 in rent every week as well. So, his total income for each week is $491 - $216 = $275.
Since he works for 1181 weeks, his total income over that period is:
$275 x 1181 = $309,775
Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $309,775."
Response:  We know that Lewis has worked for 19 weeks and earned $133 in total. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide his total earnings by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest, he will have earned a total of $2 x 178 = $356 in 178 weeks. So, the harvest lasted for approximately 178 weeks.
"Response:  If Dean is 9 feet tall (or 9 x 3 = 27 feet long), and the water depth is 10 times his height, then...
The correct answer is 270 feet deep."
Response:  We know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron is 14 feet tall, then Dean is 6 feet (14 - 8) tall. The water is twice as deep as Dean, so it is 12 feet deep (2 x 6). Since we also know that Dean and Ron are swimming together, the total depth of the water they are in is equal to the sum of their heights plus the depth of the water. Therefore, the answer is 12 + 6 = 18 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, so if Ron is at a height of 12 feet above sea level, then Dean will be at a height of 12 - 11 = 1 foot below sea level. Since we are given that the depth of the water is five times Ron's height, and Ron is currently at a height of 12 feet, then the depth of the water would be 5 x 12 = 60 feet deep.
Response:  We know that Dean is 4 feet (or 48 inches) bigger than Ron. So if Ron is at a depth of 13 feet, then Dean will be at a depth of 13 + 4 = 17 feet. Since the water is 15 times deeper than Dean's size, we can say that the water is 15 x 17 = 255 feet deep. Therefore, the answer to the question is 255 feet.
Response:  We know that after they rested, they decided to go swimming. The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's size. So if Ron is 9 feet tall, then the depth of the water would be 16 x 9 = 144 feet deep. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, he would need to add an additional 9 feet to this height, making it 233 feet deep. Therefore, when Ron was standing at 13 feet, the water was 233 - 13 = 220 feet deep.
Response:  If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than him (Ron), then we can say that Dean is 9 feet shorter than Ron. Now, if they decide to swim in water with a depth of 9 times their height, then the water will be 9 x 15 = 135 feet deep for Ron and 9 x 6 = 54 feet deep for Dean. So, the water was 135 feet deep for Ron and 54 feet deep for Dean.
Response:  If Bryan has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among 2 bookshelves, then each shelf will have 17 books (34 / 2 = 17).
Response:  If Bryan has 42 books in total and each bookshelf can hold 2 books, then he must have __________ bookshelves. (Here, we are using the information given in the question to find out how many bookshelves Bryan has.) So, the answer is 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves.
"Response:  If Bryan has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

27 x 23 = 611 books
80 x 23 = 1840 magazines
So, Bryan has a total of 611 books and 1840 magazines."
Response:  If Bryan has 9 books and 46 magazines in each of his 10 bookshelves, then he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 books. And if he has 46 magazines per shelf, then he has a total of 46 x 10 = 460 magazines overall. So, Bryan has altogether 90 + 460 = 550 publications.
"Response:  If Bryan has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

23 x 29 = 647 books
61 x 29 = 1759 magazines
Therefore, Bryan has a total of 647 books and 1759 magazines."
Response:  We know that Bryan has 7 bookshelves and each shelf has the same number of books. So, if we divide the total number of books (28) by the number of shelves (7), we get the average number of books per shelf: 28 / 7 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 books in each bookshelf.
Response:  If Bryan has 38 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he must have 19 bookshelves (38 / 2 = 19).
Response:  If Carol sends out invitations to 10 friends and each package contains 2 invitations, then she needs to send packages to 5 friends (since 10 / 2 = 5). So, no friend will be left behind.
Response:  If Carol has sent out birthday invitations to 12 friends and she bought 3 packages of invitations, then each package must contain at least 12 / 3 = 4 invitations. So there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  If Carol has bought 7 packages of invitations and each package contains 10 invitations, then she has purchased a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. If she sends only 2 invitations to her friends, then the number of invitations left over is 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  If Carol has bought 6 packages of invitations each containing 14 invitations, then she has purchased in total 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, if she has also bought additional 11 invitations, her total number of invitations is now 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Therefore, Carol can invite 95 friends to her party.
Response:  If Carol has bought two packages of invitations each containing 3 invitations, then she has purchased in total 6 x 3 = 18 invitations. To invite 9 friends, she needs to buy additional 9 - 18 = 10 invitations. Therefore, she must purchase 10 more invitations.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points in each game, then she scored a total of 36 points from playing x games. So, we can write an equation as follows: 36 = 12x. Now, to find out how many games Melissa played, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 12: x = 36/12. Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa played 3 games and scored altogether 81 points, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  If Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points, then her total score for one game is: Total score = 109 + 82 = 191 points. Now, if she played 79 games, her total score would be: Total score = 191 x 79 = 14,539 points.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored altogether 21 points and she scored 7 points per game. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game Now, we need to find out how many games Melissa played. To do this, we divide the total score by the score per game: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Melissa scored 91 points in total and she scored the same number of points in each game (which is given), then we can write an equation based on this information: x = y, where x represents the number of points Melissa scored in each game and y represents the total number of games played. Since there were 13 games played, we can substitute this value into our equation to solve for x: x = 91 / 13 = 7 points per game. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in each game.
Response:  The giant Ferris wheel in Paradise Park has 4 seats. If 20 people can ride at the same time, then each seat can hold how many people? We need to divide the total number of people who can ride (20) by the number of seats available per rotation (4). So, each seat can hold 5 people (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  The Riesenrad has some seats that can accommodate 9 people each. If simultaneously 18 people ride the Ferris wheel, then we need to divide the total number of passengers by the number of seats available per rotation. Therefore, the number of seats in the Ferris wheel is: 18 / 9 = 2 seats per rotation. So, the Ferris wheel has 2 x 45 = 90 seats in total.
Response:  Each Riesenrad has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, the total number of people that can ride in one Riesenrad is 19 x 15 = 285. To find out how many people can ride in 20 Riesenräder simultaneously, we need to divide the total number of people who can ride in one Riesenrad by the number of Riesenräder available: 285 / 20 = 14.25 people. So, approximately 14-15 people can ride in 20 Riesenrädr simultaneously.
"Response:  The Riesenrad has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken or damaged, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats available for passengers.
Total number of seats = Number of seats in the Riesenrad x Number of seats per seat
= 18 x 15
= 270 seats

So, if 10 seats are broken or damaged, there will be 270 - 10 = 260 seats available for passengers to ride the Riesenrad at the same time."
Response:  The Riesenrad has 6 seats and each seat can accommodate 14 people, so in total it can carry 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are already 16 people inside the Riesenrad, that means we have reached the maximum capacity of 84 people. Therefore, no more people can join the ride.
Response:  The total number of seats in the Ferris wheel is 2 + 23 = 25 seats. Since each small seat can accommodate 14 people, we have: Number of people who can ride the small seats = 25 / 14 = 180 people. Therefore, 180 people can ride on the small seats in the Ferris wheel.
Response:  The total number of seats in the giant seat is 7 and each big seat can accommodate 12 people, so the total number of people who can ride the giant seat is 7 x 12 = 84 people. Therefore, the answer to the question is 84 people.
Response:  If 16 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time and it has 4 seats per car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit in each seat. So, the answer is 4 persons per seat.
"Response:  If 4 people can ride at once and each seat in the Ferris wheel can hold 2 people, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many seats are available for riders. Since there are 4 people who can ride at once, we need to divide the total number of seats by 4. So, if each seat holds 2 people, then...
Seats per rider = Total seats / Number of riders = 8 seats / 4 riders = 2 seats per rider

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 8 seats in total, with 2 seats available for each of the 4 riders."
Response:  If there are 14 pieces of food in total and they were divided equally among 7 pizzas, then each pizza would have how many pieces of food? 14 / 7 = 2 pieces per pizza. So, there are 2 pieces of food in each pizza.
Response:  If there are 28 pieces in total and each pizza has 2 slices, then... (1 × 2 =) 2 pizzas have 4 slices each. So, you have ordered 2 pizzas.
Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. Therefore, we will get 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza in total. So there are 68 pizza slices altogether for 25 people.
Response:  If we have 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since we are two people, if we divide the total number of slices equally between us, each person will get 90/2 = 45 slices of pizza.
Response:  If Paige and her mother have planted some seeds together, then they must have divided them equally among the 45 flower beds. So, if they have 10 seeds per bed, then they have planted 10 x 45 = 450 seeds altogether.
"Response:  If Paige and her mother together have planted 45 seeds in 9 flower beds, then they must have planted an equal number of seeds in each flower bed. So, if x is the number of seeds planted in one flower bed, we can write the equation:
x = 45 / 9
Solving for x, we get:
x = 5
So, Paige and her mother planted 5 seeds in each of the 9 flower beds."
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 36 seeds. Since they only planted 12 seeds in each pot, we can conclude that there were 36/12 = 3 pots. Therefore, Paige and her mother had 3 Blumenbeeten (pots).
"Response:  We know that Paige and her mother together planted 55 seeds. Since they laid only 15 seeds in each pot, we can say that they have 4 pots (55 / 15 = 4). Now, we need to find out how many blossoms grew in each pot. According to the problem statement, ""only 60 blossoms grew in every pot."" So, the number of blossoms grown in each pot is 60. Therefore, the total number of blossoms grown by Paige and her mother is 4 x 60 = 240 blossoms."
Response:  We know that Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 6 flower beds. So, they planted a total of 60 seeds / 10 seeds per bed = 6 flower beds.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 32 seeds in total, that means they planted 4 seeds per beet (since there are 8 beets). So, Paige planted 4 seeds in each of the 8 beets.
Response:  If Matthew had 5 kekses and gave each of his 11 friends 2 kekses, then he would have given away 2 x 11 = 22 kekses in total. So, Matthew would be left with 5 - 22 = -17 kekses. Therefore, Matthew had -17 kekses.
Response:  If Matthew had 8 kekses and he gave each of his friends 2 kekses, then he gave away a total of 16 kekses (8 x 2 = 16). So, he has 8 - 16 = -8 kekses left for himself.
Response:  If Matthew had 15 crackers and gave them equally to his 5 friends, then each friend got 3 crackers (since 15 / 5 = 3). Now, if Matthew still has 10 crackers left after giving them away, that means he has 10 - 3 = 7 crackers left. So, each of Matthew's friends ate 3 + 7 = 10 crackers in total.
Response:  If Matthew had 24 crackers and gave them equally to his 3 friends, then each friend got 8 crackers (24 / 3 = 8). Since Matthew still has 17 crackers left after giving them away, that means he must have given 8 + 17 = 25 crackers in total to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cookies, that means he has a total of 56 snacks (22 + 34 = 56). Now, if he gave each of his 11 friends equal amounts of crackers and cookies, then each friend would have received 56 / 11 = 5 snacks. So, each person has eaten 5 crackers.
"Response:  If Matthew gave his friends equal amounts of crackers and cakes, then he must have given each friend x crackers and (x + 1) cakes. Since there are 30 cakes in total, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 1) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 1 = 30

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives us:

2x = 29

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 14

So, each friend ate 14 cakes."
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends equal amounts of cakes and cookies, then he must have given them 14/7 = 2 kekses and 21/7 = 3 cookies per friend. So each person has eaten 2 + 3 = 5 kekses and 3 + 3 = 6 cookies in total.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 18 friends an equal number of crackers, then he had to divide the total number of crackers equally among them. So if he had 36 crackers in total, and he divided them equally among his 18 friends, then each friend got 2 crackers (since 36 / 18 = 2). Therefore, each person ate 2 crackers.
"Response:  If Matthew gave each of his friends 6 kekses, and he had 36 kekses in total, then the number of friends he gave kekses to is:
36 / 6 = 6
So, Matthew gave kekses to 6 friends."
Response:  We know that Matthew had initially 23 crackers and he gave some to his friends. After giving them away, he has 11 crackers left. So, if he gave each friend an equal amount of crackers (which is what it says in the question), then the number of crackers each friend ate can be found by dividing the total number of crackers Matthew had originally by the number of friends he gave crackers to. In this case, we have: Number of crackers Matthews had = 23 Total number of friends = 2 Friends got an equal amount of crackers = 23 / 2 = 11 Therefore, each friend ate 11 crackers.
Response:  We know that Matthew had initially 31 crackers and he gave away some to his friends. After giving them away, he has 23 crackers left. So, if he gave each of his 5 friends an equal number of crackers (which is what the question states), then he must have given away 31 / 5 = 6 crackers to each friend. Therefore, the total number of crackers Matthew gave away to his friends is 6 x 5 = 30 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his four friends an equal number of crackers and cakes, then he had to divide the total amount equally among them. So if he initially had 32 crackers and 98 cakes, that means he had 32/4 = 8 crackers for each friend. Therefore, each person has eaten 8/4 = 2 crackers.
Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 4 friends an equal number of crackers and cookies, then he must have given them in total 4 x (10 + 8) = 4 x 18 = 72 crackers and cookies. Since each friend got an equal amount, they must have eaten half of what Matthew had initially, i.e., 5 crackers and 4 cookies each. So, the final number of crackers and cookies with which Matthew is left is 10 - 5 = 5 crackers and 8 - 4 = 4 cookies.
"Response:  If Matthew gave each of his 28 friends an equal number of crackers and cookies, then he must have had x crackers initially (since he had 13 at first). Similarly, if he gave each friend y cookies, then he must have had z cookies initially (since he had 15 at first). We can set up the equation:
x + y = 28... (1)
Since there are 28 people in total, including Matthew, we know that the sum of all the numbers is equal to 28:
x + y + z = 28... (2)
Now we can solve for x, y, and z using equations (1) and (2):
x = 13 - y/28... (3)
z = 15 - x/28... (4)
Substituting equation (3) into equation (4), we get:
z = 15 - (13 - y/28) / 28
Simplifying this expression, we get:
z = 15 - (y/28)
So, each person got y/28 cookies initially. Since Matthew did not give any cookies to himself, we know that y/28 represents the number of cookies each person received from Matthew. Therefore, the answer is y/28."
Response:  We know that Debby drank 109 water bottles per day and each bottle can hold 74 days of water. So, if she drank 109 bottles per day for 74 days, then she had drunk altogether 8266 bottles (109 x 74 = 8266). Therefore, she had bought 8266 water bottles.
"Response:  If Debby bought 153 water bottles and drank the same number every day for 17 days, she would have drunk:

153 x 17 = 2491 waters per day
Therefore, Debby drank 2491 waters per day."
Response:  We know that Debby bought 264 water bottles and she drank 15 per day for 11 days. So, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows: Number of bottles drunk = Total number of bottles x Number of days used = 264 x 11 = 2910 bottles Therefore, Debby has 2910 - 264 = 2648 bottles left.
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 301 water bottles and she drank some of them every day for several days. The number of bottles she drank per day is given as 144. So, we can write an equation:

Number of bottles drunk = Total number of bottles x Number of days drunk

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

144 = 301 x Days drunk

Now, we are asked to find out how many days Debby has drunk water. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 144:

Days drunk = 301 / 144

Therefore, Debby has drunk water for 2.06 days (or 2 days and 4 hours)."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 88 water bottles and 13 lemonade bottles. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 lemonade bottles per day, we can calculate how many days the water bottles will last as follows:

Days = Number of Water Bottles / Daily Consumption
= 88 / 4
= 22

Therefore, the water bottles will last for 22 days."
Response:  We know that Debby bought 256 Limonadenflaschen and she drinks 4 of them every day. To calculate how many days these will last her, we need to divide the number of Limonadenflaschen by the number of flaschen she drinks per day: 256 / 4 = 64 days. So, the Limonadenflaschen will last Debby for 64 days.
"Response:  If Debby drinks 6 bottles per day and has bought 12 water bottles in total, then she will have enough water for:

Days = Total amount of water / Amount of water consumed per day
= 12 bottles / 6 bottles per day
= 2 days

So, Debby would run out of water after 2 days."
"Response:  We know that Debby bought 95 Limonadenflaschen and 180 Wasserflaschen. If she drinks 15 Wasserflaschen and 54 Limonadenflaschen every day, we can calculate how many days the water bottles will last as follows:

Days = Number of Water Bottles / Daily Consumption
= 180 / 15
= 12 days

Therefore, the water bottles will last for 12 days."
Response:  We know that Debby bought 360 Limonadenflaschen and 162 Wasserflaschen in total. If she drinks 122 Wasserflaschen and 9 Limonadenflaschen every day, we can calculate how many days the Limonadenflaschen will last as follows: Number of days = Total number of Limonadenflaschen / Daily consumption of Limonadenflaschen = 360 / 9 = 40 days So, the Limonadenflaschen will last for approximately 40 days.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils in 14 rows with each row containing 11 pencils. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 14 x 11 = 154 pencils So, Faye has altogether 154 pencils.
Response:  If Faye has placed 12 pencils equally spaced out over 3 rows, then she must have placed 4 pencils in each row (since there are 3 rows). So, Faye has placed 4 x 4 = 16 pencils in total.
"Response:  We know that Faye has 28 packs of pencils and each pack contains 24 pencils. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
Number of packs = Number of rows x Number of pencils per pack
In this case, number of rows is equal to 16 (as given in the problem). So, we have: 
Number of rows = 16
Now, let's substitute the value of 'number of rows' into our first equation: 
Number of packs = 16 x 24
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
Number of packs = 384
Therefore, Faye could make 384 rows with her 28 packs of pencils."
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils in rows with 22 pencils each and she had 6 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 14 pencils. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row + Number of packs x Number of pencils per pack. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total number of pencils = 22 x 6 + 14 x 6 = 132 + 84 = 216 pencils. Therefore, Faye has altogether 216 pencils.
"Response:  We know that each row has 5 pencils and we have 35 pencils in total. So, to find out how many rows she can make, we divide 35 by 5:

35 / 5 = 7

So, Faye can make 7 rows of pencils."
"Response:  We know that there are 19 rows of sticks and each row has either 4 blue pencils or 2 red pencils. So, if we count all the blue pencils, we have:
4 + 4 + 4 +... + 4 = 36 blue pencils
And if we count all the red pencils, we have:
2 + 2 + 2 +... + 2 = 10 red pencils
So, altogether, Faye has 36 + 10 = 46 bleistifte (blue pencils)."
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed her blue pencils and colored pencils in 7 rows with each row containing 36 blue pencils and 30 colored pencils. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
Number of blue pencils = 7 x 36 = 252
Number of colored pencils = 7 x 30 = 210
So, Faye has 252 blue pencils and 210 colored pencils in total."
"Response:  We know that Faye has placed her 11 rows of bleistifs and buntstifts as follows:
Row 1: 31 bleistiften + 27 buntstiften = 58 sticks
Row 2: 31 bleistiften + 27 buntstiften = 58 sticks
... (repeating this for each row)
So, in total, Faye has 58 x 11 = 628 sticks of both bleistiften and buntstiften!"
Response:  If Faye has 30 pencils and wants to place them in rows of 5 each, she can make... (1)...rows. So, the answer is 6.
Response:  If Faye had 6 bleistifte and distributed them equally among 2 rows, then she has 3 bleistifte in each row. So, the number of bleistifte Faye has in each row is 3.
Response:  We know that Faye had 35 packs of pencils and each pack contained 4 pencils. So, she had a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pencils. Since she laid them out in rows with 2 pencils each, she could make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. Therefore, the correct answer is 70 rows.
Response:  We know that Faye had 31 packs of pencils and each pack contains 6 pencils. So, she has a total of 31 x 6 = 186 pencils.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 rows of sticks and each row has 71 bicolor pencils and 24 black pencils. Therefore, we have:
Total number of bicolor pencils = 71 x 30 = 2130
Total number of black pencils = 24 x 30 = 640
So, Faye has 2130 bicolor pencils and 640 black pencils in total."
Response:  We know that there are 16 rows of sticks and each row has 6 buntstift and 21 bleistift. So, total number of buntstift is 16 x 6 = 96. Therefore, Faye has 96 buntstift.
Response:  We know that there are 98 students in total and 7 school buses. Since each bus can seat at most 56 passengers (since there are 7 buses), we have: Number of seats = Total number of students / Number of buses x Capacity per bus = 98/7 x 56 = 304 seats So, there are 304 seats available for all 7 school buses combined.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each bus is full with 118 seats. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Total no. of classes = Number of classrooms x No. of students per classroom = 84 x? = 7068 (approximately) Therefore, there are approximately 7068 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms and each classroom has 66 students, so we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4282 students attending the school. Since each bus can seat 6 people, we need 4282 / 6 = 713 buses to transport all the students for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 713 buses.
"Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms and each classroom has an equal number of students (58). Therefore, we can assume that each bus will carry approximately half of the total number of students participating in the field trip. So, to calculate how many buses are needed, we need to divide the total number of students by two.
Therefore, the answer is: 4 buses."
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms and each classroom has an equal number of students. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 24 x 120 = 2880. Since there are 84 seats available on each bus, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus to find out how many students can go on each bus. So, the number of students who can go on each bus is 2880 / 84 = 35 students. Therefore, there are 35 students in each class.
Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students in total. If 22 students do not want to participate in the field trip, then the number of students who will go on the field trip is 102 - 22 = 80 students. Since each bus can seat 8 students, we need 80/8 = 10 buses for the field trip. Therefore, 10 buses will be needed to take all the students on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. If 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, then we subtract 8 from 11, which gives us 3. So, 3 students will be going on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 30 students (as assumed). So, the total number of students in the school is 72 x 30 = 2160 students. Since we have mentioned that every bus can accommodate 3 seats, we need to divide the total number of students by 3 to find out how many buses will be required for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 2160 / 3 = 72 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms and 92 students in total. Since each bus can carry a maximum of 50 students (as mentioned in the problem), we have: Number of buses = Total number of students / Capacity per bus = 92 students / 50 students/bus = 1.84 buses. Therefore, there will be approximately 1.84 buses for this school trip.
"Response:  If there are 11 boys in Haley's class who want to play marbles and Haley gives each boy 9 marbles, then...
Step 1: How many marbles does Haley have initially?
Haley has 9 marbles initially (since she is giving them away).
Step 2: How many marbles will each boy get from Haley?
Each boy will get 9 marbles from Haley.
Step 3: How many marbles will there be in total after Haley gives them away?
After Haley gives away 9 marbles to each of the 11 boys, there will be a total of 9 x 11 = 99 marbles."
"Response:  If Haley has 10 Murmeln and she gives each of the boys 5 Murmeln, then...

1. She gave 5 Murmeln to 5 boys (since there are 5 boys in total).
2. Therefore, she gave a total of 25 Murmeln to the boys (5 x 5 = 25).
3. So, Haley gave the Murmeln to 5 boys out of the total number of 10 Murmeln she had initially.

Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
Response:  If there are 4 boys in Haley's class and they want to share the 23 marbles equally among themselves, then each boy will get 6 marbles (23 / 4 = 6). However, if Haley wants to keep 15 marbles for herself, then each of the remaining 3 boys will get fewer marbles than before - 9 marbles each (23 - 15 = 9). Therefore, the final distribution is as follows: Haley gets 15 marbles, and each of the other 3 boys gets 9 marbles.
Response:  If there are 13 boys who like to play marbles and they want to share equally among themselves, then each boy will get 26/13 = 2 marbles. Similarly, if there are 50 boys who like to play cards and they also want to share equally among themselves, then each boy will get 26/50 = 1 card.
Response:  If Haley has 20 marbles and there are 2 boys in her class who want to play with them equally, then we need to divide 20 by 2 = 10. So each boy will get 5 marbles (20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If Haley has 28 Murmeln and gives each of the boys 2 Murmeln, then she gave away a total of 2 x 5 = 10 Murmeln. So, there are 28 - 10 = 18 Murmeln left with Haley. Therefore, she gave the Murmels to 3 boys (since 18 / 3 = 6).
"Response:  If Frank reads 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages, he will need x days to finish reading it. We can set up an equation as follows:
x = 392 / 14
Solving for x, we get:
x = 27 days
Therefore, Frank needed 27 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, we are given that Frank finished the book in 569 days. So, plugging this value into our equation, we get: Number of pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages The book has 12380 pages.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 6 days to finish the book with 612 pages. Therefore, we can calculate his reading speed as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages per day x Number of days taken
= 612 pages x 6 days
= 3704 pages/day

So, Frank read 3704 pages per day."
Response:  We know that there are 5 chapters and each chapter has an equal number of pages (555 pages / 5 = x pages per chapter). Since it took Frank 220 days to finish the book, we can set up the equation: x pages/chapter \* 220 days = total pages read. Solving for x, we get: x = 44 pages per chapter. So, there are approximately 44 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish his favorite book, which has 193 pages divided into 15 chapters. To find out how many chapters he read per day, we can divide the number of days taken by him to finish the book (660) by the total number of chapters in the book (15):

660 / 15 = 44 days
So, Frank read one chapter every 44 days."
Response:  We know that Frank read 3 books in total and each book had 249 pages. So, he read a total of 747 pages (3 x 249). Now, we need to find out how many pages he read per day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish reading all three books: 747 pages / 3 days = 249 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 249 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank takes 12 days to read each book and he has already read some books. So, if he needs 492 days to read all the books, it means that he will take 492/12 = 40 days to finish reading each remaining book. Therefore, the number of books Frank reads is given by the formula: Number of books = Total time / Time per book = 492 days / 40 days per book = 12 books.
"Response:  If it took him 16 days to finish the book and the book had 112 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 112 pages / 16 days
= 7 pages per day

Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days."
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, then he will take x days to finish reading the book. We can write an equation as follows: Number of days = Total number of pages / Number of pages read per day. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of days = 576 / 8 = 72 days. Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  Since there are 41 chapters in the book and each chapter has 450 pages, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 41 x 450 = 18,650 pages Now, let's find out how many days it took Frank to read the entire book. According to the question, it took him 30 days to finish reading the book. Therefore, we can calculate his daily page count as follows: Daily page count = Total pages / Number of days taken = 18,650 / 30 = 621 pages per day So, Frank read 621 pages every day for 30 days to complete his favorite book.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish his favorite book, which has 3 chapters. Each chapter has 594 pages, so we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Chapter 1: 594 pages x 3 = 1,782 pages
Chapter 2: 594 pages x 3 = 1,782 pages
Chapter 3: 594 pages x 3 = 1,782 pages

Therefore, each chapter has 1,782 pages."
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish his favorite book, which consists of two chapters with 405 pages each. To calculate how many pages he read per day, we can use the following formula: Number of pages read = Total number of pages / Time taken to read (in days). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of pages read = 810 pages (total pages) / 664 days (time taken to read) = 12 pages/day So, Frank read 12 pages of his favorite book every day.
Response:  If we want to know how much each pack of DVDs costs, we need to divide the total cost (120 dollars) by the number of packs (6). So, the calculation is as follows: $120 / 6 = $20 per pack. Therefore, each pack of DVDs costs $20.
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages would cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
So, it would cost $2693 to buy 33 packges of DVDs at $81 per package."
Response:  The cost of one pack of DVDs is $107. If we have a discount of $106 per package, then the price of each package after the discount will be $1 = $106. To find out how many packages you can buy for $93, we need to divide the total amount available for purchase ($93) by the price of each package after the discount ($1): Number of packages = Total amount available for purchase / Price of each package after discount = $93 / $1 = 93 packages So, you can buy 93 packages of DVDs for $93 with a discount of $106 per package.
Response:  The cost of each pack is $76 - $25 = $51 per pack. So you will have to pay $51 for each pack. 
"Response:  If you have $104 to spend and each pack of DVDs costs $26, then you can buy:
$104 / $26 = 4 packs of DVDs
So, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs with your $104."
Response:  If we can buy 2 packag...
Response:  We have 18 bananas and we want to group them into groups of size 2. To find out how many groups there are, we can divide 18 by 2: 18 / 2 = 9. So, there will be 9 groups of 2 bananas each.
"Response:  If there are some bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of 187 bananas each, then...
Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas in all groups.
Total number of bananas = Number of groups x Total number of bananas in each group
= 140 x 187
= 23,860 bananas
Therefore, Philip has 23,860 bananas in his collection."
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and we want to divide them into groups of 7. So, we need to find out how many groups we can make with 203 bananas.
We can do this by dividing 203 by 7:
203 / 7 = 29
So, we can make 29 groups of bananas.
Now, let's move on to the oranges. There are 63 oranges and we want to divide them into groups of 95. How many groups can we make with 63 oranges?
We can do this by dividing 63 by 95:
63 / 95 = 0.66
So, we can make approximately 66 groups of oranges."
"Response:  We know that there are 356 oranges and we want to divide them into groups of size x. Since there are 142 bananas, let's assume that each group of oranges contains at least as many oranges as there are bananas (i.e., 142). Therefore, we can write an equation based on this assumption:

Number of orange groups = Total number of oranges / Number of bananas
= 356 / 142
= 2

So, there will be two groups of oranges."
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philips collection and each group contains 392 bananas in total. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  196 x 392 = Total number of bananas So, the size of each group is: 392 / 196 = 2 Each group contains 2 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and we have to find out how many groups there are altogether. So, let's write an equation based on this information: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group. In this case, total number of bananas is 180 and number of bananas per group is 18, so we can plug these values into our equation as follows: Number of groups = 180 / 18 = 10 groups. Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philips collection.
"Response:  If there are 290 bananas and they will be divided into two groups, then each group must contain an equal number of bananas. Therefore, we can write:
Group 1 contains x bananas (where x is the total number of bananas / 2)
Group 2 contains 290 - x bananas
Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:
x = 290 / 2 = 145 bananas
So, Group 1 contains 145 bananas and Group 2 contains 145 + 290 - 145 = 100 bananas."
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in total. If we divide the number of oranges by the number of groups of oranges (16), then each group of oranges has 24 oranges (384 / 16 = 24). Therefore, each group of oranges contains 24 oranges.
Response:  If Brenda's mother has prepared 38 kekses and each of them had 19 kekses, then we can calculate how many guests she has invited as follows: Number of guests = Total number of kekses / Number of kekses per guest = 38 / 19 = 2 Therefore, Brenda's mother has invited 2 guests for the party.
Response:  If Brenda's mother has made 14 kekses and each of them had 30 kekses, then... (14 x 30) = 420 kekses have been prepared in total!
Response:  If Brenda's mother made keks for 5 people and she prepared 22 keks in total, then each person got x keks where x is the number of keks divided by 5 (the number of people). Since Brenda had to throw away 17 keks, that means there were originally 22 - 17 = 5 keks left over after everyone had their share. So, each person got 5/5 = 1 kek.
Response:  If Brenda's mother has made keks for 10 guests but only 9 guests have come, then there are 10 - 9 = 1 extra keks left over. So each guest had to receive an average of 18 / 9 = 2 keks.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for 2 guests, and each guest had the same number of cookies, then the total number of cookies that each guest received is half of the total number of cookies made (since there are two guests). So, if Brenda's mother made 14 cookies, then each guest received 7 cookies (half of 14).
Response:  If Brenda's mother has prepared keks for 10 guests and each guest received 2 keks, then... (1) x 2 = 20 keks were distributed in total. Therefore, Brenda's mother had prepared keks for 5 guests (20 / 4).
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them equally among two bags, then each bag will contain 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy. So, there are 21 pieces of candy in each bag.
"Response:  If Frank has x pieces of candy and he wants to put them into 26 boxes with 33 candies each, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = 26 × 33
Now, solve for x:
x = 840
So, Frank had 840 pieces of candy."
Response:  We know that Frank had initially 33 pieces of candy and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 remaining pieces of candy. Since we want to put these pieces into bags with 9 candies each, we will have 9 / 1 = 9 bags. Therefore, Frank has 9 bags of candy.
Response:  If Frank had 22 pieces of candy and he put 11 pieces into each pocket, then... (1) x = 22 (2) x = 11 (3) x = 11 So, Frank has 11 pockets.
Response:  If Frank had 16 pieces of candy and he divided them equally among two bags, then each bag would contain 8 pieces of candy (16 / 2 = 8).
"Response:  If Shirley has sold 25 boxes with trefoil boxes, and each box contains 14 trefoil boxes, then we can calculate how many trefoil boxes she needs to deliver as follows:
Number of trefoil boxes = Total number of boxes x Number of boxes per container
= 25 x 14
= 350 trefoil boxes
Therefore, Shirley needs to deliver 350 trefoil boxes."
Response:  If Shirley has sold 10 boxes of Trefoils and she needs to sell 5 boxes altogether, then each box contains 2/5 = 4 Schachteln (Trefoils).
Response:  The total number of flasches is 76 (67 + 9). Now we have to find out how many flaschen normal limonade there are more than diet limonade. So let's divide the number of normal limonade flaschen by the number of diet limonade flaschen: $76 / 9 = 8$. Therefore, there are 8 more flaschen of normal limonade than diet limonade.
Response:  The total number of flasches is 83 (22 + 61). To find out how many flaschenes Diätlimonade they had more than normal limonade, we need to subtract the number of normal limonade from the total number of flaschenes. So, the answer is: 61 - 22 = 40. Therefore, they had 40 more flaschenes of diet lemonade than normal lemonade.
Response:  The business had 30 flasches of normal lemonade and 8 flasches of diet lemonade. So they have in total 30 + 8 = 38 flasches. Additionally, there were 41 apples. Since an apple is not a type of drink, we can ignore it for this calculation. Therefore, the business has 38 flasches of lemonade.
Response:  The total number of flasches is 79 + 53 = 132. Now we have to find out how many flaschen normal limonade they had more than diet limonade. So let's subtract the number of diet limonade from the total number of flaschen: 132 - 53 = 80. Therefore, they had 80 flaschen of normal limonade more than diet limonade.
Response:  We know that there are 54 flasches of diet lemonade and 83 flasches of normal lemonade. To find out how many more flasches of normal lemonade they have than diet lemonade, we can subtract the number of flasches of diet lemonade from the total number of flasches of lemonade: 83 - 54 = 29. So, they have 29 more flasches of normal lemonade than diet lemonade.
Response:  We know that there are 17 flasches in total and 9 of them are normal limonade. So, we have 8 flaschen left which means 8/17 = 0.47 (approximately) flaschen of diet limonade. Therefore, they had approximately 4.7 flaschen of diet limonade.
Response:  The total number of flasches is 95 (19 + 60). Since they have more than diet lemonade, we know that the number of normal limonade flasches must be greater than 19. So, the answer is 41 (60 - 19 = 41).
Response:  The total number of drinks is 72 + 32 = 104. Since there are more flasches than apples, we can say that the number of flasches exceeds the number of apples. So, the difference between the two numbers is equal to the number of flasches minus the number of apples. In this case, the difference is 104 - 78 = 26. Therefore, they had 26 more flasches than apples.
Response:  The total number of drinks is 36 + 80 = 116. Since there are more than apples (36), we can say that the number of drinks exceeds the number of apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of drinks and the number of apples is greater than zero. So, the answer is: More than 36.
Response:  We know that there are 30 flasches in total and 28 of them are normal limonade. So, we have to find out how many diet limonade bottles they have. To do this, we can divide the number of diet limonade bottles by the total number of bottles. In this case, if we divide 4 (the number of diet limonade bottles) by 30 (total number of bottles), we get 1. So, they had 1 bottle of diet limonade.
Response:  The business had 4 flasches of diet lemonade and then they added 79 more flasches of normal lemonade. So, in total, they have 83 flasches (4 + 79) of lemonade. Since we know that 4 of those are diet lemonade, that means there are 83 - 4 = 79 flasches of normal lemonade.
Response:  The total number of flasches is equal to the sum of all three categories: normal limonade (57), diet limonade (26), and light limonade (27). Therefore, we can write: Total = 57 + 26 + 27 = 100. So they had altogether 100 flasches of different types of lemonade.
Response:  The total number of flasches is 81 + 60 + 60 = 201. Now we know that there are more than 60 flasches of normal limonade because if there were only 60, then all the other drinks would have been diet or light. So, the number of flasches of normal limonade is greater than 60. We can conclude that they had at least 121 flasches of normal limonade (81 - 60).
Response:  The business had 49 normal limonades and 40 diet limonades. So in total they have 49 + 40 = 89 flasches of limonade.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors to the Buckingham Palace yesterday and then 317 visitors today, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = Today's number - Yesterday's number
= 317 - 295
= 22
Therefore, 22 more people visited the Buckingham Palace today than did so yesterday."
"Response:  If 703 people visited the palace yesterday and 246 people visited today, then we can calculate the number of visitors within 25 days as follows:

Number of visitors in 25 days = Number of visitors yesterday x (1 + Number of visitors today / 25)
= 703 x (1 + 246/25)
= 703 x 2.92
= 1831.1
Therefore, within 25 days, approximately 1831 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If 100 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there were 666 visitors, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 666 - 100 = 566

So, 566 more people visited the Buckingham Palace today than did so yesterday."
"Response:  If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after 327 days with 406 total visitors, then we can calculate the number of visitors per day as follows:

Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 406 / 327
= 1.25 visitors per day
Therefore, there were approximately 1.25 visitors to Buckingham Palace each day over the past 327 days."
Response:  We know that in the last 85 days, a total of 829 people visited the Buckingham Palace. Now, we are told that after they had a hearty meal, they went to the Buckingham Palace. So, let's assume that these 45 visitors were among the 829 people who visited the palace in the last 85 days. Therefore, the number of visitors on that day was 829 - 45 = 784.
"Response:  If there were 188 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on day 1 and then 557 visitors on day n (where n is the number of days since day 1), we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:

188 + x = 557

Where ""x"" represents the total number of visitors over the 57-day period.

Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 557 - 188
= 369

Therefore, within the 57-day period, there were 369 visitors to the Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors to the Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 661 visitors, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

661 - 600 = 61

So, 61 more people visited the Buckingham Palace today than yesterday."
Response:  We know that there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace after they had eaten a hearty meal. The previous day, there were 419 visitors, and the day before that, there were 103 visitors. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 419 + 103 + 92 = 614. Therefore, there were 614 people who visited Buckingham Palace before this day.
"Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel and her friends had their hearty meal, then the total number of visitors over the last 89 days would be:

512 + 471 + 808 = 1791

Therefore, the answer is 1791."
"Response:  If there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and we know how many visitors came on the previous two days (191 + 457 = 648), then we can calculate the difference between these numbers as follows:

Number of visitors on this day - Number of visitors on the previous two days = 705 - 648 = 57
Therefore, more than 57 people visited Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous 245 days."
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax needed for all feathers is 628 grams and Albert has already used 159 grams of wax so far. Therefore, we can calculate the remaining amount of wax as follows: Remaining wax = Total wax - Used wax = 628 g - 159 g = 469 g So, Albert still needs 469 grams of wax to complete his task.
Response:  We know that he needs 49 grams of paint to color them and we also know that each feather requires 288 grams of wax. So, if he has already used 260 grams of wax, then he still needs to use 128 grams (49 - 260 = 128) more wax to complete his task. Therefore, he currently has 128 grams of wax.
Response:  We know that he needs 57g of paint to color the feathers and 22g more wax for other purposes. So far, he has used 57 + 22 = 79 grams of wax. Therefore, he still needs (353 - 79) = 274 grams of wax.
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of wax to glue all the feathers together and he currently has 20 grams, then he still needs 146 grams (166 - 20 = 146) more wax.
"Response:  We know that Wax has 557 grams of wax and he needs to melt it down to 17 grams. So, we can calculate how much wax each feather will need as follows:

Total amount of wax = 557 grams
Amount needed for one feather = Total amount of wax / Number of feathers
= 557 grams / Number of feathers

Since there are 30 feathers in total, we can calculate the amount of wax required for each feather as follows:

Amount of wax per feather = Amount needed for one feather / Number of feathers
= 557 grams / 30 feathers
= 18.56 grams per feather

Therefore, the fedders will require approximately 18.56 grams of wax each."
"Response:  We know that he has already used 11 grams of wax and needs 492 grams in total to glue all the feathers together. So, we can calculate how much more wax he needs as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = 492 grams
Amount of wax used so far = 11 grams

Therefore, the remaining amount of wax needed = Total amount of wax needed - Amount of wax used so far
= 492 grams - 11 grams
= 481 grams

So, the beaver needs 481 grams of wax more to complete his task."
Response:  If there are 94 pickers and they will fill 90 barrels in 6 days, that means each picker will fill an average of 15.17 barrels per day (90 / 94 = 15.17).
Response:  If there are 266 pickers and they will fill 90 barrels in 5 days, that means each picker will fill an average of 18 barrels per day (90 / 266 = 18).
"Response:  The farmer has saved checking the vineyards for his last stop. He was told that 294 pickers fill 244 barrels with grapes and 47 barrels with raspberries every day. To calculate how many barrels of grapes would be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of barrels filled per day by the number of days. So, the answer is:

244 barrels x 146 days = 35,084 barrels of grapes

Therefore, the farmer would have 35,084 barrels of grapes if he had saved checking the vineyards for his last stop."
Response:  The farmer has saved the checking of the vineyards for his last stop, and he was told that 235 pickers fill 100 barrels of honey every day and 221 barrels of grapes every day. To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of pickers by the number of barrels they fill per day, which gives us 235 x 221 = 51,655 barrels of grapes. Since there are 221 barrels of grapes filled every day, in 77 days, there will be 51,655 x 77 = 3,849,775 barrels of grapes filled.
"Response:  If 252 pickers fill 108 barrels per day and there are 58 days left until harvest time, then we can calculate how many barrels will be filled during that period as follows:

Number of barrels = Total number of pickers x Number of barrels per picker / Number of days left until harvest time
= 252 x 108 / 58
= 4608 barrels
Therefore, in 58 days, approximately 4608 barrels with grapes will be filled."
"Response:  If 36 pickers fill 8 fassen per day and there are 240 fasses to be filled, it will take them:

Days = Number of fasses / Number of pickers per day
= 240 / 36
= 6.94 days
So, it will take approximately 7 days for the 36 pickers to fill 240 fasses with grapes."
Response:  We know that there are 26 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium has the same number of animals as the total number of saltwater animals in all the aquariums. So, if we divide the total number of saltwater animals (52) by the number of aquariums (26), we get the average number of animals per aquarium, which is 2. Therefore, each aquarium has 2 saltwater animals.
Response:  We know that he had 40 sea creatures in total and each aquarium contains 2 creatures. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of aquariums = Number of creatures / Number of creatures per aquarium. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total number of aquariums = 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums. Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
"Response:  We know that there are 56 aquariums for salty water animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Since each aquarium contains 39 animals, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of salty water animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium
= 56 x 39
= 2248

So, Tyler has 2248 salty water animals in his collection!"
"Response:  We know that there are 74 aquariums for sweetwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Since each aquarium contains 46 animals, we can write an equation as follows: 
Total number of sweetwater animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Total number of saltwater animals = Number of aquariums x Number of animals per aquarium Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of sweetwater animals = 74 x 46 = 3380 Total number of saltwater animals = 22 x 46 = 952 Therefore, Tyler has 3380 sweetwater animals and 952 saltwater animals."
Response:  He has 15 aquariums for saltwater animals and each of those contains 19 animals, so he has 15 x 19 = 285 animals in total.

Response:  If you have overall 14 kekses and you want to divide them equally among 7 bags, each bag will contain how many kekses? To find out, we can use division. So, 14 / 7 = 2. Therefore, each bag contains 2 kekses.
"Response:  If each tube contains 3 cookies and you have 21 cookies in total, then...

Step 1: How many tubes can fit 21 cookies?
We know that each tube can hold 3 cookies, so we need to divide 21 by 3:
21 / 3 = 7
So, there are 7 tubes of cookies.

Therefore, you have 7 tubes of cookies."
Response:  We know that you had 26 bags with the same number of cookies as you did candies. So if you had 15 bonbons and 52 cookies, then each bag must have contained 52/26 = 2 cookies. Therefore, you had 26 bags with 2 cookies in each bag.
Response:  We know that you had 14 bags with cookies and the same number of candies. So, if you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total, then each bag must have contained 28/14 = 2 candies. Therefore, you had 14 x 2 = 28 bags with cookies.
Response:  If the mail carrier has to distribute 5 pieces of advertising material to each block and there are x houses in each block, then he will have to distribute 5x pieces of advertising material altogether. Since he distributed 25 brieftries to every house in each block, we can set up the equation: 5x = 25x. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 houses in each block.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and the mail carrier must give 9 pieces of advertising material to every house, then the total number of pieces of advertising material that the mail carrier needs to distribute is:

20 x 9 = 180 pieces of advertising material

So, the mail carrier should give 180 pieces of advertising material to each block."
Response:  Since there are 6 houses in each block and the postman has to give 24 pieces of advertising mail to each block, he will have to distribute 144 pieces of advertising mail altogether (6 x 6 = 36 blocks). So, each house should receive 4 pieces of advertising mail (144 / 36 = 4).
Response:  If the mail carrier gives each house 14 advertising flyers, and he has to give each block 2 flyers, then there are 7 blocks in total (since each block gets 2 flyers). Therefore, there are 7 x 14 = 98 houses in the entire area (since each house receives 14 flyers).
Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each block, and the mailman needs to give 32 pieces of advertising material to each house in each block, we can calculate how many pieces he should give overall as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of blocks x Number of houses per block x Number of pieces per house Total number of pieces = 20 x 32 x 32 Total number of pieces = 3072 pieces So, the mailman should give 3072 pieces of advertising material to all the houses in all the blocks combined.
Response:  Since there are 78 streets blocks in total and each block has 19 houses, we need to divide 30 (the number of pieces of advertising material) by 78 (the total number of street blocks). So, each house will receive 30 / 78 = 0.375 pieces of advertising material. Therefore, the mail carrier should give 19 houses 0.375 x 19 = 6.85 pieces of advertising material each.
Response:  If there are 55 blocks and each block has x houses, then the total number of houses is 55x. Since the letter carrier must distribute 8 pieces of advertising mail to every block, the total number of pieces of advertising mail distributed is 8(55x). Now we know that if he distributes 32 letters to each house in one block, then the number of houses in one block is 32/8 = 4. So, there are 55 blocks with 4 houses in each block, for a total of 220 houses.
Response:  Since there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 972 houses. So, the mail carrier needs to distribute 972 pieces of advertising material to every house. Therefore, he should distribute 972 / 81 = 12 pieces of advertising material per block.
"Response:  Since there are 16 blocks and each block has 4 pieces of advertising mail to deliver to every house, we need to calculate how many pieces of advertising mail he needs to distribute overall. So, the total number of pieces of advertising mail that the postman should distribute is:  
$ \text {Number of blocks} \times \text{Number of houses per block} \times \text{Total number of pieces of advertising mail per house} $ = $\boxed {252}$ pieces of advertising mail."
Response:  We need to divide the total number of murmers (20) into groups of 4. So we will create 5 groups. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We have to divide 10 murmels and 15 eggs into groups of 5. To do this, we need to find out how many times 10 can be divided by 5.
We know that 10 / 5 = 2. So, we will create 2 groups of 5 murmels each and 3 groups of 5 eggs each. Therefore, there will be 6 groups in total."
Response:  If we have n eggs and want to divide them into groups of size k, then each group will contain kn eggs (since there are k eggs in total). So if we have 11 eggs and want to divide them into groups of 2 eggs each, then each group will contain 55 eggs ( since 11 x 2 = 22). Therefore, Rebecca has 55 eggs.
Response:  We have to divide 8 eggs among 4 groups. To do this, we need to find out how many eggs each group will get. Since there are 6 murmers and they cannot be divided into groups, let's assume that one murmer is equal to 1 egg. So, if we want to distribute 8 eggs equally among 4 groups, each group will get 2 eggs (8 / 4 = 2). Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 murmers and 15 eggs. If she wants to divide them into three groups, each group will have how many eggs? To find out, we can use division. So, let's divide 15 eggs by 3 groups: 15 / 3 = 5 eggs per group. Therefore, each group will have 5 eggs.
Response:  We need to divide the total number of eggs into groups of 6. So we will divide 18 eggs / 6 = 3 groups. Now let's consider the bananas and murrels. Since there are more than enough to fill up all the remaining spaces, we can put them directly into their respective groups without worrying about running out of space. Therefore, we will have 72 bananas divided equally among 3 groups (24 each), and 66 murrels also divided equally among 3 groups (22 each). In summary, we will create 3 groups for the eggs, 3 groups for the bananas, and 3 groups for the murrels.
"Response:  We need to divide the total number of eggs (9) into groups of 3. So we will create 3 groups. Now let's see how many bananas, eggs and murmers are left over after creating these groups.

Bananas: 99 - 3 x 3 = 45
Eggs: 9 - 0 = 9
Murmels: 27 - 0 = 27

So, we can create 3 groups of 3 eggs each, leaving 45 bananas, 9 eggs, and 27 murmers."
"Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 murmers. If we divide the eggs into groups of 5, then how many groups can be formed?
We can form 4 groups (20 / 5 = 4). So, Rebecca has more eggs than murmers. The correct answer is 4."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 5 murmers and 12 eggs. If we divide the eggs into groups of 20, then each group will contain 6 eggs (since 20 / 3 = 6). So, Rebecca has more eggs than murmers. The correct answer is 6.
"Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and he got 11 points per round, then...

$ Number of rounds = Total score / (Total score per round) $
= 154 / 11 $
= 14 $
Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds."
Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds of the quiz game and won 46 points in each round, then he has won a total of... (calculate)...points in all 177 rounds! So, his overall score is... (write down your answer).
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points after two rounds of a quiz game and he scored the same number of points in each round, then we can write an equation based on this information: L = 84 (Round 1) and L = 84 (Round 2). Now we need to solve for L, which represents the number of points Luke scored per round. To do this, we can subtract one from both sides of the first equation: 84 - 1 = 83. Similarly, we can subtract one from both sides of the second equation: 84 - 1 = 83. Therefore, Luke scored 83 points per round.
"Response:  If Luke wins 146 points in each round and he played 157 rounds, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of points won by Luke in one round: 146 points/round x 157 rounds = 23,082 points

Step 2: Multiply the total number of points won by Luke in one round with the number of rounds played to get the overall score: 23,082 points x 157 rounds = 3,592,380 points

Therefore, Luke has scored a total of 3,592,380 points in the game."
"Response:  If Luke scored 3 points per round and he scored a total of 78 points, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of rounds Luke played = Total score / Score per round
= 78 / 3
= 26 rounds

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the quiz game!"
Response:  If Emily has 2 perls and can make 32 chains, then she must have made 16 chains of one perl each or 8 chains of two perls each. So, each chain requires at least 2 perls. Therefore, the answer is 2 perls for each chain.
Response:  If Emily has made 11 kettens and each chain requires 28 pearls, then she needs a total of 28 x 11 = 308 pearls. So, Emily had 308 pearls in total.
Response:  If Emily has 16 perls and each ketchn needs 8 pearls, then she can make 2 kettles (16/8=2).
"Response:  If Emily made 18 kettles and had 6 pearls, then each chain needed at least one pearl. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 
Number of Pearls = Number of Chains x Number of Pearls per Chain 
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 
Number of Pearls = 18 x 1 
So, each chain required only one pearl. "
Response:  If Emily makes one necklace with 5 pearls, then she needs 5 pearls for each of her 4 necklaces. Therefore, Emily has a total of 20 pearls (5 x 4 = 20).
Response:  We know that Emily has 6 perls and each chain requires 3 perls. So we can make 6/3 = 2 chains. Therefore, Emily can make 2 chains.
Response:  If Emily makes perlenketten for her 43 friends and she had 5 perls, then she can make 43/5 = 8.6 kettern with one perl. So each kette needs approximately 9 perls (round number).
Response:  If Emily makes perlenketten for her 44 friends and she needs 2 pearls for each chain, then she will need a total of 88 pearls (44 x 2 = 88). So, Emily had 88 pearls in total.
"Response:  The total number of children in the county is given as 819.058 + 668.278 = 1487.336. So, if 819.058 children go to camp and 668.278 stay at home, then the difference between these two numbers is equal to the total number of children who stayed at home minus the number of children who went to camp:

1487.336 - (819.058) = 668.278
Therefore, more children spent their summer vacation in the camps than those who stayed at home."
"Response:  The total number of children in the county is 990,480 (202,958 + 777,622). So, if 202,958 children went to camp and 777,622 stayed home, then the proportion of children who stayed home compared to those who went to camp is:

(777,622) / (990,480) = 0.783 or approximately 78.3%
Therefore, about 78.3% of the children remained at home while 21.7% (or 202,958 out of 990,480) went to camp."
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is 898,051. During summer vacation, 629,424 children go to camp and the remaining 268,627 stay at home. Therefore, 268,627 children stay at home.
Response:  The total number of children in Lawrence County is 313.473. During summer vacation, 274.865 children stay at home, which means that 38.608 children go to camp.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 907.611 children stay at home in the county of Lawrence and only 455.682 go to camp. So we can calculate the number of children who are not going to camp as follows: Number of children not going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp. In this case, the total number of children is equal to 907.611 + 455.682 = 1363.293 children. Therefore, there are approximately 1363.293 children living in the County of Lawrence.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 800059 children from the county of Lawrence go to camp and the rest stay at home. So, we can calculate how many children stayed at home as follows: Total number of children in the county = 828521 - Number of children who went to camp = 800059 = x Therefore, approximately x = 427662 children remained at home.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 61619 children stayed at home and the rest went to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of children in the county = Number of children who went to camp + Number of children who stayed at home. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total number of children in the county = 91676 - 61619 + x Where 'x' is the number of children who went to camp. Since all the children did not go to camp, we know that x < 61619. Therefore, the approximate number of children from the county who went to camp is: x ≈ 30000.
Response:  We know that 34,044 children from the county went to camp and 134,867 stayed at home. Additionally, 424,944 children from outside the county visited the camp. So, in total, 592,855 children attended the camp (34,044 + 134,867 + 424,944).
Response:  We know that 610769 children go to summer camp and 590796 children stay at home. So, we have a total of 610769 + 590796 = 1201065 children in the county. Now, we are told that 22 children come from outside the county. Therefore, the number of children in the county is 1201065 - 22 = 1199843 children.
"Response:  We know that 644.997 children stayed at home and 893.835 children went to summer camp. Additionally, 78 children came from outside the county. So, we have:

Total number of children = Number of children who went to summer camp + Number of children who stayed at home - Number of children who came from outside the county
= 893.835 + 644.997 - 78
= 1.506 million children
Therefore, there are approximately 1.5 million children in the County Lawrence."
Response:  If Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie and Adam has 9 apples in total, then Jackie must have 6 apples (3 + 9 = 12). So, Jackie has 6 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has: 10 - 2 = 8. So, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has. So, the answer is: Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jackie has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jackie has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jackie has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together 6 apples. If 4 more apples than them means they have altogether 10 apples (Adam + Jackie). So, the answer is 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have altogether 7 apples. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has 7 - x apples. Since Adam has more apples than Jackie, x > 0. Now, we are asked how many apples Adam has. From the problem statement, we can write an equation: x + 7 = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 2. Therefore, Adam has 2 apples more than Jackie.
Response:  We know that together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. If Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie has 4 apples (since 12 - 8 = 4). So, Adam has 12 + 8 = 20 apples in total. Therefore, Jackie has 12 - 4 = 8 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie and together they have 2 apples. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has 4 + x = 6 apples.
"Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jackie has less than x apples. Since Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, we can write an equation:
x + 11 = 89
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:
x = 78
So, Adam has 78 apples."
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Helen has baked 31 keks yesterday, 270 keks today morning and 419 keks the day before yesterday. So, we can write down the total number of keks that Helen has baked as follows: Total = 31 + 270 + 419 = 650. Therefore, Helen has baked 650 keks until yesterday evening.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 90 chocolate cookies and today she has baked 51 more rosined cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies. Additionally, there are 484 chocolate cookies that were already made yesterday. Therefore, the total number of chocolate cookies that Helen has made is 141 + 484 = 625 chocolate cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 527 chocolate cookies and today she baked 86 more rosined cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate cookies.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 85 rosinskekses today morning and added to the ones she had yesterday which is 397 rosinskekses. So, in total, Helen has baked 397 + 85 = 482 rosinskekses. Therefore, Helen has baked 482 rosinskekses.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate cookies and today she baked 231 more chocolate cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 250 chocolate cookies (19 + 231). Now, let's count how many rosins Helen has baked. According to the question, Helen has baked 237 rose cookies. Therefore, Helen has baked more chocolate cookies than roses cookies. The difference between the number of chocolate cookies and rose cookies is: 250 - 237 = 13. So, Helen has baked 13 more chocolate cookies than rose cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate cookies and today she baked 75 more. So, yesterday she baked a total of 197 + 75 = 272 chocolate cookies. Therefore, Helen had more chocolate cookies yesterday than today.
"Response:  Today, Helen has baked 280 rosins and 359 chocolate cookies. Yesterday, she had baked 300 rosins and 519 chocolate cookies. So, today, Helen has baked more rosins than yesterda... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. Today, Helen has baked 280 rosins and 359 chocolate cookies. Yesterday, she had baked 300 rosins and 519 chocolate cookies. So, today, Helen has baked more rosins than yesterday by 20 rosins (280 - 300). Therefore, Helen has baked 20 more rosins today compared to yesterday."
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:

81 - 59 = 22

So, Katie has 22 more games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie had 91 games and her new friends had 88 games together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games their old friends had. So let's subtract 53 from 179 to get the number of games their old friends had which is equal to 126 games. Therefore, Katie's friends had altogether 179 - 126 = 53 games.
Response:  Katie had 78 new games and 86 old games, so together she has 78 + 86 = 164 games. Her friends had 48 new games, so they have 48 games in total. Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends have together is 164 + 48 = 212 games.
Response:  Katie has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19 = 103). Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69 = 77). Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77 = 180).
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has more than her friends because she has 63 DS games and they have only 57 games. So we can say that Katie has at least 63 - 57 = 8 more games than her friends. Therefore, Katie has 8 more games than her friends.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games, which means she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Her friends have 34 new games. So, we need to find out how many games Katie has more than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the total number of games Katie has: 96 - 34 = 62. Therefore, Katie has 62 games more than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and then he gave $21 to Jason. So, Fred had $60 - $21 = $39 left. Now, Jason has $33 after washing cars over the weekend. Therefore, the amount of money Jason earned from washing cars is $33 - $21 = $12.
"Response:  
Fred had $86 last week and added $9 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $95. 
Jason had $5 last week and didn't work over the weekend, so he still has $5. 
Therefore, together they have $95 + $5 = $100."
Response:  Last week, Fred had $19 and Jason had $16. So together they had $35 ($19 + $16). Then, during the weekend, they washed cars and earned $40 more (Fred) and $69 more (Jason), for a total of $79 each ($40 + $69 = $79). Therefore, Fred earned $40 during the weekend.
"Response:  
Fred had $114 last week and earned $21 during the weekend, so he has $93 now ($114 - $21).
Jason had $22 last week and earned $78 during the weekend, so he has $90 now ($22 + $78).
Therefore, Jason earned $78 during the weekend."
"Response:  
Fred had $111 last week and earned $24 ($115 - $111) from washing cars over the weekend. 
Jason had $40 last week and earned $8 ($44 - $36) from delivering newspapers over the weekend. 
So, in total, they have earned $32 ($24 + $8)."
"Response:  
Fred had $49 last week and earned $73 this weekend (by washing cars). So his new amount is $122 ($49 + $73).
Jason had $3 last week and earned $50 this weekend (by selling newspapers). So his new amount is $53 ($3 + $50).
Therefore, Jason earned $47 more than Fred through selling newspapers ($53 - $122 = $-79)."
Response:  Firstly, Jason had $31 and then he spent time selling newspapers and earned $14. So, his new amount of money is $31 + $14 = $45. Now, let's consider Fred. He had $78 and then he earned $90 from washing cars over the weekend. So, his new amount of money is $78 + $90 = $168. Therefore, they have earned a total of $168 + $45 = $213 through selling newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 last week and then he earned $16 during the weekend through selling newspapers. So, his new amount of money is $33 + $16 = $49. Then, Jason had $95 last week and didn't do anything over the weekend, so he still has $95. Therefore, Fred earned $49 during the weekend while Jason still has $95.
Response:  Last week, Fred had $47 and Jason had $99. Then, during the weekend, Fred did some odd jobs and earned $111, bringing his total to $558 ($47 + $99 + $111). After that, he spent $34 on washing cars, leaving him with $524 ($558 - $34). So, Fred now has $524.
Response:  If Jessie started at 71 kilograms and has lost 20 kilograms so far, then she weighs 51 kilograms now (71 - 20 = 51).
"Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 27 kg (as stated in the question). If she has lost 101 kg after running every day, then her weight before running must have been:
Weight before running = Weight after running - Amount lost through running
= 101 kg - 27 kg
= 74 kg
Therefore, Jessie weighed 74 kg before starting to run."
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 126 kg. Since she has lost weight and now weighs 66 kg, we can calculate her initial weight as follows:

Initial weight = Current weight / (Lost weight)
= 66 kg / 60 kg
= 1.1 (or 110 kg)

So, before beginning her running routine, Jessie weighed approximately 110 kg or 243 lbs."
"Response:  Before starting to run every day, Jessie weighed 69 kg. If she has lost 35 kg since then, her current weight is:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

So, Jessie currently weighs 34 kg."
Response:  In week one, she lost 50 kg, so her weight after one week is: 114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg. In week two, she lost another 60 kg, so her weight after two weeks is: 64 kg - 60 kg = 44 kg. Therefore, she weighs 44 kg now.
Response:  Before starting to run, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week of running, she lost 62 kg, so her new weight is: 9 + (62 / 7) = 13 kg. In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, so her new weight is: 13 + (140 / 7) = 58 kg. Therefore, before beginning to run, Jessie weighed 58 kg.
Response:  After Jessie started jogging every day, she lost 56 kilograms in the first week and 99 kilograms in the second week. So, after the first week of jogging, Jessie weighed 92 - 56 = 36 kilograms.
Response:  We know that there were initially 95 snakes in the cage and then 64 of them hid themselves. So, the number of snakes that are not hidden is:  95 - 64 = 31.
Response:  The total number of alligators in the enclosure is 97. If 40 alligators are hiding, then the remaining alligators that are not hidden are 97 - 40 = 57. So, there were 57 alligators that were not hidden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 75 alligators in the cage and then 82 more alligators hid themselves. So, the total number of alligators hiding = 75 + 82 = 157 alligators. Therefore, 19 alligators were not hidden.
Response:  We know that there were 79 animals in total in the cage with snakes and alligators. If 24 of them are snakes, then the number of alligators is 79 - 24 = 55. So, altogether, 55 animals did not hide themselves.
Response:  The farmer had 171 tomatoes yesterday and picked 134 of them. So he has 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left from yesterday. Today, he picked 30 more tomatoes, so he will have 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes left after today.
Response:  The farmer had initially 160 tomatoes in his garden. Then he picked 56 of them yesterday and today he picked 41 more. So, after picking 56 yesterday, he had 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden. And today, after picking 41 more, he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in his garden. Therefore, the farmer still has 145 tomatoes in his garden after picking some yesterday and today.
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and picked 154 today. So, he has picked a total of 90 + 154 = 244 tomatoes.
Response:  The farmer had initially 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes, then he has 3 tomatoes left (175 - 172 = 3). As for the potatoes, he has 49 remaining (77 - 172 = 49). So, the farmer has 3 tomatoes and 49 potatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he has picked 53 tomatoes, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left in his garden. Similarly, if he has picked 12 kartoffsels, then he has 12 - 12 = 0 kartoffsels left in his garden. So, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 0 kartoffsels left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer had initially 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes for a total of 176 tomatoes (105 + 71 = 176). If he picked up 137 tomatoes, then the number of remaining tomatoes is equal to the initial amount minus the number collected: 176 - 137 = 39. So there are still 39 tomatoes left in the garden after picking 137 tomatoes.
Response:  If each wooden board needs 2 nails to be fixed, and John will use 4 nails in total for fixing all the boards, then he will need 4/2 = 2 wooden boards. Therefore, John needs 2 wooden boards to fix the house walls.
Response:  For each large wooden board (13 boards), John needs 13 x 17 = 209 nails to secure them to the wall. Additionally, he needs 8 nails for some smaller boards, so the total number of nails needed is 209 + 8 = 217 nails.
"Response:  If each large wooden board requires 3 nails to be attached and John used additional 8 nails, then... (1 mark)

Please provide your answer in the format of a numerical value."
Response:  For the large wooden boards, John needs 15 nails to secure them. Since there are 12 large boards, he will need 15 x 12 = 180 nails for these boards alone. Similarly, for the small wooden boards, John needs 5 nails per board. There are 10 small boards in total, so he will need 5 x 10 = 50 nails for these boards. Therefore, John needs a total of 180 + 50 = 230 nails to secure all the wooden boards for the house wall.
Response:  Since each brett requires 2 nails for fixation, we need to calculate how many nails are needed for 16 boards. Therefore, we have: Number of nails = Total number of boards x Number of nails per board So, in this case, the total number of boards is 16 and the number of nails per board is 2. Now, let's plug these values into the equation: Number of nails = 16 x 2 = 32 nails. 
Response:  If John needs 8 large wooden boards for the walls of his house and each board requires 74 nails to be fixed, then he will need... (8 boards x 74 nails per board) = 596 nails in total.
Response:  For each large wooden board, John needs 14 nails to be fixed. Since he will use 12 large boards, he needs 12 x 14 = 168 nails for them. Similarly, for each small wooden board, John needs 25 nails. Since he will use 17 small boards, he needs 17 x 25 = 425 nails in total. Therefore, John needs 425 + 168 = 593 nails to fix all the wooden boards for the house wall.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in total and each pack contains 3 pieces. So, we can write an equation as follows: 42 = x + x +... + x, where x is the number of packs. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do it?
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packings of gum and each packing contains 23 pieces of gum. Therefore, Robin has in total 43 x 23 = 1005 pieces of gum. Additionally, he has 8 extra pieces of gum, so the final number is 1005 + 8 = 1013 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that in each pack there are 7 pieces of gum. So, if Robin has x packs, then he has 7x pieces of gum altogether. Since Robin has 6 additional pieces of gum, we can add them to our total number of pieces of gum. Therefore, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 7x + 6 = 41. Now, to find out how many packs Robin has, we need to divide the total number of pieces of gum by the number of pieces in each pack. So, 41 / 7 = x packs. Therefore, Robin has 5 packs of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packs of gum and 13 packs of bonbons. Each pack contains 4 pieces of gum or bonbon. So, we can write an equation as follows: Gum = 28 x 4 = 112 Pieces Bonbon = 13 x 4 = 52 Pieces Total = 164 Pieces Now, let's simplify the equation to find out how many pieces of gum Robin has: Total = Gum + Bonbon Gum = 112 Pieces Bonbon = 52 Pieces Total = 164 Pieces Therefore, Robin has 112 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces. So, he has 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Now, we also know that he has 45 packages of candy and each package contains 9 pieces too. Therefore, he has 45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy in total.
Response:  Robin has 28 packs of gum and 14 packs of bonbons. Each pack contains 6 pieces. So, in total, Robin has... (calculate)...pieces!
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 shirts per minute and has produced a total of 6 shirts, then it must have worked for x minutes where x = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes to produce 6 shirts.
Response:  The machine worked for 5 minutes and can produce 4 shirts per minute. So, in total, it produced... (5 min) x (4 shirts/min) = 20 shirts!
Response:  We know that yesterday the machine produced 9 hemdens and today it produced 44 hemdens. So, we can write an equation as follows: Yesterday's production = 9. Today's production = 44. Now, let's convert both quantities into minutes: Production time (yesterday) = Number of hemdens x Time per hemden Production time (today) = Number of hemdens x Time per hemden Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Production time (yesterday) = 9 x 1 min/hemden = 9 min Production time (today) = 44 x 1 min/hemden = 44 min Therefore, the machine worked for 9 minutes yesterday and 44 minutes today.
Response:  The machine produced 13 hemdens yesterday and today it produced 3 hemens. So in total, the machine has worked for (13 + 3) = 16 minutes.
Response:  The machine produced 9 hemdens yesterday and today it produced 8 hemdens. So, we can say that the difference between the number of hemdens produced yesterday and today is equal to the total number of hemdens produced by the machine in one day (yesterday + today). Therefore, the equation would be: 9 - 8 = x, where x represents the total number of minutes the machine worked today. Solving for x, we get: x = 10 minutes. So, the machine worked for 10 minutes today.
Response:  The machine produced 4 hemdens yesterday and today it produced 8 hemens. So in total, the machine has worked for (4 + 8) = 12 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced 6 hemdens per minute, so it produced 72 hemens (12 min x 6 h/min). Today, the machine worked for 14 minutes and produced 6 hemdens per minute again, so it produced 84 hemens (14 min x 6 h/min). Therefore, in total, the machine has produced 156 hemens (72 + 84).
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 5 minutes and produced 5 hemdens = 30 hemden/minute (since each minute produces 6 hemden). Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced 12 hemden = 90 hemden/minute (since each minute produces 6 hemden). So, today the machine has produced 90 - 30 = 60 hemden more than yesterday!
"Response:  The total amount of money earned is $165. If they have sold their products for 5 days, then the number of days can be represented as x. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Total Amount = Number of Days \* Daily Income

We know that the daily income is constant, so we can substitute it with the value given in the question:

$165 = 5x

Now, we need to solve for 'x', which represents the number of days. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $165:

x = $165 / 5

Therefore, the vendor has earned $33 per day ($165 / 5)."
Response:  The Ringwurfspielstand earned $144 per day. To find out how much money they earned in total, we need to multiply this amount by the number of days they were open. So, if they were open for 22 days, their total earnings would be: $144 x 22 = $3,068.
Response:  The total amount of money earned from the ring toss game over 30 days is $420 (given). Additionally, they earned $22 in cash prizes (also given). So, we can set up an equation to represent this information: Total Earnings = Game Earnings + Cash Prizes. Substituting the values provided, we get: Total Earnings = $420 + $22 = $442. Therefore, the ring toss game earned $442 per day.
"Response:  The game has earned $382 for the first 44 days and $374 for the remaining 10 days. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is:
$382 + $374 = $756
So, they have altogether earned $756."
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 20 days is $120 + $66 = $186. Therefore, they earned $186 / 20 = $9.3 per day during the first 20 days.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 154 days is $325 + $114 = $439. So, they earned an average of $439 / 154 = $2.80 per day during the first phase. Now, let's calculate how much they earned per day during the remaining 57 days: $439 / 57 = $7.69 per day. Therefore, they earned $7.69 per day during the last phase of the event.
"Response:  According to the question, Lucy went to the grocery store and bought 10 packs of cookies (Kekse) and 4 packs of cake (Kuchen). To find out how many more packages of cookies she bought than cakes, we need to subtract the number of packs of cakes from the total number of packs of cookies. So, the answer is:

Number of packs of cookies - Number of packs of cakes = More packets of cookies
= 10 - 4 = 6
Therefore, Lucy bought 6 more packs of cookies than cakes."
Response:  According to the question, Lucy went to the grocery store and bought 4 packs of cookies (Kekse), 22 packs of cake (Kuchen), and 16 packs of chocolate (Schokolade). To find out how many total packages of food she bought, we need to add up all these numbers: 4 + 22 + 16 = 42. So, Lucy bought 42 packages of food at the grocery store.
Response:  We know that Lucy went to the grocery store and bought some candy and cookies. She bought 23 packs of candy and some packs of cookies. In total, she had 27 packages of food. So, if we divide the number of packages of food (27) by the number of packages of candy (23), we get the number of packs of cookies Lucy bought: 27 / 23 = 11. Therefore, Lucy bought 11 packs of cookies in total.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Lucy went to the grocery store and bought 2 packs of cookies (which contain 8 cookies each) and 12 packages of cake (which contain 4 cakes each). Therefore, she has purchased a total of 2 x 8 = 16 cookies and 12 x 4 = 48 cakes. So, altogether, Lucy has bought 16 + 48 = 64 units of food.
Response:  There were initially 12 people in the bus and then 4 more got into it. So, now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got into the bus at the next stop, so now we have 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people left the bus, leaving us with 20 - 3 = 17 people inside the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people in the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got off at the station and boarded the bus. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got into the train at the station, so now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people altogether. To find out how many students were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, the answer is: 676 - 22 = 654 students.
Response:  There were 73 parents, and each parent had 1 child (on average). So, there were 73 children. Then, there were 724 students, and each student had 7 teachers (on average). So, there were 5098 teachers. Therefore, the total number of people in the program was 73 + 5098 = 5171.
Response:  We know that there were 174 parents in the program and 521 students. To find out how many students were present compared to their parents, we need to divide the number of students by the number of parents. So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of students present = Number of students / Number of parents = 521 / 174 = 3.01 (round off to 3) Therefore, approximately 3 times more students than parents were present in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents in the program and 177 students. If we multiply these two numbers together, we get 10870 (61 x 177). However, the program could only accommodate 44 people, so we need to subtract this number from our total: 10870 - 44 = 10826. Therefore, there were altogether 10826 persons in the program.
Response:  If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet, then we can calculate the distance from the bottom of the cave to the end as follows: Distance = Rise + Run = 919 + 1307 = 2226 feet. So, the end of the cave is 2226 feet away from the bottom of the cave.
Response:  The distance from 849 feet to the bottom of the cave is 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. Since they are moving at a speed of 17 feet per second, it will take them (369 feet / 17 feet/second) = approximately 21 minutes and 30 seconds to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  If they are already at 659 feet and the cave is 762 feet deep, then they have to go down another 103 feet (762 - 659 = 103). So, they need to go 103 more feet until they reach the end of the cave.
Response:  We know that Paige had initially 8 goldfish in the pond and then some stray cats started eating them. The question states that the stray cats left 6 goldfish alive. So, we can calculate the number of goldfish that were eaten by the stray cats as follows: Number of goldfish eaten = Total number of goldfish - Number of goldfish left alive Number of goldfish eaten = 8 - 6 = 2 Therefore, 2 goldfish were eaten by the stray cats.
Response:  We know that Paige had initially 7 goldfish and 12 welsfish in the pond. If we add these two numbers together, we get 19 fish. Since the cats have eaten some of them, there are now only 15 left. So, the number of fish that are missing is 19 - 15 = 4. Therefore, 4 fish are missing or have been eaten by the cats.
Response:  We know that Paige had initially 16 goldfish and 71 wels fish in the pond. If we assume that all of them were eaten by stray cats (which is not true), then the total number of fish consumed would be 16 + 71 = 87. Since only two goldfish are left now, it means that 85 fish have disappeared. Therefore, the answer to the question is 85.
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond and 5 of them were eaten by stray cats. So, we have to find out how many goldfish are left after the cats ate some of them. To do this, we can use subtraction. If we subtract 5 from 15, we get 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond after the cats ate some of them.
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and made some cakes using 2 of them. So he has 43 - 2 = 41 apples left.
Response:  The cook had 58 apples initially and made some cakes that used 35 of them. So, how many apples are left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of apples used from the initial amount: 58 - 35 = 23. Therefore, there were 23 apples left after the cook made the cakes.
Response:  The cook had 40 apples and 54 pears to start with. If he made some cakes using these fruits, he would have X number of apples left afterward (since he had 39 apples remaining). So we can write an equation as follows: 40 + 54 = X. Now solve for X.
Response:  If Adam can place 11 action figures on each of his four shelves, then he will have a total of 11 x 4 = 44 action figures on all of his shelves combined. Since there are 40 drawers in his room and not all of them may be used for storing action figures, we subtract that number from the total to get our final answer. Therefore, the answer is 44 - 40 = 4 action figures that could potentially fit on Adam's shelves.
Response:  We know that Adam could place 10 action figures on each shelf, and his room can hold 8 action figures altogether. So, if we divide the total number of action figures (10 x 10 = 100) by the number of action figures per shelf (8), we get the number of shelves: 100 / 8 = 12.5 shelves. Since you cannot have a fraction of a shelf, there must be 13 shelves in Adam's room.
Response:  If Adam can place 8 action figures and 10 shelves on each of his four regales, then he has a total of 8 x 4 = 32 action figures and 10 x 4 = 40 shelves. So, his regales could hold a total of 32 + 40 = 72 objects.
Response:  There are 10 gardens in total, and each garden has 544 pots with 32 flowers inside them. Therefore, there are 544 x 10 = 5440 flowers altogether.
Response:  There are 466 pots in total. Each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks inside it. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 466 x 53 = 24,908. The total number of sticks is 466 x 181 = 87,666. So there are 24,908 flowers and 87,666 sticks in all.
Response:  There are 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers and 91 sticks inside it. So, in total, there are 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. Therefore, the answer is 9671.
Response:  Each pot has 40 blossoms inside it, so there are 40 x 1 = 40 pots in total. Therefore, there are 400 - 40 = 360 blossoms outside of the pots. So, there are 360 / 40 = 9 pots without any blossoms left over. Thus, there are 9 + 40 = 50 pots altogether.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 Radiergummis. If we want to divide them into groups of equal size, we need to find out how many groups we can make with these numbers. To do this, we can use division. For example, if we have 4502 Skittles and we want to divide them equally among 154 groups, each group will contain 30 Skittles (4502 / 154 = 30). Similarly, if we have 4276 Radiergummis and we want to divide them equally among 154 groups, each group will contain 28 Radiergummis (4276 / 154 = 28). So, each group contains either 30 Skittles or 28 Radiergummis.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Stevens collection and he also has 4950 radigummi. If we divide the number of radigummi by 495, we get 9.67 radigummi per group. So, each group contains approximately 9.67 radigummi.
Response:  If there are 896 Skittles and we want to divide them into groups of equal size, then each group must contain an integer multiple of 896 / 8 = 112 Skittles. Therefore, each group will contain 112 Skittles.
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of classes as follows: Number of classes = Total students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in total.
Response:  The school has 304 classes and each class has 75 students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of Students = Total number of Classes x Number of Students per Class. In this case, we have: Number of Students = 304 x 75 = 22,600 students. So there were altogether 22,600 students in the school.
