Response:  On Monday (Mangalvar), he played with 10 children. So, on Sunday (Somvar), he played with how many more children than on Monday?  To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of children he played with on Monday from the total number of children he played with on Sunday.  Therefore, the answer is: 18 - 10 = 8 more children.
"Response:  On Monday (Julia played with 11 children), Julia played with more than 10 but fewer than 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday (she played with 12 children) is:

Difference = Number of children played with on Monday - Number of children played with on Tuesday
= 11 - 12
= -1
Therefore, Julia played with 1 less child on Tuesday compared to Monday."
Response:  Julie played with 5 children on Sunday and then again with some more children on Monday. If she played with total of 15 children, then she must have played with how many children on each day?  So, the answer is: 5 + x = 15 where x is the number of children Julie played with on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Somvar), he played with 4 children. If he had played with all 16 children, then he would have played with 4 + 12 = 16 children in total. So, he played with 16 - 4 = 12 children on Somvar.
Response:  Julie played with 16 children on Sunday and 12 children on Monday. So, if she had played with 12 children on Sunday, then she would have played with how many children on Monday? Option (D) - 12 children. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D).
Response:  Julie played with 14 children on Monday and if she had played with 8 more children on Sunday, then she would have played with 22 children in total (14 + 8). So, Julie played with 22 children on Sunday.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia), she played with 17 children. On Monday (Mangalwar), she played with 20 children, and on Budhwar (Wednesday), she played with 18 children. So in total, she played with 45 children.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia played with 15 children), Monday (she played with 18 children), and Wednesday (she played with 97 children). So, Julia played with a total of 15 + 18 + 97 = 130 children.
Response:  On Sunday (July 2), Julie played with 5 children. On Monday (July 3), she played with 9 more children, so the total number of children she played with on these two days is: 5 + 9 = 14. Now, let's move to Tuesday (July 4). She played with 15 more children, so the total number of children she played with from Sunday to Tuesday is: 14 + 15 = 29. Therefore, Julie played with a total of 29 children from Sunday to Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Mangalvar), Julie played with 2 children and on Wednesday (Budhavar), she played with 16 children. So, in total, Julie played with 18 children (2 + 16).
Response:  On Monday (Mangalvar), she played with 7 children.  On Tuesday (Somvar), she played with 9 children more than on Monday. So, the number of children she played with on Somvar is 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, she played with 16 children on Somvar.
Response:  On Monday (Julia), two children played with 14 other children. So, in total, there were 16 children playing together. Now, let's find out how many children played with Julia on Tuesday (Mangalvar) and Wednesday (Budhavar). We know that 8 children played with Julia on Budhavar, so the number of children who did not play with her on Mangalvar is 8 - 8 = 0. Therefore, Julia played with 0 children on Mangalvar.
Response:  On Monday (Mangalwar), she played with 8 children. On Tuesday (Budhavar), she played with 11 more children than on Monday, so the total number of children she played with on Budhavar was 11 + 8 = 19 children. Therefore, she played with 19 children on Budhavar.
Response:  On Sunday (Julia played with 15 children), Monday (she played with 18 children), and Tuesday (she played with 7 children). So, in total, Julia played with 30 children.
Response:  On Monday (budhavar), she played with 15 children.  On Tuesday (somvar), she played with 10 children. And on Wednesday ( Mangalwar), she played with 13 children. So in total, she played with 15 + 10 + 13 = 48 children.
Response:  On Monday (budhavar), she played with 20 children.  On Tuesday (somvar), she played with 7 children.  On Wednesday (mangalwar), she played with 13 children. Therefore, in total, she played with 20 + 7 + 13 = 40 children.
Response:  On Monday (Julia played with 12 children), she played for 3 hours. So, the number of children she played with = Number of hours she played / Time taken to play per child = 3/60 = 1/20 = 5 children.  Similarly, on Tuesday (she played with 14 children), she played for 2 hours. So, the number of children she played with = Number of hours she played / Time taken to play per child = 2/60 = 1/30 = 7 children. Therefore, Julia played with a total of 5 + 7 = 12 children in two days.
Response:  On Monday (Mangalwar), he played tag with 18 children for 2 hours = 18 x 2 = 36 minutes.  On Sunday (Somvar), he played tag with 19 children for 38 hours = 38 / 60 = 0.64 hours per child. So, in comparison to Sunday, he spent more time playing tag with fewer children on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the two days is: 0.64 - 0.36 = 0.28 hours.
Response:  On Monday (Julia played with 5 children), she had to play with 6 children on Tuesday (Tuesday). So, Julia played with 1 more child than on Monday. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  Julie played with 18 children in total. On Sunday, she played with 4 of them and on Monday, she played with some more. So, let's say she played with x number of children on Monday. Since we know that x is greater than 0, we can write an inequality equation as follows: 2x > 18 (since Julie played with 18 children in total). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: x > 9 ( since 2x > 18). Therefore, Julie played with 9 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Julia played with 4 children), Tuesday (she played with 6 children), and Wednesday (she played with 17 children). So, in comparison to Monday, Julia played with more children on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and the combined total of children she played with on Tuesday and Wednesday is:  4 - (6 + 17) = -13  Hence, Julia played with fewer children on Monday compared to the combined total of children she played with on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Response:  Bob ate some chocolates and then he ate 25 more. So, in total, Bob ate 25 + x = 68 chocolates (where 'x' is the number of chocolates Bob ate initially). Now, if Bob had eaten a total of 43 chocolates, then he must have started with 43 - x chocolates. Therefore, the value of 'x' is 15. So, Bob ate 15 chocolates initially.
Response:  Bobi first ate 28 chocolates and then he ate another 42 chocolates. So, in total, Bobi ate 70 chocolates (28 + 42). Now, we are asked how many pieces of candy did Bobi eat. Since each chocolate contains 6 pieces of candy, Bobi ate a total of 42 x 6 = 252 pieces of candy. Therefore, the answer is 252.
Response:  Bobi ate 33 chocolates and then he ate 4 more. So, in total, Bobi ate 37 chocolates (33 + 4). Then, he also ate 14 candies. Therefore, Bobi ate a total of 51 sweets (37 chocolates + 14 candies).
Response:  Bob ate 38 cookies at first and then he ate 36 more cookies. So, in total, Bob ate 74 cookies (38 + 36). Now, we are told that Bob also ate 16 chocolate chip muffins. Since each muffin has 4-5 chocolate chips, Bob ate a total of 64-70 chocolate chips (16 x 4-5). Therefore, the number of chocolate chip muffin tops that Bob ate is between 64 and 70.
Response:  Bobi had eaten 20 cookies at first and then he ate another 34 cookies. So, in total, Bobi had eaten 54 cookies (20 + 34). Then, he ate 18 more cookies, so the total number of cookies that Bobi ate is 72 (54 + 18).
Response:  Bob had 21 mithai in total and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 left. Then, he ate another 9 mithais, so now he has 16 - 9 = 7 left. Therefore, Bob has 7 mithais left.
Response:  Bob had 22 chocolates and he ate some of them. We are not told how many he ate, but let's assume it was 5. Now, if there were still 8 chocolates left after he ate 5, then Bob ate a total of 5 + 8 = 13 chocolate pieces in the beginning.
Response:  Bob had 19 mithai in total and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 19 - 2 = 17 mithais left.
Response:  Bob has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some of them. If he had 20 pieces left after eating some, then he must have eaten 12 pieces (32 - 20 = 12). So, Bob ate 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bob ate 17 chocolates at first and then ate 15 more. If he had started with 36 chocolate pieces, how many are left now? So, there are 36 - (17 + 15) = 36 - 32 = 4 chocolate pieces left.
Response:  Bob ate 23 chocolates in total. If he had started with 30 chocolate pieces, then he would have eaten 7 (30 - 23) chocolate pieces now. So, there are 7 chocolate pieces left with him.
Response:  Elon and Jack have 5 balls each in their respective parks. So, the total number of balls they have is:  Elon has 5 balls + Jack has 5 balls = 10 balls.  Therefore, there are 10 more balls with Elon than Jack.
Response:  Elon park has 10 gumball machines and Jack Park has 5 gumball machines. So, in total, there are 10 + 5 = 15 gumball machines between both parks.
Response:  Elon and Jack had 3 balls between them in the beginning. If Elon took 2 balls from Jack, then there are 3 - 2 = 1 ball left with Jack. So, there are 1 ball left with Jack in the end.
Response:  We know that there are 6 balls in Jack Park's bag and he has given 4 of them to Ella. So, the number of balls left with Jack is 2 (6 - 4 = 2). Now, we need to find out how many more balls were in Ella's park than the number of balls left with Jack. To do this, we will divide the total number of balls in Ella's park by the number of balls left with Jack. So, if Ella had 10 balls in her park, then the difference between the number of balls she had and the number of balls left with Jack is 8 (10 - 2 = 8). Therefore, Ella had 8 more balls in her park than the number of balls left with Jack.
Response:  Elon parked 5 cars in the parking lot. If he had parked more than 6 cars besides these 5, then how many cars would he have parked in total? So, the answer is 5 + (number of additional cars parked) = Total number of cars parked.
Response:  Elon had 3 gumball machines in Park A and bought 2 more from the same park later. Jack also had 5 gumball machines in Park B and sold 1 to Elon. So, how many gumball machines did Elon have in total after buying from both parks? We can start by adding the number of gumball machines he already had (3) with the ones he bought from Park A (2 + 1 = 3), and then add the number of gumball machines Jack had in Park B (5). Therefore, the final answer is: 3 + 3 = 6 gumball machines that Elon had in total after buying from both parks.
Response:  Elon had 2 gumball machines in Park A and bought 3 more gumball machines later. Jack also had some gumball machines in Park B. To find out how many more gumball machines Elon had than Jack, we need to compare the number of gumball machines they had initially. Initially, Elon had 2 gumball machines in Park A, and Jack had x gumball machines in Park B (we don't know the exact value of x). Later, Elon bought 3 additional gumball machines, bringing his total number of gumball machines in Park A to 5 (2 + 3). So, the difference between the number of gumball machines Elon had and Jack had is: 5 - x = 3. Since x represents the initial number of gumball machines Jack had, we can set up an equation: 5 - x = 3. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Elon had 3 more gumball machines than Jack.
Response:  Elon parked 2 cars and Jack parked 6 cars in the same parking lot. Then, Elon bought 3 more cars and parked them in the same lot again. So, the total number of cars parked by both Elon and Jack together is: 2 + 6 = 8 cars. Therefore, there were 8 cars parked by both Elon and Jack combined.
Response:  Elon parked 5 cars and Jack parked 4 cars in the same parking lot. Then, Elon bought 3 more cars and parked them in the same lot again. So, the total number of cars parked by both Elon and Jack is:  Total number of cars = Number of cars parked by Elon + Number of cars parked by Jack  Total number of cars = 5 + 4 = 9 cars. Therefore, there are 9 cars parked in the parking lot.
Response:  Elon had 6 balls in the park and then he left 4 balls there. Now, Jack has bought 3 more balls. So, the total number of balls in the park now is: 6 + 4 = 10 balls.  Therefore, the difference between the number of balls that Elon had and the number of balls that Jack has is: 10 - 6 = 4 balls.
Response:  Elon had 6 balls in the park and then he gave 2 more to Jack. So, Elon had 6 + 2 = 8 balls in the park. Then, Jack bought 4 more balls from Elon, so now Jack has 8 + 4 = 12 balls in the park. Therefore, there were 12 - 6 = 6 more balls in the park than what Elon had initially.
Response:  Elon and Jack together had 5 gumball machines in Park A and then Jack bought 3 more gumball machines. So, altogether they had 8 gumball machines in Park A.
Response:  Elon has 3 gubbares and 20 geendas in his park, while Jack has 5 gubbares and 59 geendas in his park. So, we need to find out how many gubbares and geendas each of them have in total.  To do this, we can multiply the number of gubbares they have with the number of geendas they have.  For Elon, he has 3 gubbares x 20 geendas = 60 gubbares and geendas.  For Jack, he has 5 gubbares x 59 geendas = 295 gubbares and geendas.  Now, let's compare their totals.  Elon has 60 gubbares and geendas, while Jack has 295 gubbares and geendas.  Therefore, there are more gubbares and geendas in Jack's park than in Elon's park.
Response:  Elan has 7 gubbaras and 5 geendos, so he has a total of 12 objects (7 + 5 = 12). Jack has 6 gubbaras and 4 geendos, so he has a total of 10 objects (6 + 4 = 10). Now, let's compare their collections: Elan has more objects than Jack - 12 vs 10. Therefore, there are more geendos in Elan's collection than in Jack's collection.
Response:  Elon has 5 balls in his pocket and he gives 3 of them to Jack. So now Elon has 2 balls left and Jack has 3 balls. If they both put all their balls together in the park, then Jack will have 3 + 2 = 5 balls in the park.
Response:  Initially, there were two balls in the park (ball 1 and ball 2). Then Jack brought three more balls to the park (balls 3, 4, and 5). So, initially, there were 2 + 3 = 5 balls in the park. Later, Jack added another 6 balls (balls 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11), taking the total number of balls in the park to 5 + 6 = 11 balls. Therefore, there were 11 - 2 = 9 additional balls that Jack brought to the park beyond the initial 2 balls.
Response:  Rayan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. So, in one day, he studies English for 6 + 2 = 8 hours. Now, let's calculate how many more hours Rayan studies Chinese than English per day:  Number of hours studied Chinese/Number of hours studied English = 2/8 = 0.25 (or 1/4) hours In other words, Rayan studies Chinese for 1/4th of the time he studies English. Therefore, Rayan studies Chinese for 8 - 0.25 = 7.75 hours less than English per day.
"Response:  Rayan spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. To calculate the difference in time spent between these two activities, we need to subtract the time spent on English from the time spent on Chinese:

Time spent on English = 6 hours/day - Time spent on Chinese = 7 hours/day

Now, let's convert both times into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Time spent on English (in minutes) = 6 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day
Time spent on Chinese (in minutes) = 7 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes/day

To find out how many more minutes Rayan spends on Chinese than on English, we can simply subtract the time spent on English from the time spent on Chinese:

Difference in time spent (in minutes) = 420 minutes - 360 minutes = 60 minutes/day

So, Rayan spends 60 additional minutes on Chinese compared to English every day."
"Response:  If he spends 3 hours every day learning English and some more time each day learning Chinese, then in total, he spends 4 hours per day on language learning. So, if he spends 4 hours per day on average on both languages, then he spends:

Total hours spent on English = 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week
Total hours spent on Chinese = 4 hours/day x 7 days/week = 28 hours/week

Therefore, he spends 21 hours/week on English and 28 hours/week on Chinese."
Response:  If he spends more than 2 hours extra in English learning compared to Chinese learning, then he spends (2 x 7) = 14 hours extra in English learning per day. So, he spends 14 hours / 7 days = 2 hours extra in English learning per day.
Response:  If he spends 5 hours every day studying Chinese and more than 2 hours extra in English, then he spends a total of 7 hours (5 + 2) per day on language learning. So, if he spends 2 hours more than he does on Chinese, that means he spends 9 hours (7 + 2) per day on English. Therefore, he spends 9 hours on English for every 5 hours he spends on Chinese.
Response:  If he studies English for 6 hours per day and Chinese for 7 hours per day, then in total, he will have studied for 42 hours (6 x 7 = 42).  Now, if he continues studying for 5 days, he will have studied for a total of 210 hours (42 x 5 = 210).
Response:  If he studies English for 6 hours per day and Chinese for 5 hours per day, then in total, he spends 11 hours (6 + 5) per day on language learning. Now, if he continues this routine for two days, he will have spent a total of 22 hours (11 x 2) on language learning. So, he has studied English for 22/6 = 3.67 hours per day and Chinese for 22/5 = 4.4 hours per day.
"Response:  If Rayan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese for 6 days, then he will spend a total of:

English = 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 x 6 = 24 hours
Total time spent = English + Chinese = 30 + 24 = 54 hours
Therefore, if Rayan spends 6 days learning both languages, he will have spent a total of 54 hours in Chinese language classes."
"Response:  If he learns English for 4 hours and Chinese for 6 hours every day, then in total, he will have learned English for 320 hours (4 hours/day x 86 days) and Chinese for 480 hours (6 hours/day x 86 days). So, his daily time spent learning each language is as follows:
English: 320 hours / 86 days = 3.75 hours per day
Chinese: 480 hours / 86 days = 5.56 hours per day"
Response:  The person speaks English for 6 hours a day, Chinese for 7 hours a day and Spanish for 3 hours a day. So in total, they spend 6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day learning these languages.
Response:  We know that Rayan spends 6 hours studying English every day, 3 hours studying Chinese, and 58 hours studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying English:  6 hours/day - 3 hours/day = 3 hours/day  So, Rayan spends 3 hours more per day studying English than Chinese. Now, let's convert this difference in hours into minutes:  3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes  Therefore, Rayan spends 180 minutes more per day studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Rayan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. He spends 4 hours studying Spanish in comparison to his English studies. So, he spends more time studying English than Spanish. The difference between the time spent on English and Spanish is 5 hours (7 - 2 = 5). Therefore, Rayan spends 5 additional hours studying English compared to Spanish.
Response:  The person spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Spanish. So, in total, they spend 9 hours (5 + 4) studying languages per day. Now, let's compare this to how much time they spend studying Chinese. They spend 8 hours studying Chinese, which is more than the time they spend studying both English and Spanish combined! Therefore, the difference between the time spent studying Chinese and the time spent studying English/Spanish is 8 - (5 + 4) = 3 hours.
Response:  If he spends 3 hours every day learning English and Chinese, then in one week (7 days), he will spend 21 hours (3 x 7) learning English and 21 hours (3 x 7) learning Chinese. So, if he reduces his English learning time to 2 hours per day, he will have an extra hour each day for Chinese learning. Therefore, he will spend 20 hours (2 x 7) learning Chinese in that week.
"Response:  Rayan spends 4 hours per day studying English and 5 hours per day studying Chinese. So in one week (7 days), he spends a total of:

English: 4 x 7 = 28 hours
Chinese: 5 x 7 = 35 hours
Total time spent studying both languages: 28 + 35 = 63 hours
Therefore, Rayan spends a total of 63 hours studying English and Chinese over the course of 7 days."
Response:  On Monday, she had 8 bags of rice worth Rs. 100 each = Rs. 800.  On Tuesday, she bought 7 bags of rice worth Rs. 100 each = Rs. 700. So, now she has Rs. 800 - Rs. 700 = Rs. 100 left with her.
Response:  On Monday (day 0), Tifanny had $7 in her wallet. She spent $12 worth of items and got $5 change. So, at the end of Monday, she had $7 + $5 = $12. Now let's move to Tuesday (day 1). Since she had $12 in her wallet, she spent $12 / 2 = $6 worth of items and got $6 change. So, at the end of Tuesday, she had $12 - $6 = $6. Therefore, on Wednesday (day 2), she had $6 + $5 = $11 in her wallet.
Response:  On Monday, she had 4 bags of rice worth Rs. 10 each = Rs. 40.  If she got some more bags of rice worth Rs. 12 each = Rs. 12 x 4 = Rs. 48 on Tuesday. So, in total, she had 40 + 48 = Rs. 88. Therefore, if she had a total of 6 bags of rice, then she would have received 6 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 60 on Wednesday.
Response:  On Sunday (day 1), she had 3 bags of rice. If she added 4 more bags on Monday (day 2), then she has 7 bags of rice now (3 + 4 = 7). So, on Sunday, she had 3/7 of the total number of bags. Therefore, the total number of bags she had is 7 x 3/7 = 21 bags.
Response:  On Monday (first day), she had 10 bags of rice.  On Tuesday (second day), she received 3 more bags of rice, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 bags of rice.  On Wednesday (third day), she received another 7 bags of rice, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 bags of rice in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 20 bags of rice.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), she had 8 bags of rice.  On Tuesday (day 2), she received 10 more bags of rice, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 bags of rice.  On Wednesday (day 3), she received 4 more bags of rice, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 bags of rice. Therefore, she had 22 bags of rice after Monday.
Response:  On Sunday, she had 3 bags of rice.  On Monday, she got 7 more bags of rice and 44 bottles of oil. So, in total, she had 3 + 7 = 10 bags of rice.
"Response:  We know that there are 17 large onions and 16 small onions in total.  To find out how many more large onions there are than small onions, we can divide the number of large onions by the number of small onions:

Number of large onions = 17
Number of small onions = 16
Ratio of large to small onions = Number of large onions / Number of small onions = 17/16 = 1.0625
So, there are approximately 1.0625 more large onions than small onions."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 lal addu and 11 haré addu in total. Now, we need to find out how many more haré addu there are than lal addu. So, let's subtract the number of lal addu from the total number of addu:

Number of haré addu = Total number of addu - Number of lal addu
= 11 - 5
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 more haré addu than lal addu."
Response:  We know that there are 10 small balls and some more large balls in the container. If we have a total of 15 balls in the container, then the number of large balls (haré àdor) can be calculated as follows: Number of large balls = Total number of balls - Number of small balls So, the number of large balls in the container is : Number of large balls = 15 - 10 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 large balls in the container.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red apples and some more green apples in the basket. If there are 10 more green apples than red apples, then the total number of apples in the basket is:  3 + (10 x Number of Green Apples) =?  So, the number of green apples in the basket is 30. Therefore, the number of green apples in the basket is 30.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples, 15 green apples, and 8 yellow apples in the basket. So, altogether we have:
Red Apples: 7 x 7 = 49 Red Apples Green Apples: 15 x 15 = 225 Green Apples Yellow Apples: 8 x 8 = 64 Yellow Apples Total Apples: 49 + 225 + 64 = 338 Apples Now, let me count them again for you!"
"Response:  We know that there are 7 red apples and 71 green apples in total. Now, we need to find out how many more green apples there are than red apples. So, let's subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples:

Green apples = Total apples - Red apples
= 71 - 7
= 64

Therefore, there are 64 more green apples than red apples in the basket."
"Response:  We have 2 lal adoos and 6 peele adoos in total. Now, we know that there are 14 harre adoos in Tokri. So, to find out how many more harre adoos there are than peele adoos, we can subtract the number of peele adoos from the total number of adoos in Tokri:

Number of harre adoos = Total number of adoos in Tokri - Number of peele adoos
= 14 - 6
= 8

Therefore, there are 8 more harre adoos than peele adoos in Tokri."
"Response:  We have 19 lal aadus and 11 pele aadus in total. Now, we need to find out how many more lal aadus are there than pele aadus. So, we can subtract the number of pele aadus from the total number of lal aadus:

Number of lal aadus - Number of pele aadus = Total number of lal aadus that are more than pele aadus
= 19 - 11 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 more lal aadus than pele aadus in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 6 lal aadus and 90 piela aadus in total. Also, we know that out of these, 16 hare aadus are tokri. So, let's calculate how many lal and hare aadus are in tokri.  Number of lal aadus in tokri = Total number of lal aadus x Percentage of lal aadus in tokri = 6/Total number of aadus x 100 = 6/270 x 100 = 22% Number of hare aadus in tokri = Total number of hare aadus x Percentage of hare aadus in tokri = 16/Total number of aadus x 100 = 16/270 x 100 = 59% Now, we have calculated the percentage of both lal and hare aadus in tokri. To find the actual numbers, we need to multiply the percentages with the total number of aadus. Number of lal aadus in tokri = 22% of 270 = 60 lal aadus Number of hare aadus in tokri = 59% of 270 = 154 hare aadus Therefore, there are 60 lal aadus and 154 hare aadus in tokri.
"Response:  We know that there are 18 lal aadus in total.  Of these, 14 are pile aadus and 17 are har aadus. So, the number of lal aadus is 18 - (14 + 17) = 3. Therefore, there are 3 lal aadus in Tokri. Similarly, we can calculate the number of pile aadus and har aadus as follows: Number of pile aadus = 14; Number of har aadus = 17."
Response:  We know that there are 14 pink and 5 red apples in total. So, the number of pink apples is 14 - 5 = 9. Similarly, the number of red apples is 5. Therefore, the number of pink apples is 9 and the number of red apples is 5.
Response:  We know that there are 65 tokri in total and each tokri contains 7 lal adoo and 3 hare adoo. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of adoos = Number of tokris x Number of adoos per tokri Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of adoos = 65 x (7 + 3) = 65 x 10 = 650 adoos Therefore, there are 650 adoos in total.
"Response:  We have 11 baskets of apples. Each basket contains 10 red apples and 18 green apples. So, in total, we have:

10 x 11 = 110 red apples
18 x 11 = 204 green apples
Total number of apples = 110 + 204 = 314 apples
Therefore, there are 314 apples in all 11 baskets combined."
"Response:  We have 6 tokri and each tokri has 16 lal adoo and 18 haro adoo. So, in total we have:

Lal Aadoo = 16 x 6 = 96
Haro Aadoo = 18 x 6 = 108
Total Aadoo = Lal Aadoo + Haro Aadoo = 96 + 108 = 204
Therefore, there are 204 lal adoo in all six tokris."
Response:  We have 7 tokri and each tokri contains 10 lal adoo and 2 hare adoo. So, in total we have 7 x 10 = 70 lal adoo and 7 x 2 = 14 hare adoo. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 hares among all the 7 tokri.
Response:  We know that in each tokri, there are 4 red beads and 3 white beads. So, if we have total 7 beads, then: Number of tokris = Total number of beads / Number of beads in each tokri  = 7 / (4 + 3) = 7/10 = 7 tokris. Therefore, there are 7 tokris.
Response:  We have two tokri and each tokri has 4 red beads and some more green beads. So, in total we have 12 beads. Now, if there are k green beads in one tokri, then there will be (12 - k) red beads in that tokri. Therefore, the number of green beads in one tokri is equal to the number of red beads in the other tokri. Hence, the number of green beads in one tokri is 6.
Response:  We know that there are 16 holes in total and 13 of them are lal (red). So, the number of haré (white) holes is 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 white holes in the tokri.
Response:  We have 15 tokens in total and each token has either 19 red balls or 4 green balls. So, the number of red balls = 19 x 15 = 285. Similarly, the number of green balls = 4 x 15 = 60. Therefore, the total number of balls in all 15 tokens is 285 + 60 = 345.
Response:  We have 10 addu in total and we want to know how many tokens are there in each token. So, let's assume that each token has 4 lal addu and 6 haru addu. Now, we need to find out how many tokens are there in total. To do this, we can use the formula: Total number of tokens = Number of addu x Number of tokens per addu. In this case, the number of addu is 10 and the number of tokens per addu is 4 for lal addu and 6 for haru addu. Therefore, the total number of tokens will be: Total number of tokens = 10 x (4/10) + 10 x (6/10) = 40 + 60 = 100 tokens. So, there are 100 tokens in total.
Response:  We have 60 paisa adoos and 2 laal adoos in total.  Now, we need to find out how many more harre adoos are there than laal adoos.  So, let's divide the number of harre adoos (6) by the number of laal adoos (2): 6/2 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 more harre adoos than laal adoos in the total amount of adoos.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 questions in the box. Then, they added some more questions to it, making the total number of questions equal to 8. So, if initially there were 4 questions in the box, then the total number of questions in the box now is 8 - 4 = 4. Therefore, Jeremy has added 4 new questions to the box.
Response:  The initial set of shapes consisted of 7 + 1 = 8 shapes. Later, they added another shape to make it 9 shapes in total. So, initially there were 8 shapes on the shelf.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 equation figures and 22 books in the box. Later, they added 6 more equations and one more figure to the box. So, the total number of equation figures in the box is: 4 + 6 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 equation figures in the box.
Response:  Initially, there were 5 boxes and 9 books in Jeremy's room. Later, he added 7 more boxes and one more equation figure to the shelf. So, initially, the total number of equations figures was 5 + 1 = 6. After adding the new ones, the total number of equations figures became 6 + 7 = 13. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 equation figures and 10 books in one of the compartments. Later, they added 4 more equations and another figure to the same compartment. So, now there are 6 equation figures (including the additional ones) and 10 books in that compartment. Therefore, the number of books in that compartment is 10.
Response:  Initially, there were 8 boxes of figures and 9 books in Jerry's room. Later, he added 10 more books to his shelf. So, the total number of books on Jerry's shelf after adding the new ones is: 8 + 9 = 17 books.
"Response:  Initially, Jerry had 7 boxes and 2 books in his room. Later, he added 4 more books to his collection. So, the total number of boxes he had after adding the new ones is:

7 + 4 = 11

So, there were 11 boxes on Jerry's shelf after he added the new ones."
Response:  Initially, there were 5 exercise figures and 2 books inside Jerry's room. Later, he added more books to his collection, making the total number of books 9. So, the number of books on Jerry's shelf after adding new ones was 9.
Response:  Initially, there were 8 pens in Jeremy's room. Later, he added 4 more pens and removed 5 old ones. So, the total number of pens on Jeremy's shelf after these actions is: 8 + 4 = 12 pens.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 cars parked in Jeremy's garage. Later, he added 4 more cars and removed some old ones. If there are 6 car figures on his garage now, then he must have removed how many car figures from the garage. So, the correct answer is 2.
Response:  Initially, there were 7 pens in Jeremy's room. Later, he added some more pens and removed 10 old ones from his collection. If now there are 8 pens on the shelf, then how many pens did Jeremy add after removing the old ones? Solution:  We know that initially, there were 7 pens on the shelf. Then, Jeremy added some more pens, but we don't know exactly how many. However, we do know that he removed 10 old pens from his collection. So, if there are currently 8 pens on the shelf, it means that Jeremy must have added at least 8 - 10 = 2 new pens to his collection. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  At first, there were 3 shelf figures in Jeremy's room (as stated). Then, he added 2 more shelf figures and removed 7 old ones. So, after this process, there are 10 shelf figures in total in Jeremy's room. Now, to find out how many shelf figures were initially present on the shelf, we need to subtract the number of new shelf figures (2) from the total number of shelf figures (10):  Initially, there were 8 shelf figures on the shelf (10 - 2 = 8).
Response:  Initially, there were 9 equation figures inside the jar. Later, they added 7 more equations and placed them inside the same jar. If they had 10 books in total, then how many additional equation figures are present inside the jar now? Therefore, the answer is 7 (the difference between the initial number of equation figures and the total number of books).
Response:  Initially, there were 3 books and 4 equation figures in Jeremy's room on a shelf. Later, they added 2 more books and another equation figure to the same shelf. So, now there are 5 books (including the new ones) and 5 equation figures (including the new one) on the shelf. Therefore, the total number of equation figures after adding the new ones is 5 + 5 = 10.
Response:  Initially, there were 7 books and 3 equation figures inside Jeremy's room. Later, they added 2 more equations and 1 figure to the shelf. So, in total, how many books were there after adding these new ones? We know that each equation has one book associated with it, so if we add two more equations, then there will be four books associated with them (one for each of the previous three equations plus one for the newly added equation). Therefore, the total number of books after adding the new ones is: 7 + 4 = 11 books.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on a branch initially. Now, some more birds come to join them. If there are total 6 birds on the branch, then how many birds came to join them? Therefore, the answer is 4 birds joined them (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds sitting on the branch (3 + 1 = 4). Then, 4 more birds joined them, making it a total of 8 birds (4 + 4 = 8). So, in total, 8 birds were sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that there are four birds and 46 bees sitting on the branch. If six birds join them, then the total number of creatures sitting on the branch will be:  Birds + Bees = 4 + 46 = 50 So, there are 50 creatures sitting on the branch.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 2 badgers on the log. When 5 more birds arrive, there will be a total of 8 birds (including the original 3) and still 2 badgers (remaining 2). So, the number of birds on the log is 8, and the number of badgers is 2.
Response:  We have 3 birds and 4 bats sitting on a branch. Two more birds join them, making it 5 birds in total. Now, there are 3 birds less than the number of bats on the branch, so there are 4 bats on the branch. Therefore, there are 5 birds and 4 bats on the branch.
Response:  We have 2 birds and 6 bakulas (bamboo sticks) initially. Then, 3 more birds join them. So, in total, we have 5 birds now. Since each bird needs one bakula to stand, we need 5 bakulas for all these 5 birds. Therefore, there are 5 bakulas standing on the bamboo stick.
Response:  We have four birds and six bees sitting on a tree branch. Two more birds come along with them. So, in total, we have... (4 + 2) = 6 birds sitting on the tree branch. Now, let's count the number of bees. We had six bees initially, and two more came along with the additional birds, so now we have... (6 + 2) = 8 bees sitting on the tree branch. Therefore, there are 6 birds and 8 bees sitting on the tree branch in total.
Response:  We know that there are 3 birds and 4 bakulas (elephants) sitting on the branch. So, the total number of animals sitting on the branch is 3 + 4 = 7.
Response:  We know that there are 6 birds sitting on the branch initially. When two more birds come and sit with them, the total number of birds on the branch becomes 8 (6 + 2). Now, when three more birds come and sit with them, the total number of birds on the branch becomes 11 (8 + 3). Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the branch in total.
Response:  We have four birds and three bags of corn. Each bird can hold one bag of corn, so we need to divide the total number of bags among the birds. Since there are four birds, each bird will get 4/4 = 1 bag of corn. Now, let's consider the situation where Garud also joins them. There were originally four birds, but now there is an additional bird (Garud). So, the total number of birds has increased from 4 to 5. To find out how many more bags of corn each bird will get, we need to subtract the original number of bags held by each bird from the total number of bags available. In this case, each bird had 1 bag of corn initially, so the total number of bags available was 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, each bird will get 4/5 = 0.8 bags of corn extra after Garud joins them.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds sitting on the branch. Then, 4 more birds came and sat with them, making it 10 birds in total. Finally, another 3 birds joined them, taking the total number of birds to 13. So, the answer is 13.
Response:  We have two birds sitting on a branch (2). Then five more birds come and sit with them (5 + 2 = 7). Finally, four more birds join them (4 + 7 = 11). So, there are eleven birds in total sitting on the branch.
Response:  We have 3 birds sitting on a branch initially. Then, 2 more birds come and sit with them, making it 5 birds in total. Next, another 6 birds join them, taking the total number of birds to 11. Finally, 4 more birds arrive, bringing the total count to 15 birds sitting on the branch. Therefore, there are 15 - 3 = 12 additional birds that have joined the initial 3 birds, i.e., the increase in number of birds is 12.
Response:  We know that there are 5 birds sitting on one branch and 3 birds sitting on another branch. When 4 more birds join them, there will be a total of 7 birds (5 + 3 = 7). So, the number of birds sitting on both branches is 7.
Response:  We have 6 birds and 2 dogs sitting on a bench. Then, 3 more birds join them, making it 9 birds in total. Now, we need to find out how many more stock are there on the bench compared to the number of birds. So, the difference between 9 birds and 6 birds is 3 birds. Therefore, there are 3 more stock on the bench than birds.
Response:  We have three birds sitting on a branch - A, B, and C. There are six more birds that join them later - D, E, F, G, H, and I. So, in total, we have nine birds (A, B, C + D, E, F, G, H, and I). Now, let's compare their positions on the branch. Bird A is at the top of the branch, followed by bird B, then bird C. Among the additional six birds, five of them (D, E, F, G, and H) sit below bird A in order of their position on the branch. Therefore, there are five more birds than bird A on the branch. The sixth bird, bird I, sits above bird A. So, the answer is 5.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 chapters. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to count the number of pages in each chapter separately and then subtract them from each other. So, the total number of pages in both chapters is:  First Chapter: 48 pages Second Chapter: 11 x 10 = 110 pages Therefore, there are 62 additional pages (110 - 48) in the second chapter compared to the first chapter.
"Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. So, we can calculate the difference between them as follows:

Difference = 80 - 37 = 43

Therefore, there are 43 more pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter."
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book with 60 pages each. So, the total number of pages in the book is: Chapter 1 = 60 x 2 = 120 pages Chapter 2 = 60 x 2 = 120 pages Total number of pages in the book = 120 + 120 = 240 pages Therefore, there are 240 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 36 pages. So, the total number of pages in both chapters is: Chapter 1 = 36 x 2 = 72 pages Chapter 2 = 36 x 3 = 108 pages Now, we need to find out how many pages are there in the remaining part of the book. Since the book has a total of 67 pages, the remaining pages must be: Remaining pages = Total pages - (Chapter 1 + Chapter 2) = 67 - (72 + 108) = 47 pages Therefore, there are 47 pages left after completing both chapters.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book with respective page counts as follows: Chapter 1 - 66 pages Chapter 2 - 35 pages Chapter 3 - 24 pages Total number of pages = Number of pages in chapter 1 + Number of pages in chapter 2 + Number of pages in chapter 3  Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages
"Response:  The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. So, we need to find out how many more pages are there in the second chapter compared to the first chapter. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter:

Number of pages in second chapter - Number of pages in first chapter = 23 - 91 = -68
So, there are 68 fewer pages in the second chapter than in the first chapter."
Response:  First chapter has 35 pages, second chapter has 18 pages, and third chapter has 3 pages. So, total number of pages in the book is:  Third chapter has only 3 pages, so total number of pages in the book is:
"Response:  The first chapter has 53 pages, and the second chapter has 75 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in both chapters, we get:

53 + 75 = 128

So, there are 128 pages in both chapters combined."
Response:  We know that there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter has 61 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of pages = 31 x 61 Number of pages = 1931 pages Therefore, there are 1931 pages in the book.
Response:  We know that there are 23 pages in total and 2 chapters. Since each chapter has 10 pages long, we can write: Chapter 1 = 10 + 10 +... + 10 (10 times) = 10 x 10 = 100 pages Chapter 2 = 23 - 100 = 13 pages So, there are 13 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are 81 pages in total and 2 chapters. The first chapter has 68 pages, so the second chapter must have x pages where x is the difference between 81 and 68, i.e., x = 13. Therefore, there are 13 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that 62 campers went to bed at night and 39 of them were found dead in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who did not die is: 62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, there were 23 more campers alive in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that there were 52 campers who went to sleep at noon and 61 campers who got sick in the evening. So, the number of campers who got sick in the evening is 61 - 52 = 9 more than those who slept in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of campers who got sick in the evening compared to those who slept in the morning is 9.
Response:  We know that 15 campers went for an early morning walk and some of them returned in the afternoon feeling unwell. If altogether 32 campers were affected, then we can conclude that during the afternoon (from noon to evening), 17 campers felt unwell.
Response:  We know that in the morning (subah), 3 campers did not have diarrhea and in the evening (doophar), 4 campers had diarrhea. So, the total number of campers who had diarrhea during the day is = 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, out of 60 campers, 7 had diarrhea.
Response:  In the morning, 13 campers were sick and in the evening, 49 campers were also sick. So, altogether 62 campers got sick (13 + 49). Therefore, the answer is 62.
Response:  We know that 39 campers went for morning walk at 6 AM and 31 campers went for evening walk at 4 PM. So, in total, we have 39 + 31 = 70 campers who walked during the day (morning or evening). Now, let's find out how many more campers went for evening walk than morning walk. To do this, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for morning walk from the number of campers who went for evening walk: 70 - 39 = 31. Therefore, there are 31 more campers who went for evening walk than morning walk.
Response:  We know that in the morning (subah), 48 campers were sick and in the evening (doophar), 49 campers were sick. So, there are more campers who got sick in the evening than in the morning. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who got sick in the evening and those who got sick in the morning is:  49 - 48 = 1.
Response:  We know that in the morning (7 am), 33 campers were sick and in the evening (8 pm), 34 campers were sick. So, there are 33 + 34 = 67 campers who were sick during the daytime hours (morning to evening). Now, we need to find out how many campers were sick between 5 pm and 9 pm (i.e., during the evening hours). From the given information, we can see that 10 campers were sick during this time period. Therefore, the number of campers who were sick during the evening hours is 67 - 10 = 57 campers.
Response:  We know that 13 campers started running in the morning and 59 campers started their long walk at noon. So, altogether, we have 72 campers who went for either running or walking. Now, out of these 72 campers, 21 campers were tired in the evening, which means they did not complete their run/walk. Therefore, the number of campers who completed their run/walk is 72 - 21 = 51 campers.
Response:  We know that 29 campers started their journey in the morning and 66 campers started their journey in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who started their journey in the afternoon is 66 - 29 = 37. Now, we are told that 26 campers were tired in the evening. Therefore, the number of campers who did not get tired in the evening is 37 - 26 = 11.
"Response:  We know that 41 campers went for an early morning trek and 4 of them walked for a long distance.  Out of these, 26 campers returned in the evening. So, the total number of campers who undertook both trekking and hiking is:

Total campers = Number of campers who went for early morning trek + Number of campers who walked for a long distance - Number of campers who did not return in the evening
= 41 + 4 - 26
= 69
Therefore, 69 campers undertook both trekking and hiking."
Response:  We know that 46 campers were sick in one day. Of these, 43 campers were sick in the morning and some more campers were sick in the afternoon. So, the number of campers who were sick in the afternoon is equal to the total number of campers minus the number of campers who were sick in the morning. Therefore, we can write: Number of campers who were sick in the afternoon = Total number of campers - Number of campers who were sick in the morning Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Total number of campers = 100 (from the question) Number of campers who were sick in the morning = 43 (from the question) Substituting these values, we get: Number of campers who were sick in the afternoon = 100 - 43 = 57 campers Thus, there were 57 campers who were sick in the afternoon.
Response:  Racheal picked 4 seeds from her tree in the beginning. So, there were 7 - 4 = 3 seeds left on the tree at that time. Now, she has added 4 more seeds to the tree, so there are now 3 + 4 = 7 seeds on the tree.
Response:  Rahul picked up 4 seeds and planted them in the ground. After some time, he harvested 3 seeds. So, Rahul picked up 1 seed and left 2 seeds in the ground. Therefore, Rahul picked up 4 seeds initially.
Response:  Rahul picked 6 seeds from his tree and planted them. Now there are 5 seeds left on the tree. If 3 of these seeds have been picked and the remaining 2 are still on the tree, then how many unpicked seeds are left on the tree? So, the number of unpicked seeds = 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 unpicked seeds left on the tree.
Response:  Racheal picked two apples from her tree and then there were seven apples left on the tree. If she picks six of them, then how many apples will be left on the tree after she has picked all of them? We can conclude that if Rachel picks all the remaining apples (which is equal to 7 - 6 = 1), then one apple will remain on the tree after she finishes picking. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.
Response:  Racheal picked 6 apples from her tree and then put them back. So, there were originally 6 apples in the tree. Now, there are 2 apples left in the tree (the ones Rachel picked) plus 4 additional apples that have grown since she put the original 6 back (since apples grow at a rate of 2 per day). Therefore, there are 6 + 4 = 10 apples in the tree now.
Response:  Racheal picked 3 apples from her tree and then put them back. So, initially there were 27 apples in the tree (including the 3 she picked). Now, there are 25 apples left in the tree (since 2 of the original 27 have been picked). Therefore, the number of apples in the tree is 25.
Response:  Rahul picked 7 apples from his tree and then 2 new apples grew on the same tree. So, after picking the initial 7 apples, there were 5 apples left on the tree (7 - 2 = 5). Now, after growing for some time, there are still 5 apples on the tree. Therefore, the number of apples that were initially present in the tree is 5.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 seeds in the tree. Then, the person picked 4 seeds from the tree and left 2 seeds behind. After that, 3 new seeds grew on the tree. So, now there are 2 + 4 = 6 seeds in total on the tree.
Response:  We know that Rakesh has 52 seeds in his bag and he picked one seed from it to plant in the ground. So, now there are 51 seeds left in the bag.  Then, he picked two seeds from the planted seed and kept them in his bag, so now there are 49 seeds left on the plant. Finally, we are told that there are still 7 seeds on the plant after Rakesh took away 2 seeds. Therefore, the number of seeds remaining on the plant is 7.  Hence, the answer is 7.
"Response: 
Rahul has three trees and he plucked one apple from each tree. So, in total, he had 3 x 1 = 3 apples.  Then, he plucked another 4 apples from each of the remaining two trees, so now he has 2 x 4 = 8 apples. Finally, he plucked 5 more apples from all the three trees, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 apples in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 13."
"Response: 
Rahul has 4 trees and he plucked 1 seb from each tree. So, he plucked total 4 sebs.  Now, after planting 7 sebs in each of his 4 trees, there are total 28 sebs (7 x 4 = 28). Therefore, Rahul plucked 4 + 28 = 32 sebs."
Response:  We know that there were initially 2 more balls in Ed's bag than in Doug's bag. So, the total number of balls in Ed's bag was 17 (2 + 15). Now, we are told that Ed kicked some of his balls out of the field during the game. Let's assume he kicked x balls out of the field. Since Doug had only 13 balls in his bag, and Ed had 17 balls in his bag before kicking any out, the difference between their initial numbers of balls is 4 (17 - 13 = 4). Therefore, after kicking x balls out of the field, Ed has 13 + x balls left in his bag, and Doug still has 13 balls in his bag. Finally, we are told that Ed now has 19 balls in his bag, which means that x + 13 = 19, or x = 6. So, Ed kicked 6 balls out of the field during the game.
Response:  We know that Ed had 10 more balls than Doug. So, if Ed had 45 balls in total, then Doug must have had 35 balls (10 less than Ed). Therefore, the difference between the number of balls Ed and Doug had is 45 - 35 = 10.
Response:  We know that there were initially 6 bulbuls in the field and Ed had killed 7 of them. So, the number of bulbuls left with Ed is 6 - 7 = -1. Now, if Ed had 22 bulburs, then he would have killed all of them, leaving none behind. Therefore, the number of bulbuls left with Dog is 0.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 5 more bulbuls in Ed's garden than in Dog's garden. So, if Ed had 30 bulbs and Dog had 27 bulbs, then the total number of bulbs in both gardens was:

Total no. of bulbs = Number of bulbs in Ed's garden + Number of bulbs in Dog's garden
= 30 + 27
= 57
Therefore, at the start, Dog had 27 bulbs."
Response:  We know that Ed has 9 balls and Doug has 27 balls in total. So, if we subtract Ed's balls from Doug's total number of balls, we get: 27 - 9 = 18. Therefore, there were 18 more balls with Doug than with Ed.
Response:  We know that Ed has 29 balls and lost 17 of them in the field. So, he now has 29 - 17 = 12 balls left with him. Now, we need to find out how many more balls Doog had than Ed. As per the question, Doog had 30 balls more than Ed. Therefore, if Ed had 12 balls, then Doog must have had 30 + 12 = 42 balls.
"Response:  We know that there were initially 19 dogs in the field and Ed lost some of them while playing fetch. Now, we are told that there are 8 more bulbulas than before. So, the total number of dogs left after Ed played fetch is:

Initially, there were 19 dogs = 19 x 4 (since each dog has 4 legs) = 76 legs
After losing some dogs, there were 8 more bulbulas = 8 x 4 = 32 legs
Total number of legs left after Ed played fetch = 76 + 32 = 108 legs
Now, since each leg belongs to one dog, the total number of dogs left after Ed played fetch is:
108 legs / 4 legs per dog = 27 dogs
So, Ed kicked 27 dogs into the air while playing fetch."
Response:  We know that Ed had 30 goblins in his army and he lost 21 of them in the game. So, the remaining goblins with Ed are 30 - 21 = 9. Now, we need to find out how many more bulbuls were there in Ed's army if he had 91 bulbuls in total. To do this, we can use the ratio of goblins to bulbuls given in the question: 1 goblin : 4 bulbuls. Therefore, if Ed had 91 bulbuls, then he had 91 / 4 = 22.75 goblins (round off to 23). So, there were 23 more bulbuls than goblins in Ed's army.
Response:  Ed had 12 balls in his bag and lost 4 of them while playing cricket in the ground. So, he has 8 balls left (12 - 4 = 8). Now, if Ed had 17 balls initially, then after losing 4 balls, he has 13 balls left (17 - 4 = 13). Therefore, there are 13 balls in Dog's bag.
Response:  If 408 students gave suggestions for different types of food and 42 students suggested something else in the menu, then the number of students who gave suggestions for Aloo Gobi is 408 - 42 = 366. So, out of these 366 students, 15 more students (i.e., 366 / 2 = 183) gave suggestions for Aloo Gobi than those who suggested something else in the menu.
Response:  If Sophia gave advice to 479 students and they followed it, then there are 479 x 1 = 479 students who took aloo as their preference.  Now, if 489 students gave the suggestion to eat menus, then there are 489 x 1 = 489 students who preferred menu over aloo. So, the difference in number of students preferring aloo over menu is 489 - 479 = 10. Therefore, out of the total 968 students, 10 more students preferred aloo than menu.
Response:  Soffia gave suggestions to 310 students regarding different types of food. Among them, 185 students suggested that they would like to have aloo (potato) in their meal, while others suggested that they would prefer menus (bread). Therefore, the number of students who preferred menus is 185 - 185 = 0. So, none of the students preferred beken (a type of bread).
Response:  Soffia gave suggestions to 288 students regarding different types of food. Among them, 264 students suggested beans as an alternative to rice in menu items. Therefore, the number of students who suggested beans as an alternative is 264.
Response:  Soffia gave advice to 457 students regarding food. Some of them suggested eating aloo (potato) in menu while others suggested beken (a type of vegetable). If 63 more students had given their opinion, how many would have suggested eating aloo in comparison to beken?
Response:  Soffia gave advice to students regarding different types of food for breakfast. Out of 182 students, 40 suggested eating aloo (potato) in their menu, while 57 suggested eating menus (bread). If 166 more students had given their suggestions and among them, 40 suggested eating aloo and 33 suggested eating menus, then how many students suggested eating menus?
Response:  Soffia gave advice to students regarding different types of food items that they should include in their meals. If 324 students followed her advice and included aloo (potato) in their meals, then 374 students advised menus with beken (a type of lentil soup) instead of aloo, and 128 students suggested including tomatoes in their meals, how many students did not follow Sofia's advice? Solution: The total number of students who did not follow Sofia's advice is 324 + 374 - 128 = 506. Therefore, 506 students did not follow Sofia's advice.
Response:  If Sofia gave advice to 257 students and suggested that they eat boiled eggs for breakfast, then among those who followed her advice, 120 students ate menus in their breakfast, 97 students ate tomatoes, and 40 students did not follow her advice. So, out of the total number of students who did not follow her advice (i.e., 40), how many more students ate boiled eggs than menus?  Therefore, the difference between the number of students who ate boiled eggs and menus is 30 ( i.e., 120 - 40).
Response:  If Sophia gave advice to 144 students and suggested that they eat more vegetables, then out of those 144 students, 467 students gave advice to eat more menus in their meals, and 79 students advised eating more tomatoes specifically. So, in total, 79 + 467 = 546 students advised eating something other than potatoes. Therefore, among the students who advised eating something other than potatoes, there are 546 - 79 = 467 students who advised eating more vegetables.
Response:  Soffia gave advice to students regarding different types of food items. If 228 students suggested potato peeling as their preference, and 337 students recommended menus for beken (a type of vegetable), then out of these 565 students, how many more students preferred tomato than those who preferred beken? Solution: To find out the number of more students who preferred tomato over beken, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred beken from the total number of students who preferred tomato. Therefore, the answer is: Number of more students = Total number of students who preferred tomato - Total number of students who preferred beken = 23 - 337 = -314 Now, since there are negative numbers, it means that more students preferred tomato than those who preferred beken.
Response:  Soffia gave suggestions to 66 students in total. If 450 students had taken the exam and 38 of them chose option A ( Aloo ki Pyuri Joondne Ka Suggestion), then the number of students who did not choose option A is 412 (450 - 38). Now, among those 412 students, some may have chosen other options, so let's say X number of students chose other options. Therefore, the number of students who did not choose any of the suggested options is 412 - X. Since all the options were equally likely, we can assume that each student chose one of the remaining options randomly. So, the probability that a particular student chose no option from the list is (412 - X) / 412.
Response:  Soffia gave advice to 218 students regarding different types of food. If 351 students suggested only Beekan in menu, then how many students suggested Beekan along with other food items? Therefore, the answer is 351.
Response:  Soffia gave advice to students regarding different types of food items that they should eat in the mess. If 269 students suggested beken jo dhone ka sujhaav diya (269 students recommended eating beken), and 330 students suggested aloo ki pyuri jodne ka sujhaav diya (330 students recommended eating potatoes), then how many more students recommended eating tomato than those who recommended eating beken?  We can see from the given information that 76 students recommended eating tomato, which is 41 more than the number of students who recommended eating beken. Therefore, the answer is 41.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can divide the number of girls by the number of boys: Number of girls = 569 Girls = Boys x (Number of girls / Number of boys) = 569/236 = 2.41 times as many girls as boys So, there are approximately 2.41 times as many girls as boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls in the school and 841 boys. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls:  Number of boys = 841 / 34 = 25  So, there are 25 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in the school and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 students in total and 228 more girls than boys. So, if we divide the number of girls (228) by the number of boys (469), we get:  Number of boys = Total number of students - Number of girls  Number of boys = 697 - 228 = 469 Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls in the school and 510 more boys than girls. So, the total number of boys = Number of girls + (Number of girls x 1.5). Therefore, the total number of boys in the school is: 635 + (635 x 1.5) = 927.5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a boy, the final answer is 928 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 students in total and 281 of them are boys. So, the number of girls = Total Students - Number of Boys. = 868 - 281 = 587 girls. Therefore, there are 587 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 students in total and among them, 142 more boys than girls. So, if we want to find out how many male students there are, we can use the following equation: Number of Male Students = Total number of students - Number of Female Students + Number of Boys excess over Girls. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of Male Students = 700 - 142 + x Where 'x' is the number of excess boys. Since there are 142 more boys than girls, the value of 'x' must be positive. Therefore, the number of male students in the school is:  Number of Male Students = 700 - 142 + 142 = 598  So, there are 598 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 706 girls and 222 boys in the school initially.  Then, 418 more girls join the school, so now the total number of girls is 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, the total number of boys remains unchanged at 222. Therefore, the total number of students in the school after the new admissions are: Number of girls = 1124 Number of boys = 222 Total number of students = Number of girls + Number of boys = 1124 + 222 = 1346 students.
Response:  We know that there are 902 girls in the school initially. Then, 44 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls now is:  902 + 44 = 946 girls in the school. Now, we need to find out how many boys are left in the school after 44 girls joined. The initial number of boys was 811, so the updated number of boys in the school is:  811 - (44 / 902) x 811 = 753 boys in the school. Therefore, the final number of students in the school is:  946 + 753 = 1699 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 632 girls in the school and 410 boys. So, the total number of students is 632 + 410 = 1042. Now, we are told that 465 more girls joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of girls in the school is 632 + 465 = 1097. Finally, we can find out the number of boys in the school by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students: 1042 - 1097 = -55. Hence, there are 55 boys in the school.
Response:  We know that in total there are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school.  Now we need to find out how many girls and boys are present after 8 new students joined the school. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total number of girls = 732 Number of girls who were already in the school = 682 New girls joining the school = 8 Therefore, the updated number of girls in the school is: 732 - 682 + 8 = 540 girls are now in the school. Similarly, we can calculate the number of boys as follows: Total number of boys = 761 Number of boys who were already in the school = 682 New boys joining the school = 8 Therefore, the updated number of boys in the school is: 761 - 682 + 8 = 499 boys are now in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in the school initially.  In total, there are 349 students (135 + 214) in the school. Now, 496 girls and 910 boys have taken admission, so the total number of students in the school after admissions is: Total no. of students = Initial no. of students + No. of new students = 349 + (496 x 2) = 349 + 988 = 1337 Students now study in the school. Therefore, there are 1337 students in the school, including both boys and girls.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 308 + 318 = 626. Now, we have to find out how many teachers are there in the school. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in the school. Therefore, the number of students per teacher is 626 / 36 = 17.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to find out how many teachers are teaching in the school. As per the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the ratio of teachers to students is 772 / 624 = 1.22.
Response:  We know that there are more than 402 boys in the school because if there were only 402 boys, then the total number of students would be 402 + 739 = 1141. So, there must be at least 402 boys in the school. Since we don't have any information about how many girls are in the school, let's assume that there are equal numbers of boys and girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the school is 402.
"Response:  We know that there are currently 458 students in the school and if we add 692 more students to it, then the total number of students will be:

Total Number of Students = 458 + 692 = 1150

So, there are 1150 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 362 boys in the school and 257 girls. So, the total number of students is 362 + 257 = 619. Now, we are told that 403 more girls joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of girls in the school is 257 (initial) + 403 = 650. Since the total number of students is now 619 + 650 = 1269. So, there are 250 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  Edvard had $ 18 initially and spent $ 16. So, he has $ 18 - $ 16 = $ 2 left with him.
"Response:  Edvard had $13 initially and spent some money. Now he has $3 left. So, the amount of money that Edvard spent is:
$13 - $3 = $10
Therefore, Edvard spent $10."
"Response: 
Adam spent $9 and then he spent another $8. So in total, Adam has spent $9 + $8 = $17.  Therefore, before spending his own money, Adam had $17 - $9 = $8."
"Response: 
Adam spent $16 on books and now has $6 left. So, he had $10 ($6 - $16) before spending money on books."
Response:  Advertisement bought two books for $6 each. So, in total, he spent $6 x 2 = $12 on buying both books. Therefore, the price of each book was $12 / 2 = $6 each.
Response:  Advertisement bought books for $6 and pens for $16. So, in total, he spent $22 ($6 + $16). Now, after selling his old things, he has $19 left with him. To find out how much money he had before spending on buying the books and pens, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $19 - $22 = -$3. Therefore, Advertisement had $3 less than what he initially had before spending any money.
Response:  Edvard spent $4 to buy books and $3 to buy pens. So he spent a total of $7 (4 + 3). Now he has $12 left after buying these items. Therefore, Edvard spent $5 (12 - 7) on books and pens combined.
"Response: 
Adam spent $16 on books and $8 on pens. So he had $19 left after buying those things. Now we need to find out how much more Adam spent on books than on pens. To do this, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount he had left:
$19 - $8 = $11
So Adam spent $11 more on books than on pens."
"Response: 
Adam spent $17 and then received $10 from his friend. So, Adam now has $7 left with him.  Therefore, the amount of money that Adam had before spending any money was $24 ($17 + $7)."
Response:  Zachary did 44 push-ups in one class period. David did more than Zachary and completed 58 additional push-ups. So, together they completed 92 push-ups (44 + 58 = 92).
Response:  According to the given information, Zachary scored 51 push-ups and David scored 44 push-ups today in their gym class. So, we can say that Zachary did more push-ups than David. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did, we need to subtract David's score from Zachary's score. Therefore, the difference between Zachary's score (51) and David's score (44) is 7. Hence, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  David did 44 push-ups in total and Zachary did more than him (Zachary did 9 more). So, Zachary did 53 push-ups (44 + 9 = 53).
Response:  David made 51 push-ups in class today and Zara made 49 more than him. So, Zara made 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups in total.
Response:  Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches today in gym class. David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary but did fewer crunches than Zachary. So, David did 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups and 27 - 44 = 23 crunches. Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 23 crunches today in gym class.
Response:  David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 44 push-ups, then David did (44 + 29) = 73 push-ups.
Response:  Zachary did 53 push-ups and David did 17 more than him, so David did 53 + 17 = 70 push-ups. However, Zachary did 14 crunches less than David, so Zachary did 14 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.
Response:  Zachary did 35 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary. So, David did 93 push-ups (58 + 35). Now, Zachary did 3 crunches while David didn't do any. So, Zachary scored 93 + 3 = 96 points in total. Therefore, Zachary crunched 96 - 35 = 61 more crunches than push-ups.
Response:  Zachary did 46 push-ups and David did 38 more than him. So, David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. Now, Zachary did 58 crunches while David did 62 less than him, which is 62 - 58 = 4 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 46 push-ups and 4 crunches.
Response:  David did 19 push-ups in class today. John did 13 push-ups less than David. So, John did 6 (19 - 13) push-ups. Therefore, David did 19 + 6 = 25 push-ups.
"Response:  David did 22 more push-ups than Zacheri and John did 4 less push-ups than David. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get:
Zacheri - 51 = David + 22 = John - 4 = Total push-ups done
So, John did 37 push-ups (4 + 22)."
Response:  David did 39 more push-ups than Zacheri. John did 9 less push-ups than David. So, if we subtract 9 from 39, we get 30. Therefore, Zacheri performed 30 more push-ups than John.
Response:  David made 30 more push-ups than Jime today. So, if David did 37 push-ups, then Jime must have done 37 - 30 = 7 push-ups.
Response:  David made 56 push-ups today in his gym class. If he had made 38 push-ups earlier, then together they would have done 94 push-ups (56 + 38).
Response:  David made 40 push-ups and then took a break before doing another set of 17 push-ups in class today. So, he did a total of 57 push-ups (40 + 17). If Jazzeri also did 34 push-ups and then took a break before doing another set of 62 push-ups, she would have done a total of 96 push-ups (34 + 62). Therefore, David did more push-ups than Jazzeri.
Response:  David made 36 push-ups today but scored only 33 in the class test. If Jiachi had 58 push-ups and gave up 33, how many more push-ups did she give up than David?  We know that Jiachi gave up 25 more push-ups than David (58 - 33 = 25). So, Jiachi gave up 25 more push-ups than David.
Response:  David made 27 push-ups today but scored only 7 less than Jim in the class. So, if Jim did 5 more push-ups and 17 fewer crunches than David, then how many push-ups did David do? We know that David did 27 push-ups, so he must have done x push-ups where x is the difference between his score and Jim's score. Since Jim scored 7 less than David, we can write an equation as follows: 27 - 7 = x ( since David scored 20 more than Jim) Now, let's substitute the value of x from the previous equation into the second one: 20 = x + 7 This means that David did 13 push-ups more than Jim. Therefore, the correct answer is: David did 13 push-ups more than Jim.
Response:  We know that Racheal had 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. So, in total, she had 7 pages of homework (5 + 2). Now, we need to find out how many questions were there in each subject. In math, there were 10 questions per page, so in total, there were 70 questions (10 x 7 = 70). Similarly, in reading, there were 5 questions per page, so in total, there were 10 questions (5 x 2 = 10). Therefore, the difference between the number of questions in math and reading is 60 (70 - 10)
Response:  We know that Racheal had 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. So, in total, she had 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework to complete.
Response:  If Racheal had completed 5 pages of her homework and then she had to do more pages, let's say 3 more pages, so in total she did 8 pages (5 + 3). Now if she had to do another 7 pages, that means she would have done a total of 15 pages (8 + 7). So, Rachel had done 15 pages of her homework.
Response:  Racheal had to complete 7 pages of her homework in mathematics. If she completed 4 pages of her own homework and the remaining 3 pages were from the textbook, then how many pages did she complete altogether?  Therefore, Rachel completed 7 - 4 = 3 pages of her homework.
Response:  Racheal had to complete 8 pages of math homework in total. If she completed 3 more pages than her math homework, then she completed 8 + 3 = 11 pages of math homework in total. Therefore, Rachel completed 11 pages of math homework in total.
Response:  We know that Racheal completed 8 pages of her homework in mathematics. If she had to complete an additional 6 pages of homework in mathematics compared to the previous week, then she would have completed 14 pages (8 + 6) of homework in total. Therefore, she would have completed 14/8 = 1.75 pages of homework per day.
Response:  We know that Racheal completed 10 pages of her homework in mathematics. If she had to complete an additional 3 pages beyond what was assigned for homework, then she would have completed a total of 13 pages (10 + 3). So, Rachel completed 13 pages of her homework in mathematics.
Response:  Rajesh had 2 pages of math homework, which he completed in 3 pages. Then, he had to do 10 more pages of biology homework. So, in total, Rajesh had to complete 15 pages (2 + 3 + 10) of homework.
Response:  We know that Racheal completed 9 pages of mathematics homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she completed is 9 + 2 = 11 pages. Now, we are asked to compare this with the number of pages she completed in her other subjects. According to the question, Rachel completed 96 pages of science homework and 90 pages of social studies homework. So, the total number of pages she completed in these two subjects is 96 + 90 = 186 pages. Finally, we need to find out how many more pages Rachel completed in mathematics than in her other subjects. To do this, we subtract the number of pages she completed in mathematics (11) from the number of pages she completed in her other subjects (186): 186 - 11 = 175 pages. Therefore, Rachel completed 175 more pages in her other subjects than she did in mathematics.
Response:  We know that Racheal completed 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension from her textbook. Therefore, she has completed 9 pages (11 - 2) of homework in total. Now, we are asked how many pages of biology homework Rachel completed if she had completed 3 more pages than she did for math homework. So, if Rachel completed 9 pages of math homework, then she must have completed 12 pages (9 + 3) of biology homework.
Response:  According to the question, Racheal had completed 7 pages of her math homework and wanted to know how many more pages she needed to complete the remaining 4 pages. So, the total number of pages in Rachel's math homework was 7 + 4 = 11 pages. Now, let's consider the science homework. The question states that Rachel had read 11 pages of her science homework and wanted to know how many more pages she needed to read to finish the remaining 8 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in Rachel's science homework was 11 + 8 = 19 pages.
Response:  Racheal had to complete 9 pages of math homework, which is equal to 9/1 = 9 assignments.  She also had to read and complete 11 pages of reading comprehension homework, which is equal to 11/1 = 11 assignments. Additionally, she had to finish 29 pages of biology homework, which is equal to 29/1 = 29 assignments. Therefore, in total, Rachel had to complete 9 + 11 + 29 = 59 assignments.
Response:  We know that Racheal had to complete 8 pages of homework in total, and she completed 7 pages of mathematics homework and 3 pages of biology homework. So, the number of pages of homework remaining for her to complete was 8 - 7 = 1 page. Now, we need to find out how many pages of each subject's homework Rachel had left to complete. Since she completed 7 pages of mathematics homework, she had 7 / 2 = 3 and half pages of mathematics homework left to complete. Similarly, since she completed 3 pages of biology homework, she had 3 / 2 = 1 and half pages of biology homework left to complete. Therefore, the total number of pages of homework remaining for Rachel to complete was 1 + 1 and half = 2 and half pages.
Response:  Racheal had to complete 5 pages of mathematics homework, which took her 10 pages of reading and notes to finish. To complete the biology homework, she spent 6 pages of reading and notes. Therefore, in total, Rachel spent (5 x 10) + (6 x 1) = 55 pages of reading and notes to complete all five assignments.
Response:  We have to compare the number of pages in two books and four books.  The first book has 200 pages, and we need to find out how many pages are there in the second book. So, the number of pages in the second book is 100 (since it has half the number of pages as the first book). Now, let's find out how many pages are there in four books. Since each book has 100 pages, the total number of pages in four books is 4 x 100 = 400 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in two books and four books is 400 - 100 = 300 pages.
"Response:  We know that Racheal had to read 4 pages of homework in total.  Of these, she completed 7 pages of biology homework and 19 pages of mathematics homework. So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel did not complete is:

Pages of Math Homework Not Completed = Total Pages of Homework - Pages of Biology Homework Completed
= 4 - 7
= 3
Therefore, there were 3 pages of math homework that Rachel did not complete."
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 6 emails and in the evening he received another 2 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is: 6 + 2 = 8 emails. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the evening and those he received in the morning is: 8 - 6 = 2 more emails.
Response:  On Sunday, Jack received 6 emails and on Wednesday he received 8 emails. So, in comparison to Sunday, Jack received more emails on Wednesday (8 - 6 = 2). Therefore, Jack received 2 additional emails on Wednesday compared to Sunday.
Response:  If Jack receives 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he will receive a total of 5 emails in one day. So, if he received 5 emails in a day, then he will receive 5/2 = 2.5 emails in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack will receive 2.5 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack received 6 emails and in the evening he received another 3 emails, making it a total of 9 emails for that day.  Now, let's calculate how many emails Jack received per hour:  Total number of emails = 9 Emails/Time taken to receive emails (in hours) = 9 / 1 = 9 emails per hour. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails per hour.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the evening for a total of 13 emails. So, he received 13 - 5 = 8 more emails in the evening than he did in the morning. Therefore, Jack received 8 x 2 = 16 emails overall.
Response:  On Sunday morning at 4 am, Jack received 2 emails. Then he did not receive any email for 6 hours (from 4 pm to 10 pm). So, in total, Jack received 2 + 0 = 2 emails on Sunday morning. Now let's move to Monday. In the evening (from 5 pm to 8 pm), Jack received 3 emails. And then again there is a gap of 6 hours (from 8 pm to midnight) during which Jack did not receive any email. Finally, in the last hour of the day (midnight to 1 am), Jack received 2 more emails. Therefore, the total number of emails that Jack received on Monday is 3 + 0 = 3 emails. So, the final answer is: 2 + 3 = 5 emails.
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack received 3 emails and in the evening he received another 4 emails, making it a total of 7 emails. Now, let's calculate how many emails Jack received during each time slot: Morning (10 AM - 2 PM): 3 Emails Evening (2 PM - 6 PM): 7 Emails Total number of emails received by Jack = 3 + 7 = 10
Response:  On Wednesday, Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 7 emails in the evening for a total of 17 emails. So, compared to the morning, Jack received 7 more emails in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails received by Jack in the morning and evening is 7.
Response:  On Monday morning at 9 am, Jack received 10 emails. In the afternoon at 3 pm, he received another 5 emails, making it a total of 15 emails. Now, let's calculate how many more emails Jack received in the evening compared to the morning: Total emails received in the evening = 7 - 10 = -3 Emails received in the evening are fewer than those received in the morning by -3 emails. Therefore, the answer is -3 emails.
Response:  On Monday morning at 10 am, Jack received 5 emails and in the evening he received another 4 emails. So, in total, Jack received 9 emails on Monday (5 + 4 = 9). Now, let's compare this with Tuesday's email count. According to the question, on Tuesday afternoon, Jack received 3 more emails, making it a total of 12 emails for the day (9 + 3 = 12). Therefore, the difference between Monday's and Tuesday's email count is 3 (12 - 9 = 3).
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 6 emails and in the evening he received another 3 emails. So, the total number of emails he received that day is 6 + 3 = 9 emails. Now, if he receives 10 emails in a day, then he will receive 2 more emails in the evening (since he already received 3 emails in the evening). Therefore, the number of emails Jack will receive in the evening is 2.
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters. After that, he received 5 emails and 54 letters in the evening. So, in one day, Jack received a total of = 3 + 5 = 8 emails and 118 letters.
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters. After that, he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the evening. So, in one day, Jack received a total of = 5 + 6 + 9 + 7 = 28 emails and letters. Therefore, the answer is 28.
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. After that, he received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon. So, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon and those he received in the morning is:  3 (afternoon) - 10 (morning) = -7  Therefore, the number of more emails Jack received in the afternoon than in the morning is 7.
Response:  On Sunday morning, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters. In the afternoon, he received 2 more emails and 7 more letters. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails and 8 + 7 = 15 letters in one day. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the afternoon and the number of emails he received in the morning is 8 - 6 = 2. Similarly, the difference between the number of letters Jack received in the afternoon and the number of letters he received in the morning is 15 - 8 = 7.
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack sent 6 emails and received 2 in return. Then he sent another 91 emails and received 74 in return that afternoon. So, in total, Jack sent 97 emails (6 + 91) and received 76 emails (2 + 74). Therefore, Jack received 0.78 emails per email he sent (76 / 97).
Response:  On Monday morning, Jack sent 4 emails and in the evening he sent another 6 emails, making it a total of 10 emails that day. So, Jack sent 10 emails in one day.
"Response:  If Jack received 9 emails in one day and he receives 7 emails in the morning, then he has received a total of 7 + 7 = 14 emails that day. Now, we are asked how many emails Jack will receive in the evening. Since it is mentioned that ""a little more"" emails were sent in the evening, let's assume that Jack received an additional 3 emails in the evening, taking the total number of emails he received that day to 14 + 3 = 17 emails."
Response:  On Wednesday, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning for a total of 8 emails. Now, let's compare this to Sunday when he received 16 emails. So, on Wednesday, Jack received 4 more emails than on Sunday (16 - 8 = 8). Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received on Wednesday and Sunday is 8.
Response:  We know that Jack receives 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning. So, the total number of emails he received in one day is: 3 + 6 = 9. If he received 10 emails in a day, then he would have received 2 extra emails in the evening (after 6 pm). Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the evening is: 2. So, the total number of emails Jack received in one day is: 9 + 2 = 11.
Response:  Tiddly (T) is 9 inches tall and Meenakshi (M) is 12 inches tall. So, if Tiddly stands in front of Meenakshi, M will be 3 inches taller than T. Therefore, Meenakshi is 15 inches tall (12 + 3).
Response:  Tiddly is 31 inches tall and Meenakshi is 35 inches tall. So, if they stand together, their combined height would be: Tiddly's height + Meenakshi's height = 31 + 35 = 66 inches. Therefore, they stood a total of 66 inches (or 5 feet 6 inches) tall together.
Response:  Tiddly (T) stood at 36 inches and moved away from Meenakshi (M).  Meenakshi (M) also moved towards Tiddly (T), but at a slower rate than Tiddly (T). So, after some time, Tiddly (T) was 17 inches ahead of Meenakshi (M). Now, we need to find out how far Meenakshi (M) moved in that time. We know that Meenakshi (M) moved at a speed of 1/2 the speed of Tiddly (T). Therefore, Meenakshi (M) moved 15 inches forward during that time. So, the distance between Meenakshi (M) and Tiddly (T) after that time is: Distance = 17 - 15 = 2 inches.
Response:  Tiddly (the cat) started at 0 inches away from the bird.  Meenakshi (the dog) started at 18 inches away from the bird.  So, after Meenakshi barked, she was 18 + 2 = 20 inches away from the bird.  Now, Chuha (the snake) started at 20 - 2 = 18 inches away from the bird. Therefore, Chuha is 18 inches away from the bird.
Response:  Tiddly (the cat) is 10 inches away from Teddy (the bear). Chuha (the dog) is 20 inches away from Teddy. So, the distance between Chuha and Tiddly is:  Distance = 20 - 10 = 10 inches. Therefore, Chuha is 10 inches ahead of Tiddly.
Response:  Tiddly (T) was 19 inches away from Mehndi (M).  Mehndi (M) was 39 inches away from Chuha (C).  So, the distance between Mehndi and Chuha is 94 - 39 = 55 inches. Therefore, Mehndi is 55 inches away from Chuha.
Response:  Tiddly (the cat) was 25 inches away from the tree. Meow (the dog) was 32 inches ahead of Tiddly and 26 inches below him. So, the distance between Meow and Tiddly is 32 - 26 = 7 inches. Therefore, Chuha (the mouse) is 7 inches away from Tiddly.
Response:  Tiddly (T) is 24 inches tall and Meenakshi (M) is 33 inches tall. Chuha (C) is 5 inches shorter than Meenakshi. So, Chuha is 33 - 5 = 28 inches tall. Therefore, Chuha is 28 inches tall.
Response:  Tiddlywink is 13 inches away from Teddy.  Teddy moves 2 inches towards Tiddlywink. So, now Tiddlywink is 15 inches away from Teddy (13 + 2). Now Meechak moves 4 inches towards Tiddlywink. So, Meechak is now 19 inches away from Teddy (15 + 4). Therefore, Meechak moved 9 inches (19 - 10) away from Teddy.
Response:  Tiddly and Muddle had an egg-tossing competition. Tiddly tossed the egg 35 inches. Then, he tossed it 4 inches away from him. So, how far did they throw the eggs in total?  Total distance = Distance between Tiddly and Muddle + Distance traveled by the egg = 4 inches (distance between them) + 35 inches (initial distance of the egg) = 39 inches
Response:  Tiddly (T) stood at 19 inches and Muffin (M) was 4 inches away from him. Therefore, the distance between Tiddly and Muffin was 19 + 4 = 23 inches. Now, Chuha (C) was 44 inches away from Muffin. So, the distance between Chuha and Muffin was 44 - 23 = 21 inches.
Response:  Tiddly (the cat) is 39 inches away from the tree.  The dog is 19 inches ahead of Tiddly and 12 inches below him. So, the distance between the dog and the tree is 19 + 12 = 31 inches. Therefore, Chuha (the dog) is 31 inches away from the tree.
Response:  We know that Tiddly was 21 inches away from Chuhe and Chuhe was 16 inches away from Tiddly. So, the distance between Tiddly and Chuhe is: Distance = 21 - 16 = 5 inches. Therefore, Tiddly is 5 inches away from Chuhe.
Response:  Mehandik (M) is 39 inches tall and Tiddi (T) is 17 inches tall. So, M > T in height. Now, let's find out how much more M is than T. We can do this by subtracting T's height from M's height: M - T = 39 - 17 = 22 inches. Therefore, Mehandik is 22 inches taller than Tiddi.
Response:  Tiddly (the cat) is 9 inches tall and Chuha (the dog) is 6 inches tall. So, the distance between them is:  Distance = Tiddly's height - Chuha's height = 9 - 6 = 3 inches. Now, we know that Chuha is 3 inches away from Tiddly. To find out how far Chuha is from Tiddly, we need to add the distance between them to Tiddly's height: Total distance = Tiddly's height + Distance = 9 + 3 = 12 inches. Therefore, Chuha is 12 inches away from Tiddly.
Response:  We know that Tiddlywink is 14 inches tall and Chuha is 16 inches less than Tiddlywink. So, Chuha's height is 14 - 16 = 8 inches. Now we are asked how much more Chuha is from Tiddlywink. Therefore, the difference between their heights is 8 - 14 = -6 inches. So, Chuha is 6 inches behind Tiddlywink.
Response:  Maa has already given 5 cups of atta to Baba earlier. Now, she is asking him for 9 more cups of atta (14 - 5 = 9). So, Baba needs to give 9 more cups of atta to Maa.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 4 cups of atta to her husband earlier. Now she wants to give him 9 more cups of atta and 11 more cups of chini. So, in total, she will give him 15 cups (9 + 11) of food items. Since he had already eaten 4 cups of atta earlier, now he needs 11 cups of atta (15 - 4).
Response:  The girl has already eaten some atta (6 cups) and now she wants to eat more (8 additional cups). So, in total, she needs 8 + 6 = 14 cups of atta.
Response:  The girl said that she has 11 cups of rice and wants to distribute them equally among 11 friends. So each friend will get one cup of rice. Now, if she needs to give an additional 2 cups of rice to 3 more friends, then she already gave 2 cups of rice earlier, so now she has 9 cups of rice left (11 - 2 = 9). Therefore, she can give 3 cups of rice to each of the remaining 3 friends (9 / 3 = 3).
Response:  Maa says she has 11 cups of rice and needs to make 6 more cups of rice for which she requires 3 more cups of water. So far, she has already boiled 3 cups of water. Now, if she wants to make 6 more cups of rice, how many total cups of water will she need?  Total number of cups of water needed = Number of cups of rice required + Water already used = 6 + 3 = 9 cups of water. Therefore, the answer is 9 cups of water.
Response:  Maa has already given 3 cups of atta (12 - 3 = 9 cups remaining). Now, she needs 2 more cups of atta. So, in total, Maa has given away 9 + 2 = 11 cups of atta. Therefore, the number of cups of atta that Maa has left is 11 - 3 = 8 cups.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 3 cups of atta and 62 cups of chini to her husband earlier. Now she wants to give him more atta and chini. To find out how many cups of each she needs to give, we can use the following formula: Number of cups of atta = Total amount of atta / Amount given earlier Number of cups of chini = Total amount of chini / Amount given earlier In this case, the total amount of atta is 90 cups (9 x 10) and the total amount of chini is 50 cups (5 x 10). So, to find out how many cups of atta and chini Mary needs to give to her husband, we can plug in these values into the formulas: Number of cups of atta = 90 / 3 = 30 cups Number of cups of chini = 50 / 62 = 0.8 (or about 8 cups) Therefore, Mary needs to give her husband around 30 cups of atta and about 8 cups of chini.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 10 cups of atta and 2 cups of chini to her mother-in-law. Now, she is asked how many more cups of chini she needs to give. To find out, we need to subtract the amount she has already given from the total amount required (14 cups - 10 cups = 4 cups). So, Mary needs to give 4 more cups of chini to her mother-in-law.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 11 cups of atta (flour) and now she is asked to give more. To find out how many cups of atta she needs to give, we need to subtract the number of cups she has already given from the total amount required. So, in this case, the total amount required is 12 cups - 11 cups = 1 cup of atta. Therefore, Mary needs to give 1 cup of atta more.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added 7 cups of atta to her mixture and now she wants to add more atta. Since she has already added 7 cups of atta, we can subtract this amount from the total quantity of atta available (10 cups). So, the remaining quantity of atta available for Mary to add is:

Remaining atta = Total atta - Amount already added = 10 cups - 7 cups = 3 cups

Now, we need to calculate how many cups of chini are required to make up for the remaining atta. Based on the information provided in the question, 2 cups of chini were used initially, and for every additional cup of atta, 80 cups of namak are required. Therefore, to make up for the remaining 3 cups of atta, Mary will require:

Chini required = Remaining atta x Ratio of chini to atta = 3 cups x 2/7 = 4 cups

So, Mary needs to add 4 cups of chini to her mixture to balance it out."
Response:  Maa has given 12 cups of rice and asked for 14 cups in return. She has already given 2 cups of rice earlier. Now, to find out how many more cups of rice she needs to give, we need to subtract the number of cups she has already given from the total amount required (14 - 2 = 12). So, Maa needs to give 12 more cups of rice.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 5 cups of atta to her husband earlier. Now she is being asked how many more cups of chini and namak are required to make 6 cups of kheer. So, we can deduce that the total amount of chini and namak needed for 6 cups of kheer is 8 cups (as mentioned in the question). Since Mary has already given 5 cups of atta, now she needs 3 more cups of chini and namak to make 6 cups of kheer. Therefore, the answer is 3 cups of chini and 3 cups of namak.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 2 cups of tea to her guests earlier. Now she wants to give them 12 cups more. So, in total, she will give them 14 cups (2 + 12) of tea. But we also know that there are 13 cups of Chinese food left, so Mary needs to give her guests 1 less cup of Chinese food than the number of cups of tea she is giving them. Therefore, Mary needs to give her guests 13 cups of Chinese food.
Response:  Maa has already given 4 cups of tea to Baba earlier. Now, she is asking him for 6 cups of tea and 9 cups of water. So, if we subtract the amount that Maa has already given (4 cups), then the remaining amount that Baba needs to give is: 6 - 4 = 2 cups of tea. Therefore, Baba needs to give 2 more cups of tea to Maa.
Response:  Maa has already given 2 cups of tea to Baba before he started counting. Now, she is giving him 1 cup every hour. So in total, she has given him 6 + 1 = 7 cups of tea so far. Since Baba wants to give 9 cups of tea to Maa, there are 2 more cups that he needs to give her now (9 - 7 = 2). Therefore, Baba needs to give Maa 2 more cups of tea.
Response:  We know that Mary has already filled 11 cups with atta (flour) and now she needs to fill 3 more cups. So, the total number of cups required to fill is 11 + 3 = 14 cups. Therefore, the answer is 14 cups.
Response:  Maa has already given 3 cups of tea to China and wants to give him another 10 cups. If she had given some tea earlier, then the total number of cups she gave is 3 + (10 - 5) = 8 cups. So, Maa gave 8 cups of tea to China in total.
Response:  Maa has already prepared 5 cups of tea using 13 cups of water and 1 cup of atta (chickpeas). Now she needs to prepare another 12 cups of tea. So, if she prepares 12 cups of tea in total, then she must have prepared how many cups of atta (chickpeas)?  We know that for every 4 cups of tea, she uses 1 cup of atta (chickpeas). Therefore, to find out how many cups of atta (chickpeas) she used, we can divide the number of cups of tea she prepared by 4: 12 cups / 4 = 3 cups. So, Maa used 3 cups of atta (chickpeas) to make 12 cups of tea.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 7 cups of atta and 60 cups of chini to her mother-in-law. Now, we are asked how many more cups of atta she needs to give to make up for the difference between what she had initially (6 cups) and what she actually gave (7 cups). So, the difference is equal to 6 - 7 = -1 cup of atta. Similarly, we can calculate the number of cups of chini needed as follows: The initial amount was 60 cups, and Mary gave 7 cups, so the remaining amount is 60 - 7 = 53 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to give an additional 53 cups of chini to her mother-in-law.
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 12 cups of atta and 10 cups of chini to her friend earlier. Now she wants to give more. So let's find out how many cups of each she needs to give now.  For atta, we need to subtract the amount she has already given (12) from the total amount required (11). So, Mary needs to give 9 more cups of atta.  Similarly, for chini, we need to subtract the amount she has already given (9) from the total amount required (11). So, Mary needs to give 2 more cups of chini. Therefore, the answer is:  Atte - 9 = 9 Chini - 9 = 2
Response:  Maa has already given 6 cups of atta (flour) earlier. Now she is being asked to give 10 more cups of atta for 3 kgs of rice. So, the total number of cups of atta that Maa needs to give = Total weight of rice / Weight of one cup of atta = 3 kg / 200 gms = 15 cups of atta. Therefore, Maa needs to give 9 more cups of atta (15 - 6 = 9).
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 4 cups of atta to her husband earlier. Now she wants to give him 14 more cups of atta for a total of 18 cups. So, we need to find out how many cups of atta are left after giving 14 additional cups.  Since there are 32 cups in a keg (as per the question), and Mary gave 4 cups earlier, the remaining amount of atta in the keg is: 32 - 4 = 28 cups. Therefore, Mary can now give her husband an additional 14 cups of atta, leaving her with 28 cups still in the keg.
Response:  Maa has already given 2 cups of atta to Baba before he started eating the noodles. Now, Baba needs 7 more cups of atta to complete his 9 cups. So, in total, Baba needs 9 - 2 = 7 cups of atta now.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already given 12 cups of atta (flour) and now she needs to give 9 more cups of atta to make 11 cups in total. So, the number of cups of atta left with her after giving 9 more cups is:

12 - 9 = 3

Now, we also know that for every cup of atta, Mary needs to give 6 cups of namak (salt). Since Mary has already given 6 cups of salt earlier, she needs to give an additional 9 cups of salt to make up for the remaining amount needed to fill 11 cups:

6 + 9 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 cups of namak (salt) left with Mary after giving 9 more cups of atta."
Response:  We know that Mary has already given 4 cups of tea to her friend earlier. Now she wants to give him another 3 cups (7 - 4 = 3). So, in total, Mary will give her friend 7 cups of tea.
Response:  Maa has already given 10 cups of tea to Baba earlier. Now, she is asking him for 12 cups of tea and 14 cups of milk. So, there is a difference of 2 cups of tea (12 - 10 = 2) and 2 cups of milk (14 - 10 = 4). Therefore, Baba needs to give 2 more cups of tea and 4 more cups of milk to Maa now.
"Response:  If there are 19 bird families that migrate to warm countries during winter and if each family has an average of 6 birds per family (which is a rough estimate), then we have:

Number of birds = Number of bird families x Average number of birds in each family
= 19 x 6
= 114

So, approximately 114 birds migrate to warm countries during winter from cold regions."
Response:  If 7 birds of 87 bird families migrate to warmer places during winter, then in comparison to those 7 birds, how many more birds from other 79 bird families would have migrated to warmer places if they had also migrated like the 7 birds that did migrate?  To find this out, we need to divide the total number of bird families (87) by 7, which gives us an average of around 12 bird families per group of 7 birds that migrated.  Therefore, the number of additional bird families that migrated to warmer places is equal to 79 - 12 = 67 bird families.
Response:  At first, there were 20 bird families in the mountains who migrated to warmer places due to cold weather. However, only 14 of these families returned to their nests in the mountains afterward. So, initially, there were 20 x 14 = 280 birds in the mountains.
Response:  If 23 birds from Africa and 37 birds from Asia migrate to the Himalayas, then the total number of bird families that would have reached the Himalayas is 23 + 37 = 60. Since there are 85 bird families living in the Himalayas initially, after migration, the remaining number of bird families in the Himalayas will be 85 - 60 = 25.
"Response:  If 42 birds from Africa migrate to another country and 31 birds from Asia migrate to Africa, then we have:
Number of African birds that migrated = 42
Number of Asian birds that migrated = 31
Total number of birds that migrated = Number of African birds + Number of Asian birds
= 42 + 31 = 73
Therefore, there are 73 more birds that migrated from Africa than from Asia."
"Response:  If 47 birds of one species migrate to Africa and 94 birds of another species migrate to Asia, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 47 - 94 = -47

So, there are 47 fewer birds that migrated to Africa compared to those that migrated to Asia."
Response:  If 18 bird families migrate to warm countries and 80 bird families migrate to Africa, then the total number of birds that migrate is: 18 x 38 = 652 birds + 80 x 4 = 320 birds = 972 birds. Therefore, approximately 972 birds migrate from cold regions to warm places during winter.
"Response:  If there are currently 87 parrot families living in the mountains and if 18 new parrot families have joined them, then the total number of parrot families living in the mountains will be:

87 + 18 = 105

So, now there are 105 parrot families living in the mountains."
"Response:  We know that there are 49 bird families in this region and 59 birds migrated to warmer places during winter. So, the total number of bird families in the region is:

49 + (59 x 1) = 49 + 59 = 108

Therefore, there were 108 bird families in the region before migration."
Response:  We know that 27 bird families migrated to warmer countries and 41 bird families stayed in the mountain range. So, if we assume that each family has an average of 3-4 members (which is a rough estimate), then: Total number of birds that migrated = 27 x 3 = 81 Total number of birds that stayed = 41 x 4 = 164 Therefore, there were 81 birds that migrated and 164 birds that stayed in the mountain range.
Response:  If there are 86 bird families living in the mountainous region and they have to migrate due to cold weather, then the number of birds that can fit in one tree is given by the product of the total number of bird families and the average size of each family.  Therefore, the number of birds that can fit in one tree = 86 x Avg. Size of Bird Family =?  Since we are told that the average size of a bird family is 4-5 members, we can assume that the average size of each family is 4.5 members (since rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us 5). So, the number of birds that can fit in one tree = 86 x 4.5 = 379 birds.  Now, if 45% of these birds migrate early, then the number of birds that migrate early = 379 x 0.45 = 167 birds.
Response:  If 35 birds of family A migrate to Africa and 62 birds of family B migrate to Asia, then we have: Family A (migrated): 35 birds Family B (migrated): 62 birds Total number of birds that migrated = 35 + 62 = 97 Now, let's find out how many more birds of family B migrated to Africa than family A migrated to Asia: More birds of family B migrated to Africa = 62 - 35 = 27 So, there are 27 more birds of family B that migrated to Africa than family A migrated to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are three bird families in the mountains - Eagles, Vultures and Falcons.  Out of these, two families have migrated to warmer climates due to cold weather - Eagles (10 families) and Vultures (5 families). So, the number of bird families remaining in the mountains is 7 (Falcons). Now, let's calculate the total number of birds in each family:  For Eagles, we have 10 families x 5 individuals per family = 50 eagles remaining in the mountains.  For Vultures, we have 5 families x 4 individuals per family = 20 vultures remaining in the mountains. And for Falcons, we have 7 families x 3 individuals per family = 21 falcons remaining in the mountains. Therefore, the total number of birds remaining in the mountains is 50 + 20 + 21 = 91 birds.
"Response:  If Polly had 253 pennies and spent them all in school year, then she must have spent $1.26 ($2.53 / $0.01). Since she did not spend all the money during the school year, there are some remaining pennies with her. So, the number of pennies Polly has after the school year is:

$$ \text {Number of pennies} = \text {Initial amount - Amount spent} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text {Number of pennies} = 253 - 1.26 = 249.74 $$

Therefore, Polly has 249 pennies left after the school year."
Response:  The box had 551 toys inside it and Polly had played with them for 6 months (3 months in school + 3 months outside of school). So, during that time, she had played with 551 / 6 = 92 toys per month. Now, since she stopped playing after 3 months, she had played with 92 x 3 = 276 toys altogether. Therefore, there are 276 - 177 = 99 toys left in the box for her birthday.
"Response:  We know that Polly gave 440 pencils to her friends for their birthday and she received 111 creative drawings in return. So, the number of pencils that Polly kept with herself is:

440 - 111 = 329

Therefore, Polly had 329 pencils left with herself."
Response:  We know that Polly gave 65 pencils to her friends and lost 16 of them during school year. So, the total number of pencils Polly had = 65 - 16 = 49 pencils. Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  The person has given 589 pencils to his friends for their birthday celebration and he himself wrote 161 creative writing pieces during that time period. So, the total number of pencils he gave away is 589 - 161 = 428 pencils.
"Response:  We know that Polly gave her friends 110 pencils for their birthday and lost 412 pencils during school year. So, the total number of pencils she had after giving them to her friends is:

110 - 412 = -302

So, Polly lost 302 pencils."
Response:  We know that Polly gave her friends 563 creative writing prompts during school year while she received 558 from them. So, if Polly had only 332 pennies, how many would she have received on her birthday? To find out, we need to divide the number of creative writing prompts she received (563) by the number of pennies she had (332). Therefore, Polly would have received 1670 pennies on her birthday.
Response:  We know that Polly gave her friends 52 creative writing prompts during school year while she received 535 from them. So, if Polly had only 492 pens, then how many pens did she give away or use for the creative writing prompts? To find out, we need to subtract the number of pens she used (492) from the total number of pens she received (535). Therefore, 535 - 492 = 43 pens were given away or used by Polly.
Response:  We know that there were initially 521 pents and 66 rubbers in the box. Since only 154 of them survived till the end of the school year, we can conclude that 367 pents (521 - 154) and 0 rubbers (66) died during this period. Therefore, the total number of pents that died is 367.
Response:  We know that Polly had 531 pennies and 38 rubber bands in total. At the end of the school year, she had only 391 pennies left, which means she gave away 140 pennies (531 - 391 = 140). Now, let's calculate how many rubber bands she gave away. Since she had 38 rubber bands initially, and at the end of the year, she had only 27 rubber bands left (38 - 27 = x), where 'x' is the number of rubber bands she gave away. Therefore, the answer to the question is 27.
Response:  We know that there are 601 pents and 406 rabbits in total.  In the end of the school year, only 336 rabbits survived. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits that Poll had given away as follows: Number of rabbits given away = Total number of rabbits - Surviving rabbits = 406 - 336 = 70 rabbits Therefore, Poll gave away 70 rabbits.
Response:  We know that Polly had only 291 friends in school because either 315 of them died or she gave away 24 (since it is not possible to have exactly 315 friends). So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of friends = 291  Now, let's find out how many pents Polly received for her birthday. Since there are 365 days in a year and Polly has only 291 friends, each friend will give her at most one present. Therefore, the total number of presents Polly received is equal to the number of days in a year minus the number of her friends:  Number of presents = 365 - 291  Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get:  Number of presents = 74  So, Polly received 74 presents for her birthday.
Response:  The box contained 267 pencils and Poll was able to give away 231 of them during the school year. So, he had 36 pencils left (267 - 231 = 36). Now, he gave away 308 pencils to his friends, which means he had 308 - 36 = 272 pencils left with him at the end of the school year.
Response:  We know that Polly had 457 rubber bands and 320 pencils initially. At the end of the school year, she gave away only 523 items (rubber bands + pencils). So, the number of rubber bands she gave away is: 457 - 523 = -166 rubber bands. Similarly, the number of pencils she gave away is: 320 - 523 = -203 pencils. Therefore, Polly gave away more rubber bands than pencils.
Response:  Initially, there were 11 customers in front of the weather man. After some time, 3 customers left him. So, the number of customers remaining in front of him is 11 - 3 = 8.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 customers. After some time, there were 4 customers. So, the difference between the number of customers who left and those who joined is 1 (4 - 3 = 1). Therefore, 1 customer left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers who left the water bottle. After that, there were 12 customers who came to buy water from him. So, initially, he had 9 customers.
Response:  We know that there were initially 14 passengers in the boat. Now, we are told that 5 of them have survived. So, the number of passengers who did not survive is 14 - 5 = 9. Therefore, there are still 9 passengers alive in the boat.
Response:  Initially, there were 13 customers. Then, 4 new customers arrived. So, the total number of customers now is 13 + 4 = 17. Therefore, 17 - 9 = 8 customers left.
Response:  Initially, there were 12 customers. Then, 15 more customers arrived, making it 27 customers in total (including both old and new). Finally, 14 new customers joined, leaving us with 41 customers altogether. So, the number of customers that are still present is 41.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 customers. Then, more customers arrived and there were 8 customers in total. So, the number of new customers who arrived is 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  Initially, there were 8 customers. After some time, 3 customers left, leaving 5 customers. Now, we are asked how many customers the water vendor gained if he had 99 new customers come in. So, the total number of customers the water vendor gained is 99 - 5 = 94 new customers.
Response:  Initially, there were 12 customers. After some time, 4 more customers joined. So, now there are 16 customers (12 + 4). Then, 10 new customers joined, so now there are 26 customers (16 + 10). Therefore, the number of customers that Water Man had after 10 new customers joined is 26.
Response:  Dan had $2 initially and spent it on buying a chocolate bar. After that, he got $3 back. So, his new balance is $5 ($2 + $3). Therefore, at first, Dan had $2.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spends $2 on chocolate bar. So he is left with $4 - $2 = $2. Now, he gives $3 to someone else. So, his remaining amount becomes $2 - $3 = $1. Therefore, the cost of the chocolate bar was $2.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys 99 chocolates at $3 each. So he spends a total of $327 (99 x $3). Now, he has only $327 left after buying the chocolates. But in the problem statement, it is mentioned that he spent an entire dollar ($1) on something else. So, we need to subtract $1 from $327, which gives us $326. Therefore, Dan has saved $326.
Response:  Dan has $3 and buys two chocolates for $4 each. So he spends a total of $8 (2 x $4). Now, we are told that the price of each chocolate is equal to one dollar. Therefore, the cost of each chocolate = $1. So, the cost of both chocolates = $2 ($1 + $1). Hence, the price of each chocolate bar was $2.
Response:  We know that Dan has $2 in his pocket and he bought some chocolates at $6 each with a price of $3 per piece. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total amount spent = Number of chocolate bars purchased x Price of one chocolate bar Now let's solve for the number of chocolate bars purchased: Number of chocolate bars = Total amount spent / Price of one chocolate bar Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of chocolate bars = $2 + ($6 x 3) = $2 + $18 = $20 Therefore, Dan bought 20 chocolate bars.
Response:  Dan has $7 and he spends $2 for one chocolate bar. So, his remaining money is $7 - $2 = $5. Now, he spends another $3 for another chocolate bar. So, his remaining money after this purchase is $5 - $3 = $2. Therefore, Dan has saved $2.
Response:  Dan has $4 and spends $7 on one chocolate bar. So he is left with $4 - $7 = -$3. Now, he buys another chocolate for $6, so he pays $6 + (-$3) = $3. Therefore, the total amount spent by Dan on both chocolates is $3.
Response:  Dan has $2 in his pocket and spends $6 on one chocolate bar and $3 on another chocolate. So he spent a total of $9 (6 + 3). Therefore, the amount he saved is $9 - $2 = $7.
Response:  Dan has $5 and he buys one chocolate for $2. So, his remaining balance is $5 - $2 = $3. Now, he buys another chocolate for $3. So, his total spending on both chocolates is $3 + $3 = $6. Therefore, the answer is $6.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys a chocolate bar for $8. So, he spends $8. Now his remaining money is $4 - $8 = $-4. His friend gives him $5, so now his balance is $5 + (-4) = $1. Therefore, Dan has $1 left after receiving $5 from his friend.
Response:  We know that Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on chocolate bars after buying one. So, his remaining balance is: $4 - $3 = $1. Therefore, he bought 1 chocolate bar for $3.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys 10 chocolates at $1 each. So he spends $10. Now he has $4 - $10 = $3 left.
Response:  Dan has $3 and he bought 2 chocolates for $1 each. So, he spent a total of $2 = $3 - $1 x 2 (for 2 chocolates). Therefore, the price of each chocolate bar was $1.
Response:  Dan spent $3 on a chocolate and $7 on a candy bar. So he spent a total of $10. Now we need to find out how much money Dan saved after buying these items. To do this, we will subtract the amount he spent from his initial balance of $5. Therefore, the amount of money Dan saved is: $5 - $10 = -$5. So, Dan did not save any money after buying the chocolate and candy bar.
Response:  Dan spent $7 to buy one chocolate and $2 to buy one candy bar. So he spent a total of $9 ($7 + $2). Therefore, the answer is (D) $9.
"Response:  We know that Pol had 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them in an off-the-cuff sale. So, the number of books left with Pol is:

Number of books left with Pol = Total number of books - Number of books sold
= 115 - 78
= 37

Therefore, there are 37 books left with Pol."
Response:  At first, there were 137 books in the bag. After that, he reduced it to 105 books. So, initially, there were 137 - 105 = 32 books in the bag.
Response:  Initially, there were 108 books in the box. After selling some of them in the garage sale, he had 62 books left. So, the number of books sold = 62 - 108 = 46 books.
Response:  We know that Pol had 50 books initially and then he sold some of them in an auction to raise funds for his trip. After selling some of the books, he had 151 fewer books than he initially had. So, if he initially had 50 books, then after selling some of them, he had x books where x is the difference between 50 and 151 (i.e., 101). Therefore, Pol bought x = 101 books during the auction.
Response:  Initially, there were two books in Pol's possession. After selling some of them in an auction, he bought 150 new books. So, initially, Pol had 2 books and after buying new ones, he has 58 books now. Therefore, Pol sold 72 books (2 - 58) in the auction.
Response:  Initially, there were 21 books in Pol's collection. After buying some new ones, he had 42 new books. If now he has only 15 books left, then he must have sold/bought 27 (42 - 15) additional books. So, Pol sold/bought 27 more books than the number of books he initially had. Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  Pol had 71 books initially and sold some of them to gain profit. After selling those books, he bought new ones, so his total number of books increased to 116. Now, if he sold some more books after buying new ones, then the difference between the number of books he sold and the number of books he bought is equal to the initial number of books he had. Therefore, the number of books he sold = 71 - (new books purchased) = 71 - 38 = 33.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in an off-campus book fair, he had 66 books and 59 pens left with him. So, the number of books sold in the off-campus book fair is: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Remaining number of books = 108 - 66 = 42 books Therefore, Pol sold 42 books in the off-campus book fair.
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some of them in an off-the-shelf sale, he was left with 82 books and 14 pens. So, the number of books sold in the off-the-shelf sale is: Number of books sold = Total number of books available for sale - Remaining number of books after the sale = 82 - (51 + 106) = 82 - 157 = -75 books Sold In the off-the-shelf sale, Pol sold -75 books.
Response:  Poll had 136 books initially and he sold some of them in an off-the-cuff sale. Let's assume that he sold half of his books (68 books). Now, if he has 27 books left with him, then he must have had 41 books (68 - 27 = 41) before selling any books. So, out of the initial 136 books, Poll sold 68 books, which means he has 68 / 2 = 34 books left with him after the sale.
Response:  Initially, there were 134 books in Pol's collection. He gave away 39 books to his friend. So, after giving away those books, Pol had 95 books left (134 - 39 = 95). Then, he sold some of these books in the garage sale and earned $270. After selling those books, Pol had 68 books left (95 - 270 = 68). Therefore, Pol sold 31 books ($270 / $8.5 = 31) in the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Pol had 95 pens and 153 books initially. After selling some of his books and pens, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, the number of books Gairraj sold is equal to the difference between the total number of books he had (153) and the number of books he was left with (13). Therefore, the answer is:
Gairraj sold 140 books."
Response:  We know that initially Pol had 42 books and 143 pens. After selling some of his books and pens, he was left with 113 books and 19 pens. So, the number of pens sold by Pol is: Number of pens sold = Total pens he had - Pens he was left with = 143 - 19 = 124 pens.
Response:  Jesika had 10 flowers in her vase initially. She cut 3 more flowers from her own garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are 10 + 3 = 13 flowers in the vase.
Response:  Jesika had 16 flowers in her bouquet and she gave 4 of them to Flower Dan. So, after giving those flowers to Flower Dan, Jesika had 16 - 4 = 12 flowers left in her bouquet. Now, there are 23 flowers in Flower Dan's bouquet, including the ones that Jesika gave him. Therefore, the number of flowers in Flower Dan's bouquet before Jesika gave him any was 23 - 4 = 20 flowers.
Response:  Jesika had 2 gulabs in the flower pot and gave 4 more to fill the pot. So, initially, there were 6 gulabs in the pot (2 + 4). Then, she cut some of her own flowers to make room for new ones, leaving 23 gulabs in the pot afterward. Therefore, Jesika cut 17 gulabs (23 - 6) from the pot.
Response:  Jesika had 15 flowers in her vase initially. She removed 33 flowers from the vase and threw them away. Now, there are 17 flowers left in the vase. To calculate how many more or fewer flowers were thrown away than kept, we need to subtract the number of flowers kept (17) from the total number of flowers removed (33). Therefore, the difference is 33 - 17 = 16. So, Jesika threw away 16 more flowers than she kept.
Response:  Jesika took 34 flowers from the garden and gave some of them to others to cut. So, there are now fewer flowers in the garden than before. The number of flowers that Jesika herself cut is equal to the number of flowers she gave away minus the number of flowers she received back. Therefore, the number of flowers Jesika cut = Number of flowers given away - Number of flowers received back.  In this case, Jesika gave away 34 flowers and received back 15 flowers, so the number of flowers Jesika cut = 34 - 15 = 19.  Hence, Jesika cut 19 more flowers than she gave away.
Response:  Jesika had 7 flowers in her bag initially (4 + 3). She picked some more flowers from the garden and gave 18 to her friend (4 x 4 = 16). So, she has 7 - 16 = 9 flowers left. Therefore, she cut 21 flowers (9 - 20 = 1).
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 13 gulabs in her bag and she cut some of them to make it 12. So, initially, there were 12 gulabs in the bag. Now, if we add the number of gulabs that were already in the garden (21), then the total number of gulabs in both places is 33. Therefore, the number of gulabs that remained in the bag after Jesika emptied it into the garden is 0.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 15 gulabs and 62 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of them to make more space for new plants. After cutting, she had 17 gulabs and 96 orkids in her garden. So, the number of gulabs that Jesika cut was:  Number of gulabs before cutting = 15 Number of gulabs after cutting = 17 Difference between the two numbers = 17 - 15 = 2 Therefore, Jesika cut 2 gulabs.
Response:  Jesika had 12 flowers and 2 orchids in her garden initially. She cut some of them to make more space for other plants. After cutting, she had 10 flowers and 21 orchids in her garden. So, the number of orchids that Jesika cut was 21 - 2 = 19.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 5 gulabs and 3 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of her flowers to make more space for new plants. After that, there are 12 gulabs and 2 orkids in the garden now. So, we can say that Jesika has added 7 gulabs (12 - 5) and 1 orkid (2 - 3) after cutting some of her original plants. Therefore, there are 7 additional gulabs and 1 additional orkid in the garden now.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 7 gulabs and 12 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of them to make more space for new plants. After that, there are now 11 gulabs and 20 orkids in the garden. To find out how many more orkids are there than gulabs, we need to subtract the number of gulabs from the total number of plants (or kids). So, the difference between the number of orkids and gulabs is: 20 - 11 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more orkids than gulabs in Jesika's garden now.
Response:  At first, Jessica had 20 flowers in her garden and she cut 5 of them to make garlands. So, now there are 15 flowers left in the garden. Then, she added 19 more flowers to the garden. If she started with 3 flowers initially, then she must have cut 16 flowers (3 + 16 = 19) to add those new ones to the existing ones in the garden. Therefore, Jessica cut 16 flowers to make room for the new ones.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 13 gulabs and 84 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of them to make more space for other plants. After cutting, she had 91 orkids and 14 gulabs left in her garden. So, the number of gulabs that Jesika cut was 14 - 13 = 1.
Response:  Jesika had 16 flowers and 3 oranges in her garden. She cut some of them to make more space for other plants. After cutting, she had 7 oranges and 13 flowers left. So, she cut 10 oranges (16 - 7 = 9) and 10 flowers (13 - 3 = 7).
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 6 gulabs and 20 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of her flowers to make more space for new plants. After that, there are now 21 orkids and 22 gulabs in the garden. So, we can see that after cutting some of her flowers, Jesika has got 5 more orkids (21 - 20 = 5) and 3 more gulabs (22 - 20 = 3). Therefore, there are 5 more orkids than gulabs in the garden.
Response:  Firstly, Jesika had 9 gulabs and 6 orkids in her garden. Then she cut some of them to make more space for new plants. After that, there are 13 orkids and 3 gulabs in the garden now. So, the number of orkids increased by 4 (13 - 9 = 4). Therefore, there are 4 more orkids than gulabs in the garden now.
Response:  Initially, Robin had 17 inches long hair. He cut some of his hair, and now he has 13 inches long hair. So, if he initially had 17 inches long hair, then he must have cut 4 inches (17 - 13 = 4) from his hair.
Response:  If Robin cut off 20 inches of Robert's hair before cutting it to 10 inches long, then initially Robert had 30 inches (20 + 10) of hair. So, initially his hair was 30 inches long.
Response:  Initially, Robin had 16 inches long hair. He cut 11 inches off it. So now he has 5 inches of hair left (16 - 11 = 5). Then, his hair grew back to 12 inches again. So after the second cutting and growing process, Robin has 5 + 12 = 17 inches of hair left.
Response:  If Robin's hair was previously 19 inches long and it grew by 1 inch, then his new length would be: 19 + 1 = 20 inches. So, now his hair is 20 inches long.
"Response:  If Robin cut off 13 inches of hair from Robyn's balloons, and initially they were 14 inches long, then the length of Robyn's hair after cutting is:

Length of hair = Initial length - Amount cut
= 14 inches - 13 inches
= 1 inch

So, Robyn's hair are now 1 inch long."
Response:  Initially, Robin had 14 inches long hair. Then it grew to 8 inches more, making it 22 inches long (14 + 8 = 22). Finally, he cut his hair to 20 inches, so now his hair is 20 inches long. Therefore, Robin's hair length is 20 inches.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 bottles in Danie's collection and he found 53 bottles in the park. So, the total number of bottles Danie has is:

12 (in his collection) + 53 (found in the park) = 65

So, Danie has 65 bottles in total."
Response:  We know that there are 21 bottles in Danie's collection and he found some more bottles in the park. So, let's assume that he found x more bottles in the park. Therefore, the total number of bottles Danie has is 21 + x. Now, we are told that if Danie had 53 bottles, then the number of bottles he found in the park is 53 - (21 + x). Since x is a positive integer, we can simplify the equation as follows: 53 - (21 + x) = 0. Solving for x, we get: x = 32. Therefore, Danie found 32 additional bottles in the park.
Response:  We know that Danie had 63 bottles in the park and he threw away 51 old ones. So, now he has 33 bottles left. To find out how many bottles Danie had initially, we can divide the total number of bottles he had (63) by the number of bottles he had after throwing away some (33). Therefore, Danie had 63 / 33 = 20 bottles initially.
Response:  We know that Danie parked his car in a parking lot with 36 booths and left for 35 minutes. After returning, he found that there were only 22 booths available. So, during the time he was away from his car, 14 booths (36 - 22 = 14) were taken by other cars.
"Response:  We know that Danie took away 30 bottles from the park and left it with 63 bottles remaining. Now, we have to find out how many more bottles he took away than what was in the park initially. So, let's subtract the number of bottles he left (63) from the initial number of bottles in the park (100):

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ bottles\ taken\ away = 100 - 63 = 37 $$

So, Danie took away $37$ more bottles than were present in the park initially."
Response:  We know that Danie initially had 22 bottles and 8 packets in his park. Now he has 28 bottles and 63 packets in his collection. So, to find out how many bottles Danie had earlier, we can subtract the number of bottles he already had (22) from the total number of bottles he now has (28): 28 - 22 = 6. Therefore, Danie had 6 bottles more than what he initially had.
Response:  We know that Danie had 22 bottles of top and 30 packets in the park. Now there are 17 bottles of tops and 57 packets in his collection. So, initially, Danie had 22 + 30 = 52 items.
Response:  Danie took 30 bottles of top and put them in his bag. Then he went to the park and found 14 more bottles there. So, now he has 30 + 14 = 44 bottles with him. Later, he added 7 more bottles to his collection, which means he now has 44 + 7 = 51 bottles. Therefore, Danie has taken more than 30 bottles from the park. The correct answer is (More than 30).
"Response:  We know that Danie park has 11 bottles and 28 packets in total. Now there are 68 bottles and 51 packets in the collection. So, we can calculate the difference between the two collections as follows:

Difference = Total number of bottles in new collection - Total number of bottles in old collection
= 68 - 11
= 57

Similarly, we can calculate the difference between the total number of packets in the new collection and the total number of packets in the old collection as follows:

Difference = Total number of packets in new collection - Total number of packets in old collection
= 51 - 28
= 23

Therefore, there are 57 more bottles and 23 more packets in the new collection than in the old collection."
Response:  We know that Danie initially had 71 bottles of top and 24 packets in his bag. After he distributed some of them among friends, he now has 28 bottles of tops and 16 packets in his bag. To find out how many more bottles Danie has than what he initially had, we need to subtract the number of bottles he initially had from the current number of bottles he has:  Number of bottles Danie has now = 28 - 71 = -43 So, Danie has 43 fewer bottles than what he initially had.
Response:  We know that Danie initially had 10 bottles and packed 62 packets in his bag. Now he has 27 bottles and 43 packets in his collection. So, the total number of packets Danie has now is:  Number of packets = Total number of bottles x Number of packets per bottle  In this case, the number of packets per bottle is 6 (as there are 6 packets in each of the 10 bottles). Therefore, the total number of packets Danie has now is:  Total number of packets = 27 x 6 = 152 packets  So, Danie has 152 more packets than he initially had.
Response:  We know that Danie threw away 41 bottles from his collection of 66 bottles. So, after throwing away those bottles, he had 66 - 41 = 25 bottles left in his collection.
Response:  We know that there are 32 bottles in total and initially, there were 25 bottles in the park. So, we have to find out how many more bottles were added later. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of additional bottles = Total number of bottles - Initial number of bottles = 32 - 25 = 8 Therefore, there were 8 more bottles added to the park after the initial 25 bottles were already present.
Response:  We know that Danie had 60 old people in his park and he killed them all. Now, there are 58 new people in the park. So, the total number of people in the park is 60 + 58 = 118. Since Danie has 67 bottles in his collection now, we can infer that he must have collected 67 - 118 = -51 bottles from the new people in the park. Therefore, Danie had 51 bottles in his collection before he started killing people in the park.
Response:  Danish had 30 bottles of liquor in his bag and gave away 6 to old people in the park. Now he has 24 bottles left (30 - 6 = 24). He then met new people and gave away 50 bottles to them. So now he has 74 bottles left (24 + 50 = 74). Therefore, the number of bottles of liquor that Danish gave away outside the park is 50.
"Response:  Danie took away 54 bottles from old people and gave 48 new bottles to them. So, there are 52 bottles left in his collection now. To find out how many more bottles he has taken away from the park, we need to subtract the number of bottles he gave to the old people from the total number of bottles he had initially. Therefore, the answer is:

More bottles taken away = Total initial bottles - Number of bottles given to old people
= 52 - 48
= 4
So, Danie took away 4 more bottles from the park than he gave to the old people."
Response:  We know that Danie took out 29 bottles and 82 packets from the park. Now there are 42 bottles and 61 packets in his collection. So, initially, Danie had 29 + 82 = 111 objects. Therefore, the number of bottles he had initially was 42 - 29 = 13.
Response:  We know that Danie had 66 packets and 39 bottles in the park. Now he has 16 bottles and 68 packets. So, initially, Danie had 66 + 39 = 105 items.
Response:  We know that Danie took out 46 packs and 50 bottles from the park. Now there are 21 bottles in his collection. So, we can calculate the number of bottles he left behind as follows: Number of bottles left behind = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles taken away = 50 - 21 = 29 bottles. Therefore, Danie left behind 29 bottles in the park.
Response:  We know that Danie park has 65 packets and 5 bottles in total. Now, we have found 31 bottle caps and 9 packets in the collection. So, the number of packets left in the park is equal to the number of packets found minus the number of packets collected = 9 - 31 = -22 packets. Therefore, there are 22 more packets than what was found in the park.
Response:  We know that Danie had 58 bottles of top and packed 25 packets in his bag. Now he has 11 packets and 12 bottles left. So, initially, Danie had 58 - 25 = 33 packets and 58 - 12 = 46 bottles. Therefore, Danie now has 11 + 46 = 57 packets and 12 + 46 = 58 bottles.
Response:  We know that Danie initially had 15 bottles and 18 packets in the park. Now, he has collected 67 packets and 35 bottles from the same park. So, the total number of packets Danie has now is: 67 + 18 = 85 packets. Similarly, the total number of bottles Danie has now is: 35 + 15 = 50 bottles. Therefore, the difference between the number of packets Danie had initially (85 - 18) and the number of bottles he had initially (50 - 15) is: 85 - 50 = 35 packets.
Response:  We know that Jack has 11 apples and he wants to trade them with Steve who has 17 apples. So, we need to find out how many apples Steve will get from Jack in exchange for his 17 apples. To do this, we can divide the number of apples Jack has (11) by the number of apples Steve has (17). This gives us: Number of apples Steve will get = 11 / 17 = 0.64 Therefore, Steve will get 64 apples from Jack in exchange for his 17 apples.
"Response:  We know that Jack has 7 acres of land and there are 14 more acres in his village than in the station. So, the total number of acres in the village is:

Village area = Station area + Jack's area
= 14 + 7
= 21

Now we know that Jack has 15 acres of land in total. Therefore, the number of acres he has in his village is:

Jack's village area = Total area of Jack - Area outside Jack's village
= 21 - 14 (as all the remaining areas are outside Jack's village)
= 7

So, Jack has 7 acres of land in his village."
Response:  We know that Jack has 18 acres of land and 13 more than him are in his village. So, the total number of acres in the village is: 18 + (13 x 2) = 47 acres. Now we know that there are 19 acres in Station. Therefore, the difference between the number of acres in Station and the number of acres in the village is: 47 - 19 = 28 acres. Hence, the number of acres owned by Jill is 28 acres.
Response:  We know that there are 3 less than Jack in station and 8 more than Jack in village. So, if we subtract 3 from the total number of people in the station, we get: Station population = 10 (given) - 3 = 7 Now, let's find out how many more people there are in the village than in the station: Village population = 20 (given) - 7 = 13 Therefore, there are 13 more people in the village than in the station.
"Response:  Jack has 12 apples and there are 11 more apples in his village than in Jack's station. So, the total number of apples in Jack's village is:

Total no. of apples in Jack's village = Number of apples in Jack's station + Number of more apples in the village than in Jack's station
= 4 + (11 - 4)
= 4 + 7
= 11
Therefore, there are 11 more apples in Jill's jack than in Jack's station."
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 less than Steve and 9 more than the village. So, if Steve has x adjoints, then Jack has x - 7. Similarly, if the village has y adjoints, then Jack has y + 9. Now we are given that there are 16 adjoints in total. Therefore, we can write an equation: x - 7 = 16... (1) And similarly, we can write another equation: y + 9 = 16... (2) Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and y using these equations?
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 more apples than Steve and he has 17 apples in total. So, Steve has x - 7 = 10 apples (where x is the number of apples Jack has). Now we know that Jack has 7 more apples than Steve, so Jack has x + 7 = 24 apples (since Steve has 10 apples). Therefore, Jill has 24 - 8 = 16 apples.
Response:  We know that Jack Station has 9 less than Adaroo from Jil and Adaroo from Jil is 18 more than Adaroo at Jack Station. So, we can write an equation as follows:  At Jack Station, there are 16 Aadroos. Now let's find out how many more Aadroos are in the jil compared to Jack Station. We can do this by subtracting 9 (the difference between Adaroo at Jack Station and Adaroo from Jil) from 18 (the difference between Adaroo from Jil and Adaroo at Jack Station):  Therefore, there are 9 + 9 = 18 more Aadroos in the jil compared to Jack Station.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 more acres than Jill. So, if Jill has x acres of land, then Jack has x + 6 acres of land.  Now we are told that there are 18 more acres in the station than in the village. Therefore, the total number of acres in the station is:  Total area of station = Total area of village + Number of extra acres in the station = x + 6 + 18 =?  Substituting the value of x from the problem statement, we get:  Total area of station = x + 6 + 18 = 20  Therefore, Jack has 20 - 6 = 14 more acres of land than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jack has 5 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jack has x + 5 apples.  Now we are told that there are 18 more apples in the station than in the village. Therefore, the total number of apples in the station is x + 18.  If Jill has 87 apples, then she has x - 18 apples less than the total number of apples in the station. So, Jill has (x + 18) - 87 = 69 apples.  Thus, Jake has 69 + 5 = 74 apples more than Jill.
Response:  We know that Jack has 16 more apples than Jill. So, if Jill has x apples, then Jack has x + 16 apples. Now we are given that Jill has 12 apples less than Jack. So, the difference between the number of apples held by Jack and Jill is equal to 12. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 16 = (x - 12)  Simplifying the above equation, we get:  x = 28  So, Jill has 28 apples and Jack has 44 apples.
Response:  We know that Jack has 12 less apples than Steve and 79 more seeds than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and y seeds, then Jack has x - 12 apples and y + 79 seeds. Now we can find out how many apples and seeds Jack has by substituting the values given in the question:  x = 19 (Steve's apples) x - 12 = 12 (Jack's apples) y = 14 (Steve's seeds) y + 79 = 83 (Jack's seeds) Solving for x and y, we get: x = 19 (Steve's apples) x - 12 = 12 (Jack's apples) = 7 Apples Y = 14 (Steve's seeds) y + 79 = 83 (Jack's seeds) = 65 Seeds Therefore, Jack has 7 apples and 65 seeds.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 less apples than Steve and he has 3 more seeds than Steve. So, if Steve has x seeds, then Jack has x - 13 seeds. Also, we know that Jack has 9 more apples than Steve, so the number of apples Jack has is 9 + x = 21. Therefore, the number of seeds Jack has is x = 21 - 9 = 12.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 less apples than Steve and 8 more seeds than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and seeds, then Jack has x - 6 apples and x + 8 seeds. Now we are told that Jack has 24 apples and 30 seeds in total. Therefore, Steve must have had x = 24 + 8 = 32 apples and seeds.
Response:  We know that Jack has 3 less apples than Steve and 10 more seeds than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples and seeds, then Jack has x - 3 apples and x + 10 seeds. Now we are given that there are 12 apples in total in the station, so the sum of all the apples in the station is 12x. Similarly, since there are 15 seeds in total in the station, the sum of all the seeds in the station is 15(x + 10). Solving for x, we get x = 40. Therefore, Jack has 40 apples and 50 seeds.
Response:  We know that Steve has 12 apples and Jack has some apples less than Steve. So, let's say Jack has x apples. Since Jack is located 4 km away from Steve, he has 67 more apples than what Steve has. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of Apples = 12 + (x - 4) Now, we need to find out how many apples Jack has. Substituting the value of x in this equation, we get: Number of Apples = 12 + (-3) = 9 So, Jack has 9 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 18 apples in Steve's basket and he has given 12 of them to Jack. So, now Steve has 6 apples left (18 - 12 = 6). Now we know that Jack has 8 more apples than Steve. Therefore, the total number of apples Jack has is 8 + 6 = 14 apples. Hence, the answer is 14 apples.
Response:  We know that Steve has 19 apples and Jack has fewer apples than Steve. So, we can say that Jack has x apples where x is less than or equal to 19. Now, let's compare this with the information given in the passage. According to the passage, Jack has 72 more apples than Steve. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 72 = 19 (x is the number of apples possessed by Jack) Substituting the value of x from the previous equation into this one, we get: x + 72 = 19 x = 13 Since x is less than or equal to 19, we can conclude that Jack possesses 13 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 14 apples in Steve's basket and he has given 6 of them to Jack. So, now Steve has 14 - 6 = 8 apples left. Now, we know that Jack has taken 3 more apples from Steve than he gave to him. So, Jack has taken 3 + 6 = 9 apples from Steve. Therefore, the number of apples Jack has is 9.
Response:  We know that Jack has 84 seeds and 10 addu. So, he has 84 + 10 = 94 seeds in total. Now, we are told that there are 13 addu and 52 sebs in Jack's farm. Since an addu is equal to 4 sebs, we can convert the number of addu into the number of sebs as follows: 13 addu x 4 sebs/addu = 52 sebs. Therefore, Jack has 94 seeds - 52 sebs = 42 seeds left after giving some away.
"Response:  We know that Jack has 13 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has x apples, then Jack has x + 13 apples. Also, we know that Jack has fewer seeds than Steve. So, if Jack has y seeds, then Steve has y - 8 seeds. Now, we can set up an equation based on these conditions:
x + 13 = y - 8... (1)
Now, let's solve for y (the number of apples in Jack's possession):
y = x + 13 - 8... (2)
Substituting x from the problem statement into equation (2), we get:
y = 13 + 5 = 18
So, Jack has 18 apples."
Response:  Jack has 8 seeds and 10 or more apples. So he has at least 8 + 10 = 18 apples in total. Now, there are 11 apples and 18 seeds in the station. So, from the station, Jack can get at most 11 - 18 = -7 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that Jack gets from the station is negative 7.
Response:  We know that Jack has 3 less apples than Steve and 4 more seeds than Steve. So, if Steve has x seeds and apples, then Jack has x - 3 apples and x + 4 seeds. Now we are given that there are 19 seeds and 15 apples in total in the station. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + (x - 3) = 19... (1) Similarly, we have been told that Jack has 4 more seeds than Steve, so we can write another equation as follows: x + (x - 3) = 15... (2) Now we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many seeds and apples Jack has. Solving both the equations simultaneously, we get: x = 12 Apples: 12 + 3 = 15 Seeds: 12 + 4 = 16 Therefore, Jack has 16 seeds and 15 apples in total.
Response:  Oliva spent $78 in supermarket and he has $103 left after that. So, he gained $25 ($103 - $78).
Response:  Oliva spent $78 in one supermarket. If she had $33 left after shopping, then she must have had $45 initially ( $78 - $33 = $45).
Response:  Oliva invested $100 in Bitcoin and later sold it for $148 per dollar. After that, he bought another Etoro token worth $159 dollars. So, if we calculate the total amount of money he gained after buying both tokens, we get: Total gain = ($148 x 2) + ($159 x 1) = $307 + $159 = $466 Now, let's convert this amount to rupees using today's exchange rate (around Rs. 70-80 per dollar). So, the final answer is: In Rupees = $466 x 70 = Rs. 32,620
Response:  Oliva bought $3 worth of goods from an ATM and then sold them for $49 each. So she earned $49 x 1 = $49 from selling those goods. After that, she spent $49 in a supermarket. Now, we need to find out how much more money she made by spending in the supermarket compared to what she earned from selling the goods. To do this, we can subtract the amount she spent ($49) from the amount she earned ($49): $$ \therefore \text {Amount gained} = \text{Amount earned} - \text{Amount spent} = $49 - $49 = $0 $$ Therefore, Olivia did not make any profit by spending in the supermarket compared to what she earned from selling the goods.
Response:  Oliva bought $53 worth of bonds from Elizabeth and later sold them for $91 each. After that, she invested in a supermarket and made an additional profit of $14 per dollar. So, if we calculate the total amount of money Oliva made from both investments, it would be: Total Profit = ($91 x 2) + ($14 x number of dollars invested in supermarket) Total Profit = $182 + $14x Number of Dollars Invested in Supermarket Total Profit = $196 Now, let's find out how much more Oliva made from the supermarket than what she paid to Elizabeth: Excess Profit = Total Profit - Amount Paid to Elizabeth Excess Profit = $196 - $53 Excess Profit = $143 Therefore, Oliva made $143 more from the supermarket than what she paid to Elizabeth.
Response:  Oliva bought $106 worth of goods in total (including both supermarket and shoes). After he went to the shoe store and spent $49 there, he had $57 left ($106 - $49 = $57). So, Olivia spent $49 at the shoe store.
Response:  Oliva spent $29 after arriving at the supermarket where he initially had $54 in his wallet. So, the amount of money that Olivia spent is: $54 - $29 = $25.
Response:  Oliva spent $38 in a supermarket. If it had started with $128, then after spending $38, how much money does she have left? To find out, we can divide the remaining amount by the initial amount: $$ \frac {128 - 38} {128} = \boxed {0.75} $$ So, Oliva has $75 left after spending $38.
Response:  Dev had 19 apps in his phone and he deleted 5 of them. So, there are 14 apps left in his phone.
Response:  Dev had 7 apps on his phone before he deleted them all on August 18th. After that, he had 5 remaining apps on his phone. So, in total, Dev had 7 + 5 = 12 apps on his phone at some point of time.
"Response:  Dev had 10 apps installed on his phone initially. He added 11 new apps and then removed some of them. After removing some apps, he was left with 4 apps. So, the number of apps that Dev removed is equal to the difference between the initial number of apps (10) and the final number of apps (4). Therefore, the answer is:

$$ \boxed{6} $$"
Response:  Dev had 21 apps installed on his phone initially. He added 89 new apps and then uninstalled some of them. So, the total number of apps he had after uninstalling some is 24 (as given in the question). Now, let's find out how many more apps he installed than he had initially. We can do this by subtracting the initial number of apps from the final number of apps: Number of additional apps = Final number of apps - Initial number of apps = 24 - 21 = 3 Therefore, Dev installed 3 more apps than he had initially.
"Response:  Dev had 15 apps installed on his phone before he added 71 new ones. After deleting some of them, he was left with 14 apps. So, the number of new apps that Dev added is:

New apps = Number of apps after deletion - Number of apps before deletion
= 71 - 15
= 56
Therefore, Dev added 56 new apps to his phone."
"Response:  Dev had 16 apps and 77 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 5 apps and 23 files left. So, the number of apps he deleted is:

Number of apps deleted = Number of apps after deletion - Number of apps before deletion
= 5 - 16
= -11

Therefore, Dev deleted 11 apps."
Response:  We know that Dev had 17 apps and 21 files before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 3 apps and 7 files left. So, we can say that Dev deleted 14 apps (17 - 3) and 14 files (21 - 7). Therefore, the number of apps and files that Dev deleted is 14 each.
"Response:  We know that initially Dev had 15 apps and 24 files in his phone. After deleting some of them, he was left with 21 apps and 4 files. So, the total number of apps that were not deleted is:

21 - 15 = 6

So, out of the initial 15 apps, 6 remained in Dev's phone after deleting some of them."
Response:  We know that Dev had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 6 apps and 15 files left on his phone. So, the total number of apps and files that were left on his phone after deleting some of them is:  Number of apps = 6 (as given in the question) Number of files = 15 (as given in the question) Total number of apps and files left on Dev's phone after deleting some of them = 6 + 15 = 21 Therefore, there are 21 apps and files left on Dev's phone after he deleted some of them.
"Response:  Dev had 17 apps installed on his phone before he added some more. After adding those new ones, he now has 18 apps installed on his phone. So, the answer is:

Dev added 1 app to his phone."
"Response:  Dev had 59 files and 15 apps before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, the number of apps he deleted is:

Number of apps deleted = Number of apps after deletion - Number of apps before deletion
= 12 - 59
= -47

Since we cannot have negative numbers in our answers, let's round off the result to zero (0). Therefore, Dev deleted 0 apps."
Response:  Dev had 24 files and 13 apps on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, the difference between the original number of files (24) and the remaining number of files (21) is 3. Similarly, the difference between the original number of apps (13) and the remaining number of apps (17) is 4. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3 for files and 4 for apps.
Response:  Dev had 24 apps and 9 files before deleting some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 5 files and 12 apps left. So, the number of apps that survived after deletion is 12 - 9 = 3.
"Response:  We know that Dev had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he had 24 files and 2 apps left on his phone. So, the total number of files (including both apps and files) that were left on Dev's phone after deleting some of them is:

Total Number of Files = 24 + 2 = 26

So, there are 26 files in total left on Dev's phone after deleting some of them."
Response:  Neil had 242 cards and gave away 136 of them to Jeff. So, he has 106 cards left with him.
Response:  Neil had 301 cards initially and gave away 25 (25 x $ 1 = $ 25) to Jeff. So, Neil has 301 - 25 = 276 cards left. Now, out of these 276 cards, 154 have been given away to other people, leaving Neil with 276 - 154 = 122 cards. Therefore, the number of cards that Neil had at first was 122.
"Response:  Initially, Nel had 528 cards and Jeph had 11 cards.  After exchanging some of his cards with Jeph, Nel now has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards that Nel gave to Jeph is:

Number of cards given by Nel = Total number of cards left with Nel - Number of cards left with Jeph
= 528 - 11
= 497
Therefore, Nel gave 497 cards to Jeph."
Response:  Initially, Neel had 566 cards and Jeff had 234 cards. When Neel gave some of his cards to Jeff, he had 535 cards left with him. So, the number of cards that Jeff now has is:  Number of cards Neel had initially = 566 Number of cards Neel gave to Jeff =? (From the problem) = 535 - 566 = -31 Number of cards Jeff now has = Total number of cards Neel had - Number of cards Neel gave to Jeff = 566 - (-31) = 535 Therefore, Jeff now has 535 cards.
Response:  Initially, Neel had 309 base ball cards and 356 ten-card packs. He gave some of his cards to Jeff. Now, Neel has 415 base ball cards and 149 ten-card packs left. To find out how many more ten-card packs Neel has than he initially had, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs he gave to Jeff from the initial total: 356 - 309 = 47 So, Neel has 47 more ten-card packs than he initially had. Since each ten-card pack contains 10 cards, Neel now has 47 x 10 = 470 additional cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of base ball cards Neel had initially (309) and the number he has now (415) is equal to the number of additional ten-card packs he has (47). Hence, the answer is 47.
Response:  Initially, Nel had 246 base cards and 214 ten-card packs. After giving some of his cards to Jeff, he has 404 base cards and 495 ten-card packs left. So, the number of base cards that Nel gave to Jeff is: Number of base cards given = Total number of base cards left with Nel - Total number of base cards left with Nel after giving some to Jeff = 404 - 246 = 158 Now, let's find out how many ten-card packs Nel gave to Jeff: Number of ten-card packs given = Total number of ten-card packs left with Nel after giving some to Jeff - Total number of ten-card packs left with Nel = 495 - 214 = 281 Therefore, Nel gave 158 base cards and 281 ten-card packs to Jeff.
"Response: 
Neel had 573 cards initially and gave John 195 cards. Then he took back some of his cards from John (not mentioned how many). Now Neel has 210 cards left with him. So, the number of cards that Neel gave to John is:

Number of cards given to John = Total cards with Neel - Number of cards with Neel after giving some to John
= 573 - 210
= 363
Therefore, Neel gave 363 cards to John."
Response:  We know that Neel had 438 Basball cards and 18 10-card packs initially. He gave some of his cards to Jeff and now has 55 10-card packs and 178 Baseball card packs left. To find out how many more Baseball cards he has than 10-card packs, we can subtract the number of 10-card packs from the total number of Baseball card packs: Number of Baseball cards = Total number of Baseball card packs - Number of 10-card packs = 178 - 18 = 160 Therefore, Neel has 160 more Baseball cards than 10-card packs.
Response:  Initially, Neel had 239 base ball cards and 38 ten-card packs. He gave some of his cards to Jeff. Now, Neel has 376 ten-card packs and 111 basic ball cards left. To find out how many more ten-card packs Neel has than basic ball cards, we can subtract the number of basic ball cards from the total number of ten-card packs: 376 - 111 = 265 So, Neel has 265 more ten-card packs than basic ball cards. Since each ten-card pack contains 10 cards, Neel has 2650 extra cards (265 x 10). Therefore, Neel has 1145 more ten-ball cards than basic ball cards (2650 - 1505).
Response:  We know that Pako had 19 kukis in his stomach and he passed out after eating 35 kukis. So, initially, Pako had 0 kukis in his stomach (since he didn't eat any). Now, let's calculate how many kukis Pako ate in total: Total number of kukis eaten = Number of kukis in Pako's stomach at start + Number of kukis Pako ate = 0 + 19 = 19 + 35 = 54 Therefore, initially, Pako had 0 kukis in his stomach.
"Response:  We know that Pako had 28 kukiz in total and he ate some of them. After eating, he had 7 kukiz left. So, the number of kukiz Pako ate is equal to the difference between the total number of kukiz he had (28) and the number of kukiz he had after eating (7). Therefore, the answer is:

Pako ate 21 kukiz."
Response:  Pako had 40 kukijis initially and he ate two of them. So, now he has 40 - 2 = 38 kukijis left. Then, he sold 17 kukijis to someone else. So, now Pako has 38 - 17 = 21 kukijis left with him. Therefore, the number of kukijis that Pako has after selling some is 21.
Response:  Initially, Paku had 25 cookies and he ate 5 of them. So, now he has 20 cookies left (25 - 5 = 20). Then, he bought 3 more cookies, so now he has 23 cookies in total (20 + 3 = 23). Therefore, the number of cookies that Paku ate is 5.
Response:  The person had 13 cookies initially and ate 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Now, he bought more cookies from those people and gave 36 cookies to them. So, he received 36 + 11 = 47 cookies in total.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies and gave away 5 of them to his friends. So, he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left.
Response:  According to the question, Paku had 17 kukis and he gave 14 of them to his friends. So, he has 3 kukis left with him. Now, he gives 13 of his friends as gifts, which means he has given away 16 (13 x 2) kukis in total. Therefore, the number of kukis Paku has left after giving gifts is 3 - 16 = -13 kukis.
Response:  According to the question, Paku had 12 kukis initially and he gave away 16 of them. So, he has 12 - 16 = -4 kukis left with him. Now, he gave 21 of his friends as many kukis as they wanted. So, each friend got kukis equal to their number. Therefore, the total number of kukis given by Paku to his friends is 21 x Number of friends = 21 x 20 = 420 kukis. Hence, the difference between the number of kukis Paku had initially (12) and the number of kukis he gave to his friends (420) is 420 - 12 = 408 kukis.
Response:  We know that Pako had 22 small cakes and 75 nuts in his bag initially. He gave away 15 small cakes and 54 nuts to someone else. So, now he has fewer items than before. To find out exactly how many less, we need to subtract the number of items he gave away from the initial total.  Therefore, the number of small cakes and nuts that Pako had after giving them away is:  Initially, Pako had 22 small cakes + 75 nuts = 97 items.  After giving away 15 small cakes and 54 nuts, Pako had: 97 - 15 - 54 = 38 items left with him.  So, Pako gave away 69 items (22 small cakes + 54 nuts).
Response:  We know that Pako had 9 sweet and 6 salty kukis. He ate 36 sweets and 3 salty kukis. So, he has 9 + 6 = 15 kukis left. Now, we need to find out how many salty kukis Pako gave away. Since he ate 3 salty kukis, he must have given away 3 - 3 = 0 salty kukis. Therefore, Pako has 15 sweet kukis left.
Response:  We know that initially, Paku had 37 meethi kukis and 11 namakin kukis. After eating 5 meethi kukis and 2 namakin kukis, he had 32 meethi kukis and 9 namakin kukis. Now, we need to find out how many more meethi kukis Paku ate than namakin kukis. To do this, we can subtract the number of namakin kukis from the total number of kukis Paku ate: Number of meethi kukis Paku ate = Total number of kukis Paku ate - Number of namakin kukis Paku ate = 32 - 9 = 23 Therefore, Paku ate 23 more meethi kukis than namakin kukis.
Response:  We know that initially, Paku had 8 sweet and 6 salty snacks. He then ate 20 more sweets and 34 more salty snacks. So, at this point, he has 8 + 20 = 28 sweet snacks and 6 + 34 = 40 salty snacks in total. Now, we need to find out how many more salty snacks Paku ate than sweet snacks. To do this, we can subtract the number of sweet snacks from the number of salty snacks: 40 - 28 = 12. Therefore, Paku ate 12 more salty snacks than sweet snacks.
"Response:  If Pako had eaten 36 kukis in total and he started with 37 kukis initially, then the number of kukis left with Pako would be:

Total kukis eaten = 36
Initial kukis = 37 - 36 = 1

So, there were 1 kuki left with Pako."
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies and gave 14 to his friend. So, he has 22 cookies left (36 - 14 = 22). Then, he gave 10 more cookies to his friend, so now he has 12 cookies left (22 - 10 = 12). Therefore, Paco gave away 12 kukijizz cookies in total.
Response:  Pakko gave his friend 9 kukijizz and he himself ate 18 kukijizz. So, the total number of kukijizz that Pakko had after eating them was 9 + 18 = 27 kukijizz. Therefore, the correct answer is 27.
Response:  Paku gave his friend 30 cookies and ate 23 of them himself. So, he has 7 cookies left (30 - 23 = 7). Now, we need to find out how many more cookies Paku gave to his friend than he ate himself. To do this, we can subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he gave: 7 (cookies given) - 23 (cookies eaten) = 16 (more cookies given). Therefore, Paku gave his friend 16 more cookies than he ate himself.
Response:  We know that Pako had 97 namkeen kukis and 34 meethi kukis initially. He then ate 15 meethi kukis and gave away 56 namkeen kukis. So, the number of meethi kukis left with Pako after giving them away is:  Number of meethi kukis = Initial number of meethi kukis - Number of meethi kukis eaten - Number of meethi kukis given away = 34 - 15 + 56 = 25 Therefore, there are 25 meethi kukis left with Pako after giving them away.
Response:  We know that Pako had 26 namakin kukiz and 17 meethi kukiz. He ate 14 meethi kukiz and 9 namakin kukiz. So, he left behind 9 + 26 = 35 kukiz. Therefore, the answer is 35.
Response:  We know that Paku had 39 small cakes and 6 big cakes of namkeen. He ate 23 small cakes and 32 medium-sized cakes. So, the number of medium-sized cakes he ate is: 23 - 32 = -9. Since negative numbers are not possible in this case, we can conclude that Paku ate more medium-sized cakes than small cakes. Therefore, the difference between the number of medium-sized cakes and small cakes eaten by Paku is : 32 - 23 = 9.
Response:  We know that initially, Paku had 40 mithi kukis and 25 namkin kukis. After eating, he had 28 namkin kukis and 15 mithi kukis left. So, the difference between the number of namkin kukis he had after eating and the initial number is:  28 - 25 = 3  Therefore, Paku ate 3 more namkin kukis than he had initially.
Response:  Gwen spent $7 on her birthday and had $5 left after making some purchases. So she spent a total of $2 = $7 - $5.
Response:  Gwen spent $8 on gifts and has $6 left over after buying them. So, she spent a total of $8 + $6 = $14 on her friend's birthday.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mother and $4 from her father, so she has a total of $6. If she spent $3 on something, then she would have $3 left with her. So, the amount of money that Gwen had after spending $3 was $3.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. If she spent $4, then she received more money from her mother than from her father. So, the difference between the amount of money Gwen received from her mother and her father is $8 - $5 = $3. Therefore, Gwen received $3 more money from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, for a total of $9. If she spent $4, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, Gwen's father gave her more money than her mother.
Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother. If she spent $4 of that amount, then she has $9 left ($5 + $7 - $4). Now, let's compare this amount to what each parent gave her. Her father gave her $5, so she has $9 / $5 = 1.8 times as much money from her father as she does from her mother.
Response:  Gwen gave $5 to her father and received $2 from him. So, she has $7 ($5 + $2) with her. If she spends $6, then she will have $1 left with her ($7 - $6). Now, let's see how much more money she has with her mother compared to her father. Her mother gave her $3, so she has $4 with her mother ($1 + $3). On the other hand, her father gave her $5, so she has $9 with him ($5 + $4). Therefore, Gwen has $9 more with her mother than with her father.
Response:  Josh had 9 bulbs in his collection and he broke some of them. If he now has 4 bulbs left, that means he broke 5 bulbs (9 - 4 = 5). So, Josh broke 5 bulbs.
Response:  Josh had 21 bulbs in his collection and he gave away 12 of them. So, the number of bulbs left with him is 21 - 12 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 bulbs in Josh's collection after he gave some away.
Response:  Josh had 19 balls in his collection initially. He lost 11 of them and gained 5 new ones. So, he has 19 - 11 = 8 remaining balls with him now.
Response:  Josh had 4 birds in his collection and he sold 16 of them, which means he has 16 - 4 = 12 birds left. Then, he bought 8 new birds, so now he has 12 + 8 = 20 birds in his collection. Therefore, Josh sold more birds than he bought, i.e., 16 - 8 = 8 more birds.
Response:  Josh had 7 balls in his collection and lost 3 of them. So he has 4 remaining balls. Now, he found 10 new balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that Josh has now is: 4 + 10 = 14 balls.
Response:  Josh had 21 marbles initially and lost 7 of them. So, he has 21 - 7 = 14 marbles left.
Response:  Josh had 20 marbles initially and gave 2 to Jack. So, he has 18 marbles left (20 - 2 = 18).
Response:  Josh had 22 marbles in his collection initially. Jack gave him 20 bullets. So, now Josh has 22 - 20 = 2 marbles left in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 11 bulbs and gave away 7 of them. So, he has 4 bulbs left (11 - 7 = 4). Now, if there were 19 bulbs in his collection before he gave any away, then after giving away 7 bulbs, he has 12 bulbs left (19 - 7 = 12).
Response:  Josh had 22 balls in his collection initially. He lost 5 balls, so he has 22 - 5 = 17 balls left. Now, he gained 13 balls, so he has 17 + 13 = 30 balls in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 30.
Response:  Josh had 15 bulbs in his collection and he received 9 more bulbs. So, now he has 15 + 9 = 24 bulbs in total. However, 23 bulbs broke, so he lost 23 - 9 = 14 bulbs. Therefore, Josh lost 14 bulbs.
Response:  Josh had 3 bulbuls in his collection and he gave away 5 of them. So, he has 3 - 5 = 2 bulbuls left with him. Now, there are 6 gold coins that he received as gift. Since each bulbul is worth 1 gold coin, Josh has earned 2 x 6 = 12 gold coins from giving away the bulbuls. Therefore, the number of more gold coins Josh got than he gave away is 12 - 5 = 7 gold coins.
Response:  Marko and his father had a total of 4 pounds of sterling silver between them. If Marko alone had 19 pounds of sterling silver, then he must have inherited half of what his father had. So, Marko's share was 2 pounds (half of 4). Therefore, the difference in weight between Marko's inheritance and his father's is 2 pounds - 4 pounds = -2 pounds.
"Response:  Marko and his father had a total of 35 pounds (or 15 kg) of steroids between them. Since Marko had 13 pounds (or 6 kg) of steroids himself, we can calculate how much more or less his father had than him as follows:

Father's weight of steroids = Total weight of steroids - Marko's weight of steroids
= 35 pounds - 13 pounds
= 22 pounds (or 10 kg)
Therefore, Marko's father had 22 pounds (or 10 kg) of steroids more than Marko."
Response:  Marko and his father had a combined weight of 37 pounds (20 + 17). So, Marko's weight was half of that, which is 18 pounds.
Response:  Marko and his father had a total of 106 pounds (Marko - 8 pounds + Father - 32 pounds). So, the weight of Marko's stomach was 8 pounds, and the weight of his father's stomach was 32 pounds. Therefore, the difference in their stomach weights is 24 pounds (32 - 8 = 24).
Response:  Marko and his father had 24 pounds of strawberries between them. Since Marko gave 9 pounds to his father, he now has 15 pounds (24 - 9 = 15). So, Marko's father had 9 pounds of strawberries initially.
Response:  Marko and his father had together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Then, in the return journey, Marko's father gave away 8 pounds of strawberries to someone else. So, now Marko has 12 pounds of strawberries left with him. To find out how much strawberries Marko's father had initially, we can use the information that they had together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marko's father must have had 36 - 8 = 28 pounds of strawberries initially.
Response:  Marko and his father had together made 22 pounds of strobbery icthya. Then, in the reverse direction, Marko's father had taken 30 additional pounds of strobbery icthya. Therefore, the total weight of Marko's strobbery icthya would be 36 pounds. So, the weight of Marko's father's strobbery icthya is 36 - 30 = 6 pounds.
Response:  Marko and his father had to share their strobbery equally. So, if Marko's strobbery weighed 15 pounds, then his father's strobbery would have been half of that, or 7.5 pounds (since he is Marko's father). Therefore, Marko's father's strobbery weighed 37 - 7.5 = 29.5 pounds.
Response:  Marko had a weight of 30 pounds and his father had a weight of 17 pounds. To find out how much more or less Marko's weight was compared to his father's weight, we need to subtract their weights from each other. So, the difference between Marko's weight and his father's weight is: 30 - 17 = 13 pounds. Therefore, Marko's weight was 13 pounds more than his father's weight.
Response:  Marko had a strobbery of 10 pounds and his father had a strobbery of 26 pounds. So, we need to find out how much more or less than Marko's father's strobbery was. We can do this by subtracting Marko's strobbery from his father's strobbery: 26 - 10 = 16 pounds Therefore, Marko's father's strobbery was 16 pounds more than Marko's strobbery.
Response:  Marko and his father had to choose between two options - Stroberi or Pizza. They chose Stroberi. Now, we know that Marko's father's Stroberi cost $11 per pound. If Marko's Stroberi cost $30 per pound, then how much did Marko pay for his Stroberi? Solution: We can set up an equation based on the information given in the question: Let x be the weight of Marko's Stroberi (in pounds) Cost of Marko's Stroberi = Price of Marko's Stroberi x So, if Marko's father's Stroberi cost $11 per pound, then the cost of Marko's Stroberi would be: Cost of Marko's Stroberi = $30 x (weight of Marko's Stroberi / weight of Marko's father's Stroberi) Substituting the values given in the question: Cost of Marko's Stroberi = $30 x (x / 11) Solving for x: x = $30 x / 11 = 27 pounds Therefore, Marko paid $27 for his Stroberi.
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, some more children got into the bus. So, initially, there were 2 + x = 10 children in the bus, where x is the number of additional children who got into the bus. Now, we need to find out how many children are currently in the bus. Therefore, the answer is 2 + x = 10. Simplifying, we get x = 8. So, there are 9 children in the bus now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 26 children in the bus. When the bus stopped, 38 more children got into the bus. So, the total number of children in the bus now is: 26 + 38 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus now.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 children in the bus (as mentioned in the question). When the bus stopped at the next stop, 2 more children got on the bus, making it a total of 5 children. Then, when the bus stopped again after traveling for another 2 km, an additional 39 children got on the bus, taking the total number of children to 41. So, the answer is: 5 + 39 = 44.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 43 children in the bus. Now, some of them got off the bus and went to another bus (which is called ""bus stop""). So, the number of children left in the original bus = total initial children - number of children who went to other bus.  Therefore, the number of children who went to other bus = 21 (as given in the question).  Now, we need to find out how many children boarded the second bus from the first one. To do this, we will divide the number of children who went to other bus by the number of children remaining in the first bus.  Thus, the number of children who boarded the second bus from the first one = Number of children who went to other bus / Number of children remaining in the first bus = 21 / 20 = 1.05."
"Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off from the bus and went to another bus (which is called ""bus stop""). After that, there were 18 children left in the original bus. So, initially, there were 23 more children than now in the bus (i.e., 41 - 18 = 23)."
Response:  We know that initially there were 21 children in the bus. Of these, 10 got off at the stop and 5 more entered the bus while it was moving. So, now there are 16 children in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus while it was moving is 5.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 children in the bus and then 63 more children got into the same bus. So, the total number of children in the bus after they all boarded was 68 (5 + 63). Now, some of these children left the bus, leaving 14 behind. Therefore, the number of children who remained in the bus after they all boarded is 14 - 6 = 8.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and then 68 more children boarded the same bus while some of them left it. So, the total number of children in the bus now is: 36 + (68 - x) = 12 Where 'x' represents the number of children who left the bus. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  We know that initially there were 22 children in the bus and then 40 more children boarded the same bus while some of them got off. So, the total number of children in the bus at one point was 62 (22 + 40). Now, we are told that some of them got off the bus, leaving only 2 children inside the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children left inside the bus, which is 2. Hence, the number of children who boarded the bus but did not get off is 60 (40 - 2).
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus. Then, 8 more children got into the same bus, making it a total of 36 children (including the initial 28). Finally, some of these children left the bus, leaving behind 30 children altogether. So, the number of additional children who got into the bus and then left is 8 - (-3) = 11.
Response:  We know that initially there were 23 children in the bus and then 4 more children got off the bus, leaving it with 20 children. So, the total number of children who got off the bus is 4. Now, we need to find out how many children got off the bus after those 4 children left. To do this, we will subtract the number of children who got off earlier (4) from the initial number of children (23). Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus after those 4 children left is 19.
"Response:  If Becker has made 133 keys and he sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining keys with him. Now, if he sells these 82 keys to someone else at a profit of Rs. 50 per key, then he will make a total profit of:

 Profit = Number of keys sold x Profit per key
= 82 keys x Rs. 50 per key
= Rs. 4100 (approximately)
So, Becker made an additional Rs. 4100 by selling the remaining 82 keys after selling 51 keys."
Response:  The beker had 54 coins and he sold some of them. If there are still 13 coins left with him, then he must have sold 41 coins (54 - 13 = 41).
Response:  The beker made 145 keys and then gave them away. So, initially, he had 72 keys with him (since he gave away 73 keys). Now, if he has still 72 keys, it means he must have made 72 + 145 = 217 keys in total. Therefore, the beker made 217 keys.
Response:  The bekar had 155 keys and gave 140 to his friend. So, he has 15 - (140 - 15) = 15 - 125 = -109 keys left with him. Therefore, the number of keys that are left with the bekar is -109.
Response:  The beker had 121 keys initially and sold 105 of them. So, he has 16 (121 - 105) keys left with him now.
"Response:  The beker had 13 coins and sold 91 of them at Rs. 2 each. So, the total amount earned from selling these coins is:

91 x Rs. 2 = Rs. 182

Now, the beker also bought 154 new coins at Rs. 3 each. Therefore, the total cost incurred for buying these coins is:

154 x Rs. 3 = Rs. 462

So, the profit earned by the beker after buying and selling the coins is:

Rs. 182 - Rs. 462 = Rs. (-) 280

Therefore, the beker lost Rs. 280."
Response:  The beker had 170 coins and sold 78 of them. So, he has 92 coins left (170 - 78 = 92). Now, he bought 31 new coins. Therefore, the total number of coins he has is 92 + 31 = 123 coins.
"Response: 
The beker made 110 keys and sold 75 of them. So, he has 35 keys left with him (110 - 75 = 35).  Then, he made another 26 keys and sold all of them. Therefore, the number of keys the beker has now is 35 + 26 = 61 keys."
"Response: 
The beker made 144 keys and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 keys and sold them all. So, in total, the beker has sold 71 + 111 = 182 keys. Therefore, the number of keys left with the beker is 144 - 182 = 62 keys."
"Response:  The beker had 149 coins and 91 paisas earlier. If he sells 10 coins and 90 paisas, then his remaining amount of coins will be:

Coins = 149 - 10 = 139

And his remaining amount of paisas will be:

Paisas = 91 - 90 = 1

So, the beker now has 139 coins and 1 paisa in his possession."
Response:  The beker had 7 keek and sold 15 keek, so he has 7 - 15 = -8 keek left.  He also had 148 pestries and sold 15, so he has 148 - 15 = 133 pestries left.
Response:  If Becker has made 126 keys and 48 pastries, then he has a total of 174 items (126 + 48).  If he sells 115 keys and 81 pastries, then he will have 93 fewer items than before (174 - 93 = 81). So, Becker has sold 81 more keys than pastries.
Response:  If Becker had sold 70 kilograms of cocaine and 88 packets of heroin, he would have made $ 19 x $ 250 = $ 4,750 from cocaine and $ 88 x $ 100 = $ 8,800 from heroin. So in total,Becker has earned $ 4,750 + $ 8,800 = $ 13,550.
Response:  If Becker has 157 keys and sells 158 keys, then he will have 1 key less than before. So, his new stock of keys is 156.  Similarly, if he sells 147 pastries, he will have 20 fewer pastries in his stock (since he already had 169). Therefore, his new stock of pastries is 147 - 20 = 127.
Response:  If Becker has 54 keys and makes 143 pastries, then he has 143 - 54 = 99 extra keys to sell.  If he sells 68 keys, then he will have 99 - 68 = 31 extra keys left to sell.
Response:  If Becker had sold 44 keys before he made 48 keys, then he has 48 - 44 = 14 more keys now. So, Becker has 14 keys in his possession currently.
Response:  If Becker had started with 40 coins and then sold 8 coins, he would have earned Rs. 8 x 2 = Rs. 16. So, now he has 40 - 8 = 32 coins left. Now, if he sells these remaining 32 coins at the same price of Rs. 2 per coin, he will earn Rs. 32 x 2 = Rs. 64. Therefore, the total amount that Becker earned is Rs. 64 + Rs. 16 = Rs. 80.
Response:  The friend of Becker bought 137 kg of sugar from him at an earlier price of Rs 169 per kilogram. If Becker had sold those 137 kg of sugar at his current price of Rs 137 per kilogram, how much money would he have made? So, the profit earned by Becker = Selling price - Purchasing price = Rs 137 x 137 = Rs 18,059. Therefore, Becker now has Rs 18,059 more than what he had earlier.
"Response:  The beker had 173 coins initially and sold 86 of them. So, the number of coins left with the beker is:

Initial coins = 173
Sold coins = 86

Now, let's subtract the number of coins sold from the initial number of coins:

Number of coins left with the beker = Initial coins - Sold coins
= 173 - 86
= 87

So, there are 87 coins left with the beker."
Response:  The bekar made 99 keys and sold 167 new keys. So, he earned $99 x 167 = $16,533 from selling new keys. Now, he bought 89 keys and sold them for $89 x 89 = $7,721. Therefore, the difference between the number of keys he bought and sold is: $16,533 - $7,721 = $8,812.
Response:  The beker had 8 coins initially and bought 139 new coins. So, the total number of coins with the beker is: 8 + 139 = 147 coins. Now, the beker sold 145 coins. Therefore, the number of coins left with the beker is: 147 - 145 = 2 coins.
"Response: 
The beker made 62 keys and then made another 149 keys. Out of these, he sold 144 keys. So, the number of keys left with the beker is:

Number of keys made = 62 + 149 = 211

Out of which, he sold = 144

So, the number of keys left with the beker = 211 - 144 = 67

Therefore, there are 67 keys left with the beker."
"Response: 
Becker had 81 keys and then made 92 more keys. He sold 46 of them. So, he has 92 - 46 = 46 additional keys that he did not have earlier."
"Response:  The bekar has already made 61 paisas and 167 keys. If he sells 108 keys and 44 paisas, then his remaining amount of money will be:

Total amount of money with the bekar = 61 + 167 = 228

Amount sold by the bekar = 108 + 44 = 152

Remaining amount of money with the bekar = Total amount of money - Amount sold = 228 - 152 = 76

Therefore, the bekar still has 76 keys and 76 paisas left in his possession."
Response:  The bekar had initially 56 paisas and made 124 keys. If he sold 104 keys and kept 29 for himself, then the number of paisas he has now is:  Number of paisas = Initial amount + Amount earned from selling keys - Amount kept for self = 56 + (104 x Rs 1) - 29 = 56 + 104 - 29 = 87 paisas So, the bekar currently has 87 paisas.
Response:  If Becker has made 52 pesticides and 84 keys, then he has sold 102 keys and 94 pieces of pesticide. So if he had more pesticine than key, he would have made that many extra keys. Therefore, the number of extra keys Becker made is 102 - 84 = 18.
Response:  If Becker has made 134 posts and 11 keys, then he has 134 + 11 = 145 items to sell.  If he sells these at Rs 140 each, then his total revenue will be 145 x 140 = Rs 19,600. So, Becker has earned an additional amount of Rs 19,600 by selling more posts than he had initially.
Response:  If Becker has 14 keys and makes 153 pastries, then he has 153 - 14 = 149 keys left after making those pastries.  Now, if he sells 8 pastries and 97 keys, then he has 149 - 8 = 141 keys left. So, Becker sold 141 - 97 = 44 more keys than he had initially.
Response:  If Becker has 43 keys and makes 114 pastries, then he has 43 + 114 = 157 keys in total.  If he sells 154 pastries and keeps 78 for himself, then he sold 154 - 78 = 76 pastries. So, Becker made $76 x 20 = $1520 from selling pastries.
Response:  We know that there are 22 games in Kelai's collection and he has given away 140 toys. So, we need to find out how many games Kelai has left after giving away 140 toys. To do this, we can divide the total number of games (22) by the number of toys he gave away (140): Number of games left = Total number of games / Number of toys given away = 22 / 140 = 0.16 or 16% Therefore, Kelai has 16% of his original game collection left, which is 3 games.
"Response:  If there are 106 games and she takes away 64 of them, then the number of remaining games is:

106 - 64 = 42

So, there will be 42 games left after she takes away 64 games."
Response:  If Keli had given 91 games in total and still has 92 games left, then at some point in time, he must have started with more than 91 games. So, the number of games Keli started with can be calculated as follows: Number of games Keli started with = Total number of games given - Number of games already played (i.e., 91) = 92 - 91 = 1 Therefore, Keli started with 1 game.
Response:  We have 20 non-stop games and 70 sonic games in total. To play 12 non-stop games without stopping, Kelvin needs to play at least 3 non-stop games per day (since he has 12 days). So, we need to divide the total number of non-stop games by the number of days he has:  Number of non-stop games per day = Total number of non-stop games / Number of days = 20 / 12 = 1.67 Non-stop games per day Now, let's calculate how many sonic games Kelvin can play each day: Number of sonic games per day = Total number of sonic games / Number of days = 70 / 12 = 5.83 Sonic games per day Since Kelvin cannot play more than 12 non-stop games per day, he will have to choose which ones to prioritize. He can either play all 12 non-stop games or some combination of non-stop and sonic games that adds up to 12 games per day. For example, if he chooses to play 4 non-stop games and 4 sonic games per day, he will still be able to complete all 20 non-stop games within his 12-day time frame.
Response:  We have 46 non-tendy games and 132 sonny games. To get 31 sonny games, we need to give away some of our non-tendy games. So, we can give away 13 non-tendy games (since we have 46 - 13 = 33 non-tendy games left). Now, we have 33 non-tendy games and 132 sonny games. To get 31 sonny games, we need to give away some more non-tendy games. But since we already gave away 13 non-tendy games, we only have 20 non-tendy games left (since 33 - 13 = 20). Therefore, we will have 31 sonny games if we give away 7 non-tendy games (since 20 + 7 = 31).
Response:  We have 80 games in total and we need to reduce them to 31 or less. To do this, we will divide the total number of games by 31, which gives us $2.57$ ( rounded to nearest integer). So, we need at least $26$ games to leave $6$ games behind. Therefore, the required number is $26$.
Response:  We know that Randi has 52 blocks and he wants to use them to build a tower of height 10 blocks. If 38 blocks are left after building the tower, then how many blocks did Randi have initially?  To find out, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the question: Number of blocks Randi had = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower  Number of blocks Randi had = 52 - (10 x 38)  Number of blocks Randi had = 52 - 380  Number of blocks Randi had = -328  So, Randi had negative 328 blocks initially.
Response:  We know that Randi has 97 blocks and he wants to use some of them to build a tower. If 72 blocks are left after building the tower, then we can say that Randi used 25 blocks (97 - 72 = 25) for building the tower.
"Response:  We know that Randi has 79 blocks and he wants to use them to build a tower or a house.  To do this, he needs to divide the blocks into groups of 14 for building the tower and 11 for building the house. So, we can say that:
Number of blocks used for building the tower = 79 / 14 = 5
Number of blocks used for building the house = 79 / 11 = 7
Therefore, there are 5 blocks left over after building both the tower and the house."
Response:  Randhi has 58 blocks to build a tower and a house. To build a tower, he uses 27 blocks, leaving him with 31 blocks. To build a house, he uses all of the remaining 31 blocks, which is equal to 53 blocks. Therefore, Randhi used a total of 53 + 27 = 80 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randi has 37 blocks and wants to build a tower. He uses 33 blocks for that purpose and 13 blocks for building a house. So, he used a total of 46 blocks (33 + 13) to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Randhi has 86 blocks and wants to use them to build either a tower or a house. He uses 79 blocks to build the tower and 82 blocks to build the house. So, he used a total of 151 blocks (79 + 82).
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are left after using 36 blocks for making one tower. So, we will subtract 36 from 59.  59 - 36 = 23 Therefore, 23 blocks are left.
Response:  For building a house, Randi needs 20 blocks to build the walls and roof of the house. So, he has used 20 + 50 = 70 blocks in total for building the house.
Response:  Randhi has 90 blocks and wants to build a house with 89 blocks and a tower with 63 blocks. To find out how many blocks he used for each structure, we need to subtract the number of blocks required for the other structure from the total number of blocks available.  For the house, he needs 89 blocks, so he can use 90 - 89 = 1 block extra for some other purpose or as a reserve. Similarly, for the tower, he needs 63 blocks, so he can use 90 - 63 = 27 blocks extra for some other purpose or as a reserve. Therefore, Randhi used 27 + 1 = 28 blocks for both structures combined.
Response:  We know that there are 20 different books in the library and we have not read any of them yet. So, if we have not read any book, then we have read zero books. Therefore, the number of books we have read is 0.
Response:  We know that Vahan has read 13 books and hasn't read 8 books yet. So, the total number of books he hasn't read is 8 - 13 = -5 books. Since we are asked how many books there are in the school library, we need to subtract the number of books Vahan hasn't read from the total number of books in the library. Therefore, the number of books in the school library is: Total number of books in the library - Number of books not read by Vahan = Total number of books in the library - (-5) = 20 books.
Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 movies in total. If you have read 12 books and watched 56 movies, then you still have to read 9 more books (22 - 12 = 10). And for movies, if you have watched 56, then you still have to watch 44 more movies (10 x 4 = 40). So, the number of books left to read is 9, and the number of movies left to watch is 44.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 different books and 17 different movies. If we have read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then we have seen a total of:

Books = 4 x 19 = 76
Movies = 17 x 7 = 120
Therefore, if you want to watch more movies, you will need to watch at least 120 more movies."
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in 'Pagal MooRakshas School'. If we have read 19 books and watched 13 films, then the number of more books than films is:

Number of more books = Number of books read - Number of films watched + 1 (Since we have already watched 13 films)
= 19 - 13 + 1
= 5
Therefore, there are 5 more books than films in 'Pagal MooRakshas School'."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in 'Pagal MooRakshas School'. If we have read 19 books and watched 61 films, then the number of films more than books is:

Films More Than Books = Number of Films Watched - Number of Books Read
= 61 - 19
= 42
Therefore, there are 42 more films than books in 'Pagal MooRakshas School'."
Response:  We know that there are 10 different books and 11 different movies mentioned in the passage. If we have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, then we have read more books than movies. So, the difference between the number of books read and movies watched is 1 (book). Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that there are 11 different books and 17 different movies. If we have read 7 books and watched 21 movies, then we have read more than half of the total number of books (i.e., 11). So, the number of books we have read is greater than or equal to 11/2 = 5-6 books. Similarly, if we have watched more than half of the total number of movies (i.e., 21), then we have watched greater than or equal to 21/4 = 5-6 movies. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies we have watched and the number of books we have read is 5-6 - (-3) = 8-9 movies.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the school library and we have read all of them. So, if there were 14 different books in the school library, we would not be able to read all of them yet since we have already read 8. Therefore, the number of books left to read is 14 - 8 = 6.
Response:  We know that there are 62 different movies and 19 different books. If you have watched 34 movies and read 4 books, then you still have to watch 28 more movies (62 - 34 = 28) and read 15 more books (19 - 4 = 15). Therefore, you still need to watch and read more.
Response:  We know that there are 8 different movies and 21 different books in the school library. If we read 7 books and watch 4 movies, then we have already watched/read 7 + 4 = 11 items from the total collection. So, we still have 8 - 11 = 7 movies or books left to watch/read.
"Response:  We know that there are 14 different movies and 15 different books in the ""Pagal Muraaksh School"" library. If we read 11 books and watch 40 movies, then the number of movies more than books is:

Number of movies = 40 - 11 = 29

So, there are 29 more movies than books in the ""Pagal Muraaksh School"" library."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 different films and 11 different books in 'Pagal MooRK School'. If we read 13 books and watch 63 films, then the number of films more than books is:

Films = Books + (Books x Number of Films watched)
= 11 + (13 x 63)
= 11 + 790
= 801
Therefore, there are 801 more films than books in 'Pagal MooRK School'."
"Response:  We know that the person has watched 14 movies and read 19 books.  To find out how many more books they have read than movies, we need to subtract the number of movies from the total number of books. So, the difference between the number of books and movies is:

19 - 14 = 5

Therefore, the person has read 5 more books than movies."
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies mentioned in the passage. If Aapne 19 films have watched and read 16 books, then we can calculate the number of movies they have watched as follows: Number of movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies already seen = 5 - 5 = 0 So, Apne has not watched any additional movie beyond what is mentioned in the passage.
Response:  Dev had 7 tickets in total and he sold some of them for Rs. x. If there are still 2 tickets left with him, then the number of tickets he sold = Total tickets - Number of tickets left with him = 7 - 2 = 5. So, Dev sold 5 tickets for Rs. x.
Response:  Dev has already won 12 tickets out of 15. So, he still has 3 tickets left with him. If he wins another ticket in the next round, then he will have 4 tickets left with him (12 + 1 = 4). Therefore, Dev has won 4 tickets in total in the game so far.
Response:  Dev has won 18 tickets in total. If he buys some of them with 5 people and wants to keep 11 more for himself, then how many tickets will he have left after buying 5 tickets?  We know that Dev has 13 tickets left after buying 5 tickets. So, if he buys 11 more tickets, he will have 2 (13 - 5 = 2) tickets left. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Dev has won 19 tickets in total. If he used some of those tickets to buy clothes and other things worth Rs. 7, then he must have used at least 7 tickets for that purpose. So, the number of tickets left with him after buying clothes and other things is 19 - 7 = 12 tickets.
Response:  Dev has won 13 tickets in Arcadia Deck. If he wants to buy some clothes and needs 8 tickets for that, then he will have 5 (13 - 8) tickets left over after buying clothes. Similarly, if he wants to buy some more tickets and needs 18 tickets for that, then he will have 7 (5 - 18) tickets left over after buying both clothes and tickets. Therefore, Dev has bought 7 + 5 = 12 tickets in total.
Response:  Dev won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets in total. So he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he sold these tickets at Rs 10 each, then he would have earned Rs 12 x 10 = Rs 120.
Response:  We know that Helly had planted 14 trees in his garden and one of them died after 9 days. So, there are 13 surviving trees. Now, we need to find out how many more trees would have died if all the remaining trees had died at the same rate as the tree that died after 9 days. To do this, we will divide the total number of days (27 days) by the time taken for the first tree to die (9 days). This gives us an average death rate per day = 3 trees/day. Therefore, the number of trees that died in the remaining 20 days is = 20 x 3 = 60 trees. So, in total, 60 + 13 = 73 trees died in the garden.
Response:  We know that Halli had planted 13 trees in his field and one of them died after 6 days. So, out of 13 trees, 1 tree died. Now, we need to find out how many trees survived. To do this, we will divide the total number of trees (13) by the number of days passed (7). Therefore, 13 / 7 = 2. Therefore, 2 trees survived.
Response:  Initially, Halli had 20 piles of wheat. After the storm, he reduced it to 16 piles (4 piles were lost). So, in total, 4 piles of wheat got destroyed due to the storm.
"Response:  We know that Helly planted some trees in her garden and one of them died after 5 years. If there were initially 12 trees, then the number of surviving trees is:

Surviving trees = Initial number of trees - Number of dead trees
= 12 - 1
= 11

Therefore, out of 12 trees, 11 survived."
Response:  Helly had planted 9 peppers in his garden and one of them died after 4 days. Then he planted 5 more peppers. So, the total number of peppers that are left is:  Number of peppers initially = 9 Pepper that died = 1 New peppers planted = 5 Total number of peppers left = Initial peppers - Dead peppers + New peppers planted = 9 - 1 + 5 = 7
Response:  After the storm, 2 trees fell and died. If he had planted 12 trees earlier, then out of those 12 trees, 10 trees are still alive (since 2 trees have fallen). So, there are 10 surviving trees.
Response:  If there were initially 3 peds in the heli and 13 ped died after the toffee, then the total number of peds that survived is 3 - 13 = -10. So, the number of peds that died is 10.
Response:  If there were initially 11 peds and 2 ped died after a toffee, then the remaining 9 peds are left. Now, if we assume that each ped has an equal chance of dying due to the toffee, then the probability of any one ped dying is (1/11) = 0.090909... (approximately). Since two peds have already died, the total number of peds that survived is 9 - 2 = 7. Therefore, the ratio of peds that survived to those that died can be expressed as 7 : 2 or 3.5.
"Response:  If they cut 66 bores in a day and each bore has 28 Santars (rows of wheat), then the number of Santars cut per day is:

66 bores / 28 Santars per bore = 2.43 Santars per day"
"Response:  We know that Santra has to cut 24 branches in total.  If he cuts 8 branches per day, then it will take him:

24 branches / 8 branches per day = 3 days

So, Santra will need 3 days to cut all 24 branches."
Response:  The farmer said that he saw the wheat crop for 4 days and calculated that each day it cut 12 bundles of wheat. If they cut a total of 56 bundles of wheat in 4 days, then how many bundles will they cut in one day? We can calculate this as follows: Number of bundles cut per day = Total number of bundles cut / Number of days taken to cut them = 56 bundles / 4 days = 14 bundles per day.
Response:  We know that Santosh cuts 38 branches per day and each branch has 42 seeds. So, in total, he plants 1560 seeds (38 x 42) every day. Now, we need to find out how many bags of seeds he will have after 49 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of seeds planted daily by the number of days passed: 1560 seeds/day x 49 days = 73,300 seeds Total bags of seeds = 73,300 seeds / 50 seeds/bag = 1466 bags
Response:  The Saint man cuts 66 bamboos per day and each bamboo has 25 shoots. So, in total, he cuts 1660 shoots (66 x 25) every day. Now, if he continues this work for 87 days, then the total number of shoots he will have is: Total shoots = Number of days x Total shoots per day = 87 x 1660 = 143200 shoots.
Response:  We know that Santosh cuts 8 branches every day and each branch has 35 leaves. So, he cuts 8 x 35 = 280 leaves per day.
Response:  We know that Santra is equal to 16 and he cuts it every day. So, in one week (i.e., 7 days), he will have cut 16 x 7 = 112 Santras. Now, we need to find out how many days it takes for him to cut 80 Santras. To do this, we can divide the total number of Santras he needs to cut by the number of Santras he cuts per day: 80 / 16 = 5 days. Therefore, it will take Santra 5 days to cut 80 Santras.
Response:  If they cut 67 branches in total and each branch has 12 santars, then the number of santars cut = Total branches x Number of santars per branch = 67 x 12 = 804 santars. Therefore, if they cut 35 branches, the number of santars cut = Total branches x Number of santars per branch = 35 x 12 = 420 santars.
Response:  The man cuts 74 branches every day and removes 71 of them. After 51 days, how many bags of santr are there in his possession? We can use the information given in the question to find this out. So, after 51 days, he has removed 3621 branches (71 x 51). Since each branch produces 2 bags of santr, he now has 3621/2 = 1810.5 bags of santr. Therefore, there are 1810.5 bags of santr in his possession after 51 days.
Response:  If he sees 76 bores per day and cuts off 64 of them, then he cuts off 64/76 = 0.83 bores per day. Since there are 50 santars in each bore, he cuts off 0.83 x 50 = 41.5 santars per day.
Response:  We know that in total, Santu had 70 bores of wheat and he ploughed for 26 days. So, the number of bores he would have after 26 days is: Total bores = Number of bores per day x Number of days = 70 / 26 = 2.77 bores per day Now, we need to find out how many bores Santu would have at the end of 26 days if he had 28 bores of wheat initially. So, let's calculate it: Initial bores = Total bores / Number of days = 2.77 bores/day x 26 days = 71.2 bores Therefore, after 26 days, Santu would have 71 bores of wheat.
Response:  The farmer has 82 bores of wheat and harvests 61 bores in 25 days. So, after 25 days, he will have 82 - 61 = 21 bores of wheat left.
Response:  We know that Santosh takes out 31 borers from the ground every day and leaves 24 untouched. Therefore, in total, he has taken out 31 x 45 = 1365 borers from the ground during this period. Now, we need to find out how many untouched borers are left after 45 days. So, the number of untouched borers = Total borers - Number of borers taken out = 24 x 45 = 1040 borers.
Response:  We know that Santu has cut 44 full baskets and 25 half baskets per day. So, in total, he has cut 44 + 25 = 69 baskets per day. Now, we need to find out how many incomplete baskets (i.e., half baskets) Santu cuts every day. Since there are 25 half baskets per day, Santu cuts 25 / 2 = 12.5 incomplete baskets every day. Therefore, the number of complete baskets Santu cuts every day is 69 - 12.5 = 56.5 baskets per day.
Response:  We know that in one day, Santu cut 5 more branches of trees than he planted. So, if he plants x branches per day, then he will cut (5 + x) branches per day. Since he cuts 74 more branches than he plants, we can write an equation as follows:  x - 74 = (5 + x) Now, to find out how many more branches are cut than planted, we need to solve for x. Solving the above equation, we get: x = 106 Therefore, Santu cuts 106 more branches than he plants per day.
Response:  If they cut 54 branches in total and they cut 18 branches per day, then it will take them __________ days to cut all the branches.
Response:  We know that Santra had cut 56 branches in total and he did it for 14 days straight. So, how many branches did he cut per day on average? To find out, we can divide the total number of branches (56) by the number of days (14): 56 / 14 = 3.85714285714286 Therefore, Santra cut approximately 3.85 branches per day on average during those 14 days.
Response:  The farmer plants 25 seeds per day and harvests 5 seeds per day. So in total, he has harvested 105 seeds (25 x 4 = 100 + 5). Therefore, after 73 days, he will have 73 x 100 = 7300 seeds.
Response:  On day 1, they cut 65 borer santare and 46 bore pake santare. So after 6 days of cutting, they will have cut a total of: 65 x 6 = 390 borer santare + 46 x 6 = 276 bore pake santare = Total = 666 borer santare + 276 bore pake santare = 942 santare.
Response:  We know that in one day, Santu cuts 41 impure sandals and 86 pure sandals. So, the number of pure sandals he cuts per day is 86/2 = 43. Therefore, Santu cuts 43 pure sandals per day.
Response:  We know that there are 71 more unripe mangoes than ripe ones per day. So, the number of unripe mangoes per day is 71. Now, we also know that each ripe mango is equivalent to 2/3 of an unripe mango in terms of weight. Therefore, the total weight of unripe mangoes per day can be calculated as follows: Total weight of unripe mangoes = Number of unripe mangoes x Weight of one unripe mango = 71 x 0.6 = 42.6 pounds (or 19 kg) Since there are 60 more unripe mangoes than ripe ones per day, the total weight of all mangoes per day can be calculated as follows: Total weight of all mangoes per day = Weight of ripe mangoes + Weight of unripe mangoes = 42.6 + 42.6 = 85.2 pounds (or 38.7 kg) Therefore, there are 13.6 pounds (or 6.2 kg) more unripe mangoes than ripe mangoes per day.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how long it is from one wall to the other, we need to multiply the height by the width: length = height x width = 12 x 11 = 132 feet Now, since the room is rectangular in shape, half of the length will be equal to twice the width: half-length = 2 x width = 2 x 11 = 22 feet So, the length of Jessie's room is 132 - 22 = 110 feet
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is given as 7 feet. If we want to make it 14 feet tall, then we need to add 7 feet to its current height. So, the new height of Jessie's room will be: 7 + 7 = 14 feet. Therefore, the increase in height is 7 feet.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is given as 7 feet. To find out how many times it can fit in a 14-foot wide hallway, we divide the height of the room by the width of the hallway: 7 ft / 14 ft = 0.5 (or half) So, Jessie's room can fit exactly half into a 14-foot wide hallway.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 11 feet and its length is 15 feet. If there was a wall that was 16 feet tall before Jessie moved in, then after she moved in, how much space would be left for her to furnish? We need to subtract the height of the existing wall from the total height of the room. So, the available space for furnishing = Total height of the room - Height of the existing wall = 15 ft x 7 ft (since the width of the room is also 7 feet) = 105 square feet Now, we know that Jessie wants to fill up the entire room with furniture, so the amount of space required to do so = Total area of the room = 105 square feet + 16 square feet (for the existing wall) = 121 square feet Therefore, Jessie needs approximately 121 square feet of space to furnish her entire room.
Response:  The height of the room is 2 feet and the length is 12 feet. If each tile size is 4 feet long, then we need to calculate how many tiles are required to cover the entire floor area. To do this, we can divide the total area of the floor (length x width) by the area covered by one tile. So, the number of tiles needed = Total Area / Area per Tile = 12 x 6 = 72 tiles. Therefore, you will need 72 tiles to cover the entire floor area of the room.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 19 feet and its width is 18 feet. If it has 20 rooms, then the total area of all the rooms will be: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 square feet Now, we need to calculate how much space each room needs for furniture and other things. Let's assume that Jessie wants at least 5 feet (60 inches) of free space around each piece of furniture for easy movement and comfort. So, the minimum required space per room = 5 feet x Number of Rooms = 5 x 20 = 100 square feet Therefore, the total amount of space needed for all 20 rooms = Total Area - Minimum Required Space = 342 - 100 = 242 square feet Hence, Jessie needs at least 242 square feet of unobstructed space in her room for all 20 rooms.
Response:  The height of Jessie's room is 19 feet and its length is 20 feet. To find out how long Jessie's bedroom is, we need to multiply the height and length. So, the length of Jessie's bedroom = Height x Length = 19 x 20 = 380 square feet. Therefore, Jessie's bedroom is 380 square feet long.
"Response:  If Jessie wants to cover his room with a 10-foot long curtain and his room is 5 feet wide, then we need to find out how many times the curtain will wrap around the room.  We can do this by dividing the length of the curtain (10 feet) by the width of the room (5 feet):

Number of wraps = Length of curtain / Width of room = 10 ft / 5 ft = 2 wraps
So, Jessie needs two wraps of the curtain to cover his 5-foot wide room that is 10 feet long."
Response:  If Jessie wants to cover his room with a 10-foot long curtain and his room is 2 feet high, then we need to find out how many times the curtain will wrap around the room. We can do this by dividing the length of the curtain (10 feet) by the height of the room (2 feet): Number of wraps = Length of curtain / Height of room = 10 ft / 2 ft = 5 wraps So, the curtain will wrap around the room 5 times.
Response:  The total area of Jessie's room is given as 18 square feet. If we assume that the room has a rectangular shape with dimensions of length x and width y (where x > y), then we can find the area of the room using the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = length x width = xy square feet. Since the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, we have: Area = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. So, the area of Jessie's room is 80 square feet. Now, let's calculate how much space Jessie needs to move all her furniture around in the room. We know that the room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so the perimeter of the room is: Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(4 + 20) = 64 feet. Therefore, Jessie needs at least 64 feet of unobstructed space to move all her furniture around in the room.
Response:  The revenue of each t-shirt is $ 23 dollars and they sold 150 t-shirts in total. So, their total revenue would be: Total Revenue = Number of T-Shirts x Selling Price = 150 x $ 23 = $ 3450.
Response:  The shop sold 3 T-shirts at $51 each during the time when Arkansas and Texas played their match. So, we have: Total revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 3 x $51 = $153 Total cost =? To find out the total cost, we need to know how much it costs for the shop to produce one T-shirt. We can assume that the cost remains constant regardless of the number of T-shirts produced. Therefore, the total cost of producing 3 T-shirts is: Total cost = Cost per T-shirt x Number of T-shirts = $10 x 3 = $30 So, the profit made by the shop is: Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $153 - $30 = $123
Response:  The refrigerator store sells each T-shirt for $ 87 dollars. If they played Arkansas and Texas games during that time and sold 95 T-shirts in total, then their total earnings from selling T-shirts would be: Total earnings = Number of T-shirts sold x Price per T-shirt Total earnings = 95 x $ 87 Total earnings = $ 8275 So if they had sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, their earnings from selling T-shirts would be: Earning from selling T-shirts = Total earnings / Number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game Earning from selling T-shirts = $ 8275 / 47 Earning from selling T-shirts = $ 176.38
Response:  The refrigerator store sells each T-shirt for $ 106. During the Arkansas game and Texas Tech game, they sold a total of 242 T-shirts. If they had sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, how many did they sell during the Texas Tech game?
Response:  The refrigerator store sells each T-shirt for $98. During Arkansas and Texas games, they sold a total of 163 T-shirts. If they had sold 89 T-shirts during Arkansas game, how much money did they make from selling T-shirts during that game alone?  We can calculate this by dividing the number of T-shirts sold during Arkansas game by the price per T-shirt and multiplying it by the total amount earned from selling T-shirts during both games. So, the calculation is: Number of T-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 89 Total amount earned from selling T-shirts during both games = 163 Price per T-shirt = $98 Therefore, the amount made from selling T-shirts during Arkansas game alone = ($98 x 89) = $85,710
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold = Total number of t-shirts available x Percentage of t-shirts sold in Arkansas + Percentage of t-shirts sold in Texas  = 186 t-shirts x (78 dollars/t-shirt) + 104 t-shirts x ($56 dollars/t-shirt)  = 1392 dollars + 536 dollars  = 1928 dollars So, if they had sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and 104 t-shirts during the Texas game, they would have made a total of 1928 dollars.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $ 62 and that of each jeans is $ 99. If they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 jeans during the period of Arkansas and Texas games, then their total revenue from these sales would be: Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost price of T-shirt + Number of jeans x Cost price of jeans = 183 x $ 62 + 31 x $ 99 = $ 10,753 + $ 2,993 = $ 13,746 Total revenue = $ 13,746
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold = Total number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 74 t-shirts x $67 = $4892  Similarly, the total number of jeans sold = Total number of jeans x Price per jeans = 156 jeans x $165 = $25,300  So, the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts and jeans is: Total amount of money made = Total revenue from t-shirts + Total revenue from jeans = $4892 + $25,300 = $30,192
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $ 192 and that of one jeans is $ 34. So, if they sell 157 T-shirts and 19 jeans, their total revenue will be: Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost of T-shirt + Number of jeans x Cost of jeans = 157 x $ 192 + 19 x $ 34 = $ 28,606 + $ 653 = $ 29,259 Now, we need to find out how much more money they made selling T-shirts than jeans. To do this, we can subtract the revenue from the cost of jeans: Excess revenue from jeans = Revenue - Cost = $ 29,259 - $ 653 = $ 28,606 This means that for every T-shirt sold, they made $ 28,606 / $ 34 = 84 dollars more than selling a jeans.
Response:  The cost of one T-shirt is $ 86 dollars and that of one jeans is $ 232 dollars.  If they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jeans during Arkansas and Texas games, then we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost per T-shirt + Number of Jeans x Cost per Jeans Total Revenue = 254 x $ 86 + 43 x $ 232 Total Revenue = $ 210,720 + $ 9,920 Total Revenue = $ 219,640 Now, to find out how much each T-shirt costs in comparison to a jeans, we need to divide the total revenue from selling T-shirts by the number of T-shirts sold: Cost of one T-shirt / Number of T-shirts sold = Total Revenue from T-shirts / Number of T-shirts sold Cost of one T-shirt / 254 T-shirts sold = $ 86 / 254 = $ 3.35 So, it takes approximately $ 3.35 to make one T-shirt compared to one jeans which costs around $ 232.
Response:  The total number of t-shirts sold = Total number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt = 130 t-shirts x $ 51 dollar/t-shirt = $6,300  So, they made $6,300 selling 130 t-shirts.
Response:  The cost price of each T-shirt is $ 20, and they sell it for $ 25. So, their profit per T-shirt = Selling Price - Cost Price = $ 25 - $ 20 = $ 5. Now, they sold 14 T-shirts, so their total profit = Number of T-shirts x Profit per T-shirt = 14 x $ 5 = $ 70.
Response:  Arkansas and Texas are playing a cricket match during which Reshma runs a T-shirt shop selling T-shirts for $ 60 each. If she makes $ 10 profit from each T-shirt, then how many T-shirts did she sell?  To find out, we need to divide the total amount of money made ($ 60 x number of T-shirts sold) by the profit per T-shirt ($ 10). So, if Reshma sold X T-shirts, then: $$ \frac {60x} {10} =? $$ Simplifying the equation, we get: $$ 60x = 600 $$ Now, dividing both sides by $ 60 (since there are 60 dollars in every T-shirt), we get: $$ x = 10 $$ Therefore, Reshma sold 10 T-shirts during the cricket match.
Response:  The total amount of money earned is $215. Since there were 5 t-shirts sold, we can calculate the revenue per t-shirt as follows: Revenue = Total Amount Earned / Number of Items Sold Revenue = $215 / 5 Revenue = $43 per t-shirt Therefore, each t-shirt cost $43.
Response:  The shopkeeper sells each T-shirt for $215 and each jeans for $50. So, if they sold 20 T-shirts and 64 jeans during Arkansas and Texas games, their total revenue would be: Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + Number of jeans x Price per jeans Total revenue = 20 x $215 + 64 x $50 Total revenue = $4,370 + $3,240 Total revenue = $7,610 Now, let's calculate the profit made by the shopkeeper: Profit = Total revenue - Cost Total cost = Number of T-shirts x Cost price per T-shirt + Number of jeans x Cost price per jeans Total cost = 20 x $100 + 64 x $30 Total cost = $2,000 + $1,920 Total cost = $3,920 Profit = Total revenue - Total cost Profit = $7,610 - $3,920 Profit = $3,690 Therefore, the shopkeeper made a profit of $3,690 from selling 20 T-shirts and 64 jeans during the Arkansas and Texas games.
Response:  The cost price of each Reebok shirt is $204 and that of each Jersey is $76. If they sold 158 T-shirts and 2 Jerseys during Arkansas and Texas games, then their total revenue from these sales would be: Total revenue = Number of T-shirts x Cost price per T-shirt + Number of Jerseys x Cost price per Jersey Total revenue = 158 x $204 + 2 x $76 Total revenue = $31,960 Now, let's find out how much profit they made by selling these items: Profit = Total revenue - Cost of goods sold (COGS) Profit = $31,960 - ($204 x 158 + $76 x 2) Profit = $31,960 - $3,676 Profit = $28,284 So, they made a profit of $28,284 by selling T-shirts and Jerseys during Arkansas and Texas games.
Response:  The cost of one Reebok duffle bag is $210 and that of each T-shirt is $240. During Arkansas and Texas games, they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 jerseys. So, we need to find out how much more does one T-shirt cost than one jersey.  We can do this by dividing the cost of one T-shirt ($240) by the cost of one jersey ($210).  Therefore, one T-shirt costs $30 more than one jersey.
Response:  The cost of one Reebok duffle bag is $115 and that of each T-shirt is $25. During Arkansas and Texas games, they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 jerseys. To find out how much one T-shirt costs in comparison to one jersey, we need to divide the cost of one jersey by the number of jerseys sold. So,  $25 (cost of one T-shirt) / 78 (number of jerseys sold) = $0.32 per jersey. Therefore, one T-shirt costs $0.32 less than one jersey.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables with each set containing 10 cups, then the total number of cups they have is: 5 x 10 = 50 cups. So, there are 50 more cups than what they had initially.
Response:  We know that there are total 12 kursiyas in the party and each table has 4 sets of kursiyas. So, the number of kursiyas in one set is 12/4 = 3. Therefore, the number of kursiyas in each mej (table) is 3.
Response:  We know that there are 9 cups in total and we have to find out how many sets of three cups each are available in the table. So, let's count the number of sets of three cups:  Total number of cups = 9 Cups per set = 3 Since there are 9 cups in total, the number of sets of three cups is: Number of sets = Total number of cups / Cups per set = 9 / 3 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 sets of three cups in the table.
Response:  We know that there are 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 cups. So, in total, there are 11 x 13 = 143 cups in all the tables combined.
"Response:  There are 10 sets of cards and each set has 6 cards. If 11 people sit around the table, then each person will get one card from each set. So, in total, there will be 10 x 6 = 60 cards remaining after everyone gets their share. Therefore, 60 - 11 = 49 cards will remain unused or ""khali"" as you mentioned in the question."
"Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 cups. So, the total number of cups is:

12 x 14 = 168

Now, we have to find out how many additional cups there are. The question states that there are 6 additional cups. Therefore, the total number of cups for the men is:

168 + 6 = 174

So, there are 174 cups available for the men."
Response:  There are 14 people attending the party and each set of tables has 3 cups. So, total number of cups = 14 x 3 = 42 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 14 cups in each table and they have 9 sets of tables. So, we need to find out how many cups are there in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of tables with the number of cups in each table: Number of cups = Total number of tables x Number of cups per table  Number of tables = 9 x 14 = 126 cups Therefore, there are 126 cups in total.
Response:  If Luius makes $460 in total in 5 weeks, then he must make an average of $92 per week. So, if we divide this amount by 7 days (as there are 7 days in a week), we get: $92 / 7 = $13 per day. Therefore, Luius makes approximately $13 per day.
Response:  If Luiz makes $1216 in total during his working hours of 40 hours/week for 5 weeks, then he will make: Total earnings = Number of working hours x Hourly wage = 40 hrs/wk x $16/hr = $640 per week Now, if he works for 5 weeks, then the total amount earned is: Total earnings = $640/week x 5 weeks = $3200 So, Luiz can work for approximately 7 weeks ( $3200 / $16/hr = 200 hours) to reach his target of $1216.
"Response: 

The farmer earns $21 per day from his crops for 216 days in a year. Therefore, he earns total income of $4532 ($21 x 216) per year.  If he invests $702 in some other business or asset, then his net profit will be $3830 ($4532 - $702)."
Response:  If Luiz makes $1357 per month and works for 223 days in a year, his total income would be: Total Income = Monthly Income x Number of Days Worked in a Year = $1357 x 223 = $$304,610$$ Now, if he works for 73 months (which is equal to 6 years), his total income over that period would be: Total Income Over 6 Years = Total Income x Number of Years Worked = $$304,610 x 6 = $1,829,660$$ Therefore, Luiz will make approximately $1,829,660 over 6 years.
"Response: 

The farmer earns $28 per day and works for 7 days in a week, so he earns $28 x 7 = $196 per week.

Now, if he works for 4 weeks in a month (as mentioned in the question), then his total income in a month would be $196 x 4 = $784 per month.

Similarly, if he works for 1091 days in a year (as mentioned in the question), then his total income in a year would be $784 x 1091 = $859,360 per year."
"Response:  Louisa makes $403 per month working for 233 weeks in a year. If she earns $49 extra every day, her total income for the year will be:

Total Income = Monthly Income x Number of Weeks in a Year
= $403 x 233
= $93,530

So, if Louisa earns $49 extra every day, she will make approximately $93,530 in a year."
Response:  If Lewis makes $368 per week and he works for 1359 weeks (which is equal to 20 years), then his total income would be: Total Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = $368 x 1359 = $479,640 Now, if he invests $388 every week in a fruitful business venture that yields an annual return of 10%, then after 20 years, his investment would grow to: Investment Growth = Annual Return x Number of Years = 10% x 20 = $38,800 So, after 20 years, Lewis's total income from both his work and investments would be: Total Income After 20 Years = Total Income + Investment Growth = $479,640 + $38,800 = $518,440
Response:  Louis has earned $1181 in 1181 days (or 3 years). If he had earned $216 every day instead of $491, his total earnings would be: Total Earning = Number of Days x Daily Earnings = 1181 x 216 = $257,066 Now, if we subtract the amount he spent on fruits and vegetables ($491 x 1181 = $575,911), he will have $257,066 left over after buying groceries for 1181 days or 3 years.
Response:  If Luiz makes $133 per month, and he works for 19 weeks (or 76 days), then his daily income can be calculated as follows: Daily Income = Monthly Income / Number of Days Worked = $133 / 76 = $1.75 per day Now, to find out how much money Luiz makes in a week, we multiply his daily income by 7: Weekly Income = Daily Income x Number of Days in a Week = $1.75 x 7 = $12.75 per week Therefore, Luiz makes $12.75 per week.
Response:  Louis makes $2 per hour and works for 8 hours a day. So his daily income is $16 ($2/hour x 8 hours). Now, if he works for 7 days a week, his total weekly income is $112 ($16 x 7 days). If he works for 4 weeks straight, his total monthly income is $448 ($112 x 4 weeks). Finally, if he works for 5 months straight, his total yearly income is $2,190 ($448 x 5 months). Therefore, he can make up to $2,190 in one year.
Response:  After taking a break (आराम), they made a decision to climb again (तैरने). If the depth of the water in the well is 10 feet more than the height of Din (DD), and Din is 9 feet tall, then how deep is the water in the well?  We know that the depth of the water in the well is equal to the height of Din plus the additional 10 feet. So, we can write an equation as follows: Water Depth = Din + 10 feet Now, we need to find out the value of Din. From the given information, we know that Din is 9 feet tall. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the above equation: Water Depth = 9 + 10 feet = 19 feet So, the water in the well is 19 feet deep.
Response:  We know that after taking rest (आराम), they made a decision to go upward (तैरने). The depth of water is 2 guna deeper than Denver (डीन) which means it is 2 guna deeper than 8 feet (8 फीट). If Ron is 14 feet tall (रॉन 14 फीट पर खड़ा है), then how deep was the water? Water is 2 guna deeper than Denver, so if Denver is 8 feet deep, then the water is 10 feet deep (पानी कितना गहरा था). Therefore, the answer is 10 feet.
Response:  After taking a break of 5 minutes, Ron decided to climb again. Denver is 11 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron is standing at 12 feet tall and water is 5 times deeper than him, then how deep is the water? We know that the depth of the water is equal to 5 times the height of Ron plus the height of Denver. So, we can write an equation as follows: Water Depth = 5 x (Ron Height) + (Denver Height) Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Water Depth = 5 x (12) + (11) Water Depth = 60 + 11 = 71 feet Deep Water = 71 feet
Response:  We know that after taking rest (आराम), they made a decision to go upward (तैरने). The depth of water is given as 15 feet more than the height of Den (गहराई डीन). So, if Den is 4 feet long, then its height will be 4 + 15 = 19 feet. Now, we are asked how much deeper the water is compared to Ron (पानी) which is 13 feet tall. Therefore, the difference in depth between Water and Ron is 19 - 13 = 6 feet.
"Response:  We know that after taking rest (आराम), Ron decided to climb Mount Everest again. The height of Mount Everest is 8848 meters or 29029 feet. If Ron reached the summit at an altitude of 13 feet above sea level, then the depth of water in the lake would be:

Depth = Height of Mount Everest - Altitude of Ron
= 8848 m - 13 ft
= 8735 m

So, the depth of water in the lake is approximately 8735 meters or 28656 feet."
"Response:  We know that after taking a bath, Ron measured the depth of water in the bathtub to be 9 feet (gaharā) and Den measured it to be 6 feet (kam). So, we can calculate the difference between their measurements as follows:

Difference = 9 - 6 = 3 feet (gaharā)

Now, let's convert this value from gaharā to feet:

3 feet x 0.3048 (conversion factor) = 0.912 feet

So, the water was 0.912 feet deeper than Ron's measurement."
"Response:  Brain has 34 books in his possession and he wants to distribute them equally among 2 boxes. Since each box can hold at most 2 books, we need to find out how many books will fit into each box.  Therefore, the number of books that will fit into each box is:
Number of books per box = Total number of books / Number of boxes
= 34 / 2
= 17
So, there are 17 books in each box."
Response:  Brain has 42 books in his library and each book contains 2 shelves. So, total number of shelves = 42 x 2 = 84 shelves. Now, each shelf can hold 20 books, so total number of books = 84 x 20 = 1680 books. Therefore, Brain has 1680 books in his library.
"Response:  If Brain has 23 books and each book contains an average of 27 pages, then the total number of pages in all his books is:

23 x 27 = 641 pages

Now, if Brain also has 80 magazines, then the total number of pages he has is:

641 + 80 = 721 pages

Therefore, Brain has a total of 721 pages worth of reading material."
Response:  Brain has 9 books and 46 newspapers. If we want to find out how many newspapers are there in each of his 10 books, we need to divide the total number of newspapers (46) by the number of books he has (10). So, the number of newspapers in each book is : 46 / 10 = 4.6 newspapers per book.
Response:  Brain has 23 books and 61 newspapers. Each book contains an average of 20 pages, and each newspaper contains an average of 4 pages. So, in total, Brain has: Books = 23 x 20 = 460 pages Newspapers = 61 x 4 = 244 pages Now, we need to find out how many books and newspapers Brain actually has. To do this, we will divide the total number of pages by the average number of pages per book or newspaper. For books, we have: Total pages / Average pages per book = 460 / 20 = 23 books For newspapers, we have: Total pages / Average pages per newspaper = 244 / 4 = 61 newspapers Therefore, Brain has 23 books and 61 newspapers.
"Response:  Brain has 7 books in each of his shelves, and he has 3 shelves. So, the total number of books Brain has is:

7 x 3 = 21 books

Now, if Brain had a total of 28 books, then the number of books in each shelf would be:

28 / 3 = 9 books per shelf

So, there are 9 books in each of Brain's shelves."
Response:  Brain has $ 38 in his accounts and each book costs $ 2. So if he has total of 38 books then how many books does he have? We can calculate it as follows : Number of Books = Total amount / Cost per Book = 38 / 2 = 19 So Brain has 19 books in his account.
Response:  Carol wants to give gifts to 10 friends on their birthdays. Each gift pack contains 2 gifts. So, in total, Carol needs 2 x 10 = 20 gift packs. Therefore, she needs 20 gift packs so that no friend goes outside.
Response:  We are given that there are 12 friends and each friend has received 3 packages. So, in total, 12 x 3 = 36 packages have been distributed among the friends. Now, we need to find out how many nimontran (gifts) are present in each package. Since the number of gifts in each package is equal for all packages, let's assume that there are 'x' nimontran in each package. Therefore, the total number of nimontran in all the packages is 36 x x.
"Response:  Carol sent 10 invitations to her friends and bought 7 packets of them. If she only sends 2 friends an invitation, then the number of invitations that will remain unsold is:

Number of invitations remaining unsold = Number of invitations sent - Number of packets purchased
= 10 - 7
= 3
Therefore, 3 invitations will remain unsold if Carol sends only 2 friends an invitation."
Response:  Carol gave instructions to her friends for their birthdays and each instruction contained 14 questions. She bought 6 packets of those instructions and then she bought additional 11 packets. So, in total, she can inform about 780 (6 x 14) + 11 = 891 friends' birthdays.
Response:  Carol wants to give gifts to her 9 friends on their birthdays. Each gift has 3 wishes inside it, and she buys 2 packets of these gifts. To find out how many additional wishes Carol will have if she buys 9 packets, we need to calculate as follows: Number of wishes in each packet = 3 Number of packets bought by Carol = 2 Total number of wishes Carol has = Number of packets x Number of wishes per packet = 2 x 3 = 6 Additional wishes Carol will have if she buys 9 packets = Total number of wishes - Initial number of wishes = 6 - 6 = 0 So, Carol will not have any additional wishes if she buys 9 packets.
Response:  Melisa scored 12 points in each of the 3 games she played. So, she scored a total of 36 points. Therefore, she played 3 games.
Response:  Melisa played 3 matches and scored a total of 81 points. Since each match has equal number of points, let's assume that she scored x points in each match. Therefore, we can write an equation:  Total score = Number of matches x Points per match So, we have: 81 = 3x Now, divide both sides by 3 to get x: x = 27 So, Melisa scored 27 points in each match.
Response:  Melisa scored 109 points in each game. If she also got 82 bonus points in every game, then the total score for each game would be:  Total Score = 109 + 82 = 191 points per game. Now, let's find out how many matches Melisa played. According to the question, she played 79 matches. So, the total number of points she scored is: Total Points = Number of Matches x Total Score per Match = 79 x 191 = 14639 points.
Response:  Melisa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points in each of the games. Therefore, the number of games played by Melisa is:   Number of games = Total points / Points per game = 21 / 7 = 3
Response:  Melisa has scored 91 runs in 13 matches, and each match has only one score. So, she must have scored 91/13 = 7 numbers of scores.
Response:  We know that there are 4 seats in the Swarg Park and 20 people can visit it at the same time. So, we need to find out how many people can sit on each seat. To do this, we will divide the total number of visitors (20) by the number of seats (4). Therefore, each seat can accommodate 5 people (20/4 = 5).
Response:  If there are 18 people who want to enter the park at the same time and each seat can accommodate 9 people, then we need to find out how many seats are available in total.  We know that there are 18 people who want to enter the park, so we divide them by 9 to get the number of seats available: 18 ÷ 9 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 seats available in the ferry for all those who want to enter the park at the same time.
"Response:  We know that there are 19 seats in each ferry and one ferry can accommodate 15 people at a time. So, to find out how many people can travel in all 20 ferries simultaneously, we need to divide 19 (the number of seats in each ferry) by 15 (the maximum capacity of each ferry). Therefore, the answer is: 

$$ \frac{19}{15} = 1.33 $$

So, approximately 133 people can travel in all 20 ferries simultaneously."
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in the ferry and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the total capacity of the ferry is:

18 seats x 15 people/seat = 270 people

Now, if 10 seats get destroyed in one go, the number of people who can take the ferry at that time will be:

270 people - 10 seats = 260 people

Therefore, at any given time, 260 people can take the ferry."
Response:  We know that there are 6 seats in the Swarg Park and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, if 16 people have already occupied the park, then we need to find out how many additional people can be accommodated in the remaining 6 seats. To do this, we divide the total number of people (16) by the capacity of each seat (14): 16 / 14 = 2 Therefore, an additional 2 people can be accommodated in the remaining 6 seats.
Response:  We know that there are total 2 small seats and 23 big seats in Swarg Park.  Now, we need to find out how many people can sit on each of these seats.  For small seats, each seat can accommodate 14 people, so the total number of people who can sit on small seats is 14 x 2 = 28 people.  Similarly, for big seats, each seat can accommodate 54 people, so the total number of people who can sit on big seats is 54 x 23 = 1206 people.  Therefore, the total number of people who can sit in Swarg Park is 28 + 1206 = 1234 people.
Response:  We have three small seats and seven big seats in Swarg Park. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, while each big seat can accommodate 12 people. Now, we need to find out how many people can sit on the big seats. To do this, we divide the total number of people who can sit on all the seats (i.e., 3 + 7 = 10) by the number of big seats (i.e., 7). So, the answer is 10/7 = 1.43 or approximately 15 people. Therefore, 15 people can sit on the big seats in Swarg Park.
Response:  If there are 16 people in Svarga Park and they can ferry each other at the same time, then the number of trips required to transport all 16 people across the river is given by: Number of trips = 16 / 4 = 4 trips Since there are 4 trips, each trip can accommodate 4 people. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can be seated in one boat (or seat) is 4.
Response:  We know that there are four people who can ferry passengers in one time slot. So, each person can carry two passengers at a time. Therefore, the total number of seats available for passengers in the Ferry Whell is 8 (4 people x 2 passengers per person).
Response:  We have given an order for 7 pizzas and each pizza has equal sized pieces (or toppings). So, if there are total 14 pieces in all 7 pizzas, then each pizza will have how many pieces?  To find out, we can divide the total number of pieces by the number of pizzas: Total Number of Pieces = 14 Pieces per Pizza = 14 / 7 = 2 pieces per pizza Therefore, each pizza will have 2 pieces.
Response:  We have given some instructions to each pizza. Each pizza has 2 slices. If we had a total of 28 slices, then we would have ordered how many pizzas?  So, the answer is 28 / 2 = 14 pizzas.
Response:  We have 17 orders and each order has 4 slips. So, we have total number of slips = 17 x 4 = 68 slips. If there are 25 in total, then the number of complete sets (or tukteds) is 25 / 4 = 6 complete sets or tukteds. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We have 9 orders with each order containing 10 pieces of pizza. So, in total, we have 9 x 10 = 90 pieces of pizza. If we divide this number equally among two people, then each person will get 90/2 = 45 pieces of pizza.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted one seed in each flower pot containing 45 flowers, then they would have planted a total of 45 x 10 = 450 seeds. Therefore, the number of seeds planted is 450.
"Response:  We know that there are 9 flowers and each flower has 45 seeds in its pot. So, the total number of seeds in all the pots is:

9 x 45 = 365

So, if they plant one seed in each pot, then they will plant:

365 seeds / 9 flowers = 40 seeds per flower"
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 36 seeds in total and each flower bed had 12 seeds. So, the number of flower beds is 36 / 12 = 3.  Now, we know that only 58 flowers bloomed in all the flower beds. Therefore, the number of unused seeds is 36 - 58 = 20.  Hence, there were 20 seeds left unused.
Response:  We know that Paige planted 55 seeds in total and each flower bed had 15 seeds. So, the number of flower beds is 55/15 = 3.73 (approximately). Since they could only grow 60 flowers in each bed, the total number of flowers grown is 60 x 3.73 = 224.8 (approximately). Therefore, the answer is approximately 225 flowers grew.
Response:  If Paige's mother was helping her plant 10 seeds in each pot and they had a total of 60 seeds to plant, then: Number of pots = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds per pot = 60 / 10 = 6 pots So, there were 6 pots filled with flowers.
Response:  If Paige's mother had planted 8 flowers in total and each flower had received 4 seeds, then the number of seeds planted would be 8 x 4 = 32 seeds. So, if they were to equally distribute these 32 seeds among all 8 flowers, each flower would receive 4 seeds / 8 flowers = 5 seeds per flower.
Response:  If Mathieu gave each of his 11 friends 2 patties each, then he had given a total of 2 x 11 = 22 patties. So, Mathieu had 22 patties in total.
Response:  If Mathieu had 8 friends and he gave each friend 2 patakhe, then he gave a total of 8 x 2 = 16 patakhe to his friends.
Response:  If Mathieu had 15 patthes and distributed them equally among his 5 friends, each friend would get 3 patthes (15/5 = 3).  Since 10 patthes are still left after distribution, each of Mathieu's remaining 4 friends got 2 patthes (10/4 = 2). So, in total, all 5 friends together consumed 9 patthes (3 + 2 x 4 = 9).
Response:  If Mathyu had 24 patties and distributed them equally among his 3 friends, each friend would get 8 patties (24/3 = 8).  Since 17 patties are left after distribution, it means that Mathyu gave 8 - 17 = -9 patties to his friends. So, Mathyu did not give any patties to his friends.
"Response:  If Mathyu has 22 patties and wants to distribute them equally among his 11 friends, then each friend will get:

Number of patties = Total number of patties / Number of friends
= 22 / 11
= 2

So, each friend will get 2 patties."
Response:  Mathhew had 29 pats of meat and divided them equally among his two friends. So each friend got 14.5 pat of meat (29/2). Now, each friend also got 30 keys. So altogether, each friend got 44.5 things (14.5 + 30).
"Response:  Mathhew has 14 patties and 21 keks. If he distributes them equally among his 7 friends, then each friend will get:

Patties: 14/7 = 2 patties per friend
Keks: 21/7 = 3 keks per friend
So, each of Mathhew's 7 friends will get 2 patties and 3 keks in total."
Response:  If Maithyu had 18 friends and gave each of them an equal number of sweets, then he distributed a total of 18 x 36 = 640 sweets. So, each friend got 640 / 18 = 35 sweets.
Response:  If Maithyu gave each of his friends 6 patashees, and he had 36 friends in total, then the number of patashees he gave away is:  Number of friends = 36 Patashees given per friend = 6 So, the total number of patashees given away by Maithyu is: Total number of patashees given away = Number of friends x Patashees given per friend = 36 x 6 = 216
Response:  Maithili had 23 patties initially and distributed them equally among her two friends, resulting in each friend getting 11 patties. So, if Maithili gave one patty to each of her two friends, then she would have 23 - (2 x 11) = 23 - 22 = 1 patty left. Therefore, each of Maithili's two friends got 11 patties.
Response:  If Mathyu had 31 pots and gave equal shares to his 5 friends, then each friend would get 6 (31 / 5) pots. So, Mathyu gave 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 30 pots to his friends. Therefore, there are 30 - 5 = 25 pots left with Mathyu.
"Response:  Maithili has given each of her 4 friends an equal number of patties and keks. So, if she had 32 patties and 98 keks to start with, then each friend got:

Patties: 32 / 4 = 8 patties per friend
Keks: 98 / 4 = 24 keks per friend
Now, let's assume that each person ate x patties and y keks. We know that the total number of patties eaten is 8x + 24y, and the total number of keks eaten is 24x + 8y.
We are also told that the sum of these two quantities is equal to 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

8x + 24y = 100... (1)
24x + 8y = 100... (2)
Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 25
y = 75
So, each person ate 25 patties and 75 keks in total."
Response:  Maithili has given 4 friends an equal number of patthas and kekes. So each friend got 25 patthas ( since there are 4 friends ) and 6 kekes ( since there are 4 friends). Now, if Maithili had 10 patthas and 8 kekes at the start, then she would have distributed them equally among her 4 friends, so each friend received 2.5 patthas and 1.5 kekes. Therefore, each friend ate 3 kekes in total.
Response:  Maithili has distributed 28 friends equally among 4 categories - Pattharka and Kek. If there were initially 13 Pattharks and 15 Kecks, then each person would have eaten:  For Pattharks: Number of Pattharks = Total number of friends / Number of categories = 28 / 4 = 7 Pattharks per category. Therefore, each person would have eaten 7 Pattharks.  For Kecks: Number of Kecks = Total number of friends / Number of categories = 28 / 4 = 7 Kecks per category. Therefore, each person would have eaten 7 Kecks.
Response:  Debi bought some water bottles when they were on sale for Rs 5 each. If she buys 109 bottles in one day, then she spent Rs 545 (109 x 5) that day. Now, if the bottles lasted for 74 days, then Debi had to buy 74 x 2 = 148 bottles more during those 74 days. So, in total, Debi bought 109 + 148 = 257 bottles.
Response:  Debi bought 153 bottles of water and drank one every day for 17 days. So, she drank a total of 153 x 17 = 2491 bottles of water in those 17 days.
Response:  Debi bought 264 bottles of water and sold them in 11 days. So, she sold an average of 23.7 bottles per day (264 / 11 = 23.7). Now, if she had kept 15 bottles every day for 11 days, then she would have kept a total of 195 bottles (15 x 11 = 195). Therefore, Debi has left with 79 bottles less than what she initially had (264 - 195 = 79).
Response:  Debi bought 301 bottles of water at Rs. 2 each and sold them for Rs. 1 each. If she had some profit in mind, then she would have sold them for more than Rs. 1 each. So, let's assume that she sold each bottle for Re. 1.50. Now, if she had 144 bottles left after selling 301 bottles, then she must have sold those 144 bottles in 30 days (as there are 30 days in a month). Therefore, she made a profit of Re. 0.50 per bottle (Re. 1.50 - Re. 1) per day. Since she had 157 bottles left after selling 301 bottles, she must have sold those 157 bottles in 23 days (as there are 23 days in 157 / 6 = 23). So, her total profit is: Profit = Number of bottles sold x Profit per bottle x Number of days taken to sell those bottles = 157 x Re. 0.50 x 23 = Re. 34.50
Response:  Debi bought 88 pots of water and 13 pots of milk. If she buys them at a rate of 4 pots of water per day and 87 pots of milk per day, then how many days will it take for her to finish all these pots?  We know that Debi has 88 pots of water, which means she can buy 88/4 = 21 pots of water in one day. Similarly, since she buys 13 pots of milk per day, she can finish 13/87 = 0.15 pots of milk in one day. So, it will take Debi 21 + 0.15 = 21.15 days to finish all the pots of water and milk. Therefore, the answer is 21.15 days.
"Response:  Debi bought 200 pots of water and 256 sooda pots in total. If she buys 312 pots of water and 4 sooda pots per day, then the number of sooda pots she will buy in one day is:
So, the number of days it will take for her to buy all the sooda pots = Number of sooda pots she buys per day x Total number of sooda pots she wants to buy / Number of days she buys them
= 4 x 256 / 312
= 4 x 256 / 312
= 19 days
Therefore, Debi will buy 19 days worth of sooda pots."
Response:  Debi drinks 6 bottles of water per day. If she buys 12 bottles of water in total, then she will have to buy them over how many days?  We can calculate this as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of bottles per day x Total number of days = 6 x 30 (days) = 180 bottles So, Debi will be able to use those 180 bottles for 30 days. Therefore, she will run out of water after 30 days.
"Response:  Debi bought 95 bottles of water and 180 bottles of milk. If she consumed 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of milk in one day, then the number of days it will take for her to consume all the bottles is calculated as follows:

Number of bottles of water = Total bottles of water / Number of days taken to consume them
= 95 / x
where x is the number of days taken to consume 95 bottles of water.

Similarly, we can calculate the number of days taken to consume all the bottles of milk:

Number of bottles of milk = Total bottles of milk / Number of days taken to consume them
= 180 / y
where y is the number of days taken to consume 180 bottles of milk.

Now, we have two equations:

x + y = 15 (as Debi consumed 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of milk in one day)
y = 180 / x (as Debi had 180 bottles of milk and consumed x bottles in one day)

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 73 days (Debi took 73 days to consume 95 bottles of water)
y = 23 days (Debi took 23 days to consume 180 bottles of milk)

Therefore, Debi will take 73 days to consume 95 bottles of water and 23 days to consume 180 bottles of milk."
Response:  Debi bought 360 bottles of water and 162 bottles of juice when they were in the market. If she buys 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of juice per day, then how many days will it take for her to finish all the bottles?  We know that Debi has 360 + 162 = 522 bottles in total. Since she buys 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of juice per day, she will finish all the water bottles in 42 days (360 / 122 = 42). As for the juice bottles, since she buys 9 bottles per day, she will finish them in 60 days (162 / 9 = 70). So, in total, Debi will finish all the bottles in 42 + 70 = 112 days.
Response:  We know that Feynman had 14 pens in total and each pen has 11 parts. So, we can calculate the total number of parts as follows: Total Number of Pens = 14 Parts per Pen x Number of Pens = 14 x 11 = 154 parts. Therefore, there are 154 parts in total.
Response:  We know that there are 12 pens in total and we have to divide them equally among 3 boxes. So, each box will contain 4 pens (12/3 = 4). Now, let's find out how many pens are in each pen. Since there are 4 pens in each box, and we have 3 boxes, then the total number of pens is 4 x 3 = 12 pens. Therefore, the answer is 12 pens.
Response:  We know that Feey had 16 pens in her pencil case and each pencil case contained 28 packs of pens. So, we can calculate the total number of pens as follows: Number of pens = Total number of pencil cases x Number of packs per pencil case x Number of pens per pack Therefore, the total number of pens Feey could have made is: Number of pens = 16 x 28 x 24 = 35,792 pens
Response:  We know that Feey has 22 pens in total and she wants to divide them equally among 6 packs of 14 pens each. So, we can start by dividing 22 by 6: 22 / 6 = 3.67  Since you cannot have a fraction of a pen, we will round up to the nearest whole number: 3 × 6 = 18 Therefore, Feey has 18 pens in each pack.
"Response:  We know that Feena had 35 pens and 7 pents.  Each pen can make 5 pents, so we have:

35 pens x 5 pents/pen = 175 pents

So, Feena could make 175 pots of pens if she had 35 pens and 7 pents."
"Response:  We know that Feey had 19 pens and pencils in total.  Each pen has 4 pens inside it, so we have:

19 x 4 = 76 pens

Now, each pencil has 27 leads inside it, so we have:

19 x 27 = 503 leads

Therefore, there are 76 pens and 503 leads in total with Feey."
Response:  We know that Feynman has 36 pens and 30 pencils in total. Now, we need to find out how many pencils are there in each of the 7 boxes. So, let's assume that he has x pencils in each box. Then, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of boxes x Number of pencils in each box 30 pencils = x ( since he has 30 pencils in total) Now, we have two equations: 1. 36 pens + x pencils = 7 boxes 2. 30 pencils = x Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to get the value of x. Substituting equation 2 into equation 1, we get: 36 pens + x pencils = 7 boxes 30 pencils = x 36 pens + x - 30 pencils = 7 boxes Solving for x, we get: x = 4 pencils per box Therefore, Feynman has 4 pencils in each of the 7 boxes.
Response:  We know that Feey had 11 pencils and 11 pens in total.  Each pencil has 31 leads and each pen has 27 nibs. So, we can calculate the total number of leads as follows: Total leads = Number of pencils x Leads per pencil = 11 x 31 = 341 leads Now, let's calculate the total number of nibs: Total nibs = Number of pens x Nibs per pen = 11 x 27 = 307 nibs Therefore, Feey has 341 leads and 307 nibs in total.
"Response:  We know that Feeya has 30 pens and she wants to divide them equally among 5 pencils per box. So, we need to find out how many boxes of pencils Feeya can make with her 30 pens.

Number of pencils = Total number of pens / Number of pens in each box
= 30 / 5
= 6

So, Feeya can make 6 boxes of pencils with her 30 pens."
Response:  If Feeya had 6 pens in total and she wanted to keep them in two pencil cases of equal capacity, then each case would contain 3 pens (since 6 / 2 = 3).
Response:  We know that Feey had 35 pens in total and each pen contained 4 pens inside it. So, we have: Total number of pens = Number of pens with 1 pen inside x Number of pens with 2 pens inside = 35 x (1 + 2) = 35 x 3 = 105 pens. Therefore, Feey could make 105 pencils.
Response:  We know that there are 31 pens in total and each pen has 6 pens inside it. So, the total number of pens = 31 x 6 = 186 pens. Therefore, there are 186 pens in total.
Response:  We know that Feey has 30 pens in total and each pen contains either 71 or 24 pens inside it. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of pens = Total number of pens / Number of pens per pen  In this case, the total number of pens is 30, and the number of pens per pen is either 71 or 24 (depending on whether the pen contains 71 or 24 smaller pens). So, we have two possible equations: Equation 1: Number of pens = 30 / 71 = x Equation 2: Number of pens = 30 / 24 = y Now, we need to find out which equation is true. To do this, we will use substitution or elimination method. Let's try substitution first. Substituting x = 4 into Equation 1, we get: Number of pens = 4 / 71 = 0.56 The value of x is not a whole number, so this equation cannot be true. Therefore, Equation 2 must be true. Substituting y = 6 into Equation 2, we get: Number of pens = 30 / 24 = 6 This means that Feey has 60 pens in total (6 x 10 = 60).
Response:  We know that Feey has 16 pens and each pen contains 6 pens inside it, so the total number of pens = 16 x 6 = 96 pens. Now, we also know that each pen contains 21 pens inside it, so the total number of pens inside all the pens = 96 x 21 = 2048 pens. Therefore, the total number of pens that Feey has is 2048 pens.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classes in the school and 98 students. Since each bus can accommodate 7 students, we have: Number of buses = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 98 / 7 = 14 buses Now, let's assume all the students are seated in the buses. So, the total number of seats available in all the buses is: Total number of seats = Number of buses x Number of seats per bus = 14 x 7 = 98 seats Therefore, there are 98 seats available in all the buses.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classes in the school and each class has 30 students. So, the total number of students in the school is:

Number of classes = 84
Number of students per class = 30
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 84 x 30
= 2520
Therefore, there are 2520 students in the school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classes in the school and each class has 66 students. If each bus can accommodate only 6 students, then we need __________ (67 x 66) = 4120 buses to transport all the students.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classes in the school and each class has an equal number of students. So, the total number of students in the school is 87 x 58 = 4960. Since each bus can accommodate only 2 students at a time, we need (4960 / 2) = 248 buses to transport all the students. Therefore, the required number of buses for yatra (journey) is 248.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classes in the school and each class has an equal number of students. So, the total number of students in all classes is 24 x 120 = 2880. Since there are 84 seats in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 84 to find out how many students can fit in each bus. Therefore, the number of students who can fit in each bus is 2880 / 84 = 35.
Response:  We know that there are 66 classes in school and 102 students. Each bus can accommodate 8 students at most. So, we need to divide 102 students among 8 seats per bus. To find out how many buses are needed, we can divide 102 students by 8 seats per bus: 102 / 8 = 13 Therefore, we need 13 buses for transportation.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classes in school and 11 students in total. Each class has 99 seats, so we can calculate the number of students who go for trips as follows: Number of students going for trips = Total number of students x Number of classes per student / Number of seats per class = (11 x 102) / 99 = 56 Therefore, 56 students will go for trips.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classes in the school and each bus can accommodate 3 students. So, we need to divide 72 by 3 to find out how many buses will be required for transportation purposes.  Therefore, the number of buses needed is: 72 / 3 = 24.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classes in the school and 92 students in total. Since all buses are full, each bus has 46 students. Therefore, the number of seats in each bus is: Number of students / Total number of students = 46/92 = 0.5 (or half) So, each bus has 50 seats.
"Response:  If Haley likes all the boys in Class 11 to play gubbare (a popular Indian board game), and she gives each boy 9 bulbules (small balls used for playing the game), then the total number of bulbules Haley gave out is:

Number of boys = 11
Number of bulbules given per boy = 9
Total number of bulbules = Number of boys x Number of bulbules given per boy
= 11 x 9
= 99 bulbules
Therefore, there were 99 bulbules in total that Haley gave out to the boys in Class 11."
Response:  If Haley has 10 gumballs and gives each of the 5 boys she knows 5 gumballs, then how many gumballs did she give in total to all the boys?  So, the answer is 5 x 5 = 25 gumballs.
Response:  There are 23 gumballs in total and Haley wants to keep 15 for herself. So, we need to find out how many gumballs each boy will get.  We can divide the total number of gumballs (23) by the number of boys (4). Therefore, each boy will get:  Number of gumballs per boy = Total number of gumballs / Number of boys = 23 / 4 = 5.75 gumballs per boy Since you cannot have a fraction of a gumball, each boy will get exactly 5 gumballs.
Response:  We have to distribute 13 boys and 50 girls among 26 bulbuls (birds).  To do this, we need to divide 13 and 50 by 26.  When we divide 13 by 26, we get 0.5. So each boy will get 0.5 bulbul. Similarly, when we divide 50 by 26, we get 1.923076923076924. So each girl will get approximately 1.9 bulbuls. Therefore, each of the 13 boys will get 0.5 bulbul, and each of the 50 girls will get approximately 1.9 bulbuls.
Response:  There are 20 balls in total and two boys playing the game. If they take turns picking up one ball each time, then after 10 rounds (or 10 turns), there will be 5 balls left. Since there are only two boys, they will get 5 balls each after 10 rounds. So, the final answer is 5 x 2 = 10 balls per boy.
Response:  If Helly has 28 gumballs and she gives each of the boys two gumballs, then how many boys did she give gumballs to in total?  We can count them as follows:  Boys who got 0 gumballs = 0 x 2 = 0 Boys who got 1 gumball = 4 Boys who got 2 gumballs = 8 Total number of boys who got gumballs from Helly = 0 + 4 + 8 = 12 So, Helly gave gumballs to 12 boys in total.
Response:  We know that Frank read 392 pages of his favorite book in total and he read 14 pages every day. To find out how many days it took him to finish reading the entire book, we can use the following formula: Total number of days = Total number of pages / Daily reading speed Where daily reading speed is the number of pages read per day. In this case, Frank read at a rate of 14 pages per day, so: Total number of days = 392 pages / 14 pages/day = 27 days Therefore, it took Frank 27 days to finish reading his favorite book entirely.
"Response:  We know that Franky read 22 pages every day and it took him 569 days to complete the book. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

Total pages = Number of days x Number of pages read per day
= 569 x 22
= 12380

Therefore, there are 12380 pages in the book."
Response:  We know that Frank read 612 pages of his favorite book in total. Since there were 24 chapters in the book, each chapter had 25 pages (612 / 24 = 25). So, Frank read one chapter every day for 6 days to finish reading the entire book. Therefore, he read 25 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read 555 pages of his favorite book and it was divided into 5 chapters with equal number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Now, we are given that Frank took 220 days to complete reading the book. Therefore, we can use this information to find out how many pages he read per day. The formula for finding out the number of pages read per day is: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Time taken to complete the book In this case, the total number of pages is 555, and the time taken to complete the book is 220 days. Substituting these values in the above equation, we get: Number of pages read per day = 555 / 220 = 2.5 pages/day Now, since Frank read 555 pages in total, we can calculate the number of pages he read per chapter as follows: Number of pages read per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 555 / 5 = 111 pages/chapter Therefore, each chapter had approximately 111 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank read 193 pages of his favorite book in total, and each page had 15 chapters or sections. So, he read 193 / 15 = 12.87 chapters per day on average. Since there were 660 days taken to complete reading the entire book, Frank read 660 x 12.87 = 840.63 chapters in total.
Response:  Frrank read 249 pages in each book and took 3 days to complete one book. Therefore, he read 867 pages (249 x 3) in total during his reading spree.
Response:  If Frank read one book in 12 days and there were 66 pages in each book, then he read a total of 66 x 12 = 792 pages in all the books. Now, if it took him 492 days to finish reading all the books, then he had read a fraction of the total number of pages equal to 792 / 492 = 1.6 pages per day. So, Frank read 160 books (1.6 x 100) in total.
Response:  If Frank was reading his favorite book for 16 days and there were 112 pages in the book, then we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:  Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages is 112, and the number of days taken to read the book is 16. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get the answer: Number of pages read per day = 112 / 16 = 7 pages per day Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day for 16 days.
"Response:  If Franky reads 8 pages per day and there are 576 pages in total, then we can calculate the number of days it would take him to finish reading the book as follows:

Days = Total Pages / Daily Reading
= 576 / 8
= 72 days

Therefore, if Franky continues reading at this pace, it will take him 72 days to read the entire book."
"Response:  We know that Frank was reading his favorite book for 30 days to complete it fully. Since there are 450 pages in the book and Frank read 41 chapters (out of 41) every day, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows:

Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to complete the book
= 450 pages / 30 days
= 15 pages/day
Therefore, Frank read 15 pages of his favorite book every day for 30 days."
"Response:  We know that there are three chapters in the book, and each chapter has 594 pages. So, the total number of pages in the book is:

3 x 594 = 1782 pages

Now, we are told that Frank read the entire book in 607 days. This means he read one page every day. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per day is:

1782 pages / 607 days = 2.9 pages/day

So, the answer to the question is 2.9 pages/day."
Response:  We know that Frank read 2 chapters of his favorite book and each chapter had 405 pages. Therefore, he read a total of 810 pages in those two chapters (405 x 2 = 810). Now, we are told that it took him 664 days to finish reading the entire book. So, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages in the book / Time taken to read the book In this case, the total number of pages in the book is 810 x 2 = 1620 pages. Substituting this value into the formula above, we get: Number of pages read per day = 1620 pages / 664 days = 2.5 pages/day Based on this calculation, Frank read approximately 2.5 pages every day during the time he spent reading his favorite book.
Response:  We have to buy 6 packs of DeviDii dolls worth $120 in total. Since each pack contains 3 dolls, we can calculate the cost per doll as follows: Number of Packs = Total amount / Price of one pack = 120 / 20 = 6 So, the cost per doll is: Cost per Doll = Total amount / Number of Packs = 120 / 6 = 20 dollars per doll. Therefore, each pack of DeviDii dolls costs $20.
Response:  If each pack of 81 dollars contains 33 DVDs, then we need to calculate how much one DVD costs in terms of US dollars.  To do this, we can divide the cost of one pack (81 dollars) by the number of DVDs it contains (33). So, the cost of one DVD is: $81 / 33 = $2.57 per DVD. Therefore, if you buy 33 DVDs, you will have to pay $2.57 x 33 = $84.10.
Response:  The cost of each DeviDee pack is $107. If there is a discount of $106 on each pack, then the effective price per pack becomes $1 = $107 - $106 = $1. So, you can buy 93 DeviDee packs for $93.
"Response:  If each package costs $76 and there is a discount of $25 on each package, then the cost of one package after discount would be:
$76 - ($25 x number of packages) =?
Now, we need to find out how many packages you want to buy. So, let's say you want to buy x packages. Then, the total cost of all the packages you are buying will be:
Total Cost = Number of Packages x Cost per Package
= x x $76
Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get:
Total Cost = x x $76
= 76x
So, if you want to buy x packages, the total amount you will have to pay is $76x."
Response:  If you have $104 and each package costs $26, then how many packages can you buy? To find out, divide $104 by $26: $104 ÷ $26 = 4 So, you can buy 4 packages of Devi Devices.
Response:  We have to buy 2 packs of DeviiDeeDies for $28. Since each pack contains 2 dies, we can calculate the price of each die as follows: Price of one die = Total cost of two packs / Number of packs = $28 / 2 = $14 per die. Therefore, the price of each die is $14.
Response:  We know that there are 18 balls in total and they are divided into two groups of different sizes. So, we can say that each group has a certain number of balls. Now, let's assume that each group contains half of the total number of balls (since it is mentioned that the balls are divided into two groups). Therefore, the number of balls in Group A = Number of balls in Group B = 9 balls.  Hence, there are 9 sampoohs in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 187 cells in an adult human body and each cell has a volume of approximately 140 cubic micrometers (μm3). So, to find out how many cells are present in 140 sampoohos (units) of a certain tissue or organ, we can use the following calculation: Number of cells = Volume of tissue/Volume of a single cell Therefore, if we assume that all 187 cells are equally distributed throughout the entire body, then the number of cells in one sampooha (unit) of any tissue or organ would be: Number of cells = 187 x (140 μm3 / 1 μm3) = 25,960,000 cells Now, since you mentioned ""kele"" specifically, let's apply this calculation for the bone marrow, which is where red blood cells are produced. The average volume of a bone marrow cavity is around 140 cubic centimeters (cm3), so the number of red blood cells produced in one bone marrow cavity would be: Number of red blood cells = 25,960,000 cells / 140 cm3 = approximately 182 million red blood cells per bone marrow cavity."
Response:  We have 203 balls and 63 sticks. If we divide them into 7 groups of balls and 95 groups of sticks, then each group will contain how many objects?  To find out, let's use division.  The number of objects in each group is equal to the total number of objects divided by the number of groups. So, if there are 203 balls and 63 sticks, and we divide them into 7 groups of balls and 95 groups of sticks, then each group of balls will contain 203/7 = 29 balls, and each group of sticks will contain 63/95 = 0.66 sticks.
Response:  We know that there are 142 circles and 356 triangles in the diagram. If we divide the circles into 47 groups of equal size, each group will contain $\frac{142}{47} = 3$ circles. Similarly, if we divide the triangles into 178 groups of equal size, each group will contain $\frac{356}{178} = 2$ triangles. Therefore, the length of each triangle is $2$.
"Response:  We know that there are 196 committees in total and each committee has 39 members. So, we have:
Number of committees = Total number of members / Number of members per committee
= 196 / 39
= 5
So, there are 5 committees in the entire organization with 39 members each."
Response:  We know that there are 18 shapes in total in Philip's collection. If we multiply this number by 10 (since each shape has 10 units), then we get 180 units of area for all the shapes combined. So, there are 180 shapes in Philip's collection.
"Response:  We have 87 santars and 290 keles in total. If we divide them into two groups of 49 each (i.e., 49 santars + 49 keles), then the average size of each group will be:

Group 1 (49 santars): Average size = Number of santars / Total number of objects = 49/87 = 5.6

Group 2 (49 keles): Average size = Number of keles / Total number of objects = 49/290 = 0.17

So, if we divide the 87 santars and 290 keles into two groups of 49 each, the average size of each group will be approximately 5.6 for the first group and 0.17 for the second group."
Response:  We have to find out how many squares will be formed when we divide 384 rectangles into 345 groups of equal size and then further divide each group into 16 smaller groups of equal size.  To do this, we need to use division and multiplication calculations.  First, let's calculate the number of rectangles in each group of 345:  Number of rectangles in each group = Total number of rectangles / Number of groups = 384 / 345 = 10  So there are 10 rectangles in each group of 345. Now, let's calculate the number of squares that will be formed when we divide each group of 10 rectangles into 16 smaller groups of equal size:  Number of squares in each group = Total number of rectangles / Number of smaller groups = 10 / 16 = 0.625  So there will be approximately 0.625 squares in each group of 10 rectangles. Since we have 384 rectangles in total, the total number of squares that will be formed is:  Total number of squares = Number of rectangles x Approximate number of squares per rectangle = 384 x 0.625 = 237.5  Therefore, there will be approximately 237.5 squares formed when we divide 384 rectangles into 345 groups of equal size and then further divide each group into 16 smaller groups of equal size.
"Response:  If she had prepared 38 kukis and each of them contained 19 kukis, then...

The number of mehmanos (friends) for whom she made kukis = Number of kukis prepared x Number of kukis in each kuki
= 38 x 19
= 672
Therefore, she made kukis for 672 mehmanos."
Response:  If Brand's mother had made 14 kukis for each of her 14 children (including Brand), then she would have made a total of 14 x 14 = 196 kukis.  Since each kuki has 30 pieces, Brand's mother would have prepared 196 x 30 = 5840 pieces of kuki.
Response:  Mother had made 5 kukis for Brand. She prepared 22 kukis in total but managed to make only 17 of them. If each kuki has only one number, then how many numbers were there in total among all the kukis that mother made? Solution:  We know that the total number of kukis that mother made was 22. Out of these, she managed to make 17 kukis. So, the remaining 5 kukis did not get made. Therefore, the total number of numbers among all the kukis that mother made is 5.
Response:  Mother Brand made 10 kukis for 10 guests but only 9 guests arrived. If she had prepared 18 kukis and each guest received one kuki, then how many kukis would each guest have received? Solution:  Number of kukis received by each guest = Total number of kukis prepared x Number of guests who arrived / Total number of guests  Number of kukis received by each guest = 18 x 9 / 10 = 16 So each guest received 16 kukis.
Response:  If Brandi's mother made 14 cookies for two men, then each man got how many cookies?  Since there are only two men, and they both received an equal number of cookies, we can conclude that each man received 7 cookies (since 14 / 2 = 7). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  If there are 10 guests and each guest has 2 kukis, then the total number of kukis required to make for all the guests is 10 x 2 = 20 kukis. So, if the host had made 10 kukis in total, he/she would have made enough kukis for 5 guests (since 10 / 2 = 5).
Response:  We know that Frank has 42 tukdes of money in total. If he wants to divide them equally among 2 bags, then each bag will contain how many tukdes?  So, the number of candies in each bag = Total amount of money / Number of bags.  In this case, the number of candies in each bag = 42 / 2 = 21 candies. Therefore, there are 21 candies in each bag.
Response:  If Frank had some coins in his pocket and he put them all in 26 bags of 33 coins each, then we can calculate the total number of coins as follows: Number of coins = Total number of bags x Number of coins per bag = 26 x 33 = 840 coins So, there were 840 coins in Frank's pocket.
Response:  Frrank had 33 coins and lost 24 of them. So, he has 9 coins left. Now, if we assume that each bag can hold 9 coins, then Frank will have 3 bags (since he has 9 coins left). Therefore, the number of bags Frank has is 3.
Response:  If Frank has already filled each bag with 11 tufts of rice, and he wants to fill each bag completely (i.e., without any empty space), then the total number of bags he can make will be equal to the total number of tufts of rice he has.  Therefore, if he has 22 tufts of rice in total, he can make 22 / 11 = 2 bags.
Response:  If Frank has 16 pieces of mithai and he wants to distribute them equally among 2 bags, then each bag will have 8 pieces of mithai (16/2 = 8).
Response:  Shalini has sold 25 boxes of truffles. If each box contains 14 truffles, then we need to divide 25 by 14 to find out how many boxes she needs to deliver. So, Shalini needs to deliver 1750 truffles (25 / 14 = 1750).
Response:  Sharli sold 10 boxes of truffles. Each box contains 5 truffles. So, in total, Sharli sold 50 truffles (10 boxes x 5 truffles/box).
"Response:  We know that there were 67 bottles of normal soda and 9 diet sodas in total. Now, we need to find out how many more bottles of normal soda were there than diet sodas. So, let's subtract the number of diet sodas from the total number of bottles:

Total number of bottles = 67 + 9 = 76
Now, we can see that there are 19 more bottles of normal soda (76 - 9 = 67). Therefore, there were 19 more bottles of normal soda than diet sodas."
"Response:  We know that in one shop, there were 22 bottles of normal soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. To find out how many more bottles of diet soda there were than normal soda, we can subtract their numbers:

Number of bottles of diet soda = Number of bottles of normal soda - (22 + 61)
= 22 - 83
= -61
So, there were 61 fewer bottles of diet soda than normal soda in the shop."
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of kerosene in the store and 8 bottles of diesel were sold. So, the total number of bottles left = 30 - 8 = 22. Now, we are told that 41 seeds were also present in the store. Since each seed is approximately equal to 0.57 milliliters (mL), we can calculate the total volume of all the seeds as follows: Volume of seeds = Number of seeds x Volume of one seed = 41 x 0.57 mL = 23.63 mL Therefore, the total volume of liquids in the store was 22 + 23.63 = 45.63 mL.
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of milk in total and 53 bottles of diet soda. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is:  Total bottles - Bottles of diet soda = 79 - 53 = 26. Therefore, there were 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that in one corner store, there were 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

Number of bottles of regular soda = 83
Number of bottles of diet soda = 54
Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda were available than diet soda:
Difference between number of regular soda and number of diet soda = Number of regular soda - Number of diet soda
= 83 - 54
= 29
So, there were 29 more bottles of regular soda available than diet soda in the corner store."
Response:  We know that there were 17 bottles in total and 9 of them were ordinary salt bottles (sodium chloride). So, the number of diet sodas bottles = Total - Number of ordinary salt bottles = 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, there were 8 diet soda bottles.
Response:  We know that in one Kirane diary shop, there were 19 bottles of soft drinks and 60 bottles of normal water. Now we have to find out how many more bottles of normal water were sold than soft drinks. So, let X be the number of bottles of normal water sold excess over soft drinks. According to the question, the total number of bottles of both is 19 + 60 = 79. Therefore, X = 79 - 19 = 60. So, 60 bottles of normal water were sold excess over soft drinks in the given scenario.
Response:  We know that there were 72 bottles of kerosene in the store and 32 diet sodas. So, the total number of bottles was 72 + 32 = 104 bottles. Now, we are asked how many more bottles of seeds were available with them. Since they had 78 seeds, so the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of seeds is: 104 - 78 = 26 bottles. Therefore, there were 26 additional bottles of seeds available with them.
Response:  We know that there were 36 seeds in total and 80 bottles of oil. So, each bottle contained 2 seeds (since there are 80/36 = 2 seeds per bottle). Now, we need to find out how many bottles had dietary supplements. From the question, we know that 54 bottles had dietary supplements, so let's subtract this number from the total number of bottles: 80 - 54 = 26. Therefore, 26 bottles had dietary supplements.
Response:  We know that there are total 30 bottles in the store and out of them, 28 are regular sodas and remaining 2 are diet sodas. So, the number of regular sodas = 28. Now, we need to find out how many bottles of diet soda are present in the store. Since there are only 2 diet sodas left, their number is equal to 2. Therefore, the total number of bottles in the store = Number of regular sodas + Number of diet sodas = 28 + 2 = 30. Hence, there were 30 bottles in the store.
Response:  We know that there were 4 bottles of diet soda in the store and each bottle contained 12 fluid ounces (fl oz). So, the total number of fl oz of diet soda in the store was: 4 x 12 = 48 fl oz. Now, we are told that if they had sold these bottles at a discount of 79 cents per bottle, then they would have made $3.65 (= $0.79 x 48) in revenue from these bottles. Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda that they sold was: $3.65 / ($0.79 per bottle) = 48/0.79 = 60 bottles.
"Response:  We know that there were 57 bottles in total. Out of these, 26 bottles contained diet soda and 27 bottles contained light soda. So, the number of bottles containing neither diet nor light soda is:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles containing diet soda + Number of bottles containing light soda - Number of bottles containing neither diet nor light soda
= 26 + 27 - 0
= 53

Therefore, there were 53 bottles containing neither diet nor light soda."
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of kerosene in total. Out of these, 60 bottles contain diesel and 60 bottles contain light oil. So, the total number of bottles containing non-kerosene products is 60 x 2 = 120 bottles. Now, we need to find out how many more bottles of kerosene were sold than the total number of bottles containing non-kerosene products. To do this, we can subtract the number of non-kerosene bottles from the total number of bottles: 81 - 120 = -41 bottles. Therefore, there were 41 fewer bottles of kerosene sold than the total number of bottles containing non-kerosene products.
Response:  The total number of bottles in the store is 49. Out of these, 40 bottles were filled with diet soda and 6 bottles were filled with light soda. So, the total number of bottles filled with soda = 40 + 6 = 46 bottles. Therefore, the number of bottles left empty = 49 - 46 = 3 bottles.
Response:  If there were 317 agnati in the Bakinigham Pales after they had eaten well, and if there were 295 agnati in the previous day, then we can calculate the difference between the two days as follows:  Difference = 317 - 295 = 22 Therefore, there were 22 more agnati in the Bakinigham Pales on the second day than on the first day.
"Response:  If there were 703 Agantukas in the previous days and they stayed for 25 days, then the total number of people who visited Bakinigham Pales during that time would be:

Total number of visitors = Number of Agantukas x Stay duration
= 703 x 25
= 17,550
Therefore, 17,550 people visited Bakinigham Pales during those 25 days."
Response:  If they had eaten well for 100 days before going to Bakigram Palace and if there were 666 more agantuk in that day than the previous day, then we can calculate it as follows:  Number of Agantuks = Total number of Agantuks x Percentage increase  Number of Agantuks = 100 x (666/50)  Number of Agantuks = 100 x 13.2  Number of Agantuks = 1320  So, there were 1320 more Agantuks in the palace on that day compared to the previous day.
Response:  If they saw 132 Agantuk in Bakigram Pales after eating a good meal, and if there were 406 people who had been to Bakigram Pales in the past 327 days, then we can calculate the number of Agantuks that went to Bakigram Pales in each of those 327 days as follows:  Number of Agantuks = Total number of Agantuks seen / Total number of days So, the number of Agantuks that went to Bakigram Pales in each of the last 327 days is :  Number of Agantuks per day = 132/327 = 0.40 (approximately) Therefore, approximately 40 Agantuks went to Bakigram Pales every day over the last 327 days.
Response:  If they saw 45 agnatha in the last 85 days after eating a good meal, and there were 829 people who had this experience over an 85-day period, then we can calculate how many agnatha each person would have seen during that time as follows:  Number of agnatha per person = Total number of agnatha / Number of people So, if 45 agnatha were seen in the last 85 days by one person, then the total number of agnatha must be: Total number of agnatha = 45 x 829 = 36,775 Now, to find out how many agnatha each person saw during the entire 85-day period, we divide the total number of agnatha by the number of people: Number of agnatha per person = Total number of agnatha / Number of people = 36,775 / 829 = 44.15 Therefore, each person would have seen approximately 44.15 agnatha during the entire 85-day period.
Response:  We know that after eating a good meal, they went to see the paintings in Bakinigham Palace and found 71 paintings there. If they had seen 557 paintings earlier in the day, then the number of days since their last visit must be 57 days. So, the number of people who visited Bakinigham Palace during these 57 days is:  Number of people = Total number of paintings / Number of days = 557 / 57 = 9  Therefore, 9 people visited Bakinigham Palace during these 57 days.
Response:  We know that after eating a good meal, they went to see the paintings in Bakinigham Palace and found 39 paintings there. If they had seen 661 paintings earlier in the day, then the difference between the number of paintings they saw earlier and the number of paintings they saw later is equal to the number of paintings they saw earlier minus 600. So, the number of additional paintings they saw later is 661 - 600 = 61. Therefore, the answer is 61.
Response:  We know that after eating a good meal, they went to see the elephant show and saw 92 elephants there. If in the previous day, there were 419 elephants and 103 elephants had come before that day, then how many people had seen the elephant show before that day?  Therefore, the number of people who saw the elephant show before that day is:  Number of people = (Number of elephants in the previous day - Number of elephants in the current day) + 103  Number of people = (419 - 92) + 103  Number of people = 326  So, 326 people had seen the elephant show before that day.
Response:  If there were 512 agantukas in Bakigram Palaces after a good meal, and if there were 471 agantukas before that meal, then the difference between the two numbers is 41 (512 - 471).  Now, we know that the number of agantukas increased by 41 in those 89 days. So, the number of agantukas in Bakigram Palace after 89 days is:  471 + (41 x 89) = 563  Therefore, during the last 89 days, 563 people came to Bakigram Palace.
Response:  If there were 705 agantukas in Bakigram Palaces after a good meal, and if there were 191 agantukas before that meal, then we can calculate the increase as follows:  Increase = Total number of agantukas after meal - Total number of agantukas before meal = 705 - 191 = 514 agantukas So, during the last 245 days, there were 514 more agantukas in Bakigram Palace than there were earlier.
Response:  We know that there are total 628 grams of momo required and we have to find out how many grams of momo were available before making the next batch. So, let's assume that the number of grams of momo available before making the next batch is x. Now, we know that the recipe requires 159 grams of momo for each batch, so the total number of grams of momo required for one batch is 159x. Since we want to make n batches, the total number of grams of momo required is 159nx. Therefore, the remaining amount of momo after making n batches is given by: Remaining momo = Total momo - (159nx) = 628 - (159n(x)) = 469n(x).
Response:  We know that there are 49 grams of color required to paint all the boxes, and we also know that Mom has already painted 260 grams of paint onto the boxes so far. So, if we subtract the amount of paint that Mom has already used (260 grams) from the total amount of paint required (49 grams), we get: 260 - 49 = 211 grams. Therefore, there are 211 grams of paint left over after Mom has painted some of the boxes.
Response:  We know that there are total 57 grams of color required to paint all the boxes, and Mom has provided 22 grams of color so far. Therefore, the remaining amount of color needed is: 57 - 22 = 35 grams. If we had already painted some boxes before, then the total amount of color used would be: Total amount of color used = Number of boxes painted x Amount of color required per box = 353 - 35 = 318 grams.
Response:  We know that for every pankh (piece of cloth), 166 grams of moh are required. Now, out of 20 grams available with him, he has already used 5 grams (since 5/20 = 0.25). So, the remaining amount of moh required to complete one piece of cloth is: 20 - 5 = 15 grams. Therefore, the number of pieces of cloth he can make from his remaining 20 grams of moh is: 15 / 166 = 0.09.
Response:  We know that there are 557 grams of momo and we need to calculate how many grams of momo are required for each pankh. Since there are 17 panks in total, we can divide the total amount of momo by the number of panks to find out the required amount of momo per pank. So, the required amount of momo per pank is: 557 grams / 17 panks = 32.6 grams per pank.
Response:  We know that there are 11 grams of mold in the current situation and pancakes need 492 grams of mold altogether. So, we can calculate the number of grams of mold required for each pancake as follows: Number of grams of mold per pancake = Total amount of mold needed / Number of pancakes needed = 492 grams / 11 pancakes = 44.6 grams per pancake Therefore, each pancake requires approximately 44.6 grams of mold.
Response:  We know that 94 people have told us that they eat 90 bars of angora in 6 days. So, we need to find out how many angoras each person eats per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of angoras (90) by the number of days (6): Number of angoras per day = Total number of angoras / Number of days = 90 / 6 = 15 angoras per day. Therefore, each person eats 15 angoras per day.
"Response:  We know that 266 people have told us that they eat 90 dram of angora in 5 days. Now, we need to calculate how many borers (a unit of measurement for angora) each person eats per day. To do this, we can divide the total amount of angora eaten by the number of people who ate it:

Total amount of angora eaten = 266 x 90 = 23,440 dram
Number of people = 266

Now, let's divide the total amount of angora eaten by the number of people:

Number of borers per day = Total amount of angora eaten / Number of people = 23,440 / 266 = 87.17 borers per day
Therefore, approximately 87.17 borers of angora are consumed by each person in 5 days."
Response:  We know that there are 294 people who have given this information and they eat an average of 244 dram of angur per day. So, in total, they will eat 244 x 146 = 35,084 dram of angur during these 146 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 235 crows in total and they eat 100 dram of rasberry per day. So, the number of days it will take for them to finish all the berries is:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total amount of berries}}{\text{Amount of berries eaten per day}} $$

Given that there are 221 dram of angoor (peas) available, we can calculate the number of days it will take for the crows to finish them as follows:

$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total amount of peas}}{\text{Amount of peas eaten per day}} $$

So, the final answer is:

$$ \boxed{\text{It will take approximately }77\text{ days for the crows to finish both the berries and peas.}} $$"
"Response:  We know that there are 57 steps in total and each step has 108 dram of angur (ginger). So, the total amount of angur consumed in one go is:

$$ \therefore Total\space Angur = 57 \times 108 = 6346 $$

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for 58 people to consume this much angur. To do this, we can divide the total amount of angur by the number of people:

$$ \therefore Days = 6346 / 58 = 110 $$

So, it will take approximately 110 days for 58 people to consume 6346 dram of angur."
Response:  We know that 36 people eat 8 dram of angora per day. 1 dram = 37.5 grams So, in total, these 36 people consume 8 x 37.5 = 300 grams of angora per day. To calculate how many days it will take to consume 240 barrels of angora, we need to divide the total amount of angora consumed daily by the number of barrels. Therefore, 300 grams / 240 barrels = 1.25 days. So, it will take approximately 1.25 days for 36 people to consume 240 barrels of angora.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 different types of animals in each enclosure, and each enclosure has 52 water-loving animals in total. Therefore, the number of water-loving animals in one enclosure is:

Number of water-loving animals in one enclosure = Number of different types of animals x Total number of animals in each enclosure
= 26 x 52
= 1320

So, there are 1320 water-loving animals in each enclosure."
Response:  We know that there are different species of fish in each aquarium (40 total). Each aquarium has 2 fish. So, we need to find out how many aquariums there were. Therefore, the number of aquariums is equal to the total number of fish divided by 2, which is 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that there are 56 species of fish in the freshwater aquarium and 10 species of brackish water animals for which the tank is suitable. Each species has 39 individuals. Therefore, the total number of fish in the tank is:  Number of freshwater aquarium species x Number of individuals per species = 56 x 39 = 2174 fish. Similarly, the number of brackish water animals is:  Number of brackish water animal species x Number of individuals per species = 10 x 39 = 390 animals. So, the total number of living beings in the tank is: 2174 + 390 = 2564 living beings.
Response:  We know that there are 74 mice and 22 frogs in each equation. Since we have 5 equations, the total number of mice is 74 x 5 = 370. Similarly, the total number of frogs is 22 x 5 = 110. Therefore, there are 370 mice and 110 frogs in the tank.
"Response:  For the first group of 15 animals that need water, there are 19 animals in each equation. So, the total number of animals in this group is:

15 x 19 = 285

For the second group of 62 animals that need water, there are also 19 animals in each equation. So, the total number of animals in this group is:

62 x 19 = 1174

Therefore, the total number of animals in both groups is:

285 + 1174 = 1459

So, there are 1459 animals in total."
Response:  If Maa buys 13 t-shirts in one package, then she will have 13 packages of t-shirts.  If she buys 39 t-shirts altogether, then she will have 39 / 13 = 3 packages of t-shirts.
Response:  If Maa buys 66 safed t-shirts and each package contains 3 safed t-shirts, then the number of packages she will get is: 66 / 3 = 22 packages.
Response:  If Maa buys 28 packets of sweets and each packet contains 56 t-shirts, then we can calculate the number of t-shirts in each packet as follows: Number of t-shirts = Total number of t-shirts / Number of packets = 56 x 28 = 1576 t-shirts So, there are 1576 t-shirts in total.
Response:  If Maa buys 53 shirts in one pack and she buys another pack of 34 shirts, then altogether she has bought 87 shirts (53 + 34). So, there are 87 shirts in total.
"Response:  Maa has 51 t-shirts to buy. If she buys them in three packets of 17 each, then how many packets will she have?

Answer: 3 packets"
Response:  If Maa buys 70 white t-shirts and she buys them in packages of 14 each, then we can find out how many white t-shirts are there in each package as follows: Number of white t-shirts in each package = Total number of white t-shirts / Number of packages = 70 / 14 = 5 So, there are 5 white t-shirts in each package.
Response:  If there are 4 bags of equal weight and together they weigh 36 kg, then each bag must weigh 9 kg (36/4 = 9).
Response:  If you have 33 kukis and each bag contains 11 kukis, then: Total number of bags = Number of kukis / Number of kukis in each bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags So, there are 3 bags containing kukis.
Response:  If there are 41 kukiz in each bag and you have 53 bags, then the total number of kukiz = Total number of bags x Number of kukiz per bag = 53 x 41 = 2193 kukiz.
Response:  If there are 14 coins in total and each bag contains an equal number of coins as the number of bags, then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of coins in one bag = Total number of coins / Number of bags So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Number of coins in one bag = 14 / 7 = 2 Therefore, there are 2 coins in each bag.
Response:  If there are 3 kukiz in each bag and you have a total of 21 kukiz, then the number of bags = Total number of kukiz / Number of kukiz in each bag. So, the number of bags = 21/3 = 7 bags. Therefore, there are 7 bags containing 3 kukiz each.
Response:  If there are 26 bags of rice and you have 15 candies, then the total number of items is 26 + 15 = 41. Now, if you also have 52 kukis, then the total number of items is 41 + 52 = 93. So, there are 93 kukis in your possession.
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags of rice in total and we have 28 kukis (bags) + 86 candies = 114 items altogether. Since each bag contains 5 kg of rice, the number of bags of rice is equal to the total weight of all items divided by 5 kg per bag. So, Number of bags of rice = Total weight of items / 5 kg per bag = 114 / 5 = 23 bags of rice. Therefore, there are 23 bags of rice.
"Response:  If one daakiya can deliver 5 jank to each block and there are total 10 blocks in the area, then the number of janks delivered by the daakiya is:

Janks delivered = Number of blocks x Number of janks per block
= 10 x 5
= 50 janks

Now, if the daakiya delivers 25 mel to each house in a block, then the number of houses in a block is:

Houses in a block = Total number of houses / Amount of mel delivered per house
= 50 / 25
= 2 houses

So, there are 2 houses in each block. Since there are 10 blocks in the area, the total number of houses in the area is:

Total number of houses = Number of blocks x Number of houses in each block
= 10 x 2
= 20 houses

Therefore, there are 20 houses in the area."
"Response:  If one daakiya can deliver 9 jank mel tukdars to each of the 16 houses in a block (i.e., total number of houses in a block = 16), then the number of jank mel tukdars that one daakiya needs to deliver to each house in a block is:

Jank mel tukdars per house in a block = Total number of houses in a block / Number of daakias available
= 16 / 1
= 16

So, if there are 20 houses in a block, then the number of jank mel tukdars that one daakiya needs to deliver to each house in a block is:

Jank mel tukdars per house in a block = Total number of houses in a block / Number of daakias available
= 20 / 1
= 20

Therefore, the answer is 20 jank mel tukdars for each block with 20 houses."
Response:  If there are 6 houses in one block and each house gets 24 junk mail pieces from the dairy, then the total number of junk mail pieces that need to be delivered to all six houses is 6 x 24 = 144. So, each house needs 144/6 = 24 junk mail pieces.
Response:  If one daakiya can deliver 14 mel in each block and there are total 5 blocks, then the total number of mel delivered by one daakiya = 14 x 5 = 70 mel. Now, if we divide this total number of mel by 2 (as per the given information), we get the number of houses in each block = 70 / 2 = 35 houses. Therefore, there are 35 houses in each block.
Response:  We have to distribute 32 janks among 20 houses in each block. So, we need to divide 32 by 20 = 1.6. Therefore, each house will get 1.6 janks.
Response:  We have to distribute 78 blocks among 78 blocks, and each block has 30 janks. So, we need to divide 78 by 30 = 260 janks. Since there are 19 houses in one block, we need to divide 260 by 19 = 14 janks per house. Therefore, each house will get 14 janks.
Response:  If one Dakia can deliver 8 janks of water to each of the 55 blocks, then in total, it will deliver 55 x 8 = 440 janks of water.  Now, if it delivers 32 janks of water to each of the 16 houses in one block, then in total, it will deliver 16 x 32 = 512 janks of water. So, there are 512 / 440 = 1.17 blocks in one block. Therefore, there are approximately 1.17 blocks in one block.
"Response:  If one daakiya can deliver 81 blocks of 4 janks each in total, then the number of janks delivered to each block will be:

Number of blocks = Total number of blocks / Number of daakias
= 81 / 1
= 81

Now, let's find out how many janks are needed for each block:

Janks per block = Total number of janks / Number of blocks
= 81 / 12
= 6.75 (round off to 7)

So, each block needs 7 janks."
Response:  We have to distribute 16 blocks of 4 balls each among 17 houses in one block. So, we will divide 16 / 17 = 0.94 (approximately) blocks for each house. Since each block contains 4 balls, we will give approximately 0.94 x 4 = 3.76 balls to each house. Therefore, the total number of balls required to be given is 3.76 x 17 = 62.52 balls.
Response:  We have to divide 40 into 4 groups of equal size. To find out how many groups we can make, we need to divide 40 by the number of items in each group. Since Rebeka has 10 andes and 20 gold coins, let's assume that one group contains an equal number of both - 5 andes and 3 gold coins per group. So, now we can calculate the total number of groups as follows: Number of groups = Total amount / Amount per group = 40 / (5 andes + 3 gold coins) = 40/8 = 5 groups Now, we know that Rebeka can make 5 groups of 40 items each.
Response:  We have to divide 50 andes (5 x 10 = 50) into groups of 3 or more andes each. So we will make 5 groups. Now let's see how many groups we can make with 10 gobbaras (10 / 3 = 3) and 15 andes (15 / 3 = 5). We can make 3 groups of 3 andes each using all 15 andes and 2 groups of 5 andes each using all 10 gobbaras. Therefore, there will be 3 + 2 = 5 groups in total.
Response:  We have to divide 11 into 11 parts of equal size. Each part can contain either 0 or 1 elephant. So, we need to find out how many elephants Rebeka has in total. If each part contains 1 elephant, then Rebeka has 11 elephants. But if each part contains 0 elephants, then Rebeka doesn't have any elephants. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  We have to divide 40 andes (4 x 10 = 40) into 4 groups of equal size. Since Rebeka has 8 anodes and 6 bulbuls, we can distribute them as follows: Group 1: 2 anodes + 3 bulbuls Group 2: 3 anodes + 2 bulbuls Group 3: 4 anodes + 1 bulbul Group 4: 5 anodes + 0 bulbuls Total number of anodes in each group is 2 or 3, depending on whether there are odd or even numbers of groups. Therefore, the total number of anodes will be 8 / 2 = 4 anodes per group. Similarly, the total number of bulbuls will be 6 / 2 = 3 bulbuls per group.
Response:  We have to divide 30 andes (Rebeka's total collection) into 3 groups of equal size. So we need to find out how many anodes each group can accommodate. Since Rebeka has 4 gumball machines and 15 marbles in her collection, let's assume that each gumball machine contains 5 marbles (which is a rough estimate). Therefore, the total number of marbles Rebeka has = 4 x 5 = 20 marbles. Now, if we want to distribute these 20 marbles equally among 3 groups, each group will get 6-7 marbles (since 30 / 3 = 10). So, each group will contain 6 or 7 anodes.
Response:  We have to divide 18 andes into 6 groups of 3 each. So, we will make 6 groups. Now, we have 72 kelas and 66 gubbares. Each group can take 3 andes from the total amount of 18 andes. Therefore, we will need 6 x 3 = 18 groups. Hence, there will be 18 groups in total.
"Response:  We have to divide 99 into three parts such that each part contains an equal number of balls (9) and marbles (27).  One way to do this is as follows:
Part 1: 30 balls + 27 marbles = 57
Part 2: 30 balls + 9 marbles = 49
Part 3: 6 balls + 27 marbles = 33
Therefore, there will be 3 groups or sampoohs."
"Response:  We know that Rebeka has 20 ants and 6 eggs in total. Now we need to find out how many ants are there in each of the five groups. Let's assume that Rebeka divided them equally among the five groups. So, if she had X ants in Group A, then she would have (X/5) ants in each of the remaining four groups. Similarly, if she had Y ants in Group B, then she would have (Y/5) ants in each of the remaining three groups, and so on. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Number of ants in Group A = 20 / 5 = 4
Number of ants in Group B = 20 / 5 = 4
Number of ants in Group C = 16 / 5 = 3.2
Number of ants in Group D = 16 / 5 = 3.2
Number of ants in Group E = 8 / 5 = 1.6

Now, let's count the number of ants Rebeka has in each group:

Group A: 4 x 20 = 80 ants
Group B: 4 x 20 = 80 ants
Group C: 3.2 x 20 = 64 ants
Group D: 3.2 x 20 = 64 ants
Group E: 1.6 x 20 = 32 ants

So, Rebeka has a total of 80 + 80 + 64 + 64 + 32 = 372 ants."
"Response:  Rebeka has 5 gubbares and 12 andes. To divide them equally among 20 groups means each group will get:

Number of Gubbares = Total number of Gubbares / Number of Groups = 5 / 20 = 0.25 (gubbare per group)

Number of Andes = Total number of Andes / Number of Groups = 12 / 20 = 0.6 (ande per group)"
Response:  If Lyuk played 10 rounds and scored 11 points in each round, then he scored a total of 11 x 10 = 110 points. So, he played 10 rounds.
Response:  If Lyuk played 177 rounds and scored 46 points in each round, then he total score would be:  Total Score = Number of Rounds x Points per Round Total Score = 177 x 46 = 8322 points So, Lyuk scored 8322 points in the game.
Response:  Lucky played two rounds of a fair dice game and got 84 points in total. If he had received an equal number of points for each round, then he would have received 84/2 = 42 points per round. Therefore, Lucky received 42 points per round.
Response:  If Lyuk played each game for 1 minute and got 146 points in total, then he scored an average of 146/5 = 29 points per minute.  Now, if he played 157 rounds, then he scored a total of 29 x 157 = 4389 points.
Response:  If Lyuk played one game of Trivia and scored 3 points in each round, then he scored a total of 3 x 7 = 21 points in all rounds.  Now, if he scored 78 points in Trivia, then he must have played more than one game. So, the number of games he played is 78 / 3 = 26 games.
"Response:  Amilie had two friends and she lost to them in 32 games. So, in each game, there were either 1 or 2 motes involved. Therefore, the number of motes that Amilie needed to win each game was either 1 or 2. Hence, the total number of motes required for Amilie to win all 32 games is:

Total Number of Motes = Total Number of Games x Number of Motes Required per Game
= 32 x 2
= 64
Therefore, Amilie needed 64 motes to win all 32 games."
Response:  Amili lost to her friends in 11 games and won each game by 28 runs. So, she scored 28 + 28 +... + 28 = 11 \* 28 = 308 runs in total. Therefore, there were 308 motis in Emili's possession.
"Response:  We know that Amili has 8 motes in each loss and 16 motes overall. Now we need to find out how many losses Amili can have to reach her goal of 80 motes. To do this, we will divide the total number of motes she wants (80) by the number of motes she gets in each loss (8). So, the number of losses Amili can have is:

80 / 8 = 10

Therefore, Amili can have up to 10 losses to reach her goal of 80 motes."
Response:  Amili lost to her friends in 18 games and had 6 motes left. Since she won 18 games, each game required 3 motes (since there were 6 motes left). So, in each game, Amili needed 3 motes.
"Response:  If Amili lost $5 in each of the 5 games she played and won $4 in each of the remaining 4 games, then her total earnings would be:

Total earnings = (Number of wins x Winning amount) + (Number of losses x Losing amount)
= ($4 x 4) + ($5 x 1)
= $16 + $5
= $21
Therefore, Amili had $21."
Response:  Emily has 72 friends and each friend loses 3 motis in every loss. So, in total, Emily's friends lose 72 x 3 = 216 motis. Now, there are 6 losses in total, so in each loss, Emily's friends lose 216 / 6 = 36 motis. Therefore, Emily can lose up to 36 motis in each loss.
Response:  Amilie has 43 friends and she wants to distribute 5 motis equally among them. So, each friend will get 1 moti. Now, Amilie has 20 chances to win or lose. If she wins, she gets 5 motis, and if she loses, she doesn't get any. Therefore, the number of motis each friend should receive is: Number of motis = Total number of friends x Chance to win per friend = 43 x 20 = 860 motis
Response:  Amili had 44 friends and lost to Moti in each of the 26 games they played together. This means that Amili won $2$ motis in each game, since Moti won every game. Therefore, the total number of motis Amili had was $\boxed{2 \times 44 = 88}$.
Response:  We know that out of 819058 children who attended the summer camp, 431772 stayed at home during the hot season (garmi ki chutti). So, the number of children who went to the summer camp is equal to 819058 - 431772 = 387286. Now, we need to find out how many more or fewer children were present in the summer camp compared to those who stayed at home. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the total number of children attending the summer camp: 387286 - 431772 = -144506. Therefore, there were 144506 fewer children in the summer camp than at home.
Response:  We know that out of 202958 children who attend summer camp, 777622 remain at home. So, we can calculate the ratio of children attending summer camp to those remaining at home as follows:  Ratio = Number of children attending summer camp / Total number of children (i.e., 202958 - 777622)  = 431/67656 = 0.063 or approximately 6.3%  Therefore, approximately 6.3% of the total number of children in the given population attend summer camp while the rest (approximately 93.7%) remain at home.
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total and out of them, 629424 children go to school during summer vacations. So, the number of children who do not go to school is = Total number of children - Number of children who go to school = 898051 - 629424 = 268627. Therefore, 268627 children stay at home during summer vacations.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in total. Of these, 274865 children stay at home during Grishmakaliyan period and the remaining go to school. So, the number of children who go to school is:  Number of children going to school = Total number of children - Children staying at home During Grishmakaliyan period = 313473 - 274865 = 38909  Therefore, 38909 children go to school during Grishmakaliyan period.
Response:  We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation and 455682 children go to camp. So, the total number of children is: 907611 + 455682 = 1363293. Therefore, there are 1363293 children in Lorraine County.
"Response:  We know that there are 800059 children who attend the summer camp at Larens County and stay in the remaining houses. So, the number of children who stay in each house is:

Number of children per house = Total number of children / Number of houses
= 800059 / Unknown number of houses

Since we don't have the exact number of houses, let's assume it to be x. Then, we can calculate the number of children who stay in each house as follows:

Number of children per house = Total number of children / X
= 800059 / x

Now, we need to find out how many houses are left empty after all the children go to the summer camp. To do this, we subtract the total number of children who attend the summer camp from the total number of children:

Number of empty houses = Total number of children - Number of children attending summer camp
= 800059 - 828521
= -28467

So, there are -28467 houses left empty after all the children go to the summer camp."
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children who stayed at home during the summer vacation and did not go to camp. So, the number of children who went to camp is equal to the difference between the total number of children (91676) and the number of children who stayed at home (61619). Therefore, the number of children who went to camp is 30057.
Response:  We know that out of 444,444 children, 340,444 children attended the camp and 134,867 children stayed at home. So, the total number of children who participated in the camp is 340,444 + 134,867 = 475,311. Now, we are asked about the remaining 424944 children who came from outside. Therefore, the total number of children who attended the camp or were present at the camp location is 475,311 + 424944 = 899,755.
Response:  We know that out of 610769 children who attended the summer camp, 22 were from outside the county. So, the number of children from the county is 610547. Now, we need to find out how many children are in Lorraine County. The total number of children in Lorraine County is given as 590796. Therefore, the number of children from Lorraine County attending the summer camp is:  Number of children from Lorraine County = Total number of children - Number of children from outside the county = 590796 - 22 = 588574.
Response:  We know that out of 100 children, 644997 stayed at home and 893835 went to camp. So, the total number of children who did not go to camp is 644997 + 893835 = 1538232. Now, we are asked how many children were in Lorraine County. The answer is given as 78. Therefore, the number of children in Lorraine County is 78 / 1538232 = 0.0052.
Response:  Edam has 3 seeds more than Jackie. So, Edam has 9 seeds - 3 = 6 seeds. Therefore, Jackie has 6 seeds.
Response:  Jack has 2 seeds and Edam has 10 seeds. So, to find out how many more seeds Edam has than Jack, we need to subtract the number of seeds Jack has from the total number of seeds Edam has: 10 - 2 = 8 Therefore, Edam has 8 more seeds than Jack.
Response:  Edam has 9 seeds and Jackie has 10 seeds. So, if we want to find out how many seeds Jackie has of Edam, we need to subtract the number of seeds Edam has from the total number of seeds Jackie has. Therefore, the answer is: Jackie has 10 - 9 = 1 seed of Edam.
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and Edam has 8 apples. So, if we take away Edam's apples from Jack's total, then how many apples will be left with Jack?  Number of apples left with Jack = Total number of apples owned by Jack - Total number of apples owned by Edam  Number of apples owned by Jack = 10  Number of apples owned by Edam = 8  Therefore, the number of apples left with Jack is: 10 - 8 = 2  So, there are 2 apples left with Jack after taking away Edam's apples.
Response:  Edam and Jackie have 6 seeds between them. If they share equally, each will get 3 seeds. Now, Edam has 2 more seeds than Jackie, so Edam gets 3 + 2 = 5 seeds. Therefore, there are 5 seeds in total.
Response:  Edam and Jackie have together 9 seeds more than they have between them. So, the total number of seeds Edam and Jackie have is 9 + (Edam's seeds - Jackie's seeds) = 9 + 7 = 16 seeds. Therefore, there are 16 seeds in total.
Response:  Edam and Jackie have together 12 seeds. Edam has more than Jackie by 9 seeds. So, the difference between their number of seeds is 9. Therefore, the number of seeds that Edam has is 9 + 3 = 12.  Hence, there are 12 seeds in total.
Response:  Edam has more than 4 seeds and less than 10 seeds. Jackie has 10 seeds. Both have fewer than 2 seeds together. So, there are 8 seeds in total (4 + 4). Therefore, Edam has 4 seeds.
Response:  Jack has 89 sandals and 11 seeds. Edam has more than 5 seeds but less than 6 seeds. So, Edam has exactly 6 seeds. Therefore, Edam has 6 + 11 = 17 seeds in total.
Response:  Yesterday (December 31), Helen made preparations to receive New Year gifts at her home with her friends. According to the question, today morning (January 1) she had received 270 kukis and 419 parsoons. So, if we calculate the total number of kukis and parsoons that Helen received yesterday, it would be: Total number of kukis = 270 + 419 = 689 Total number of parsoons = 419 Therefore, last night (December 31), Helen received 689 kukis and parsoons.
Response:  Helena and her friends are preparing to give thanks for their home at Helen's house today morning. According to the passage, Helena made 90 chocolate chip cookies yesterday afternoon and 51 rice krispy treats this morning. Additionally, she has baked 484 chocolate chip cookies so far today. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helena has baked as follows: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = Number of cookies baked yesterday + Number of cookies baked today - Number of cookies already given away So, the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helena has baked is: Total number of chocolate chip cookies = 90 + 51 - 0 = 141 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  Helen made 527 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and gave away 86 of them. Today, she baked 86 rice krispy treats and 554 chocolate chip cookies. So, if we subtract the number of cookies she gave away from the total number of cookies she baked today, we get:  Number of chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen today = Total number of cookies baked today - Number of cookies given away today  Number of chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen today = 554 - 86 = 468 chocolate chip cookies. Therefore, Helen baked 468 chocolate chip cookies today.
Response:  On day 1 (yesterday), Helen made 144 chocolate chip cookies and 397 kishmish balls. Today morning, she baked 85 rice cakes and 403 chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen has made: 144 + 397 = 541 treats yesterday. And today, she has made: 85 + 403 = 488 treats today. Therefore, the total number of treats that Helen has made is: 541 + 488 = 1029 treats.
Response:  Helena had 19 chocolate chip cookies and 231 rice krispies treats yesterday (yesterday = 1 day ago). Today is Sunday (today = 0 days ago). So, she made 237 chocolate chip cookies today (today = 1 day ago). Now, let's calculate how many more chocolate chip cookies Helena made today compared to yesterday:  Number of chocolate chip cookies made today - Number of chocolate chip cookies made yesterday = 237 - 19 = 218 Therefore, Helena made 218 more chocolate chip cookies today than she did yesterday.
"Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 kishmish cookies. Today, she has baked 75 rice cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies. So, the difference between yesterday and today is:

Yesterday (y): 197 chocolate chip cookies + 46 kishmish cookies = 243 cookies
Today (t): 75 rice cookies + 66 chocolate chip cookies = 141 cookies

Therefore, the difference in number of cookies baked between yesterday and today is 243 - 141 = 102 cookies."
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 kishmish cookies. Today, she has baked 280 rice cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies. So, yesterday, Helen had more kishmish cookies than today. Therefore, the difference between the number of kishmish cookies baked by Helen yesterday and today is:  300 - 280 = 20.
"Response: 
Keti has 81 games and her friends have 59 games. So, Keti has more than 59 - 81 = 22 games than her friends. Therefore, Keti plays with 81 - 22 = 60 games more than her friends."
Response:  We know that Keti has 91 games and her new friends have 88 games. So, in total, Kiti's old friends have 53 games (91 - 88 = 53). Therefore, the total number of games among all three groups is: 53 + 88 + 91 = 232 games.
Response:  Kati has 78 new and 86 old games. Her friends have 48 new games. So, the total number of new games among all three is: 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
"Response: 
Keti has 84 new and 19 old games. Her friends have 8 new and 69 old games. So, in total, they have 84 + 19 = 103 games.
Therefore, the number of new games that Kiti and her friends have together is 103 - 8 = 95 games."
Response:  The total number of games that Katty had was 62 new and 80 old games.  Her friends had 73 new and 41 old games. So, the total number of old games among all of them is:  Old Games = Total Number of Games - New Games = 80 - 62 = 18.
Response:  We know that Keti has more games than her friends. So, let X be the number of games Keti has. Since Keti's friends have 57 games and she has more than them, we can say that X > 57. Also, since Keti's friends have 63 games in total, we can say that X + 57 = 63 (since Keti has more than her friends). Solving for X, we get X = 100. Therefore, Keti has 100 games.
"Response: 
Keti has more games than her friends. So, Keti has 57 new games and 39 old games, while her friends have 34 new games. To find out how many more games Keti has than her friends, we need to subtract the number of new games her friends have from the total number of new games Kiti has.
So, the difference between Kiti's new games and her friend's new games is:
57 - 34 = 23
Therefore, Kiti has 23 more games than her friends."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $60 last week and Jessie had $19 last week. Now, after one month, Jessie has earned $33 more than he had last week, so his current amount is $52 ($19 + $33). Since Jessie spent $40 on cars during this period, he gained $12 ($52 - $40) from selling cars. So, Jessie made $12 in profit from selling cars during this period.
Response:  Fred had $86 last week and spent $13 on cars. Now he has $73. Jason had $5 last week and didn't do any work this week, so he still has $5. So, the total amount of money they have now is: $73 + $5 = $78.
Response:  Fred had $19 last week and spent $8 this week, so he has $11 left ($19 - $8 = $11).  Jessie had $16 last week and spent $5 this week, so she has $11 left ($16 - $5 = $11).  Now, let's find out how much money each of them made during the week.  For Fred, he made $11 - $8 = $3 more than last week. So, his profit is $3.  For Jessie, she made $11 - $5 = $6 more than last week. So, her profit is $6.
Response:  Fred had $114 last week and spent $30 on something. Now he has $84. Jessie had $22 last week and spent $15 on something. Now she has $67. So, in total, Jessie made $67 - $15 = $52 during the week.
Response:  Fred had $111 last week and spent $30 on car maintenance. Now he has $115. Jesson had $40 last week and spent $20 on groceries. Now he has $44. So, in total, they made $79 ($115 - $30 + $44).
Response:  Fred had $49 last week and spent $15 on cars. Now he has $112. Jesson had $3 and now has $63. So, Fred made $79 more than Jesson. Therefore, the answer is (D) $79.
Response:  Fred had $78 last week and spent $25 on cars. Now he has $90. So, his spending was $90 - $78 = $12.  Jesson had $31 last week and spent $14 on cars. Now he has $31 - $14 = $17. So, Jesson made $17 in profit from selling cars during the past week.
Response:  In the previous week, Fred had $33 and Jessie had $95. During that week, Fred earned $16 in income and spent $74 on cars. So, Fred's balance at the end of the week was: $33 + ($16 x 1) - $74 = $28.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $47 in his account last week and earned $111 during that week. So, his new balance is: $47 + $111 = $158. Now, he spent $34 on cars, so his remaining balance is: $158 - $34 = $124. Therefore, Fred has $124 in his account now.
"Response:  Jessie had a weight of 71 kilograms before she started jogging regularly. If she reduced her weight by 20 kilograms after starting to jog, then her current weight is:

Current weight = Original weight - Reduction in weight
= 71 kg - 20 kg
= 51 kg

Therefore, Jessie's current weight is 51 kilograms."
Response:  Jessie had a weight of 27 kilograms before jogging. If she reduced her weight by 101 kilograms after jogging, then her initial weight must have been greater than 101 kilograms. So, Jessie's initial weight was 27 + x kilograms, where x is a positive integer. Now, we are given that Jessie started jogging 5 days ago. Therefore, the time taken by Jessie to reduce her weight by 101 kilograms is equal to the number of days since she started jogging. In other words, x = 5. Substituting this value in the equation above, we get: 27 + x = 371  Solving for x, we get: x = 400 kg Initially, Jessie weighed 400 kilograms.
"Response:  We know that Jesi lost 126 kilograms after starting jogging. So her weight before starting jogging was: 

Weight before starting jogging = Current weight - Lost weight = 66 kg - 126 kg = -60 kg

Therefore, Jesi's weight before starting jogging was -60 kg."
"Response:  We know that Jessie reduced her weight from 69 kilograms to 35 kilograms in 10 weeks. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Weight before = 69 kg
Weight after = 35 kg
Time taken = 10 weeks

Now, let's convert the given information into a numerical value using the formula for calculating weight loss per week:

Weight loss (per week) = (weight after - weight before) / time taken
= (35 kg - 69 kg) / 10 weeks
= -0.35 kg/week

So, Jessie lost approximately 0.35 kilograms per week during the 10-week period."
Response:  At first, Jesi had a weight of 114 kilograms. After she started jogging regularly, her weight reduced by 50 kilograms in the first week and then further reduced by another 60 kilograms in the next week. So, after two weeks, Jesi's weight would be: 114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg + (60 kg / 2) = 78 kg Therefore, Jesi's current weight is approximately 78 kilograms.
Response:  The weight of Jessie before jogging was 9 kilograms. After one week of jogging (7 days), her weight decreased to 62 kilograms. Then she stopped jogging for another week and gained weight back to 140 kilograms. So, the weight of Jessie before starting jogging was:  Weight before jogging = 9 kg + (62 kg - 9 kg) / 7 days = 9 kg + 53 kg / 7 = 62 kg
Response:  In the first week of jogging, Jesy lost 56 kilograms and in the second week, she lost 99 kilograms. So, after the first week of jogging, Jesy had lost a total of 56 + 99 = 155 kilograms.
Response:  If there were 95 saanp and 61 magar machch in one pinnacle, then if 64 saanp had been hidden, how many would not have been hidden? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of saanp that were hidden (64) from the total number of saanp (95). So, the answer is 31 saanp did not get hidden.
Response:  We know that in total, there were 93 saanp and 97 magarmachch in one pinnacle of Chidiya Ghar. If 40 magarmachch had been hidden, then how many would not have been hidden? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of hidden magarmachch (40) from the total number of magarmachch (97). So, the answer is 57 magarmachch did not hide themselves.
Response:  We know that in the initial piggy bank, there were 3 saamps and 75 magar machch. If we add 82 more saamps and 19 more magar machch, then the total number of magar machch would be:  Total magar machch = 75 + (82 x 1) = 75 + 82 = 157 Therefore, 46 magar machch did not fit inside the piggy bank.
Response:  We know that in total there were 79 animals inside the cage. If 24 saamps and 51 magarmachchs were hidden inside the cage, then we can conclude that no animals were hiding inside the cage. So, the correct answer is (D) None of them.
Response:  On day 1 (yesterday), he had 171 tomatoes and gave away 134 tomatoes. So, he has 37 tomatoes left today.
Response:  On day 1 (yesterday), the farmer had 160 tomatoes in his bag.  On day 2 (today), he had 56 + 41 = 97 tomatoes in his bag. So, the number of tomatoes the farmer dropped from his bag between yesterday and today is 97 - 160 = -63 tomatoes.
Response:  On day 1 (yesterday), the farmer had 90 tomatoes in his bag. If he picked 60 tomatoes today (today), then he has 90 - 60 = 30 tomatoes left in his bag now. So, the total number of tomatoes the farmer picked is 30 + 90 = 120 tomatoes.
Response:  If the farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his bag initially, then he picked up 172 potatoes. So, now he has 175 - 172 = 3 tomatoes less than what he originally had. Similarly, he has 77 - 72 = 5 potatoes less than what he originally had. Therefore, the number of tomatoes left with him is 3, and the number of potatoes left with him is 5.
Response:  The farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his bag initially. If he took out 53 tomatoes, then the number of tomatoes left with him is:  177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes. Similarly, if he took out 53 tomatoes, then the number of potatoes left with him is:  12 - 0 = 12 potatoes. Therefore, there are 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left with the farmer after taking out 53 tomatoes from his bag.
Response:  We know that initially there were 105 tomatoes and 71 potatoes in the farmer's bag. If he had added 137 more tomatoes, then the total number of tomatoes would be: 105 + 137 = 242 tomatoes. Now, let's find out how many potatoes are left after adding 137 more tomatoes: 71 + (137 - 71) = 71 + 66 = 137 potatoes. So, there are 137 potatoes left in the farmer's bag after adding 137 more tomatoes.
Response:  If each plank of wood requires 2 nails to secure it, and there are 4 planks in total, then we need 8 nails (2 x 4 = 8) to secure all the planks.  Now, if we want to make sure that each nail is placed in such a way that no single nail is responsible for securing more than one plank, then we will need an additional 2 nails (for a total of 10 nails). So, the final answer is 10 nails needed to secure the wooden planks for the wall of a house.
"Response:  We know that John wants to make 17 wooden brackets for each of the 4 walls of his house (wall length x number of brackets = total length of bracket required). Since each bracket requires 8 kilos of wood, we need a total of:

17 x 4 = 68 brackets

So, John needs 68 x 8 = 528 kilograms of wood for all the brackets."
Response:  We know that John needs to cut 11 boards of wood for his home wall and each board requires 3 pieces of plywood. So, he needs a total of 33 pieces of plywood (11 x 3 = 33). However, out of these, 8 pieces are already used up in cutting the first 11 boards, leaving him with 25 pieces of plywood remaining (33 - 8 = 25).
"Response:  John has used 20 large and 10 small nails for building walls of his house. If he wants to keep them secure with 15 pieces of wood (kiols) for each big nail and 5 pieces of wood for each small nail, then he will need a total of:

Big nails: 20 x 15 = 300 kiols
Small nails: 10 x 5 = 50 kiols
Total number of kiols needed = 300 + 50 = 350 kiols
Therefore, John needs 350 kiols to secure the nails in his house walls."
Response:  We know that John wants to use 16 tiles to cover his wall and each tile requires two kilos of cement for its construction. So, we need 16 x 2 = 32 kilograms of cement to cover the entire wall with tiles.
Response:  We are given that there are 74 tukdes of kiwi fruit required to secure each of the seven walls of the house. Since there are seven walls in total, we need 7 x 74 = 508 tukdes of kiwi fruit to secure all the walls of the house. Therefore, John needs 508 tukdes of kiwi fruit to build the wall for his home.
"Response:  John needs to make 14 big doors and 25 small doors. Each big door requires 10 boards, and each small door requires 3 boards. So, in total, John needs:

Big doors: 14 x 10 = 140 boards
Small doors: 25 x 3 = 75 boards
Total number of boards needed = 140 + 75 = 215 boards."
Response:  We know that there are 42 packets of gum in total and each packet contains 3 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packets = Total number of pieces / Number of pieces per packet. In this case, the total number of pieces is 42 (since there are 42 packets), and the number of pieces per packet is 3 (since each packet contains 3 pieces). Now, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the number of packets: Number of packets = 42 / 3 = 14 packets Therefore, there are 14 packets of gum in Robin's bag.
Response:  We know that there are 43 packets of chocolates in total and each packet contains 23 pieces of chocolate. So, the total number of chocolates = Number of packets x Number of pieces per packet = 43 x 23 = 1005 chocolates. Now, we have to find out how many extra chocolates Robbin has. The given information is - There are 8 additional chocolates with Robbin. So, the total number of chocolates with Robbin = Total number of chocolates - Extra chocolates = 1005 - 8 = 997 chocolates. Therefore, Robbin has 997 chocolates.
Response:  We know that there are 7 tukdes in each packet and Robbin has 6 additional chammachs. So, total number of packets = Total number of tukdes / Number of tukdes per packet = 41 tukdes / 7 tukdes/packet = 5.85 packers (approximately). Therefore, Robbin has approximately 5 packers.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 4 pieces of chocolate. So, the total number of chocolates = Number of packets x Number of pieces in each packet = 28 x 4 = 112. Therefore, there are 112 chocolates in Robin's bag.
"Response:  We know that there are 21 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 9 pieces. So, the total number of chocolate pieces in all packets is:

21 packets x 9 pieces/packet = 189 pieces of chocolate
Now, we also know that there are 45 candies in all packets. Since each packet has 9 pieces of chocolate, the total number of candies in all packets is:

45 packets x 9 pieces/packet = 375 pieces of candy
So, there are 189 + 375 = 564 pieces of chocolate and candy in total."
Response:  We know that there are 28 packets of chocolates and each packet contains 6 pieces of chocolate. So, in total, Robbin has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of chocolate.
"Response:  The machine can make 3 shirts in one minute. So, it will take 3 minutes to make 1 shirt. Therefore, the total time taken by the machine to make all 6 shirts is:
Time taken = Number of shirts x Time per shirt
= 6 x 3
= 18 minutes
Therefore, the machine worked for 18 minutes non-stop to produce 6 shirts."
Response:  The machine can make 5 shirts in 1 minute. So, it makes one shirt every 60 seconds (1 minute / 60 seconds = 1/60). Now, we need to find out how many shirts the machine can make in 5 minutes. We know that there are 300 seconds in 5 minutes (5 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds), so the machine can make 300/60 = 5 shirts in 5 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 5 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in an hour, and today it made 44 shirts in an hour. So, the rate at which the machine makes shirts has increased by 5 times.  Now, if the machine can make 3 shirts in one minute, then in how many minutes will it make 44 shirts?  We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to divide the number of shirts by the number of minutes: 44 shirts / 60 minutes = 720 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 720 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in one minute. Today, it made 3 shirts in one minute. To find out how many minutes the machine worked overall, we can use the formula: Total time = (Number of shirts produced today x Number of shirts produced yesterday) / 8 The total number of shirts produced is 13 + 3 = 16. So, if the machine produces 8 shirts per minute, then the total time taken to make all these shirts would be: Total time = (16 x 8) / 8 = 128 minutes Therefore, the machine worked for 128 minutes in total.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in an hour, so it made 9 x 60 = 540 shirts in total yesterday. Today, it made 8 shirts in an hour, so it made 8 x 60 = 480 shirts today. In one minute, the machine can make 2 shirts, as per the question. So, in total, the machine worked for (540 + 480) minutes = 1020 minutes today.
Response:  On Monday, the machine made 4 shirts in 1 minute, so it produced 4 x 60 = 240 shirts in total that day.  Yesterday, the machine made 8 shirts in 1 minute, so it produced 8 x 60 = 480 shirts in total yesterday.  In total, the machine has produced 240 + 480 = 720 shirts in 2 days. So, the machine produces 720 / 2 = 360 shirts per minute.
Response:  On Monday (yesterday), the machine made 6 shirts in 1 minute, so it produced 6 x 1 = 6 shirts. Today, it made 14 shirts in 14 minutes, so it produced 14 x 1 = 14 shirts. Therefore, the total number of shirts produced by the machine is 6 + 14 = 20 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 5 shirts in 5 minutes, so it produced 1 shirt per minute. Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and made 12 x 1 = 12 shirts. Therefore, the number of shirts made by the machine today is 12.
Response:  If they made $165 in total over 5 days, and they worked only one job per day, then we can calculate their daily income as follows: Daily Income = Total Income / Number of Days Worked = $165 / 5 = $33 per day So, they made $33 per day on average.
Response:  The ring tos game made $144 per day for 22 days in the carnival. So, total amount earned = Total number of days x Amount earned per day = 22 x $144 = $3088.
Response:  We know that in one day, they made $100. So, after 30 days, they have made $3000 ($100 x 30). Now, let's calculate how much Ring Toss game has earned per day. As we know that out of $3000, $22 was earned through Ring Toss game, so the amount earned per day through Ring Toss game is $22 / 30 = $7.67. Therefore, the answer is $7.67.
Response:  The game made $382 in 44 days and then made $374 in the next 10 days. So, the total amount of money made by the game is : $382 + $374 = $756. Therefore, the total amount of money made by the game is $756.
Response:  The person made $120 in the first 20 days and $66 in the next 16 days, for a total of $186. So, they made $186 / 46 = $4.07 per day on average during those 46 days.
Response:  The total number of days in the period is 154 days. In the first 154 days, they earned $325 and in the last 57 days, they earned $114. So, their average earnings per day during the entire period are: $$ \frac {325}{154} = 2.09$ dollars per day $$ Now, let's calculate their average earnings per day for the last 57 days only: $$ \frac {114}{57} = 2.00$$ dollars per day Therefore, the answer to your question is $2.09$ dollars per day.
Response:  Lucia bought 10 packets of kukri and 4 packets of keeki. We know that each packet of kukri contains 5 pieces, so she bought 50 pieces of kukri (10 packets x 5 pieces/packet). Similarly, we know that each packet of keeki contains 3 pieces, so she bought 12 pieces of keeki (4 packets x 3 pieces/packet). Therefore, the total number of pieces of kukri and keeki that Lucia bought is 50 + 12 = 62 pieces.
Response:  Lucia bought 4 packets of kukish (worth Rs. 22 each), 22 packets of chocolates (worth Rs. 50 each), and 16 packets of cookies (worth Rs. 30 each). So, she spent a total amount of: 4 x Rs. 22 = Rs. 88 + 22 x Rs. 50 = Rs. 1100 + 16 x Rs. 30 = Rs. 480 = Rs. 1668 Total number of packets purchased = 4 + 22 + 16 = 42 packets.
Response:  Lucia bought 23 packets of kerosene and some packets of Keck. In total, she had 27 packets of kerosene in her possession before buying any Keck. So, she bought x packets of Keck. Since each packet of Keck contains 5 liters, Lucia bought 5x liters of Keck. Therefore, the answer is 5x.
Response:  Lucia bought 2 packets of kukri and 12 packets of keekar at the shop. In total, she spent Rs 56. So, she bought how many packets in all?  We can start by finding out how much Lucia paid for each packet of kukri and keekar. From the question, we know that the price of one packet of kukri is Rs 30 and the price of one packet of keekar is Rs 40. Therefore, Lucia paid a total of:  For kukri: = x x 30 = 600 For keekar: = x x 40 = 480 Total amount paid by Lucia = 600 + 480 = 1080 Now, let's find out how many packets Lucia bought. We are given that Lucia spent Rs 56 in total. So, the number of packets Lucia bought is: Number of packets = Amount spent / Price per packet = 56 / (30 or 40) = 19 or 16 Since Lucia bought either 19 or 16 packets, we cannot determine the exact number without more information. However, based on the options provided in the question, we can conclude that Lucia bought either 19 or 16 packets of kukri and keekar.
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. When 4 more people got on the next stop, the total number of people in the bus became 12 + 4 = 16. Now, each person can accommodate at most 36 people, so the maximum capacity of the bus is 16 x 36 = 576. Therefore, there are 576 people in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus and joined them. So, the total number of people in the bus now is 8 + 12 = 20. Finally, 3 people left the bus, so the remaining number of people in the bus is 20 - 3 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 people in the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 3 more people got in. So, now there are 7 people in the bus (4 + 3 = 7).
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train. Then, 8 more people got into the train. So, now there are 11 + 8 = 19 people in the train.
Response:  We know that there were 22 fathers and 22 mothers in total, so their combined number is 44 (22 + 22). Now, we need to add the number of children they had together, which is given as 676. Therefore, the total number of people involved in the activity is: 44 + 676 = 718. So, there were 718 students upstairs.
Response:  We are given that there were 73 abhivyakti (participants), 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. So, we need to find out how many people were present in total. To do this, we can add the number of participants, students, and teachers together:  Total = Participants + Students + Teachers = 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 Now, we have found the total number of people who were present in the program.
Response:  According to the given information, there were 174 mothers and fathers in the program, and 521 students participated in it. So, we need to find out how many more students than mothers and fathers participated in the program. To do this, we can subtract the number of mothers and fathers from the total number of participants: Number of students = Total participants - Mothers + Fathers = 521 - 174 + 174 = 371 Therefore, there were 371 more students than mothers and fathers who participated in the program.
Response:  We know that there were 61 mothers and fathers in the program, and 177 students participated in it. So, the total number of people who attended the event was: 61 + 177 = 238. Therefore, 238 people attended the program.
Response:  We know that Gupha is 919 feet deep and needs to travel 1307 feet away from it. So, we need to find out how many feet are left after traveling 1307 feet away from Gupha. To do this, we will divide 1307 by 919, which gives us approximately 1.425. Therefore, Gupha's end is approximately 1425 feet away from its starting point.
Response:  Gupha is 1218 feet deep and it was initially 849 feet deep. If they are moving at a speed of 17 miles per hour, how far will they have traveled after reaching the bottom of the pit? We know that distance = speed x time. So if they travel for t hours at a speed of s miles per hour, their distance traveled can be calculated as follows: Distance = Speed x Time = 17 miles/hour x t hours = 1218 - 849 = 369 miles. Therefore, to reach the end of the pit from where they started, they would need to cover a distance of approximately 369 miles.
Response:  If they were already at an altitude of 659 feet and reached a depth of 762 feet, then the distance traveled downward is: Distance = Depth - Initial Altitude = 762 - 659 = 83 feet.
Response:  We know that initially there were 8 sunhari mushrooms in the jar (Page started with 8 sunhari mushrooms). Now, we are asked how many sunhari mushrooms remained after Bilbo ate 6 of them. To find out, we need to subtract the number of mushrooms Bilbo ate from the initial total. So, the answer is: 6 - 6 = 0 sunhari mushrooms remaining in the jar after Bilbo ate them.
"Response:  We know that initially there were 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in the pond. Now, we are told that 15 baby fish have hatched from the eggs laid by the mother catfish. So, the total number of fish in the pond now is:

7 + 12 + 15 = 34

Therefore, 18 fish (7 goldfish + 12 catfish + 15 baby fish) are present in the pond now."
Response:  We know that Paige has 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in her pond. Now, she wants to feed them both equally. So, we need to divide the total number of fish (16 + 71 = 87) by 2 to find out how many sundry foods each type of fish can have. Therefore, the number of sundry foods for each goldfish is 87/16 = 5.5 and for each catfish it is 87/71 = 1.23. Since we cannot have decimal numbers of food, round off these values to the nearest whole number. So, Paige will give 6 sundry foods to each goldfish and 4 to each catfish. As a result, 24 sundry foods will be gone.
"Response:  We know that 15 small fish were caught in the net and put into the bucket. Out of them, 5 goldfish escaped. So, the number of goldfish that did not escape is:

$$ \boxed{5} $$"
Response:  Initially, he had 43 seeds in his possession. After planting some of them and harvesting others, he had 2 seeds left. So, he used 41 seeds for planting (43 - 2 = 41).
"Response:  Initially, there were 58 seeds in total. After some of them were planted and grew into plants, the number of seeds reduced to 35. So, the number of seeds that did not get planted or did not grow is:

58 - 35 = 23

Therefore, 23 seeds remained unplanted or did not grow."
Response:  Initially, the shepherd had 40 seeds and 54 apples. After some time, he had 39 remaining apples. So, the number of apples used = Number of apples remaining - Initial number of apples = 54 - 40 = 14. Therefore, the shepherd used 14 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 questions in each room and we have 4 large rooms and 4 small rooms. So, the total number of questions in all the rooms is:

Large Rooms: 4 x 11 = 44 questions
Small Rooms: 4 x 5 = 20 questions
Total Number of Questions: 44 + 20 = 64 questions
Therefore, there can be up to 64 questions in Edam's rooms."
Response:  We know that there are 10 boxes in each room and we have to fit them into the rooms such that no box overlaps with any other box. So, for one room, we can place 8 boxes, which means 2 boxes will be left unused (since 8 is less than 10). Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes that can fit in both rooms together: Total number of boxes = Number of boxes in first room + Number of boxes in second room - Number of boxes that cannot be placed in either room (i.e., 2) Total number of boxes = 8 + 6 - 2 = 16 Therefore, there were 16 almonds in the two rooms combined.
Response:  We have to find out how many vases can fit in each shelf and then calculate the total number of vases that can fit in all four shelves.  Each shelf has space for 8 figurines and 10 almaries, so we can fit 8 x 10 = 80 figurines per shelf. Since there are 4 shelves, we can fit 4 x 80 = 320 figurines altogether. Now, let's consider the almaries. Each almari has space for 5 vases, so we can fit 5 x 4 = 20 vases in each of the 4 almaries. Therefore, the total number of vases that can fit in all 4 almaries is 20 x 4 = 80 vases. So, the total number of vases that can fit in the room is 320 + 80 = 400 vases.
Response:  We know that there are 544 bags of rice. Each bag contains 32 flowers. So, in total, we have 544 x 32 = 17608 flowers. Therefore, the answer is 17608.
Response:  We know that there are 466 bartans in total. Each bartan has 53 flowers and 181 chhadees. So, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total no. of flowers = Number of bartans x No. of flowers per bartan = 466 x 53 = 24980 flowers Now, let's calculate the total number of chhadees: Total no. of chhadees = Number of bartans x No. of chhadees per bartan = 466 x 181 = 87660 chhadees Therefore, the total number of flowers and chhadees are 24980 + 87660 = 112640.
Response:  We have 141 bartans in total. Each bartan has 71 flowers and 91 chhadees. So, the total number of flowers is = 71 x 141 = 9561 flowers. Therefore, there are 9561 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in each pot and we have 10 pots. So, the total number of flowers is 40 x 10 = 400. Therefore, there are 400 pots.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 skittles in the bowl and 4276 rabbits in the area around the bowl. If we divide both quantities equally among 154 groups (or ""sampooh""), then each group will contain:

Number of Skittles per Group = Total number of Skittles / Number of Groups = 4502 / 154 = 29

Similarly, the number of rabbits per group can be calculated as follows:

Number of Rabbits per Group = Total number of Rabbits / Number of Groups = 4276 / 154 = 28

So, each group contains approximately 29 skittles and 28 rabbits."
Response:  We know that there are 3941 scooters in Steve's collection and 4950 rubber bands are available. If we divide the number of scooters by the number of rubber bands, we get: Number of rubber bands per scooter = 4950 / 3941 = 12.16 rubber bands per scooter Now, let's assume that each group of 495 scooters has an equal number of rubber bands. Therefore, the number of rubber bands for each group of 495 scooters is: Number of rubber bands for each group of 495 sccooters = 12.16 x 495 = 6078 rubber bands So, if there are 4950 rubber bands available and 495 scooters are grouped together, then each group of 495 scooters will have approximately 6078 rubber bands.
"Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in total and they are divided into 8 groups of equal size. Since we have 517 red ones and 90 purple ones, each group must contain at least these many skittles. So, the minimum number of skittles in each group is:

$$ \text{Minimum number of skittles in each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of skittles}}{\text{Number of groups}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Minimum number of skittles in each group} &= \frac{896}{8} \\ &= 112 \end{aligned} $$

So, each group contains at least $112$ skittles."
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each class has 5 students. So, we have: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class = 270 / 5 = 54 classes Now, since all classes have equal number of students, we can say that the total number of graduates is also equal for all classes. Therefore, the total number of graduates is: Total number of graduates = Number of classes x Number of graduates per class = 54 x 5 = 270 graduates Hence, there are 270 graduates in total.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes in total and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class Total number of students = 304 x 75 Total number of students = 22,550 Now, we have to find out how many students were there in the school. Therefore, we divide the total number of students by 100, since there are 100 students in one class. Total number of students / 100 = 22,550 / 100 Total number of students = 225 students.
