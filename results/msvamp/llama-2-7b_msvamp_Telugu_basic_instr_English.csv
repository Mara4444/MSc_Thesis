"Response: 572
Explanation:
The number of pallets required to transport 601 boxes with each box weighing 10 kg is calculated as follows:

Number of pallets = Number of boxes / Load per pallet
= 601 / 10
= 60

Since there are 406 erythrocytes in one liter of blood, and each liter of blood can be packed into 336 bags, the total number of bags required to transport 336 liters of blood is calculated as follows:

Total number of bags = Number of liters / Bag capacity
= 336 / 1 liter
= 336

Therefore, the answer is 572 (601 - 336)."

To find the difference between the amounts at different ages, we need to subtract the amount at one age from the amount at another age. For example, to find the difference between $ 21 and $ 702, we subtract $ 702 from $ 21, which gives us $ 690. Therefore, the answer is 35498 (i.e., $ 690 x 50)."

"Response:  $104$

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

Total number of jerseys = 35 x 2 = 70
Number of jerseys in each box = 69
Therefore, the total number of boxes required to pack all the jerseys is:
$$ \frac{ Total\ number\ of\ jerseys }{ Number\ of\ jerseys\ in\ each\ box } = \frac{70}{69} = 104 $$
So, we need $104$ boxes to pack all the $70$ jerseys."

"Response: 103
Explanation:
The number of triangles that can be formed by connecting 175 dots in a grid with 77 rows and columns is 103. To see why, imagine dividing each row into three sections, and then drawing a line from one dot to another in each section. There will be 77 x 3 = 231 lines drawn in this way, which means there are 231 triangles possible. However, some of these triangles may overlap or have duplicate points, so the actual number of unique triangles is smaller - in this case, it's 103."
