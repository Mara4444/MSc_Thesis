Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total area of the park as follows:
Area of park = Area of ellipse + Area of rectangle
= (π x radius^2) + (l x w)

where l and w are the lengths of the semi-major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively.

The radius of the ellipse is half the length of the major axis, which is 7 taulas. Therefore, the radius is 3.5 taulas.

Now, we need to find the length of the semi-major axis, which is twice the radius. So, the length of the major axis is:
L = 2 x radius = 2 x 3.5 = 7 taulas

Similarly, the length of the minor axis is half the length of the major axis, so it is:
w = L/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 taulas

Now, we can calculate the area of the ellipse using the formula:
Area of ellipse = (π x radius^2)
= (π x (3.5)^2)
= 12.25 taula^2

Next, we need to find the area of the rectangle that forms the remaining part of the park. The dimensions of the rectangle are:
Length = 5 taulas
Width = 4 taulas
So, the area of the rectangle is:
Area of rectangle = length x width = 5 x 4 = 20 taula^2

Finally, we add the areas of both the ellipse and the rectangle to get the total area of the park:
Total area of park = Area of ellipse + Area of rectangle
= 12.25 taula^2 + 20 taula^2
= 32.25 taula^2

Therefore, the total area of the park is 32.25 taula^2.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total weight of books in Jeremy's room as follows:
Total weight of books = 5 tonnes x 1000 kg/tonne = 5000 kg
Now, there are 7 shelves in Jeremy's room, and each shelf can hold 300 kg of books. Therefore, the total weight of books that can be placed on each shelf is:
Total weight of books per shelf = 7 shelves x 300 kg/shelf = 2100 kg
So, the total number of books that can be placed on each shelf is:
Total number of books per shelf = Total weight of books per shelf / Weight of one book = 2100 kg / 500 g (weight of one book) = 4200 books
Since there are 9 textbooks, the total number of books that can be placed on each shelf is:
Total number of books per shelf x Number of textbooks = 4200 books x 9 = 36,800 books
Therefore, the total number of books that can fit on all 7 shelves in Jeremy's room is:
Total number of books = 36,800 books / 7 shelves = 5200 books
So, the answer to the question is 5200 books.";;;;;;;

Therefore, the total number of inches in the tape measure is 21 x 25 = 525 inches. Now, we need to find out how many inches are left after cutting off 16 inches from the end of the tape measure. To do this, we can divide the remaining length (525 - 16 = 499) by the distance between each mark (1 inch), which gives us 499 / 1 = 499 inches. So, there are 499 inches left after cutting off 16 inches from the end of the tape measure.";;;;;;;

The given information can be summarized as follows:
* The number of trees in the forest is 190.
* Each tree has 50 branches.
* Each branch has 3 leaves.

Total number of pigeon families = 27 x 26 = 692
Now, let's find out how many pigeon families are within a distance of 41 trees from each other:
Number of pigeon families within distance of 41 trees = Total number of pigeon families - Number of pigeon families within distance of 27 trees
= 692 - (692 / 27) = 35
Therefore, there are 35 pigeon families within a distance of 41 trees from each other in the mountain range.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
The given information can be interpreted as follows:
* The population of pheasants in a particular area is 86 tonnes.
* Out of these, 45 tonnes are males and 41 tones are females.
* Each male pheasant has an average of 3.5 chicks per year, while each female pheasant has an average of 2.7 chicks per year.
* The survival rate of chicks is 50%.
Now, to calculate the total number of pheasants after one year, we need to consider both the births and deaths.
Births:
Males: 45 x 3.5 = 157.5 chicks
Females: 41 x 2.7 = 111.7 chicks
Total births: 157.5 + 111.7 = 269.2 chicks
Deaths:
Males: 45 x 0.5 = 22.5 chicks (since only 50% survive)
Females: 41 x 0.5 = 20.5 chicks (since only 50% survive)
Total deaths: 22.5 + 20.5 = 43 chicks
So, the total number of pheasants after one year will be:
Total born: 269.2 - Total died: 43 = 226.2 pheasants
Therefore, the answer is 120.";;;;;;;

Since there are 308 friends, the total number of pensils required to give one penil to each friend is:
Total number of pensils required = Number of friends x Number of pensils in each box
= 308 friends x 10 pensils per box
= 3080 pensils
Therefore, the answer is 308.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
The question is asking for the number of years that will pass between the current year (1945) and the time when the speaker's son will be 52 years old. The speaker's son was born in 1938, so he will be 52 years old in 1990. Therefore, the difference between the current year and the year when the speaker's son will be 52 years old is 52 - 1945 = -1993. Since negative numbers are not possible, the answer must be 0 or a positive integer. In this case, the answer is 320 since it takes approximately 320 years for a person to reach the age of 52 starting from birth.";;;;;;;

The distance between station 7 and station 9 is 4 km. The distance between station 9 and the starting point (station 1) is 3 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Jack is 4 + 3 = 7 km.";;;;;;;
"Response: 20
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of steps required to reach the station from home as follows:
Station distance = 7 km - 8 km = -1 km (since negative distances are not possible)
Journey time = 8 km / 30 km/h = 0.267 hours (or 16 minutes and 40 seconds)
Since the train starts at 8 am, we need to add the journey time to get the arrival time at the station: Arrival time = 8 am + 0.267 hours = 8:26 am
Now, we know that Jack has to be at the station by 8:30 am, so he needs to leave his house at the latest by: Latest departure time = 8:30 am - 8:26 am = 4 minutes
Therefore, Jack needs to take 4 steps to reach the station.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
The distance between station San 5 and the base camp is 18 km. The base camp is located at an altitude of 3600 m above sea level. To calculate the height of Jack's position, we need to subtract the altitude of the base camp from his position. Therefore, Jack's position is at an altitude of 2740 m (3600 - 180) above sea level.";;;;;;;
"Response: 30
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total area of the station as follows:
Station area = 16 km x 8 km = 128 km²
Now, let's find out how much area is left after subtracting the station area from the total area of the district:
Total area of the district - Station area = 150 km² - 128 km² = 22 km²
So, there are 22 km² of land left in the district after subtracting the area of the station.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of apples and oranges as follows:
Apples = 12 x 100 = 1200
Oranges = 79 x 100 = 7900
So, there are 35 units (1200 + 7900) of fruit in the store.";;;;;;;
Response: 5 seeds are required to plant 3 basil plants in a 3x2 square foot garden with 9 rows and 8 columns each. So Jack needs 5 seeds to plant all 3 basil plants.;;;;;;;
"Response: 20
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the number of seeds in each basil plant as follows:
Number of seeds per basil plant = Number of basil plants / Total number of seeds
= 8 basil plants / 34 seeds (from 6 jackfruits)
= 2.35 basil plants per seed
Since there are 17 tamarinds and 16 seeds in one basil plant, we can calculate the number of tamarind seeds required to fill one basil plant as follows:
Number of tamarind seeds required for one basil plant = Number of tamarind seeds / Number of seeds per basil plant
= 16 seeds / 2.35 basil plants per seed
= 7.09 tamarind seeds per basil plant
Therefore, if 8 basil plants require 20 seeds, then 1 basil plant requires 7.09 tamarind seeds.";;;;;;;
"Response: 30
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the number of seeds in Jack's station as follows:
Number of seeds = Total number of seeds / Number of basins
= 300 seeds / 10 basins
= 30 seeds per basin
Now, from the second part of the question, we know that there are 12 tomatoes and 15 beets in each basin. So, the total number of seeds in Jack's station is:
Total number of seeds = Number of tomato plants x Number of seeds per tomato plant + Number of beet plants x Number of seeds per beet plant
= 12 x 30 + 15 x?
Substituting the values, we get:
Total number of seeds = 12 x 30 + 15 x?
= 480 + 225
= 705 seeds
Therefore, the answer to the question is 705.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of apples and seeds as follows:
Apples = 84 tons x 10 kg/ton = 840 kg
Seeds = 10 tons x 500 g/ton = 5000 kg
Now, we need to find out how many apples are required to produce 10 tons of seeds. We know that 1 ton of seeds produces 50 kg of apples, so:
Number of apples = Seeds / (50 kg/ton) = 5000 kg / 50 kg/ton = 100 tons
Therefore, Jack has 40 tons of apples left after giving away 64 tons.";;;;;;;

Since Becker wants to sell at least 153 posts per day, we need to subtract this number from the total number of posts available for sale:
Number of posts left for sale = Total number of posts - Minimum required sales per day

"Response: 74000
Explanation:
The question asks about the number of days it takes for 74 tons of wheat to be prepared for sowing after being threshed. To find this number, we need to divide the total quantity of wheat (74 tons) by the weight of one bag of wheat (50 kg). This gives us an average weight per day of 1460 kg/day. Then, we multiply this number by the number of days required for preparation (51 days), which gives us a total weight of wheat prepared for sowing of 74000 kg.";;;;;;;
"Response: 120
Explanation:
The question states that there are 76 borewells and each one requires 50 buckets of water per day. Therefore, the total number of buckets required daily is 76 x 50 = 3800 buckets. However, since some wells may not be in use due to various reasons, let's assume that only 64 wells are actually in use every day. So, the number of buckets available for irrigation is 64 x 50 = 3200 buckets. Since each well provides 250 buckets of water per day, the total number of wells that can provide water for irrigation is 3200 / 250 = 120 wells.";;;;;;;

"Response: 4567
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total income of Louis for each week as follows:
Weekly Income = Daily Income x Number of Weeks
Daily Income = Monthly Income / Number of Days in a Week
Monthly Income = $28 x 4 weeks = $112
Number of Days in a Week = 7 days
Therefore, the weekly income of Louis is:
Weekly Income = $112 / 7 days = $16 per day
Now, let's find out how much money Louis makes during the rainy season:
Rainy Season Income = Total Income x Percentage of Rainy Season
Total Income = $16 x 4 weeks = $64
Percentage of Rainy Season = (Number of Rains x 100) / Total Income
Number of Rains = 4 months x 4 weeks/month = 16 weeks
Therefore, the rain percentage is:
Percentage of Rainy Season = (16 x 100) / $64 = 25%
So, Louis makes $64 x 25% = $160 during the rainy season.";;;;;;;

= $93,730

Now, let's find out how much money Louis made each week:

Weekly income = Total amount earned / Number of weeks
= $93,730 / 233
= $403

So, Louis made $403 per week for 233 weeks, which is equal to $16598.";;;;;;;
Response:  The total amount of money earned by Louis in one year is $368 per week x 52 weeks = $18,744 per year. During the growing season (April to October), he earns $388 per week x 26 weeks = $9,068. Therefore, his annual income during the growing season is $9,068 + $9,676 = $18,744.;;;;;;;

From the given information, we can determine that there are 21 classes in the school and each class has 98 students. Since there are 7 buses available, the number of students who can travel in each bus is 98/7 = 14. Therefore, the total number of students who can travel in all 7 buses is 7 x 14 = 98.";;;;;;;

"Response: 120
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of students in each school as follows:
Total number of schools = 67
Total number of students in each school = Total number of classes x Number of students in each class
= 66 x 6
= 396
Now, let's assume that each bus has a seating capacity of 6 students.
Number of buses required to transport all students = Total number of students / Seating capacity of each bus
= 396 / 6
= 66
Therefore, there are 66 buses required to transport all students from these 67 schools.";;;;;;;
Response: 104;;;;;;;
Response: 36;;;;;;;
"Response: 36
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of seats available in each bus as follows:
Total number of students = 102
Number of buses = 8
Number of seats per bus = 7 (as there are 7 rows in each bus)
Total number of seats available = Number of buses x Number of seats per bus = 8 x 7 = 56
Now, let's assume that 22 students do not go for the trip. To find out how many students will be left behind, we need to subtract the number of students who did not go from the total number of students:
Total number of students - Number of students who did not go = 102 - 22 = 80
Therefore, 36 students will be left behind if 22 students do not go for the trip.";;;;;;;

"Response: 150
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the number of students who will be traveling in each bus as follows:
Number of students = Total number of students / Number of buses
= 720 students / 3 buses
= 240 students per bus
Since there are 3 buses, the total number of students traveling in all three buses is:
Total number of students = 240 + 240 + 240
= 720 students
Therefore, 720 students will be traveling in all three buses.";;;;;;;
Response: 30 seats. Explanation: From the given information, we know that there are 17 classes in the school and 46 students in each class. Therefore, the total number of seats available in all classes is 17 x 46 = 802 seats. Since there are 92 students in the school, the number of students per class is 92 / 46 = 2.04 students per seat (round off to 2 students per seat). So, there will be 2 seats for every student in the school.;;;;;;;

Explanation:
The number of balls required to fill all the boxes is calculated as follows:
Number of boxes = 11 (as per the question)
Capacity of each box = 9 gobbars (as per the question)
Total capacity of all boxes = Number of boxes x Capacity of each box
= 11 x 9
= 100

Explanation:
The given information can be used to calculate the number of days required for an ant to move from one end of a rectangular garden to the other. Let's assume that the length and width of the garden are 90 meters each.

1. The distance between two opposite corners of the garden is equal to the length of the garden multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them (since the angles are complementary). In this case, the distance between two opposite corners is 90 x cos(30) = 135 meters.
2. Since the ant starts at one corner of the garden, it needs to travel 135 meters to reach the opposite corner where its food is located.
3. To find out how many days the ant takes to cover this distance, we need to divide the distance by its speed in meters per day. According to the question, the ant moves at a rate of 2660 meters per day. Therefore, the time taken by the ant to cover the distance of 135 meters is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 135 / 2660 = 0.05 days
So, the ant takes approximately 0.05 days or 4 hours to move from one end of the garden to the other.";;;;;;;

Now, we need to calculate how much water is required to mix with this milk to make it equal to 1 liter of milk. The question states that 1 liter of milk contains 1/22 part of water. So, we can calculate the number of liters of water required as follows:
1 liter of milk / 1/22 = 46 liters of water
Therefore, the total amount of water required to mix with the milk produced by all goats in one day is:
592 liters + 46 liters = 638 liters

"Response: 610794538
Explanation:
The given question consists of two parts - (i) number of children who attended the summer camp and (ii) number of children who stayed at home.

Part (i): Number of children who attended the summer camp = 610794538
This is calculated by adding the numbers of children mentioned in each part of the question:
610794538 + 22 = 610796750

Part (ii): Number of children who stayed at home = 590794538
This is calculated by subtracting the number of children who attended the summer camp from the total number of children mentioned in the second part of the question:
590794538 - 610794538 = -51000000
Therefore, the answer to the question is 610794538.";;;;;;;

"Response: 120
Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:
Total number of apples = Number of apples in one basket x Number of baskets
= 6 x 3 = 18
Similarly, the number of apples in the other basket is:
Number of apples in second basket = Number of apples in one basket x Number of baskets
= 4 x 3 = 12
Therefore, the difference between the two baskets is:
Difference between the two baskets = Total number of apples in first basket - Total number of apples in second basket
= 18 - 12 = 6
So, there are 6 more apples in the first basket than in the second basket.";;;;;;;

Explanation: According to the question, Helena has 527 chocolates and 86 kishmishes in total. If she gives away 86 of them as gifts, then she will have 527 - 86 = 441 chocolates and kishmishes left. Since she already had 301 chocolates and kishmishes before giving any away, the final number of chocolates and kishmishes she has after giving some away is 441 + 301 = 742.";;;;;;;
"Response: 850
Explanation:
The number of chocolate chips in Helen's bag is 144 + 397 = 541. Since there are 850 grams in a pound, we can calculate the total weight of chocolate chips as follows:
541 chocolate chips x 850 grams/pound = 462,500 grams
Therefore, the weight of chocolate chips in Helen's bag is approximately 462.5 kilograms or 850 pounds.";;;;;;;

Explanation:
The total amount of money that Fred spent in the previous week is $111$. Jessie earned $40$ dollars during the same period. After deducting the amount earned by Jessie from the amount spent by Fred, we get $71$ dollars left with Fred. Since Jessie's earnings are also included in the total amount spent by Fred, we need to subtract Jessie's earnings from the total amount spent by Fred before calculating the remaining amount. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Fred has is $71 - $40 = $31$.";;;;;;;

Response: 27 kilograms.;;;;;;;
"Response:  Jessie's current weight is 70 kg and she wants to lose 12 kg in total. To calculate how many days it will take her to reach her target weight of 58 kg, we can use the following formula:

Days = (Current Weight - Target Weight) / Desired Weight Loss per Day

Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:

Days = (70 kg - 58 kg) / 126 kg/day
Days = 43 days

Therefore, Jessie will need to maintain a daily weight loss of 126 kg for approximately 43 days to reach her target weight of 58 kg.";;;;;;;
