"Response: 100
Explanation: The first part of the question asks how many pieces of candy (حلوى) Bob ate if he ate some of the candies and then ate 25 more afterwards. To find out how many pieces of candy Bob ate in total, we need to add the number of pieces he ate initially with the additional 25 pieces he ate later. Therefore, the answer is 100 pieces of candy."
"Response: 175
Explanation:
The first part of the question states that Bob ate 28 pieces of candy. The second part of the question states that he ate 42 more pieces of candy after eating the candy. Therefore, in total, Bob ate 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy.
Since each piece of candy is equal to 1/4 cup, and there are 63 cups of shawarma in the bowl, we can calculate the number of pieces of shawarma that Bob ate by dividing the total number of pieces of candy he ate (70) by the size of each piece of candy (1/4 cup):
70 / 1/4 = 175 pieces of shawarma."
"Response: 
To calculate the number of pieces of each food that Bob ate, we need to use the information provided in the question.

Bob ate 33 pieces of chicken and then ate 4 more pieces. This means he ate a total of 37 pieces of chicken (33 + 4).

He also ate 14 pieces of shawarma, which is not mentioned in the question how many pieces he ate before eating the chicken. Therefore, we cannot include this information in our calculation.

So, the final answer is:

Number of pieces of chicken Bob ate = 37
Number of pieces of shawarma Bob ate = Not given"

The price of one pound of honey is $6, and the price of one pound of sugar is $3, so the difference between the two prices is $6 - $3 = $3 per pound. Since you bought 6 pounds of honey for $6 and 3 pounds of sugar for $3, the total amount of money you spent on both items is $6 + $3 = $9. Therefore, you spent $10 more money to buy more honey than sugar."

Explanation:
To find out how many kekkahs and fattireh will be left for Becker, we need to subtract the number of kekkahs and fattireh that he bought from the total number of kekkahs and fattireh that were available initially.
The initial number of kekkahs was 61 + 167 = 228.
Becker bought 108 kekkahs and 44 fattireh, so the remaining number of kekkahs is:
228 - 108 = 120 kekkahs
The remaining number of fattireh is:
228 - 44 = 184 fattireh
Therefore, Becker will have 120 kekkahs and 184 fattireh left after buying some."

Cookies: 11 / 134 = 0.08 (or approximately 1 cookie per 13 biscuits)"
"Response: 206 kekah
Explanation:
The total number of cookies produced is 14 x 153 = 206 kekah. Therefore, if he sells 8 kekah and retains 97 kekah, he will have 206 - 8 = 208 kekah more than the cookies he sold."
"Response: 296
Explanation:
The total number of cookies sold is 43 x 114 = 4900.
Since 78 cookies were sold from the jar labeled ""Kek"", and there are 154 cookies in that jar, we can calculate the number of cookies sold from each jar as follows:
Number of cookies sold from each jar = Total number of cookies sold / Number of jars
= 4900 / 2 (jars)
= 2450
Therefore, more than 2450 cookies were sold from the jar labeled ""Kek"" compared to the other jar."

Response: 14 ktls.
Response: 43 ktls (approximately)
"Response: 56
Explanation:
The total number of bricks used in building the wall is 79 x 2 = 158 bricks.
Since 14 ktls are used for building the base of the wall and 11 ktls are used for building the foundation of the house, we have to subtract these amounts from the total number of bricks used. Therefore, the remaining amount of bricks that are left over after building the wall and the house is 158 - (14 + 11) = 56 bricks."
Response: 101 ktls (katls) are required to build both the palace and the house.
Response: 40 ktls are used to build the palace and 15 ktls are used to build the house. Therefore, the number of bricks used to build the palace is more than the number of bricks used to build the house by 25 ktls (40 - 15 = 25).

"Response: 375 ktls
Explanation:
To calculate the number of bricks required for building a palace and a house, we need to know the area of each structure in square meters. Let's assume that the palace has an area of 10,000 m^2 and the house has an area of 500 m^2.

For the palace:
Number of bricks = Area of palace / Size of brick (m^2) x Number of layers (ktls)
= 10,000 m^2 / 0.1 m^2 x 95 ktls
= 375 ktls

For the house:
Number of bricks = Area of house / Size of brick (m^2) x Number of layers (ktls)
= 500 m^2 / 0.1 m^2 x 20 ktls
= 100 ktls

Therefore, more than 3 times as many bricks are needed for building the palace compared to the house."
"Response: 45 ktls
Explanation:
The total number of bricks used to build the house is 90, and the number of bricks used for the foundation is 63. Therefore, the difference between the number of bricks used for the house and the number of bricks used for the foundation is 27 (90 - 63). Since the number of bricks used for the barn is 89, the maximum number of bricks that can be used for building both the house and the barn is 45 (89 + 27)."

"Response: 304 kgs (or 670 lbs)
Explanation:
The first part of the question states that they are cutting off 28 kg (or 62 lbs) of fat from the portly man's belly every day. This means that after 26 days, they will have cut off a total of 712 kg (or 1570 lbs) of fat from his belly.
However, since the second part of the question mentions that they are also removing 52 kg (or 115 lbs) of non-fat tissue from his body every day, we need to subtract this amount from the total weight of fat removed. Therefore, the final weight of fat removed from the man's body after 26 days is 670 lbs or 304 kg."

90 kg / 5 = 18 kg per day
So, at the end of 5 days, ""كونه"" will have 1800 grams (18 kg) of carrots."
"Response: 305 milliliters (mL)
Explanation:
The first part of the question states that ""كونه المفضل"" means he is the best, and therefore we can assume that he has access to the latest technology and equipment for his work. The second part of the question asks how much water he needs to fill up his container in 146 days, given that he uses 244 mL of water from the date palm tree every day and 47 mL of water from the tamarind tree every day. To calculate this, we need to know the volume of the container in which he will be filling the water. Based on the information provided earlier, the diameter of the container is 10 cm, and its height is 20 cm. Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (V = πr²h), where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height, we can calculate the volume of the container as follows: V = π(5cm)(20cm) = 305 cubic centimeters (cm³). Therefore, he will need 305 mL of water to fill up the container in 146 days."
"Response: 496 milliliters (mL)
Explanation:
The first part of the question states that the boy has 235 mL of toot and 221 mL of apple juice per day. To find out how much apple juice he can drink in one week, we need to multiply the daily amount by 7 days. Therefore, the total amount of apple juice he can drink in one week is:
221 mL/day x 7 days = 1557 mL/week
Now, let's convert this amount from milliliters to liters. There are 1000 milliliters in 1 liter, so:
1557 mL/week / 1000 mL/liter = 1.557 liters/week
Finally, since the question asks for the maximum amount of apple juice that can be stored in his stomach in one week, we divide the total amount by the number of days in the week:
1.557 liters/week ÷ 7 days = 496 mL
Therefore, the maximum amount of apple juice that can be stored in the boy's stomach in one week is 496 mL."

Explanation:
There are 20 homes in each neighborhood, and each home receives 9 non-urgent emails per day. Therefore, the total number of non-urgent emails received by all homes in a day is:
20 homes x 9 emails/home/day = 180 emails/day"
"Response: 24/6 = 4
Therefore, each house will receive 4 pieces of fast mail."
"Response: 3520 (approximately)
Explanation:
The number of emails sent per minute is given as 14.
There are approximately 60 seconds in a minute.
So, the total number of emails sent per second is 14 / 60 = 0.233 emails/second.
Now, we need to calculate the total number of emails sent in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour. So, the total number of emails sent in one hour is 0.233 emails/second x 3600 seconds/hour = 798 emails/hour.
Finally, to find the total number of emails sent in a day, we multiply the number of emails sent per hour by the number of hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day. So, the total number of emails sent in a day is 798 emails/hour x 24 hours/day = 18,776 emails/day.
To find the total number of emails sent in a week, we multiply the number of emails sent in a day by 7 days in a week. There are 7 days in a week. So, the total number of emails sent in a week is 18,776 emails/day x 7 days/week = 130,304 emails/week.
And finally, to find the total number of emails sent in a year, we multiply the number of emails sent in a week by 52 weeks in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year. So, the total number of emails sent in a year is 130,304 emails/week x 52 weeks/year = 6,596,480 emails/year."

Response: 4 groups of 8 white balls and 6 red balls means there are in total 32 white balls and 36 red balls.
"Response: 30
Explanation: To divide 60 white balls and 15 red balls into three groups of Riabikka, each group must have an equal number of both colors. Therefore, there are 20 white balls (60 / 3 = 20) and 5 red balls (15 / 3 = 5) in each group."
"Response: 30
Explanation: To determine the number of groups of 6 white balls and 72 moons that can be formed from 18 white balls and 66 red balls, we need to use combinatorics. We have 18 white balls, which can be grouped into sets of 6 (since there are 6 white balls in each set). Therefore, the total number of groups is 18 / 6 = 3. For each group of white balls, there are 72 moons available for distribution. Since there are 3 groups of white balls, there will be 3 x 72 = 216 moons distributed among them. Finally, since there are 66 red balls remaining after distributing the white balls and moons, they can be divided into 66 / 6 = 11 groups of red balls."

Explanation: To calculate the number of quails that can be produced in 72 days with 6 hens and each hen lays 3 eggs per day, we need to use simple arithmetic.

Number of eggs laid by 6 hens = 6 x 3 = 18 eggs/day
Total number of eggs laid in 72 days = 72 x 18 = 1264 eggs

Since each egg requires approximately 5 grams of protein, the total weight of all eggs laid in 72 days is:
Weight of 1264 eggs = 1264 x 5 = 6320 grams

Therefore, the number of quails that can be produced from these eggs is:
Number of quails = Weight of eggs / Weight of quail egg = 6320 grams / 100 grams = 63 quails
So, the answer is 63 quails."

"Response: 10 days
Explanation:
The first step is to calculate how many hours the machine worked in total during the day and night. The machine worked for 8 hours per day and 4 hours at night, so the total working time was:
8 hours/day x 24 hours/day = 192 hours/day
+ 4 hours/night x 2 nights = 8 hours/night
Total working time = 192 hours + 8 hours = 200 hours
Now, we need to divide the number of qamis (3) by the total working time (in hours):
Number of qamis / Total working time = 3 / 200 = 0.015
So, it took the machine approximately 10 days (or 150 hours) to make 3 qamis."
Response: 6 x 12 = 72 qms produced in one day and 14 x 12 = 176 qms produced in total during the week (assuming a 5-day workweek). Therefore, the machine can produce approximately 176 + 72 = 248 qms per week.
