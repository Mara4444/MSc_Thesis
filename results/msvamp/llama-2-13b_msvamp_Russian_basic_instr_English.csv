Answer:  There are 6 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket."
"Response:  There are 3 green persimmons in the basket.  
Explanation:  If there are 10 red persimmons and several green ones, then the total number of persimmons is 10 + X (where X is the number of green persimmons). Since the total number of persimmons is 15, we can set up the equation:  
10 + X = 15  
Solving for X, we get:  
X = 3  
Therefore, there are 3 green persimmons in the basket."
Response:  There are 10 more green persimmons than red persimmons in the basket, so there are 10 + 3 = 13 green persimmons in total.
Response:  There are 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 persimmons in the basket.
Response:  There are more green persimmons (8) than red persimmons (7).
Response:  There are 14 green persimmons in the basket, and there are 6 yellow persimmons. Therefore, there are 14 - 6 = 8 more green persimmons than yellow persimmons.

Response:  There are 11 x (10 + 18) = 11 x 28 = 318 persi...
Response:  There are 6 corzins with persimmons, and each contains 16 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. To find out how many red persimmons there are in total, multiply the number of corzins by the number of red persimmons in each corzin:  6 x 16 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 red persimmons in total.
Response:  There are 7 x 2 = 14 green persimmons in all baskets.
"Response:  There are 7 persimmons in total and each basket contains 4 red persimmons and 3 green persimmons. To find out how many baskets there are, we can divide the total number of persimmons by the number of persimmons in each basket:  
7 (total) = 4 x (number of red baskets) + 3 x (number of green baskets) 
We know that there are 4 red persimmons in each red basket and 3 green persimmons in each green basket. So, we can substitute these values into the equation above:  
7 = 4x + 3(green baskets) 
Now, solve for ""x"" (the number of red baskets):  
7 = 4x + 3(green baskets) 
4x + 3(green baskets) = 7 
Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:  
4x + 3(green baskets) = 28 
Since there are 3 green baskets, the equation becomes:  
4x + 9 = 28 
Subtract 9 from both sides:  
4x = 19 
Divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:  
x = 5 
Therefore, there are 5 red baskets with 4 red persimmons in each basket, for a total of 20 red persimmons. Since there are also 3 green baskets with 3 green persimmons in each basket, there are a total of 9 green persimmons. In all, there are 20 + 9 = 29 persimmons in 6 baskets."
Response:  There are 12 persimmons in total, and each basket has 4 red persimmons and some green ones. So, there are 4 x 2 = 8 red persimmons in both baskets, and the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 green persimmons in one of the baskets. Therefore, there are 4 green persimmons in each basket.
Response:  There are 3 green persimmons in the basket.
"Response:  There are 15 x 23 = 345 red persimmons and 15 x 4 = 60 green persimmons in total.

"Response:  There are 10 corzins with persimmons in total, and each corzin contains 4 red persimmons and 6 green persimmons. To find out how many corzins have persimmons, we can multiply the number of red persimmons by the number of green persimmons to get the total number of persimmons in each corzin:  
4 (red) x 6 (green) = 24 persimmons per corzin.  Since there are 10 corzins in total, the total number of persimmons is:  
24 (persimmons/corzin) x 10 (corzins) = 240 persimmons."
"Response:  There are 6 green persimmons in the basket, and 2 red persimmons. To find out how many more green persimmons there are than red persimmons, we need to subtract the number of red persimmons from the total number of green persimmons.

Response: 4 pigeons have flown to the fence and perched alongside the two birds that were already there, bringing the total number of birds on the fence to six (6).
"Response:  If there were initially x pigeons sitting on the fence and 4 more pigeons joined them, then the total number of pigeons now is x + 4 = 5. So we can set up the equation:  
x + 4 = 5  To solve for x, subtract 4 from both sides:  
x + 4 - 4 = 5 - 4  
x = 1 Solution: There were initially 1 pigeon sitting on the fence."
Response:  There are 4 + 6 = 10 pti...
Response:  There are 3 pigeons and 2 doves on the fence, so there are 3 + 2 = 5 birds in total.
Response:  There are 3 pigeons and 4 sparrows (total of 7 birds) sitting on the fence. If 2 more pigeons join them, then there will be 3 + 2 = 5 pigeons and 4 sparrows, making a total of 9 birds. So, there are 9 birds that are not sparrows (pigeons) sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 aisles and 2 birds, so there are 6 - 2 = 4 more aisles than birds.
Response:  There are 6 aisles (birds) sitting on the perch initially, and 2 more aisles join them later. Therefore, there are in total 6 + 2 = 8 aisles sitting on the perch.
Response:  There are 3 pigeons and 4 eagles (total of 7 birds) sitting on the fence initially. When 6 more eagles join them, there will be a total of 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 pigeons and 3 doves on the fence, for a total of 9 birds. If 2 more doves join them, there will be 11 birds in total (6 pigeons + 3 doves + 2 doves). Therefore, there are 9 pigeons and 2 doves on the fence.
Response:  There are 4 pigeons and 3 doves sitting on the fence. If 6 more doves join them, then there will be 4 + 6 = 10 doves in total. Since there are only 4 pigeons, there are more doves (10) than pigeons (4) sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 pigeons + 4 birds = 10 birds sitting on the fence.
"Response:  There are 2 pigeons + 5 birds = 7 birds sitting on the fence.  
There are 4 eagles = 4. 
So, there are more birds (7) than eagles (4) sitting on the fence."
"Response:  There are 6 aisles more than birds sitting on the fence.  
Explanation: Let's say there were x birds sitting on the fence initially. When two more birds joined them, the total number of birds became x + 2. Later, six storks also sat on the fence, bringing the total to x + 2 + 6 = x + 8. So, there are eight more storks than birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  There are 3 aists and 4 ptiс on the fence, so there are more ptiс (7) than aists (3).
Response:  There are 6 aisov and 2 birds on the fence initially, so there are 6 + 2 = 8 living beings on the fence to start with. When 3 more birds join them, there will be 8 + 3 = 11 living beings in total on the fence. Therefore, there are 11 - 6 = 5 more birds than aisovs on the fence.
Response:  There are 6 storks and 2 birds sitting on the fence, so there are 6 + 2 = 8 animals in total. Since there are only 3 birdssitting on the fence initially, there must be more storks (6) than birds (3). Therefore, the difference between the number of storks and birds is 6 - 3 = 3.

Response: 16 лагерников (32 - 15 = 16) went to the beach after lunch.
Response:  If 7 people went to the dam in the day and 60 people went to the dam altogether that day, then 53 people (60 - 7) went to the dam in the morning.
Response:  The total number of laagerinners who went to the beach is 36 + 13 + 49 = 98.
"Response:  The difference between the number of laagerinners who went swimming in the morning and those who did so during the day is:

44 - 39 = 5

Therefore, more people went swimming in the morning than during the day."
"Response:  The difference between the number of laagerinners who went for a swim in the morning and those who did so in the evening is:

43 (morning) - 49 (evening) = 6 fewer people went swimming in the evening than in the morning."
"Response:  The difference between the number of laagerers who went to the dam in the day and those who went in the evening is:

34 (day) - 10 (evening) = 24."
Response: 44 лагерника пошло на греблю (13 + 21 + 59 - 2 = 44).
Response:  There were more laagerinners who went to the dam in the morning than after lunch because 29 + 26 = 55 people went to the dam in the morning, and 66 - 26 = 40 people went to the dam after lunch. So, there were 15 more people who went to the dam in the morning than after lunch.
Response:  There were 41 + 4 = 45 laagerniks in total. Of these, 41 went to the dam and 4 went on a hike in the morning. In the afternoon, 26 laagerniks went to the dam, so the total number of laagerniks who went to the dam is 41 + 26 = 67. The total number of laagerniks who went on a hike is 4.
"Response:  Several lagerniks went to the dam in the daytime. Let X be the number of lagernik who went to the dam during the day. We know that 43 laageriniks went to the dam in the morning and some more lagernicks went to the dam during the day. So we can write an equation: 
X + 43 = Y 
Where Y is the total number of lagernicks who went to the dam. The problem states that 46 lagernicks went to the dam in one day. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 
Y = X + 43 = 46 
Solving for X, we get: 
X = 13 
Therefore, 13 lagernicks went to the dam during the day."

Response:  Duge lost  6 mraorms.
"Response:  There were 34 more mraormors with Ed than with Doug.  
Explanation:  If Ed had 45 marbles and lost none, then he had 45 - 0 = 45 marbles. 
If Doug lost 11 marbles, then he had 10 - 11 = -1 marbles (since he has negative number of marbles). 
So, there were 45 - (-1) = 46 marbles with Ed, which is 34 more than the number of marbles with Doug."
Response:  If Ed had 22 marbles and Doug lost 7 of his marbles, then Doug has 22 - 7 = 15 marbles now.
Response:  If Ed had 27 marbles and Doug lost 3 of his marbles, then Doug initially had 27 - 3 = 24 marbles.
"Response:  To find out how many more mraormors Ed had than Doug, we need to subtract the number of marbles that Doug lost from the total number of marbles he had:  
Let's start by finding out how many marbles Doug had at first:  
Doug had 24 mraormors at first, so his initial amount was 24. Now let's find out how many marbles he lost:  
Doug lost 27 marbles, so he has 24 - 27 = -3 marbles left. Since he can't have negative marbles, we know that he must have lost all of them and now has zero marbles.  
Now, let's find out how many marbles Ed had at first:  
Ed had 24 + 9 = 33 marbles at first. So, Ed had 33 - 24 = 9 more marbles than Doug."
Response:  There are 29 - 17 = 12 more mraormors with Ed than with Doug.
Response:  Эд потерял  11 (19 - 8) мраморов.
Response:  There were 91 mraorms with Ed and 70 mraorms with Doug. So, Ed had 21 more mraorms than Doug.
Response:  If Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug and lost 20 of his marbles, then he must have had 12 + 20 = 32 marbles initially. Since he has only 17 marbles left now, we can subtract 32 - 17 = 15 from the number of marbles he had to find out how many marbles Doug had. Therefore, Doug has 15 marbles now.
Response:  There are more students who proposed adding carrot puree (408) than those who proposed adding bacon (42), so there are 408 - 42 = 366 more students who proposed adding carrot puree than bacon.
Response: 10 studnets (489 - 479 = 10) more students proposed adding bacon to the menu than those who proposed adding carrot puree.
Response: 185 - 185 = 0 studnets proposed to add bacon to the menu.
Response: 19 (264 - 245 = 19)
"Response:  To find out how many students proposed adding bacon to the menu, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes from the total number of students who made suggestions.  
Let X be the number of students who suggested adding bacon. Then, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is 457 - X.  Since 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested adding bacon, we can set up the equation:  
457 - X = 63  Solving for X, we get:  X = 294  Therefore, there were 294 students who suggested adding bacon to the menu."
Response:  To find out how many students proposed adding bacon more than those who proposed adding mashed potatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes from the total number of students who made suggestions.  182 - 166 = 16 Therefore, 16 students proposed adding bacon more than those who proposed adding mashed potatoes.
"Response:  To find out how many students participated in suggesting new food items, we need to add up all the numbers of students who proposed each item. Therefore, the total number of students who participated is:  
324 + 374 + 128 = 826."
"Response:  To find out how many students preferred carrot pudding more than those who suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who made suggestions.  
Let's do that:  
Total number of students = 257 + 120 + 97 = 474  
Subtracting the number of students who suggested bacon (120) from the total number of students gives us:  
474 - 120 = 354  
Therefore, there were 354 students who preferred carrot pudding more than those who suggested bacon."
"Response:  To determine how many students proposed adding carrot puree more than those who proposed adding tomatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who proposed adding tomatoes from the total number of students who made suggestions.  
Let's do that:  
Total number of students = 144 + 467 + 79 = 680  
Number of students proposing carrot puree = 144  
Number of students proposing tomatoes = 79  
Now let's subtract the number of students proposing tomatoes from the total number of students:  
680 - 79 = 601  
Therefore, there are 601 students who proposed adding carrot puree more than those who proposed adding tomatoes."
"Response:  To find out how many students more preferred bacon than those who suggested tomatoes, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested tomatoes from the total number of students who made suggestions.  

So, if 23 students suggested tomatoes and 337 students suggested bacon, then: 

337 - 23 = 314 

Therefore, there are 314 students more who preferred bacon than tomatoes."
"Response:  To find out how many students participated in suggesting new dishes, we need to add up the number of students who suggested adding carrot puree (450), beef (38), and those who did not participate (remaining 127 - 450 = 87). Therefore, the total number of students who participated is:  
450 + 38 + 87 = 675."
Response: 351 student proposed to add only bacon in the menu.
"Response:  To find out how many students preferred carrot puree more than bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who preferred bacon from the total number of students.  
Let's do that:  
Total number of students = 269 + 330 + 76 = 785  
Number of students who preferred bacon = 269  
Number of students who preferred carrot puree = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred bacon = 785 - 269 = 516  
Therefore, there were 516 students who preferred carrot puree more than bacon."
Response:  There are 569 - 236 = 333 more girls than boys in school.
Response:  There are 841 boys in school and 34 girls, so there are 841 - 34 = 807 more boys than girls in school.
Response:  There are 232 x 2 = 464 girls in the school (since each girl is counted twice). Therefore, there are  464 - 464 = 0 boys in the school.  So, there are no boys in the school.
"Response:  If there are 228 more girls than boys in the school and the total number of students is 697, then we can set up the following equation to find out how many boys there are:  
Let x be the number of boys. Then the number of girls (G) = x + 228. We know that G = 697 - x, since there are 697 students in total and G is the number of girls. Substituting G = x + 228 into the first equation, we get:  
x + 228 = 697 - x  
Simplifying the equation by subtracting x from both sides, we get:  
228 = x  
Therefore, there are 228 boys in the school."
Response:  There are 510 more boys than girls in this school. To find out how many boys there are, we can add 510 to the number of girls. So, there are 635 + 510 = 1145 boys in this school.
"Response:  There are 868 students in the school, and there are 281 more girls than boys. To find out how many students are in the school, we can add the number of girls to the number of boys. Let's start by finding out how many boys are in the school:  
Boys = 868 - 281 (since there are 281 more girls) Boys = 868 - 281 = 587 Therefore, there are 587 boys in the school. Now let's find out how many girls are in the school: Girls = 868 - 587 (since there are 587 boys) Girls = 868 - 587 = 281 Therefore, there are 281 girls in the school. So, there are a total of 587 boys and 281 girls in the school, for a total of 868 students."
"Response:  There are 700 x 100 = 70,000 students in this school.  
Since there are 142 more boys than girls, the number of boys is:  
142 + 700 = 842 boys."
"Response:  The total number of students in school now is:  
706 + 418 = 1124"
Response:  There are now 902 + 44 = 946 girls in school.
"Response:  There are 632 + 465 = 1097 students in school.  
Since there are more girls (632) than boys (410), the difference between the number of girls and boys is: 
632 - 410 = 222.  Therefore, there are 222 more girls than boys in school."
Response:  There are currently 732 + 682 = 1414 girls in school.
Response:  To find out how many boys are in school now, we need to add the number of new boys (910) to the original number of boys (214). So, there are 910 + 214 = 1124 boys in school now.
Response:  The total number of students in this school is 308 + 318 = 626.
"Response:  To find out how many people are in the school, we need to add up the number of students and teachers.  
Number of students = 315 (girls) + 309 (boys) = 624 
Number of teachers = 772 
Therefore, there are a total of 624 + 772 = 1396 people in the school."
Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. If there are 739 girls in the school and the number of boys is less than the number of girls, we can let x represent the number of boys. Since there are more girls than boys, we know that x < 739. We also know that the total number of students in the school is equal to the sum of the number of boys and girls, so we can write the equation:  739 + x = 402 + x + x  Simplifying the equation, we get:  739 + x = 402 + 2x  Subtracting 402 from both sides gives us:  337 = 2x  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  168 = x  So, there are 168 boys in the school.
Response:  If there are 692 girls in the school and there are more girls than boys, then the total number of students in the school is at least 692 + x, where x is the number of boys. Since there are 458 more girls than boys, we can set up the equation:  692 + x = 692 + (458) = 1150. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 1150.
Response:  There are more girls (403) than boys (362) in school, so there are 403 - 362 = 41 more girls than boys in school.

Response:  Before Edward spent his money, he had $6 + 92 = 98 dollars.
"Response:  Each book cost $6/2 = $3.  

Question:  If Sally spent 4 hours reading 2 books, how long would she spend reading 4 books? 
Answer:  If Sally spent 4 hours reading 2 books, then she spent 2 hours per book. Therefore, if she reads 4 books, she will spend 4 x 2 = 8 hours reading them."
Response:  Before Edward spent his money, he had $25 (19 + 6).
Response:  To find out how much Ed spent on books and pens, we need to subtract the amount he spent on pens from the total amount of money he has. Let's do that:  12 - 3 = 9  So, Ed spent $9 on books.
"Response:  To find out how much Ed spent on books compared to pens, we need to divide the amount he spent on books by the total amount he had. Let's do that:  

16 dollars / 19 dollars = 0.842 (approximately)  So, Ed spent about 84% of his money on books and 16% on pens."
Response:  Before spending any money, Edward had $17 dollars.
"Response:  Let's say that the total number of push-ups made by both Zahary and David is x. Since David made 58 more push-ups than Zahary, we can write an equation:  
Zahary made push-ups = 44 + (58 - 44) = 44 + 14 = 58  
Therefore, together they made 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups."
Response: 7 (51 - 44 = 7).
Response:  Закари сделал  35 (44 - 9) отжиманий.
Response:  The sum of David's and Zachary's push-ups is 51 + 49 = 100.
"Response:  To find out how many push-ups David did, we need to subtract the number of push-ups that Zachary did from the total number of push-ups done by both students. Let's use the information given in the problem:  
Zachary did 59 push-ups. David did fewer push-ups than Zachary by 19 push-ups less (since he did 44 scruples more). So, David did:  
Push-ups = 59 - 19 = 40 push-ups."
"Response:  To find out how many scruples David made, we need to subtract the number of scruples that Zachary made from the total number of scruples that David made. Let's do this:  

David made 29 more than Zachary, so we can write an equation: 

David = Zachary + 29 

Zachary made 44 odzhima and 17 skrukivaniya, so we can write: 

Zachary = 44 + 17 = 61 

Now we substitute the value of Zachary into the equation for David: 

David = 61 + 29 = 90 

So David made 90 scruples."
"Response:  To find out how many push-ups and sit-ups Zahary did, we need to use the information that David did 17 more push-ups than Zahary but 10 fewer sit-ups. Let's start by writing an equation for the number of push-ups:  
Let P be the number of push-ups done by Zahary. Since David did 17 more push-ups, David did P + 17 push-ups. We know that David did fewer sit-ups than Zahary, so we can write another equation using the number of sit-ups:  
We want to find out how many push-ups and sit-ups Zahary did, so we can substitute the values we know into one of these equations. For example, let's substitute the value of 53 for the number of sit-ups:  
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (P and Z). Can you solve this system of linear equations to find out how many push-ups and sit-ups Zahary did?"
"Response:  To find out how many more push-ups than sit-ups Zahary made, we need to subtract the number of sit-ups from the total number of push-ups.  
Zahary did 35 push-ups and 3 sit-ups, so:  
35 - 3 = 32  
Therefore, Zahary did 32 more push-ups than sit-ups."
"Response:  To find out how many more scruples than push-ups Zahary made, we need to subtract the number of push-ups David made from the total number of scruples Zahary made. Let's do that:  
Zahary made 46 push-ups + 58 scruples = 104 exercises in total. 
David made 38 more push-ups than Zahary, so: 
David made 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups. 
Now, let's subtract the number of push-ups David made from the total number of exercises Zahary did:  
104 - 84 = 20. 
So, Zahary made 20 more scruples than push-ups."
"Response:  To find out how many push-ups David did, we can start by using the information that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. Let's call the number of push-ups Zachary did x. Then, David did 39 + x push-ups. We also know that John did 13 fewer push-ups than David, so John did 39 + x - 13 push-ups. We can set up an equation based on this information:

x + (39 + x) = (39 + x) - 13

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 39 = 39 + x - 13

Solving for x:

2x = 52

x = 26

So, Zachary did 26 push-ups, and David did 39 + 26 = 65 push-ups."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of push-ups made by John as J. Since David made 22 more push-ups than Zachary, we can write an equation based on that information: 

David made = Zachary + 22... (1)

We know that John made 4 fewer push-ups than David, so we can write another equation: 

John made = David - 4... (2)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: 

John made = (Zachary + 22) - 4
= Zachary + 18

Therefore, John made 18 push-ups."
"Response:  To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we need to subtract the number of push-ups John did from the number of push-ups Zachary did. Let's use variables to represent the numbers of push-ups each person did:

Z = number of push-ups Zachary did
J = number of push-ups John did

From the problem statement, we know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary:

D = Z + 39

We also know that John did 9 fewer push-ups than David:

J = D - 9

Now we can substitute the expressions for D and J into the equation for Z:

Z = J + 9

Substituting J = D - 9, we get:

Z = (D - 9) + 9

Simplifying, we have:

Z = D + 9

So Zachary did D + 9 push-ups, which is greater than John by D + 9 - 9 = D push-ups. Therefore, the difference between Zachary's and John's push-up count is D."
Response:  If David made 37 push-ups and he did 30 more than Zachary, then Zachary made  37 - 30 = 7 push-ups.
Response:  If David made 38 push-ups and Zachary made x push-ups, then together they made 38 + x push-ups.
"Response:  To find out how many scruples David made, we need to subtract the number of push-ups he did less than Zachary from the total number of push-ups he did. So, if Zachary did 34 push-ups and 62 scruples, and David did 40 more push-ups but 17 fewer scruples, then:  

Number of scruples David did = Total number of push-ups - (Push-ups done by Zachary - Push-ups done by David) 
= 62 - (34 - 40 + 17) 
= 62 - (34 + 17) 
= 62 - 51 
= 11 
Therefore, David did 11 scruples."
Response:  To find out how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did, we need to subtract the number of crunches from the total number of push-ups and pull-ups. So, if Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches, then he did 58 - 33 = 25 more push-ups than crunches.
"Response:  To find out how many more scruples than push-ups David did, we need to subtract the number of push-ups he did from the total number of scruples he did. Let's do that:  

David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can say that: 

27 = (Total number of scruples - Total number of push-ups) 

We know that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 scruples, so let's substitute those numbers into the equation: 

27 = (17 - 5) 

Solve for the unknown variable (in this case, ""Total number of scruples""): 

27 = 12 

So, there are 12 more scruples than push-ups that David did compared to Zachary."
"Response:  There were 3 more pages of mathematical exercises than reading.  
Explanation:  If Rachel had to do 5 pages of math homework and only 2 pages of reading, then there were 5 - 2 = 3 more pages of math exercises than reading."
Response:  If Rachel had to do 3 pages of mathematical homework and 4 pages of reading, then the number of pages of reading is 4 more than the number of pages of mathematical homework. So, the number of pages of reading is 3 + 4 = 7.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework and several pages of reading, then she must have completed at least  7 + x pages of reading, where x is the number of pages of reading that she had to do.  Since we know that she did 5 pages of math homework, we can set up the equation:  7 + x = 5 + x. Solving for x, we get:  x = 2. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 2 more pages of reading than she did of math homework.
Response:  If Rachel had to complete 7 pages of mathematical homework and she had to do 4 pages more of mathematics than reading, then she had to read for 3 pages (7 - 4 = 3).

Response:  If Jack received 5 letters in total for the day and he received 4 electronic mails in the morning, then he must have received  1 letter in the second half of the day.
Response: 14 (6 + 3 + 5)
Response: 5 (morning) + 8 (evening) = 13 letters received by Jack in total.
Response: 5 (daily) + 8 (evening) = 13 letters received by Jack in total.
Response:  Jack received 3 electronic letters in the morning and 8 electronic letters in the evening, so he received a total of  3 + 8 = 11 electronic letters that day.
"Response:  The difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and the number he received during the day is:  

10 - (7 + 17) = 10 - 24 = -14 

So, Jack received 14 fewer emails in the morning than he did during the day."
Response: 2 (9 - 7 = 2).
Response: 5 (the number of letters Jack received during the day) - 4 (the number of letters Jack received in the evening) = 1 more letter that Jack received during the day than in the evening.
Response: 3.
Response:  The total number of electronic letters Jack received in one day is = (3 + 5) = 8.
Response: 12 (5 + 9) + 7 = 12.
Response:  The number of electronic letters Jack received in the morning is 10 + 12 = 22. The number of electronic letters he received in the afternoon is 3 + 44 = 47. Therefore, Jack received more electronic letters in the morning than in the afternoon by 22 - 47 = -25.
"Response:  The number of letters Jack received in the morning is 8, and the number of letters he received in the afternoon is 7. To find out how many more letters Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, subtract the number of letters he received in the afternoon from the number of letters he received in the morning:  
8 - 7 = 1 Therefore, Jack received one more letter in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  To find out how many electronic letters Jack received in one day, we need to add up the number of letters he sent and received. In the morning, he sent 91 emails and received 2 emails, so he received 91 + 2 = 93 electronic letters. In the evening, he sent 74 emails but did not receive any, so he received no additional emails. Therefore, Jack received a total of 93 electronic letters in one day.
Response: 14 (4 + 2 + 6 + 8)
"Response: 2 (two) electronic mails received by Jack in the second half of the day.  
Explanation: If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and we want to find out how many he received in the afternoon, we subtract the number of emails he received in the morning from the total number of emails he received during the day. Therefore, the number of emails Jack received in the second half of the day is 9 - 7 = 2."

Response:  Liaugsha pried on 3 dulim (12 - 9 = 3).
Response:  To find out how far they jumped together, we need to add the distances that each one jumped:  31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  Liauguska pyrged on 31 dynim (17 + 15).
"Response:  To find out how many dudimms the mouse jumped, we need to use information from all three animals' jumps. Let's start by writing down what we know:

* Sparrow jumped 25 inches (d)
* Frog jumped 18 inches (d) farther than the sparrow
* Mouse jumped 2 inches (d) farther than the frog

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the sparrow, so we can write an equation based on that:

Frog's jump = Sparrow's jump + 18

We also know that the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so we can add that to our equation:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump + 2

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the sparrow's jump and the mouse's jump). Can you solve for one of them in terms of the other? Try using substitution or elimination to solve for the mouse's jump in terms of the sparrow's jump. Once you have the solution, check your work by plugging it back into one of the original equations to make sure it's true."
"Response:  To find out how many dots beyond Soroka Mice pounced, we need to subtract the distance that Lizards jumped from the distance that Soroka jumped.  

Let's start by finding out how far Lizards jumped: 

Lizards jumped = 10 dюймов more than Soroka jumped 

Soroka jumped = 19 dюймов 

So, Lizards jumped = Soroka jumped + 10 dюймов 

= 19 dюймов + 10 dюймов 

= 29 dюймов 

Now let's find out how far Mice jumped: 

Mice jumped = 20 dюймов more than Lizards jumped 

Lizards jumped = 29 dюймов 

So, Mice jumped = Lizards jumped + 20 dюймов 

= 29 dюймов + 20 dюймов 

= 49 dюймов 

Therefore, Mice jumped 49 dюймов farther than Soroka."
Response:  Liauguska pried on 58 dynim (39 - 19 = 58).

"Response:  To find out how many dюймов pried мышь, we can use the information that the lizard jumped 19 dюймов further than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 dюймов less than the frog. Let's start by finding out how far the frog jumped:  
Frog jumped = 39 dюймов (given) Now, let's find out how far the lizard jumped:  
Lizard jumped = Frog jumped + (Lizard jumped - Mouse jumped) Lizard jumped = 39 dюймов + (19 dюймов - 12 dюймов) Lizard jumped = 39 dюймов + 7 dюймов Lizard jumped = 46 dюймов So, the lizard jumped 46 dюймок. Finally, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped:  
Mouse jumped = Frog jumped - (Lizard jumped - Mouse jumped) Mouse jumped = 39 dюймов - (46 dюймов - 12 dюймов) Mouse jumped = 39 dюймов - 34 dюймов Mouse jumped = 5 dюймов Therefore, the mouse jumped 5 dюймок."
"Response:  The grasshopper jumped farther than the mouse.  

Question: How many times did the mouse run around the field before it was caught by the owl? 
Answer:  The mouse ran around the field 3 times before it was caught by the owl."
"Response:  Likely, neither pried nor cuiseck jumped at all; they are both insects and do not have the ability to jump."
"Response:  To find out how many inches (dюймов) the mouse jumped, we need to use information from all three animals' jumps. Let's start by converting each animal's jump distance to inches:  
Sparrow's jump was 9 inches (9 dюймов). Lizard's jump was 33 inches + 9 inches = 42 inches (42 дюйма). Mouse's jump was 3 inches less than lizard's jump, so: Mouse's jump = 42 inches - 3 inches = 40 inches (40 дюйма). Therefore, the mouse jumped 40 inches (101 cm)."
Response:  The mouse jumped 3 times farther than the cricket.
Response:  Mary needs to add  9 (14 - 5) cups of flour and  3 (6 - 5) cups of sugar.
"Response:  To determine how much sugar Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (4 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (9 cups). This gives us:  

9 - 4 = 5 cups of flour left to add Sugar is added in proportion to the flour, so for every cup of flour, we need to add 1/2 cup of sugar. Therefore, to make the cake, Mary needs to add:  

5 x 1/2 = 2 1/2 cups of sugar"
Response:  Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour (6 - 8 = 2).
Response:  Mary needs 2 cups of flour more than sugar, so she has added  2 + 7 = 9 cups of flour.
Response: 8 чашек муки (3 + 6 = 8).
Response:  Mary needs 2 cups of flour to complete the recipe. If she has already added some amount of flour and still needs 2 cups more, then she must have added 10 cups (2 - 10 = 2) of flour so far.
Response:  Mary needs to add   (9 - 3) = 6 more cups of flour.
Response:  Mary needs to add   (14 - 2) = 12 more cups of sugar.
Response:  Mary needs to add  1 (one) more cup of flour.
"Response:  To determine how much flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added (7 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (10 cups). This gives us:  
Flour needed = 10 - 7 = 3 cups  
To determine how much sugar Mary needs to add, we can use the same method:  
Sugar needed = 2 - 0 (she has already added none) = 2 cups  
Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar to her mixture."
"Response:  To determine how much flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (12 cups). This gives us:  
12 - 2 = 10 cups of flour left to add.  Similarly, to determine how much salt is needed, we can subtract the amount she has already added (7 cups) from the total amount of salt required in the recipe (7 cups):  
7 - 2 = 5 cups of salt left to add."
"Response:  To determine how much sugar (8 cups) Mary needs to add more than salt (7 cups), we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (5 cups) from the total amount of each ingredient.  

Sugar: 8 cups - 5 cups = 3 cups  
Salt: 7 cups - 5 cups = 2 cups  
Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 cups of sugar and 2 cups of salt to her mixture."
Response:  To determine how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (13 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 13 - 2 = 11 more cups of sugar.
Response:  Mary needs to add  5 (9 - 4) cups of flour and  2 (6 - 4) cups of sugar.
"Response:  To determine how much flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (9 cups). This gives us:  

9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups 
So, Mary needs to add 7 cups of flour. As for sugar, since there are 6 cups of sugar in the recipe and Mary has already added 2 cups, she needs to add an additional:  

6 cups - 2 cups = 4 cups 
of sugar."
Response:  Mary needs to add  5 - 11 = 4 cups of sugar and  14 - 11 = 3 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary needs 5 cups of flour more than sugar, so she has already added (5 - 3) = 2 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary needs 12 cups of flour to make her cake. If she has already added several cups of flour and still needs 12 cups, then she must have added 12 - x cups of flour, where x is the number of cups of flour she had already added. Since the recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour, we can set up an equation based on this information:  5x + 12 = 12(12)  Simplifying the equation by multiplying both sides by 12 gives us:  5x + 120 = 144  Subtracting 120 from both sides gives us:  5x = 24  Dividing both sides by 5 gives us:  x = 4  Therefore, Mary has already added 4 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary needs to add  7 - 14 = 7 more cups of flour (muck).
Response:  Mary needs to add  2 more cups of sugar (10 - 8 = 2).
Response:  To determine how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added (6 cups) from the total amount required in the recipe (10 cups). Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of flour (10 - 6 = 4).
"Response:  To determine how much flour Mary needs to add to exceed the amount of sugar, we need to subtract the amount of sugar from the total amount of flour.  

Let's do that:  
Total flour = 14 x 4 = 56 cups  
Total sugar = 9 x 4 = 36 cups  
Subtracting the amount of sugar from the total flour gives us:  
56 - 36 = 20 cups  
Therefore, Mary needs to add 20 cups of flour to exceed the amount of sugar in the recipe."
"Response:  To determine how much flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required in the recipe (7 cups). This gives us:  

7 - 2 = 5 cups of flour left to add. 

To determine how much salt Mary needs to add, we can use the same method by subtracting the amount of salt she has already added (0 cups) from the total amount of salt required in the recipe (4 cups):  

4 - 0 = 4 cups of salt left to add."
Response:  Mary needs to add more sugar (11 - 12 = 3) than salt (9).
Response:  Mary needs to add  3 more cups of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  Mary needs to add more flour (14 - 10 = 4) than sugar (12 - 10 = 2).
Response:  There are 13 families of birds that have not migrated for winter (19 - 60 = 13).
Response:  If 7 families of birds have migrated for the winter, then 87 - 7 = 80 families of birds remain behind.
"Response:  There were 20 families of birds that migrated and 14 families that remained. To find out how many families lived near the mountain initially, we need to subtract the number of families that migrated (20) from the number of families that remained (14), which gives us:  
20 - 14 = 6. So, there were 6 families of birds that lived near the mountain initially."
Response:  There are 85 families of birds living near the mountain. If 23 families flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia, then there are 85 - 23 - 37 = 25 families of birds remaining near the mountain.
Response:  There are more families of birds that have migrated to Africa (42) than to Asia (31), so the difference is 11 (42 - 31).
Response:  There are more families of birds that flew to Asia (94) than to Africa (47), so the difference is 94 - 47 = 47 families of birds that flew to Asia.
Response:  There are 18 families of birds living near the mountain. If 38 families flew to Africa and 80 families flew to Asia, then 18 - 38 = 52 families of birds remained in the area for wintering.
Response:  There are now 87 + 18 = 105 families of birds living near the mountain.
"Response:  There are 49 families of birds living near the mountain, and 24 new families have arrived from the Arctic to live there. Therefore, the total number of families of birds living near the mountain is:  
49 + 24 = 73 families of birds."
Response:  If initially there were 41 families of birds near the mountain and 27 families migrated to warmer climates for winter, then 14 families (41 - 27 = 14) remained near the mountain.
Response:  There were 45 families of birds initially living near the mountain, and 86 families migrated to warmer climates for the winter. Therefore, 86 - 45 = 41 families of birds migrated for the winter.
Response: 62 - 35 = 27 families of birds flew to Africa more than those that flew to Asia.
"Response:  There are 2 families of birds left near the mountain, as 26 new families arrived from the Arctic and 2 families migrated further south for winter.

Response:  There are 253 - 70 = 183 caranadashes left with Pol at the end of the school year.
Response:  To find out how many caran dishes Paul received on his birthday, we need to divide the number of remaining carandashes by the number of carandashes he lost or gave away. So, if he has 177 carandashes left and lost or gave away 551 carandashes, then:  177 / 551 = 0.324 or 32.4% Therefore, Paul received 32.4% of the total number of carandashes on his birthday.
Response:  There are 293 pencils left (440 - 111 + 106 = 293).
"Response:  To find out how many pencils were lost or given away, we need to subtract the number of pencils that were given away (213) from the total number of pencils in the box (65). So, the difference is:  
65 - 213 = 43  Therefore, 43 pencils were lost or given away."
"Response:  To find out how many more caranadshas Pol gave to his friends than he lost, we need to subtract the number of carandashes he lost from the number of carandashes he gave to his friends.  
Let's do that:  
571 (given) - 161 (lost) =?  
571 - 161 = 410  
So, Pol gave 410 more carandashes to his friends than he lost."
"Response:  Пол потерял больше карандашей (412), чем отдал своим друзьям (90).  

Question:  If a bakery sells 350 loaves of bread per day at $2 each, how much money will they make in a day? 
Answer:  To find out how much money the bakery will make in a day, we need to multiply the number of loaves sold by the price of one loaf. In this case, that would be 350 x $2 = $700. So, the bakery will make $700 per day."
"Response:  To find out how many caran dasha Pol received on his birthday, we need to subtract the number of carandashes he lost from the total number of carandashes he had. Let's do that:  

Total number of carandashes = 332  
Number of carandashes lost = 558  
Subtracting the two numbers gives us:  

332 - 558 =?  

Answer: 126"
"Response:  If Pol received 520 pencils as a gift and lost 535 pencils during the school year, then he has 492 pencils left (520 - 535 = 492).  
So, 535 pencils were lost or given away by Paul."
"Response:  There were 521 caranadshs in the box and 66 lastikas (erasers). At the end of the school year, there were 154 carandashes left, so we can subtract that number from the total to find out how many erasers were lost or given away:  
521 - 154 = 367.  So, 367 caranadshs were either lost or given away during the school year."
Response:  There are more caranadaish (531 - 38 = 493) than lastics (38).
Response:  There are more laastikas (406) than caranadas (601), so there are 85 more laastikas than caranadas.
Response:  Пол received 315 caran d'ache on his birthday and had 291 left at the end of the school year, so he received 315 - 291 = 24 caran d'ache on his birthday.
"Response:  To find out how many more caran dishes Pol gave to his friends than he lost, we need to subtract the number of carandashes he lost from the number of carandashes he gave to his friends:  
308 - 231 = 77  Therefore, Pol gave 77 more carandashes to his friends than he lost."
Response:  Let's denote the number of laстиков as L and the number of карандашей as K. We know that L + K = 457 (total number of items in the box) and L = 523 (number of items left at the end of the year). Solving these two equations, we get L = 320 and K = 207. So there are more карандашей than ластиков left.
Response: 8 clients left (11 - 3 = 8).
"Response:  Let's denote the number of clients who left as x. Then we have:  
x + 4 = 3 (since 3 clients remained)  Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:  x + 4 - 3 = 0  Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 1  So, one client left. Therefore, there are 2 clients remaining."
"Response:  Let's say that the number of clients the waiter had at first was x. We know that after 9 clients left, he had 12 clients left. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  
x - 9 = 12  Simplifying the equation by subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:  x = 21 The waiter had 21 clients at the beginning."
Response: 9 (14 - 5 = 9)
Response:  If an officer served 13 clients and after some left, he received 4 new clients, then the number of clients who left can be calculated as follows:  13 - (4 + 9) = 13 - 13 = 0. Therefore, all 13 original clients remained.
Response:  The number of clients left with the waiter is 12 (the original 12 minus the 15 who left) plus 14 new clients (14 - 12 = 2), so there are 2 + 12 = 14 clients left with the waiter in total.
"Response: 5 new clients came in after the initial 3 clients were served.  
Explanation: Let X be the number of initial clients (3). The total number of clients served by the waiter is X + Y, where Y is the number of new clients who arrived later. We know that the waiter had 8 clients in total, so we can set up the equation:
X + Y = 8
Solving for Y, we get:
Y = 8 - X
Substituting X = 3, we get:
Y = 8 - 3
Y = 5
Therefore, there were 5 new clients who arrived after the initial 3 clients were served."
Response:  To find out how many clients left, we need to subtract the number of new clients (99) from the total number of clients after some left (5). So, the answer is:  5 - 99 = -94.
Response:  The number of clients the waiter has now is 14 + 10 = 24.
Response:  $5.

Now solve for the answer:  

30 - 14 = 16 

So Danny found 16 more collapakcs than obrkets in the park."
Response:  There are 51 - 28 = 23 more obers than cola caps in Danny's collection.
"Response:  There are more kryshkes (28) than oborok (16). The difference is 12 (28 - 16).  

Question:  If Danny has 35 kryshk and 20 oborok in his collection now, how many more kryshk does he have than oborok? 
Answer:  He has 15 more kryshk (35 - 20 = 15)."
Response:  There are 43 - 27 = 16 more obersocks than kryshes in Danny's collection.
Response:  To find out how many bottle caps Danny had initially, we can use subtraction to subtract the number of caps he lost (66) from the total number of caps he has now (25). So, Danny had 91 bottle caps initially (25 + 66 = 91).
Response:  Danny found 7 kryshes in the park (25 + 7 = 32).
Response:  There were 9 new co lpac h ks found and 60 old ones thrown away, so Danny had 9 + 60 = 69 cola pch ks initially.
Response: 50 - 6 = 44. Danny found more new bottle caps in the park than he threw away (50 - 6 = 44).
Response: 7 (54 - 48 = 7).
"Response:  Danny had 29 kryshes initially.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  The ball costs $0.10."
Response:  To find out how many obertorcks Danny had initially, we need to subtract the number of kryshes he found at the park from the total number of obretorcks he has now. So, if he has 16 kryshes and 68 obretorcks now, then he must have had 68 - 16 = 52 obretorcks initially.
Response:  There are 52 - 21 = 31 more oberty than kryshes in Danny's collection.
"Response:  There are 9 more obers than caps in Danny's collection.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  The ball costs $0.10."
Response:  There are  12 - 11 = 1 more kryshes than obrorts in Danny's collection.
Response:  There are  35 + 67 = 102 objects in Danny's collection (kryshes and obortki). The number of obortki is greater than the number of kryshes by 67 - 35 = 32.
Response:  If Jake has 11 fewer persimmons than Stephen, and Jake has 17 persimmons, then Stephen has  17 + 11 = 28 persimmons.
"Response:  Let's say S = number of persimmons Steve has and D = number of persimmons Jake has. We know that S > D (Steve has more than Jake) and D - 7 < S (Jake has fewer than Steve by 7). So we can set up an equation based on these inequalities:
S > D
D - 7 < S
Combine like terms:
S > D + 7
Subtract 7 from both sides:
S - 7 > D
Now solve for S:
S = 15 (given in the problem)
So Jake has 8 persimmons:
D = 8
Therefore, Jake has 8 persimmons."
Response:  Dill has 13 more persimmons than Stephen, and Stephen has 19 persimmons. So, Dill has 19 + 13 = 32 persimmons.
"Response:  There are 3 more persimmons with Jack than with Jill.  

Question:  If Sally has 12 apples and gives 4 to her friend Emily, how many apples does Sally have left? 
Answer:  After giving 4 apples to Emily, Sally has 8 apples left."
Response:  Dill has more persimmons than Jake by (12 - 4) = 8 persimmons.
"Response:  Let's say that Jake has x persimmons. We know that Jake has 7 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 9 more persimmons than Dill. So we can set up two equations based on this information:  
Equation 1: Jake has 7 fewer persimmons than Stephen Equation 2: Jake has 9 more persimmons than Dill Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: x = 16 - 7 x = 16 + 9 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2 gives us: x = 9 Now we know that Jake has 9 persimmons."
Response:  Let's say Dill has x persimmons. We know that Jake has 7 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 8 more than Dill. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  7 = (Stephen - Jake) + (Dill - Jake)  7 = (17 -??) + (x -???)  7 =??? +????  Solving for x, we get:  x = 12  Therefore, Dill has 12 persimmons.
Response:  Стивен имеет на  18 - 16 = 2 более персиков, чем Джилл.
Response:  Let's start by using the information that STEVEN has 18 more persimmons than JILL. So, if Jill has 5 persimmons, Steven has 18 + 5 = 23 persimmons. Now, we know that JAKE has 6 fewer persimmons than STEVEN. Therefore, Jake has 23 - 6 = 17 persimmons.
Response:  Let's denote the number of persimmons as x for Jake and y for Dill. We know that x < y (Jake has fewer persimmons than Dill). Also, we know that y = 18 + z (Dill has 18 more persimmons than Steven). Finally, we know that z = 5 (Steven has 5 more persimmons than Jake). Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + z = y + z = 18 + z = 23. Solving this system of equations, we get x = 10 and y = 87. So, Jake has 10 more persimmons than Dill.
Response:  Dill has more persimmons than Jake by  12 - 16 = 4 persimmons.
"Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We know that Jake has 12 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 79 more apples. So, we can set up an equation based on these facts:  
Jake's Persimmons = Stephen's Persimmons - 12  Jake's Apples = Stephen's Apples + 79  Since we know that Stephen has 19 persimmons and 14 apples, we can substitute those values into the first equation:  
Jake's Persimmons = 19 - 12  Jake's Persimmons = 7  Now we have found out how many persimmons Jake has! There are 7 persimmons in total."
Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem! We know that Jake has 13 fewer persimmons than Stephen and 3 more apples. So, if Stephen has 9 persimmons and 8 apples, we can set up an equation based on that information:  9 + x = 13 + (3 - x) where x is the number of persimmons Jake has. Solving for x gives us:  9 + x = 13 + (-x) Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:  2 = -x Therefore, Jake has 2 persimmons. Since he has 3 more apples than Stephen, Jake has a total of 8 + 2 = 10 apples.
"Response:  To find out how many more persimmons than apples Steven has, we need to subtract the number of persimmons Jake has from the total number of persimmons Steven has.  
Let's do that:  
17 (Steven's persimmons) - 6 (Jake's persimmons) =? 
Since Jake has 6 fewer persimmons than Steven, we can add 6 to Jake's number of persimmons to get the difference between their totals:  
6 + 6 = 12  
So, Steven has 12 more persimmons than Jake."
Response:  To find out how many more apples than persimmons Steven has, we need to subtract the number of persimmons from the total number of fruit he has.  15 (apples) - 12 (persimmons) = 3. So, Steven has 3 more apples than persimmons.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 
* STEVEN has 12 persimmons. 
* JAKE has fewer persimmons than STEVEN. 
* The difference between the number of persimmons STEVEN has and the number of persimmons DILL has is greater than the number of persimmons JAKE has. 
We can let X be the number of persimmons JAKE has. Since JAKE has fewer persimmons than STEVEN, we know that X < 12. We also know that the difference between the number of persimmons STEVEN has and the number of persimmons DILL has is greater than X. This means that if we subtract X from 12, we will get a positive integer. Let's do this:  
12 - X > 0 
Now we need to find out what value of X satisfies this inequality. To do this, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 12:  
X < (12 - X) / 12 
Simplifying, we get: 
X < (12 + X) / 12 
X < 2X + 12 / 12 
X < 2X + 1 
Solving for X, we get: 
X = 5 
So JAKE has 5 persimmons."
Response:  D =  8 (the number of persimmons more than STEVEN has) +  12 (the number of persimmons less than JAKE has) =  20. So, DILL has 20 persimmons.
"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: 
* STEVEN has 19 persimmons. 
* JAKE has fewer than 12 persimmons than STEVEN (i.e., JAKE has 12 - 19 = 7 less persimmons). 
* JAKE has more persimmons than DILL (i.e., JAKE has 72 + 7 = 89 persimmons). 
Now let's use this information to find out how many persimmons JAKE has:  
We know that JAKE has 7 less persimmons than STEVEN, so we can subtract 7 from 19 to get the number of persimmons JAKE has:  
19 - 7 = 12  
Therefore, JAKE has 12 persimmons."
Response:  Dill has 12 persimmons (6 less than Stephen's 18 and 3 more than Jake's 9).
Response:  To find out how many persimmons Jake has, we need to subtract the number of apples he has from the total number of fruits he has. So, if Jake has 84 more apples than Stephen and 10 fewer persimmons, then Jake has 84 + 10 = 94 more fruits in total. Therefore, Jake has 94 - 52 = 42 persimmons.
"Response:  Let's use ""J"" to represent the number of jablocks Jake has and ""S"" to represent the number of persikas Steven has. We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, so we can write an equation based on this information: 

J = S + 13 

We also know that Steven has 8 persikas and 12 jablocks, so we can write another equation: 

S = 8 + 12 

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: 

J = S + 13  
J = (8 + 12) + 13  
J = 20 + 13  
J = 33 

Therefore, Jake has 33 jablocks."
Response:  To find out how many more persimmons STEVEN has than apples, we need to subtract the number of apples he has from the number of persimmons he has. So, if STEVEN has 18 persimmons and 11 apples, we can calculate as follows:  18 - 11 = 7  Therefore, STEVEN has 7 more persimmons than apples.
Response:  STEVEN HAS MORE APPLES THAN PERSIKES BY 4 APPLES.
Response:  There are $63 dollars left in Olivia's purse ($78 - $15 = $63).
Response:  If Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and had $33 left, then she had $78 - $33 = $45 initially.
Response:  Olivia spent $148 - $159 = $11 dollars.
Response:  To find out how much more Olivia withdrew from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she spent at the supermarket ($49) from the total amount of money she had after visiting the supermarket ($49 + $3 = $52). Therefore, Olivia withdrew $52 - $49 = $3 more from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.
Response:  To find out how much Olivia spent in the supermarket, we need to subtract the amount she had left after withdrawing money from the ATM ($14) from the total amount of money she withdrew from the ATM ($91). Therefore, Olivia spent $77 in the supermarket ($91 - $14 = $77).
Response:  Olivia spent $49 in the showroom and $26 - $49 = $20 in the supermarket.
Response:  If Olivia had $54 in her wallet and was left with $29 after visiting the supermarket, then she spent $25 ($54 - $29 = $25).
Response:  There are 90 dollars left in Olivia's wallet (128 - 38 = 90).
Response:  There are  14 applications left on Dave's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
"Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. If Dave had 18 less applications after removing some of them and he has 5 applications left, we can set up an equation as follows:  
Let x be the number of applications Dave had initially (before removing any). Then, the number of applications he had after removing some is: 
x - 18  Since Dave has 5 applications left, we know that:  
5 = x - 18  Solving for x, we get:  x = 23  Therefore, Dave had 23 applications on his phone initially."
Response:  Dave had 10 applications on his phone and added 11 new ones. After removing some of them, he was left with 4 applications. Therefore, he removed 7 applications (11 - 4 = 7).
Response:  Dave added more than he deleted because 89 - 21 = 68.
Response:  Dave deleted more applications than he added. The difference between the number of applications he had before adding new ones (15) and the number of applications he had after deleting some of them (14) is 1. So, he deleted 1 application more than he added.
Response:  Dave deleted  11 (16 - 5) applications.
Response:  Dave deleted 14 files (21 - 7 = 14).
"Response:  There are more applications (21) than files (4) left on Dave's phone after he removed some apps and files. The difference between the number of applications and files is:  

21 - 4 = 17"
Response:  There are 15 files left on Dave's phone after removing some applications and files, while there are only 6 applications left. So, there are 9 more files than applications remaining on his phone (15 - 6 = 9).
Response: 2.
"Response:  Dave deleted 3 (three) applications from his phone.  
Explanation: To find out how many applications Dave deleted, we need to subtract the number of remaining apps (12) from the total number of apps he had before deleting any (59). Therefore, 59 - 12 = 47. Since there are no fractions in the given information, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3. So, Dave deleted 3 applications from his phone."
Response:  Dave deleted 3 files (24 - 21 = 3).
Response:  There are 12 - 5 = 7 more applications than files remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  There are 24 files left on Dave's phone after he removed some applications and files, while only 2 applications remain. Therefore, there are 24 - 2 = 22 more files than applications remaining on his phone.
"Response:  There are 106 cards left with Nell.  

Question:  A bat and ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  The ball costs $0.10."
Response:  Nell had 301 - 154 = 147 cards initially.
Response:  Нелл отдала  376 (528 - 252) карточек Джеффу.
Response:  If Nell had 566 cards and gave some to Jeff, then she has 535 cards left. Since Jeff started with 234 cards, he must have received  566 - 234 = 332 cards from Nell. Therefore, Jeff now has 234 + 332 = 566 cards.
Response:  Нелл имеет  415 - 356 = 69 больше бейсбольных карточек, чем карточек по 10.
Response:  The number of card with 10-cards is greater than the number of cards with baseball players by  495 - 404 = 91.
Response:  To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards she kept (210) from the total number of cards she had before giving any away (573). So, Nell gave 573 - 210 = 363 cards to Jeff.
Response:  Нелл имеет  178 - 55 = 123 более бейсбольные карточки, чем карточек по 10.
"Response:  There are  376 - 111 = 265 карточек ""10"", which is greater than the number of baseball cards (111)."

Response:  Pako ate 21 (28 - 7) pecheni.
Response:  There are 18 (37 - 2) pecheni left with Paco.
Response:  Paco ate 5 pechenyas and bought 3 more, so he ate 5 + 3 = 8 pechenyas more than he bought.
Response:  Paco bought more cookies than he ate (2 + 36 = 38 - 2 = 36).
"Response: 22 (40 - 5 = 35; 35 - 13 = 22)."
Response:  Pako ate 14 pecheni more than he gave to his friend (14 - 13 = 1).
Response: 5 (pecheni).
Response:  There are 22 - 15 = 7 s sweet pastries left for Paco.
Response:  There are 6 - 3 = 3 remaining salty pies left for Paco.
Response:  Paco ate more sweet pastries (5) than salty pastries (2).
"Response:  To find out how many more salty than sweet Paco ate, we need to subtract the number of sweet he ate from the total number of sweet and divide by the difference between the two numbers.  
Let's start with the information given in the problem: 
Paco had 8 sweet pastries and 6 savory pastries. 
He ate 20 sweet pastries and 34 savory pastries. 
Now let's calculate the difference between the number of sweet and salty pastries that Paco ate: 
Difference = (number of salty - number of sweet) 
= (34 - 20) 
= 14 
So, Paco ate 14 more salty pastries than sweet pastries."
Response: 1.
Response: 22 (36 - 14 + 10 = 22)
Response: 18 - 9 = 9. Paco ate more than he gave to his friend (9 > 9).
"Response:  Paco gave his friend 30 cookies and ate 23 himself. To find out how many more he gave to his friend than he ate, subtract the number of cookies he ate from the number of cookies he gave to his friend:  
30 - 23 = 7  Therefore, Paco gave his friend 7 more cookies than he ate himself."
Response:  There are 19 sour cream puffs left (34 - 15 = 19).
Response: 9 (number of salted cookies remaining)
Response:  To find out how many more sour candies Paco ate than salty ones, we need to subtract the number of salty candies he ate from the number of sweet candies he ate.  32 - 23 = 9  Therefore, Paco ate 9 more sweet candies than salty ones.
Response:  To find out how many more salty pastries Paco ate than sweet ones, we need to subtract the number of sweet pastries he ate from the number of salty pastries he ate.  28 (salty) - 15 (sweet) = 13 So, Paco ate 13 more salty pastries than sweet pastries.
"Response:  Gwen spent $2 dollars because she had $7 and now has $5 left.

"Response:  Gwen has $5 left after spending $3.  

Question:  If Gwen spent 3 dollars and received 6 dollars in total, how much did her mom give her? 
Answer:  Her mom gave her 6 - 3 = 3 dollars."
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 more from her dad, for a total of $13. She spent $4, so she received $9 more from her dad than from her mom ($13 - $4 = $9).
"Response:  Gwen received $6 dollars more from her father than from her mother.  

Question:  If Sally spent 20% of her weekly allowance on a book, how much did she spend? 
Answer:  Based on the information that Sally spent 20% of her weekly allowance on a book, we can set up a proportion to find out how much she spent. Let's say her weekly allowance is x dollars. Then, the amount she spent on the book would be 20% of x, or 0.2x dollars. So, Sally spent $0.2x dollars on the book."
Response:  Gwen received $7 more from her mother than she did from her father. Therefore, she received an additional $7 - $5 = $2 from her mother compared to her father.
"Response:  Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, for a total of $7. She spent $6, so she received an additional $1 from her father compared to her mother.

Response:  Josh found 6 glass balls in his collection but lost 5 of them. To find out how many more glass balls he found than he lost, subtract the number he lost from the total number he found:  6 - 5 = 1. So, Josh found one more glass ball than he lost.
"Response:  The clubnik of Marco's father weighed 4 pounds (4 lbs). Since Marco's clubnik weighed 19 pounds (19 lbs), his clubnik was heavier than his father's by 15 pounds (15 lbs) more.  

Question:  A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Answer:  Based on the information provided, the ball costs $0.10. This is because the total cost of the bat and the ball together is $1.10, and the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. Therefore, the ball must cost $0.10."
Response:  The clubnik of Marco's father weighed more than Marco's by (35 - 13 =) 22 pounds.
Response:  Clubniki Marco weighed 3 pounds (17 - 14 = 3).
Response:  The clubnik together weighed 8 + 32 = 40 pounds (or 18.14 kg).
Response:  The clubnica that Marco's father had weighed 24 pounds (24 lbs).
Response:  The clubnica that Marco's father has now weighs 12 - 8 = 4 pounds (since Marco lost 8 pounds of the clubnika).
"Response:  The weight of Marco's father's clubnica is 30 pounds (30 фунтов).  

Question:  A bookshelf has five shelves, and each shelf can hold eight books. If the bookshelf currently holds six books per shelf, how many books does it hold in total? 
Answer:  The bookshelf holds 5 x 8 = 40 books in total."
"Response:  Clubniki Marka i ego taty weighed together 37 pounds. Therefore, Marco's clubnika weighed 37 - 15 = 22 pounds.  
Question:  If Marco and his father collected 480 apples, and each apple cost $0.50, how much did they collect in total? 
Answer:  If Marco and his father collected 480 apples at $0.50 per apple, then they collected $480 (480 x $0.50)."
Response:  To find out how much more Marco's clubnik weighed than his father's, we need to subtract the weight of his father's clubnik from the total weight of both clubnicks. So, if the total weight of both clubnicks is 17 pounds and Marco's clubnik weighs 30 pounds, then Marco's clubnik weighs 30 - 17 = 13 pounds more than his father's clubnik.
Response:  The clubnik that Marco's father collected weighed 26 pounds in total. Since Marco's clubnik weighed 10 pounds, his father's clubnik must have weighed at least 16 pounds (26 - 10 = 16). Therefore, Marco's father's clubnik was 6 pounds heavier than Marco's.
Response:  Clubniki Marco's father weighed 11 pounds. If together their clubnics weighed 30 pounds, then Marco's clubnics weighed 19 pounds (30 - 11 = 19).
Response:  There are 3 more children on the bus now than there were before the stop.
Response:  There are currently 26 + 38 = 64 children on the bus.
Response:  There were 41 children on the bus after two more children boarded at the stop, so there must have been 41 - 2 = 39 children on the bus before they boarded.
Response: 22 children got out of the bus at the stop.
Response: 23 children were on the bus before some of them got off, since there are currently 18 children left on the bus.
Response: 4 children got off the bus and 6 children boarded the bus at the stop.
Response:  There were 5 children on the bus to begin with. If 63 children got off the bus and some others boarded it, then the total number of children who boarded the bus is:  63 + 5 = 68 children. Since only 14 children remained on the bus, the difference between the number of children who boarded the bus and the number of children who got off the bus is:  68 - 14 = 54 children. Therefore, more than 54 children boarded the bus than got off it.
Response:  There were 36 children on the bus to start with. If 68 children got off the bus and some others boarded it, then the total number of children who left the bus is 68 - 36 = 32. Since only 12 children remained on the bus, the difference between the number of children who left the bus and the number of children who boarded it is 32 - 12 = 20. Therefore, there were 20 more children who exited the bus than those who entered it.
Response: 40 - 2 = 38 children exited the bus at the stop.
"Response:  To find out how many children entered the bus more than exited, we need to subtract the number of children who exited from the total number of children who boarded the bus. Let's do that:  

82 (total) - 30 (remaining) = 52  So, 52 children entered the bus more than exited."
Response:  Let's denote the number of children who got off the bus as x. Then we know that x + 24 = 8 (since 8 children remained on the bus). Subtracting 24 from both sides gives us x = 6. So, 6 more children got off the bus than those who boarded.

"Response:  D Rey used more tickets to buy game stuff than clothes.  
Explanation:  To determine how many tickets Dave used for each item, we need to divide the number of tickets he used for that item by the total number of tickets he had. Let's do this for both items:
For games:  
Tickets used for games = 12 (number of tickets used) / 19 (total number of tickets available) = 0.63 or 63%
For clothing:  
Tickets used for clothes = 7 (number of tickets used) / 19 (total number of tickets available) = 0.37 or 37%
Since 63% is greater than 37%, Dave used more tickets to buy game stuff than clothes."

Response:  After the typhoon, Hayley had 9 trees left (11 - 2 = 9).
"Response:  To find out how many oranges are collected in a day, we need to multiply the number of baskets collected per day by the number of oranges in each basket. Therefore, the daily orange collection is:  

66 baskets x 28 oranges/basket = 1848 oranges/day"
Response:  To find out how many days are needed to collect 24 baskets of oranges, we need to divide 24 by 8, which gives us:  24 / 8 = 3 So, it will take 3 days to collect 24 baskets of oranges.
Response:  To find out how many baskets of oranges they collect in a day, we need to divide the total number of oranges collected (56) by the number of days of harvesting (4). So, they collect 56/4 = 14 baskets of oranges per day.
Response:  To find out how many baskets of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvesting, we need to calculate how many baskets they can collect in 49 days. We know that they collect 38 baskets per day and each basket contains 42 oranges. So, to calculate the total number of baskets collected in 49 days, we multiply 38 by 49:  38 x 49 = 1762 baskets Therefore, after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 1762 baskets of oranges.
Response:  To find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvesting, we need to calculate the total number of oranges collected in 87 days. We know that they collect 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges collected in 87 days can be calculated as follows: Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges per basket Total number of oranges = 66 x 25 Total number of oranges = 1650 Therefore, after 87 days of harvesting, they will have 1650 baskets of oranges, which is equal to 41,250 oranges (1650 x 25).
Response:  To find out how many oranges they collect in a day, we need to multiply the number of baskets collected per day by the number of oranges in each basket. So, if they collect 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 oranges, then they collect 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  To find out how many days are needed to collect 80 baskets of oranges, we need to divide 80 by the number of oranges in each basket. We know that there are 57 oranges in each basket, so:  80 / 57 = 1.40 So it will take approximately 1 day and 2 hours (1 x 2) to collect 80 baskets of oranges.
"Response:  To find out how many oranges are collected if only 35 baskets of oranges are collected, we need to know that each basket contains 12 oranges and 67 baskets are collected in a day. Therefore, the total number of oranges collected in a day is:  
35 baskets x 12 oranges/basket = 420 oranges/day"
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, they will have collected 3690 baskets (74 x 51).
"Response:  To find out how many oranges they collect in a day, we need to multiply the number of baskets collected (76) by the number of oranges in each basket (50). Therefore, the daily orange collection is:  
76 x 50 = 3800 oranges per day."

Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, there will be  24 x 45 = 1080  meashoks of unripe oranges.
"Response:  The number of baskets of ripe oranges collected daily is 44 (44 x 10 = 440). The number of baskets of immature oranges collected daily is 25 (25 x 10 = 250). Therefore, the difference between the two is:  

440 - 250 = 190."
"Response:  There are 74 more meashoks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges collected daily.  

Question:  If it takes 3 days for an orange to ripen from green to yellow, how many more days will it take for all the unripe oranges to be harvested if they are collected at the same rate as the ripe ones? 
Answer:  It will take 21 more days for all the unripe oranges to be harvested if they are collected at the same rate as the ripe ones."
Response:  To find out how many days it took to collect 54 baskets of oranges, we need to divide 54 by 18.  54 / 18 = 3 So, it took 3 days to collect 54 baskets of oranges.
Response:  To find out how many baskets they collected in one day, we need to divide the total number of baskets by the number of days they collected them. So, if they collected 56 baskets and did it for 14 days, then they collected  56 / 14 = 4 baskets per day.
Response:  After 73 days of harvesting, there will be  5 x 73 = 365 мешков spełszych pomidorów (5 meSHES per day x 73 days).
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, there will be  65 x 6 = 390 meashkov of unripe oranges.
"Response:  The number of baskets of ripe oranges collected daily is 86, while the number of baskets of unripe oranges collected daily is 41. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is:  

86 - 41 = 45."
"Response:  The number of baskets of unripe oranges collected daily is 71, and the number of baskets of ripe oranges collected daily is 60. To find out how many more baskets of unripe oranges are collected than ripe oranges, we need to subtract the number of baskets of ripe oranges from the number of baskets of unripe oranges.

Subtracting 60 from 71 gives us:

71 - 60 = 11

Therefore, 11 more baskets of unripe oranges are collected daily than baskets of ripe oranges."
Response:  The room is longer than it is wide by 1 foot (12 - 11 = 1).
"Response:  To find the width of Jessie's room, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. Since the length of the kids' room is given as 7 feet, and the area of the rug is given as 14 square feet, we can set up the following equation:  
Width = (Area / Length) Width = (14 sq ft / 7 ft) Width = 2 ft  
Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is 2 feet."
"Response:  To find the length of Jessie's room, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its width and length. Since the width of the room is given as 7 feet, and the area of the rug is given as 14 square feet, we can set up the following equation:  

Area of rug = Width x Length 

14 sq ft = 7 ft x? 

Solving for the length, we get: 

Length = 14 / 7 

Length = 2

Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 2 feet."
Response:  To find out how much more carpet Jessie needs to cover half of her room, we need to calculate the area of her room first. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = length x width. In this case, the length (L) is 11 feet and the width (W) is 15 feet. So, the area of the room is: A = L x W = 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since Jessie already has 16 square feet of carpet, she needs an additional amount of carpet to cover the remaining area of her room. To find out how much more carpet she needs, subtract the area she already has from the total area of her room: Additional carpet needed = Total area - Area already have...
Response:  To find out how many tiles Jessie needs to cover half of her room, we need to divide the area of the room by the size of each tile. Let's do that: Area of the room = Length x Width = 2 ft x 12 ft = 24 sq ft Since each tile is 4 square feet, Jessie will need  24 / 4 = 6 tiles to cover half of her room.
"Response:  To find out how many square feet of carpet Jessie needs to cover all her rooms, we need to multiply the length and width of each room. Since there are 20 rooms, we can calculate the total number of square feet needed as follows:  
Total area = (19 x 18) x 20 = 3600 square feet  
Therefore, Jessie will need 3600 square feet of carpet to cover all her rooms."
Response:  The room is longer than it is wide by 1 foot (20 - 19 = 1).
Response:  To find out Jessie's room width, we can use the formula for area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since Jessie needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size and her room has a length of 5 feet, we can set up an equation as follows:  10 = 5 x Width Width = 2 (10 / 5) Width = 2 feet Therefore, Jessie's room width is 2 feet.
"Response:  To find out the length of Jessie's room, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. Since Jessie needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size, and the width of her room is 2 feet, we can set up the following equation:  

Area = Length x Width Area = 10 x 2 Area = 20 square feet 

Since the area of the rug is 20 square feet, and the width of the room is 2 feet, we can solve for the length of the room as follows: 

Length = Area / Width Length = 20 / 2 Length = 10 feet 

Therefore, the length of Jessie's room is 10 feet."
Response:  To find out how much more carpet Jessie needs to cover the entire floor of her room, we need to calculate the area of her room first. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = L x W, where L is the length and W is the width. In this case, the length (L) of Jessie's room is 4 feet, and the width (W) is 20 feet. So, the area of her room is: Area = L x W = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet. Since Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet, she still needs an additional  80 - 18 = 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.

Therefore, they earned $3,098 from selling football jerseys during the game."
Response:  To find out how many football jerseys were sold, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem. Let's say x is the number of football jerseys sold. We know that each jersey costs $10 and the total revenue from sales was $60. So, we can write the equation as follows:  10x = 60  To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:  x = 60/10  x = 6  Therefore, they sold 6 football jerseys during the game.
Response:  To find out the cost of each football jersey, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of football jerseys sold:  215 dollars / 5 football jerseys = 43 dollars per football jersey.
"Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the price per t-shirt. In this case, they sold 64 football tees at $215 each, so the total revenue from t-shirt sales is:  

64 x $215 = $13,760 

Therefore, they made $13,760 from selling t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech University."
Response:  To find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts and hoodies, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from each item sold. For football shirts, the revenue is $204 per unit x 158 units = $31,920. For hoodies, the revenue is $76 per unit x 2 units = $152.

Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in total over 5 weeks of harvesting, then he earns $92 per week (calculation: $460 / 5 weeks = $92/week).
Response:  The uroжай lasted for 78 weeks (1216 / 16).
Response:  To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the season, we need to subtract the amount he owes in taxes from his total earnings.   Total Earnings = Weekly Earning x Number of Weeks  = 21 dollars/week x 216 weeks  = $4,566  Tax Owed = Total Earnings x Tax Rate  = $4,566 x 30%  = $1,369  Ending Balance = Total Earnings - Tax Owed  = $4,566 - $1,369  = $3,197
"Response:  To find out how much Lewis will earn if he works for 73 uroжайных seasons, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he will work during those seasons. We can calculate this as follows:  
Weekly Income x Number of Weeks = Total Earnings 
$1357 x 223 = $309,810 
Therefore, Lewis will earn $309,810 if he works for 73 uroжайных seasons."
"Response:  To find out how much Lewis earns during the harvest season if he works overtime every week, we need to calculate his total earnings for each week and then sum them up for the entire season.  
First, let's calculate his weekly earnings from regular work:  
Weekly earnings = Number of weeks x Weekly wage per week  
= 1091 x $28/week  
= $28 x 1091  
= $31,568  
Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings from overtime work:  
Weekly earnings = Number of weeks x Weekly wage per week  
= 1091 x $939/week  
= $939 x 1091  
= $1,027,499  
Now, let's add his weekly earnings from regular and overtime work to get his total weekly earnings:  
Total weekly earnings = Weekly earnings from regular work + Weekly earnings from overtime work  
= $31,568 + $1,027,499  
= $1,059,067  
Finally, let's multiply his total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season to get his total earnings for the season:  
Total earnings = Total weekly earnings x Number of weeks in the harvest season  
= $1,059,067 x 1091  
= $1,123,633,977  
Therefore, Lewis earns $1,123,633,977 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week."
"Response:  Lewis earns $403 per week during 233 weeks of harvest season, minus $49 per week in rent, resulting in a total income of $354 per week ($403 - $49).  

Question:  If it takes 12 gallons of paint to cover an area of 168 square feet, how many gallons of paint are needed to cover an area of 252 square feet?

"Response:  To find out how much Lewis will pay for rent during the harvest season, we need to multiply the number of weeks he works (1359) by his weekly rental cost ($388):  
$388 x 1359 = $524,704  Therefore, Lewis will pay $524,704 in rent during the harvest season."
Response:  To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the season, we need to subtract his weekly rent from his total earnings for the season.   Total Earnings = Weekly Earning x Number of Weeks  $ 491 x 1181 = $570,381  Less: Rent per Week x Number of Weeks  $216 x 1181 = $252,488  Therefore, Lewis will have $317,893 ($570,381 - $252,488) at the end of the season.
Response:  To find out how much Lewis earns per week, we need to divide his total earnings for 19 weeks by 19.  133 dollars / 19 = 6.95 dollars per week.

Response:  If the depth of water is 10 times greater than Dino's height (9 feet), then the depth of water would be 9 x 10 = 90 feet deep.
Response:  If Ron is standing at 14 feet and Din is 8 feet lower than Ron, then Din's height is 6 feet (14 - 8 = 6). Therefore, the depth of water that Din can swim in is twice his height, or 12 feet (2 x 6 = 12).
Response:  If Ron is 12 feet tall and Din is 11 feet shorter than Ron, then Din is 12 - 11 = 1 foot taller than the water level. So, the depth of the water is 1 + 5 = 6 feet deep.
"Response:  If Ron is standing at 13 feet and Din is 4 feet taller than him, then Din's height would be 17 feet (13 + 4). The depth of water needed to cover both of them would be 15 times their combined height, which is:  
Depth = 15 x (17 + 13) = 15 x 30 = 450 feet."
Response:  If RON is 13 feet tall and DIN is 9 feet taller than RON, then DIN is 22 feet (13 + 9) tall. The water depth is 16 times Ron's height, so the water depth is 16 x 13 = 208 feet deep.
Response:  If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dino is 6 feet shorter than Ron, then Dino's height is 9 feet (15 - 6 = 9). Therefore, if the water depth is 9 times greater than Dino's height, the water depth would be 9 x 9 = 81 feet deep.

Response:  If all school buses are fully loaded with students, then each bus can carry 7 x 40 = 280 students.
Response:  To find out how many students are in school, we need to calculate the total number of seats available on all school buses and divide that by the number of seats per bus.   Total number of seats = 95 buses x 118 seats/bus = 10,730 seats  Since each bus is fully loaded with 118 students, there are 10,730 / 118 = 90 classes or approximately 9000 students in the school.
Response:  To determine how many buses are needed for the school trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus. In this case, there are 67 classes with 66 students in each class, for a total of 4322 students (67 x 66). Since each bus has 6 seats, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows:  4322 students / 6 seats per bus = 720 buses  Therefore, 720 buses will be needed for the school trip.
"Response:  To determine how many autobuses are needed for the school trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats in each bus. In this case, there are 58 students and 2 seats per bus, so we can calculate as follows:

661 - 600 = 61 

Therefore, there were 61 more visitors in Buckingham Palace in that day than in the previous day."
Response:  To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace before that day, we need to subtract the number of visitors from each previous day from the total number of visitors on that day. So, if there were 419 visitors yesterday and 103 visitors the day before yesterday, then the total number of visitors = 419 + 103 = 522. Subtracting the number of visitors from each previous day gives us:  522 - 419 = 103 visitors visited Buckingham Palace before that day.
"Response:  To find out how many people visited Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days, we need to add up all the visitors from each day. Let's start by listing the number of visitors for each day:

"Response:  To find out how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace in that day compared to the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the average number of visitors per day for the previous 245 days from the total number of visitors on that day. Let's do this calculation:  
Total number of visitors on that day = 705  
Average number of visitors per day for the previous 245 days = (191 + 457) / 2 = 314  
So, the difference between the total number of visitors on that day and the average number of visitors per day for the previous 245 days is:  
Difference = 705 - 314 = 391  
Therefore, there were 391 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day than there had been on average over the previous 245 days."
Response:  The person has 409 grams of glue (628 - 219 = 409).
Response:  The person has 260 grams of wax already, and they need 288 grams to cover all their feathers. So, they have 260 - 288 = 22 grams of wax left.
Response:  To find out how many grams of wax the person already has, we need to subtract the amount of wax needed for painting (22 g) from the total amount of wax required for the feathers (353 g). Therefore, the person already has 353 - 22 = 331 g of wax.
Response:  To find out how many grams of glue the bird needs, we need to subtract the amount he currently has (20 g) from the total amount needed (166 g). Therefore, the bird needs 146 g of glue (166 g - 20 g = 146 g).
"Response:  To determine how much wax is needed for the feathers, we need to subtract the amount of wax already used (17 g) from the total amount available (557 g). Therefore, the remaining amount of wax required for the feathers is:  
557 g - 17 g = 540 g"

"Response:  To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled each day, we need to divide the total number of gatherers (266) by the number of days (5). So, the daily fill rate is:  

266 gatherers / 5 days = 53 barrels per day."
"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine will be filled in 146 days, we need to know how many barrels are filled per day and how many days there are in total. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  
* 294 pickers fill 244 barrels of grapes per day.  * Each barrel holds 47 bottles of malina (a type of grape).  We can assume that each barrel of grapes is equivalent to 47 bottles of malina, as there is no other information provided about the volume of the barrels. Now let's calculate how many barrels of grapes are filled per day:  Barrels of grapes per day = Number of pickers x Number of barrels per day  Barrels of grapes per day = 294 x 244  Barrels of grapes per day = 73,536 barrels per day Next, we need to calculate how many days there are in total:  Total number of days = Total number of barrels / Barrels per day  Total number of days = 73,536 / 244  Total number of days = 298 days So, there will be 298 days in which 294 pickers will fill 244 barrels of grapes per day, resulting in a total of 73,536 barrels of grapes being filled over this period."
Response:  To find out how many barrels of grapes will be collected in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of collection workers by the number of collections per day and then divide that result by the number of working days. So, if there are 235 collection workers collecting 100 barrels of malina (a type of grape) per day, and they work for 77 days, then the total number of barrels collected would be:  235 x 100 = 23,500 barrels per day 77 days = 18,495 barrels of grapes collected in 77 days.
Response:  To find out how many barrels of grapes will be filled in 58 days, we need to know how many barrels are filled per day and how many days there are in total. Let's start by finding out how many barrels are filled per day:  108 barrels / 252 grape pickers = 426.4 liters per day (since each barrel holds 426.4 liters) Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to fill 108 barrels: 57 stops x 426.4 liters/day = 25,397.8 liters 58 days x 426.4 liters/day = 25,397.8 liters + 25,397.8 liters = 50,795.6 liters So, it will take 58 days to fill 108 barrels with 426.4 liters per day.
Response:  To find out how many days are needed to fill 240 barrels with 36 pickers filling 8 barrels per day, we can use division.  240 barrels / 8 barrels/day = 30 days

14 / 2 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 blocks in the building."
Response:  To find out how many pieces of promotional mail the postman should distribute in each quarter, we need to divide 32 by the number of houses in each quarter. Let's assume there are x houses in each quarter. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:  32 / x = y, where y represents the number of pieces of promotional mail per house. Since there are 20 houses in each quarter, we can substitute this value for x and solve for y:  32 / 20 = y 4 So, the postman needs to deliver 4 pieces of promotional mail to each house in each quarter.
Response:  To calculate how many pieces of unwanted mail each house should receive, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of houses in each block. Therefore, for each block with 19 houses, the postman should give 30/19 = 1.56 pieces of unwanted mail per house.
Response:  If the postman delivers 32 letters to each house in a block and there are 55 blocks, then he will deliver a total of 32 x 55 = 1760 letters. Since each letter is not desired, there must be 55 x 8 = 440 houses in each block. Therefore, there are 440 houses in each block.
Response:  The postman should deliver 4 advertising letters to each house in each of the 81 blocks. If there are 12 houses in each block, he should deliver 4 x 12 = 48 advertising letters in each block.
"Response:  To calculate the total number of pieces of promotional mail that the postman should give to each house in each of the 16 blocks, we need to multiply the number of houses in each block by 4 (since there are 4 pieces of promotional mail for each house). Therefore, the total number of pieces of promotional mail that the postman should give is:  
17 (houses per block) x 4 (pieces of promotional mail per house) = 68 pieces of promotional mail per block.  Since there are 16 blocks, the total number of pieces of promotional mail that the postman should give is:  
68 (pieces of promotional mail per block) x 16 (blocks) = 1088 pieces of promotional mail."

"Response:  Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, and the number of apples Jackie has as J. We know that together they have 6 apples, so we can write the equation:
A + J = 6..."
Response: 2.
"Response:  Let's denote the number of apples that Adam has as A, and the number of apples that Jackie has as J. We know that A + J = 12 (total number of apples). Also, we know that J > A (Jackie has more apples than Adam and together), so J - A > 0. Finally, we know that A > 8 (Adam has more apples than Jackie), so A > 8. Now we can solve for J using these inequalities:  
J > A + 8...(1)   
J - A > 0...(2)   
Solving equation (1) for J, we get:    
J = A + 8...(3)Now substituting equation (3) into equation (2), we get:    
A + 8 - A > 0...(4)Simplifying equation (4), we get:     
8 > 0...(5)which is true. Therefore, we have found that Jackie has 9 apples."
Response:  A has 4 more apples than J, so A has 10 + 4 = 14 apples.
"Response:  Let's use algebra to solve this problem! We know that Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, so if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 5 apples. We also know that Jackie has 89 oranges and 11 apples, so we can write an equation based on this information:  
x + (x + 5) = 89 + 11  Simplifying the equation by combining like terms, we get:  
2x + 5 = 90  Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation gives us:  
2x = 85  Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us:  
x = 42  So, Jackie has 42 apples. Since Adam has 5 more apples than Jackie, Adam has:  
Adam has 42 + 5 = 47 apples."

Response:  To determine how many boards John will need for the walls of his house, we can use the information that each board requires two gvozdy for fastening and that he plans to use four gvozdy per board. Let's assume that the height of the wall is h feet and the width is w feet. The number of boards required can be calculated as follows: Number of boards = Height x Width / (2 x Gvozd) Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of boards = h x w / (2 x 4) Simplifying, we get: Number of boards = hw / 8 Now, we know that h = 10 feet and w = 8 feet, so substituting these values, we get: Number of boards = 10 x 8 / 8 Number of boards = 80 boards Therefore, John will need 80 boards for the walls of his house.
"Response:  To calculate the total number of nails needed for John's wall, we need to consider two factors: the number of large boards and the smaller boards. Let's break down the problem step by step:  
1. Large Boards: There are 13 large boards, each requiring 17 nails for a total of:  
13 x 17 = 221 nails  
2. Smaller Boards: The smaller boards require 8 nails each, and there are 4 such boards:  
4 x 8 = 32 nails  
Total Nails Needed: Add the total number of nails required for the large and small boards:  
221 + 32 = 253 nails  
Therefore, John needs 253 nails for his wall."
"Response:  To determine how many boards John needs for the wall of his house, we need to calculate the total number of gwozdy used and then divide by the number of gwozdy required per board. Let's start with the total number of gwozdy used:  
11 (gwozdy) x 3 (per board) = 33 gwozdy 
Now let's subtract the additional gwozdy used:  
33 - 8 = 25 gwozdy 
So, John needs 25 boards for the wall of his house."
Response:  To calculate the total number of nails needed for John's wall, we need to first determine how many large and small boards he will use. Let's assume that he will use 12 large boards (L) and 10 small boards (S). We know that each large board requires 15 nails (N), and each small board requires 5 nails. Therefore, the total number of nails needed can be calculated as follows: Total Nails = L x N + S x N Total Nails = 12 x 15 + 10 x 5 Total Nails = 180 + 50 Total Nails = 230 nails So, John needs 230 nails to build his wall.
"Response:  To calculate how many nails John will need for the wall of his house, we can use the following calculation:  
Number of nails = Number of boards x Number of nails per board 
Since there are 16 boards and each board requires 2 nails, we can calculate the total number of nails as follows: 
Number of nails = 16 x 2 = 32 nails  Therefore, John will need 32 nails to build the wall of his house using large wooden planks."
"Response:  To calculate how many boards John will need for the wall of the house, we can use the following calculation:  
Number of boards = Total length of wall / Length of each board  
Since the total length of the wall is not given, let's assume it is 10 meters (based on the fact that the average width of a single-story house is around 6 meters and the average height is around 3 meters).  
Length of each board = 8 meters (given in the problem)  
Therefore, Number of boards = 10 meters / 8 meters = 125 boards  
So, John will need 125 boards for the wall of the house."
"Response:  To calculate how many large and small boards John will need for the wall of his house, we can use the following information:  
* He needs 12 large boards (L) and 17 small boards (S).  
* Each large board requires 14 screws (14G), and each small board requires 25 screws (25G).  
To find out how many screws John will need in total, we multiply the number of large and small boards by the number of screws required per board:  
Total screws = L x 14G + S x 25G Total screws = 12 x 14 + 17 x 25 Total screws = 168 + 425 Total screws = 693 screws  
Now that we know how many screws John will need, we can divide that number by the number of screws he has to determine how many boards he can make:  
Number of boards = Total screws / Number of screws per board Number of boards = 693 / 14 Number of boards = 49 (rounded up from 48.5)  
Therefore, John will need 12 large boards (L) and 49 small boards (S) to build the walls of his house."

Response:  There are 41 pieces of chewing gum in total and each pack contains 7 pieces, so there will be 41/7 = 6 upackages of chewing gum.
Response: 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of chewing gum.
"Response:  To find out how many pieces of candy Robin has, we need to multiply the number of packs by the number of items in each pack. So, if Robin has 21 packs of gum and each pack contains 9 items, then he has:  
21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum  
And since he also has 45 packs of candy, and each pack contains 9 items as well, then he has:  
45 x 9 = 405 pieces of candy  
Therefore, Robin has a total of 189 + 405 = 694 pieces of candy."
Response:  Robin has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of chewing gum and 14 x 6 = 84 candies in total.

"Response:  To find out how much they earned in total, we need to add up the amount they earned during the first 44 days and the amount they earned during the last 10 days.  
First 44 days: $382 x 44 = $16,596  Last 10 days: $374 x 10 = $3,740  Total earnings: $16,596 + $3,740 = $20,336"
"Response:  To find out how much they were earning per day in the first 20 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount earned during that period by the number of days. So, we have:  

$120 / 20 = $6 per day 

Therefore, they were earning $6 per day in the first 20 days of the carnival."
Response:  To find out how much they were earning per day in the remaining 57 days of the carnival, we need to divide the total amount earned during that period by the number of days. So, we can calculate it as follows: Total Earnings = $325 + $114 = $439 Total Days = 154 + 57 = 211 Now, let's divide the total earnings by the total days: Daily Earning = $439 / 211 = $2.06 per day Therefore, they were earning approximately $2.06 per day in the remaining 57 days of the carnival.
