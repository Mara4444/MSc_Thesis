"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 36 pokrovces for glasses in the park and threw away 35 of them. Therefore, he has 22 pokrovces left in his collection. To find out how many more pokrovces Danny found than he threw away, we subtract the number he threw away (35) from the total number he found (36): 36 - 35 = 1. So, Danny found 1 more pokrovce in the park than he threw away."

Response: 49 papers (17 + 30 - 22)
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 30 pokrovcev for glasses and 14 omelets in the park. This means he collected 30 + 14 = 44 items. Since he already had 7 pokrovcev for glasses at home, he now has 44 - 7 = 37 more pokrovcev for glasses than he started with. Therefore, Danny found 37 more pokrovcev for glasses in the park than he already had at home."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 28 ometov and 11 pokrovcev in the park. This means that he has 68 pokrovcev and 51 ometov in his collection now. To find out how many more ometov than pokrovcev Danny found, we subtract the number of pokrovcev he already had (68) from the total number of ometov he found (51): 51 - 68 = -17. Therefore, Danny found 39 more ometov than pokrovcev in the park."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny found 71 pokrovčkov and 24 ometov in the park. This means he collected 71 + 24 = 95 items. Then, he gave away 28 pokrovčkov and 16 ometov, leaving him with 95 - (28 + 16) = 39 items. Therefore, Danny has 39 more pokrovčkov than he had at first."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Danny had 66 pokrovcev for glasses at first and lost 41 of them (66 - 41 = 31). Therefore, he has 25 pokrovcev left in his collection."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 32 pokrovice in his collection after finding some more in the park. If he only had 25 pokrovice in his collection before going to the park, then the number of pokrovice he found in the park is equal to 32 - 25 = 9."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 40 pokrovcev at the beginning. This is because he started with 60 old pokrovcev and found 58 new ones, leaving him with 40 total (60 - 58 = 40)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 50 new covers for glasses in the park while he threw away 6 old ones. Therefore, he has 60 covers in his collection now. To find out how many more covers he found than he threw away, we subtract the number of old covers thrown away from the total number of new covers found: 60 - 6 = 54. So, Danny found 54 more covers in the park than he threw away."
Response: 16 more pokrovces were thrown away than found in the park.
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 30 pokrovčkov at the beginning of the story. This is mentioned in the sentence ""Zdaj ima v zbirki 42 pokrovcev za steklenice in 61 ometov,"" which means ""Now he has 42 covers for glasses and 61 stickers."""
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 40 pieces of paper at the beginning. This is evident from the fact that he found 66 paper wrappers and 39 glass covers in the park, which means he already had 40 + 66 = 106 pieces of paper before he started collecting more."
"Response: 34
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 46 paper wrappers and caps for bottles in the park. He now has 21 cap covers for bottles and 52 pieces of wrapping paper. Therefore, he found 34 more cap covers than he currently has."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Danny found 65 paper objects (omev and pokrovce) in the park. He now has 31 pokrovces and 9 omev in his collection. To find out how many more omev than pokrovce he found in the park, we subtract the number of pokrovce he has from the total number of paper objects he found: 65 - 31 = 34. Therefore, Danny found 40 more omev than pokrovce in the park."
"Response: 43
Explanation: According to the passage, Danny had 58 pokrovcev and 25 ometov in the park initially. After he collected some of them, he had 11 ometov and 12 pokrovcev left in his collection. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of pokrovcev (58) and the final number of pokrovcev (12) is equal to the number of additional pokrovcev that Danny collected, which is 46 (58 - 12 = 46)."
"Response: 43
Explanation: According to the question, Danny had 67 omevs and 35 pokrove for glasses. If he found 15 covers for glasses and 18 omets in the park, then he must have started with more omevs than pokrove. Therefore, the number of omevs Danny has now is 67 - 18 = 49, which is greater than the number of pokrove he has, 35. So, Danny has 49 more omevs than pokrove."

Response: 19 (Dave has 15 applications initially and adds 71 new ones, so he now has 86 applications in total. If he selects some of them to remove, let's say 14, then he is left with 72 applications).
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 16 applications and 77 files on his phone before he deleted some of them. After deleting some of them, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. To find out how many applications he deleted, we can divide the number of applications he started with by the number he ended with: 16 / 5 = 4. Therefore, Dave deleted 4 applications from his phone."

Question:  How many baseball cards does Jeff have now?  
Based on the information provided, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 578"
"Response: 108
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 566 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 535 cards left, so Jeff must have received 31 cards (566 - 535 = 31)."
"Response: 278
Explanation: According to the information provided, Nell had 309 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 cards with ten. To find out how many baseball cards Nell has more than ten, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her original total. This gives us 278 baseball cards that Nell has more than ten."
"Response: 386

Explanation:
Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 cards of the other type (not specified). To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than before, we need to subtract the number of cards she gave to Jeff from her original total:

404 - 246 = 158

So, Nell now has 158 more baseball cards than she did originally."
Response: 48
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the information provided, Jeff received 178 baseball cards from Nell and he already had 55 cards of that set. So, the total number of baseball cards Nell has is 178 + 55 = 233. Since Nell gave some of her cards away, she now has fewer than 233 baseball cards. Therefore, Nell has at least 26 more baseball cards than 10."
"Response: 45
Explanation:  According to the information provided, Nell had 239 baseball cards and gave some away to Jeff. Now she has 376 baseball cards and 111 basketball cards.

Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children in the bus. After they got off at the stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. Therefore, 7 children got off at the stop."
"Response: 33

Explanation:
The number of children in the bus before they got off at the stop is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who got off at the stop. Therefore, we can calculate the number of children in the bus before the stop as follows:

Total number of children = 41 - 18 = 23
So, there were 23 children in the bus before it reached the stop."

"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 36 children in the bus, and then 68 children got off at the stop. This means that 46 children (36 - 68) remained in the bus. Since some of these children also boarded the bus again, we need to subtract the number of children who boarded from the total number of remaining children to find out how many children actually left the bus. In this case, the answer is 20 (46 - 26)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 22 children in the bus, and then 40 children got off at the stop. Therefore, the number of children who remained in the bus is 22 - 40 = -18. Since two children entered the bus after stopping, the final number of children in the bus is -18 + 2 = 16."

"Response: 30

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* Pečar (the baker) made 99 cakes.
* He bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 of them.

So, the number of cakes that the baker bought minus the number of cakes he sold is equal to the number of cakes he made. Therefore, we can calculate the number of cakes that the baker bought by subtracting the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he made:

99 - 89 = 10

So, the baker bought 10 cakes."

"Response: 30

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Pečar je naredil 62 + 149 = 211 torte.
Prodal jih je 144.
So, the number of tarts that the baker still has is:
211 - 144 = 67."
"Response: 35

Explanation:
The statement ""Pečar je naredil 81 torte"" means that the baker made 81 tarts. Then, it says ""Nato je naredil še 92 torte"", which means that the baker also made additional 92 tarts after making the first 81. Finally, it asks how many more tarts the baker made than those he sold. To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of tarts sold (46) from the total number of tarts made (92): 92 - 46 = 46. Therefore, the baker made 46 more tarts than he sold."

Explanation:
To calculate how much money Če Lewis will earn in total during his 73 years of harvesting, we need to multiply his daily income by the number of days he works per year and then sum up all those amounts.

So, if Če Lewis earns $1357 per week (which is equivalent to $80,564 per year), and he works for 223 days per year (which is equivalent to 5.5 months), then he will have worked for a total of:

223 days x $80,564 per year = $1,766,672 per year

Since Če Lewis will work for 73 years, he will have earned a total of:

$1,766,672 per year x 73 years = $126,333,316

Therefore, Če Lewis will have earned a total of $126,333,316 during his 73 years of harvesting."

Question:  Po počitku sta se odločila za plavanje. Če je globina vode 10 krat večja od Deanove višine in stoji na 9 stopinj koliko globlje je voda od Deanove višine?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 36 meters (118 feet)"
Response:  The depth of the water is twice Dean's height, which means it is 8 meters (2 times 4 meters).
"Response: 50 meters

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that the depth of the water is five times greater than Ron's height. Since Ron is 3 meters tall, and he is smaller than Dean, who is 6 meters tall, the depth of the water must be at least 6 x 5 = 30 meters. However, since Dean is also taller than Ron by 3 meters (Dean - Ron = 3), the actual depth of the water is 3 + 30 = 33 meters."
Response:  The depth of the water is 24 times greater than Dean's height (1.80 m). So if Dean is 1.80 m tall and he is standing at an angle of 13 degrees above the horizontal, then the depth of the water is 24 x 1.80 = 43.20 m.
Response:  The depth of the water was 24 times greater than Ron's height (13 meters). So if Ron was 9 meters tall, then the depth of the water was 24 x 9 = 216 meters.
Response: 9 x (Dean's height) = 9(15) = 135 meters deep was the water.

Explanation: If there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel and 20 people can ride at the same time, then each seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5)."
Response: 5 seats.
"Response: 80
Explanation: If each seat in the helicopter can accommodate 15 people and there are 19 seats in total, then the maximum number of passengers that can be carried by the helicopter is 19 x 15 = 285 people. Since we are asked how many people can ride 20 bicycles at once in the helicopter, we need to divide this number by 15 (the capacity of one seat) to get the final answer of 80 people."
Response: 60 people can ride on the Ferris wheel at once. Explanation: If each seat can accommodate 15 people and there are 18 seats in total, then the maximum capacity of the Ferris wheel is 18 x 15 = 270 people. However, if 10 seats are broken, then only 18 x 15 - 10 = 240 people can ride on the Ferris wheel at once.
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, each seat on the Ferris wheel can accommodate 14 people. If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, that means there are 32 empty seats (16 - 14 = 32)."
Response: 80 people can ride on the small seats of the Ferris wheel at Rajski Park. Explanation: The total number of small seats (2 x 14 = 28) is less than half of the total capacity of the Ferris wheel (23), so we can safely assume that all 28 small seats are occupied. Therefore, the remaining 76 seats (23 - 28 = 76) are large seats, and each of them can accommodate 54 people, resulting in a total capacity of 76 x 54 = 4080 people.
Response: 48 people can ride on the large seats of the helicopter.

Matthew gave each of his 11 friends 2 creamers, so he had given out a total of 22 creamers (2 x 11 = 22)."
Response: 4
Response:  Each of Matthew's five friends received 2 Krekers (since there were initially 15 Krekers and now there are only 10 left, each friend received half).
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 24 knives and gave some of them to his three friends. Let's assume that he gave an equal number of knives (24/3 = 8) to each friend. So, after giving knives away, Matthew had 24 - 8 = 16 knives left. Now, the question asks how many knives Matthew gave to his other two friends. Since he gave 8 knives to each of his first three friends, he must have given 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 knives to the remaining two friends. Therefore, the final number of knives Matthew has is 16 - 24 = -8 knives."
Response:  Each of Matthews' 11 friends received an equal number of creamers and tarts as Matthew had himself (i.e., 22 creamers and 34 tarts). Therefore, each friend received 22/11 = 2 creamers and 34/11 = 3 tarts.

"Response: 5760
Explanation:
Faye has 28 swan neck reflectors and each of them contains 24 reflectors, so she has a total of 28 x 24 = 676 reflectors. Since she wants to place them in rows, we need to divide this number by the number of rows she can make with one row having 16 reflectors per row. Therefore, the number of rows she can make is 676 / 16 = 43. So, Faye can make 43 rows of reflectors."
"Response: 360

Response: 360 seats. Explanation: If there are 7 school buses and each bus can seat 50 students (since all buses are full), then the total number of seats in all buses is 7 x 50 = 350 seats. Since there are also 98 students in the school, we need to add an additional 350 + 98 = 448 seats for all the students. Therefore, there are 448 seats in total.
"Response: 6720
Explanation:
The number of students in the school can be calculated as follows:
Number of school buses = 95
Capacity of each bus = 118 seats
Total capacity of all buses = Number of buses x Capacity of each bus
= 95 x 118
= 10,930 seats
Now, we know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an average of 30 students (as mentioned in the passage). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is equal to the number of classrooms x Average number of students per classroom
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
However, since some of the buses may not be fully occupied, let's assume that only 90% of the seats are used (i.e., 90% of 10,930 seats = 9,923 seats). So, the actual number of students in the school would be:
Actual number of students = Total capacity of buses x Percentage of seats used
= 9,923
Therefore, the correct answer is 6720 students."
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 67 students in total and each class has 66 students, then there will be 1 student who does not have a seat on the school bus. Therefore, we need 3 school buses to accommodate all of the students for the field trip."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 87 students and 58 classes, so each class has an equal number of students (87 / 58 = 1.5). Since each student needs two seats on the bus, we need 34 buses (2 x 1.5 = 3). Therefore, we need four buses for the entire group (4 x 34 = 136)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 120 students in total and each class has an equal number of students. Therefore, there are 120 / 5 = 24 classes. Since each school bus can seat 84 people, we know that the number of students in each class is equal to the number of seats available on each bus divided by the number of buses. So, the number of students in each class is 84 / 5 = 16. This means that there are 16 students in each class."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 102 students and 8 seats per bus, then we need 4 buses to transport all of them on an outing if 22 students do not go."
"Response: 87
Explanation: If 8 students do not go on the field trip, there will be 102 - 8 = 94 students left at school. Since each bus can seat 99 people, there will be 94 / 99 = 87 students per bus."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 72 classrooms in the school and each classroom has three seats per bus, then we need 72 x 3 = 216 seats for all the classes to go on an outing. Since there are 111 students in total, we need 4 buses to accommodate them all (216 / 55 = 4)."
Response: 46 / 92 = 0.5 seats per bus.

Answer: 139 days"
"Response: 35
Explanation:
The problem states that Frank read his favorite book and that the book had 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. It also says that it took him six days to finish reading the book. Therefore, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows:
Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish reading the book
= 612 pages / 6 days
= 102 pages per day
So, Frank read 102 pages per day."
"Response: 17
Explanation: According to the passage, it took Frank 220 days to finish his favorite book, which had 555 pages. Since each chapter has an equal number of pages (as stated in the problem), we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:

Number of chapters = Number of pages / Number of pages per chapter
= 555 / 9
= 61 pages per chapter

Therefore, each chapter has 61 pages."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:
• The book had 193 pages.
• The book was equally divided into 15 chapters.
• It took Frank 660 days to complete the book.
To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we can divide the number of days it took him to finish the book by the number of chapters:
660 days / 15 chapters = 44 days
So, Frank read one chapter every 44 days."
"Response: 80
Explanation: If Frank took 3 days to read each book and each book had 249 pages, then he would have read a total of 697 pages (249 x 3) over those three days. Therefore, he read 80 pages per day (697 / 3)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 30 books. Since each book had 66 pages and it took him 12 days to read each book, he spent 784 days (12 x 66) reading all 30 books. Therefore, the total number of days Frank spent reading all the books is 492 - 784 = -392 days."
Response: 4 pages per day = 50 pages in 16 days = 3.33 pages per day 
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: If Frank read 8 pages of his favorite book per day and the book had 576 pages, it will take him 3 days to finish reading the entire book (576 / 8 = 72)."

Response:  V Philipovi zbirki banan je 9 groupes of bananas (bananes sont divisées en groupes de taille 2).
"Response: 3569

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
V Philipovi zbirki banan je nekaj banan (let's call it x).
Since there are 140 groups of size 187, we have:
x / 140 = 187
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 187 × 140 = 3569
Therefore, there are 3569 bananas in Philip's collection."
"Response: 14
Explanation: If there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges, and they are divided into groups of 7 bananas and 95 groups of oranges, then each group of bananas contains 14 bananas (203 / 7 = 28)."
"Response:  R 142/47 = 3
Therefore, each group of bananas has 47 bananas and each group of oranges has 178 oranges."
Response:  There are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. If there are 392 bananas in Philip's collection, then each group contains an average of 1.75 bananas (392 / 196 = 1.75).
Response:  There are 9 groups of size 18 in Philip's collection, and each group contains 18 bananas. Therefore, there are 9 x 18 = 162 bananas in Philip's collection.
"Response: 14
Explanation: If there are 290 bananas and they are divided into two groups of equal size, then each group must contain at least 290/2 = 145 bananas. Since there are 87 oranges and they are divided into 93 groups, each group must contain at most 87/93 = 9 bananas. Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is 145 - 9 = 14."

Response: 38 / 19 = 2 gostih (guests)
Response: 42 (Brenda has prepared 42 pişkotes for 14 people).
"Response: 40

Explanation:
If Brenda's mother made 22 piškotkov and had to reject 17 of them, that means she has 5 piškotkov left. If each person is supposed to have an equal number of piškotkov, then there are 5 people in total. Therefore, each person would have 40 piškotkov (5 x 8 = 40)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If Brenda made 18 piškotkov and each guest had an equal number of piškotkov as the number of guests, then each guest would have received 18/10 = 1.8 piškotkov. Since 9 guests did not come, they did not receive any piškotkov. Therefore, the total number of piškotkov that were given out is 1.8 x 9 = 16.2 piškotkov."
"Response: 7

Explanation: If each guest has an equal number of pips as requested by Mama, then there would be twice as many pips for two guests in total, which is 14 x 2 = 28 pips. Therefore, each guest would have 28 / 2 = 14 pips."
Response: 5 guests

"Response: 4
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, if Frank gave 11 pieces of candy to each box, and he has 22 bonbons in total, then he must have 22 / 11 = 2 boxes of candy. Therefore, he has 4 boxes of candy."

"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 317 visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day after 295 visitors the previous day. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on those two days is 40 (317 - 295 = 40)."
"Response: 25 x 10 = 250

Explanation:
The passage states that there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the previous day and that Rachel found out that there were 246 visitors on that day. To find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace in 25 days, we need to multiply the number of visitors per day by 25. Therefore, the answer is 250 visitors per day."
"Response: 244

Explanation:
According to the passage, there were 100 visitors at Buckingham Palace on the previous day and 666 visitors on the current day. To find out how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the current day than on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day:

666 - 100 = 566

So, there were 566 more visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on the current day than on the previous day."
"Response: 589

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* There were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after the long weekend (Day 328).
* In the last 327 days before Day 328, there were 406 visitors to Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace on the previous day (Day 327), we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors on Day 327 = Number of visitors in last 327 days x (327 / 328)
= 406 x (1 / 328)
= 589

Therefore, the answer to the question is 589."
"Response: 737

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* Previous day, there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* In the last 85 days, 829 people have visited Buckingham Palace.

To find out how many people visited the palace on the day of the observation, we can use the following calculation:

Number of visitors = Total number of visitors / Number of days since previous observation
= 829 / 85
= 737

Therefore, the answer to the question is 737."
Response: 557 + 188 = 745
"Response: 41
Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:
* On the day after the rain, they went to see Buckingham Palace.
* In Buckingham Palace, there were 39 paintings.
* Rachel found out that there were 661 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day.
* The previous day, there were 600 visitors.

To find out how many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day, we can subtract the number of visitors on the first day from the number of visitors on the second day:

661 - 600 = 61

Therefore, 61 more people visited Buckingham Palace on the second day than on the first day."
"Response: 586

Explanation:
We know that there were 419 visitors yesterday and 103 visitors two days ago. Therefore, the total number of visitors before today is:
419 + 103 = 522
Since there were 92 visitors today, the total number of visitors before today plus today's visitors is:
522 + 92 = 614
So, the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before today was 614."
"Response: 635

Explanation:
The information provided in the question is as follows:

* There were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after the long weekend (Tuesday).
* There were 471 visitors the day before (Monday).
* There were 808 visitors the day before that (Sunday).

To find out how many visitors have visited Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days, we need to use the following formula:

Number of visitors = Day 1 + Day 2 +... + Day 89

In this case, the number of visitors in the last 89 days would be:

Number of visitors = 512 + 471 +... + 808 = 635

Therefore, the answer to the question is 635."
"Response: 368

Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:

* On the day after the long weekend (day 2), there were 191 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* On the day before the long weekend (day -1), there were 457 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* The total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the previous 245 days was 705.

To find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that particular day than in the previous 245 days, we need to subtract the number of visitors on day -1 from the total number of visitors over the previous 245 days:

705 - 457 = 248

So, on that particular day, there were 248 more visitors at Buckingham Palace than in the previous 245 days."
"Response: 307 grams
Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Naslednji na seznamu je vosek za lepljenje perja skupaj = 159 g
Perje zahteva 628 g voska
To find out how much vosk is already used for feathering, we need to subtract the amount of vosk required for feathering from the total amount of vosk available:
159 g (already used) + 628 g (required) = 787 g
Since the question asks for the number of grams of vosk already used, we divide the total amount by 100:
787 g / 100 = 7.87 grams
So, there are 7.87 grams of wax already used for feathering."
"Response: 38 grams
Explanation: According to the question, the amount of wax needed for feathering is 260 grams less than the amount of wax already available (49 grams). Therefore, the remaining amount of wax needed is 260 - 49 = 38 grams."

"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 90 sodova grozdja that need to be filled within six days after the speaker's death. If each day has 24 hours (as it is assumed), then the number of hours available for filling the sods is 6 x 24 = 144 hours. Dividing this number by 90 (the number of sods to be filled) gives us an estimate of approximately 1.6 hours per sod. Therefore, the answer is 12, as there are 12 hours in a standard working day."
"Response: 18
Explanation: According to the passage, it took 5 days for the grape harvesters to fill 90 barrels of wine. If they worked every day during those 5 days, then they would have filled 90/5 = 18 barrels per day."
Response: 3058 sodov grozdja.
Response: 4698 sodov grozdja (or 4698 x 221 = 101762 sodova)
"Response: 34.67
Explanation:
To find out how many sods of grapes would be filled in 58 days, we need to use the information provided in the question. The number of bottles (sod) that can be filled with grapes per day is given by the formula: Number of bottles = Total amount of grapes / Amount of grapes per bottle.
In this case, the total amount of grapes is 108 kg and the amount of grapes per bottle is 0.252 kg/bottle. Therefore, the number of bottles that can be filled with grapes per day is:
Number of bottles = 108 kg / 0.252 kg/bottle = 430.41 bottles/day
Since there are 58 days in the period, the total number of bottles that can be filled with grapes is:
Total number of bottles = 430.41 bottles/day x 58 days = 24,923.83 bottles
Therefore, the answer to the question is 24,923.83 bottles."
"Response: 5 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it takes 8 fillings of 8 jugs (or 1 day per filling) to complete 36 jugs.

Response: 40 boards
"Response: 250

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Let 'n' be the number of small boards (less than 1 meter long).
Then, for each board, we need 17 nails to fix it. So, the total number of nails required is 17n.
Also, there are 13 large boards that require 8 nails each, so the total number of nails required for the large boards is 13 x 8 = 104.
Therefore, the total number of nails required is 17n + 104.
Given that the total number of nails required is 250, we have:
17n + 104 = 250
Solving for n, we get:
n = 15.
So, John needs 15 nails to fix the fence."

Question:  V avtobusu je bilo 12 ljudi. Na naslednji postaji so v avtobus vstopili še štirje ljudje. Vaki avtobus ne smeta imeti več kot 36 ljudi. Koliko ljudi je zdaj v avtobusu?  
Instructions: Use the information provided in the question to formulate an algebraic expression or equation that represents the number of people in the bus at the current stop.  Solution: Let x be the number of people who got off the bus at the previous stop. Then, the total number of people in the bus now is 12 + 4 = 16 + x. Since each bus can carry up to 36 people, we have 16 + x ≤ 36. Simplifying this inequality, we get 10x ≤ 192. Solving for x, we find that there are currently 18 people in the bus. Therefore, the answer is 18."

Explanation:
Adam has 4 polic and each policy can hold 11 action figures. Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam can place on his policies is 4 x 11 = 44. Since there are 40 omelets, we cannot use all of them to store action figures, so the maximum number of action figures that Adam can have is 44 + 40 = 84."
"Response: 4

Explanation: According to the question, Adam had 10 action figures that he could place on each policy in his room. However, since there were only 8 action figures available in the room, Adam must have placed 2 action figures somewhere else outside of the room. Therefore, the number of policies with action figures inside is 4."
