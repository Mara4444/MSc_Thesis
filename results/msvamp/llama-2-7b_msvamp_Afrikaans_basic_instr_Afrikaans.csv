Explanation:
Tiffany had 8 bags of chips on Monday and found 7 more bags the next day. Therefore, she had a total of 8 + 7 = 15 bags of chips on Monday."
"Response: 15

Explanation:
Tiffany had 7 bags of chips on Monday and found an additional 12 bags the next day. To find out how many more bags she found than what she had on Monday, we need to subtract the number of bags she already had (7) from the total number of bags she found the next day (12):

Number of more bags = Total number of bags found - Number of bags already had = 12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, Tiffany found 5 more bags of chips than what she had on Monday."

Explanation:
The first chapter has 91 pages, the second chapter has 23 pages, and the third chapter has 25 pages. To find out how many pages the first chapter has more than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter.

So, the difference between the number of pages in the first chapter and the number of pages in the second chapter is:
91 - 23 = 68

Therefore, the first chapter has 68 more pages than the second chapter."

"Response: 35,67 square feet (Voet 1)

Hulp:  To determine the area of the floor, we need to multiply the length and width of the room. The length of the room is 4 feet, and the width is 20 feet, so the area of the room is:

Area = Length x Width = 4 x 20 = 80 square feet

Since Jessie has 18 four-foot squares of carpet, she needs enough carpet to cover the entire floor, which means she needs:

Carpet needed = Total Area - Area already covered by Jessie's squares = 80 - 18 = 62 square feet

Therefore, Jessie needs 62 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor."

Explanation:
The cost price of each T-shirt is $23, and they sold 156 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. Therefore, the total revenue generated from selling T-shirts was $230 (156 x $23)."
Response:  To determine the cost of each T-shirt, we need to divide the total revenue by the number of T-shirts sold. In this case, the total revenue was $51 and there were 3 T-shirts sold. Therefore, the cost of each T-shirt can be calculated as follows: Cost = Total Revenue / Number of T-shirts Sold = $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt

Response:  To determine the number of T-shirts sold by Razorback, we need to subtract the number of shirts sold from the total number of items sold. According to the problem, Razorback sold 157 T-shirts and 19 trousers, so the total number of items sold is: 157 + 19 = 176. Therefore, the number of T-shirts sold by Razorback is: 157 - 19 = 138.
Response:  To determine the number of shirts sold more than hats, we need to subtract the total revenue from hats ($232) from the total revenue ($86 + $232 = $318). Then, divide this difference by the price of a hat ($232 / $86 = 0.27 or 27%). So, for every hat sold, Arkansas and Texas Tech made $27 in profit.
"Response: 467 dollar.

Begripe: De Arkansas en Texas Tech universiteites het $ 467 dollar gemaak deur die T-hemde te verkoop. Dit is berekend aan die $ 51 dollar prijs van elke T-hemp, minus die $ 8 dollar afslag en plus die 130 T-hemde wat verkoop was."
Response: 3580 dollar.
Response:  To determine how many T-shirts the Razorback T-shop sold during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we need to use the information provided in the problem. According to the problem, the Razorback T-shop made $60 from selling T-shirts during the game. If they earned $10 for each T-shirt they sold, then the number of T-shirts they sold can be found by dividing the amount of money they earned by the price of each T-shirt: Number of T-shirts = $60 / $10 = 60 T-shirts Therefore, the Razorback T-shop sold 60 T-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

Response: 3960 dollar.
Response:  To determine the number of T-shirts sold more than trousers, we need to subtract the total revenue from trousers from the total revenue. The total revenue from trousers is $ 240 x 177 = $ 43,860. Subtracting this amount from the total revenue gives us the excess revenue from T-shirts: $ 210 x 23 = $ 4,930. Therefore, T-shirts were sold more than trousers by $ 4,930.
Response:  To determine the number of shirts sold more than t-shirts, we need to subtract the total revenue from t-shirts from the total revenue from both shirts and hats. Let's do that: Total revenue from shirts = 113 x $ 25 = $ 2 725 Total revenue from hats = $ 115 x 78 = $ 9030 Total revenue from both = $ 2 725 + $ 9030 = $ 11 755 Now, let's find out how many shirts were sold more than t-shirts: Number of shirts sold more than t-shirts = Total revenue from shirts - Total revenue from t-shirts = $ 2 725 - $ 903 = $ 1 823 Therefore, there were 1823 shirts sold more than t-shirts.

Explanation:

To find out how many days the 88 water bottles will last, we need to divide the number of water bottles by the number of water bottles consumed per day. In this case, Debbie consumed 4 water bottles per day, so we can calculate the number of days the remaining water bottles will last as follows:

Number of days = Number of water bottles / Number of water bottles consumed per day
= 88 water bottles / 4 water bottles per day
= 205 days

Therefore, the water bottles will last for approximately 205 days."

Response:  To determine the number of seat places available on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students (98) by the number of buses (7). This gives us an average of 14 seats per bus. Since there are 21 classrooms at the school, we can assume that each classroom has approximately 14 students. Therefore, the total number of seat places available on all seven buses is:  Number of seat places = Total number of students / Number of buses x Average number of students per bus = 98 / 7 x 14 = 636 seat places
Response: 2670 (84 x 95 = 8020 en 8020 / 118 = 2670).
Response: 23 busse sal nodig wees vir die reis van die skool. Om dit te bereken, gebruik jy die volgende formules: Number of schoolbuses = Total number of learners / Number of seats per schoolbus = 66 x 65 = 4080 / 6 = 23 busse
"Response:  To determine the number of school buses needed for a field trip, we need to calculate the total number of students and divide it by the capacity of each bus. Based on the information provided, there are 87 classrooms with 58 learners in each classroom, making a total of 4960 learners. Since each bus can seat 20 learners, we need:

Number of buses = Total number of learners / Capacity of each bus
= 4960 / 20
= 248 buses
Therefore, 248 school buses would be needed to transport all the learners on the field trip."
Response: 120 / 12 = 10 leerlinge per klas.
Response:  To determine the number of buses needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available on each bus. In this case, there are 102 students and 8 seats per bus, so we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus = 102 students / 8 seats per bus = 13 buses Therefore, 13 buses would be needed to transport all the students on the field trip.
"Response: 11 + (9 x 8) = 73

Het jy dit? Great! Now let's move on to the next question.

Question 2: The school plans a field trip. The school has 102 classrooms. There are 11 students in the school and 99 seatbelts in each school bus. How many students will go on the trip if 8 students do not want to go?

Based on the information provided, can you formulate a numerical answer? Answer: 11 + (9 x 8) = 73"
Response:  To determine the number of school buses needed for a field trip, we need to use the information provided in the question. We know that there are 72 classrooms at the school and 3 seats per bus. Since there are 111 students in the school, we can calculate the number of buses needed as follows: Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of students per bus = 111 students / 3 seats per bus = 37 buses Therefore, 37 school buses would be needed for the field trip.
Response:  To determine the number of seat places available on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students (92) by the number of buses (46). This gives us an average of 2 seats per bus. Since there are 17 classes, and each class has 46 students, we can calculate the number of seat places available for each class as follows: Number of seat places per class = Total number of students / Number of buses x Average number of seats per bus Class 1: 92 students / 46 buses x 2 seats/bus = 8 seat places Class 2: 92 students / 46 buses x 2 seats/bus = 8 seat places... Class 17: 92 students / 46 buses x 2 seats/bus = 8 seat places Therefore, there are 8 seat places available on each of the 17 school buses.

Response:  To determine the size of each group of penguins and lemons, we need to divide the total number of penguins and lemons by the number of groups. Let's use the following formula: Group Size = Total Number of Items / Number of Groups. In this case, the total number of items is 203 penguins + 63 lemons = 266. If there are 7 groups of penguins and 95 groups of lemons, then the size of each group is: Group Size = 266 / 7 = 38 penguins per group Group Size = 63 / 95 = 0.66 lemons per group Therefore, there are 38 penguins in each group and approximately 0.66 lemons in each group.
Response:  To determine the size of each group of lemons, we need to divide the total number of lemons (178) by the number of groups (47). This gives us an average of 3.79 lemons per group.
Response:  Elke groep van piesangs in Philippus' samling is ongeveer 5,4 personen groot (392 / 196).
Response: 18 / 180 = 10 groepe
"Response:  To determine the size of each group of penguins and lemons, we need to divide the total number of penguins and lemons among the groups. Let's assume that there are x groups of penguins and y groups of lemons. We know that the total number of penguins is 87 and the total number of lemons is 290. Therefore, we can write the following equations:

Number of penguins in each group = Total number of penguins / Number of groups of penguins
= 87 / x

Similarly, we can write an equation for the number of lemons in each group:

Number of lemons in each group = Total number of lemons / Number of groups of lemons
= 290 / y

Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. We can do this by substituting one equation into the other and solving for x and y. For example, if we substitute the expression for the number of penguins in each group into the equation for the number of lemons in each group, we get:

Number of lemons in each group = (Total number of lemons / Number of groups of lemons) × (Number of penguins in each group)
= (290 / y) × x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 290y

So, the value of x is equal to 290 times the value of y. Similarly, we can find the value of y by substituting the expression for the number of penguins in each group into the equation for the number of lemons in each group:

Number of lemons in each group = (Total number of lemons / Number of groups of lemons) × (Number of penguins in each group)
= (290 / y) × x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y = 290x

Therefore, the value of y is equal to 290 times the value of x. So, there are 87 groups of penguins and 290 groups of lemons."
"Response:  To determine the size of each group of lemons and pineapples, we need to divide the total number of lemons and pineapples by the number of groups. Let's do this:

Total number of lemons = 384
Total number of pineapples = 192
Number of groups of lemons = Total number of lemons / Number of groups = 384 / x (where x is the number of groups)
Number of groups of pineapples = Total number of pineapples / Number of groups = 192 / y (where y is the number of groups)

Now, let's find out how many groups there are for both lemons and pineapples:

Number of groups of lemons = 384 / x = 384 / 345 = 10.75 (round up to 11 groups)
Number of groups of pineapples = 192 / y = 192 / 345 = 5.5 (round down to 5 groups)

So, there are 11 groups of lemons and 5 groups of pineapples in Philip's collection."

In this problem, we are given two quantities of soda sold by a convenience store: 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. We want to find out how many more bottles of diet soda the store sold compared to regular soda.

To do this, we can use simple arithmetic. Since we know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is 83 (22 + 61), we can divide the number of diet soda bottles by the number of regular soda bottles to get the ratio of diet soda to regular soda:

61 / 22 = 2.73

In this case, there were 71 paintings at Buckingham Palace and Rachel found that 557 people visited that day. Since there were 188 visitors the previous day, we can calculate the number of visitors per day as follows:

Explanation:

The problem states that a Postman must deliver 9 packages to each house in every block. There are 20 houses in each block. To find out how many packages the postman needs to deliver in total, we can use the following calculation:

Number of blocks = Number of houses per block x Total number of houses
= 20 x 200
= 4000 houses

Since there are 9 packages per house, the total number of packages the postman needs to deliver is:

Total number of packages = Number of houses x Number of packages per house
= 4000 x 9
= 36,000 packages

Therefore, the answer is 36,000 packages."
Response:  To determine the number of pieces of rubbish that the postman must deliver to each house on a block with 6 houses, we can use the following formula: Number of pieces of rubbish per house = Total number of pieces of rubbish / Number of houses on the block. In this case, the total number of pieces of rubbish is 24, and there are 6 houses on the block, so the number of pieces of rubbish per house is 24/6 = 4. Therefore, the postman must deliver 4 pieces of rubbish to each house on the block.
Response: 36 huize (2 x 17 = 34 + 2).
Response:  To determine the number of pieces of rubble that a postman must deliver to each house in a block of 20 houses, we need to use the formula: Number of pieces of rubble per house = Total number of pieces of rubble / Number of houses in the block. In this case, the total number of pieces of rubble is 32 and there are 20 houses in the block, so the number of pieces of rubble per house is: 32 / 20 = 1.6. Therefore, the postman must deliver 1.6 pieces of rubble to each house in the block.
