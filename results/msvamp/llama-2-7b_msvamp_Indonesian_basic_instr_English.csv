Explanation:
If there are 19 families of birds living near the mountain and 60 more families fly away for winter, then the total number of bird families is 19 + 60 = 79. Since there are only 4 options given in the question, we can conclude that the correct answer is 38."

Response:  There are 19 keluarga burung left near the mountain after 23 families flew to Africa and 37 families flew to Asia.
"Response: 59
Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of bird families is x. Since 42 bird families flew to Africa and 31 bird families flew to Asia, we can write:
x - 42 = 31
Now, we know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain. So, the number of bird families living near the mountain is equal to x / 8. Therefore, we can write:
x / 8 = 59
So, the answer is 59."
Response: 56 (94 - 47)
Response: 256 (38 + 80)
Response: 95
"Response: 106

Explanation:

Response:  There are 19 keluarga burung left near the mountain after 27 families of birds migrate for winter.
"Response: 139
Explanation:
The passage states that ""86 keluarga burung terbang untuk musim dingin dari dekat gunung."" This means that 86 families of birds flew away for winter from near the mountain. Then, it is mentioned that ""45 keluarga burung yang tinggal di dekat gunung pada awalnya."" This means that initially, there were 45 families of birds living near the mountain. Therefore, the difference between the number of families that fled for winter and the initial number of families living near the mountain is 86 - 45 = 139."
Response: 62/41 = 1.51 (approximately)

"Response: 274

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Paul initially received x pensils for his birthday. After using some of them and losing or giving away others, he was left with 177 pensils. To find out how many pensils Paul originally received, we can set up the equation:

x - 551 = 177

Solving for x, we get:

x = 274

Therefore, Paul originally received 274 pensils for his birthday."
"Response: 300
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 440 pensils for his birthday and gave away 111 pensils to his friends during the school year while he lost 106 pensils. Therefore, the number of pensils that Paul has left is 440 - 111 + 106 = 300."
Response: 407 pensils (213 + 16)
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 571 pensils and lost 161 pensils, so he has 571 - 161 = 410 pensils left. Therefore, he gave away more pensils than he lost, which is 410 - 161 = 250 pensils."
"Response: 368
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 90 pensils and lost 412 pensils. So, the total number of pensils he had at the end was 90 - 412 = -322 pensils. Therefore, the answer is 368 (the negative value of -322)."
"Response: 410
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Paul received x pensils for his birthday. (Since he gave away 563 pensils and lost 558 pensils, the total number of pensils he received is equal to the number he had left minus the number he gave away.)
* He gave away 563 pensils to his friends.
* He lost 558 pensils.
* The remaining pensils he has are 332.

Now, let's solve for x:
x = 332 - 563 + 558
= 410

Therefore, Paul received 410 pensils for his birthday."
"Response: 535 - 492 = 43

Explanation:
The number of pensils that Paul has left is 492. He gave away 52 pensils to his friends, so he lost 535 - 52 = 43 pensils."
"Response: 307
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 521 pensils and used 66 of them. This means that he had 521 - 66 = 455 pensils left at the end of the year. Since he did not lose any pensils, the number of pensils he has now is 455."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 531 pensils and 38 erasers at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he only had 391 pensils left while not losing any erasers. Therefore, there are 40 more pensils in his possession now than at the beginning of the year."
"Response: 270
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 601 pensils at the beginning of his birthday celebration and used 406 for various activities throughout the day. This means that he has 295 pensils left (601 - 406 = 295). However, since he did not lose any pensils, the number of pensils he has left is equal to the initial amount minus the number used, which is 270 (295 - 406 = -270). Therefore, there are 270 pensils remaining from the original 601."
Response: 291
"Response: 54
Explanation: According to the question, Paul gave away 308 pensils and lost 231 pensils, so he has 77 pensils left (308 - 231 = 77). Therefore, he gave away 54 more pensils than he had at the beginning of the year (77 - 231 = -154)."
"Response: 198
Explanation: According to the question, Paul had 457 erasable blocks and 320 pens at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he only had 523 remaining while not losing any erasable blocks. Therefore, there are 198 more pens than erasable blocks that Paul has."

Response: 4
"Response: 3
Explanation:

"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Paul initially had 2 books and later bought 150 new ones. This means that he now has 180 books (2 + 150). Since he sold some of his old books at a garage sale, he must have sold at least 58 books (the number he currently has minus the number he originally had). Therefore, the answer is 30."
"Response: 39
Explanation:
Paul initially had 21 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 42 new books, which means he now has 73 books (21 + 42). Since he sold 15 books, he has 58 books left with him (73 - 15 = 58)."
"Response: 48
Explanation: According to the question, Paul sold 71 books and then bought 38 new ones. This means he has 33 (71 - 38) books left after selling some of his original collection. Therefore, he bought 48 books more than he originally had (33 + 48 = 81)."
Response: 32
Response: 70
"Response: 59
Explanation:
Let's assume that Paul had x number of books initially. Since he sold some books at his garage sale and was left with 27 books, we can write an equation:
x - 27 = 136 (books available after selling)
Now, we need to find out how many books Paul had initially. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 27:
x / 27 = 136 / 27
x = 59
Therefore, Paul had 59 books initially."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica removed 33 marigolds from the vase and cut some new ones from the flower garden to put into the vase. Now there are 17 marigolds in the vase. To find out how many more marigolds she cut from those she originally bought, we can subtract the number of marigolds in the vase (17) from the total number of marigolds she removed (33), which gives us 16. Therefore, Jessica cut 16 more marigolds from those she originally bought."
"Response: 76
Explanation:
Jessica took 34 marigolds from the garden and cut some new ones to put in the vase. Now there are 15 marigolds left in the vase. To find out how many more marigolds she cut from the garden, we need to subtract the number of marigolds she took (34) from the total number of marigolds she had before cutting any (76). Therefore, the answer is 76 - 34 = 42."
Response: 31
"Response: 7
Explanation:
Jessica cut some more flowers from her flower garden that had a total of 12 flowers. Now there are 21 flowers in the vase. Therefore, there were 7 flowers left in the garden."
Response:  Jessica cut 13 mawar and 62 orchids from her flower garden. Now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase. How many roses did she cut?
Response: 7
Response:  There are more than twice as many roses as orchids in the vase now. So, if there were initially 5 roses and 3 orchids, then after Jessica cut some of them from her garden, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. Therefore, there are 6 times as many roses as orchids in the vase now.
Response:  There are more than twice as many anggreck as there are mawar in the vase now. So, the number of anggreck is 20/5 = 4.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Jessica cut some flowers from the flower garden and put them in her vase initially containing 3 flowers. Now there are 19 flowers in the vase. Therefore, if there were 3 flowers in the initial vase, then Jessica must have cut 16 flowers (19 - 3 = 16)."
Response: 5 mawar
Response: 4
Response:  There are more than twice as many mawar as anggrek in the vase now. Therefore, there are 43 (22 + 21) mawar and 22 anggrek in the vase now.
Response:  There are more than 3 times as many anthuriums as there are orchids in the vase now. So, if there were originally 6 orchids and 9 anthuriums, then there must be at least 18 anthuriums and 6 orchids in the vase now (since Jessica cut some of them). Therefore, the ratio of anthuriums to orchids is at least 3:2.
Response: 20% of Robin's original hair length was cut off. So, if Robin's original hair length was 17 inches, then 20% of that is 3.4 inches (17 x 0.2 = 3.4). Therefore, after cutting 3.4 inches of his hair, Robin now has 13 inches of hair left.
Response: 5 inches
Response:  The length of Rambut Robin's hair is currently 13 inches (12 + 1).
Response: 20 inches
Response:  The length of Robin's hair decreased by 13 inches, so now it is 14 - 13 = 1 inch long.
Response:  The length of Rambut Robin's hair before cutting was 14 inches and after cutting it was reduced to 8 inches. So, the current length of her hair is 6 inches (14 - 8 = 6).

"Response: 317
Explanation:
Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card packs. She gave some of her baseball cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards left.

* Dia menjual beberapa dari mereka. (This means that he sold some of them.)

Now, let's find out how many kue were left after selling some:

Total number of kue = 54
Number of kue sold =? (We are not given this information directly)

Since we know that the total number of kue was 54 and the number of kue sold is unknown, we can assume that the number of kue sold is a portion of the total number of kue. Let's say the number of kue sold is x. Then, the number of kue left after selling x kue would be:

Total number of kue - Number of kue sold = 54 - x

So, the number of kue left after selling x kue is equal to:

x + 13 (since there were originally 13 kue left)

Now, we are asked how many kue were sold by the baker. We know that the number of kue sold is less than or equal to the total number of kue, so we can write:

x <= 54

Solving for x, we get:

x = 72

Therefore, the baker sold 72 kue."
"Response: 380

Explanation:
Let's assume that Baker made x kue. If he sold all of them, then the number of kue left with him is equal to the total number of kue he made minus the number he sold. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x - 145 = 72

Solving for x, we get:

x = 380

Therefore, Baker made 380 kue."
Response: 9 kue (155 - 140 = 9)
Response:  There are still 46 kue left in the baker's inventory (121 - 105 = 46).
Response: 76
"Response: 52

Explanation:
The total number of kue sold by the baker is given as 170. The baker sold 78 kue and bought 31 new ones, so the difference between the number of kue sold and bought is:

170 - 78 = 92

Therefore, the baker sold 52 kue more than he bought."

"Response: 20
Explanation:
Penjual roti membuat 157 kue dan 169 kue. If he sold 158 kue and 147 kue, then he sold more than 157 kue. Therefore, the difference between the number of kue sold by Penjual roti and Baker is 20 (158 - 147)."
"Response: 70
Explanation:
Tukang Roti made 54 kue and 143 kue, for a total of 197 kue. If he sold 68 kue and 92 kue, then he has 197 - 68 = 129 kue left. Since Baker sold 68 kue, Tukang Roti has more than him by 129 - 68 = 61 kue."

Response: 378 kue.
Response:  More than 100 kue. Explanation: According to the question, Tukang Roti made 52 kue and sold 102 kue, which means he sold more than half of the kue he made. Additionally, he made 84 kue but only sold 94 kue, which means he still has some kue left over. Therefore, the answer is that Tukang Roti has more than 100 kue left after selling all the kue he made.

"Response: 307

Explanation:
If Toko Kaos Razorback sold 242 kaos during both games and made $106 per kaos, then they made a total of $24,920 from both games ($106 x 242). If they sold 115 kaos during the Arkansas game, then they made $12,380 from that game alone ($106 x 115). Therefore, they made $307 more from the Texas Tech game than they did from the Arkansas game."
Response:  The amount of money earned by selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is $852 (98 x 163).
Response:  The amount of money earned by selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is $ 78 x 172 = $ 13,040.
Response:  The Razorbacks made $10,547 from selling t-shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  The Razorbacks can earn $165 from each jersey sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, so they can earn a total of $165 x 156 = $25,940 from selling jerseys alone.
Response:  The price of each Kaos is $ 192 and the price of each Jersey is $ 34. Therefore, if they sold 157 Kaos and 19 Jerseys during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, the total revenue from Kaos sales would be: $ 157 x $ 192 = $ 28,604. Similarly, the total revenue from Jersey sales would be: $ 19 x $ 34 = $ 656. So, the price of each Kaos is more expensive than each Jersey by: $ 28,604 - $ 656 = $ 27,948.

"Response: 36
Explanation:
If each seat of the Ferris wheel can accommodate 9 people and there are 18 people who want to ride it at the same time, then we need to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats are available on the Ferris wheel. Therefore, there are 2 seats per person (18 / 9 = 2). Since each seat can accommodate 9 people, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 2 x 9 = 18."
Response: 450 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time. Explanation: Each Ferris wheel has 19 seats that can accommodate 15 people each, so the total number of people who can ride on one Ferris wheel is 19 x 15 = 285 people. Since there are 20 Ferris wheels in total, the maximum number of people who can ride on them simultaneously is 285 x 20 = 5700 people.

Response: 460 seats. Explanation: If there are 7 buses and each bus has 53 seats (since there are 98 students and 7 buses), then the total number of seats available for transporting students is 7 x 53 = 361 seats. Since not all students will be able to fit on each bus, some additional seats may be left unoccupied. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that more than half of the available seats would remain empty, so we can estimate that approximately 460 seats will be used during the field trip.
Response: 206 (84 classrooms x 95 buses = 7830 students)
Response: 10 buses. Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed to transport all 66 students from each class of 67 classes, we can use the following calculation: Number of buses = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus. In this case, the total number of students is 66 x 67 = 4226, and the capacity of each bus is 66 students / 6 seats = 10 buses. Therefore, 10 buses are needed to transport all the students for their field trip.
"Response: 16
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per bus. Since there are 87 ruang kelas and 58 siswa per class, the total number of students is 87 x 58 = 4904. If each bus can accommodate 2 students per seat, then we need 4904 / 2 = 16 buses for the field trip."
Response: 36
Response: 4
Response: 46
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed to transport all 111 students, we need to divide the number of students by the capacity of each bus (which is 3 seats). Therefore, the number of buses required = 111 / 3 = 4."
"Response: 50
Explanation:
If there are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students at the school, then each bus can accommodate approximately 2 students per seat (based on the number of seats available in each bus). Therefore, if all the buses are full, there will be 46 x 2 = 92 students on each bus."
Response:  If Haley has 9 marbles to give for each boy in her class of 11 boys, then she will have a total of 9 x 11 = 99 marbles.
Response: 5
"Response: 7/4 = 1.75
Explanation: To determine how many marbles each boy will receive, we need to divide the total number of marbles available (23) by the number of boys in the class (4). Since there are 4 boys in the class, each boy will receive 23 / 4 = 17.5 marbles."
Response:  The number of marbles each boy will receive is given by the ratio of the total number of boys who like playing soccer to the total number of boys who like playing cards. Since there are 13 boys who like playing soccer and 50 boys who like playing cards, the ratio is 13:50 or 1:4. Therefore, each boy will receive 4 marbles.

"Response: 17
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Frank has been reading his favorite book for 220 days and the book has 555 pages divided equally into 5 chapters. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is:

Number of pages = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 / 5
= 111 pages per chapter

So, there are 17 chapters in total (since Frank took 220 days to finish the book)."
"Response: 24
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Frank has to read 193 pages of his book and there are 15 chapters in total. Since he needs 660 days to finish reading the book, we can calculate the number of pages he reads per day as follows:
Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken to finish reading the book
= 193 pages / 660 days
= 24 pages/day
Therefore, Frank reads 24 pages of his book every day."
"Response: 738

Explanation:
Frank needs 3 days to complete each book, and each book has 249 pages. Therefore, he will read 249 x 3 = 738 pages in total over the 3 days."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
According to the question, it takes Frank 12 days to finish each book and he reads 66 pages per day. Therefore, if he takes 492 days to finish all the books, there must be 30 books in total."

Response: 1275 halaman (per hari)
"Response: 1285 halaman (3 x 594 = 1772; 1772 / 607 = 1285)"
"Response: 13
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Frank spent 664 days reading his book. If there are two chapters with 405 pages each, then Frank read 810 pages per day (2 x 405 = 810). Therefore, he read 13 chapters per day (810 / 66 = 13)."

Response:  $2670
"Response: 4
Explanation:
If each DVD package costs $107, and there is a discount of $106 for each package, then the total cost per package after applying the discount would be $93 ($106 - $10 = $93). To find out how many packages you can buy with $93, divide the amount by the cost per package: $93 / $93 = 4 packages."
"Response:  $14
Explanation:
To find out how much you need to pay for each package of DVDs with a discount of $25 per bundle, we can use the following formula:

Total cost = (Number of packages x Price per package) - Discount amount

In this case, the price per package is $76, and the number of packages is unknown. To find out how many packages you need to buy to get the discount, we can divide the total cost by the discount amount:

$14 = ($76 x Number of packages) - $25

Solving for Number of packages, we get:

Number of packages = $14 / ($76 - $25)
= $14 / $51
= 2.75 packages

So, to buy each package of DVDs with a discount of $25 per bundle, you would need to pay $14 for 2.75 packages, or approximately 50% off the original price."

Response:  There are 9 groups of size 3 each in Philip's collection of bananas.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Philip has collected 140 groups of bananas, and each group contains 187 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas that Philip has is:

140 x 187 = 23,600 bananas

So, Philip has 23,600 bananas in his collection."
"Response:  The number of groups of 7 pesang and 95 groups of 63 jeruk in Philip's collection are:
Pisang: 7 x 203 = 1411
Jeruk: 95 x 63 = 5895"
"Response:  The number of groups of bananas and oranges in Philip's collection can be found as follows:
Number of groups of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group
= 142 / 47
= 3

Therefore, there are 3 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.

Similarly, to find the number of groups of oranges, we can use the following formula:
Number of groups of oranges = Total number of oranges / Number of oranges per group
= 356 / 178
= 2

Therefore, there are 2 groups of oranges in Philip's collection."
"Response: 40-50
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Since each group contains 392 bananas, the size of each group is approximately 40-50 bananas."
Response:  There are 10 groups of 18 pieces of banana in Philip's collection.
"Response:  The number of groups of bananas and pineapples in Philip's collection can be formed as follows:

Number of groups of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group
= 290 / 10 (assuming 10 bananas per group)
= 29 groups of bananas

Similarly, the number of groups of pineapples can be calculated as follows:

Number of groups of pineapples = Total number of pineapples / Number of pineapples per group
= 87 / 9 (assuming 9 pineapples per group)
= 9 groups of pineapples

Therefore, there are 29 groups of bananas and 9 groups of pineapples in Philip's collection."
"Response:  The number of groups of 345 pieces of banana and 16 pieces of orange in Philip's collection is:

Groups of bananas = 345 x 16 = 5,440

Response: 50 botol soda biasa.
"Response: 39
Explanation: The total number of bottles of soda that the store has is 22 + 61 = 83. Since the store has more than twice as many diet sodas as regular sodas (61 / 22 = 3), there are 39 more diet bottles than regular bottles."
Response:  They have 71 bottles (30 regular + 8 diet + 41 apples).
Response:  The toko kelontong has 79 bottles of regular soda, so they have 79 - 53 = 26 more bottles of regular soda than Diet soda. Therefore, they have 26 + 42 = 68 bottles of regular soda in total.
Response:  The toko kelontong has 83 bottles of regular soda, so they have 83 - 54 = 29 more bottles of regular soda than Diet Soda. Therefore, they have 83 + 12 = 95 bottles of regular soda in total.
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the toko kelontong has 9 bottles of regular soda and 8 bottles of diet soda, for a total of 17 bottles. Since 9 of these are regular soda bottles, that means there are 8 diet soda bottles (8/9 = 0.88 or approximately 88%). Therefore, the toko kelontong has 88% of their bottles as diet soda, which is equal to 5 bottles (88% x 17 bottles = 5 bottles)."
Response:  The family has 79 bottles of soda (19 Diet + 60 Regular).
Response: 40 more bottles of soda than apples.
Response: 27 more bottles of soda than apples.
Response:  They have 7 bottles of Diet Soda.
Response: 31
Response: 100 botols
Response:  The number of bottles of regular soda that the store has is 81, and the number of bottles of diet soda is 60. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottles of regular soda and diet soda is:  81 - 60 = 21. So, the store has 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.

Response:  If there were 295 visitors to the palace yesterday and 317 visitors today, then the difference in the number of visitors between today and yesterday is 317 - 295 = 22. Therefore, there are 22 more visitors to the palace today compared to yesterday.
"Response: 1894

Explanation:
If there were 703 visitors to the palace on the previous day and Rachel knows that 246 people visited the palace on the day of their visit, then the total number of visitors to the palace in the past 25 days can be calculated as follows:

Total visitors = Number of visitors on the previous day x Number of days since the previous day
= 703 x (25 - 1)
= 1894

Therefore, the answer is 1894."
"Response: 234
Explanation: If there were 100 visitors to the palace on the previous day and 666 visitors on the current day, then the difference between the two days is 234 (666 - 100). Therefore, there are 234 more visitors to the palace on the current day compared to the previous day."
"Response:  If 406 people visited the palace in 327 days, then the average number of visitors per day is:

$$ \text {Average number of visitors per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of visitors}}{ \text{Number of days}} $$
= $\frac{406}{327}$
= $1.25$

Therefore, approximately 1.25 visitors visit the palace every day."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there were 45 visitors to the Palace of Versailles on the day before, and 829 visitors in total over the past 85 days. Therefore, on the day in question, there were (829 - 45) = 784 visitors to the palace.
"Response: 26043
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to the palace in the previous days is x. Since there are 71 paintings in the palace, and 557 visitors came on the day they visited, we can write the equation:
x + 557 = 71
Now, let's solve for x using substitution method:
x = 71 - 557
x = -486
Since negative numbers cannot be used as the number of visitors to the palace, we will set x = 0. Therefore, the total number of visitors to the palace in the previous 57 days is:
Total visitors = x \* 57 = 0 \* 57 = 0
So, the answer is 0."
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors to the palace on the previous day and 661 visitors came on the day of the meal, then the difference in the number of visitors between the two days is:

661 - 600 = 61

So, there were 61 more visitors to the palace on the day of the meal compared to the previous day."
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before the day in question is 419 + 103 = 522 people.
Response:  The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in the last 89 days is:  512 + 808 = 1320 visitors.
"Response: 368

Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* On the day they visited Buckingham Palace, 705 people came to visit.
* The previous day, there were 191 visitors.
* The day before that, there were 457 visitors.

Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day of their visit compared to the previous day and the day before that:

More visitors on the day of their visit = 705 - 191 = 514
More visitors on the day of their visit compared to the previous day = 514 - 457 = 167

So, there were 167 more visitors at Buckingham Palace on the day of their visit compared to the previous day, and 368 more visitors compared to the day before that (457 - 191 = 266)."

"Response: 12
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 90 laci of anggur to be filled in 6 days. Since each day has 24 hours, we can calculate the number of tongs (bottles) that need to be filled per hour as follows:

Number of tongs to be filled per day = Number of laci / 24 hours
= 90 / 24
= 3.75

Since there are 6 days in total, we can calculate the total number of tongs that need to be filled as follows:

Total number of tongs to be filled = Number of tongs to be filled per day x Number of days
= 3.75 x 6
= 22.5

Therefore, the answer is 12 tongs per hour."
"Response: 18
Explanation:
If it takes 5 days to fill 90 lacs of wine barrels and there are 266 peasants working on it, then each day they will be able to fill 90/266 = 3.47 lacs of wine barrels per day. Therefore, the number of tongs needed to fill the barrels in one day is 3.47 x 18 = 62.6 tongs per day."
"Response: 3085

Explanation:
To find out how many bottles of anggur will be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of liters of anggur that is being produced each day by the number of days. The production rate for anggur is given as 244 liters per day, and the total number of days is 146. Therefore, the answer is:

3085 = 244 x 146

So, there will be 3085 bottles of anggur filled in 146 days."
Response: 77 x 100 = 7700 laras raspberry and 77 x 221 = 16977 laras anggur. Therefore, there will be 7700 + 16977 = 24677 laras of grapes filled in the barrels during the 77 days.
"Response: 3460

Explanation:
To find out how many tongs of wine will be filled in 58 days, we need to multiply the number of laras of grapes that are filled each day by the number of days. Since there are 108 laras of grapes filled each day and there are 58 days, we have:

3460 (answer) = 108 x 58

Therefore, there will be 3460 tongs of wine filled in 58 days."
"Response: 15 days
Explanation:
To determine how many days it would take to fill 240 tongs of wine, we need to divide the total number of tongs by the number of tongs filled each day. According to the problem, there are 36 pickers who can fill 8 tongs of wine per day, so the total number of tongs filled each day is 36 x 8 = 288 tongs. To fill 240 tongs, it would therefore take 240 / 288 = 15 days."

"Response: 36
Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that there are 79 animals in the enclosure, consisting of 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles. If 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles are hiding, then the number of animals not hiding is:
79 - (24 x 1) = 79 - 24 = 55
Therefore, there are 55 animals not hiding in the enclosure."
Response:  There are 97 tomatoes left after today.
"Response: 83
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Yesterday (kemarin), the farmer took 56 tomatoes from his garden.
* Today (hari ini), he took 41 tomatoes from his garden.

So, the total number of tomatoes taken by the farmer is:
56 + 41 = 97

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes are left after the farmer has taken some of them. The answer is:
97 - 56 = 41

Therefore, there are 41 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after he has taken 56 and 41 tomatoes."
"Response: 204
Explanation: According to the question, the farmer took 154 tomatoes yesterday and 50 today, so he has taken a total of 204 tomatoes (154 + 50)."
"Response: 36
Explanation: If the farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden, and he picks 172 potatoes, then there are 3 tomatoes left (175 - 172 = 3)."
"Response: 94
Explanation: If the farmer has 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden, and he picks 53 tomatoes, then there are 12 x 100 = 1200 remaining tomatoes. Since the question asks for the number of tomatoes and potatoes that remain after the farmer picks 53 tomatoes, we can conclude that there are 1200 - 53 = 1147 tomatoes left in the garden, as well as 12 potatoes."
"Response: 48
Explanation: If the farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, together they have 176 tomatoes in total (105 + 71 = 176). If he picks 137 tomatoes, then there are 48 tomatoes left (176 - 137 = 48)."

Response: 204 paku (13 x 17 + 8)
"Response: 24
Explanation: To determine how many pieces of wood John needs to buy for the wall, we need to calculate the total number of paku required based on the information given in the problem. Since each papan (wooden board) requires 3 paku for cutting and an additional 8 paku are used as extra, we can use the following calculation: Total number of paku needed = Number of papans x Number of paku per papan + Additional paku needed. Substituting the values from the problem into this equation gives us: Total number of paku needed = 11 x 3 + 8 = 24 Therefore, John needs 24 pieces of wood for the wall."

Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of apples the chef had was x. After making some pies and using them, the number of apples left is equal to the original amount minus the number used. So, we can write an equation based on the information given in the question:
x - 35 = 58
Now, let's solve for x (the initial number of apples):
x = 58 + 35
x = 93
Therefore, there are 23 apples remaining with the chef."

Response:  The total number of shelves (rak) in Adam's room is 8. Therefore, there are 8 x 10 = 80 action figures that can be placed in his room.
Response:  The number of action figures that can be placed in each shelf is 8. Therefore, the total number of action figures that can be placed in all four shelves is 8 x 4 = 32. Similarly, the total number of dressers that can be placed in all four shelves is 10 x 4 = 40. So, the total number of barang (action figures and dressers) that can be placed in the room is 32 + 40 = 72.

To determine how many groups of 154 Skittles and penghapus each there are in total, we need to divide the total number of Skittles (4502) by 154. This gives us:

4502 / 154 = 29

So, there are 29 groups of 154 Skittles and penghapus each."
"Response: 76
Explanation: To determine how many groups of 495 Skittles there are in Steven's collection, we need to divide the total number of Skittles (4941) by 495. Since dividing by zero is undefined, we will round up to the nearest integer, which gives us 76 groups of 495 Skittles each."
"Response: 24
Explanation:
To determine how many groups of Skittles can be formed based on the information provided, we need to divide the total number of Skittles by the maximum number of Skittles that can be in each group. Since there are 896 Skittles in total and 8 is the maximum number of Skittles per group, we can divide 896 by 8 to get the number of groups:

896 ÷ 8 = 112
Therefore, there are 112 groups of Skittles that can be formed based on the information provided."
