Explanation: Let's break down what we know about Bobby and his candy:
* He initially had 36 pieces of candy (the total number of candies he has).
* He ate 17 pieces of candy (the number of candies he ate in one go).
* After eating 17 pieces, he had 36 - 17 = 19 pieces left (the number of candies he still had).
* Then, he ate another 15 pieces of candy (the additional amount he ate after having already eaten 17 pieces).
* So, after eating 15 more pieces of candy, he had 19 - 15 = 4 pieces left (the number of candies he still had).
Therefore, Bobby had 9 pieces of candy left after eating both 17 and 15 pieces."

Explanation:
Each basket has 19 red cherries and 4 green cherries, so there are 19 x 15 = 285 baskets of red cherries. Additionally, there are 4 x 15 = 60 baskets of green cherries. Therefore, the total number of cherries is 285 + 60 = 372."
"Response: 25
Explanation:
From the problem statement, we know that there are 10 balls in total and each basket has an equal number of red and green balls. Therefore, if there are x baskets, then the total number of red balls is 4x, and the total number of green balls is 6x. Since there are 10 balls in total, we can set up the equation:

4x + 6x = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10x = 10

Therefore, there are 10 baskets."

"Response: 16 books
Explanation:
According to the question, initially there were 2 action figures and 10 books on the bookshelf. Later, 4 more action figures were added to the bookshelf, but no new books were introduced.

"Response: 16
Explanation:
Jerry initially had 9 action figure toys on his bookshelf. Then he added 7 more action figures, so there are now 9 + 7 = 16 action figure toys on his bookshelf. Since Jerry still has 10 books on his bookshelf, we can conclude that there are 16 action figure toys for every 10 books on his bookshelf."
"Response: 5
Explanation:
According to the question, initially, Jere had 3 books and 4 action figures on his bookshelf. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the bookshelf, so now there are 3 + 2 = 5 action figures that are not books."
"Response: 10 books
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Jere has 7 books and 3 action figures on his bookshelf initially. Later, he adds 2 more action figures to the bookshelf, so now there are 7 + 2 = 9 items in total on the bookshelf. Therefore, the number of books on the bookshelf is 7 - 3 = 4 more than the number of action figures. Hence, there are 4 more books on the bookshelf than action figures."

Response:  There are currently 5 + 2 = 7 birds and storks sitting on the fence.
"Response: 5
Explanation: Let's analyze the situation:
There are initially 3 birds and 4 crows (which are larger than birds). So, there are 7 creatures in total sitting on the perch.
When 2 more birds come, there are now 9 creatures in total (including the original 7):

* Birds: 3 + 2 = 5
* Crows: 4 + 0 = 4

So, there are 5 birds and 4 crows sitting on the perch."
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the situation:
Initially, there are 2 birds and 6 crows on the perch. So, the total number of birds is 2 + 6 = 8.
Then, 3 more birds come to join them. This means that now there are 8 + 3 = 11 birds in total.
Since we know that all the birds are either birds or crows, we can conclude that among these 11 birds, there must be at least as many crows as there were initially (i.e., 6). Therefore, the remaining 5 birds must be birds.
So, the final count of birds sitting on the perch is 6 (crows) + 5 (birds) = 11."
"Response: 8
Explanation: Initially, there are 4 birds and 6 cranes sitting on the perch. When 2 more cranes come to join them, the total number of cranes sitting on the perch becomes 8."

Explanation:
Initially, there were 6 birds and 3 cranes (which are also birds). So, the total number of birds is 6 + 3 = 9. When 2 more cranes joined them, the total number of birds remained the same at 9. Therefore, the answer is 9 birds are sitting on the fence."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
There are initially 4 birds and 3 storks, so there are 7 total birds sitting on the fence. When 6 more storks come to join them, there are now 13 birds (including the original 4) and 3 storks, for a total of 16 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 9 birds for every 5 storks sitting on the fence."
Response: 10 (birds)
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's analyze the situation:
Initially, there were 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds and 4 cranes joined them. So, in total, there are:
2 + 5 = 7 birds sitting on the fence.
Since cranes are larger than birds, they take up more space on the fence. Therefore, there are:
7 - 4 = 3 birds that are smaller than cranes and sitting on the fence."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
Let's analyze the situation:
Initially, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds joined them, making it 5 birds in total. Later, 6 hawks arrived and sat with the other birds on the fence, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (including the hawks). Therefore, there are 9 birds sitting on the fence (excluding the hawks)."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's analyze the situation:
Initially, there are 5 storks and 3 birds sitting on the fence. So, the total number of birds is 5 + 3 = 8.
Then, 4 more birds come to join them. So, the total number of birds now is 8 + 4 = 12.
Since there are already 5 storks sitting on the fence, we need to find out how many birds are sitting on the fence more than the number of storks. In other words, we need to subtract the number of storks from the total number of birds.
So, the number of birds sitting on the fence more than the number of storks is: 12 - 5 = 7.
Therefore, there are 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence."
"Response: 6
Explanation: At first, there are 6 cranes and 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds come to join them, so now there are 9 birds (including the original 2) and still 6 cranes. Therefore, there are 6 cranes more than birds sitting on the fence."
"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the situation:
Initially, there are 3 birds sitting on the fence.
Then, 6 crows and 2 birds join them.
So, in total, there are 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 birds sitting on the fence.
Since there are more crows than birds, we can conclude that there are more crows than birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, the number of crows exceeding birds is 10 (11 - 3)."

Response: 73 (41 + 26)
"Response: 20 (or 21)
Explanation:
The number of people who went sailing in the morning is 43. Since some more people went sailing in the afternoon, let's assume that there are x additional people who went sailing. Therefore, the total number of people who went sailing in one day is 43 + x.
Since we know that there were 46 people in total, including those who didn't go sailing, we can set up the equation:
43 + x = 46
Solving for x, we get:
x = 3
So, there were 3 additional people who went sailing in the afternoon."

At first, there were 2 apples on the tree. Then, she picked 4 apples from the tree. So, after she picked them, there were 2 + 4 = 6 apples left on the tree. Later, 3 new apples grew on the tree, so now there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree in total."
"Response: 34
Explanation: Let's call the number of apples on the tree initially ""x"". Since 瑞秋 took 2 apples from the tree, we know that x - 2 = 7 (the number of apples left on the tree). Now, we can solve for x using basic arithmetic: x = 7 + 2 = 9. So, there were originally 9 apples on the tree."
"Response: 27
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* 瑞秋 (Rachel) has 3 apple trees.
* From each tree, she picked 8 apples, so she got 3 x 8 = 24 apples.

Explanation: According to the question, Jack received 9 emails in total over one day. If he received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he received 3 emails in the afternoon."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning, for a total of 8 emails received during the daytime (morning + afternoon). In contrast, he received 16 emails in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails received during the daytime and the evening is 8 - 16 = -8 emails. Since this value is negative, it means that Jack received fewer emails in the morning than he did in the evening."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning, for a total of 9 emails. Since he also received some more emails in the evening, the total number of emails he received that day is 10. Therefore, he received 5 emails in the afternoon."

"Response: 42 inches
Explanation:
According to the question, the distance jumped by the frog is 17 inches more than the distance jumped by the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 42 inches (17 + 36 = 42)."
"Response: 40 inches
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The distance jumped by the grasshopper is 25 inches.
* The distance jumped by the frog is 18 inches more than the grasshopper's distance, which means the frog jumped 25 + 18 = 43 inches.
* The distance jumped by the mouse is 2 inches less than the frog's distance, which means the mouse jumped 43 - 2 = 41 inches.

Therefore, the distance jumped by the mouse is 41 inches."
Response: 30 inches (or 76 cm)
"Response:  Yes, 青蛙跳了多远。
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, 青蛙跳了39英寸，which is more than the distance jumped by 蚱蜢 (19英寸). Therefore, we can say that 青蛙跳了多远。"
"Response: 18
Explanation:
According to the question, the distance that the frog jumped was 32 inches more than the distance that the centipede jumped. So, if the centipede jumped 25 inches, then the frog jumped 32 + 25 = 57 inches.
Similarly, according to the question, the mouse jumped 26 inches less than the distance that the frog jumped. So, if the frog jumped 57 inches, then the mouse jumped 57 - 26 = 31 inches."
"Response: 10 inches
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
* The frog jumped more than the grasshopper and jumped 33 inches.
* The mouse jumped less than the frog by 5 inches.

So, we can conclude that the distance between the mouse and the frog is equal to the difference between their jumps. That means:

Distance = Frog's jump - Mouse's jump
= 33 - 28
= 5 inches

Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the frog is 5 inches."
"Response: 5 inches
Explanation: According to the question, the grasshopper jumped 13 inches and the frog jumped far beyond that by 2 inches, which means the frog jumped 15 inches (13 + 2 = 15)."
"Response: 109 inches
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 蚱蜢 (Frog) jumped 35 inches.
* 蚱蜢 (Frog) and Green Frog together jumped a total of 4 inches more than Frog.
* So, the total distance jumped by both frogs is 35 + 4 = 41 inches.
Therefore, the total distance jumped by both frogs is 41 inches or 109 inches (since there are 2 frogs)."
"Response: 30 inches
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
* The frog jumped 25 inches (since the frog jumped more than the grasshopper).
* The mouse jumped 16 inches (since the mouse jumped less than the frog and grasshopper).

Now, let's find out how far the frog jumped compared to the grasshopper:
Frog jumped 25 - Grasshopper jumped 19 = 6 inches
So, the frog jumped 6 inches more than the grasshopper.

Now, let's find out how far the mouse jumped compared to the frog:
Mouse jumped 16 - Frog jumped 25 = -9 inches
So, the mouse jumped 9 inches less than the frog.

Finally, we can find out how far the blue frog jumped by adding the distance it jumped with the distance the grasshopper jumped:
Blue frog jumped 25 + 19 = 44 inches
Therefore, the blue frog jumped 44 inches."
"Response: 45
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* The grasshopper jumped 39 inches.
* The frog jumped 19 inches more than the grasshopper (i.e., 39 + 19 = 58).
* The mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog (i.e., 58 - 12 = 46).

So, the distance traveled by the mouse is 46 inches. Therefore, the answer is 45."
"Response: 30 inches
Explanation:
According to the question, the distance jumped by the frog is 25 inches more than the distance jumped by the grasshopper. So, if the grasshopper jumps 21 inches, then the frog jumps 25 + 21 = 46 inches.
Similarly, the distance jumped by the mouse is 16 inches less than the distance jumped by the frog. So, if the frog jumps 46 inches, then the mouse jumps 46 - 16 = 30 inches."
"Response: 22 inches
Explanation:
According to the question, blue frog jumped 39 inches and cricket jumped 17 inches. To find out how many more inches blue frog jumped than cricket, we subtract the distance that cricket jumped from the distance that blue frog jumped:
39 - 17 = 22 inches
Therefore, blue frog jumped 22 inches more than cricket."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance jumped by the frog is 33 inches more than that of the mouse, and the distance jumped by the mouse is 3 inches less than that of the tortoise. Therefore, the distance jumped by the mouse is 30 inches (3 - 3 = 0 + 30). Since the frog jumped 9 inches more than the tortoise, the distance jumped by the mouse is equal to the sum of the distances jumped by the frog and the tortoise minus the distance jumped by the frog, which is 9 + 27 = 36 inches. So, the mouse jumped 10 inches far."
"Response: 50 inches
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* The distance jumped by the frog is 37 inches more than the distance jumped by the centipede. (Given)
* The distance jumped by the rat is less than the distance jumped by the frog by 16 inches. (Given)

Now, let's find out how much longer the rat jumped than the centipede:
Rat jumped x inches = Frog jumped - Centipede jumped
x = 37 - 16
x = 21 inches

So, the rat jumped 21 inches more than the centipede."
"Response: 9
Explanation: If Mary has already added 5 cups of flour and the recipe requires 14 cups in total, then she needs to add an additional 9 cups (14 - 5 = 9)."
Response: 7杯糖 (7 cups of sugar)
"Response: 40
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* Mary has already added some face powder to the mixture.
* The recipe requires 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar.
* To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required by the recipe.

So, the difference between the total amount of flour needed (13 - 6 = 7) and the amount Mary has already added (x) is equal to the number of additional cups of flour Mary needs to add.

We are also given that Mary still needs to add 8 cups of flour more than the amount she has already added. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Additional cups of flour = 8 - x

Now, we can solve for x by substituting the value of 8 into the equation:

X = 8 - (x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X = 8 - x

Solving for x, we get:

X = 40

Therefore, Mary needs to add 40 cups of flour more than what she has already added to the mixture."

"Response: 32
Explanation:
According to the passage, there are 19 bird families that stay in the mountainous area during winter. If 60 birds fly away for winter, then the number of bird families left behind is 19 - 60 = -41. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and the number of bird families left behind is 41."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 87 bird species that migrate during winter. If 7 of these species fly away for winter, then the number of bird species left behind is 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, there are 13 more bird species left behind than those that flew away for winter."
Response: 30 (the number of bird families that lived in the mountains initially)
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 85 bird species families in the mountains. If 23 bird species families fly away to Africa and 37 bird species families fly away to Asia, then the number of bird species families left in the mountains is:
85 - 23 = 62
62 - 37 = 25
Therefore, there are 25 bird species families left in the mountains."
"Response: 50 - 31 = 19
Explanation: There are 8 bird families that migrate to warmer countries in winter. If 42 bird families fly to Africa and 31 fly to Asia, then the number of bird families that fly to Africa is 42 more than the number that fly to Asia, which is 19."
"Response: 51
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 94 bird families that fly towards Asia and 47 bird families that fly towards Africa. Therefore, the number of bird families that fly towards Asia is 94 - 47 = 47 more than the number of bird families that fly towards Africa."
"Response: 46
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 18 bird families that migrate to warmer countries during winter. If 38 bird families fly towards Africa and 80 bird families fly towards Asia, then the total number of bird families that fly away is 38 + 80 = 118.
Since there were initially 18 bird families that migrated to warmer countries, this means that 118 - 18 = 100 bird families do not migrate. Therefore, the number of bird families that fly away during winter is 46 (100 - 18)."
"Response: 105
Explanation:
According to the question, there are currently 87 bird families living in the mountains nearby. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living in the mountains will be 87 + 18 = 105."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 49 bird families that stay in the mountain area during winter. Among them, 59 bird families migrate away from the mountain area, and 24 new bird families come from the North Pole to settle in the mountain area. Therefore, the number of bird families left in the mountain area is 49 - (59 + 24) = 16."
"Response: 34
Explanation:
According to the passage, there are 27 bird families that migrate from the mountain area during winter. This means that there were initially 41 bird families living in the mountain area (27 + 14 = 41). Therefore, there are 34 bird families left in the mountain area after migration (41 - 27 = 34)."
"Response: 41
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of bird families that stayed in the mountain is x. Since there are 86 bird families that flew away to warmer countries, the difference between the total number of bird families and the number of families that stayed is 86 - x = 45. Therefore, the number of bird families that flew away is equal to 45 + x.
Since the initial number of bird families was 45, we can set up the equation:
x + (45 + x) = 86
Simplifying the equation:
2x + 45 = 86
Subtracting 45 from both sides:
2x = 41
Dividing by 2:
x = 20
Therefore, 20 bird families stayed in the mountain."
"Response: 
Let's denote the number of bird families that fly to Asia as x and the number of bird families that fly to Africa as y. We know that x + y = 41 (total number of bird families) and x + 2y = 62 (total number of bird families that fly to either Africa or Asia).
Solving for y, we get:
y = 62 - x
Now, we can find out how many more bird families flew to Africa than to Asia by subtracting x from y:
Difference = y - x
= 62 - x
Therefore, there are 20 more bird families that flew to Africa than to Asia."

Therefore, Robert lost or gave away 43 pencils."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Paul received 521 pencils and 66 erasers at the beginning of the school year. If he only had 154 pencils left by the end of the school year without losing or sending any erasers, then he must have lost or sent 37 pencils."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 531 pencils and 38 erasers at the beginning of the school year. If he didn't lose any erasers, then he must have had 531 - 38 = 493 pencils left by the end of the school year. Therefore, there are 22 more pencils than erasers left with Paul at the end of the school year."
"Response: 265
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Robert received 601 pencils and 406 erasers. (Total = 1007)
* By the end of the school year, he had 336 erasers left. (Remaining = 336)

Now, let's find out how many erasers Robert had initially:
Total number of erasers = 406 + Remaining erasers = 406 + 336 = 742

So, Robert had 742 erasers initially, and he lost 256 erasers during the school year.
Therefore, the difference between the initial number of erasers and the remaining number of erasers is:
Difference = Initial number - Remaining number = 742 - 336 = 406

Hence, Robert had 406 more erasers than pencils at the beginning of the school year."

"Response: 95
Explanation:
According to the question, Paul received 267 pencils and lost 231 pencils during his academic year. This means he has 36 (267 - 231) pencils left with him. He then sent 308 pencils as gifts to his friends, which is more than the number of pencils he had left with him. Therefore, the difference between the number of pencils he gave away and the number of pencils he had left with him is 308 - 36 = 95 pencils."
"Response: 198
Explanation: According to the question, Paul received 457 rubber erasers and 320 pencils at the beginning of the school year. By the end of the school year, he had 523 erasers left, which means he used 134 erasers during the year (523 - 457 = 134). Since he didn't lose any erasers, he must have used all 134 erasers to sharpen his pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils he has left is 320 - 134 = 186 pencils."

"Response: 63 dollars
Explanation:
Olivia has $78 in her wallet and spends $15 at the supermarket. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount of money she had: $78 - $15 = $63."
"Response: 100 - 78 = 22
Therefore, Olivia initially had $22."
"Response: 31
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 奥利维亚的钱包里有100美元 (initial amount of money in Olivia's wallet)
* 她从ATM机上取了148美元 (amount withdrawn from ATM)
* 她去超市后还剩下159美元 (remaining amount after shopping)

Now, let's calculate how much money Olivia spent:

Total amount withdrawn = 148 + 159 = 267

Subtracting the initial amount from the total amount withdrawn gives us the amount spent by Olivia:

Amount spent = 267 - 100 = 167

Therefore, the answer is $31."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
Olivia withdrew $49 from an ATM after buying groceries, leaving her with $3 in her wallet. To find out how much more she withdrew than she spent at the store, we subtract the amount she spent ($49) from the total amount she withdrew ($49 + $49 = $98). Therefore, Olivia withdrew $56 more than she spent at the store."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 奥利维亚的钱包里有106美元 (initial amount of money)
* 她去了一家超市和一家展厅后，剩下了26美元 (amount left after visiting both places)
* 如果她在展厅花了49美元 (cost of visiting the museum)

Now let's calculate how much money Oliva spent at each place:

Supermarket: $26 - $49 = $-23
Museum: $49

So, Oliva spent $23 less than the cost of visiting the museum at the supermarket. Therefore, the answer is $38."
"Response: 31美元
Explanation:
According to the question, after Olivia went shopping and spent money, she had $29 left. If her wallet initially contained $54, then she must have spent $29 + $54 = $83. Therefore, the amount of money Olivia spent is $83."

Response: 14 applications remain on David's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
Response: 23 (initial number of applications)
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, David initially had 10 applications on his phone and then added 11 new ones. After deleting some of them, he was left with 4 applications. Therefore, the number of applications that David deleted is 5 (10 - 4 = 5)."
"Response: 37
Explanation:
Let's call the number of applications Dave had initially as x. Since he added 89 new applications, the total number of applications he had after that is x + 89 = 110.
Now, let's find out how many applications he deleted by subtracting 24 from the total number of applications he had after adding new ones:
x + 89 - 24 = 110
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 37
Therefore, Dave added 53 more applications than he deleted."
"Response: 63 - 7 = 56
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* David has 15 applications on his phone initially.
* He adds 71 new applications to his phone.
* He deletes some of the applications, leaving him with 14 applications remaining.

So, the number of applications that David deleted is equal to the number of applications he added minus the number of applications he left with (14).

In other words, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number of applications he deleted is equal to the number of applications he had initially.

Therefore, the answer is:
56 (the number of applications he had initially) - 7 (the number of applications he deleted) = 56."
"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, David had 16 applications and 77 files initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. To find out how many applications David deleted, we can subtract the number of remaining applications (5) from the initial number of applications (16): 16 - 5 = 11. Therefore, David deleted 11 applications."
"Response: 21 - 7 = 14
Explanation: The original number of files was 21, and after deleting some applications and files, David only had 7 remaining files left. To find out how many files were deleted, we subtract the number of remaining files (7) from the original number of files (21), which gives us 14 as the answer."
"Response: 16 - 8 = 8
Explanation:
The original number of applications was 15, and after deleting some, he had 21 remaining applications. The original number of files was 24, and after deleting some, he had 4 remaining files. Therefore, the difference between the number of applications and files is 21 - 4 = 17."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
According to the question, David had 19 applications and 18 files on his mobile phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. Therefore, the number of files remaining on his mobile phone is 15 - 18 = -3. Since negative numbers are not allowed in Coding Ninja questions, we round down to 0. So, there are 0 more files than applications on David's mobile phone."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 17 applications on his phone before adding some more. After adding those additional apps, he still had 18 applications left on his phone. Therefore, the number of applications that Dave added is 3 (18 - 17 = 3)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, David had 15 applications and 59 files on his phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 12 applications and 30 files. Therefore, David deleted 7 applications from his phone."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, David had 24 files and 13 applications before deleting some of them. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. To find out how many files he deleted, we can subtract the number of files he had after deleting from the total number of files he had initially: 21 - 24 = -3. Therefore, David deleted 3 files."
"Response: 7
Explanation:
According to the question, David had 24 applications and 9 files on his mobile phone initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. Therefore, the number of applications remaining on his phone is 12 - 9 = 3 more than the number of files remaining, which is 5 + 3 = 8."
"Response: 24 - 3 = 21

Explanation:
The original number of files was 11 + 3 = 14. After deleting some applications and files, he had 24 remaining files and 2 remaining applications. Therefore, the difference between the total number of files and applications is 24 - 3 = 21."
"Response: 106
Explanation: According to the question, Nell has 242 baseball cards and she gave Jeff 136 cards. Therefore, Nell still has 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106)."
"Response: 301
Explanation: According to the question, Nell initially had 301 baseball cards and gave 301 of them (all of them) to Jeff. This means that she started with 301 cards and now has none left."
"Response: 407
Explanation: According to the question, Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave Jeff some of them. Now she has 252 left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is 528 - 252 = 276."
"Response: 298
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Nell had 566 baseball cards initially and gave some to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she still has 535 cards left. So, the number of baseball cards that Jeff now has is equal to the difference between Nell's initial number of cards and her current number of cards minus the number of cards she gave to Jeff. Therefore, the answer is 566 - 234 = 298."
"Response: 277
Explanation: According to the question, Nell has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card packs left after giving some to Jeff. This means she had a total of 564 cards (415 + 149) initially. Since she gave Jeff some cards, let's assume she gave him x cards. Then, the number of cards Nell has left is 564 - x. Since Nell has 309 baseball cards, we can set up the equation: 564 - x = 309. Solving for x, we get x = 277. Therefore, Nell has 277 more baseball cards than ten-card packs."
"Response: 311
Explanation:
Let's first calculate the total number of cards that Nell has:
Total number of cards = Number of baseball cards + Number of 10-card packs
= 246 + 214
= 460
Now, let's see how many cards Nell gave to Jeff:
Number of cards given to Jeff = Total number of cards - Number of cards left with Nell
= 460 - 404
= 56
So, Nell has 56 fewer 10-card packs than she had initially. Since each pack contains 10 cards, Nell has 560 - 56 = 504 cards left.
Therefore, Nell has 311 more baseball cards than 10-card packs."
"Response: 120
Explanation: According to the question, Nell gave John 195 cards and some other cards to Jeff. This means that she had 573 - 195 = 378 cards left after giving them away. Then, she gave Jeff some more cards, which is equal to 210 - 120 = 90 cards. Therefore, Jeff received 120 cards from Nell."
"Response: 126
Explanation: According to the question, Nell has 18 10-card and 438 baseball cards. She gave some of them to Jeff, leaving her with 55 10-cards and 178 baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than 10-cards, we can subtract the number of 10-cards she has from the total number of baseball cards she has: 178 - 55 = 123. So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than 10-cards."
"Response: 111 - 38 = 73
There are 73 cards of baseball in Nell's hand after giving some to Jeff."

"Response: 13
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paco has 40 pieces of bread.
* He eats 2 pieces, leaving him with 38 pieces (40 - 2 = 38).
* Then he buys 37 more pieces of bread, bringing his total to 75 pieces (38 + 37 = 75).

So, Paco has 75 pieces of bread left after buying the additional 37 pieces."
"Response: 18
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paco has 25 pieces of bread.
* He eats 5 pieces. (So he has 25 - 5 = 20 left)
* Then, he buys 3 more pieces of bread. (So he has 20 + 3 = 23 now)

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of bread Paco ate in total. We can do this by subtracting the number of pieces he bought from the original amount he had:

23 - 3 = 20

Therefore, Paco ate 20 pieces of bread in total."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paco has 13 pieces of bread.
* He eats 2 pieces. (So he has 13 - 2 = 11 pieces left)
* Then, he buys 36 more pieces of bread.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces of bread Paco has in total:

Paco had 11 pieces of bread initially + 36 new pieces of bread = 47 pieces of bread in total.

Therefore, the difference between the number of pieces of bread Paco bought and the number of pieces he already had is 47 - 11 = 36."

"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Paco has 12 pieces of bread.
* He eats 16 pieces of bread, leaving him with 12 - 16 = -4 pieces of bread. (Note that this is a negative number because he has fewer pieces of bread than he started with.)
* He gives his friend 21 pieces of bread, which means his friend now has 21 + (-4) = 17 pieces of bread.

So, the difference between the number of pieces of bread Paco gave to his friend and the number he had left after eating some is 17 - 12 = 5 pieces of bread."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Paco has 22 pieces of sweet bread and 75 pieces of salty bread. He ate 15 pieces of sweet bread and 54 pieces of salty bread, leaving him with 22 - 15 = 6 pieces of sweet bread left."
Response: 帕科还剩下5块咸饼干。
"Response: 30 - 11 = 19
Paco has 37 pieces of sweet bread and 11 pieces of salty bread. He ate 5 pieces of sweet bread and 2 pieces of salty bread, so he has 37 - 5 = 32 pieces of sweet bread left and 11 - 2 = 9 pieces of salty bread left. Therefore, he has more sweet bread than salty bread by 32 - 9 = 23 pieces."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Paco has eaten 20 pieces of sweet bread and 34 pieces of salty bread. To find out how many more pieces of salty bread he ate than sweet bread, we can subtract the number of sweet bread from the total number of bread he ate:
34 - 20 = 14
So, Paco ate 14 more pieces of salty bread than sweet bread."

Response: 9 buns remaining.
"Response: 23
Explanation: If Paco has 41 pieces of bread and gives 9 to his friends, then he has 41 - 9 = 32 pieces of bread left. He eats 18 pieces of bread, so there are 32 - 18 = 14 pieces of bread left."
"Response: 17
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Paco has 6 pieces of bread (baguette).
He gave his friends 30 pieces of bread (baguette), which means he had 30 - 6 = 24 pieces left.
He ate 23 pieces of bread himself, so he had 24 - 23 = 1 piece left.
Therefore, the number of pieces of bread that Paco gave to his friend is 30 - 23 = 7 more than the number of pieces he ate himself. In other words, he gave his friend 7 more pieces of bread than he ate himself."

"Response: 8
Explanation:
At the bus station, there were initially 2 children. Then, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number of children to 10. Therefore, there are 8 children who got off at the bus stop before the bus arrived at the station (10 - 2 = 8)."
Response: 64 (26 + 38)
"Response: 39
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""There are some children who get off at the bus stop."" (This means that there were initially some children on the bus.)
* ""Then two more children got on the bus."" (This means that the number of children on the bus increased by 2.)
* ""After that, there were 41 children on the bus."" (This means that the total number of children on the bus is now 41.)

Now, let's use logic to find out how many children were on the bus before they got off at the bus stop:

Total number of children = Initial number of children + Number of children who got on the bus after getting off at the bus stop
= 0 (since no children got off at the bus stop) + 2
= 39

So, there were 39 children on the bus before they got off at the bus stop."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 43 children on the bus. Then, some of them got off at the station, leaving 21 children still on the bus. Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the station."
"Response: 23
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 41 children initially sitting in the bus.
* Some of them get off the bus at the station, leaving 18 children still on the bus.

Now, let's find out how many children were on the bus before they got off:

Total number of children = Initially there were 41 children
Children who got off = 18 (as mentioned in the problem)

So, the number of children who were on the bus before they got off is:
Total number of children - Children who got off = 41 - 18 = 23

Therefore, there were 23 children on the bus before they got off at the station."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, there are initially 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them get off at the station, leaving 11 children still on the bus. Finally, some of these 11 children get off the bus, leaving 16 children left on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the station is 10."
"Response: 9
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of children who sat in the bus = 5
Number of children who got off at the station = 63 - 5 = 58
Number of children who boarded the bus after getting off = 14
Now, let's find out how many more children boarded the bus than got off:
Total number of children who boarded the bus = Number of children who boarded the bus after getting off + Number of children who remained in the bus (i.e., did not get off)
= 14 + 58
= 72
So, there are 72 children who boarded the bus compared to the 58 children who got off. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who boarded and those who got off is 72 - 58 = 14."
"Response: 24
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Number of children who got off the bus = 68 - 12 = 56
Number of children who were already on the bus = 36
So, the difference between the number of children who got off and those who were already on the bus is 56 - 36 = 20.
Therefore, there are 20 more children who got off the bus than those who were already on it."
"Response: 18
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 22 children initially boarding the bus.
* 40 children get off the bus at the station.
* After some children get off the bus, there are only 2 children left on the bus.

Now, let's calculate the number of children who got off the bus:

Number of children who got off the bus = Total number of children - Number of children still on the bus
= 40 - 2
= 38

Therefore, 18 children got off the bus at the station."
"Response: 14
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 28 children sitting in the bus initially.
* 82 children get onto the bus at the station.
* Some of these children get off the bus later.
* Finally, there are 30 children left on the bus.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of children who got onto the bus and the number of children who were left on the bus:

Number of children who got onto the bus = 82
Number of children left on the bus = 30

So, the difference between the two numbers is:

Difference = Number of children who got onto the bus - Number of children left on the bus
= 82 - 30
= 52

Therefore, there are 52 more children who got onto the bus than those who were left on it."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 23 children who boarded the public bus. (From the question)
* There are 24 children who got off at the next stop. (From the question)
* There are 8 children left on the bus. (From the question)

Now, let's calculate the number of children who got off the bus:

24 - 23 = 1

So, there is one child who got off the bus.

Therefore, the answer is 16."

"Response: 308
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made some cakes. (Not specified how many)
* He sold 145 of them.
* He has 72 cakes left.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes the baker made:
Total cakes = Number of cakes made + Number of cakes sold
= x + 145
where x is the initial number of cakes made.

We know that the baker made some cakes initially, so we can write:
x > 0

Now, we have two equations:

1. Total cakes = x + 145
2. Number of cakes left = 72

Solving for x, we get:
x = 308

Therefore, the baker made 308 cakes in total."
"Response: 15 - 14 = 1

The baker made 110 breads and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 breads left (110 - 75 = 35). Then he made another 76 breads, so he now has 24 breads left (35 + 76 = 110)."
"Response: 43
Explanation:
The baker made 144 breads and sold 71 of them, leaving him with 73 remaining. Then he made 111 more breads, bringing the total number of breads he has to 184 (73 + 111). Therefore, the difference between the number of breads he made and the number he sold is 43 (184 - 71)."
"Response: 58
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 149 eggs and 91 points.
* He sold 10 eggs and 90 points.

149 - 10 = 139 eggs

So, the baker has 139 eggs left."
"Response: 296
Explanation:
The baker made 7 eggs and 148 cakes. If he sold 15 eggs and 103 cakes, then he has 296 cakes left."
"Response: 35
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The baker made 126 bread rolls and 48 pastries.
* He sold 115 bread rolls and 81 pastries.

So, the number of bread rolls that the baker did not sell is:

126 - 115 = 11

Therefore, the baker did not sell 11 bread rolls."
"Response: 53
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The baker made 19 eggs and 131 cakes. (So, he made a total of 150 items.)
* He sold 70 eggs and 88 cakes. (So, he sold a total of 158 items.)

Now, let's find out how many more cakes the baker sold than eggs:

Total number of cakes sold = 88
Total number of eggs sold = 70

Difference between cakes sold and eggs sold = 88 - 70 = 18

Therefore, the baker sold 18 more cakes than eggs."
"Response: 9
Explanation:
According to the question, the baker made 157 eggs and 169 cakes. If he sold 158 eggs and 147 cakes, then he sold more eggs than cakes by 9 (158 - 147 = 9)."
"Response: 
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The baker made 54 eggs and 143 cakes.
* He sold 68 eggs and 92 cakes.

Now, let's calculate the number of cakes he sold compared to the total number of cakes he made:

Number of cakes sold = 92 (cakes sold) / 143 (total number of cakes made) = 0.63

So, the baker sold 63% of his total number of cakes.

Therefore, the answer is 63%."

"Response: 74
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 173 eggs. (So he had 173 eggs to start with.)
* He bought 103 new eggs. (So he now has 276 eggs - 173 = 103.)
* He sold 86 eggs. (So he now has 276 - 86 = 190 eggs left.)

Therefore, the baker has 190 eggs left."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the question, the baker bought 167 new bread rolls and sold 89 of them, leaving him with 78 unused bread rolls. To find out how many more he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of bread rolls he sold from the number of bread rolls he bought: 167 - 89 = 78. Therefore, the baker bought 32 more bread rolls than he sold."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, the baker bought 139 eggs and sold 145 eggs. So, he sold more eggs than he bought by 6 eggs (145 - 139 = 6)."
"Response: 5
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The baker made 62 eggs.
* He then made another 149 eggs.
* He sold 144 of them.

So, the number of eggs the baker has left is:
62 + 149 - 144 = 5
Therefore, the baker has 5 eggs left."
"Response: 56
Explanation:
The baker made 81 eggs and then made another 92 eggs. He sold 46 of them, so he has 81 + 92 = 173 eggs left. Therefore, the number of eggs that the baker made more than he sold is 173 - 46 = 127 eggs."

"Response: 36 (rounded)
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The baker made 52 types of bread and 84 cakes.
* He sold 102 cakes and 94 bread rolls.

Now, let's calculate the number of bread rolls the baker made:
52 (bread rolls) + 84 (cakes) = 136

So, the baker made 36 more bread rolls than he sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of bread rolls he made and the number he sold is 36."
"Response: 92 - 134 = -42
Explanation: The baker sold 140 pieces of cake and 92 pieces of bread. If he had initially made 134 pieces of bread and 11 pieces of cake, then he must have added more bread to his inventory after selling some of it. Therefore, he has sold more bread than cake."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker made 14 eggs and 153 points. If he sold 8 points and 97 eggs, then the number of eggs he sold is 97 - 8 = 89. Therefore, the number of eggs he sold is twice the number of points he sold, which is 89 / 2 = 44. So, the baker sold 44 more eggs than points."
"Response: 62
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker made 43 eggs and 114 cakes. If he sold 154 cakes and 78 eggs, then the number of eggs he sold is 78 - 43 = 35. Therefore, the number of cakes he sold is 154 - 35 = 119. So, the number of extra cakes sold by the baker is 119 - 114 = 5 more than the number of cakes he made."

"Response: 100 - 91 = 9
So, Kaitlyn initially had 9 games."
"Response: 14
Explanation:
Kaitlyn has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To send away 12 Nintendo games, she needs to have at least 8 Nintendo games left (20 - 12 = 8). Since she has more than enough Sony games to cover this amount, she can send away 14 Sony games (70 - 12 = 58) without running out of any particular type of game."
"Response: 59
Explanation:
Kaitlyn has 132 Sony games and needs to send away 31 of them. To find out how many she will have left after sending away 31, we need to subtract 31 from 132. Therefore, Kaitlyn will have 59 Sony games left after sending away 31."
"Response: 29
Explanation:
If Kaitlyn has 80 Nintendo games and finds 31 of them, then she has 49 remaining games. To find out how many games she needs to send away to have 6 left, we can divide the number of remaining games by 6: 49 / 6 = 8. Therefore, Kaitlyn needs to send away 8 games to have 6 left."

Explanation: According to the question, Ludi has 37 blocks and uses 33 of them to build a tower. This means he has 4 blocks left over after building the tower. He then uses 13 of these remaining blocks to build a house. Therefore, the number of blocks used by Ludi to build the tower is 33, and the number of blocks used to build the house is 13, so the difference between the two numbers is 20 (33 - 13 = 20)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Ludi used 82 blocks to build a house and 79 blocks to build a tower. Therefore, the number of blocks he used for building the house is 82 - 79 = 3 more than the number of blocks he used for building the tower."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Ludi used 36 blocks to build a tower. If he has 59 blocks in total, then he must have used all of them to build the tower and there are no remaining blocks. Therefore, the number of blocks left is 0, which can be represented as 13 (since we are counting from 1)."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, Ludi used 50 blocks to build a tower and 20 blocks to build a house. Therefore, the number of blocks he used for the tower is 50 - 20 = 30 more than the number of blocks he used for the house."

"Response: 490
Explanation:
According to the passage, the farmers harvested 67 baskets of oranges per day, and each basket contains 12 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges harvested daily is 67 x 12 = 804 oranges. Since the farmer harvested 35 baskets in one day, he harvested a total of 35 x 12 = 420 oranges that day. So, the total number of oranges harvested over the period of time is 804 - 420 = 384 oranges."

"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the passage, they harvest 44 baskets of mature oranges and 25 baskets of immature oranges every day. Since there are 10 baskets in each basket, we can calculate the total number of mature oranges as follows: 44 x 10 = 440. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of immature oranges as follows: 25 x 10 = 250. Therefore, the difference between the number of mature and immature oranges is 440 - 250 = 190 baskets."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the passage, they harvest 5 baskets of mature oranges and 74 baskets of immature oranges every day. Since there are 10 baskets in each basket, we can calculate the number of immature oranges as follows:

"Response: 4 feet
Explanation: According to the question, Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer her room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, if the length of the room is 12 feet and the width is 11 feet, then the difference between the two is 1 foot (12 - 11 = 1). Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide."
Response: 3 feet.
Response: 9 feet.
"Response: 24 square feet
Explanation:
The room is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet in size. Since Jesse already has 16 square feet of carpet, she needs an additional 165 - 16 = 149 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
The length of Jesse's room is 2 feet, and its width is 12 feet. To cover the entire floor with tiles, we need to calculate the total area of the floor in square feet. The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the area of the floor is:
Area = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet
Since each tile has an area of 4 square feet, we can divide the total area of the floor by the area of one tile to find out how many tiles are needed:
Number of tiles = Total area / Area of one tile
= 24 / 4
= 6
Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the entire floor of her room."
Response: 40 square feet.
Response: 5 feet (or 60 inches)
Response: 6 feet (or 72 inches)
"Response: 48 feet
Explanation:
From the problem statement, we know that Jesse needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room. Since her room is wider than it is long, we can use the width of the room to determine the length of the room. The problem states that Jesse's room is 2 feet wide, so the length of the room must be twice as long, or 4 times as long if we convert feet to feet. Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 8 feet (or 32 feet)."
"Response: 36 square feet
Explanation:
Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet and her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To cover the entire floor, she needs 36 square feet of carpet (18 / 4 = 9 x 20)."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, if they sold one T-shirt for $23, then they sold 10 T-shirts during the competition in Arkansas and Texas. Therefore, the answer is 10."
Response:  $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt.
"Response: 302 dollars
Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The t-shirt store sells each t-shirt for $87.
* They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during both games (in Arkansas and Texas).
* If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas game (since the total number of t-shirts sold is 95).

So, the amount of money the store made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is:
$87 x 47 = $3,999

And the amount of money the store made from selling t-shirts during the Texas game is:
$87 x 48 = $4,161

Therefore, the total amount of money the store made from selling t-shirts during both games is:
$3,999 + $4,161 = $8,150

Finally, to find out how much money the store made from selling t-shirts overall, we need to subtract the cost of the t-shirts themselves from the total amount of money made:
$8,150 - $87 x 95 = $302

So, the store made $302 from selling t-shirts during both games."
"Response: 137
Explanation:
According to the question, during the Arkansas game, they sold 115 T-shirts, and during the Texas Tech game, they sold 137 T-shirts. Therefore, the answer is 137."
Response: 450$ 
Response:  $140$
"Response:  $183 \times 62 = 11,496$
Explanation: The profit from selling T-shirts is calculated by multiplying the number of T-shirts sold (183) by the price per T-shirt ($62)."
"Response:  $1290$
Explanation:
From the question, we know that each T-shirt brings in $67$, and each jersey brings in $165$. Therefore, the total revenue from selling T-shirts is:
$$74 \times 67 = 4830$$
And the total revenue from selling jerseys is:
$$156 \times 165 = 25940$$
Adding both of these amounts gives us the total revenue:
$$4830 + 25940 = 30770$$
Therefore, the Arkansas Razorbacks made $30770$ from selling their merchandise at the Texas A&M game."
"Response:  $68$
Explanation:
Let's say the price of one T-shirt is x dollars. Since they sold 157 T-shirts and each T-shirt costs $x$, the total revenue from T-shirts is 157x dollars. Similarly, since they sold 19 T-shirts and each T-shirt costs $x$, the total revenue from T-shirts is 19x dollars. Therefore, the difference between the total revenue from T-shirts and ball caps is:
Total revenue from T-shirts - Total revenue from ball caps = 157x - 19x = 138x dollars.
So, one T-shirt costs $138/157 = 89$ dollars more than one ball cap."
"Response:  $170$
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, each T-shirt costs $86$, and each jersey costs $232$. Therefore, we can calculate the price of one jersey by subtracting the cost of one T-shirt from its price:
$$\text{Price of one jersey} = \text{Price of one T-shirt} - \text{Cost of one T-shirt}$$
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
$$\text{Price of one jersey} = 232 - 86 = 146$$
Therefore, one jersey costs $146$ more than one T-shirt."
"Response: 427 dollars
Explanation:
The total number of T-shirts sold = 130
Selling price per T-shirt = $51
Discount per T-shirt during Arkansas and Texas Tech game period = $8
Total revenue from selling T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Selling price per T-shirt - Discount per T-shirt
= 130 x $51 - ($8 x 130)
= $6,630 - $1,040
= $5,590
Therefore, they earned $5,590 from selling T-shirts."
"Response: 3580 USD
Explanation:
The total number of T-shirts sold = 14
Each T-shirt was originally priced at $201
After the price increase, each T-shirt was priced at $217 (original price + 217%)
Total revenue from T-shirt sales = Number of T-shirts x Original price per T-shirt + Price increase percentage x Total number of T-shirts
= 14 x $201 + ($217 - $201) x 14
= $3580
Therefore, the pig's profit from selling T-shirts is $3580."
"Response: 60 / 10 = 6
Therefore, they sold 6 T-shirts during the competition period."
"Response:  $215 / 5 = $43
Explanation: According to the question, T-shirt store earned $215 by selling 5 T-shirts during the competition in Arkansas and Texas Tech University. Since each T-shirt costs $43, we can conclude that this is the price of each T-shirt."
"Response:  $215 \times 20 =$ 4300 
Explanation:  Since each T-shirt sells for $215 and they sold 20 T-shirts, they earned $4300 from T-shirts."
"Response:  $396$
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, Razorback Merchandise sold 158 T-shirts and 2 jerseys at Arkansas and Texas Tech games. Since each T-shirt costs $204 and each jersey costs $76, the total revenue from these sales is:

Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey
= 158 x $204 + 2 x $76
= $396
Therefore, Razorback Merchandise earned $396 from selling T-shirts and jerseys at the Arkansas and Texas Tech games."
"Response: 53 dollars
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, each T-shirt costs $240 and each basketball jersey costs $210. Therefore, if they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 basketball jerseys, the total revenue from T-shirts would be:
177 x $240 = $43,860
The total revenue from basketball jerseys would be:
23 x $210 = $4930
So, the difference between the cost of T-shirts and basketball jerseys is:
$43,860 - $4930 = $43,430
Therefore, one T-shirt costs $43,430 / 177 = $240."
"Response:  $115 - $25 = $90 
Explanation: According to the question, each T-shirt costs $25 and each jersey costs $115. In total, they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 jerseys, so the difference between the cost of the jerseys and T-shirts is $115 - $25 = $90."

Explanation: According to the question, 刘易斯 (Liu Yi) earned $1216 during the harvest season. If he earns $16 per week, then the number of weeks during which he worked can be calculated as follows:
$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks
Therefore, 刘易斯 worked for 78 weeks during the harvest season."
"Response: 4539.82
Explanation:
Let's break down the calculation:
Weekly income = $21/week x 216 weeks = $4,480
Tax amount = $702
Total earnings after taxes = $4,480 - $702 = $3,778
So at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $3,778 left."
"Response: 409685
Explanation:
If Lewis earns $1357 per week during an income season of 223 weeks, he will have earned a total of:
$1357 x 223 = $293,513
If he worked for 73 income seasons, his total earnings would be:
$293,513 x 73 = $409685
Therefore, if Lewis works for 73 income seasons, he will have earned a total of $409685."
"Response: 4576
Explanation:
Louis earns $28 per week during harvest season and works overtime to earn an additional $939 per week. If he works every week during harvest season, his total earnings for that period would be:
$28 x 1091 weeks = $297,980
Adding his overtime earnings of $939 per week gives him a total of:
$297,980 + ($939 x 1091 weeks) = $4576
Therefore, Louis's total earnings during harvest season are $4576."
Response: 567 dollars.
"Response: 4027.67 USD
Explanation:
Louis earns $368 per week during the harvest season, and he pays $388 in rent every week. Since the harvest season lasts for 1359 weeks, Louis pays a total of $4027.67 in rent during that time period."
"Response: 5307
Explanation:
Louis earns $491 per week and pays $216 in rent every week. To calculate how much money Louis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract the amount he spends on rent from his total earnings.
Total earnings = $491 x 1181 weeks = $580,391
Rent paid = $216 x 1181 weeks = $249,616
Net income = Total earnings - Rent paid = $580,391 - $249,616 = $330,775
Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Louis will have $330,775 left after paying his rent."
Response:  $133 / 19 = $7.00 per week$

Explanation: According to the question, Louis earned $2 per week during the harvest season. Therefore, he earned a total of $178 / $2 = 9 x $2 = 9 weeks."
"Response: 36 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, if water's depth is 10 times Devin's height, and Devin's height is 9 feet, then the depth of the water would be 9 x 10 = 90 feet. Since Devin's height is 9 feet, the difference between his height and the depth of the water would be 9 - 90 = -81 feet. Therefore, the water is deeper than Devin by 81 feet."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, the depth of the water is twice Devin's height, which means it is 2 times 7 = 14 feet deep. Since Devin is 8 feet tall, and he stands at a height of 14 feet above the water level, the water must be 14 - 8 = 6 feet deep."
"Response: 30 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, the water's depth is 5 times Roan's height, which means it is 5 x 7 = 35 feet deep. Since Dane is 11 feet shorter than Roan, the water's depth at that point would be 35 - 11 = 24 feet. Finally, if Roan stands at 12 feet high, the water's depth would be 24 + 12 = 36 feet."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, the depth of the water is 15 times Devin's height, which means it is 15 x 7 = 105 feet deep. Since Devin is 4 feet taller than Ron, and Ron is standing at 13 feet, the water is 13 + 4 = 17 feet deeper than where Ron is standing. Therefore, the water is 105 - 17 = 88 feet deep."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, the water's depth is 16 times Ron's height, which means it is 16 x 7 = 112 feet deep. Since Devin is 9 feet taller than Ron, the water is now 112 + 9 = 121 feet deep."
"Response: 40 feet
Explanation:
According to the question, the depth of the water is equal to Devin's height times 9. Since Devin's height is 5 feet (which is equivalent to 60 inches), and he is 9 times taller than Ryan, the depth of the water is:

Depth = 5 ft x 9 = 45 ft

Since Ryan's height is 15 feet, which is equivalent to 180 inches, we can convert it to feet by dividing by 12:

Feet = 180 in / 12 = 15 ft

Therefore, the depth of the water is 45 + 15 = 60 feet."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel of Tianzhang Park. If 20 people can ride at the same time, and each seat can accommodate multiple people, then we need to divide 20 by 4 to get the number of people that can sit on each seat. Therefore, each seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5)."
"Response: 56 seats
Explanation: According to the question, each seat can accommodate 9 people, so there are 9 x 5 = 45 seats in total. Since the wheel can simultaneously carry 18 people, there must be an additional 18 - 45 = 56 seats."
"Response: 38 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at once.
Explanation:
Each Ferris wheel has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat, so there are 19 x 15 = 285 possible riders in total. However, since each person can only ride on one Ferris wheel, we need to divide this number by 20 to get the maximum number of people who can ride on all 20 Ferris wheels simultaneously: 285 / 20 = 14.25 people. Since you cannot have a fraction of a rider, the final answer is rounded up to 38 people."
"Response: 42 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once.
Explanation:
According to the question, each seat in the Ferris wheel can accommodate 15 people. Since there are 18 seats in total, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 18 x 15 = 270 people. However, since 10 seats are broken, we need to subtract 10 from the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel, which gives us 260 people. Therefore, 42 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once."
"Response: 20 people can join the Ferris wheel.
Explanation: According to the question, each seat in the Ferris wheel can accommodate 14 people, and there are 6 seats in total. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Since there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, we can add up to 84 - 16 = 68 more people."

Response: 40 pieces of pizza (per person)
Response: 45 x 10 = 450 seeds
Response: 120 seeds.
"Response: 4 flower beds
Explanation: According to the question, they planted 36 seeds in total and each flower bed has 12 seeds. Therefore, there are 36 / 12 = 3 flower beds. However, since only 58 seeds grew into flowers, there must be an additional flower bed with 58 - 3 = 55 seeds that did not grow into flowers. So, the final answer is 4 flower beds."
"Response: 37 flowers
Explanation:
Let's assume that they planted x number of seeds in total. Since each flowerbed has 15 seeds and can only hold 60 flowers, we know that x = 60x/15. Solving for x, we get x = 37. Therefore, they planted 37 flowers in total."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Patchi and his mother planted 10 seeds in each of 6 flower beds. Therefore, they planted a total of 60 seeds (10 x 6 = 60). So, there are 6 flower beds."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, 佩奇 is helping his mother plant flowers in 8 flower beds. They have planted a total of 32 seeds. If they are planting the same number of seeds in each flower bed, then the number of seeds planted in each flower bed is 32 / 8 = 4."
"Response: 56
Explanation: If Ma Su has 11 friends and gives each of them 2 pieces of bread, he will have given out 2 x 11 = 22 pieces of bread in total. Since he still has some bread left over, there must be 22 - 56 = -34 pieces of bread left over. However, since negative numbers are not allowed in this competition, we can simply round down to 0 pieces of bread left over."
Response: 4 friends (or 4 blocks of bread)
"Response: 3 buns per friend.
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Ma Tian has 15 buns and wants to share them equally among his 5 friends. Since there are 5 friends in total, each friend will get an equal number of buns, which is 3 buns per friend. Therefore, the answer is 3 buns per friend."
Response: 9 buns (b)
Response: 56 (bread) or 7 (cake)
Response: 15 pieces of cake and 24 pieces of bread.
Response: 35 (bread) and 35 (cake).
"Response: 36 / 18 = 2
Explanation: Since Ma Su gave each of his 18 friends an equal number of cookies, and he had 36 cookies in total, each friend got 2 cookies (36 / 18)."
Response: 5 friends (or 5/3 = 1.67)
Response:  Each of his two friends got 11/3 = 3.67 pieces of bread (since he had 23 pieces and gave away an equal number). So each friend got 3.67 pieces of bread.
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the question, Ma Su has 31 pieces of bread and gives an equal number (31) to each of his 5 friends. After giving them away, he still has 23 pieces of bread left. Therefore, the answer is 31."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Ma gave each of his four friends an equal number of cookies and cakes. If he initially had 32 blocks of cookies and 98 blocks of cake, then each friend got 32/4 = 8 blocks of cookies and 98/4 = 24 blocks of cake."
"Response: 3
Explanation:
According to the problem statement, Ma Su gave each of his four friends an equal number of cookies and cakes. If he initially had 10 blocks of cookies and 8 pieces of cake, then he must have given each friend 2.5 cookies (10 / 4) and 3 pieces of cake (8 / 4). Therefore, each person ate 3 pieces of cake."
"Response:  Each of his friends got 28/29 = 0.967 (or approximately 1) pieces of cake and cookies.
Explanation:
Let's assume that Ma has x pieces of cake and y pieces of cookies initially. Since he gave each friend an equal number of both, we can write the equation:
x + y = 28 (since there are 28 total pieces)
x / 2 = y / 2 ( since each person got half as many pieces as the other)
Now solve for x and y:
x = 13 + 15 = 28
y = x / 2 = (13 + 15) / 2 = 14
So Ma had 13 pieces of cake and 14 pieces of cookies initially. And each of his friends got approximately 1 piece of cake and 1.4 pieces of cookies."
"Response: 568 water bottles.
Explanation:
Let's assume that Debi buys x water bottles initially. Since she drinks 109 bottles per day, and the supply lasts for 74 days, the total number of bottles she consumes is:
x × 109 = 74 × 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 568
Therefore, Debi bought 568 water bottles initially."
"Response: 960
Explanation:
Let's assume that Debi buys x water bottles initially. Since she drinks the same number of bottles every day, we can write an equation based on this information:
Debi drank x/2 water bottles per day for 17 days = 960 water bottles (since there are 17 x 2 = 34 days in total)
Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem statement into the above equation:
x/2 = 960
Solving for x, we get:
x = 180
So, Debi bought 180 water bottles initially and drank 960 bottles over the course of 17 days."
"Response: 309
Explanation:
Let's assume that Dibi bought 264 bottles of water. If she drinks 15 bottles per day, then she will finish 15 x 11 = 165 bottles in total. So, there are 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left with her after 11 days."
"Response: 6 days
Explanation:
According to the question, 黛比 bought 301 bottles of water and drank 144 bottles per day. Therefore, she had 157 bottles left after drinking for 6 days."
"Response: 20 days
Explanation:
Let's assume that Debi buys 88 water bottles and 13 sugar-water bottles. If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 sugar-water bottles per day, then the total number of bottles she will consume in one day is:

Water bottles = 4 x 88 = 352
Sugar-water bottles = 87

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take for her to finish all the bottles:

Total bottles = Water bottles + Sugar-water bottles = 352 + 87 = 439

Since Debi consumes 4 bottles per day, it will take her approximately 109 days (439 / 4 = 109) to finish all the bottles. However, since we are asked for the maximum duration, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 20 days. Therefore, the answer is 20 days."
"Response: 37 days
Explanation:
Let's first calculate how many water bottles and soda water bottles Debi has in total:
Water bottles = 200 x 312 = 62,400
Soda water bottles = 256 x 4 = 1,024
Now, let's find out how long it will take for Debi to finish all of them:
Total number of bottles = Water bottles + Soda water bottles = 62,400 + 1,024 = 63,424
Debi drinks 312 water bottles and 4 soda water bottles every day, so she will finish all of them in:
Days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles per day = 63,424 / (312 + 4) = 37 days
Therefore, if Debi continues to drink at this rate, she will be able to keep her stock of water bottles and soda water bottles for approximately 37 days."
"Response: 2 days
Explanation: If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and has bought 12 bottles in total, then she can use the water for 2 days (12 / 6 = 2)."
"Response: 30 days
Explanation:
According to the information provided in the question, Debi bought 180 bottles of mineral water and 95 bottles of soda water. If she drinks 15 bottles of mineral water and 54 bottles of soda water per day, then the number of days she can continue consuming these waters is calculated as follows:

Number of bottles of mineral water = 180 / 15 = 12 days
Number of bottles of soda water = 95 / 54 = 1.76 days (since 1.76 days is greater than 1 day, round up to 2 days)
Therefore, Debi can continue consuming the mineral water for 12 days and the soda water for 2 days."
"Response: 45 days
Explanation:
Let's first calculate how many bottles of water Debi has bought in total:
360 + 162 = 522 bottles
Now, let's find out how many bottles she can drink per day:
122 bottles/day x 30 days = 3660 bottles
Since Debi has enough water to last for 522 bottles, and she can drink 3660 bottles in 30 days, we can conclude that the remaining water will last for:
522 - 3660 = -3138 bottles
So, the remaining water will last for 45 days (since there are 30 days in a month)."
"Response: 14 x 11 = 154
Therefore, she has 154 pencils."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 12 pencils and they are divided into 3 rows of 4 pencils each, then each row has 4 pencils."
"Response: 13 rows
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Pai has 28 packets of pencils, and each packet contains 24 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils she has is:
28 packets x 24 pencils/packet = 672 pencils
Since each row requires 16 pencils, Pai can make at most 672 / 16 = 42 rows."
"Response: 308
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are 22 pens in each row and 6 rows in total. Therefore, the total number of pens is:
22 x 6 = 126
Since there are 6 boxes of pens, the total number of pens in all boxes is:
126 x 6 = 756
However, the question states that she has 6 boxes of pens, which means she has 756 / 6 = 126 boxes of pens.
So, the final answer is 126 + 126 = 252 pens."
"Response: 14 lines
Explanation:
According to the question, Pai has 35 steel pens and 7 ink pens. Each line requires 5 steel pens, so she can write 35 / 5 = 7 lines with steel pens. Since each line also requires 1 ink pen, she can write an additional 7 lines using ink pens. Therefore, the total number of lines that Pai can write is 7 + 7 = 14 lines."
"Response: 56
Explanation: According to the question, there are 19 rows in total, and each row has 4 steel pens and 27 wooden pens. Therefore, the total number of steel pens is 19 x 4 = 76, and the total number of wooden pens is 19 x 27 = 560. So, the answer is 56."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, there are 7 rows in total, and each row has 36 steel pens and 30 charcoal pens. Therefore, the total number of charcoal pens is 30 x 7 = 210."
Response: 450 (11 x 31 + 27)
"Response: 60 rows
Explanation:
Since there are 30 pens and each row has 5 pens, the total number of rows that can be made is 30 x 5 = 150. However, since some rows may have fewer than 5 pens (e.g., if there are only 29 pens left after drawing one line), we cannot make more than 60 complete rows. Therefore, the correct answer is 60 rows."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, 菲放了一些铅笔平均分成2行，which means that she divided the pens equally into two rows. If she has 6 pens in total and each row contains an equal number of pens, then there must be 3 pens in each row. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response: 14 rows
Explanation:
Since there are 35 packages of pencils and each package contains 4 pencils, the total number of pencils is 35 x 4 = 140. Since she can put 2 pencils in each row, she can make 14 rows."
"Response: 57
Explanation:
From the question, we know that there are 31 packages of pencils and each package contains 6 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils is:
31 x 6 = 186
However, the question states that she put 19 pencils in each row, so the number of rows is:
186 / 19 = 9
Therefore, the number of pencils is:
9 x 19 = 171
So, the answer is 171."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the problem statement, if she divides her pencils into 30 rows and each row has 71 wooden pencils and 24 metal pencils, then she will have 24 metal pencils in total."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, there are 16 rows in total, and each row has 6 pencils of type A (蜡笔) and 21 pencils of type B (铅笔). Therefore, the total number of pencils of type A is 6 x 16 = 96, and the total number of pencils of type B is 21 x 16 = 324. Since we know that the total number of pencils is 580, we can deduce that there must be 10 pencils of type A for every 32 pencils of type B."
"Response: 360 seats
Explanation:
The number of students in the school is given as 98. If all 7 school buses are fully occupied, each bus can seat how many students?
Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of school buses
= 98 / 7
= 14
So, there are 14 students per bus. Since there are 7 school buses, the total number of seats available for students is:
Seats per bus x Number of school buses
= 14 x 7
= 98
Therefore, there are 360 seats (98 x 4) available for students during the field trip."
"Response: 360 students
Explanation:
The number of classrooms is given as 84. Each classroom has 20-30 students (as mentioned in the passage). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:
84 x 20 = 1680 students
However, since all seats in the buses are occupied, we know that there are at least 95 x 118 = 11,170 students in the school. Since this is greater than the maximum possible number of students (1680), we can conclude that there must be more than 1680 students in the school. The exact number is 360 more than 1680, which is 1680 + 360 = 2040 students."
"Response: 10 school buses are needed for this field trip.
Explanation:
The total number of students in all 67 classrooms is 66 x 67 = 4232. Since each school bus can seat 6 people, we need:
4232 / 6 = 705 seats
Therefore, 10 school buses with 705 seats each will be required to transport all the students for this field trip."
"Response: 46 school buses are needed for this field trip.
Explanation:
Let's assume that each class has an equal number of students (58/class). Since there are 87 classes in total, the total number of students is 87 x 58 = 4934.
Since each student needs to be transported by two school buses, we need twice as many buses as the number of students. Therefore, the required number of school buses is 4934 / 2 = 2467 buses.
However, since each bus can seat 2 students, we divide the total number of students by 2 to get the number of buses needed: 4934 / 2 = 2467 buses."
Response: 30 students per class
"Response: 3 school buses are needed for the field trip.
Explanation:
Total number of students = 102
Number of students who do not want to participate in the field trip = 22
Number of seats available per school bus = 8
Therefore, total number of school buses required = Total number of students - Number of students who do not want to participate / Number of seats available per school bus
= 102 - 22 / 8
= 3
So, 3 school buses are needed for the field trip."
"Response: 93 students will participate in the field trip.
Explanation:
The total number of classes is 102, and each class has 30 students (based on the assumption that there are 30 students per class). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 102 x 30 = 3060 students.
If 8 students do not want to participate in the field trip, then the number of students who will participate is 3060 - 8 = 3052 students.
Since each bus can seat 99 students, the number of buses needed for the field trip is 3052 / 99 = 31 buses."
Response: 40 school buses are needed for this field trip.
"Response: 350 seats
Explanation:
The number of classes is given as 17. Let's assume each class has an average of 30 students (this may vary depending on the school and curriculum). Therefore, the total number of students in all classes is:
17 x 30 = 510 students
Since there are 92 students in total, we can deduce that some classes have fewer than 30 students. However, for simplicity, let's assume every class has exactly 30 students.
Now, let's calculate the number of seat per school bus:
If all 46 school buses are full (which means they have no empty seats), then the total number of seats available on these buses is:
46 x 50 = 2300 seats
However, since there are only 92 students in total, we know that not all students will fit on the school buses. So, to find out how many students can fit on each bus, we divide the total number of seats by the number of students:
2300 seats / 92 students = approximately 25 seats per bus
Therefore, if all school buses are fully occupied, each bus can accommodate around 25 students."

"Response: 1048 pages
Explanation:
The book has taken Frank 569 days to read, which means he reads at a rate of 22 pages per day. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is:
Number of pages = Total pages / Number of days taken to read them
= 1048 pages (assuming the book has 1048 pages)
Therefore, the answer is 1048 pages."
Response: 25 pages/day
"Response: 147 pages per chapter
Explanation:
According to the question, Frank read a book with 555 pages in total and it took him 220 days to finish reading it. Since there are 5 chapters in the book, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows:
Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 555 pages / 5 chapters
= 111 pages per chapter
However, since Frank spent 220 days reading the book, he must have read an average of 147 pages per day (111 pages/chapter x 220 days). Therefore, the answer is 147 pages per chapter."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the passage, Frank read 15 chapters in total and it took him 660 days to finish reading the book. Since there are 15 chapter, he reads one chapter per day. Therefore, his daily reading speed is 15/660 = 0.023 chapter per day."

"Response: 30 books
Explanation: According to the question, Frank spent 12 days reading each book, which means he read 66 pages per day. Therefore, he read 66 x 12 = 792 pages in total. Since he spent 492 days reading all the books, he must have read 792 / 492 = 30 books."
Response: 7 pages per day (16 days / 112 pages = 7 pages/day)
"Response: 8 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank reads 8 pages per day, and the book has 576 pages. To find out how many days it will take him to read the entire book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 576 pages / 8 pages/day = 72 days. Since there are 8 days in a week, we can round up to 8 days."
"Response: 120 pages/day
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 41 chapters of his favorite book, and each chapter has 450 pages. Therefore, he spent 30 days reading the book, which means he read 30 x 450 = 13,500 pages in total. Since he spent 30 days reading the book, he averaged 13,500 / 30 = 450 pages per day."
"Response: 182 pages per chapter
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read the book for 607 days, and each chapter has 594 pages. Therefore, there are 607 / 594 = 1.02 chapters in the book. Since each chapter has 594 pages, there are 1.02 x 594 = 616 pages in the entire book."

"Response: 10 groups.
Explanation: According to the question, Philip's collection of bananas is divided into 18 sets of 18 bananas each. Therefore, there are 18 x 18 = 324 bananas in total. Since there are only 180 bananas in Philip's collection, it means that his collection has been divided into 10 groups of 32 bananas each."
"Response: 
There are 290 strawberries and 87 oranges in Philip's collection. If the strawberries are divided into 2 groups, each group will have how many strawberries?
Let's assume that the number of groups is x. Then, the total number of strawberries in all groups is 2x. Since there are 87 oranges, we can calculate the number of oranges per group by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of groups: x/groups = 87/2 = 43.5 groups. Therefore, each group has 43.5 oranges."
"Response: 
The number of oranges in each group of bananas is 16/345 = 0.047.
Therefore, there are 0.047 x 192 = 8.76 oranges in each group of bananas."

Explanation:
According to the passage, there were 317 visitors to the White Gold Hall on the day after they finished their meal, and 295 visitors the previous day. To find out how many more visitors there were on the second day, we can subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day:

317 - 295 = 22
Therefore, there were 22 more visitors on the second day than on the first day."
"Response: 1897
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* After finishing a sumptuous meal, they went to visit Buckingham Palace.
* The previous day, there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace.
* If there were 246 visitors the day before, then there will be x number of visitors in total over 25 days.

* ""前一天有多少游客参观了白金汉宊?"" means that how many tourists visited Buckingham Palace the previous day?

Now, let's calculate the number of tourists who visited Buckingham Palace the previous day:

Total number of tourists = 406 - 132 + 1 (the previous day)
= 273

Therefore, the answer is 58."
"Response: 106
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""吃完一顿丰盛的饭后"" means that after eating a meal, they went to visit the palace.
* ""他们去参观了白金汉宫"" means that they visited the White Gold Hall Palace.
* ""在那里，瑞秋得知前一天有45名游客来到了白金汉宫"" means that at the palace, Rachel learned that 45 tourists came the day before.
* ""如果在过去的85天里有829人参观了白金汉宫，那么那一天有多少游客参观了白金汉宫？"" means that if there were 829 people who visited the palace in the past 85 days, then how many tourists visited the palace on that particular day?

Now, let's calculate the number of tourists who visited the palace on that day:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors in 85 days + Number of tourists who came the day before (according to Rachel)
= 829 + 45
= 874

Therefore, the answer is 106."
"Response: 3690
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* After finishing a sumptuous meal, they visited Buckingham Palace.
* Inside Buckingham Palace, there are 71 paintings.
* On the day of their visit, 557 people came to see the palace.
* The previous day, 188 people visited the palace.

Now, let's calculate the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace during the 57-day period:

Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2: 557 visitors (including the ones from Day 1) + 188 = 745 visitors
Day 3: 745 visitors (including the ones from Day 2) + 188 = 933 visitors
...
Day 57: 933 visitors (including the ones from Day 56) + 188 = 1121 visitors

Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace during the 57-day period is 1121."
"Response: 66 - 600 = 661
Explanation: The number of visitors today (661) is greater than the number of visitors yesterday (600), so there are 61 more visitors today compared to yesterday."
"Response: 586
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* On the day of the visit (Day X), there were 92 visitors to the palace.
* The previous day (Day Y), there were 419 visitors to the palace.
* The day before that (Day Z), there were 103 visitors to the palace.

We can create a pattern based on these numbers:

Day X: 92 visitors
Day Y: 419 visitors - 103 visitors = 316 visitors
Day Z: 103 visitors

So, the total number of visitors to the palace over the three days is:
316 + 419 + 103 = 586 visitors
Therefore, the answer is 586."
"Response: 3632
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* On the day after they finished their meal, there were 512 visitors to the White Gold Palace.
* The previous day, there were 471 visitors.
* Two days ago, there were 808 visitors.

We can use these numbers to find out how many people visited the palace over an 89-day period:

Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 808 visitors (additional 337 visitors)
Day 3: 512 visitors (additional 214 visitors)
Total number of visitors = 471 + 337 + 214 = 1022 visitors

Therefore, over an 89-day period, 3632 people visited the White Gold Palace (1022 visitors x 89 days)."
"Response: 318
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Previous day (day - 1): 191 visitors
* Day before that (day - 2): 457 visitors
* Current day (day): 705 visitors

So, the increase in number of visitors from one day to the next is:
705 - 191 = 514

Now, let's find out how many days have passed since the last time there were 457 visitors:
514 - 457 = 67

Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the number of visitors on the day when there were 457 visitors is:
705 - 457 = 318

So, the answer is 318."
"Response: 379 grams (or 12.4 oz)
Explanation:
According to the question, he already has 159 grams of wax (which is equivalent to 0.159 kg or 12.4 oz). If the total amount of wax needed for feathers is 628 grams, then he still needs 469 grams (or 0.469 kg or 16.1 oz) more wax."
"Response: 136
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* The total amount of color needed is 49 grams.
* The amount of wax required for each feather is 288 grams.
* The current amount of wax available is 260 grams.

Now, let's find out how many feathers can be colored with the available wax:

Number of feathers = Total amount of color / Amount of wax per feather
= 49 g / 288 g
= 0.175 feathers (or 17.5%)

So, the person has already colored 17.5% of the total number of feathers. To find out how much wax is left, we need to subtract the amount used from the total amount available:

Amount of wax left = Total amount of wax - Amount used
= 260 g - 17.5% x 288 g
= 260 g - 49 g
= 211 g

Therefore, the person has 211 grams of wax left."
"Response: 140
Explanation: According to the question, the total amount of wax needed for feathers is 353 grams, and the person already has 22 grams of wax. Therefore, the remaining amount of wax needed is 353 - 22 = 331 grams."
Response: 146 grams (166 - 20 = 146)
"Response: 386ck
Explanation:
According to the problem statement, the person currently needs 17 grams of wax (not kilograms). To find out how much wax he needed initially, we need to subtract the amount he currently needs from the total amount he had. So, if he had 557 grams of wax and now he needs 17 grams, then he initially had 540 grams of wax (557 - 17 = 540)."
"Response: 375 grams
Explanation:
According to the problem statement, the person currently has 11 grams of wax, and the feathers require a total of 492 grams of wax. To find out how much more wax the person needs, we can subtract the amount they already have from the total amount required:

492 grams - 11 grams = 481 grams
Therefore, the person needs an additional 481 grams of wax."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, the farmer was informed by 94 pickers that they had collected 90 baskets of grapes in 6 days. This means that each day, the pickers collected an average of 15 baskets (90/6 = 15)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, the workers harvested 266 grapes in 5 days, which means they harvested an average of 53 grapes per day. Since there are 90 grape containers filled every day, we can deduce that each container holds an average of 1.74 grapes (90/53)."
"Response: 3058
Explanation:
The farmer is told that he will have 294 workers harvesting grapes for him every day. Each worker can fill 244 grape barrels and 47 flower pots per day. Since there are 146 days in total, the number of grape barrels filled would be:
294 x 244 = 69,596 grape barrels
Additionally, since each worker can also fill 47 flower pots per day, the total number of flower pots filled would be:
69,596 x 47 = 3058 flower pots
Therefore, the total number of grape barrels and flower pots filled during the entire period is 69,596 + 3058 = 72,654."
"Response: 4986.5 drums (or 176,320 bushels)
Explanation:
The farmer is told that he will have to harvest 235 workers every day and each worker can fill 100 barrels or 221 bushels per day. Since there are 77 days in total, the number of barrels or bushels that will be filled is calculated as follows:
Barrels/day = Number of workers x Barrels/worker
= 235 x 100
= 23,500 barrels/day
Total barrels = Total number of days x Barrels/day
= 77 x 23,500
= 1,892,500 barrels
Since one barrel contains 42 gallons, we can convert the total number of barrels to bushels by multiplying it by 42:
Bushels = Total barrels x Gallons/barrel
= 1,892,500 x 42
= 83,630,000 bushels
Therefore, the farmer will have to harvest approximately 83,630,000 bushels of grapes over the course of 77 days."
"Response: 58 x 108 = 6344

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are 14 bags of snacks, and each bag contains an equal number of crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers is 14 x 28 = 372. Since there are also 86 pieces of candy, the total number of bags must be less than or equal to 372 / 86 = 4. So, there are 3 bags of snacks in total."
"Response: 40
Explanation:
According to the question, an mailman must send 5 pieces of trash mail to each street area. If he sends 25 pieces of mail to every house in each street area, then there are 5 houses per street area x 25 pieces of mail = 125 pieces of mail total for each street area. Therefore, if there are n street areas, then the total number of houses is 125n. Since each street area has 5 houses, we can set up the equation 125n = 5x, where x is the number of street areas. Solving for n gives us n = 40."
"Response: 180 letters
Explanation:
The total number of street areas is given as 20, and each street area has 9 houses. Therefore, the total number of houses is 20 x 9 = 180. Since the postman needs to send one trash letter to each house, he will need to send 180 trash letters in total."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Since there are 6 houses in the street, and each mailman needs to deliver 24 pieces of trash mail to each house, the total number of pieces of trash mail that need to be delivered is 6 x 24 = 144. Therefore, each mailman will have to deliver 144 / 6 = 24 pieces of trash mail per house."
"Response: 7 households
Explanation:
According to the question, the mailman delivers 14 pieces of trash mail to each household in a street area. If he sends 2 pieces of trash mail to each of the 7 street areas, then there are 7 x 7 = 49 households in total. However, since each household receives 14 pieces of trash mail, the number of households is actually 49 / 14 = 3.5 households per street area. Since there are 7 street areas, the total number of households is 7 x 3.5 = 24.5 households. Therefore, there are 24.5 households in the area."
"Response: 640
Explanation:
Each street has 20 houses, and each house receives 32 pieces of trash mail. Therefore, the total number of pieces of trash mail delivered to each street is 32 x 20 = 640."
Response: 56 letters (rounded to nearest integer)
"Response: 160
Explanation:
According to the question, the postman must deliver 8 letters to each of the 55 street areas. Therefore, the total number of letters he needs to deliver is 55 x 8 = 440 letters.
If he delivers 32 letters to each of the 160 houses in one street area (which is the maximum number of houses in a street area), then there are 160 houses in that street area."
"Response: 32
Explanation:
Since there are 81 total houses to deliver mail to and each street has 12 houses, the delivery person needs to deliver mail to every house in each of the 7 streets. Therefore, the number of letters delivered to each street is 7 x 12 = 84 letters. Since there are 81 total letters, the remaining 9 letters will be delivered to the extra houses that do not fit into any of the 7 streets (i.e., the leftover letters)."
"Response: 68
Explanation:
To determine how many mail pieces the postman needs to deliver, we need to calculate the total number of houses in all 16 street districts and multiply it by 4 (the number of mail pieces per house). Since each street district has 17 houses, the total number of houses is:
16 x 17 = 252
So, the postman needs to deliver 252 x 4 = 1008 mail pieces."

Response: 2 groups of 3 eggs and 1 group of 5 eggs.
Response: 5 eggs per group
Response: 30 groups
"Response: 10
Explanation: To create groups of 3 eggs, we need to divide them among 3 sets of objects. Since there are 99 eggs and each set contains 3 objects (eggs), we can make 33 sets of eggs. Similarly, since there are 9 eggs and 27 beads, we can make 3 sets of eggs and 27 sets of beads. Therefore, the total number of groups is 3 x 33 = 10."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Rebecca has 20 chicken eggs and 6 marbles. To divide the chicken eggs into groups of 5 each, she will have 4 groups (20 / 5 = 4). Since she has more marbles than chicken eggs, there are 3 extra marbles left over after dividing the chicken eggs into groups. Therefore, the difference between the number of chicken eggs and marbles is 3."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs. If she wants to divide the eggs into groups of 20 each, she will have 5 groups of 20 eggs each (since 12 / 5 = 2). Therefore, Rebecca has 3 more eggs than marbles (5 marbles vs 8 eggs)."

"Response: 24
Explanation:
If Emily has 72 friends and each friend needs 3 beads for an item chain, then Emily will need to make 72 x 3 = 216 item chains. Since she only has 6 beads, she can only make 216 / 6 = 36 item chains. Therefore, the answer is 36."
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Amelia has 5 pearls and can make 20 chains. Since each chain requires multiple pearls, we need to divide the number of pearls by the number of chains to find out how many pearls each chain requires. Therefore, the answer is 10 pearls per chain."
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, Emily has already made 26 chains with 2 beads each, so she has used 52 beads (2 x 26). Since there are 44 friends in total, and each friend will receive one chain, Emily needs to make additional 9 chains (44 - 26 = 18) to complete all the orders. Therefore, Emily has a total of 50 beads left after making all the chains (52 - 9 = 43)."

"Response: 25 (or 26)
Explanation:
John needs 13 x 17 = 229 drill holes to fix the large wood planks for the wall.
In addition, he needs 8 x 8 = 64 drill holes to fix the smaller wood planks.
Therefore, John needs a total of 229 + 64 = 25 (or 26) drill holes to build the wall."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, John needs to use 11 nails to fix the wall panels of his house. If each panel requires 3 nails, then he will need 3 x 11 = 33 panels in total. Since there are 40 wooden planks in one panel, John will need 33 / 40 = 0.825 or approximately 40 panels to build the entire wall."
Response: 35 (12 big wood planks x 15 nails for each big wood plank + 10 small wood planks x 5 nails for each small wood plank)
Response: 32 (16 x 2)
"Response:  John needs 592 wooden planks to build the wall of his house.
Explanation: According to the question, each wooden plank requires 74 nails for fixation. Since John wants to use 8 wooden planks for the wall, he will need 8 x 74 = 592 nails in total. Therefore, John needs 592 wooden planks to build the wall of his house."
"Response: 30
Explanation:
John needs to use 12 big wood planks and 17 small wood planks for building the wall of his house. Each big wood plank requires 14 nails to fix it in place, so John needs 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the big wood planks. Similarly, each small wood plank requires 25 nails, so John needs 17 x 25 = 425 nails for all the small wood planks. In total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 nails to build the wall of his house. Therefore, he needs 30 wood planks (593 / 19 = 30) to build the wall of his house."

Response: 20 minutes
"Response: 20 pieces (5 minutes / 1 minute = 5 cycles; each cycle produces 4 shirts)"
"Response: 50 minutes
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
1. Yesterday, the machine produced 9 pieces of shirts per hour. (9 x 60 = 540)
2. Today, the machine produced 44 pieces of shirts per hour. (44 x 60 = 2740)
From the above two statements, we can conclude that the machine worked for twice as many hours today as it did yesterday.
So, if the machine worked for x hours yesterday, it will work for 2x hours today.
Substituting the values, we get:
X + 2X = 540 + 2740 = 3280
Solving for X, we get:
X = 50 minutes
Therefore, the machine worked for 50 minutes yesterday and 100 minutes today."
"Response: 45 minutes
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Yesterday, the machine produced 13 pieces of shirts. (Assuming it worked for x hours)
* Today, the machine produced 3 pieces of shirts. (Worked for x - 1 hours)
* The machine can produce 8 pieces of shirts per minute.

Now, let's find out how many hours the machine worked today:
Hours worked today = Total number of pieces produced / Minutes per piece
= 3 / 8
= 0.375 hours (or 22.5 minutes)

So, the machine worked for approximately 22.5 minutes today."
"Response: 45 minutes
Explanation:
The machine produced 9 pieces of shirts yesterday and 8 pieces today, so the total number of pieces produced is 9 + 8 = 17.
Since the machine can produce 2 pieces per minute, it worked for 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes today. Since you cannot have a fraction of a minute, round up to 9 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 45 minutes today."
"Response: 120 minutes
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The machine can produce 3 shirts per minute.
* Yesterday, it produced 4 shirts.
* Today, it produced 8 shirts.

So, we can calculate the total number of minutes worked by the machine as follows:
Total minutes = (Number of shirts produced yesterday x Number of shirts produced today) / 3
= (4 x 8) / 3
= 64 minutes

Therefore, the machine worked for 64 minutes."
"Response: 70 pieces of shirts (12 minutes/day x 14 pieces/day = 168 pieces/day; 168 pieces/day / 6 pieces/minute = 28 minutes)"

Explanation: According to the question, the daily earnings from playing the addiction game are $420 per day. Since they played for 30 days, their total earnings from this game alone is $420 x 30 = $12,600. Adding the other games' earnings of $22, we get a total of $12,600 + $22 = $12,622. Therefore, the daily earnings from playing the addiction game are $12,622 / 30 = $420 per day."

"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Rossi bought 10 packages of crackers and 4 packages of cakes. Therefore, she bought 10 + 4 = 14 packages of food in total. Since she bought more packages of crackers than cakes, the number of packages of crackers is greater than the number of packages of cakes by 10 - 4 = 6 packages."
Response: 38 packages (4 x 4 = 16 + 22 = 38)
"Response: 10 bags of cookies.
Explanation: According to the question, Rossi bought 23 packages of bread and some other miscellaneous items. If she also bought 10 bags of cookies (which is not specified in the question), then she has a total of 33 packages of food (23 + 10 = 33)."
"Response: 30 packages (or bags) of miscellaneous goods.
Explanation: According to the question, Rossi bought 2 packs of crackers and 12 packets of cakes. If each packet contains 4-5 items, then she bought a total of 80 items (2 x 4 = 8 + 12 x 5 = 60). Since she had $56 left after buying these items, and each item cost around $5, then she must have spent a total of $5 x 80 = $400 on miscellaneous goods. Therefore, she bought 400/56 = 7.14 packages or bags of miscellaneous goods. However, since you cannot buy a fraction of a package, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 30 packages."

The distance already traveled by the group is given as 849 feet. If they are traveling at a rate of 17 feet per hour, it will take them hours to reach the end of the cave. Therefore, the distance from their current location to the end of the cave can be calculated as follows:
End Distance = Total Distance - Distance Already Traveled
= 1218 feet - 849 feet
= 3056 feet
Therefore, the group has still got 3056 feet to go before reaching the end of the cave."

Therefore, Adam's shelves can hold up to 176 action figures."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
Adam has 10 action figures that he can place on each shelf in his room. However, his room can only accommodate 8 action figures, so there are 2 extra shelves that Adam cannot use. Therefore, the total number of shelves in Adam's room is 4."
