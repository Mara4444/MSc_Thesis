Response:  We know that Julie is 18 years old and has 10 pillows in her room.  So, we can say that each pillow represents one year of age for Julie. Therefore, if we want to find out how many pillows Somavar will have when he is as old as Julie, we need to subtract his current age from Julie's age.  Currently, Somavar is 5 years old, so he will have half of Julie's number of pillows or 5 pillows when he grows up to be as old as Julie.  Hence, the answer is 5 pillows.
Response:  We know that Julie is 11 years old and has 12 teeth. So, we can say that Julie has 1 tooth for every year of her age. Therefore, Julie has 11 teeth x 1 = 11 teeth in total. Now, let's consider Mangalavara who is also 12 years old but has only 10 teeth. So, we can say that Mangalavara has 1 tooth less than Julie for every year of his age. Therefore, Mangalavara has 10 teeth x 1 = 10 teeth in total. Hence, the difference between Julie's and Mangalavara's number of teeth is 1 (Julie has 1 extra tooth).
Response:  We know that Julie is 5 feet tall and Somavar is 6 feet tall. So, if we want to find out how many times taller Somavar is than Julie, we need to divide their heights.  Somavar is 6 feet tall, which means he is 72 inches tall (since there are 12 inches in a foot).  Julie is 5 feet tall, which means she is 60 inches tall (since there are 12 inches in a foot).  To find out how many times taller Somavar is than Julie, we can divide their heights: 72 / 60 = 1.2.  Therefore, Somavar is 1.2 times taller than Julie.
Response:  The given information is as follows:  Number of days in July = 30 Days in August = 31 Total number of days = 61 Now, we need to find out how many days are there between two dates. We know that the first date is July 1st and the second date is August 15th. So, we have to count from July 1st to August 15th. Therefore, the total number of days between these two dates is: 61 - 30 = 31 days.
Response:  The given expression is  $ \frac{16}{p} - \frac{12}{q} $. We need to find the value of $ p $ and $ q $ such that the expression becomes equal to zero.  So, we can write: $$ \frac{16}{p} - \frac{12}{q} = 0 $$ Now, let's solve for $ p $ and $ q $ separately: $$ \begin {aligned} p &= \frac{16}{x} \\ q &= \frac{12}{y} \end {aligned} $$ where $ x $ and $ y $ are the values that make the expression equal to zero.  Substituting the expressions into the above equations, we get: $$ \begin {aligned} p &= \frac{16}{x} = \frac{16}{0} = 16 \\ q &= \frac{12}{y} = \frac{12}{-4} = -3 \end {aligned} $$ Therefore, the values of $ p $ and $ q $ are $ 16 $ and $-3 $, respectively.
Response:  The distance between Jully and Mangalagiri is 14 miles. To cover this distance in 8 hours, we need to maintain an average speed of 1.75 miles per hour (MPH). Therefore, the time taken to travel from Jully to Mangalagiri is: Time = Distance / Speed = 14 miles / 1.75 MPH = 8 hours So, the correct answer is 8 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between July 17 and August 15.  There are 18 days between these two dates. Now we need to subtract the number of days that have already passed from the total number of days. So, the answer is:  Number of days left = Total days - Days elapsed = 18 - 2 = 16 days.
Response:  We know that Julie is 15 years old and will be 18 years old in 3 years. So, her age at that time will be 18 - 15 = 3 years. Now, we need to find out how many months are there between Julie's current age (15) and her future age (18). To do this, we can divide the difference of their ages by 12, since there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the number of months between Julie's current age and her future age is: 18 - 15 = 3 years x 12 = 36 months.
Response:  We know that Julie is 5 feet tall and Somavar is 9 feet tall. So, if we want to find out how many times taller Somavar is than Julie, we need to divide their height differences by each other's height.  That means:  Somavar is 9 - 5 = 4 times taller than Julie.
"Response:  We know that Julie has 2 pills left in her pill box labeled ""Soomavarana 2"" and she wants to take them at 10 AM.  So, we need to calculate how many hours are left before 10 AM from the current time.  As of now (based on the question), it is 8:30 AM. Therefore, there are 157 minutes left until 10 AM.  Now, let's convert this time into hours: 157 minutes / 60 = 2.617 hours. Since we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 hours. So, Julie has 3 hours left before she can take her next dose of Soomavarana 2."
Response:  We know that there are 9 pillars in each row and 7 rows in total. So, the number of pillars in one complete row is = 9 x 7 = 63 pillars. Now, we have to find out how many pillars are present between two adjacent columns. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pillars in one column from the number of pillars in the next column. For example, if we consider the first two columns, then the difference between the number of pillars in the first column and the second column is = 9 - 7 = 2 pillars. Similarly, for the third and fourth columns, the difference is = 8 - 5 = 3 pillars, and so on. Therefore, the total number of pillars between two adjacent columns is equal to the sum of these differences, which is given by = 2 + 3 +... + (n-1) = n(n-1)/2 pillars, where n is the number of columns. Since there are 9 columns in total, the number of pillars between any two adjacent columns is = 9(9-1)/2 = 108 pillars. Finally, since there are 7 rows in total, the number of pillars between any two adjacent rows is = 7(7-1)/2 = 49 pillars. Therefore, the answer to your question is 108 pillars between any two adjacent columns and 49 pillars between any two adjacent rows.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 14 appears in both the series and the pattern.  The series is given as follows: 14, 28, 42, 56,... (a sequence of numbers that increase by 14 each time)  Now, let's count the number of times the number 14 appears in this series: 14, 28, 42, 56,... (the number 14 appears once in every 3 positions) Therefore, there are 3 occurrences of the number 14 in the series. Next, we need to find out how many times the number 14 appears in the pattern:  Somavara (day), Mangalavara (week), Budi Vara (month), Adityavara (year) (a pattern of days, weeks, months, and years) Now, let's count the number of times the number 14 appears in this pattern:  Somavara (day) - occurs once in every 7 days, so it appears 14/7 = 2 times per week; Mangalavara (week) - occurs once in every 7 weeks, so it appears 14/7 = 2 times per month; Budi Vara (month) - occurs once in every 12 months, so it appears 14/12 = 1 time per year; Adityavara (year) - occurs once in every 12 years, so it appears 14/12 = 0 times Since the number 14 does not appear at all in the pattern, the answer is 0. So, the total number of times the number 14 appears in both the series and the pattern is 3 + 0 = 3."

Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 15 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 15, 23, 34, 46, 59, 70, 82, 95, 108, 121, 134, 147, 160, 173, 186, 199, 212, 225, 238, 251, 264, 277, 290, 303, 316, 329, 342, 355, 368, 381, 394, 407, 420, 433, 446, 459, 472, 485, 498, 511, 524, 537, 550, 563, 576, 589, 602, 615, 628, 641, 654, 667, 680, 693, 706, 719, 732, 745, 758, 771, 784, 797, 810, 823, 836, 849, 862, 875, 888, 901, 914, 927, 940, 953, 966, 979, 992, 1005, 1018, 1031, 1044, 1057, 1070, 1083, 1096, 1109, 1122, 1135, 1148, 1161, 1174, 1187, 1200, 1213,
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between two dates.  The first date is July 13 and the second date is August 10. So, the difference between these two dates is 28 days (August 10 - July 13). Now, we need to calculate the number of months between these two dates. There are 30 days in each month, so the total number of months between July 13 and August 10 is 28 / 30 = 9.67 months. Since we can't have a fraction of a month, we round it off to 10 months. Therefore, the answer is 10 months.
Response:  We know that Julie is 7 years old and has 13 teeth.  So, she has 7 + 13 = 20 teeth in total. Now, we are asked how many of her teeth are in front. Since we know that all of Julie's teeth are in front (since she doesn't have any teeth behind), we can say that all 20 of her teeth are in front. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that Julie is 12 years old and has 14 teeth.  If she loses one tooth every year, then in 34 years, she will have lost 34 teeth. Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  We know that Julie is 19 years old and has been working at Somavaar for 3 months. So, her total work experience is 3 \* 3 = 9 months.  Now, we need to calculate how many days she has worked in each of the last 6 months.  For the first month (June), she worked for 30 days. For July, she worked for 25 days (since it was a leap year). For August, she worked for 31 days. And for September, October, and November, she worked for 30 days each. Finally, in December, she worked for 27 days (since it was a leap year again). Therefore, the total number of days Julie worked during her 9-month tenure at Somavaar is: 30 + 25 + 31 + 30 + 30 + 27 = 247 days.
Response:  The first mangrove forest has 5 pillars and the second one has 6 pillars. So, if we want to know how many pillars there are in total between both the forests, we need to add the number of pillars in each forest. Therefore, the total number of pillars is 5 + 6 = 11 pillars.
Response:  We know that Julie is 18 years old and has been studying for 3 months.  So, her current level of proficiency in English is 3 x 18 = 54 months.  Now, we need to convert this number into years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can divide 54 by 12 to get the approximate number of years it would take Julie to reach her goal. Therefore, the answer is approximately 4.5 years.
Response:  We know that Julie is 4 feet tall and Tom is 6 feet tall. So, if we draw a line from Julie to Tom, it will be 2 feet long (since 6 - 4 = 2). Now, let's find out how many pegs are there between them. There are 17 pegs between them (since 17 - 2 = 15). Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  We know that Babi has 25 marbles in total and he lost 4 of them. So, he has 21 marbles left. Now, we are asked how many marbles does Babi have after 20 days. Since each day, Babi loses 4 marbles, so after 20 days, he will lose 80 marbles (20 x 4). Therefore, Babi has 21 - 80 = -59 marbles after 20 days.
Response:  We know that Babi has 28 bags of rice and he wants to distribute them equally among 42 people. So, each person will get 1 bag of rice (28/42 = 0.67). Now, we have to find out how many bags of rice each person will get if there are 63 people in total. To do this, we need to divide the number of bags of rice available (63) by the total number of people (including Babi): (63 / 65 = 0.98). Therefore, each person will get approximately 0.98 bags of rice.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Babi has touched each of the 33 Mukukulam. Since she touched them in pairs, we need to divide the total number of touches (48) by 2. So, the number of times Babi touched each of the 33 Mukukulams is:  Number of times Babi touched each of the 33 Mukukulams = Total number of touches / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24  Therefore, Babi touched each of the 33 Mukukulams 24 times.
Response:  We know that Babi has 38 mukkulas and he gave 16 of them to his friend. So, now Babi has 22 mukkulas left. Now, we need to find out how many times 22 mukkulas can be divided into 36 marigolds. To do this, we divide 22 by 36, which gives us approximately 0.64. Therefore, Babi's friend got approximately 0.64 x 16 = 10.04 mukkulas from Babi.
Response:  We know that Babi has 20 mukkulas and he gave 18 of them to his friend. So, we have 20 - 18 = 2 left with Babi.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Babi has played cards in total and then divide it by 5 to get the average number of games per day. So, let's calculate the total number of card plays as follows:  Total number of card plays = Number of days x Number of card plays per day  In this case, we know that Babi has played cards for 21 days, so the total number of card plays is:  Total number of card plays = 21 x 5 = 105  Now, we need to divide the total number of card plays by the number of days he played to get the average number of games per day:  Average number of games per day = Total number of card plays / Number of days  Therefore, the average number of games Babi played per day is:  Average number of games per day = 105 / 21 = 4.86 (round off to 4.9)
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 22 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The sequence is : 10, 22, 34, 46, 58, 70, 82, 94, 106, 118, 130, 142, 154, 166, 178, 190, 202, 214, 226, 238, 250, 262, 274, 286, 298, 310, 322, 334, 346, 358, 370, 382, 394, 406, 418, 430, 442, 454, 466, 478, 490, 502, 514, 526, 538, 550, 562, 574, 586, 598, 610, 622, 634, 646, 658, 670, 682, 694, 706, 718, 730, 742, 754, 766, 778, 790, 802, 814, 826, 838, 850, 862, 874, 886, 898, 910, 922, 934, 946, 958, 970, 982, 994, 1006, 1018, 1030, 1042, 1054, 1066, 1078, 1090, 1102, 1114, 1126, 
Response:  We have 19 balls and we need to find out how many of them are red. So, if we take 2 balls at random, the probability that both of them are red is (1/5) × (1/5) = 1/25. Now, let's assume that none of the remaining 17 balls are red (which means that all of them are blue). So, the probability that the next ball drawn at random from the remaining 17 balls is red is (1/17) × (1/16) = 1/320. Therefore, the total number of red balls among the 19 balls is 1 + (1/320) = 19/320.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 32 is divisible by 4.  So, we need to divide 32 by 4 and see if it gives us an integer or not.  When we divide 32 by 4, we get 8 with no remainder. Therefore, the number of times 32 is divisible by 4 is 8.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 17 is divisible by 3 in a range of 15 to 40.  So, we need to count the number of multiples of 17 that are between 15 and 40.  There are 8 multiples of 17 between 15 and 40: 17 x 2 = 34, 17 x 3 = 51, 17 x 4 = 68, 17 x 5 = 85, 17 x 6 = 102, 17 x 7 = 119, 17 x 8 = 136, 17 x 9 = 153. Therefore, there are 8 multiples of 17 between 15 and 40.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 30 is divisible by 5.  So, we need to divide 30 by 5 and see if it gives us any remainder.  If there is no remainder, then that means 30 is divisible by 5 exactly once.  Otherwise, if there is a remainder, then that means 30 is not divisible by 5 exactly once.  Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the five numbers (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) appears in the remaining three places after we remove one number from the list of five numbers.  So, let's do that.  After removing one number from the list of five numbers, there will be four numbers left. The possible combinations are:  (10, 20, 30, 40), (10, 20, 30, 50), (10, 20, 40, 50), (10, 20, 30, 40). Each combination has a frequency of 4/6 = 2/3. Therefore, the probability of any particular number appearing in any given place is 2/3.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them equally among the three baskets. So, firstly we need to count the number of balls given in the problem statement. There are 5 balls in the first basket, 7 balls in the second basket, and 3 balls in the third basket. Therefore, the total number of balls is 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 balls. Now, we need to divide these 15 balls equally among the three baskets. Since there are 3 baskets, each basket will get 5 balls (15 / 3 = 5). So, the final answer is 5 balls per basket.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 3 appears in the following three numbers: 17, 24, and 31.  So, we need to count the number of times 3 appears in each of these numbers.  In the first number, 17, the digit 3 appears once.  In the second number, 24, the digit 3 appears twice. And in the third number, 31, the digit 3 appears thrice. Therefore, the total number of times the digit 3 appears in these three numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them equally among the six players.  So, we need to calculate the total number of balls first.  From the given information, we know that there are 6 bouncers and each bouncer has 4 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls = 6 x 4 = 24 balls. Now, we need to divide these 24 balls equally among the six players. Since there are six players, each player will get 4/6 = 2/3 of the total number of balls, which is 12 balls (since 2/3 x 24 = 12). So, each player will get 12 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them equally among the five players. So, we need to calculate the total number of balls first.  From the given information, we know that there are 5 bouncers and each bouncer has 6 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls = 5 x 6 = 30 balls. Now, we need to divide these 30 balls equally among the five players. Since there are 5 players, each player will get 30/5 = 6 balls. So, the answer is 6 balls per player.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Alana can throw in one minute if she throws 5 balls at a time and each ball takes her 10 seconds to throw.  So, in one minute, she will throw 5 x 60 = 300 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Alana can throw in one minute if she throws 4 balls at a time and takes 3 minutes to complete each set of 4 balls.  So, in total, it will take her 12 minutes (3 x 4) to complete all 4 sets of 4 balls.  Now, let's calculate the number of balls she can throw in one minute:  Number of balls thrown per minute = Total time taken for all sets / Time taken to complete one set  = 12 minutes / 3 minutes  = 4 balls/minute Therefore, Alana can throw 4 balls in one minute.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them equally among the six players. So, we need to calculate the total number of balls first.  From the given information, we know that there are 2 big bags containing 6 balls each, and one small bag containing 3 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is: 2 x 6 = 12 + 3 = 15 balls. Now, we need to divide these 15 balls equally among the six players. Since there are six players, each player will get 15/6 = 2.5 balls. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a ball, each player will get 3 balls. Therefore, the final answer is 3 balls per player.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls Alana can hold in her hand at most.  Since she has 5 fingers in each of her hands, and each finger can hold one ball, we can say that Alana can hold up to 5 balls in each of her hands. Therefore, the total number of balls Alana can hold is 5 x 2 = 10 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the six numbers appears in both lists.  The first number is 4, which appears only once in List A and twice in List B, so it contributes 2 points (1 + 1).  The second number is 5, which appears only once in List A and thrice in List B, so it contributes 3 points (1 + 2 + 1).  Similarly, we can calculate the contribution of each number as follows:  Number 3: appears only once in List A and twice in List B, contributing 2 points (1 + 1) Number 4: appears only once in List A and three times in List B, contributing 3 points (1 + 2 + 1) Number 5: appears only once in List A and four times in List B, contributing 4 points (1 + 3 + 1 + 1) Number 6: appears only once in List A and five times in List B, contributing 5 points (1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1) Therefore, the total number of points contributed by the six numbers is: 4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 20 So, there are 20 common pairs between the two lists.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls can fit in each jar and then calculate the total number of jars required to hold all the balls.  The capacity of each jar is given as 6 balls per jar. So, we need to divide the total number of balls by 6 to get the number of jars required.  Total number of balls = 20 balls. Number of jars required = Total number of balls / Capacity of each jar = 20 balls / 6 balls/jar = 3 jars. Therefore, we require 3 jars to hold all the 20 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them equally among 6 players. So, we need to calculate the number of balls per player.  There are 5 big balls and 1 small ball, so the total number of balls is 5 + 1 = 6. Now, if we want to divide these 6 balls equally among 6 players, each player will get 1 ball. Therefore, the answer is 1 ball per player.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them into groups of 5 each. So, the number of groups = Total number of balls / Number of balls in each group = 59 / 5 = 12 groups. Therefore, there will be 12 groups of 5 balls each.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then divide them into groups of 7, 6, 5, and 4.  So, let's count the number of balls first.  There are 10 balls in total. Now, we can divide them as follows: 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 22 balls. Therefore, there are 22 balls in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 5 bellows can be used in total.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of times each bellows is used once.  For example, if we use the first bellows for 30 seconds, then it will be used once. Similarly, if we use the second bellows for 20 seconds, then it will also be used once. Therefore, the total number of uses of the first bellows is 1 (once), and the total number of uses of the second bellows is also 1 (once). Now, let's move on to the third bellows. If we use this bellows for 40 seconds, then it will be used twice. So, the total number of uses of all three bellows together is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 2 appears in the given series of numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,?. Since each term is twice the previous one, we can conclude that the next term will be 32. Therefore, the answer is (3).
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 6 gants (groups) in the English syllabus is repeated in the Telugu syllabus.  There are 2 groups in the English syllabus that are not present in the Telugu syllabus - Group A and Group B. So, we need to subtract their repetitions from the total number of repetitions.  Now, let's count the number of repetitions for each group in the Telugu syllabus:  Group C - 3 repetitions; Group D - 4 repetitions; Group E - 5 repetitions; Group F - 7 repetitions; Group G - 8 repetitions. Therefore, the total number of repetitions in the Telugu syllabus is 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 30. Since there are 6 gants in the English syllabus, the number of times each gant is repeated in the Telugu syllabus is 30 / 6 = 5. So, each gant is repeated 5 times in the Telugu syllabus."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 7 appears in both the sets.  Since there are 6 elements in set A and 7 elements in set B, we can list them as follows:  Set A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} Set B: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. Now, let's count how many times each number appears in both sets: Number of appearances of each number in both sets: 1 - 2 times (appears in both sets) 2 - 1 time (only in set A) 3 - 0 times (not present in either set) 4 - 1 time (only in set B) 5 - 1 time (only in set B) 6 - 2 times (present in both sets) 7 - 2 times (present in both sets). Therefore, the difference between the number of times each number appears in set A and set B is: Difference = 2 - (-1) = 3. So, there are 3 numbers that appear only once in either set A or set B.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the four numbers (10, 25, 50, and 75) appears in the given set of 16 numbers.  Firstly, we can see that the number 10 appears once in the set {10, 25, 50, 75}.  Secondly, we can observe that the number 25 appears twice in the set {10, 25, 50, 75}. Thirdly, we can notice that the number 50 appears thrice in the set {10, 25, 50, 75}. Lastly, we can see that the number 75 appears once in the set {10, 25, 50, 75}. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each of these four numbers is as follows: Number of appearances of 10 = 1; Number of appearances of 25 = 2; Number of appearances of 50 = 3; Number of appearances of 75 = 1. Now, we need to convert these counts into fractions or decimals. For example, the count of 10 appearsances can be expressed as 1/16, since there are 16 numbers in the set. Similarly, the count of 25 appearances can be expressed as 2/16, and so on. Therefore, the final answer is: Total number of appearances of each of the four numbers = 1/16 + 2/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 8/16."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 gants in total and each gant has 30 seconds of work time. So, the total work time for all 7 gants is:

7 x 30 = 210 seconds
Now, we need to subtract the time taken by Chennai from the total work time. According to the question, Chennai took 2 hours which is equal to 120 minutes. So, the remaining work time after Chennai finished his work is:

Total Work Time - Chennai's Work Time = 210 seconds - 120 minutes = 90 minutes
Therefore, the number of gants that can be completed in 90 minutes is:

Number of Gants = Total Work Time / Work Time per Gant = 90 minutes / 30 seconds = 3 gants
So, out of the 7 gants, 3 gants can be completed in 90 minutes."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 gants in total and we have already used 2 of them to make the English sentence ""Chinese people"" (which has 4 words). So, we have 3 remaining gants left. Now, let's count how many words are present in each of the remaining 3 sentences: 1) ప్రతి రోజు ర్యాన్ - 4 words; 2) చైనీస్ నేర్చు - 4 words; 3) ఇంగ్లీష్ నేర్చు - 4 words. Therefore, we can use all 3 remaining gants to formulate the answer."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 6 guntas (angles) appears in the 12 triangles formed by connecting the dots in the grid.  Each triangle has 3 sides and 3 angles, so we need to count the number of times each angle appears in all 12 triangles.  The 6 possible angles are $0^\circ$, $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, $90^\circ$, $120^\circ$, and $180^\circ$.  Since there are 12 triangles, each angle appears once in each triangle, except for $0^\circ$ which appears twice since it is shared between two adjacent triangles. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each angle is:  $0^\circ$: 2 $\times$ 12 = 24 $30^\circ$: 1 $\times$ 12 = 12 $60^\circ$: 1 $\times$ 12 = 12 $90^\circ$: 1 $\times$ 12 = 12 $120^\circ$: 1 $\times$ 12 = 12 $180^\circ$: 1 $\times$ 12 = 12 So, the total number of appearances of each angle is:  $0^\circ$: 24 $30^\circ$: 12 $60^\circ$: 12 $90^\circ$: 12 $120^\circ$: 12 $180^\circ$: 12 Now, let's calculate the percentage of each angle:  $0^\circ$: 24/60 = 40% $30^\circ$: 12/60 = 20% $60^\circ$: 12/60 = 20% $90^\circ$: 12/60 = 20% $120^\circ$: 12/60 = 20% $180^\circ$: 12/60 = 20% So, the distribution of angles in the grid is approximately uniform with each angle appearing about 20% of the time.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 6 gants (rojus) in the first row repeats itself among all the 10 rows.  Since there are 5 chains (gantas), we need to count how many times each roju appears in each chain.  For example, if a particular roju appears twice in one chain, it means that roju has repeated itself once in that chain. So, we multiply the number of appearances of that roju in each chain and divide it by 5 to get the total number of repetitions of that roju among all the 10 rows. Similarly, for the remaining 5 rojus, we repeat this process. Now, let's calculate the total number of repetitions of each roju:  Roju 1:  Appears 3 times in Chain 1, 4 times in Chain 2, and 2 times in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 3 + 4 + 2 = 9.  Roju 2: Appears 2 times in Chain 1, 3 times in Chain 2, and 1 time in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.  Roju 3: Appears 1 time in Chain 1, 2 times in Chain 2, and 3 times in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  Roju 4: Appears 2 times in Chain 1, 1 time in Chain 2, and 3 times in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.  Roju 5: Appears 1 time in Chain 1, 2 times in Chain 2, and 1 time in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.  Roju 6: Appears 3 times in Chain 1, 2 times in Chain 2, and 1 time in Chain 3. Total repetitions = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. Therefore, the total number of repetitions of each roju among all the 10 rows is:  Ro
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 5 guntas (rojus) repeats in the 12 years.  Since there are 12 years, we can repeat each gunta once or twice. So, the number of times each gunta repeats is:

5 guntas x 12 years = 60 repetitions
Now, let's count how many times each chinni (ganta) repeats in those 60 repetitions:

Since there are 60 repetitions, and each ganta repeats for 4 years, then each chinni repeats:

60 x 4 = 240 times
So, the answer is 240."
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 86 appears in the given set of 40 numbers.  Since there are 40 numbers in total, we can divide them into groups of 4 numbers each as follows: Group 1: 1, 2, 3, 4; Group 2: 5, 6, 7, 8; Group 3: 9, 10, 11, 12; Group 4: 13, 14, 15, 16. Now, let's count how many times each number appears in each group: Group 1: Number 1 appears once, number 2 appears twice, number 3 appears thrice, and number 4 appears four times. Total appearances of number 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Similarly, for other numbers, their total appearances are as follows: Group 2: Number 5 appears once, number 6 appears twice, number 7 appears thrice, and number 8 appears four times. Total appearances of number 5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Group 3: Number 9 appears once, number 10 appears twice, number 11 appears thrice, and number 12 appears four times. Total appearances of number 9 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Group 4: Number 13 appears once, number 14 appears twice, number 15 appears thrice, and number 16 appears four times. Total appearances of number 13 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the total number of times each number appears in the given set of 40 numbers is as follows: Number 1: 10 appearances; Number 2: 10 appearances; Number 3: 10 appearances; Number 4: 10 appearances; Number 5: 10 appearances; Number 6: 10 appearances; Number 7: 10 appearances; Number 8: 10 appearances; Number 9: 10 appearances; Number 10: 10 appearances; Number 11: 1"

The letter ""E"" appears once in ""ENGLISH"", and twice in ""INDIAN CHINESE"". Therefore, the number of times the letter ""E"" appears in the phrase is 2. Similarly, we can count the appearances of other letters in the word ""ENGLISH"" and the phrase ""INDIAN CHINESE"".  Thus, the total number of times each letter in the word ""ENGLISH"" appears in the phrase is: E - 2, I - 1, G - 1, L - 1, S - 1, H - 1. So, there are 7 letters in the word ""ENGLISH"" that appear in the phrase ""INDIAN CHINESE""."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 58 appears in the given sequence.  The first number is 3, which means it appears once in the sequence.  The second number is 6, which means it appears twice in the sequence.  The third number is 7, which means it appears thrice in the sequence.  Therefore, we can write down the following equation: 3 + 2(6) + 3(7) = 58.  Solving for the unknown quantity, we get: 3 + 12 + 21 = 58.  Simplifying further, we get: 24 = 58.  So, there are 24 numbers that appear exactly once in the given sequence.

Response:  We know that there are 10 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, in total, there are 24 x 10 = 240 hours in a month. Now, we need to calculate how many hours are spent on dubbing for each of the 4 roles (actor, director, producer, and screenwriter). Let's assume that each role takes an equal amount of time to dub. Therefore, the number of hours spent on dubbing for each role can be calculated as follows:  Actor - 4 hours/day x 30 days/month = 120 hours Director - 4 hours/day x 30 days/month = 120 hours Producer - 4 hours/day x 30 days/month = 120 hours Screenwriter - 4 hours/day x 30 days/month = 120 hours Total hours spent on dubbing = 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 560 hours In conclusion, if we spend 560 hours on dubbing for each of the 4 roles, then the total number of hours spent on dubbing for all 4 roles is 560 x 4 = 2240 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many debit cards are there in total and then divide it by 10 to get the number of debit cards per employee. So, let's calculate the total number of debit cards first. According to the question, there are 10 employees in the company, and each employee has an average of 3 debit cards. Therefore, the total number of debit cards = 10 x 3 = 30 debit cards. Now, we need to divide the total number of debit cards by 10 to get the number of debit cards per employee. Number of debit cards per employee = Total number of debit cards / 10 = 30/10 = 3 debit cards per employee.

Now, we need to find out how many hours are spent on dubbing for Telugu movies in a year. According to the question, it takes around 3 months for one movie to be completely dubbed into Telugu language. Therefore, if we assume that all these 3 months are continuous without any breaks, then the total number of hours spent on dubbing for Telugu movies in a year would be (3 x 90) x 24 = 5760 hours. So, the answer is 5760 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the digit 1 appears in the given string of numbers.  To do this, we can count the number of digits in each number and see if they contain the digit 1.  For example, the first number is 17, which has one digit (the 1). The second number is 16, which also has only one digit (the 1). Therefore, there are two numbers that contain the digit 1.  Now let's move on to the next number, which is 15. This number also contains only one digit (the 1), so there are three numbers that contain the digit 1.  We can continue this process for all the remaining numbers, and since there are 10 numbers in total, there must be at least 10 occurrences of the digit 1 in the given string of numbers.  So, the answer is 10.

Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 21 pieces of leather.  Since each shoe requires 4-5 pieces of leather, we need to divide 21 by 4 or 5 to get the number of shoes that can be made.  If we divide 21 by 4, we get 5. So, there are 5 pairs of shoes that can be made from 21 pieces of leather.  But wait! There's more! The problem states that some of the leather is wasted during cutting and stitching, so we need to subtract that amount from the total number of shoes. Let's assume that 30% of the leather is wasted (this is just an estimate). To calculate this, we multiply the total number of shoes by 0.3 (which gives us 0.6 in decimal form). Now, we subtract this amount from the original number of shoes to get the final number of shoes that can be made. In this case, if we subtract 0.6 from 5, we get 4. So, there are 4 pairs of shoes that can be made from 21 pieces of leather after accounting for waste.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 20 pieces of leather.  Since each shoe requires 4-5 pieces of leather, we need to divide 20 by 4 or 5 to get the number of shoes that can be made.  If we divide 20 by 4, we get 5, which means 5 pairs of shoes can be made from 20 pieces of leather.  Similarly, if we divide 20 by 5, we also get 5 as the result, which means again 5 pairs of shoes can be made from 20 pieces of leather. Therefore, there are 5 pairs of shoes that can be made from 20 pieces of leather.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 16 pieces of leather. Since there are 13 erasable parts in each shoe, we need to divide 16 by 13 to get the number of pairs of shoes that can be made. Therefore, the answer is 12 pairs of shoes (16 / 13 = 12).
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made using 19 eri and 4 types of fabric.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of pairs of shoes that can be made with each type of fabric separately.  For example, if we use 10 pieces of cloth for one pair of shoes, then we can make 4 x 10 = 40 pairs of shoes using all four fabrics. Similarly, if we use 20 pieces of cloth for one pair of shoes, then we can make 4 x 20 = 80 pairs of shoes using all four fabrics. Therefore, there are 40 + 80 = 120 pairs of shoes that can be made using all four fabrics. Now, let's see how many pairs of shoes can be made using just 19 eri. If we use 19 eri for one pair of shoes, then we can make 19 / 4 = 5 pairs of shoes using only 19 eri. So, in total, there are 120 + 5 = 125 pairs of shoes that can be made using both eri and fabric.
Response:  We know that there are 10 balls in each basket and we have to find out how many baskets will be required to contain all the 50 balls. So, the total number of balls = 10 x 5 = 50. Now, since we want to divide these 50 balls equally among 4 baskets, we need to put 12.5 balls in each basket (since 4 divided by 5 is 0.8). Therefore, the number of baskets needed = 50 / 12.5 = 4.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 60 can be divided into 2 equal parts.  So, we need to divide 60 by 2.  When we divide 60 by 2, we get 30.  Therefore, there are 30 equal parts in total.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 4 appears in the series of numbers given after each word in the sentence.  The first number is 4, then it is 16, then 25, and so on. So, we can see that every fourth number is equal to 4. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of the number 4 in the series is 8 (since there are 8 numbers in the series).  Hence, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, in total, we have 7 x 24 = 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Jerry spends on social media per day. According to the question, Jerry spends 3-4 hours on social media every day. Therefore, he spends (3 + 4) x 7 = 21 - 28 hours on social media per week. Since there are 168 hours in a week, Jerry spends approximately 168 / 21 = 7.9 - 10.5 hours on social media per week.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 22 letters in the Telugu alphabet appears in the given text.  Since there are 6 words in the text, we will count the number of occurrences of each letter in each word separately and then add them up.  Here is what we get:

Now let's count the number of appearances of each digit:  * 0 : Appears once (in the first position)  * 1 : Appears twice (in positions 2 and 9)  * 2 : Appears thrice (in positions 3, 6, and 8)  * 3 : Appears four times (in positions 4, 5, 7, and 10)  * 4 : Appears five times (in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9)  * 5 : Appears six times (in positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10)  * 6 : Appears seven times (in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9)  * 7 : Appears eight times (in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9)  * 8 : Appears nine times (in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9)  * 9 : Appears ten times (in all positions except for the first one) Therefore, there are 10 different digits in the given string of 12 digits."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 10 appears in the shuffled deck of cards.  Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards, we can assume that each number will appear once in every 52/10 = 5.2 cards. Therefore, the probability of getting any particular card (say, the $5$th card) is $\frac{1}{5}$. Similarly, the probability of getting any particular combination of two cards (e.g., the $5$th and $6$th cards) is $\frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{25}$. Now, let's count the total number of ways to arrange the first 10 cards of the shuffled deck: There are $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$ ways to arrange the first 10 cards of the shuffled deck. However, since we are only interested in the first 10 cards, we need to divide this number by $10!$. Therefore, the required probability is $\frac{120}{10!} \approx 0.978$.

"Response:  We have to find out how many shelves are there in Jerry's room and how many books are there in each shelf.  From the given information, we know that there are 7 shelves in total and each shelf has 4 books. So, the total number of books in Jerry's room is:

7 x 4 = 28 books

Now, we need to find out how many books are there in each shelf. Since each shelf has 4 books, the number of books in each shelf is:

4 books/shelf

So, the total number of books in each shelf is:

4 x 7 = 28 books

Therefore, the total number of books in Jerry's room is:

28 books + 28 books = 56 books

Answer: 56 books"
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 5 numbers appears in the shuffled deck.  Since there are 9 cards in total, we can calculate the number of appearances as follows:  Number of appearances = Total number of cards / Number of unique cards = 9 / 5 = 1.8  So, each of the 5 numbers will appear approximately 1.8 times in the shuffled deck.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 8 balls can be used in total. Since there are 4 marbles per ball, we need to multiply 4 with the number of balls. So, the total number of uses for all 8 balls is: 8 x 4 = 32. Therefore, the answer is 32.

Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 7 with 24, we get 168 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Jerry spends playing video games in a week. According to the question, Jerry plays video games for 3 hours every day, which means he spends 3 x 7 = 21 hours playing video games in a week. Therefore, the answer is 168 - 21 = 147 hours.
Response:  We know that there are 10 shelves in total, and each shelf has 5 boxes. So, the total number of boxes is 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are in each shelf. To do this, we divide the total number of boxes (50) by the number of shelves (10). Therefore, each shelf contains 50 / 10 = 5 boxes.
"Response:  We know that there are 9 chakras in the human body and each chakra has 7 petals. So, the total number of petals in all 9 chakras is 63 (9 x 7 = 63). Now, we need to find out how many times these 63 petals appear in the 10 stages of spiritual growth mentioned in the question. To do this, we will count the number of times each stage mentions ""petal"" or ""chakra"". Stage 1 mentions ""petal"" only once, so it contributes 1/63 to the total. Similarly, Stage 2 mentions ""petal"" twice, so it contributes 2/63 to the total. And so on... By adding up all these contributions, we get the final answer of 548 (1 + 2 + 4 +... + 10 = 548). Therefore, the answer to the question is 548."
Response:  We have to find out how many shelves are there in Jerry's room and how many boxes are there in each shelf. Then we need to calculate the total number of boxes in all the shelves. Finally, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of people who want to buy them to get the average price per box. So, let's break it down like this:  Number of shelves in Jerry's room = 3 (as given in the question) Number of boxes in each shelf = 4 (as given in the question) Total number of boxes in all the shelves = 3 x 4 = 12 boxes Now, let's assume that 5 people want to buy these boxes. Therefore, the average price per box = Total number of boxes / Number of people who want to buy them = 12 boxes / 5 people = $2.40 per box.
Response:  We have to find out how many shelves are there in Jerry's room and how many boxes are there in each shelf. Then we need to calculate the total number of boxes in all the shelves. Finally, we need to divide the total number of boxes by the number of people who want to take them. So, the answer is: Number of shelves = 7 Shelves per box = 3 Boxes per shelf = 21 Total number of boxes = 2 x 3 x 7 = 42 People wanting to take boxes = 3 Therefore, the number of boxes that can fit in Jerry's room is 42 / 3 = 14.

"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 4 numbers appears in the remaining 5 numbers after repeating them 3 times.  So, we need to count the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 4 in the remaining 5 numbers.  The number of occurrences of each number is given below:
Number Occurrences
1 2
2 0
3 1
4 3
Now, let's calculate the total number of appearances of each number from 1 to 4 in the remaining 5 numbers:
Total Number of Appearances = (Number of Occurrences) x (Number of Remaining Numbers)
= (2) x (5)
= 10
Therefore, there are 10 appearances of the numbers from 1 to 4 in the remaining 5 numbers after repeating them 3 times."
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can choose 4 out of 10 people for a task and then divide them into groups of 6.  There are C(10,4) = 25 ways to choose 4 people from 10 options.  Now, there are C(6,2) = 10 ways to choose 2 people from 6 options (since we already have 4 people chosen). So, the total number of ways to choose 4 people and divide them into groups of 6 is: 25 x 10 = 250.
"Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can choose 3 piles from 5 piles and then how many ways we can choose 2 gadgets from each of those 3 piles.
So, total number of ways = Number of ways to choose 3 piles from 5 piles x Number of ways to choose 2 gadgets from each of those 3 piles.
Now, let's calculate these two factors separately:
Number of ways to choose 3 piles from 5 piles = 5C3 = 10
Number of ways to choose 2 gadgets from each of those 3 piles = 3 x 2 = 6
Therefore, total number of ways = 10 x 6 = 60."
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 3 piles of rice and 4 plates.  Firstly, let's consider the number of ways we can arrange the 3 piles of rice. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them. Now, let's count the number of ways we can place each pile on one of the 4 plates. Since there is only one plate left after placing all three piles, we need to divide the total number of ways by 4. Therefore, the final answer is: 6 x 4 = 24. So, there are 24 ways to arrange 3 piles of rice and 4 plates.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 3 letters in each of the 6 positions.  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange 3 letters in a row (ignoring order). So, there are 6 x 6 x 3! = 108 ways to arrange 3 letters in each of the 6 positions. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the given letters is 108.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 4 piles of rice and 6 plates.  There are 4! = 24 ways to arrange 4 piles of rice.  Each pile has 6 pieces, so there are 6 x 24 = 144 ways to arrange 6 plates. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 4 piles of rice and 6 plates is 24 x 144 = 3360.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can choose 3 paks from 9 options and then combine them with 4 gadals from 12 options in total of 3*4=12 ways. So, the answer is 12.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 6 piles of rice and 3 bags of wheat such that each pile of rice has at least one bag of wheat in it.  There are 6! = 720 ways to arrange the 6 piles of rice.  Now, for each arrangement of the piles of rice, there are 3! = 6 ways to choose the 3 bags of wheat to put in them. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange both is: 720 x 6 = 4320. So, there are 4320 ways to arrange both.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 4 piles of rice and 3 bags of wheat such that each pile of rice has at least one bag of wheat in it.  There are 6 ways to arrange the piles of rice (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Now, for each arrangement of the piles of rice, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the bags of wheat (since there are no restrictions on the order in which they are placed). Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange both the piles of rice and the bags of wheat is: 6 x 6 = 36. So, there are 36 ways to arrange the given items.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 6 pakshees can be used in total.  Each pakshee has 4 marugu jathis (lines) and 8 anuswaras (notes). So, there are a total of 4 x 8 = 32 notes in each pakshee. Now, we need to count how many times each pakshee is used in the given text. For example, the first pakshee is used 7 times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 7. Similarly, the second pakshee is used 5 times, the third pakshee is used 9 times, and so on. Therefore, the final answer is 7 + 5 + 9 +... = 30.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 5 objects from a set of 10 objects such that no two objects are alike.  There are 10C5 = 50 ways to arrange 5 objects from a set of 10 objects without any repetition. Therefore, there are 50 ways to satisfy the condition given in the question.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 3 objects in a row such that no two adjacent objects are the same.  There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange 3 objects in a row without any repetition. So, there are 6 possible answers.
Response:  We have 5 gadgets and we want to pack them in 3 boxes. So, each box will contain 5/3 = 1.67 gadgets. Now, there are 4 remaining gadgets which we cannot fit into any of the boxes. Therefore, the answer is 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 gadgets that can be packed in 3 boxes.
Response:  We have 6 balls and we want to put them in 2 boxes of equal size.  So, we can divide the 6 balls into 2 groups of 3 each. Now, let's assume that each box has a capacity of x cubic units.  Since there are 3 balls in each group, the total volume of balls in one group is 3x. Similarly, the total volume of balls in the other group is also 3x. Therefore, the total volume of all 6 balls is 6x.
Response:  We have to find out how many ways we can arrange 3 objects in 6 boxes with 2 empty spaces each.  There are 6! = 720 possible combinations of arranging 3 objects in 6 boxes. However, since there are 2 empty spaces in each box, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where all 3 objects are placed in one box (which is 1). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 3 objects in 6 boxes with 2 empty spaces each is 720 - 1 = 719.
Response:  We have two sets of numbers - set A and set B. Set A has 2 elements each with a value of 48, while set B has 11 elements with a value of 11 each. So, in total we have 48 + 11 = 59 elements in both sets combined. Therefore, there are 59 paisa (coins) in total.
Response:  We have two sets of numbers - set A and set B. Set A consists of 25 numbers, and each number in this set is either 1 or 2 times the previous number (i.e., if the previous number was x, then the next number in set A would be either 2x or 1/2x). Similarly, set B consists of 37 numbers, where each number is either 1 or 2 times the previous number. Now, we need to find out how many numbers in set B are equal to the corresponding numbers in set A. To do this, we can use the fact that every number in set B is either 1 or 2 times the corresponding number in set A. Therefore, for any given number y in set B, there exists an integer k such that y = 2k or y = k/2, depending on whether y is even or odd. Using this observation, we can count the number of numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A as follows: For the first number in set B, say y = 2k, there exists an integer m such that y = 2m, so the number of numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A is 1. For the second number in set B, say y = k/2, there exists an integer n such that y = n/2, so the number of numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A is 1/2. In general, for the ith number in set B, say y = 2ki, there exists an integer j such that y = 2j, so the number of numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A is 2ij. Therefore, the total number of numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A is: 25 + 50 + 70 +... + 2ij = 37 \* sum(1/2^k) = 37 \* ∑(1/2^k) = 37 \* π = 126.5. So, there are exactly 126 and half numbers in set B that are equal to their corresponding numbers in set A.
Response:  We have two sets of numbers - set A and set B. Set A has 2 elements (15 and 45), while set B has 60 elements. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of numbers from set A can be formed using all the 60 elements of set B. To do this, we will use multiplication. So, the number of pairs of numbers that can be formed is equal to the product of the number of elements in set A and the number of elements in set B, which is 60 x 2 = 120. Therefore, there are 120 pairs of numbers that can be formed using both sets.
Response:  We have two sets of numbers - set A and set B. Set A has 2 elements (10 and 20), while set B has 36 elements (1 to 36). Now, we need to find out how many elements are common between these two sets. To do this, we will subtract the number of elements in set B from the total number of elements in set A, which is 46 (2 + 36). So, the number of common elements between set A and set B is 46 - 36 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 elements that are common between set A and set B.
Response:  The number of puppets in the first group is 3, and each puppet has 66 pegs. Therefore, the total number of pegs in the first group is 3 x 66 = 198 pegs. Similarly, the number of puppets in the second group is 35, and each puppet has 35 pegs. So, the total number of pegs in the second group is 35 x 35 = 1,275 pegs. Finally, there are 24 puppets in the third group, and each puppet has 24 pegs. Thus, the total number of pegs in the third group is 24 x 24 = 576 pegs. In summary, the total number of pegs among all three groups is 198 + 1,275 + 576 = 2,049 pegs.
Response:  We have three types of people - 91, 23 and 25. So, we need to find out how many pensioners are there in each category.  For type 1 (91), we have 91 pensioners. For type 2 (23), we have 23 x 2 = 46 pensioners (since there are twice as many pensioners in this category). And for type 3 (25), we have 25 x 3 = 75 pensioners (since there are thrice as many pensioners in this category). Therefore, the total number of pensioners is 91 + 46 + 75 = 192 pensioners.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the three numbers (35, 18, and 3) appears in the list of 30 numbers.  So, we will divide the total number of numbers by each of these three numbers.  For example, if there are 35 numbers that contain the digit 3, then we can say that 3 appears 35/3 = 11 times in the list. Similarly, if there are 18 numbers that contain the digit 1, then we can say that 1 appears 18/1 = 18 times in the list. Now, let's calculate the total number of appearances of each digit in the list:  Total appearances of 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 Total appearances of 1 = 18 Total appearances of 0 = 0 Therefore, the answer is 14 for the first option and 0 for the second option.
Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are there in each of the three categories - less than 50, between 50 and 100, and more than 100.  For the first category (less than 50), we have 3 numbers (26, 34, and 48).  For the second category (between 50 and 100), we have 19 numbers (53, 67, 75, 89, etc.).  And for the third category (more than 100), we have 7 numbers (101, 105, 109, 113, etc.).  Therefore, the total number of numbers is 3 + 19 + 7 = 39.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given list such that their difference is equal to 61.  To do this, we can use the following approach:  Firstly, we will find the smallest number and largest number in the list.  Then, we will check whether any pair of numbers from the list has a difference of exactly 61. If yes, then we will mark it as a correct pair. Otherwise, we will move to the next pair of numbers in the list and repeat the same process until we reach the end of the list.  Now, let's apply this approach to the given list:  The smallest number in the list is 20, and the largest number is 89. So, we will start checking the pairs of numbers between these two limits.  For example, the pair (47,53) has a difference of 61, so we will mark it as a correct pair. Similarly, the pair (64,37) also has a difference of 61, so we will mark it as another correct pair.  Therefore, there are 2 pairs of numbers in the list that satisfy the condition.  Hence, the answer is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of 23 numbers such that their difference is equal to 10 or less.  So, we need to find out all the pairs of numbers from the given set whose difference is less than or equal to 10.  To do this, we can use the following approach:  Firstly, let us list down all the numbers from the given set: 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.  Now, let us find out which pairs of these numbers have a difference of less than or equal to 10:  (23, 33), (24, 34), (25, 35), (26, 36), (27, 37), (28, 38), (29, 39), (30, 40), (31, 41), (32, 42), (33, 43), (34, 44), (35, 45), (36, 46), (37, 47), (38, 48), (39, 49).  Therefore, there are 13 pairs of numbers in the given set of 23 numbers whose difference is less than or equal to 10.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in which one number is equal to twice the other number.  So, we need to find out the multiples of 2 between 81 and 68.  The multiples of 2 between 81 and 68 are 2 x 40 = 80, 2 x 41 = 82, 2 x 42 = 84,..., 2 x 79 = 158.  Therefore, there are 158 such pairs of numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 39 appears in the given sequence of numbers:  39, 78, 117, 156, 205, 244, 283, 322, 361, 400, 439,... (omitted)  As we can see, the number 39 appears once in this sequence. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We know that there are 61 shibirams in total and each shibiram has 7 days of rojgar. So, the total number of days of rojgar for all the shibirams is 61 x 7 = 427 days. Now, we need to find out how many days of rojgar are left after subtracting the number of days spent by Lord Rama during his exile. According to the question, Lord Rama spent 14 years in exile, which is equal to 14 x 30 = 420 days. Therefore, the remaining days of rojgar after subtraction are 427 - 420 = 17 days.
Response:  We know that there are 32 shibirams in one mandi. So, if we want to find out how many shibirams are there in 15 mandis, we need to multiply 32 with 15. Therefore, the number of shibirams in 15 mandis is 480 (32 x 15).
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, in total, we have 168 hours in a week (7 days x 24 hours). Now, let's calculate how many hours are spent on roaming in a year. Assuming that the person spends equal time roaming every day of the week, then the total number of hours spent on roaming in a year is: 168 hours/week x 52 weeks/year = 8,640 hours/year. Therefore, the person spends approximately 8,640 hours or 353 days roaming in a year.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 49 appears in the given sequence of 36 digits.  The first digit is 3, which occurs once in the sequence.  The second digit is 6, which occurs twice in the sequence.  The third digit is 7, which occurs three times in the sequence.  And so on...  Therefore, we can conclude that there are 3 + 2 + 3 +... + 3 = 15 instances of each number from 1 to 49 in the given sequence of 36 digits.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 30 appears in the given sequence.  The sequence is : 44, 39, 31, 27, 23, 19, 15, 11, 7, 4, 2.  Now we will count how many times each number appears in the sequence :  Number Appearance Count : 4 - 2 = 2 39 - 2 = 36 31 - 2 = 29 27 - 2 = 25 23 - 2 = 21 19 - 2 = 17 15 - 2 = 13 11 - 2 = 9 7 - 2 = 5 4 - 2 = 2 2 - 2 = 0 Total Count : 2 + 36 + 29 + 25 + 21 + 17 + 13 + 5 + 2 + 0 = 185 Therefore, there are 185 numbers that appear in the given sequence.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 48 appears in the given sequence.  The sequence is : 53, 48, 49, 50,... (repeating).  So, we can see that every number from 1 to 48 appears exactly once in the sequence. Therefore, there are 48 numbers between 1 and 48 that appear in the sequence.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 34 appears in the given sequence.  The sequence is : 33, 34, 27, 19, 10, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1.  Now we will count how many times each number appears in the sequence:  Number of appearances of 33 = 3 Number of appearances of 34 = 2 Number of appearances of 27 = 1 Number of appearances of 19 = 1 Number of appearances of 10 = 2 Number of appearances of 8 = 1 Number of appearances of 5 = 1 Number of appearances of 3 = 2 Number of appearances of 2 = 2 Number of appearances of 1 = 3 Therefore, there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 occurrences of numbers greater than or equal to 30 in the given sequence.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 50 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The first number is 13, which occurs only once in the sequence.  The second number is 47, which also occurs only once in the sequence.  Therefore, the total number of occurrences of these two numbers is 2 (i.e., 13 + 47).  Now let's move on to the next number, which is 21. This number occurs twice in the sequence (once at position 21 and once at position 48), so its contribution to the total count is 2. Similarly, we can calculate the contributions of all other numbers in the sequence as follows:  Number Position Contribution 13 1 2 47 2 21 2 35 3 41 2 47 1 59 1 Total Count = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 16 So, there are 16 numbers that occur more than once in the given sequence of numbers.

Response:  We know that there are 10 dogs in the house (6 + 4). Each dog has 3 tails, so the total number of tails is 3 x 10 = 30 tails. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of tails are there. To do this, we divide the total number of tails by 2, since each pair of tails consists of two tails. So, the number of pairs of tails is 30 / 2 = 15 pairs of tails. Therefore, there are 15 pairs of tails in the house.
Response:  We know that there are 10 dogs in total and each dog has 4 paws. So, the number of paws = 10 x 4 = 40 paws. Now, we need to find out how many paws Edgar has. Since Edgar is not one of the 10 dogs mentioned earlier, he must have fewer than 40 paws. Therefore, the answer is less than 40 paws.
Response:  We know that there are 6 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, in total, we have 6 x 24 = 144 hours in a week. Now, let's calculate how many hours Edith works in a week. According to the question, she works for 8 hours a day, which means she works for 8 x 7 = 56 hours in a week. Therefore, the difference between the number of hours Edith works and the number of hours in a week is 144 - 56 = 88 hours.
Response:  We know that there are 5 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is 5 x 24 = 120 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Edgar can work in a day. According to the question, he works for 8 hours a day. Therefore, the total number of hours Edgar can work in a week is 120 hours / 8 hours per day = 15 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, Edgar can work for 15 days + 7 days (off) = 22 days in a week.
"Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and each hour has 60 minutes. So, we can calculate the number of minutes in a day as follows:

Minutes in a day = Hours in a day x Minutes per hour
= 24 x 60
= 1440 minutes

Now, let's find out how many dogs Edith has. According to the question, Edith has 27 dogs. Since each dog has 365 days in a year (assuming they live for one year), we can calculate the total number of days Edith's dogs have as follows:

Total days of Edith's dogs = Number of dogs x Days per dog
= 27 x 365
= 9,825 days

Finally, we need to convert the number of days into minutes. There are 1440 minutes in an hour, so we can calculate the total number of minutes Edith's dogs have as follows:

Total minutes of Edith's dogs = Total days of Edith's dogs x Minutes per day
= 9,825 days x 1440 minutes/day
= 14,304,000 minutes

Therefore, the answer is 14,304,000 minutes."
Response:  We know that there are 29 days in March and April combined (since they have 30 days each). So, if we subtract 17 days from 29 days, we get 12 days left. Therefore, the number of days Edugu is away from home is 12 days.

So, we need to subtract these two dates to get the number of days.  August 15th - September 1st = 16 days. Therefore, there are 16 days between August 15th and September 1st.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between two dates.  The first date is August 15th and the second date is September 1st.  So, we need to subtract these two dates to get the number of days.  August 15th - September 1st = 16 days. Therefore, there are 16 days between these two dates.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 408 students in the class has studied for at least one hour during their summer vacation.  Since there are 408 students in total, and they studied for at least one hour each, we can say that each student studied for at most 408 hours (i.e., 1 hour per day x 408 days).  Now, let's calculate the number of students who studied for more than 408 hours:  Out of the remaining 408 - 408 = 0 hours, none of the students studied for more than 408 hours. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 1 appears in the remaining 166 digits of the pi number after removing the first 100 digits.  To do this, we will divide the remaining 166 digits into groups of 10 each and count the number of times the digit 1 appears in each group.  For example, if we take the first group of 10 digits (from position 101 to position 110), then the digit 1 appears once in that group, i.e., at position 103. Similarly, if we take the second group of 10 digits (from position 111 to position 120), then the digit 1 appears twice in that group, i.e., at positions 114 and 119. Therefore, the total number of times the digit 1 appears in the remaining 166 digits of pi is 1 + 2 +... + x = 166, where x is the total number of appearances of the digit 1 in all the groups. Since there are 10 groups, the value of x is 166 / 10 = 16. So, the answer is 16.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 10 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 324, 374, 128, 256, 192, 224, 160, 128, 100, 80, 64, 48, 32, and 20.  Since there are ten digits in total, we can conclude that each digit appears exactly ten times in the sequence. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each digit (0-9) appears in the number 257 and then calculate the average of those digits.  The number 257 can be written as follows: 2 x 53 = 106 + 53 = 159. So, there are two 2's, three 5's, and four 3's in the number 257. Now, let's count how many times each digit appears:  Number of appearances of each digit:  Digit 0: 4 appearances (twice in 2 and twice in 53).  Digit 1: 2 appearances (in both 2 and 53).  Digit 2: 2 appearances (in both 2 and 53).  Digit 3: 4 appearances (thrice in 53).  Digit 4: 1 appearance (in 257 itself).  Digit 5: 3 appearances (thrice in 53).  Digit 6: 0 appearance (none in 257).  Digit 7: 0 appearance (none in 257).  Digit 8: 0 appearance (none in 257).  Digit 9: 1 appearance (in 53). Therefore, we can say that the most common digit in the number 257 is 3, which appears 4 times, followed by 5, which appears 3 times.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each digit (0-9) appears in the number 14445321879.  The digits are: 0 - 9. So, we can count them as follows: 0 - 1 time, 1 - 1 time, 2 - 2 times, 3 - 3 times, 4 - 4 times, 5 - 5 times, 6 - 6 times, 7 - 7 times, 8 - 8 times, and 9 - 9 times. Therefore, there are 9 digits in total. Now, let's calculate the sum of these digits: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 55. So, the sum of the digits in the number 14445321879 is 55.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 30 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 228, 337, 456, 575, 694,... (upto 30).  To do this, we can use a simple formula: Number of appearances = Total number of terms / Number of digits in the term.  In this case, the total number of terms is 30, and the number of digits in each term is either 2 or 3 (depending on whether it is an even or odd number). So, we can calculate the number of appearances as follows: Number of appearances = 30 / 2 = 15  Therefore, there are 15 times when each number from 1 to 30 appears in the given sequence of numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 450 appears in the list of 66 names.  Since there are 66 names, we can divide them into groups of 66/2 = 33 pairs.  Each pair consists of two names, and since there are 450 names in total, each name must appear exactly once in every pair. Therefore, the number of times each number from 1 to 450 appears in the list is equal to the number of pairs it appears in.  So, let's count the number of pairs for each number:  For number 1, there is only one pair (the first two names), so it appears once in that pair.  For number 2, there are 33 pairs, and it appears in the second pair.  For number 3, there are 32 pairs left, and it appears in the third pair.  And so on...  In conclusion, the number of times each number from 1 to 450 appears in the list of 66 names is as follows:  1 - 1 2 - 33 3 - 32... 450 - 1
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 218 appears in the list of 351 words.  To do this, we need to count the number of times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the list of words.  For example, if there are 7 words that start with the digit 4, then we can say that the digit 4 appears 7 times in the list of words.  Similarly, if there are 3 words that end with the digit 1, then we can say that the digit 1 appears 3 times in the list of words.  Now, let's count the number of times each digit appears in the list of 351 words:  Digit 0 appears 6 times (e.g., zero, hundred, thousand).  Digit 1 appears 13 times (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine).  Digit 2 appears 10 times (e.g., two, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety).  Digit 3 appears 7 times (e.g., three, thirty-one, forty-one, fifty-one, sixty-one, seventy-one).  Digit 4 appears 7 times (e.g., four, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty).  Digit 5 appears 6 times (e.g., five, fifty, sixty, seventy-five, hundred).  Digit 6 appears 5 times (e.g., six, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety).  Digit 7 appears 4 times (e.g., seven, seventy, eighty, ninety).  Digit 8 appears 3 times (e.g., eight, eighty, ninety).  Digit 9 appears 3 times (e.g., nine, ninety, hundred).  Therefore, the total number of digits that appear in the list of 351 words is 6 + 13 + 10 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 6 = 65.  Since there are 218 words in the list, the number of times the digit

Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are red. So, let's start with finding out the total number of balls. According to the question, there are 569 balls in all and 236 of them are blue. Therefore, the total number of balls is 569 + 236 = 805. Now, we need to find out what percentage of these balls are red. To do this, we divide the number of red balls (236) by the total number of balls (805), which gives us 0.287 or approximately 28.7%.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are red. So, let's start with finding out the total number of balls. From the question, we know that there are 34 small balls and 841 medium-sized balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is: 34 + 841 = 875 balls. Now, we need to find out how many of these balls are red. The question tells us that among these balls, 20% are red. To find out what percentage of red balls is, we can multiply the number of red balls by 100: (20/100) x 875 = 175 red balls. So, the percentage of red balls is 175/875 x 100 = 20%.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  The set consists of 485 numbers and we need to find out how many pairs of numbers are there among them.  To do this, we can use the following approach:  Firstly, let us list all the numbers from 1 to 485: 1, 2, 3,..., 485. Now, let us find out how many pairs of numbers are there among these numbers:  A pair of numbers means two numbers that add up to make 485. For example, 1 + 484 = 485, so (1, 484) is one pair of numbers. Similarly, (2, 483), (3, 482),..., (484, 1) are also pairs of numbers. Therefore, the number of pairs of numbers among the given set of numbers is: 485 - 1 = 484 pairs of numbers. So, there are 484 pairs of numbers in the given set of numbers.

So, the answer is 98,800 bags of rice."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the given numbers.  The first number is 706, which contains the digits 7 and 6 twice each. Therefore, we need to count these two digits separately. So, the total number of occurrences of the digit 7 is 2 x 7 = 14, and the total number of occurrences of the digit 6 is also 2 x 6 = 12. Now, let's move on to the second number, which is 222. This number contains only one occurrence of the digit 2, so its total number of occurrences is just 1. Similarly, for the third number, there are no occurrences of the digit 3, so its total number of occurrences is also 0. Moving on to the fourth number, which is 418, this number contains two occurrences of the digit 4 and one occurrence of the digit 1, so its total number of occurrences is 2 + 1 = 3. Finally, for the fifth number, which is 1000, this number contains four occurrences of the digit 0 and five occurrences of the digit 1, so its total number of occurrences is 4 + 5 = 9. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in the given numbers is as follows: Digit    Occurrences  7     14    6     12    2     0     1     3     5   Total  14+12+2+0+1+3+5=41  Thus, there are 41 distinct digits among the given numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are red. So, let's start with finding the total number of balls. From the given information, we know that there are 902 balls in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them are red. The ratio of red balls to total balls is 811/902 = 0.89 or approximately 89%. Therefore, the percentage of red balls among all balls is (89% / 100%) x 100 = 89%.
Response:  We know that there are 632 balls in total and 410 of them are red. So, the number of blue balls is 632 - 410 = 222. Therefore, there are 222 blue balls in the basket.
"Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are red. So, let's start with finding the total number of balls. From the given information, we know that there are 732 blue balls, 761 green balls, and 682 yellow balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is:

Total Number of Balls = Blue Balls + Green Balls + Yellow Balls
= 732 + 761 + 682
= 2175

Now, we need to find out what percentage of these balls are red. To do this, we divide the number of red balls (8) by the total number of balls (2175):

Percentage of Red Balls = Number of Red Balls / Total Number of Balls
= 8 / 2175
= 0.036

So, approximately 3.6% of the balls in the basket are red."
Response:  We have to find out how many balls are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are red. So, let's start with finding the total number of balls. From the question, we know that there are 496 blue balls and 910 green balls. Therefore, the total number of balls is: 496 + 910 = 1406 balls. Now, we need to find out how many red balls are there among these balls. The question states that there are 135 red balls. So, the percentage of red balls among all balls is: (135/1406) x 100% = 9.5%.
Response:  We know that there are 308 balls in total and we have to find out how many of them are red. So, the number of red balls is 308/2 = 154. Now, we need to find out how many of these 154 red balls are odd numbers. To do this, we divide 154 by 2 = 77. Therefore, among the 154 red balls, 77 are odd numbers. Similarly, we can find out the number of even numbers among the remaining 154 balls by dividing 154 by 2 = 77. Among these 77 even balls, 39 are odd numbers. So, the final answer is 77 + 39 = 116 balls.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given list such that their difference is equal to 772.  To do this, we can use the following approach:  For each number in the list, find its nearest neighbor (i.e., the number immediately before or after it) and check if their difference is equal to 772. If yes, then mark that pair as a solution. Otherwise, move to the next number in the list and repeat the process until all the numbers have been checked.  After checking all the numbers, we will have found exactly 772 pairs of numbers in the list whose difference is equal to 772. Therefore, the answer is 772.

Response:  We have to find out how many dollars are there in 18 edwards. So, we need to divide the number of edwards by the cost per edward. Cost per edward is given as $16. Therefore, Number of dollars = Number of Edwars x Cost per Edward = 18 x $16 = $274.
"Response:  We have to find out how many days Edgar has worked for $3 each day. So, we need to divide $3 by $0.5 (the cost per hour) to get the number of hours worked. Then, we multiply this number by 60 (to convert minutes to hours) to get the total number of minutes worked. Finally, we divide this number by 60 (again to convert back to minutes) to get the final answer in minutes. Here is the calculation:
$3 / $0.5 = 6 hours worked
6 hours x 60 = 360 minutes worked
360 minutes / 60 = 6 minutes worked per day
Therefore, Edgar worked for 6 minutes per day at $3 per minute."
Response:  We know that there are 9 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is 9 x 24 = 216 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Edgar worked in those 9 days. According to the question, he worked for 8 hours a day, so he worked for 8 x 9 = 72 hours in total. Therefore, the answer is 216 - 72 = 144 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many times $ 16 can be divided into $ 6.  To do this, we need to divide $ 16 by $ 6.  When we divide $ 16 by $ 6, we get $ 2 with remainder $ 4. So, $ 16 can be divided into $ 6 exactly 2 times with a remaining amount of $ 4. Therefore, the answer is $ 2 x 6 = 12.
Response:  We have to find out how many times $6 can be divided into $12 without leaving any remainder.  To do this, we need to divide $12 by $6 and see if there is any remainder left.  So, $12 / $6 = 2 with no remainder. Therefore, $6 can be divided into $12 exactly 2 times.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times $6 can be divided into $16 and get a remainder of $19.  So, we need to divide $16 by $6 and see if there is any remainder left.

Number of times $6 can be divided into $16 = Number of times $16 can be divided into $19 - 1 = 18

So, the answer is 18."
Response:  We have to find out how many times $4$ can be divided into $12$.  So, we need to divide $12$ by $4$, which gives us $\boxed{3}$. Therefore, there are $3$ groups of $4$ that add up to $12$.
Response:  We have to find out how many dollars are there in total and then divide it by 16 to get the average price per dollar. So, let's calculate the total amount of money first:  $ 19 x 16 = $ 276 Now, we need to divide the total amount by 8 to get the average price per dollar:  $ 276 / 8 = $ 34.50 Therefore, the average price per dollar is $ 34.50.
Response:  We have to find out how much money Edgar has after he spends $ 10 and then we need to subtract $ 7 from that amount. So, let's calculate it as follows:  Firstly, Edgar had $ 100 (as mentioned in the question). Then, he spent $ 10, so his new balance became $ 90 ($ 100 - $ 10). Next, he spent another $ 7, so his new balance became $ 83 ($ 90 - $ 7). Therefore, the final amount of money Edgar has is $ 83.
Response:  We know that 44 puffs are consumed in one day and 58 e-cigarettes are available in total. So, we can calculate the number of puffs consumed per e-cigarette as follows: Number of puffs consumed = Total number of puffs / Total number of e-cigarettes Available for consumption = 44 / 58 = 0.76 or approximately 1/1.33 Therefore, on average, 1 e-cigarette contains around 1/1.33 puffs.
Response:  We know that 51 - 44 = 7. So, there are 7 puffs left in the pack after consuming 44 puffs.
Response:  We know that Devid has to do 44 push-ups in total.  He has already done 9 push-ups so far. So, he still needs to do 35 more push-ups.
Response:  We know that there are 51 pups in the litter and we want to find out how many of them are male or female. So, let's assume that each pup has an equal chance of being male or female, which means that the probability of a pup being male is also 0.51 (since there are 51 pups). Now, we need to calculate the number of male pups. Since there are 49 females among the 51 pups, the number of males must be 51 - 49 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 male pups in the litter.
Response:  We know that there are 59 puffs in one pack of cigarettes and each pack contains 20 cigarettes. So, the total number of cigarettes in one pack is 59 x 20 = 1180 cigarettes. Now, we know that Devid smokes for 19 years and he smokes 44 cigarettes per day on an average. Therefore, the total number of cigarettes smoked by Devid is 1180 x 19 = 21760 cigarettes.
Response:  We know that 44 puffs - 17 crackers = 27. So, if we do 27 crunches for each of the 13 takkus, it will be equal to 351 crunches in total. Therefore, the answer is 351.
Response:  We know that there are 53 puffs in one box of Puffcorn and we need to do 14 crunches for each box. So, total number of crunches needed = Number of boxes x Number of crunches per box = 53 x 14 = 752 crunches. Now, let's calculate how many crunches Zachary needs to do based on his age. According to the question, Zachary is 10 years old, which means he can do half of the total number of crunches required (i.e., 752 / 2 = 376). Therefore, Zachary needs to do 376 crunches.
Response:  We know that Jachary can do 58 push-ups in 1 minute.  Now we need to find out how many push-ups he can do in 3 minutes and 40 seconds (which is equal to 2.5 times of 1 minute). So, let's multiply 58 with 2.5 = 147 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary can do 147 push-ups in 3 minutes and 40 seconds.
Response:  We know that Jachary can do 38 push-ups in 1 minute.  Now we need to find out how many push-ups he can do in 60 seconds.  To do this, we divide the number of push-ups he can do in 1 minute (38) by 60. So, Zachary can do 620 push-ups in 1 minute.
Response:  We know that there are 19 pups in each litter and Devid has 39 litters. So, the total number of pups is: 19 x 39 = 701. Now, we need to find out how many pups Devi has. Since Devi has 13 litters, the total number of pups she has is: 13 x 19 = 247. Therefore, the answer is 701 - 247 = 454 pups.
Response:  We know that there are 51 pups in the litter and Devid has already taken 22 of them. So, the number of pups left with Janardhan is 51 - 22 = 29. Now, out of these 29 pups, Devid has taken 4, so the number of pups left with Janardhan is 29 - 4 = 25. Therefore, the final answer is 25.
Response:  We know that there are 15 pups in each litter and Devid has 39 litters. So, the total number of pups is: 39 x 15 = 585 pups. Now, we need to find out how many pups Janet has. From the question, we know that Janet has 9 litters, so the total number of pups she has is: 9 x 15 = 135 pups. Therefore, the difference between the number of pups Devid and Janet have is: 585 - 135 = 450 pups.
Response:  If Devid did 30 push-ups in one minute, then he did 60 push-ups in two minutes (since there are 2 minutes). Similarly, if he did 60 push-ups in two minutes, then he did 120 push-ups in four minutes (since there are 4 minutes). Therefore, Devid did 120 push-ups in four minutes.
Response:  We know that Devid has 56 eggs and he wants to distribute them equally among his 38 friends. So, each friend will get 1 egg per person. Therefore, the answer is 1 egg per friend.
Response:  We know that Devid has 40 marbles in total and he wants to divide them equally among his friends so that each friend gets an equal number of marbles.  Since there are 17 jars available, we can divide the marbles into 17 groups or batches.  Each group will contain 40/17 = 2.35 marbles per jar. So, if Devid divides the marbles equally among his 6 friends, each friend will get 2.35 marbles from each jar. Therefore, the total number of marbles each friend will get is (2.35 x 6) = 13.3 marbles per friend. Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Devid will have after giving all the marbles to his friends. He had 40 marbles initially, which means he will have 40 - (13.3 x 6) = 8.7 marbles left with him after giving all the marbles to his friends.
Response:  We know that Devon has 36 marbles and he gives 12 to Zachary. So, Devon has 36 - 12 = 24 marbles left. Now, we are asked how many marbles Zachary has after receiving 12 marbles from Devon. Therefore, Zachary has 0 + 12 = 12 marbles.
Response:  We know that Devon has 7 takuvi (crunches) and he wants to do 17 crunches in total. So, we need to find out how many times Devon can repeat his current number of crunches to reach his target.  To do this, we divide the total number of crunches he wants to do (17) by the number of crunches he currently does (7): 17 / 7 = 2.43  Therefore, Devon needs to repeat his current number of crunches (7) approximately 2.43 times to reach his target of doing 17 crunches in total.

"Response:  We know that there are 9 pensioners in total and each of them has to be paid Rs. 900 per month as their pension. So, the total amount of money required to pay these pensioners is:
Rs. 900 x 9 = Rs. 8100 per month.
Now, we have to calculate how much money will be left after paying all the pensioners. To do this, we need to subtract the total amount of money required to pay the pensioners from the total amount of money available for distribution among the 9 pensioners.
So, let's calculate the difference between the two amounts:
Rs. 8100 - Rs. 7530 = Rs. 570.
Therefore, after paying all the pensioners, there will be Rs. 570 left over."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number appears in the given set of numbers.  The first number is 11, which appears only once in the set.  The second number is 2, which appears twice in the set (once as 2 and once as 20).  The third number is 3, which appears thrice in the set (once as 3, once as 30, and once as 300).  Therefore, the total number of appearances of each number in the given set of numbers is:  11 - 1 = 10 2 - 2 = 0 3 - 3 = 0 So, there are 10 instances of the number 11, 0 instances of the number 2, and 0 instances of the number 3 in the given set of numbers.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to calculate how many hours are spent on watching TV per day. According to the question, an average person spends 3-4 hours per day watching TV. Therefore, the total number of hours spent on watching TV in a week is 3-4 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21-28 hours/week.
"Response:  We know that there are 9 planets in our solar system and each planet has its own unique features.  So, if we want to find out which planet is similar to Earth in terms of size, temperature range, atmosphere, etc., we need to compare them with Earth.  Here are some key factors to consider:

Size: Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers (km). The other planets in our solar system are much smaller than Earth, with Mars being the closest at around 6,794 km in diameter. Therefore, based on size alone, Earth is not similar to any of the other planets in our solar system.

Temperature Range: Earth's average temperature ranges from -89 degrees Celsius (-129°F) at the poles to 57 degrees Celsius (135°F) near the equator. While Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 462°C (863°F), Mercury is the coldest, with an average temperature of -173°C (-279°F). Again, Earth is unique among the planets in our solar system due to its moderate climate.

Atmosphere: Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and neon. Other planets have different atmospheric compositions, with Mars having a thin atmosphere mostly made up of carbon dioxide, while Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium. Once again, Earth stands out for its breathable atmosphere.

Moons: Earth has one moon, known as Luna or the Moon, which is relatively small compared to other moons in our solar system. For example, Jupiter has dozens of moons, including Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto, all larger than Earth's Moon.

Conclusion: Based on these comparisons, it appears that Earth is unique among the planets in our solar system. While some of the other planets may share certain characteristics with Earth, none match it perfectly across multiple categories."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number appears in the given sequence of numbers: 8, 5, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 9, 7, 8.  Firstly, we can see that the number 8 appears twice in the sequence, so it contributes 2 units to the total count. Similarly, the number 5 appears once, and the number 2 appears thrice, contributing 2 + 6 = 8 units to the total count. The number 4 appears only once, contributing 1 unit to the total count. The number 1 appears twice, contributing 2 units to the total count. The number 6 appears once, contributing 1 unit to the total count. Finally, the number 3 appears twice, contributing 2 units to the total count. Therefore, the total count is: 2 + 8 + 6 + 1 + 2 = 19 units. So, there are 19 numbers in the sequence.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number appears in the given set of numbers and then multiply it with its corresponding power.  Here are the numbers in the set: 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  Now let's count how many times each number appears:  Number of appearances: 5 - 2, 7 - 2, 8 - 1, 9 - 2, 10 - 1, 12 - 1, 13 - 1, 14 - 1, 15 - 1, 16 - 1, 17 - 1, 18 - 1, 19 - 1, 20 - 1.  So, we need to multiply these counts with their respective powers:  Power of 5 = 2^2 = 4, Power of 7 = 2^3 = 8, Power of 8 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 9 = 2^1 = 2, Power of 10 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 12 = 2^1 = 2, Power of 13 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 14 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 15 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 16 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 17 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 18 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 19 = 2^0 = 1, Power of 20 = 2^0 = 1.  Therefore, the total product is: 4 x 8 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 = 1680.  So, there are 1680 ways to arrange the digits from 1 to 20 without repeating any digit.

Response:  We know that Jack has 6 eyes and Madhavi has 8 eyes. So, if we want to find out how many times Jack can see Madhavi, we need to divide the number of eyes of Madhavi by the number of eyes of Jack.  Therefore, the answer is:  Madhavi can be seen by Jack 8/6 = 13 times.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 elements in the universe (earth, water, fire, and air). Each element has its own unique properties and characteristics. Now, let's consider each of these elements and their corresponding numbers:

1. Earth - The number associated with earth is 3. This is because earth represents stability, structure, and growth.
2. Water - The number associated with water is 5. This is because water represents change, adaptability, and flow.
3. Fire - The number associated with fire is 7. This is because fire represents transformation, energy, and passion.
4. Air - The number associated with air is 6. This is because air represents balance, harmony, and communication.

Now, let's calculate the sum of these numbers to find out how many elements are present in the universe:

3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 29

So, there are 29 elements in the universe according to this calculation. However, it's important to note that this is just one way of understanding the elements based on their numerical associations, and other systems may have different interpretations."

= 1000 kg / 2 angulas/guddulu
= 500 guddulus
Therefore, it takes approximately 500 guddulus to make 1 kg of Gandham."
Response:  We know that there are 35 angulas in one gandham. So, if we take 4 angulas from each of the 4 Gandham, then we will have taken 4 x 4 = 16 angulas altogether. Therefore, the number of angulas left after taking 4 angulas from each of the 4 Gandham is 35 - 16 = 19 angulas.
Response:  We know that there are 19 angulas in each gandham and we have to find out how many gandhams are required for 44 units of karpam. So, we can divide 44 by 19 to get the number of gandhams required. Therefore, the answer is 2.35 gandhams are required for 44 units of karpam.
Response:  We know that there are 39 angulas in each gandham and 19 angulas in each karpam. So, we can calculate the number of karpams required to make one gandham as follows: Number of karpams = Total number of angulas / Number of angulas in one karpam = 39 / 19 = 2 Therefore, we need 2 karpams to make one gandham. Now, let's find out how many karpams are required to make 12 gandhams. Number of karpams for 12 gandhams = Total number of angulas / Number of angulas in one karpam = 46 (from previous calculation) / 19 = 2.47 rounded off to 2 karpams. So, we require approximately 2 karpams to make 12 gandhams.
"Response:  We know that Gudipudi is made up of rice and lentils. So, we can calculate the weight of Gudipudi as follows:

Response:  We have to find out how many times 85 is divisible by 37 and also how many times 37 is divisible by 85.  So, we need to perform two calculations separately.  Firstly, let us calculate how many times 85 is divisible by 37.  We know that 85 / 37 = 2 with remainder 16.  Therefore, 85 is divisible by 37 exactly 2 times.  Now, let us move on to calculating how many times 37 is divisible by 85.  We know that 37 / 85 = 0 with remainder 42.  Therefore, 37 is divisible by 85 exactly 42 times.  Since both calculations are completed successfully, we can conclude that there are 2 x 42 = 84 pairs of numbers that satisfy the given condition.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 8 paisa coins can be combined to make 1 rupee.  To do this, we need to divide 80 (the total number of paisa coins) by 8 (the number of paisa coins in one rupee). So, we get: 80 / 8 = 10. Therefore, 8 paisa coins can be combined to make 1 rupee 10 times.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 38 and 47 appear in the given text.  To do this, we need to count the number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in the text.  For example, if there are 5 digits in the text, then we can say that the number of occurrences of each digit is 5/10 = 0.5.  Similarly, if there are 10 digits in the text, then we can say that the number of occurrences of each digit is 10/10 = 1.  Now let's apply this logic to our problem.  The given text has 94 words, so we can assume that it contains approximately 94/10 = 9.4 digits (words).  Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, we can estimate that each word contains approximately 94/26 = 3.6 letters per word.  Therefore, the total number of letters in the text is approximately 94 x 3.6 = 336.8 letters.  Next, we need to calculate the number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in the text.  There are 10 digits in total, so we can say that the number of occurrences of each digit is 336.8 / 10 = 33.68.  Now we need to find out how many times 38 and 47 appear in the text.  We know that 38 appears exactly once in the text, because it is the number of words in the first sentence.  Therefore, the number of occurrences of 38 is 1.  As for 47, we can see that it appears twice in the text, because it is the number of words in both the second and third sentences.  Therefore, the number of occurrences of 47 is 2.  So, to summarize, the number of times 38 appears in the text is 1, and the number of times 47 appears is 2.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 18 and 38 are divisible by 5.  So, we need to divide both numbers by 5 and see if they leave any remainder.  When we divide 18 by 5, we get 3 with a remainder of 3.  Similarly, when we divide 38 by 5, we also get 7 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, there are 3 instances where 18 is divisible by 5 (3 x 3 = 9), and there are 4 instances where 38 is divisible by 5 (4 x 4 = 16).  So, in total, there are 9 + 16 = 25 instances where either 18 or 38 is divisible by 5.
Response:  We know that there are 87 paksis in one dhurva grass. So, if we have to count how many paksis are there in 18 kothas of dhurva grass, we need to divide 87 by 18, which gives us approximately 5. So, there are around 5 paksis in each kotha of dhurva grass.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 49 appears in the list of 59 numbers.  To do this, we can use a simple formula: Number of appearances = Total number of numbers / Number of unique numbers. In this case, the total number of numbers is 59, and there are 49 distinct numbers (since each number appears only once). So, we divide 59 by 49 to get the number of appearances for each number:  Number of appearances = 59 / 49 = 1.2  Therefore, each number from 1 to 49 appears approximately 1.2 times in the list of 59 numbers.

Response:  We have to find out how many times 45 is divisible by 86.  To do this, we need to divide 45 by 86 and see if there are any remainders.  If there are no remainders, then 45 is divisible by 86 exactly once.  So, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 41 and 62 are divisible by each other.  So, we need to divide both numbers by their common factors.  The least common multiple of 41 and 62 is 840. Therefore, we can say that 41 and 62 are divisible by each other exactly 8 times (i.e., 840 / 41 = 840 / 62 = 13).  So, there are 13 pairs of multiples of 41 and 62 that are equal.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 20 appears in the given series.  The series consists of 30 terms, and each term is a combination of two digits. Therefore, we need to count the number of times each digit (0-9) appears in the series.  Since there are 10 digits in total (0-9), each digit will appear 3 times in the series (since there are 30 terms). So, the answer is:  Number of times each digit appears in the series = 10 digits x 3 appearances per digit = 30 appearances Total appearances of each digit in the series = 30  Therefore, the answer is 30.

Response:  We know that the number of pallets is 551 and the number of boxes per pallet is 177. So, we need to calculate how many boxes are there in total.  Therefore, the answer is: Total number of boxes = Number of pallets x Number of boxes per pallet = 551 x 177 = 94,367 boxes.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 440 is divisible by 111 and 106.  To do this, we need to divide both numbers by 440.  So, 111 / 440 = 2.57 (round down to 2) and 106 / 440 = 2.39 (round down to 2).  Now, we see that 2 is the least common multiple of 111 and 106 with 440. Therefore, there are 2 x 111 = 222 pairs of multiples between 440 and 111, and 2 x 106 = 212 pairs of multiples between 440 and 106.  So, in total, there are 222 + 212 = 434 pairs of multiples between 440 and these two numbers.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 65 is divisible by 7 in a range of 100-200.  So, we need to divide 65 by 7 for different values of x between 100 and 200.

Response:  We know that there are 110 puppets in total and each puppet has 90 strings attached to it. So, we have a total of 9900 strings (110 x 90). Now, if we want to calculate how many times each string is used, we need to divide the number of strings by the number of puppets. So, the number of times each string is used is:  Number of strings / Number of puppets = 9900 / 110 = 89.09 times per string. Therefore, each string is used approximately 89.09 times.

Therefore, the answer is 6094.87 pukka roads in Andhra Pradesh."
Response:  We have to find out how many times 52 weeks are present in a year.  There are 12 months in a year. So, we can say that there are 52 weeks in 12 months. Now, let's calculate the total number of days in a year. As there are 7 days in a week, we can say that there are 52 x 7 = 364 days in a year. But wait! We haven't considered leap years yet. In a leap year, there are 366 days instead of 364 days. So, if we want to include both non-leap and leap years, we need to multiply the total number of days by 2. Therefore, the final answer is 364 x 2 = 728 days in a year.

Response:  We have to find out how many times 8 is divisible by 3 in a given range of numbers.  So, we need to divide the given range of numbers into groups of 8 and count the number of times each group is divisible by 3.  For example, if the given range of numbers is 100-200, then we can divide it into two groups of 8 as follows:  Group 1: 100-80 = 20 (divisible by 3 twice) Group 2: 81-200 = 40 (divisible by 3 once) Therefore, there are 20 instances where 8 is divisible by 3 in the given range of numbers.  Now, let's consider the next range of numbers, say 200-300.  We can divide it into three groups of 8 as follows:  Group 1: 200-160 = 40 (divisible by 3 twice) Group 2: 161-240 = 80 (divisible by 3 thrice) Group 3: 241-300 = 60 (divisible by 3 once) Therefore, there are 40 + 80 + 60 = 180 instances where 8 is divisible by 3 in the given range of numbers.  In general, for any range of numbers n-m, where n and m are positive integers, we can use the same method to find the number of instances where 8 is divisible by 3.  That is, we can divide the range into groups of 8 and count the number of times each group is divisible by 3.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 180.

6 / 3 = 2 (divisible twice)
7 / 3 = 3 (divisible thrice)
8 / 3 = 3 (divisible thrice)
9 / 3 = 4 (divisible four times)
10 / 3 = 4 (divisible four times)

Therefore, there are 10 numbers that are divisible by 3 when divided by 12."

From the given information, we know that Danie was born on March 22nd and her sister was born on May 7th. So, the difference between their birthdays is 49 days (May 7th - March 22nd). Therefore, the answer is 49.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between Daniee and her 30th birthday.  As per the question, she was born in 1992, which means she is currently 30 years old. So, from 1992 to 2022 (her current year), she has already lived for 30 years. Therefore, there are 30 years between Daniee and her 30th birthday. Now, we need to calculate how many days are there in 30 years. There are 365 days in a year, so there are 365 x 30 = 10,950 days between Daniee and her 30th birthday.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes Danie can buy with $100.  Since there are 11 different types of shoes available at the store and each type has 7 sizes, we need to calculate the total number of possible combinations.  There are 28 pairs of shoes in total (including duplicates). So, if Danie buys only one pair of shoes from each type, he will be able to buy 68 pairs of shoes (since each pair costs $10). However, since he wants to buy multiple pairs, let's assume that he will buy 51 pairs of shoes (which is the maximum number of pairs he can afford based on his budget). Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Danie can buy with $100 is:  Number of pairs = Total number of possible combinations x Maximum number of pairs he can afford $100 / Price per pair = 68 x 51 $100 / $20 = 5 pairs of shoes

100 / 5 = 20

So, there are 20 pairs of shoes that can be made from 100 pieces of leather."
Response:  We know that Danie has 82 pencils and wants to share them equally among 42 students in her class. So, each student will get $\frac{82}{42} = 2$ pencils. Now, we have to find out how many pencils each of the remaining 61 students will get. Since Danie has $ \frac{82}{42} = 2$ pencils left after sharing with the first 42 students, she will have $\frac{82 - 2}{61} = 0.1357$ pencils per student left. Therefore, each of the remaining 61 students will get $\boxed{13}$ pencils.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes Dan can buy with his $600.  Firstly, we need to convert the amount of money from dollars to rupees.  There are approximately 75 rupees for one dollar, so:

$600 x 75 = ₹45,000 (approximately)

Now, we know that Dan wants to buy 66 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs ₹39. So, he needs:

66 pairs x ₹39 per pair = ₹2,604 (approximately)

Therefore, Dan can buy ₹2,604 worth of shoes with his $600."
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes Danie can buy with $50.  Since there are 46 pairs of shoes in total and Danie has $50, we can calculate the maximum number of pairs of shoes he can buy as follows:  Number of pairs of shoes = Total amount available for buying shoes / Price of each pair of shoes = $50 / $13 (price of one pair of shoes) = 3.85 pairs of shoes (round off to nearest whole number) So, Danie can buy approximately 4 pairs of shoes with his $50.
Response:  We know that Danie has 65 pencils and wants to share them equally among 5 of her friends. So, each friend will get 13 pencils (65/5 = 13). Now, we need to find out how many pencils each of the remaining 4 friends will get. Since there are 9 pencils left after Danie shared with her 5 friends, each of the remaining 4 friends will get 2 pencils (9/4 = 2). Therefore, the final answer is: 13 + 2 = 15 pencils.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of shoes can be made from 58 pieces of leather and 25 yards of fabric.  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of shoes that can be made with each piece of leather. Since there are 58 pieces of leather, we can make 58 / 4 = 14.5 shoes per piece of leather (since you cannot make half a shoe). Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes that can be made using all 58 pieces of leather: 14.5 x 58 = 83.5 shoes. Next, we need to calculate the number of shoes that can be made with each yard of fabric. Since there are 25 yards of fabric, we can make 25 / 4 = 6.25 shoes per yard of fabric (again, since you cannot make half a shoe). So, the total number of shoes that can be made using all 25 yards of fabric is: 6.25 x 25 = 156 shoes. Therefore, in total, we can make 83.5 + 156 = 239.5 shoes.
"Response:  We have to find out how many packets of chips are there in total and then divide it by 4 to get the number of packets per day.  So, let's calculate the total number of packets first.  From the question, we know that there are 15 seeds in each packet and 18 packets in total. Therefore, the total number of seeds is:

15 x 18 = 270

Now, we need to convert this number into packets. Since there are 4 seeds in each packet, we can divide the total number of seeds by 4 to get the number of packets:

270 / 4 = 67.5

So, there are approximately 67.5 packets of chips in total. Now, we need to find out how many packets are there per day. To do this, we will divide the total number of packets by the number of days (which is 15). Therefore, the number of packets per day is:

67.5 / 15 = 4.5

So, there are approximately 4.5 packets of chips per day."

Response:  We know that Jack has 12 apples and he wants to share them equally among his friends. So, each friend will get 1 apple per person. Now, we need to find out how many apples Jack can give to each of his 11 friends. To do this, we divide the total number of apples (12) by the number of friends (11). Therefore, Jack can give 1 apple per friend, which means he can give 11 apples in total. But wait! There is one more friend, Steve, who also wants an apple from Jack. So, Jack needs to give 1 apple to Steve as well, making the total number of apples he gives to his friends 12.
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 tails and 9 heads. So, the total number of tails is 7 + 9 = 16. Now, we need to find out how many times each tail appears in the deck. Since there are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards, we can divide the total number of tails (16) by 52 to get the average number of tails per card. Therefore, the answer is 16 / 52 = 0.3077.
Response:  We know that Jack has 7 tails and 8 legs. So, he has a total of 7 + 8 = 15 body parts. Now, we are asked how many legs Steve has. Since Steve is a dog, he has 4 legs. Therefore, the answer is 15 (Jack's body parts) - 4 (Steve's legs) = 11.
Response:  We know that Jack has 9 tails and Steve has 16 paws. So, if we want to find out how many paws Steve has, we need to divide the number of tails Jack has by the number of paws Steve has.  Therefore, the answer is:  Steve has 16/9 = 1.77 paws.
Response:  We know that Jack has 6 tails and Stevie has 18 legs. So, if we divide the number of legs of Stevie by the number of tails of Jack, we get  $\frac {18}{6} = 3$. Therefore, there are $3$ legs for each tail of Jack.
Response:  We know that Jack has 5 pencils and he wants to share them equally among his friends. So, we need to divide 5 pencils into 8 groups of equal size. Since each group should have 1 pencil, we will have 8 groups or partitions of pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils each friend gets is 8 x 1 = 8.
Response:  We know that Jack has 16 tails and Stevie has 15 marbles. So, if we give one tail to each of Stevie's marbles, how many tails will Jack have left? Well, since Stevie has 15 marbles, and each marble requires 4 tails (since there are 4 sides to each marble), then Stevie needs 60 tails in total (15 marbles x 4 tails per marble). Now, since Jack has 16 tails initially, he can give 16 - 60 = -44 tails to Stevie. Therefore, after giving all his tails to Stevie, Jack will be left with -44 tails.
Response:  We know that Jack is 12 years old and has 79 steves in his piggy bank. Each Steve is worth $1. So, we can calculate the total amount of money in Jack's piggy bank as follows: Number of Steves = 79 x Price per Steve = $1 Total Amount of Money = Number of Steves x Price per Steve = $79 Therefore, the total amount of money in Jack's piggy bank is $79.
Response:  We have to find out how many apples Jack has after he gives 3 apples to Steve and then takes back 2 apples from him. So, initially, Jack had 13 apples (Question 1). After giving 3 apples to Steve, Jack has 10 apples left (Question 2). Then, Steve gave 8 apples back to Jack, so now Jack has 18 apples (Question 3). Finally, Jack took back 2 apples from Steve, leaving Jack with 20 apples (Question 4). Therefore, the answer is 20 apples.
Response:  We know that Jack is 6 years old and has 8 teeth.  So, he has 2 extra teeth compared to Steve who is 17 years old and has 16 teeth. Therefore, the difference between Jack's number of teeth and Steve's number of teeth is 2 (Jack - Steve).
Response:  We have to find out how many times 10 apples can be divided among 12 people. To do this, we need to divide 10 by 12. When we divide 10 by 12, we get 0.83. So, approximately 8-9 apples can be shared equally among 12 people. Therefore, the answer is 8-9 apples.

Response:  We know that there are 14 parshis in each jil (season). So, if we have 6 seasons, then the total number of parshis will be 6 x 14 = 84 parshis. Now, out of these 84 parshis, 3 are taken for each jil, which means we have 84 / 3 = 28 parshis left over after distributing them among the 3 jils. Therefore, the remaining parshis (after distribution) is 28.
Response:  We know that Jack is 84 years old and has 10 takkus (toes). So, he has 840 takkus in total (10 x 84 = 840). Now, we need to find out how many apis (fingers) Steve has. According to the question, Steve has 13 parshis (fingers), so he has 13 x 52 = 676 apis in total. Therefore, the difference between Jack's and Steve's count of takkus and apis is: 840 - 676 = 164.
Response:  We know that Jack has 13 pairs of shoes and he wants to exchange 5 pairs for different sizes. So, he will have 8 pairs of shoes left after exchanging 5 pairs. Now, we need to find out how many shoes Jack has in total including the ones he already had before exchanging any. Therefore, we add the number of shoes he already had (13) to the number of shoes he has left after exchanging (8), which gives us a total of 21 shoes owned by Jack.
Response:  We know that Jack has 8 tails and each tail has 5 spots. So, in total, Jack has 8 x 5 = 40 spots. Now, we are asked how many spots Stevie has if he has 11 apples and each apple has 3 spots. Therefore, Stevie has 11 x 3 = 33 spots. Finally, we are asked how many spots there are in total between Jack and Stevie. Since Jack has 40 spots and Stevie has 33 spots, together they have 40 + 33 = 73 spots.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 3 and 4 appear in the given sequence of numbers.  The sequence is : 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.  Now, let's count the number of times each digit appears in this sequence:  Number of times 3 appears = 3 (twice) + 24 (thrice) = 27 Number of times 4 appears = 4 (once) + 25 (once) = 26 Therefore, there are 27 occurrences of 3 and 26 occurrences of 4 in the given sequence of numbers.
Response:  We know that there are 78 jobs in total and we have to fill 15 of them. So, the number of vacancies left is 78 - 15 = 63. Now, out of these 63 vacancies, some may be already filled with experienced workers who don't need training. Let's assume that 20 of those vacancies are already filled (this is just an estimate, as we don't have any information about how many experienced workers are already working in the company). So, the actual number of vacancies left for new recruits is 63 - 20 = 43. Therefore, the answer is 43.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 78 is divisible by 33.  So, we need to divide 78 by 33 and see if it gives us an integer or not.  When we divide 78 by 33, we get 2 with remainder 15. Therefore, the number of times 78 is divisible by 33 is 15.
Response:  We know that 100 dollars were withdrawn from an ATM and there are 148 dollar bills in the stack. So, we can calculate the number of dollar bills as follows: Number of dollar bills = Total amount withdrawn / Amount per bill = 100 / 100 = 1. Therefore, there is one dollar bill in the stack. Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If we assume that each stack contains 100 dollar bills, then the total number of stacks would be: Number of stacks = Total amount withdrawn / Amount per stack = 159 / 100 = 1.59. Since you cannot have a fraction of a stack, we can round off the value to 2 stacks. Therefore, there are 2 stacks of dollar bills containing 100 bills each.
Response:  We know that there are 3 dollars in one rupee. So, if we have 49 dollars and we want to convert it into rupees, we can do so as follows: $49 x 3 = ₹1470. Therefore, the answer is ₹1470.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 53 branches of the bank in total. Out of these, 91 debit cards were issued to customers. Now, let's assume that each customer has an average of 2 debit cards (this is just for the sake of calculation and may not be true in reality). So, the number of debit cards issued to customers would be 91 x 2 = 182 debit cards. Next, we know that 14 of these debit cards were reported lost or stolen. Therefore, the remaining number of active debit cards with customers would be 182 - 14 = 168 debit cards. Finally, we need to calculate the percentage of debit cards that are active. To do this, we divide the number of active debit cards by the total number of debit cards issued (i.e., 168) and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of active debit cards is (168 / 182) x 100% = 90%.
Response:  We know that there are 106 dalits in the village and they have to work for 26 days in the fields of the upper caste people. So, the total number of days they will work is 26 x 106 = 2760 days. Now, we need to calculate how many bighas of land each dalit will get after working for 2760 days. As per the rule, one bigha of land is equivalent to 40 square kilometers or 10,000 square meters. Therefore, if we divide the total area of land (in square kilometers) worked by the dalits over 2760 days by the number of dalits, we can find out the average area of land received by each dalit. So, the calculation goes like this: Total area of land worked by dalits = 2760 x 40 = 11,040 square kilometers. Number of dalits = 106. Average area of land received by each dalit = Total area of land worked / Number of dalits = 11,040 / 106 = 103.5 square kilometers.
Response:  The question is asking about the number of days it took for a certain person to complete 29 marathons in 29 consecutive days. Since each marathon takes approximately 4-6 hours to complete, we can estimate the total time taken as follows: Time = Number of Marathons x Time per Marathon Total Time = 29 x 4 hours/marathon = 116 hours or 5 days and 4 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 days and 4 hours.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 38 can be divided by 128.  To do this, we need to divide 38 by 128 and see if there are any remainders.  If there is no remainder, then we know that 38 can be divided exactly by 128 once.  So, the answer is 1.

Response:  We know that there are 71 children in the school and they have to stand in line for lunch.  Since each child can hold only one plate at a time, we need to divide them into groups of 15 so that each group has enough plates to go around.  Therefore, the number of groups is 71 / 15 = 4.67 groups (round up to 5 groups).  So, each group will have 15 children standing in line together.
Response:  We know that there are 16 days in December and we have to find out how many Fridays are there in those 16 days. So, let's count the number of Fridays in December.  There are 7 days in a week and Friday is one of them. Therefore, if there are x days in December, then the number of Fridays in December will be x/7.  Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the equation x/7 = 5.  To do this, we can use the formula for division: dividend / divisor = quotient. In this case, the dividend is x (the number of days in December) and the divisor is 7 (the number of days in a week).  Substituting these values into the formula, we get: x / 7 = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 40.  Therefore, there are 40 Fridays in the 16 days of December.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between 17th February and 21st March.  To do this, we need to subtract the two dates.  So, 21st March - 17th February = 4 weeks. Therefore, there are 4 weeks between these two dates.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between two dates given in the question.  The first date is December 30th and the second date is January 2nd.  So, the difference between these two dates is 2 days.  Now, we need to calculate the number of weeks between these two dates.  There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide the total number of days by 7 to get the number of weeks.  Therefore, the number of weeks between December 30th and January 2nd is 2 / 7 = 0.286 weeks.

"Response:  We have to find out how many cards are there in total and then calculate what percentage of them are left after 301 cards are taken away.  So, let's first count the number of cards available for sale:

Total number of cards = 154 cards
Now, we need to subtract the number of cards that are already sold (301 cards):
Number of cards left for sale = Total number of cards - Number of cards sold = 154 cards - 301 cards = -147 cards
So, the percentage of cards left for sale is:
Percentage of cards left for sale = (-147 cards) / Total number of cards x 100% = -147/154 x 100% = -96%
Therefore, only 4% of the original 154 cards are left for sale after 301 cards are taken away."
Response:  We have to find out how many cards are there in total and then divide it by 52 to get the number of cards per deck.  So, let's calculate the total number of cards first.  There are 52 cards in each deck, so we need to multiply the number of decks by 52 to get the total number of cards.  In this case, there are 11 decks, so we need to multiply 11 x 52 = 594 cards.  Now, we need to divide the total number of cards by 52 to get the number of cards per deck.  Therefore, the answer is 594 / 52 = 11.67 cards per deck.

1. Divide 20 by 8:

20 / 8 = 2 (since 20 can be divided into 8 parts exactly twice)

2. Divide 34 by 20:

34 / 20 = 1.7 (since 34 cannot be divided into 20 parts exactly, so we get a remainder of 1.7)

Now, let's calculate the number of times each part can be used:

For 8 parts: Since 20 can be divided into 8 parts exactly twice, we can use each part 2/8 = 0.25 times.

For 34 parts: Since 20 cannot be divided into 34 parts exactly, we can use each part 1/20 = 0.05 times.

So, in total, there are 2 x 0.25 = 0.5 times when 8 parts can be used, and 1 x 0.05 = 0.05 times when 34 parts can be used."

Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 8 appears in the given string of numbers.  To do this, we can count the number of digits in each number and then check if they are multiples of 8.  For example, the first number is 1000, which has 4 digits. If we divide it by 8, we get 125 with remainder 0. So, there is one instance of 8 in that number. Similarly, for the second number, 2000, we get 250 with remainder 0 when divided by 8. Therefore, there are two instances of 8 in that number.  Now let's move on to the third number, 3000, which has 6 digits. When divided by 8, we get 375 with remainder 0. So, there are three instances of 8 in that number.  Continuing this process, we see that there are 8 instances of 8 in the entire string of numbers.  Therefore, the answer is 8.
Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and we have to divide it into equal parts of 15 minutes each. So, we will have 24 x 15 = 360 minutes in a day. Now, let's calculate how many times Marko can take a break of 15 minutes in a day.  We know that Marko takes breaks for 15 minutes every hour, so he takes 8 breaks in a day (24 hours / 15 minutes per hour). Therefore, the number of breaks Marko can take in a day is 8 x 360 = 2880 breaks.
Response:  We have to find out how many strands of hair are there in 36 balls of wool. Each ball of wool contains 8 strands of hair. So, we need to divide 36 by 8 to get the number of strands of hair in each ball of wool.  Therefore, there are 4.5 strands of hair in each ball of wool (36 / 8 = 4.5). Now, let's calculate the total number of strands of hair in all 12 balls of wool. Since each ball of wool has 4.5 strands of hair, the total number of strands of hair in all 12 balls of wool is 12 x 4.5 = 54 strands of hair.
Response:  We know that there are 22 ponds in the market and each pond has 30 fishes. So, the total number of fishes in all ponds is 22 x 30 = 660 fishes. Now, we need to find out how many fishes are left after 15 days. To do this, we will subtract the number of fishes that were sold during these 15 days from the total number of fishes available. If 36 fishes were sold during these 15 days, then the remaining fishes would be 660 - 36 = 624 fishes. Therefore, there are 624 fishes left in all ponds after 15 days.

Response:  We know that there are 41 pillars in Basilica of San Petronio. Out of these, 18 are columns and 23 are arches. So, the number of pillars that are not arches is 18 - 23 = -5. Therefore, there are 5 non-arch pillars in Basilica of San Petronio.
Response:  We know that there are 21 days in March and we have to find out how many weeks are there in 3 months. So, we divide 21 days by 7 (the number of days in a week) which gives us 3 weeks. Now, let's calculate the total number of days in 3 months. We multiply 3 weeks by 7 days per week which gives us 21 days. Therefore, there are 21 days in 3 months.
Response:  We know that there are 63 pills in total and we have to divide them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 12.6 pills (63/5). Now, let's consider the situation where one of the people has taken 14 pills already. In this case, the remaining 4 people will get 12.6 pills each, which is equal to 50.4 pills in total (12.6 x 4 = 50.4). Therefore, the answer is 50.4 pills.
Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are there in each group of 36 numbers and then sum them up.  In the first group of 36 numbers, we have 6 groups of 6 numbers each, so the number of numbers is 6 x 6 = 36.  Similarly, in the second group of 36 numbers, we have 4 groups of 9 numbers each, so the number of numbers is 4 x 9 = 36.  Therefore, the total number of numbers in both groups is 36 + 36 = 72.

Now, we need to calculate the number of hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, the total number of hours between 23rd March and 24th March is 24 x 60 = 1440 hours. Finally, we divide this value by 60 to get the number of minutes between these two dates. So, there are 1440 / 60 = 24 minutes between 23rd March and 24th March.
Response:  We know that there are 51 weeks in a year and each week has 7 days. So, the total number of days in a year is 51 x 7 = 357 days. Now, we need to find out how many times 133 days fit into a year. To do this, we divide the number of days in a year (357) by the number of days in 133 days (26). Therefore, the answer is 357 / 26 = 14. So, 133 days fit into a year 14 times.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 10 appears in the series of 54 numbers given in the question.  So, we will count the number of times each number appears in the series and then multiply it by 10 to get the total number of times that number appears in all 54 numbers.  For example, the number 5 appears in the series 5 times, so if we multiply 5 by 10, we get 50. Similarly, the number 2 appears in the series 7 times, so if we multiply 7 by 10, we get 70. Therefore, the total number of times each number appears in all 54 numbers is as follows: Number Appearances Total Number of Times 1 6 6 x 10 = 60 2 7 7 x 10 = 70 3 4 4 x 10 = 40 4 2 2 x 10 = 20 5 1 1 x 10 = 10 6 1 1 x 10 = 10 7 1 1 x 10 = 10 8 1 1 x 10 = 10 9 1 1 x 10 = 10 10 1 1 x 10 = 10 Based on this calculation, the answer to the question is 60 + 70 + 40 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 350.
"Response:  We know that there are 145 vowels in Telugu language and we need to find out how many of them are repeated in the given text. So, let's count the number of repeating vowels in the text.  From the text, we can see that there are 72 words containing vowels. Now, let's check each word whether it contains any repeating vowel or not.  For example, the first word ""బేకర్"" has only one vowel ""బ"", so it doesn't repeat any vowel. Similarly, the second word ""కోణ్ని"" has two vowels ""క"" and ""న"", but neither of them is repeated anywhere else in the text.  Therefore, the first word does not contribute to the total count of repeating vowels. Similarly, for all other words, we can analyze their vowel composition and determine if they contain any repeating vowels. After analyzing all 72 words, we found that none of them have any repeating vowels. Hence, the answer is zero (0)."

If there is no remainder, then that number of times 155 divides into 140.  In this case, when we divide 155 by 140, we get a remainder of 35. Therefore, 155 divides into 140 exactly 4 times.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 105 is divisible by 3 and also we need to find out how many times 170 is divisible by 3. So, let us first calculate the number of times 105 is divisible by 3.  We know that 105 = 3 x 3 x 33, so 105 is divisible by 3 exactly 33 times. Now, let us calculate the number of times 170 is divisible by 3.  We know that 170 = 3 x 56, so 170 is divisible by 3 exactly 56 times. Therefore, the total number of times both numbers are divisible by 3 is (33 + 56) = 89.
Response:  We know that there are 13 keys in total and we have to find out how many of them are not used in any of the given combinations.  So, let's count the number of unused keys as follows:  Key 1 is not used in any of the given combinations, so it is an unused key.  Similarly, key 2 is also not used in any of the given combinations, so it is another unused key.  Now, let's move on to key 3. In combination (A), key 3 is used once, but in all other combinations, it is not used at all. Therefore, key 3 is an unused key.  Similarly, key 4 is used only once in combination (C), but otherwise it is not used in any of the given combinations. Hence, key 4 is another unused key.  Moving on, key 5 is used twice in combinations (A) and (D), but otherwise it is not used in any of the given combinations. So, key 5 is an unused key.  Next, key 6 is used thrice in combinations (B), (C), and (E), but otherwise it is not used in any of the given combinations. Thus, key 6 is yet another unused key.  Now, let's consider key 7. It is used only once in combination (F). Since none of the remaining keys are used with key 7, it can be considered an unused key.  Similarly, key 8 is used only once in combination (G), and since none of the remaining keys are used with key 8 either, it too can be classified as an unused key.  Moving on, key 9 is used twice in combinations (H) and (I), but otherwise it is not used in any of the given combinations. So, key 9 is another unused key.  Finally, key 10 is used three times in combinations (J), (K), and (L), but otherwise it is not used in any of the given combinations. Therefore, key 10 is the last unused key among the 13 keys.  Based on our counting above, we have found 7 unused keys - keys 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 10.  Therefore,
Response:  We have to find out how many times 78 is divisible by 31.  So we need to divide 78 by 31 and see if it gives us a whole number or not.  When we divide 78 by 31, we get 2 with remainder 57.  Therefore, there are 57 times that 78 is divisible by 31.

Response:  We know that Kelli has 20 nickels and 70 dimes. So, in total, she has $12 worth of coins (20 x $0.05 = $1 + 70 x $0.10 = $7). Now, we are asked how many times Kelli can buy an ice cream cone with her money. Since one ice cream cone costs $1, Kelli can buy $\boxed{12 / $1 = 12}$ ice cream cones with her entire amount of money.
Response:  We know that Kelli is 46 years old and has 132 sones of gemstones. If she gives 31 sones to her friend, then how many sones does she have left? So, Kelli has 101 sones of gemstones left after giving 31 sones to her friend.
Response:  We know that Kelli is 31 years old and has been working at Nintendo for 6 months. Therefore, her total work experience in months is 31 + 6 = 37 months. Now, we need to calculate how many games she has developed during this time period. As per the question, Kelli has developed 80 games so far. So, we can calculate the number of games she has developed per month as follows: Number of games developed = Total work experience / Time taken to develop one game In this case, the time taken to develop one game is not provided in the question. However, assuming an average time of around 2-3 months to develop a game, we can estimate the number of games Kelli has developed per month as follows: Number of games developed per month = 37 months x (Number of games developed / Time taken to develop one game) = 37 months x (80 games /??) = 1540 - 2160 games Developed per month Based on the calculation above, we can conclude that Kelli has developed between 1540 - 2160 games during her 37 months of work experience at Nintendo.
"Response:  We have to find out how many blanks are there in each row of the matrix and then sum them up.  In the given matrix, each row has 5 blanks except for the first row which has 4 blanks. So, we need to subtract 4 from the total number of blanks in each row to get the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is:

Total number of blanks = Number of rows x Total number of blanks per row - (Number of rows x Number of blanks in the first row)
= 52 x 4 - 5 x 4
= 210 - 20
= 190
Therefore, there are 190 blanks in the given matrix."
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are there in total and then divide it by 72 to get the number of blocks per tier. So, let's calculate the total number of blocks first. According to the question, there are 97 blocks in total. Now, we need to find out how many blocks are there in each tier. The question states that there are 72 blocks in each tier. Therefore, the number of tiers is equal to the total number of blocks divided by 72. So, the number of tiers = Total Number of Blocks / 72 = 97 / 72 = 1.34 tiers. Since there are 10 tiers in a layer, we can round off the result to 1 tier. Therefore, the answer is 1 tier.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are there in total and then calculate the number of blocks that can be made with each size.  Total number of blocks = 79 blocks x 14 sizes = 1062 blocks  Now, let's see how many blocks we can make with each size:  Size 1: 1 block Size 2: 2 blocks Size 3: 4 blocks Size 4: 8 blocks Size 5: 16 blocks Size 6: 32 blocks Size 7: 64 blocks Size 8: 128 blocks Size 9: 256 blocks Size 10: 512 blocks Therefore, the number of blocks that can be made with each size is as follows:  Size 1: 1 block Size 2: 2 blocks Size 3: 4 blocks Size 4: 8 blocks Size 5: 16 blocks Size 6: 32 blocks Size 7: 64 blocks Size 8: 128 blocks Size 9: 256 blocks Size 10: 512 blocks So, the total number of blocks that can be made is 1062 blocks.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 58 is divisible by 27 and also how many times it is divisible by 53.  So, we need to perform two calculations separately.  Firstly, let us calculate how many times 58 is divisible by 27.  We know that 58 / 27 = 2 with remainder 16. Therefore, 58 is divisible by 27 exactly 2 times. Now, let us calculate how many times 58 is divisible by 53. We know that 58 / 53 = 1 with remainder 0. Therefore, 58 is divisible by 53 exactly once.  So, the final answer is 2 + 1 = 3 times.
Response:  We have to find out how many blocks are there in total and then calculate the number of blocks that can be made with each size.  So, let's start with the total number of blocks first.  There are 37 blocks in total. Now, we need to divide it by the size of each block to get the number of blocks that can be made with each size.  For example, if we take the smallest size (1x1), we can make 33 blocks from those 37 blocks. Similarly, for the medium-sized blocks (2x2), we can make 13 blocks from the remaining 6 blocks after subtracting the small blocks. Therefore, the final answer is: Total Number of Blocks = 37 Blocks / Size of Each Block = 37 x 3 = 111 Blocks
Response:  We know that the number of balls in one bag is 86 and we have to find out how many bags are required to contain all these balls.  Since there are 79 balls in the first bag, we need at least 1 bag to accommodate those balls. Similarly, since there are 82 balls in the second bag, we need at least 2 bags to accommodate those balls as well. Therefore, the total number of bags required = 1 + 2 = 3. So, three bags are needed to contain all the 86 balls.

"Response:  We know that there are 16 verbs in the sentence and 14 nouns. So, we have to find out how many pairs of verbs and nouns are there.  To do this, we need to count the number of times each verb appears with each noun.  For example, the verb ""to eat"" appears only once with the noun ""food"", so there is one pair of verb-noun. Similarly, the verb ""to drink"" appears twice with the noun ""water"", so there are two pairs of verb-noun. Therefore, the total number of pairs of verbs and nouns is:  Pairs of Verbs and Nouns = 1 + 2 +... + x = 16 (verbs) x 14 (nouns) / 2 = 78 pairs  So, there are 78 pairs of verbs and nouns in the sentence."
Response:  We know that there are 8 verbs in the sentence and each verb has 2 forms (present and past). So, we have 8 x 2 = 16 forms of each verb. Now, let's count how many times each verb appears in the given sentence:  * వెర్రి (verb) - 4 appearances  * వెర్రి (noun) - 3 appearances  * పాఠశాల (noun) - 2 appearances  Total number of appearances of each verb in the sentence is:  * వెర్రి - 4  * వెర్రి - 3  * పాఠశాల - 2 Therefore, the total number of appearances of each verb in the sentence is: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 appearances.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 verbs in the first list and 11 verbs in the second list. So, the total number of verbs is 10 + 11 = 21. Now, we need to find out how many of these verbs are common between the two lists. To do this, we will compare each verb in the first list with every verb in the second list. If a verb appears in both lists, we will mark it as present; otherwise, we will mark it as absent. Thus, the number of common verbs between the two lists is 21 - (10 x 11/2) = 21 - 11 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 common verbs between the two lists."
"Response:  We know that there are 11 verbs in the first list and 17 verbs in the second list. So, if we want to find out how many common verbs there are between the two lists, we need to subtract the number of verbs in the first list from the number of verbs in the second list. Therefore, the number of common verbs is:

Common Verbs = Number of verbs in Second List - Number of verbs in First List
= 17 - 11
= 6
So, there are 6 common verbs between the two lists."
Response:  We are given that there are 8 pups in the litter and each pup has 14 teeth. So, the total number of teeth in the litter is:  Number of pups x Total number of teeth per pup = 8 x 14 = 112 teeth. Therefore, there are 112 teeth in the litter.

Response:  We know that there are 8 vehicles in total and out of them, 7 are cars. So, the number of car owners is 7 x 1 = 7. Now, we have to find out how many people own more than one vehicle. Out of the remaining 5 vehicles (which are not cars), 3 are bikes and 2 are scooters. So, the number of people who own more than one vehicle is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the final answer is 7 + 5 = 12 people who own at least two vehicles.
Response:  We know that there are 11 puppets in total and each puppet has 40 strings attached to it. So, the total number of strings is 11 x 40 = 440 strings. Now, we need to find out how many times these 440 strings can be tied to the stage. To do this, we will divide the total number of strings by the number of puppets (11). So, the number of strings per puppet is 440 / 11 = 40 strings per puppet. Therefore, all 11 puppets have 40 strings each, which means they can tie 440 strings to the stage.

Response:  We know that there are 8 vehicles in total and out of them, 5 are cars. So, the number of car owners is 5 x 8 = 40. Now, we have to find out how many of these 40 car owners have more than one vehicle. To do this, we need to subtract the number of car owners who only have one vehicle from the total number of car owners. Therefore, the number of car owners with more than one vehicle is 40 - (20 + 10) = 30.
Response:  We have to find out how many tickets are available for each of the two classes (A and B) in each of the seven trains.  For this, we need to know the number of passengers who booked tickets in each class for each train.  So, let's assume that there are $x$ passengers who booked tickets in Class A and $y$ passengers who booked tickets in Class B for Train 1. Similarly, there are $z$ passengers who booked tickets in Class A and $w$ passengers who booked tickets in Class B for Train 2. Now, we want to find out how many tickets are left for each class in each train. To do this, we can divide the total number of tickets available for each class by the number of passengers who booked tickets in that class. For Train 1, the total number of tickets available is $7 \times 2 = 14$, and for Train 2, it is $6 \times 2 = 12$. Therefore, the number of tickets left for Class A in Train 1 is $\frac{14}{x} = 7$, and the number of tickets left for Class B in Train 1 is $\frac{14}{y} = 9$. Similarly, the number of tickets left for Class A in Train 2 is $\frac{12}{z} = 8$, and the number of tickets left for Class B in Train 2 is $\frac{12}{w} = 10$. Thus, there are $7$ tickets left for Class A in Train 1 and $8$ tickets left for Class A in Train 2, and there are $9$ tickets left for Class B in Train 1 and $10$ tickets left for Class B in Train 2.
Response:  We know that there are 12 tickets in total for the concert. Out of these, 6 tickets have been already sold to Dev and his friends. So, the remaining tickets left for sale are 12 - 6 = 6 tickets. Now, we need to find out how many tickets will be available for each row of seats. There are 4 rows of seats in total, and each row has 3 seats. Therefore, the number of tickets available per row is 4 x 3 = 12 tickets per row. Since there are 6 tickets left for sale, we can divide them equally among the 4 rows of seats, resulting in 6 / 4 = 1.5 tickets per seat. So, there will be 1 ticket available for every 2 seats in each row.
Response:  We know that there are 18 tickets in total for Dev to buy.  Out of these, he has already bought 5 tickets, so we have remaining tickets = Total tickets - Number of tickets bought = 18 - 5 = 13.  Now, out of these remaining tickets, Dev wants to buy 11 tickets. So, number of tickets left after buying 11 tickets = Remaining tickets - Number of tickets bought = 13 - 11 = 2. Therefore, Dev has 2 tickets left to buy.
Response:  We know that there are 19 tickets in total for Dev to buy.  Out of these, he has already bought 7 tickets. So, the number of tickets left for him to buy is 19 - 7 = 12 tickets. Now, we need to find out how many blocks each ticket can be divided into. There are 12 tickets left for Dev to buy, and each ticket can be divided into 4 blocks (as per the given information). Therefore, the total number of blocks Dev needs to buy is 12 x 4 = 48 blocks.
"Response:  We know that there are 13 ticks in one day and each tick lasts for 8 hours. So, the total time period of 13 ticks is:

$$ \therefore Total\ time\ period = 13\ times\ 8\ hours = 104\ hours $$
Now, we have to find out how many days it will take to complete 18 months. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ days = 18\ months / 24\ hours/day = 750\ days $$

Response:  We have to find out how many tickets are left for each day of the week and then calculate the total number of tickets available.  Monday has 3 tickets remaining, Tuesday has 5 tickets remaining, Wednesday has 7 tickets remaining, Thursday has 9 tickets remaining, Friday has 1 ticket remaining, Saturday has 3 tickets remaining, and Sunday has 5 tickets remaining. Therefore, the total number of tickets available is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 35 tickets.
Response:  We have to find out how many chances are there for each of the 14 options in the given tree diagram.  Option A has 3 children, so it has 3 chances. Option B has 2 children, so it has 2 chances. Option C has 1 child, so it has only one chance. Similarly, we can calculate the number of chances for each option and get the final answer as follows:  Number of chances = (Number of children) x (Number of options) So, the total number of chances is:  Number of chances = (3) x (14) = 42  Therefore, there are 42 chances for each of the 14 options in the given tree diagram.
"Response:  We have to find out how many chances are there for each of the 13 letters in the word ""HELLO"". Since there are 6 vowels and 7 consonants in the word, we can assume that each vowel has 2 chances (since there are 2 vowels) and each consonant has 3 chances (since there are 7 consonants). Therefore, the total number of chances for each letter is:  Vowels: 2 x 6 = 12 Consonants: 3 x 7 = 21 So, there are 12 + 21 = 33 chances for each of the 13 letters in the word ""HELLO""."
Response:  We have to find out how many chances are there for each of the 20 cards in the deck. Since there are only 4 aces in the deck, each ace has 5 chances (since there are 4 aces and 16 non-ace cards). Similarly, each of the other cards has 5 chances as well. So, the total number of chances for all 20 cards is 5 x 20 = 100. Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace is 1/100 or approximately 0.01.

Response:  We have to find out how many times 16 is divisible by 57 and also how many times 57 is divisible by 16.  So, we need to perform two calculations separately.  Firstly, let us calculate how many times 16 is divisible by 57: 16 / 57 = 0.274 (round off to nearest integer). Since it is not an exact multiple of 57, this calculation gives us zero as the number of times 16 divides into 57 exactly. Now, let us move on to calculating how many times 57 is divisible by 16: 57 / 16 = 3.5 (again rounding off to the nearest integer). Therefore, there are three multiples of 57 that divide into 16 exactly.  So, the final answer is 3.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 67 is divisible by 12.  So, we need to divide 67 by 12 and see if it gives any remainder.

Similarly, the second number (27) appears twice, and so on until we reach the last number (52), which appears five times in the series. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each number from 1 to 28 in the series is as follows:  
Number Appearances   
1 - 1    
2 - 2    
3 - 0    
4 - 0    
5 - 0    
6 - 0    
7 - 0    
8 - 0    
9 - 0    
10 - 0    
11 - 0    
12 - 0    
13 - 0    
14 - 0    
15 - 0    
16 - 0    
17 - 0    
18 - 0    
19 - 0    
20 - 0    
21 - 0    
22 - 0    
23 - 0    
24 - 0    
25 - 0    
26 - 1    
27 - 2    
28 - 5    
So, there are a total of 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 28 numbers in the series."
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 100 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The first number is 82, which means that the digit 8 appears twice in the sequence.  Similarly, the digits 9 and 7 appear once each.  Therefore, we can write down the following equation:

Number of appearances of each digit in the sequence = Number of occurrences of that digit in the starting number (82)

Now let's substitute the values for each digit:

Digit 8 appears twice in 82, so it will appear 2 times in the entire sequence.
Digit 9 appears once in 82, so it will appear 1 time in the entire sequence.
Digit 7 appears once in 82, so it will appear 1 time in the entire sequence.

Therefore, the total number of appearances of each digit in the sequence is as follows:

Digit 8 - 2
Digit 9 - 1
Digit 7 - 1

So there are altogether 4 appearances of each digit in the sequence."
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and April together. So, if we subtract 45 days from 31 days, we get -14 days. Therefore, the number of days left after deducting 45 days from 31 days is -14 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 44 appears in the list of 70 numbers.  Since there are 70 numbers, we can divide them into groups of 10 each.  So, for the first group of 10 numbers, the number 1 appears once, the number 2 appears twice, and so on until all the numbers up to 44 appear exactly once. Similarly, for the second group of 10 numbers, the number 1 appears again, followed by the number 2, and so on until all the remaining numbers up to 44 appear exactly once. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each number from 1 to 44 is as follows: Number Appearances 1 10 2 20 3 30 4 40 5 50 6 60 7 70 Thus, the answer to the question is 70.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 10 numbers appears in the list of 74 numbers.  Since there are 10 numbers in total, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of appearances of number $x$ = Number of occurrences of $x$ in the list of 74 numbers

Now, let's substitute the values for each number from 1 to 10 into this equation and calculate their respective appearances:

1. Appearance of number 1 = 5 (since it occurs 5 times in the list)
2. Appearance of number 2 = 7 (since it occurs 7 times in the list)
3. Appearance of number 3 = 9 (since it occurs 9 times in the list)
4. Appearance of number 4 = 6 (since it occurs 6 times in the list)
5. Appearance of number 5 = 8 (since it occurs 8 times in the list)
6. Appearance of number 6 = 4 (since it occurs 4 times in the list)
7. Appearance of number 7 = 3 (since it occurs 3 times in the list)
8. Appearance of number 8 = 5 (since it occurs 5 times in the list)
9. Appearance of number 9 = 1 (since it occurs only once in the list)
10. Appearance of number 10 = 2 (since it occurs twice in the list)

Therefore, the answer is:

Appearances of each number in the list of 74 numbers:

* Number 1: 5
* Number 2: 7
* Number 3: 9
* Number 4: 6
* Number 5: 8
* Number 6: 4
* Number 7: 3
* Number 8: 5
* Number 9: 1
* Number 10: 2"
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 54 appears in the given series of numbers.  The first number is 18, which means that the next number after 18 will be 36 (since there are 20 numbers between 1 and 54). So, we can start counting from 18 and go up to 54, like this: 18, 36, 54. Now, let's count how many times each number appears in this sequence:  Number Appearance Count : 18 - 1 20 36 - 2 20 54 - 3 3 Therefore, the answer is 3.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 5."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 65 appears in the remaining 46 numbers after removing the first six numbers (which are already known).  To do this, we can use a systematic approach as follows:  For each of the remaining 46 numbers, check if it is among the first six numbers (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). If it is, then ignore it and move on to the next number. Otherwise, count it as one of the unknown numbers.  Now, let's count the total number of appearances of each number from 1 to 65 in the remaining 46 numbers:  Number of appearances of 1: 0  Number of appearances of 2: 0  Number of appearances of 3: 0  Number of appearances of 4: 0  Number of appearances of 5: 0  Number of appearances of 6: 6  Number of appearances of other numbers (from 7 to 65): 40 Therefore, there are 40 unknown numbers among the remaining 46 numbers.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 41 appears in the first 86 digits of the decimal representation of pi.  To do this, we need to count the number of occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in these 86 digits and then calculate the proportion of digits that are 4.  Here is what we get:

Digit Count:

* 0: 3
* 1: 7
* 2: 15
* 3: 11
* 4: 41 (appears 4 times)
* 5: 1
* 6: 1
* 7: 1
* 8: 1
* 9: 1

Total Digits: 86

Proportion of Digits that are 4:

$ \frac{Number\ of\ times\ 4\ appears}{Total\ Number\ of\ Digits} $ = $\frac{4}{86}$ = $\frac{1}{21}$

So, the number 41 appears once every 21 digits in the decimal representation of pi."
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 71 appears in the first 60 numbers of the series.  To do this, we need to count the number of occurrences of 71 among the first 60 terms.  So, let's calculate it as follows:  Number of occurrences of 71 among the first 60 terms = Total number of terms - Number of terms containing 71  = 60 - 2 = 58  Therefore, there are 58 occurrences of 71 among the first 60 terms of the series.

Response:  We know that there are 100 t-shirts in total and we have to divide them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 25 t-shirts (100/4 = 25). Now, let's assume that one of the people has already taken 95 t-shirts (25 + 95 = 120), leaving only 5 t-shirts for the remaining three people (100 - 120 = 20). Therefore, each of the remaining three people will get 5 t-shirts (20 / 3 = 5).
Response:  We know that there are 242 t-shirts in total and we have to distribute them equally among 115 people. So, each person will get $\frac{242}{115} = 2$ t-shirts per person. Therefore, the number of t-shirts each person will receive is $2 \times 115 = 230$.
Response:  We know that there are 163 t-shirts in total and we have to find out how many of them are left after selling 89 t-shirts. To do this, we need to divide the total number of t-shirts by the number of t-shirts sold. So, the answer is: Number of t-shirts left = Total number of t-shirts - Number of t-shirts sold = 163 - 89 = 74 t-shirts.
Response:  We know that there are 186 t-shirts in total and we have to distribute them equally among 5 people. So, each person will get 35 t-shirts (186 / 5 = 35). Now, let's assume that one of the people has already taken 10 t-shirts as their share. So, now there are 45 t-shirts left (35 + 10 = 45). And we need to distribute these 45 t-shirts equally among the remaining 4 people. So, each person will get 11 t-shirts (45 / 4 = 11). Therefore, the final distribution is: Person 1 - 35 t-shirts Person 2 - 35 t-shirts Person 3 - 35 t-shirts Person 4 - 11 t-shirts
Response:  We know that there are 183 t-shirts in total and we want to find out how many of them are red. So, let's divide the number of red t-shirts (31) by the total number of t-shirts (183).

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the refrigerator and its accessories as follows: Total Cost = Price of Refrigerator + Price of Accessories = $67 x 2 + $165 = $398 Now, let's find out how many months it will take to save enough money for the refrigerator based on the monthly savings amount mentioned in the question: Monthly Savings Amount = $67 / 12 = $5.50 per month To determine how many months it will take to save enough money for the refrigerator, we can use the following formula: Number of Months = Total Cost / Monthly Savings Amount = $398 / $5.50 = 72 months Therefore, it will take approximately 72 months or 6 years to save enough money for the refrigerator based on the given monthly savings amount.
Response:  We know that there are 157 T-shirts and 192 dresses available for purchase.  If we buy all the T-shirts, then we will have spent $192 x 157 = $30,695.  Similarly, if we buy all the dresses, then we will have spent $192 x 19 = $3,688. So, the total amount spent is $30,695 + $3,688 = $34,383. Therefore, the answer is $34,383.
Response:  We know that there are 100 t-shirts in total and we have to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 25 t-shirts (100/4 = 25). Now, let's see how many jerseys each person will get based on the number of t-shirts they received. If Person A got 25 t-shirts, then they will also get 25 jerseys (since 1 t-shirt = 1 jersey). Similarly, if Person B got 20 t-shirts, then they will get 20 jerseys. And so on... Therefore, the final distribution is as follows:  Person A - 25 t-shirts, 25 jerseys Person B - 20 t-shirts, 20 jerseys Person C - 15 t-shirts, 15 jerseys Person D - 5 t-shirts, 5 jerseys Thus, the total number of t-shirts distributed is 25 + 20 + 15 + 5 = 75 t-shirts.
Response:  We have to find out how many times $ 51 can be divided into $ 8 and get remainders.  So, we need to divide $ 51 by $ 8 and see what is left over.  If there are no remains, then it means that $ 51 can be divided exactly into $ 8 parts with no remainder.  But if there is a remainder, then it means that $ 51 cannot be divided exactly into $ 8 parts and some amount will be left over.  Therefore, the number of times $ 51 can be divided into $ 8 with a remainder is equal to the number of times $ 51 can be divided exactly into $ 8 parts minus the number of times $ 51 can be divided exactly into $ 8 parts with a remainder.  In this case, $ 51 can be divided exactly into $ 8 parts without any remainder, so the number of times $ 51 can be divided into $ 8 with a remainder is zero (0).  Hence, the answer is zero (0).
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 201 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 217, 201, 193, 185, 177, 169, 161, 153, 145, 137, 129, 121, 113, 105, 97, 89, 81, 73, 65, 57, 49, 41, 33, 25, 17, 9, 1.  Since there are 20 terms in the sequence, we can see that the number 201 appears once in the sequence. Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  We have to find out how much money is required for each T-shirt and then calculate the total cost of 50 T-shirts.  The cost of one T-shirt is given as $20.

So, we need to calculate the total amount earned from selling those shares. The calculation is as follows: Total Amount Earned = Number of Shares x Average Sale Price Total Amount Earned = 20 x $215 = $4,300 Now, let's find out how many dollars Rajesh earned per share. To do this, we divide the total amount earned by the number of shares sold: Dollars Earned Per Share = Total Amount Earned / Number of Shares Sold Dollars Earned Per Share = $4,300 / 20 = $215 per share Therefore, Rajesh earned $215 per share from selling his 20 Tesla shares.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the refrigerator and its accessories as follows: Total Cost = Price of Refrigerator + Price of Accessories = $76 x 3 + $204 = $580 Now, let's find out how much money is left after buying the refrigerator and its accessories: Money Left After Buying = Total Cost - Amount Spent = $580 - $76 = $504 So, there are $504 left after buying the refrigerator and its accessories.
Response:  We know that Rajesh has invested $ 210 in Jerry's stock and earned $ 240 as profit. So, his total gain is $ 240 - $ 210 = $ 30 per share. Now, we need to find out how many shares he holds. According to the question, Rajesh owns 177 shares of Jerry's stock. Therefore, his total profit from all 177 shares is $ 30 x 177 = $ 5,290.
Response:  We know that Rajesh has 115 dollars in his account and he spends 25 dollars on each of the next 4 months. So, he will have 115 - 25 x 4 = 90 dollars left after 4 months. Now, we need to find out how many jerseys he can buy with this amount. The cost of one jersey is 30 dollars, so he can buy 90 / 30 = 3 jerseys with the remaining money. Therefore, Rajesh can buy 3 jerseys.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 5 appears in the given sequence of numbers: 5, 25, 75, 345, 987.  To do this, we can count the number of occurrences of the digit 5 in each number:  Number 5 occurs once in the first number (5), twice in the second number (25), thrice in the third number (75), four times in the fourth number (345), and five times in the fifth number (987). Therefore, the total number of times the digit 5 appears in the given sequence is 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 17. So, there are 17 instances of the digit 5 in the given sequence of numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 2 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The first number is 12, which has 2 as its factor.  So, we get 12 = 2 x 6.  Next, we have 15, which also has 2 as its factor.  So, we get 15 = 2 x 7-1.  Similarly, for each subsequent number, we can find the factors and count the number of appearances of 2.  Therefore, there are 2 x 6 = 12 appearances of the number 2 in the given sequence of numbers.

Response:  We know that there are 11 sets of 5 cards each in the deck. So, the total number of cards in the deck is 11 x 5 = 55 cards. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of cards have the same rank but different suits. To do this, we can count the number of cards with each rank and subtract it from the total number of cards in the deck. For example, if there are 5 cards of rank Ace (which has only one suit), then there will be 5 - 1 = 4 Aces in the deck. Similarly, for other ranks also. Therefore, the number of pairs of cards with the same rank but different suits is 55 / 4 = 13.75 pairs. Since you cannot have a fraction of a pair, round up to 14 pairs. So, the answer is 14 pairs of cards with the same rank but different suits.

For example, the word ""beauty"" is related to nature, so it appears once in the list. Similarly, the word ""ugly"" is its opposite, so it also appears once in the list. Therefore, there are 12 words related to nature and their opposites in the list. Now, we need to find out how many times each number from 1 to 36 appears in these 12 words. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of appearances = Total number of words / Number of words related to nature. In this case, the total number of words is 36, and the number of words related to nature is 12. So, we divide 36 by 12 to get the number of appearances of each number from 1 to 36 in the list of 12 words related to nature: Number of appearances = 36 / 12 = 3  Therefore, the number that appears most frequently in the list of 12 words related to nature is 3, which appears three times in the list."

From the question, we know that there are 31 pensils in a box. Now, we need to find out how many boxes are there. The question states that there are 6 packets of 10 pensils each. Therefore, the total number of boxes = Number of packets x Number of pensils in a packet = 6 x 10 = 60 boxes. Now, we have found the total number of pensils = Total number of boxes x Number of pensils in a box = 60 x 31 = 1860 pensils. Finally, to find out the number of pensils per pack, we divide the total number of pensils by 6 = 1860 / 6 = 310 pensils per pack.
"Response:  We know that 30 days have passed since February 1st, and we want to calculate how many pensiless (or penless) days there are in this period of time.  To do this, we need to subtract the number of penless days from the total number of days.  So, if there were 71 penless days out of 95 days (which is equal to 75%), then the percentage of penless days would be:

(71/95) x 100 = 75%

Therefore, there were 75% or 71/100 of the days penless during this period of time."
"Response:  We have to find out how many pensil marks are there in total and then calculate the average of those marks.  So, let's first count the number of penil marks for each row:

Row 1: 5 pensils x 6 rows = 30 pensil marks
Row 2: 4 pensils x 6 rows = 24 pensil marks
Row 3: 7 pensils x 6 rows = 42 pensil marks
Row 4: 8 pensils x 6 rows = 48 pensil marks
Row 5: 9 pensils x 6 rows = 54 pensil marks
Row 6: 10 pensils x 6 rows = 60 pensil marks
Total number of pensil marks = 30 + 24 + 42 + 48 + 54 + 60 = 300 pensil marks
Now, we need to divide the total number of pensil marks by the number of rows (i.e., 6) to get the average number of pensil marks per row:
Average number of pensil marks per row = Total number of pensil marks / Number of rows = 300 / 6 = 50 pensil marks per row
Therefore, the answer is 50 pensil marks per row."
Response:  We have to find out how many females are there in each of the 21 circles and then sum them up.  Out of these 21 circles, 98% of them have more than one female, which means that 98/21 = 4.6 males per circle on average. Since we want to know the number of males in each circle, we subtract the number of females from the total number of individuals in each circle. So, for each circle, we have: (Number of males) = (Total number of individuals - Number of females). Now, let's calculate the number of males in each circle: Circle 1: Total number of individuals = 30, Females = 15, Males = 30 - 15 = 15 Circle 2: Total number of individuals = 40, Females = 20, Males = 40 - 20 = 20 Circle 3: Total number of individuals = 50, Females = 25, Males = 50 - 25 = 25 And so on... Therefore, the number of males in each circle is: Circle 1: 15 males Circle 2: 20 males Circle 3: 25 males...and so on...

To do this, we will divide the total number of households by the number of households with at least one member who is employed as an agricultural laborer. Based on the information provided earlier, there are 2 seats reserved for scheduled castes in the panchayat. Therefore, we will multiply the total number of households by 2 to get the estimated number of households with at least one member who is employed as an agricultural laborer. Finally, we will round off the result to the nearest integer. So, the estimated number of households with at least one member who is employed as an agricultural laborer in this panchayat is 4960 x 2 = 9920 households.
"Response:  We know that there are 24 hours in a day and 120 minutes in an hour. So, we have:

$$ \text {Total time} = 24 \times 60 = 1440 \text{ minutes} $$

Response:  We have to find out how many times each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the string of numbers given below:  66 - 0 appears once, 1 appears twice, 2 appears thrice, 3 appears four times, 4 appears five times, 5 appears six times, and so on until we reach 9 which appears only once. Therefore, there are 7 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9) in total. Now let's count the number of times each digit appears in the string of numbers:   0 appears 1 time, 1 appears 2 times, 2 appears 3 times, 3 appears 4 times, 4 appears 5 times, 5 appears 6 times, and 9 appears 1 time. So, there are 7 digits in total, and each digit appears exactly once in the string of numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many students are there in each class and then calculate the total number of students in all classes together.  So, we need to know the following information:  Number of classes = 102  Number of students per class =? (We don't know this information) Total number of students =? (We want to find out) Now, let's assume that there are 50 students in each class. Therefore, the total number of students in all classes together would be: Total number of students = 102 x 50 = 5100 students. However, if there are fewer than 50 students in each class, the total number of students will be less than 5100. If there are more than 50 students in each class, the total number of students will be greater than 5100.
Response:  We have to find out how many fingers are there in each hand and then multiply it with the number of hands to get the total number of fingers.  So, let's first calculate the number of fingers in each hand.  There are 5 fingers in each hand, so we have 5 x 7 = 35 fingers in both hands together.  Now, we need to divide the total number of fingers by the number of hands to get the average number of fingers per hand.  Therefore, the average number of fingers per hand is 35 / 2 = 17.5 fingers per hand.

Now, we need to find out how many frames are there in each roju. Since there are 3 rojus in one frank, the total number of frames in one frank is 747 / 3 = 249. Therefore, there are 249 frames in each frank.
Response:  We know that there are 66 puja items in total and each item has to be performed for 12 times, so the total number of performances is 66 x 12 = 792. However, we also know that some of these pujas have been already performed before, so let's subtract the number of already performed pujas from the total number of performances. According to the question, 492 rojus (days) have passed since the beginning of the festival, so if we calculate the average number of days per performance, we get 792 / 492 = 1.63 pujas per day. Therefore, there are approximately 1.63 pujas left to perform.

1/18,100 = 0.0000055 (or approximately 0.055%)

So, the probability of selecting one of the 41 alternatives for each of the 450 products is:

0.055% x 450 = 2.375 (or approximately 2.4)

Therefore, the expected number of alternatives selected for each product is:

2.375 x 450 = 1,075 (or approximately 1,080)

So, the answer is 1,075."
Response:  The number of fractions in the first set is 594 and each fraction has 2 parts (i.e., numerator and denominator). Therefore, the total number of parts in the first set is 594 x 2 = 1188. Now, let's consider the second set of fractions. Each fraction in this set has 3 parts (i.e., numerator, denominator, and another part that represents the common denominator between the two fractions). So, the total number of parts in the second set is 607 x 3 = 1821. Finally, we need to find out how many parts are common between the two sets. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of parts in the first set from the number of parts in the second set: 1821 - 1188 = 633. Therefore, there are 633 common parts between the two sets of fractions.
Response:  The number of Franchisees is given as 405 and the total area of land required for each franchisee is 10 cents (0.1 acres). Therefore, the total area of land required for all 405 franchisees would be:  Total Area = Number of Franchisees x Area per Franchisee = 405 x 0.1 = 40.5 acres. Now, let's find out how many hectares are there in an acre. There are 2.47 acres in one hectare. So, we can convert the area in acres to hectares as follows: Hectares = Acres / 2.47 = 40.5 / 2.47 = 16.3 hectares. Therefore, the total area of land required for all 405 franchisees is approximately 16.3 hectares.

Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the 10 digits (0-9) appears in the number 123456789.  The digit '0' appears once in the number, as it is the leading digit.  Therefore, the answer for the first part of the question is 1.  Now, let's move on to the second part of the question.  To find out how many times each of the last 5 digits (8-12) appear in the number, we need to count them separately.  The digit '8' appears twice in the number, as it is present in both 8 and 9.  Similarly, the digit '9' appears thrice in the number, as it is present in all three numbers after 8.  Therefore, the answer for the second part of the question is 2+3=5.  So, the final answer is 1 x 5 = 5.

Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 30 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The first number is 30, which occurs only once in the sequence.  The second number is 29, which occurs twice in the sequence (once as 30 and once as 29).  The third number is 28, which occurs three times in the sequence (twice as 29 and once as 30).  And so on...  Therefore, we can conclude that the total number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 30 in the given sequence is:  30 + 29 x 2 = 780  So, there are 780 occurrences of numbers from 1 to 30 in the given sequence of 30 serial numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each digit (0-9) appears in the given numbers.  The number of digits in each number is as follows:  Number of digits in 79 = 2  Number of digits in 53 = 3  Number of digits in 42 = 2  Now, let's count the number of times each digit appears in each number:  Digit 0 appears once in both 79 and 42, twice in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 0 appears is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Similarly, we can calculate the number of times each digit appears in the other two numbers:  Digit 1 appears once in 79 and thrice in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 1 appears is 1 + 3 = 4. Digit 2 appears twice in 79 and once in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 2 appears is 2 + 1 = 3. Digit 3 appears once in 42 and thrice in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 3 appears is 1 + 3 = 4. Digit 4 appears once in 79 and twice in 42. Therefore, the total number of times digit 4 appears is 2 + 2 = 4. Digit 5 appears once in 53 and thrice in 42. Therefore, the total number of times digit 5 appears is 1 + 3 = 4. Digit 6 appears once in 79 and once in 42. Therefore, the total number of times digit 6 appears is 2. Digit 7 appears once in 79 and once in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 7 appears is 2. Digit 8 appears once in 42 and once in 53. Therefore, the total number of times digit 8 appears is 2. Digit 9 appears once in 79 and once in 42. Therefore, the total number of times digit 9 appears is 2. Finally, we add up all these numbers to get our answer:  Total number of times each digit appears = 4 + 4 + 
Response:  We know that 54 batters faced by David Price resulted in 83 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.67. Now, we need to find out how many runs he allowed per nine innings (R/9). To do this, we will divide his earned runs (ER) by the number of innings pitched (IP): R/9 = ER / IP = 83 / 540 = 0.156 or approximately 1.56 runs per nine innings. Therefore, David Price allowed around 1.56 runs per nine innings during the season.

Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between 19 December and 60 March.  Since 19 December falls on Wednesday, we can count the number of days until the next Wednesday (which is 60 March). So, the total number of days = 60 - 19 = 41 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 72 appears in the sequence of 72 sods and 32 dice rolls.  Since there are 72 sods, each number from 1 to 72 appears once in the sequence of sods. Similarly, since there are 32 dice rolls, each number from 1 to 32 appears once in the sequence of dice rolls. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each number is as follows:  Number Appearances: 1 - 1 2 - 2 3 - 3... 72 - 72 32 - 32 Total Number of Appearances = 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 72 + 32 = 146 So, the answer is 146.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 36 is divisible by 8 and also how many times 54 is divisible by 12.  So, we need to divide both numbers by their respective factors.

"Response:  We have to find out how many days are there between two dates.  The first date is ""ఓక కిరాణా"" which means ""30 days ago"".  So, the date is 30 days before today.  Now, we need to find out what today's date is.  According to the question, today's date is ""ఆ పేజీ చేసింది"".  This can be translated to ""Today is Monday"".  Therefore, today's date is Monday.  Now, let's calculate the difference between the two dates.  There are 7 days in a week, so the difference between Sunday and Monday is 1 day (i.e., 1 day has passed).  Similarly, the difference between Saturday and Friday is also 1 day (i.e., 1 day has passed), and the difference between Thursday and Wednesday is also 1 day (i.e., 1 day has passed).  Therefore, the total number of days that have passed between the two dates is 4 days (i.e., 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4).  Hence, the answer is 4 days."
Response:  We have to find out how many times the digit 4 appears in the number 1234567890. To do this, we need to count the number of digits that are equal to 4.

The second number is 26, which occurs twice in the sequence (as 26 and 32).  The third number is 27, which occurs thrice in the sequence (as 27, 49, and 75).  Therefore, we can conclude that the number 57 appears once, the number 26 appears twice, and the number 27 appears three times in the given sequence of numbers.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 81 appears in the sequence of 60 digits.  Since there are 60 digits in total, we can divide them into groups of 60/5 = 12 groups.  Each group consists of 60/5 = 12 digits.  Now, let's count how many times each number from 1 to 81 appears in these 12 groups:  Number Appearances: 1 - 3 times, 2 - 4 times, 3 - 5 times, 4 - 6 times, 5 - 7 times, 6 - 8 times, 7 - 9 times, 8 - 10 times, 9 - 11 times, and 10 - 12 times. Therefore, the answer is 12 x (number of appearances) = 12 x (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12) = 12 x (91). So, there are 91 occurrences of each number from 1 to 81 in the sequence of 60 digits.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 49 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The first number is 49, which occurs only once in the sequence.

Response:  The number of people who have seen the video is 100 million as mentioned in the question. Now, let's calculate how many times each person has watched it. Since there are 666 million views, and each view is counted as one time, we can assume that each person has watched the video an average of 6.66 times (666/100). So, the total number of times the video has been watched is 6.66 x 100 = 666 million times.
Response:  We know that there are 132 sanctioned posts of Bakimghaham in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Out of these, 40% of the total posts are reserved for BCs, which is 52 posts (132 x 0.4 = 52). So, the number of Bakimghahams who belong to BC category is 52.
"Response:  We know that there are 100 questions in each exam and we have to find out how many questions are asked from each topic.  So, let's assume that the number of questions asked from each topic is represented by a binomial distribution with parameters n = 100 (total number of questions) and p = x (number of questions asked from each topic).  Therefore, the probability of getting y questions from each topic is given by:

P(y) = (100 choose y) * (x/100)^y * (90/100)^(100-y)

Now, we want to find the probability that at least one question is asked from each of the 8 topics.  This can be done using the concept of inclusion-exclusion principle.  The number of sets of at least one question from each of the 8 topics is equal to the number of ways to select at least one question from each of the 8 topics minus the number of ways to select no questions from any of the 8 topics.  Using the binomial distribution, the probability of selecting at least one question from each of the 8 topics is given by:

P(atleastonefromeach) = P(question1) + P(question2) +... + P(question8) - P(noquestionsfromany)

where P(questioni) is the probability of getting at least one question from topic i, which we calculated above.  Now, we need to calculate P(noquestionsfromany), which is the probability of getting no questions from any of the 8 topics.  This can be calculated as follows:

P(noquestionsfromany) = (1/100)^8 = 0.000676

Therefore, the final answer is:

P(atleastonefromeach) = 0.3333 + 0.2727 +... + 0.1438 - 0.000676 = 0.7558

So, the probability that at least one question is asked from each of the 8 topics is approximately 0.7558 or 75.58%."
Response:  We know that there are 71 chakras in the human body according to Hindu mythology. Out of these, 557 are located in the spinal cord and surrounding nerves. So, the number of chakras in the spinal cord and surrounding nerves is 557. Now, let's calculate the number of chakras in each of the 188 rogues mentioned in the question. As per Hindu mythology, each rogue has 3-4 chakras. Therefore, the total number of chakras in all 188 rogues is (3 x 188) = 564. However, as per the question, only 57 rogues have Bakinihams. Therefore, the number of chakras in Bakiniham is (57 / 188) x 564 = 290.
Response:  We know that there are 39 chitras in Bakigaham's palace.  Each chitra has 661 sandalwood trees. So, the total number of sandalwood trees in Bakigaham's palace is: 39 x 661 = 25791 sandalwood trees. Therefore, the answer is 25791.
Response:  We know that there are 92 sandalwood trees in the forest and each tree has 419 branches. So, the total number of branches in all the trees is 92 x 419 = 38,568 branches. Now, we need to find out how many of these branches have been cut down. The question states that 419 branches have been cut down, which means that 419 / 38,568 = 0.107% of the total branches have been cut down. Therefore, the answer is 0.107%.
Response:  We know that there are 512 samples in each batch of Bakhingham's algorithm and we have to find out how many batches can be formed using 89 samples.  To do this, we need to divide 89 by 512.  When we divide 89 by 512, we get an integer quotient of 16 with a remainder of 32. So, we can form 16 batches of 512 samples each using 89 samples.
Response:  We know that there are 705 sandalwood trees in the forest and each tree has 191 branches with 457 leaves per branch. So, the total number of leaves in all the branches is 705 x 191 = 136,891. However, out of these, only 245 leaves are from the 100 trees that belong to Bakiganga. Therefore, the number of leaves belonging to Bakiganga is 245.
Response:  We know that there are 159 grams of salt in one cup. So, if we have to calculate how many cups of salt are required to make 628 grams of salt, we can divide 628 grams by 159 grams per cup.

Response:  We have to find out how many grams of each type of sugar are present in 1 cup (250 ml) of chocolate milk.  From the given information, we know that there are 49 grams of carbohydrates and 288 calories in 1 cup of chocolate milk.  Therefore, the total number of grams of carbohydrates in 1 cup of chocolate milk is 49 x 4 = 196 grams.  Since there are 4 types of sugars - glucose, fructose, galactose, and lactose - present in chocolate milk, their respective amounts can be calculated as follows: Glucose: 13.7% of total carbohydrates = 196 / 13.7 = 14.5 grams Fructose: 2.4% of total carbohydrates = 196 / 2.4 = 8 grams Galactose: 6.7% of total carbohydrates = 196 / 6.7 = 14 grams Lactose: 68.6% of total carbohydrates = 196 / 68.6 = 28 grams So, the total amount of sugar in 1 cup of chocolate milk is 14 + 8 + 14 + 28 = 64 grams.

1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 19, 23, 28,... (term 56)

As you can see, the term 28 appears only once in the first 56 terms of the sequence. Therefore, the answer is 1."
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 50 appears in the series of numbers given in the question.  The series is: 53, 57, 62, 68, 75,... (and so on).  To find out how many times each number appears, we can count the number of occurrences of each number in the series.  For example, the number 53 occurs once in the series, because it is the first number after the starting point of the series (which is assumed to be 0). Similarly, the number 62 occurs twice in the series, because it comes after 57 and before 75.  Therefore, the answer to the question is:  Number of times each number from 1 to 50 appears in the series: 1 - 53 = 52 times 2 - 57 = 55 times 3 - 62 = 58 times 4 - 68 = 61 times 5 - 75 = 64 times 6 - 83 = 67 times 7 - 91 = 70 times 8 - 100 = 73 times 9 - 118 = 76 times 10 - 136 = 79 times 11 - 164 = 82 times 12 - 193 = 85 times 13 - 225 = 88 times 14 - 267 = 91 times 15 - 309 = 94 times 16 - 377 = 97 times 17 - 457 = 100 times 18 - 547 = 103 times 19 - 633 = 106 times 20 - 729 = 109 times 21 - 833 = 112 times 22 - 967 = 115 times 23 - 1033 = 118 times 24 - 1127 = 121 times 25 - 1223 = 124 times 26
"Response:  We have to find out how many times the digit 5 appears in the number 51. To do this, we need to count the number of digits in the number 51 and then check if each digit is equal to 5.  The number of digits in 51 is 3. So, let's count the number of digits that are equal to 5:

Response:  We know that there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and each letter has 3 forms ( uppercase, lowercase, and title case). So, we have a total of 26 x 3 = 78 forms for each word. Now, let's assume that you can remember all these 78 forms for each word. The number of words you can memorize is equal to the product of the number of letters in the word and the number of forms it has. Therefore, if a word has 5 letters, you can memorize 5 x 78 = 390 words. Similarly, if a word has 15 letters, you can memorize 15 x 78 = 1170 words. Finally, if a word has 52 letters, you can memorize 52 x 78 = 4032 words. So, the maximum number of words you can memorize depends on the length of the words you want to learn.

Response:  We have to find out how many rebecks are there in total and then calculate the number of groups they can be divided into based on their size.  So, let's start with finding out the total number of rebecks.  According to the question, there are 18 rebecks in total, each containing 72 artisans.  Therefore, the total number of artisans is 18 x 72 = 1304.  Now, we need to divide this number by 6 to get the number of groups that can be formed.  So, the number of groups that can be formed is 1304 / 6 = 217 groups.
Response:  We have to find out how many rebecks are there in total and then divide it by 100 to get the average number of rebecs per group.  So, let's calculate the total number of rebecs first. From the question, we know that there are 99 arttis with 9 groups each, which means there are 9 x 9 = 81 groups in total. And from the same question, we know that each group has 27 gudlus, which means there are 81 x 27 = 2167 gudlus in total. Now, we need to convert these gudlus into rebecs. As we know, one gudlu is equal to 4 rebecs, so we can multiply 2167 gudlus by 4 to get the total number of rebecs: 2167 x 4 = 8668 rebecs. Finally, to get the average number of rebecs per group, we just divide the total number of rebecs by the number of groups: 8668 / 81 = 105.56 rebecs per group on average.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times Rebecca can repeat each of her 20 words in order to use all 6 slots for each word.  Since there are 6 slots available for each word, we need to divide the number of words by 6 to get the number of repetitions required for each word.  So, the total number of repetitions required is:

$$ \text{Total Repetitions} = \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Slots}} $$

In this case, the number of words is 20 and the number of slots is 6, so the total number of repetitions required is:

$$ \text{Total Repetitions} = \frac{20}{6} = 3.33 \times 10^3 $$

Therefore, Rebecca needs to repeat each of her 20 words approximately 3333 times in order to fill up all 6 slots for each word."

So, we need to divide 20 by 5 to get the number of groups.  Then, we can multiply that number by 5 to get the total number of rebecks.  Therefore, the answer is: Total Number of Rebecks = (Number of Groups / 5) x 5 = 40 x 5 = 200.
Response:  We know that there are 154 trips in total and we have to cover them within 20 days. So, each trip will take approximately 7.7 days (154/20). Now, let's consider how many round trips can be made in one day. Since we need to return back to Hyderabad after completing each trip, it takes half a day for traveling from Hyderabad to Tirupati and returning back. Therefore, we can make only 3-4 round trips per day (half a day x 3 = 1.5 days). Now, let's calculate the number of days required to complete all 154 trips: Total number of days = Number of round trips x Time taken for each round trip = 3-4 x 7.7 = 23-31 days. Therefore, you would require at least 23-31 days to complete all 154 trips assuming you make 3-4 round trips per day.

Therefore, the answer is 2240 rods.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each of the numbers from 1 to 32 appears in the series.  Since there are 32 numbers in total, we can divide them into groups of 4 based on their multiples of 8.  The first group consists of the numbers that are divisible by 8 (i.e., 8, 16, 24, and 32).  There are 4 such numbers in this group.  The second group consists of the numbers that are not divisible by 8 but are divisible by 4 (i.e., 4, 12, 20, and 28).  There are also 4 such numbers in this group.  Therefore, the total number of appearances of each number in the series is: Group 1: 4 x 4 = 16 Group 2: 4 x 4 = 16 So, the answer is 16 + 16 = 32.

128 puffs/day x 30 years (her age) = 3840 puffs/year

So, Emily has taken approximately 3840 puffs every year for 30 years, which means she has taken a total of:

3840 puffs/year x 30 years = 115,200 puffs in her entire life

Therefore, the answer to the question is 115,200 puffs."
Response:  We know that there are 18 necks in total and we have to choose 6 of them for the poll. So, the probability of each neck being chosen is 1/3. Now, let's calculate the probability of each option (A, B, C) being true. Option A states that all the 6 chosen necks will be from the same group. Since there are 6 groups, the probability of this happening is (1/6) × (5/6)^5 = 1/64. Options B and C state that at least one neck from each group will be chosen, respectively. The probability of at least one neck from each group being chosen is (5/6) × (4/6)^4 = 1/8 and (4/6) × (3/6)^3 = 1/24, respectively. Therefore, the overall probability of any of these options being true is 1/64 + 1/8 + 1/24 = 1/109.
Response:  We have to find out how many puffs are there in each pack of Emily cigarettes and then multiply it with the number of packs she smokes per day.  So, we need to know the following information:  How many puffs are there in one pack of Emily cigarettes?  How many packs does Emily smoke per day?  Once we have this information, we can calculate the total number of puffs Emily takes per day as follows: Total number of puffs = Number of puffs/pack x Number of packs/day Now, let's apply the formula based on the given information: Total number of puffs = 10 puffs/pack x 4 packs/day = 40 puffs/day Therefore, Emily takes 40 puffs per day on average.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 72 appears in the series of numbers given in the question.  The series is: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  To count the number of times each number appears, we can use the following formula: Number of appearances = Total number of terms / Term that appears most frequently. In this case, the total number of terms is 72, and the term that appears most frequently is 6, which appears 10 times (6 x 10/72). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number from 1 to 20 appears in the list of 43 numbers.  Since there are 7 numbers between 1 and 5, we can expect 7 x 5 = 35 numbers between 1 and 5. Similarly, since there are 6 numbers between 5 and 10, we can expect 6 x 5 = 30 numbers between 5 and 10. And so on... So, the total number of numbers that appear in the list is: 35 + 30 +... + 10 + 5 = 185. Therefore, the probability of getting any particular number among these 43 numbers is 1/185.
"Response:  We know that Emily is 44 years old and has 26 necks. If we assume that each neck takes 10 minutes to massage, then the total time required for Emily's massage would be:

Now, Adham has 6 apples left, which he can distribute among the remaining 3 friends. So, each friend will get 2 apples (6/3 = 2). Therefore, the final distribution is:  Adham - 2 apples; Friend 1 - 2 apples; Friend 2 - 2 apples; Friend 3 - 2 apples."
Response:  We know that there are 89 jackets in total and each jacket has 5 pockets. So, the number of pockets we have is 89 x 5 = 445 pockets. Now, out of these 445 pockets, 11 are empty. Therefore, the number of non-empty pockets is 445 - 11 = 434 pockets.
Response:  We know that there are 31 days in March and April together. So, if we multiply 31 with 270, we get 8670. Now, let's subtract 419 from this number to find out how many days are left after deducting the number of days in March alone. Therefore, the remaining days are 8251.
Response:  We know that there are 90 chakras in the human body according to Hindu mythology. Out of these, 51 are located in the head and neck region. So, if we calculate the number of chakras per square centimeter for this region, we get: Number of chakras / Total area of head and neck = 51 / (Area of head + Area of neck) Now, let's find the areas of the head and neck. The average size of an adult human skull is approximately 23 cm x 17 cm (source: Wikipedia). Therefore, the area of the head can be calculated as follows: Area of head = π x (23 cm)^2 = 676.8 cm^2 Similarly, the area of the neck can also be calculated using its average length and circumference. According to one source (source: Healthline), the average length of the human neck is approximately 45 cm, while the average circumference is around 38 cm. Using these values, we can calculate the area of the neck as follows: Area of neck = π x (45 cm)^2 = 217.5 cm^2 Now, let's put everything together: Number of chakras per square centimeter = 51 / (676.8 cm^2 + 217.5 cm^2) = 0.074 chakras/cm^2 This means that there are approximately 0.074 chakras per square centimeter in the head and neck region of the human body based on Hindu mythology.
"Response:  We know that there are 527 chakles in one hectare of land.  If we want to calculate how many hectares of land can be cultivated with 86 rotti... (читайте далее)

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that there are 527 chakles in one hectare of land.  If we want to calculate how many hectares of land can be cultivated with 86 rottis, we need to divide the number of rottis by the number of chakles in one hectare. So, we have:

Number of hectares = Number of rottis / Number of chakles in one hectare
= 86 / 527
= 0.16 or approximately 1/6 of a hectare

Therefore, approximately 1/6 of a hectare of land can be cultivated with 86 rottis."
"Response:  We know that there are 144 chakras in the human body and each chakra has 360 degrees of rotation. So, the total number of degrees of rotation for all the chakras is:

144 x 360 = 52,880 degrees

Now, we need to calculate the number of revolutions that each chakra makes in one hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

52,880 / 24 = 2,160 revolutions per day

Finally, we can calculate the total number of revolutions made by all the chakras in one year as follows:

2,160 x 365 = 766,560 revolutions per year

So, the answer to the question is 766,560 revolutions per year."
Response:  We know that there are 19 chakras in the human body and each chakra has 4 levels or dimensions. So, we have 19 x 4 = 76 total levels of consciousness in the human body. Now, let's assume that each level of consciousness is represented by one helix. Therefore, we have 76 helices representing the different levels of consciousness in the human body. However, as per the question, only 231 helices are present in the human body. This means that some of the levels of consciousness are missing or not fully developed. In other words, the number of helices representing the different levels of consciousness in the human body is less than the actual number of levels of consciousness. Therefore, the answer to the question is 231 - 76 = 155.
Response:  We know that there are 197 chaklots in one hectare of land.  If we divide this number by 4, we get 50 chaklots per rotti (a unit of measurement for land).  So, if we have 75 rotters of land, then the total number of chaklots will be 75 x 50 = 3750 chaklots.  Now, let's calculate the number of crop cycles.  Since each chaklot can produce only one crop cycle, we need to divide the total number of chaklots by the number of crops that can be produced in one hectare of land in a year.  According to the question, it is mentioned that 46 rotters of land are under cultivation, and each rotter can produce 2-3 crops in a year.  Therefore, the total number of crops that can be produced in one hectare of land in a year is 46 x 2-3 = 9-18 crops.  So, the number of crop cycles in one hectare of land in a year is 3750 / 9 = 411.5 crop cycles per year.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the number 519 appears in the given sequence of numbers. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of 519 in the sequence.

Response:  We know that 91 - 88 = 3. So, there are 3 more diamonds in the box than the number of gems in the bag. Now, we need to find out how many gems are in the bag. From the question, we know that there are 53 gems in the bag. Therefore, the final answer is 3 + 53 = 56.
Response:  We have to find out how many total gems are there in the box and then calculate the percentage of emeralds among them.  So, let's start with the given information:  There are 78 kitty cat-shaped gemstones and 86 paw-shaped gemstones in the box.  Therefore, the total number of gemstones in the box is:  Total gemstones = 78 + 86 = 164 gemstones Now, we need to find out how many emeralds are there among these gemstones.  According to the question, there are 48 emeralds among these gemstones.  Therefore, the percentage of emeralds among all gemstones is:  Percentage of emeralds = Number of emeralds / Total gemstones x 100%  = 48/164 x 100% = 29% So, there are approximately 29% emeralds among the total gemstones in the box.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 84 cats can be divided into groups of 19 cats each. To do this, we need to divide 84 by 19. So, the number of times 84 cats can be divided into groups of 19 cats each is:

So, the answer is 4."
Response:  We have to find out how many times 62 is divisible by 80 and also how many times 73 is divisible by 41.  So we can write : 62 / 80 = x where x is an integer, since 62 is exactly divisible by 80 once. Similarly, we can write : 73 / 41 = y where y is an integer, since 73 is exactly divisible by 41 twice. Now we need to find out how many times x and y are equal. So let's equate x and y as follows : x = y  Now we can solve for x and y using these equations : x + y = 2 (since there are two instances of division)  Substituting x = y from above equation in this one, we get 2y = 2  Solving for y, we get y = 1  Therefore, x = y = 1. So the number of times 62 is divisible by 80 is 1 and the number of times 73 is divisible by 41 is also 1.
Response:  We know that there are 57 weeks in a year and each week has 7 days. So, we have 57 x 7 = 409 days in a year. Now, let's calculate how many months it takes to save $63 dollars per month for 12 years.  We know that there are 12 x 12 = 144 months in 12 years. Therefore, it will take approximately 409 / 144 = 2.8 years to save $63 dollars per month for 12 years.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 57 appears in the given sequence of numbers.  The sequence starts with 57 and then there are 39 consecutive numbers after that. So, the total number of appearances of 57 in the sequence is 57 + 39 = 96. Now, we need to subtract the number of appearances of 34 from the total number of appearances of 57. Therefore, the answer is 96 - 34 = 62.
"Response:  We know that there are 60 days in March and June has 30 days. So, we have to calculate how many days are left after subtracting the number of days in March from the total number of days in June.  Therefore, the difference between the number of days in June and March is:

June - March = 30 (days) + 27 (days) = 57 days

So, there are 57 days left in June after deducting the number of days in March."
Response:  We know that there are 10 cars in total (including both the Ford F-86 and Toyota Corolla).  Out of these, 3 cars belong to Mr. Reddy (i.e., 3/10 = 0.3 or 30%).  Therefore, the number of cars owned by Mr. Reddy is 0.3 x 10 = 3. So, Mr. Reddy owns 3 cars.
Response:  We know that there are 30 days in April and May combined (April has 30 days and May has 31 days). So, we can say that there are 30 + 31 = 61 days in total between February 19th and June 16th. Now, let's calculate the number of Fridays between these dates:  There are 7 Fridays in April (from April 8th to April 28th), 5 Fridays in May (from May 5th to May 26th), and 1 Friday in June (on June 17th). Therefore, the total number of Fridays between February 19th and June 16th is: 7 + 5 + 1 = 13 Fridays.
"Response:  We know that there are 114 Fridays in a year and each Friday has 22 days. So, the total number of Fridays in a year is:

So, there are $ 71$ more freight trains than passenger trains passing through the station."
Response:  We know that there are 49 farmers who have committed suicide in Andhra Pradesh due to crop failure. Out of these, 112 families were affected, and each family had an average of 5 members. So, the total number of people affected is 112 x 5 = 560. Now, we need to calculate the percentage of people who are women. According to the information provided, out of the 560 people affected, 37% are women. Therefore, the percentage of women among the affected families is (37/100) x 100 = 37%.
Response:  We know that there are 78 freight trains and 31 passenger trains per day in total.  Of these, 14 freight trains have 5 wagons each, while 90 passenger trains have an average of 2 coaches each (including the engine). Therefore, we can calculate the number of wagons or coaches as follows:  Wagons: Total number of freight trains x Number of wagons per train = 78 x 5 = 390 wagons Passenger coaches: Total number of passenger trains x Average number of coaches per train = 31 x 2 = 62 coaches So, there are approximately 390 wagons and 62 coaches in total.
Response:  We know that there are 33 freight trains and 95 passenger trains in total.  Among them, 16 freight trains have 74 coaches each, which means they have a total of 1208 coaches (16 x 74 = 1208). So, the number of coaches in all the freight trains is 1208.
Response:  We know that there are 47 freight trains and 99 passenger trains in total.  Among them, 111 freight trains have 1 coach each, and among these, 34 freight trains have only one coach. So, the number of freight trains with at least one coach is 111 - 34 = 77. Therefore, the answer is 77.
"Response:  We know that 365 days are in a year and each day has 24 hours. So, we can calculate the number of hours in a year as follows:

Number of bags = Total weight / Weight per bag
= 114 kg / 50 kg (or) 60 kg
= 2 or 3 bags
Therefore, we need either 2 or 3 bags to pack 114 kilos of rice, depending on whether we use 50 kilos or 60 kilos per bag."
Response:  The number of jesses in 9 kills is 9 x 6 = 54 jesses. Since each jesse has 3 claws, the total number of claws in 54 jesses is 54 x 3 = 162 claws. Therefore, the number of barrows in 162 claws is 162 / 3 = 54 barrows. So, there are 54 barrows in one jess.
Response:  We know that there are 92 kilos in 1 ton. So, if we divide 56 kilos by 92, we get 0.6 (or approximately 60%). Therefore, out of 100 kilograms, 60% or 60 kilograms is equal to 56 kilograms. Hence, the remaining 44 kilograms is equal to 99 kilograms.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  In this case, we have 95 numbers and 61 numbers. So, the total number of pairs is:  Number of pairs = Total number of numbers / 2 = 95 / 2 = 47.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, the exact number of pairs is 47 pairs.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  The set consists of 93 odd numbers and 97 even numbers.  So, we can say that each number is paired with its opposite (i.e., odd or even) number. Therefore, the total number of pairs = Total number of odd numbers + Total number of even numbers - Number of identical pairs.  Now, let's calculate these quantities:  Total number of odd numbers = 93 Total number of even numbers = 97 Number of identical pairs = 0 (Since all the numbers are distinct) Therefore, the total number of pairs = 93 + 97 - 0 = 186 pairs.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  In this case, we have three numbers - 30, 40 and 60.  So, we can make three pairs of numbers from these three numbers.  Therefore, the number of pairs of numbers is 3.  Now, let's count the number of triples of numbers among these pairs.  From each pair, we can make two triples (one with the first number and one with the second number).  So, the total number of triples of numbers is also 3.  Finally, we need to subtract the number of triples of numbers from the total number of pairs of numbers to get the remaining single numbers.  Therefore, the answer is 82 - 3 = 79.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  The set of numbers is {30, 24, 18, 12, 6}.  To find the number of pairs, we need to divide the total number of numbers by 2. So, the number of pairs is:  Total number of numbers = 5 (since there are 5 numbers in the set)  Number of pairs = Total number of numbers / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2 and half pairs. Therefore, there are 2 and half pairs of numbers in the given set of numbers.
Response:  We know that there are 171 tamarind trees in the area and we have to count how many of them are fruitful. So, the number of fruitful tamarind trees is 134 (as mentioned in the question). Now, out of these 134 fruitful trees, 30 of them are not bearing fruits. So, the number of fruitful tamarind trees after excluding the non-bearing ones is 104 (134 - 30 = 104).
Response:  We have to find out how many times 160 is divisible by 56 and 41.  So, we need to divide both numbers by 56 and 41 separately.  When we divide 160 by 56, we get 2 with remainder 32.  Similarly, when we divide 160 by 41, we get 3 with remainder 19. Therefore, the number of times 160 is divisible by 56 and 41 is 2 x 3 = 6.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 90 is divisible by 154 and then multiply it with 50. So, we need to divide 90 by 154 which gives us 0.602. Now, if we multiply 0.602 with 50, we get 30.1. Therefore, there are 30 toilets in the building.
Response:  We have to find out how many times 175 is divisible by 77 and also how many times 172 is divisible by 77.  So, we need to divide both numbers by 77.

Response:  We have to find out how many gears are there in total and then divide it by 2 to get the number of gears that can be used for each speed range.  So, let's count the total number of gears first. From the given information, we know that there are 15 speeds in total, ranging from 0 to 14. Now, let's see how many gears are available at each speed level:  At low speeds (0-3), there are 7 gears available. At medium speeds (4-6), there are 5 gears available. And at high speeds (7-14), there are 3 gears available. Therefore, the total number of gears is: 7 + 5 + 3 = 15 gears. Now, dividing it by 2 gives us the number of gears that can be used for each speed range: 15 / 2 = 7.5 gears per speed range. So, there are approximately 7.5 gears available for each speed range.
Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 2 appears in the given series of numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99.

Response:  We know that there are 43 people in Rabin's team and out of them, 23 have already received their salaries. So, the number of people who haven't received their salaries is 43 - 23 = 20. Now, we need to find out how many of these 20 people have not received their salary for more than 8 months. To do this, we will divide the number of people who haven't received their salary (20) by the number of months they haven't received their salary (8). So, the number of people who haven't received their salary for more than 8 months is 20 / 8 = 5. Therefore, 5 people have not received their salary for more than 8 months.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, the total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours Rabin spent on his hobby during these 7 days. According to the question, he spent 41 hours on his hobby in one day, which means he spent (41/7) x 7 = 59 hours on his hobby in a week. Therefore, the answer is 59 hours.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of letters are there in each word and then multiply it with the total number of words.  For example, if we take the first word ""Rabindranath"", there are 5 pairs of letters ( R-a, A-b, b-d, d-n, n-t ). If we multiply it with the total number of letters in that word which is 9, we get 45. Similarly for other words also. So the final answer will be : Total number of pairs of letters = Number of words x Number of pairs of letters per word. Therefore, the answer is 45."
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of rabbits can be formed using 21 white rabbits and 45 black rabbits.  Since there are 9 white rabbits in total, each pair of white rabbits will have one black rabbit as its partner. Therefore, we need to divide 45 (black rabbits) by 3 (number of white rabbits per pair). So, the number of pairs of rabbits that can be formed is: 45 / 3 = 15 pairs.
"Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of rabbits can be formed using 28 female rabbits and 14 male rabbits.  To do this, we need to use the concept of ""pairs"" in combinatorics.  A pair is defined as two elements that are related in some way (e.g., husband and wife).  In our case, we want to form pairs of rabbits - one male and one female.  So, we count the number of ways to form these pairs from the given set of rabbits.  There are 28 females, so there are 28 possible partners for each male rabbit.  Since there are 14 males, there are 14 x 28 = 376 possible pairs of rabbits.  Therefore, the answer is 376."

Response:  We know that there are 9 chocolates in total and we want to distribute them equally among 4 people. So, each person will get 9/4 = 2.25 chocolates per person. Now, let's consider the remaining 3 chocolates. Since there are 4 people, we can give 1 chocolate to each of them, so the number of chocolates left is 3. Therefore, the final answer is 2.25 + 1 = 3.25 chocolates per person.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number appears in the given series of numbers.  The first three numbers are 1, 2, and 3. Each of these numbers appears once in the series.  Next comes the number 4, which appears twice in the series (once as 4 and once as 16). Then there is the number 5, which appears thrice in the series (twice as 5 and once as 25). Similarly, we can count the appearances of other numbers in the series. Therefore, the total number of times each number appears in the series is:  Number Appearances 1 - 3 2 - 4 3 - 5 4 - 7 5 - 9  Total = 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 20 So, there are 20 numbers in the series.
Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are there in total and then we will get the number of multiples of each digit. So, let's count the digits first. The given string has 9 digits. Now, we need to find out how many times each digit appears in the string. For this, we will use the concept of digital root. Digital Root is defined as the sum of all the digits in a number, which is then reduced to a single-digit number. In this case, the digital root of the given string is 3 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 19, which reduces to 1 when we take its digital root. Therefore, the number of appearances of each digit in the given string is as follows: 0 - 1 time, 1 - 3 times, 2 - 2 times, 3 - 1 time, 4 - 2 times, 5 - 1 time, 6 - 0 times (as it does not appear at all). Now that we know the number of appearances of each digit, we can calculate the number of multiples of each digit as follows:  Number of multiples of 0 = 1, since there is only one occurrence of 0 in the given string. Number of multiples of 1 = 3 x 1 = 3, since there are three occurrences of 1 in the given string. Number of multiples of 2 = 2 x 2 = 4, since there are two occurrences of 2 in the given string. Number of multiples of 3 = 1 x 1 = 1, since there is only one occurrence of 3 in the given string. Number of multiples of 4 = 2 x 2 = 4, since there are two occurrences of 4 in the given string. Number of multiples of 5 = 1 x 1 = 1, since there is only one occurrence of 5 in the given string. Number of multiples of 6 = 0, since there are no occurrences of 6 in the given string. Finally, we can conclude that there are 1 multiples of each digit in the given string.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers are there in the given set of numbers.  The set of numbers is {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.

"Response:  We have to find out how many times the number 4 appears in the given series of numbers: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,... (the series is not complete).  To do this, we can count the number of digits in each number and see if they are multiples of 4.  Here are the counts:

* Number of digits in each number = length of the number / 10 (since there are 10 digits in each number)
* Count of multiples of 4 among these numbers = total number of digits / 4 (since there are as many multiples of 4 as there are digits in each number)

Now, let's calculate the total number of multiples of 4 in the series:

Total number of multiples of 4 = sum of all counts of multiples of 4
= sum of lengths of all numbers in the series
= 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 + 24 +... (the series is not complete)

So, there are 5 multiples of 4 in the series: 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20. Therefore, the answer is 5."

# Initialize a list to store the counts
counts = [0] * 10

# Loop through each digit from 0 to 9
for i in range(10):
    # Calculate the lower and upper bounds for the current digit
    low_digit = low % 10
    high_digit = high % 10
    
    # Print the count for the current digit
    print(f""Digit {i} appears {low_digit + high_digit - 1} times"")
    
    # Increment the count for the current digit
    counts[i] += (low_digit + high_digit - 1)

print(""Total number of appearances:"", sum(counts))
