"Response: 9 (piros) + 5 (sárga) = 14
Question: A három színű barackok közötti aránya a következő: 3:2:2. Hogyan oldja meg ezt az arányt 6 db-ra?  
Answer: To find out how to distribute 6 baracks among three colors with an ratio of 3:2:2, we can use division. We divide 6 by the number of each color in the ratio: 6 / 3 = 2, 6 / 2 = 3, and 6 / 2 = 3. So there will be 2 red, 3 green, and 3 blue baracks."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are 6 zöldek and 14 sárgák in the basket. Since there are more sárgák than zöldekkel, we know that the number of zöldeket is less than half of the total number of baracks in the basket. Therefore, the number of zöldeket is 3."

Response: 6 zöld barack
Response: 2 kosárok barackot tartalmaznak.
"Response: 3
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x zöld baracks in each of the two baskets. Since there are 4 red apples in each basket and total number of apples is 12, we can write the equation:

x + 4 = 12... (1)

Since there are 2 baskets, the total number of apples is twice the number of apples in one basket:

x + 8 = 24... (2)

Now, we can solve for x using either equation (1) or (2):

x = 6

So, there are 6 zöld baracks in each basket."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 16 bars in total and 13 of them are red. Since there are still some green bars left, we can assume that there must be at least as many green bars as red bars. Therefore, the number of green bars is equal to the number of red bars minus the number of red bars already counted (i.e., 13). So, there are 13 - 13 = 0 green bars in the basket."
Response:  There are 75 baracks in total (19 x 15 = 285).
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 10 baracks in total and they are equally distributed among some baskets. Since each basket contains 4 red and 6 green baracks, there must be 5 baskets in total (since 4 x 5 = 20 and 6 x 5 = 30). Therefore, there are 5 barackkosárok (baskets) in total."
"Response: 4
Explanation: The total number of baracks in the basket is 6 + 60 = 66. Since there are 2 red apples, there are 66 - 2 = 64 green apples. Therefore, there are 4 green apples for every red apple (i.e., 4 green apples per red apple)."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 19 golf balls and lost 4 of them on the playground. Therefore, Ed has 15 golf balls left (19 - 4 = 15). Since Doug has fewer golf balls than Ed, Doug must have lost at least 4 golf balls as well. So, the difference between the number of golf balls Ed has and Doug's is 8 (Ed has 15 golf balls, while Doug has 8 golf balls), which means that Ed lost 4 golf balls."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 30 more golf balls than Doug. If Ed had 91 golf balls and lost 21 on the playground, then he had 70 golf balls left (91 - 21 = 70). Since Doug had fewer golf balls than Ed, if Ed had 70 golf balls more than Doug, then Doug had 70 / 2 = 35 golf balls. Therefore, there were 41 golf balls difference between Ed's total and Doug's total (Ed's total - Doug's total = 70 - 35 = 35)."
"Response: 13
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 12 golf balls more than Doug. If Ed lost 4 golf balls (20 - 12 = 8), then he has 8 golf balls left. Since Doug had 17 golf balls initially, and Ed lost 4 golf balls, Doug now has 17 + 8 = 25 golf balls."

* Egér: 35 hüvelyk (10.7 m)

Therefore, the béka jumped 20 hüvelyk (6.1 m), which is the distance between its starting point and the finish line."
Response:  The egernumber of jumps = (béka number of jumps) - (szúnyó number of jumps). So in this case, the egnumber of jumps is 12 - 19 = -7. Therefore, the egernumber of jumps is negative 7.

Solution: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jake has 13 almonds and fewer than 17 walnuts than Steven. Steven has 8 walnuts and 12 almonds.
We can start by finding out how many walnuts Steven has:
Steven has 8 walnuts + 12 almonds = 20 nuts (walnuts or almonds)
Now, we know that Jake has 13 almonds less than Steven:
Jake has 13 - 12 = 1 almond less than Steven
So, Jake has 20 - 1 = 19 nuts (walnuts or almonds).
Therefore, Jake has 19 almonds."
Response: 4 more barrels (Jake has 8 - 4 = 4 more barrels than Steven).
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steven has 19 almonds and 15 baracks. If Jake has 3 fewer baracks than Steven, then Jake has 18 baracks (since 3 is subtracted from 19). Therefore, the number of almonds that Steven has is equal to the number of baracks that Jake has minus the number of almonds that Steven has, which is 18 - 19 = -1. So, Steven has -1 almond more than Jake."

Explanation:
Nell had 309 baseball cards initially and gave 356 of them to Jeff. So, Nell has 309 - 356 = 73 baseball cards left.
Jeff now has 415 + 149 = 564 baseball cards.
To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of cards Jeff has from the number of cards Nell has:
73 (Nell's remaining cards) - 564 (Jeff's total cards) = -491
Since negative numbers indicate a difference, Nell has 491 fewer baseball cards than Jeff. Therefore, the answer is 491."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 246 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card packages remaining. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packages, we can subtract the number of ten-card packages from the total number of baseball cards: 404 - 495 = -91. Since negative numbers indicate a difference between two quantities, Nell has 91 fewer baseball cards than ten-card packages. Therefore, the difference between the number of baseball cards and ten-card packages is 91."

"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 438 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, she has 178 baseball cards left and 55 ten-card sets. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card sets, we can subtract the number of ten-card sets from the total number of baseball cards: 178 - 55 = 123. So, Nell has 26 more baseball cards than ten-card sets."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card sets. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, which reduced her total number of cards by 376 (the number of cards she gave to Jeff). After giving away the cards, Nell was left with 111 baseball cards and 376 ten-card sets. To find out how many more ten-card sets Nell has than baseball cards, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of ten-card sets: 376 - 111 = 265. Since ten-card sets have 10 cards each, this means that Nell has 265 x 10 = 2650 more ten-card sets than baseball cards. Therefore, the difference between the number of ten-card sets and baseball cards is 2650."

Therefore, there are still 20 more books in the series that have not been read or watched."
"Response: 61 films are in the series ""Bolond, Bolond Iskola"" based on the books."
"Response: 9
Explanation: If there are 10 books and 11 films in the series, then you have read 1 book for every 11 films you have watched (since you mentioned reading 13 books). Therefore, you have read 9 books total."
Response: 4 (or 3) films out of 17 have been read in the books.
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, you have read 8 books from the series ""Fool, Fool School"". This means that there are still 6 books left in the series that you haven't read yet."
"Response: 15
Explanation: If you have read 4 books and watched 34 movies from the series, that means you have seen 34 / 4 = 8 films per book. Therefore, to find out how many books you still need to read, divide the number of movies you haven't seen (34 - 4 = 30) by the number of movies per book (8): 30 / 8 = 4. So, you still need to read 4 more books."
Response: 6 films.
Response: 23 (15 books - 11 books you have read = 23 books left)
"Response: 50 films are in the series ""Bolond, Bolond Iskola""."
Response: 3 (the number of books that have been adapted into films)
"Response: 9/16 = 0.5625 or approximately 1/2

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Number of books read = 8
Number of films watched = 19
Ratio of films to books = Number of films / Number of books = 19 / 8 = 2.375
Since we are asked for the fraction of films read compared to the number of books read, we need to divide the number of films by the number of books: 2.375 ÷ 8 = 0.5625 or approximately 1/2. Therefore, the person has watched approximately half of the films in relation to the number of books they have read."

"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, Jesse's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length. In this case, 12 - 11 = 1, so Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide."
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is 4 meters.
Response: 4 meters
Response: 12 square meters. Explanation: The length of the room is 3 meters and its width is also 3 meters, so the area of the room is 9 square meters (length x width). Since there are already 5 square meters of carpet covering the floor, we need an additional 4 square meters to cover the entire floor (9 - 5 = 4). Therefore, Jessie needs 12 square meters of carpet to cover the entire floor.
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide, which means it has an area of 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Since each cement block covers four square meters, we need 24 / 4 = 6 blocks to cover the entire floor. Therefore, there are 6 blocks needed to cover the entire floor."
"Response: 180 square meters (m²)
Explanation: To calculate the amount of carpet needed to cover all 20 rooms, we need to multiply the length and width of each room. Since each room is 6 m long and 6 m wide, the total area of one room is 6 x 6 = 36 m². Therefore, the total area of all 20 rooms is 36 m² x 20 = 720 m². However, since we are asked for the area in square meters (m²), we convert this value from square feet by dividing it by 10.94 (since there are approximately 10.94 square feet in one square meter). So, the answer is 720 m² / 10.94 = 65.35 m²."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 6 meters longer than its width, so if the width is x meters, then the length is x + 6 meters.
Response:  The width of the room is 3 meters.
Response:  The length of the room is 8 meters (26 feet).
"Response: 16 square meters
Explanation: To determine how much carpet is needed to cover the entire floor, we need to calculate the area of the room. The room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide, so its length times width is 80 square feet (4 x 20 = 80). Since Jessene has a four-square-meter piece of carpet, she will need 80/4 = 20 pieces of carpet to cover the entire floor. Each piece of carpet covers an area of 4 square meters, so in total, Jessene needs 20 x 4 = 80 square meters of carpet."
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if the Razorback polo store sold $23 for every polo shirt sold and made $230 from selling polos during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game, then they sold 15 polo shirts during the game. To calculate this, we can use the following equation: Number of polo shirts = Total amount earned / Price per polo shirt. In this case, the total amount earned was $230, and the price per polo shirt is $23, so we can plug these values into the equation to get 15 as our answer."
Response:  $51 / 3 = $17 per polo shirt.
"Response: 136 dollars
Explanation:
The total number of polo shirts sold is given as 95. If the Razorback pólóbolt charges $87 for each polo shirt, then the total amount of money earned from selling polo shirts is:

95 x $87 = $8,425

Since the Arkansas and Texas Tech game took place after the polo shirts were sold, we can assume that all 95 polo shirts were sold during this time. Therefore, the amount of money earned per polo shirt is:

$8,425 / 95 = $87

So, if they sold 47 polo shirts during the Arkansas game, they earned:

$87 x 47 = $4,099"
"Response: 77
Explanation: According to the passage, a total of 242 polo shirts were sold during both games combined. If 115 polos were sold at the Arkansas game, then the number of polos sold at the Texas Tech game is equal to 242 - 115 = 127."
"Response:  $89
Explanation:  The total number of polo shirts sold is given as 163. If 89 polo shirts were sold during the Arkansas game, then the revenue from the sale of those polo shirts is $89."
"Response:  $134
Explanation:
The total number of polo shirts sold is given as 186. Since 78 dollars are charged for each polo shirt, the total revenue from sales is 186 x 78 = 14040 dollars.
Since half of the sales occurred during the Arkansas game (172 polos sold), the revenue from those sales alone is 172 x 78 = 13056 dollars.
Therefore, the remaining revenue from the Texas Tech game is 14040 - 13056 = 984 dollars."
"Response:  $62 x 183 = $11,546

Question:  A Razorback üzlet 62 dollárt keres minden pólóból és 99 dollárt minden ingből. Az Arkansas és Texas Tech meccsen 183 pólót és 31 díszt adtak el. Mennyit kerestek a póló eladásból?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  $99 x 31 = $3099"
"Response:  $2380
Explanation:
The number of polos sold is given as 74, and each polo costs $67. Therefore, the total revenue from polo sales is $74 x $67 = $4968. Since the razorbacks also sell merchandise, they earned an additional $165 per item sold. The total amount of money the razorbacks earned from both polo and merchandise sales is therefore $4968 + ($165 x 156) = $6363."
Response:  $192/157 = $1.20 per póló.
Response:  $10/polo = $10/($254 polos + $43 disks) = $0.40 per polo.
"Response:  $269
Explanation:  To find out how much money was made from selling the polos at the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the cost of the polos ($8 x 130 = $1,040) from the total amount of money earned from selling them ($51 x 130 = $6,530). Therefore, the profit from selling the polos is $6,530 - $1,040 = $5,490."

"Response:  $394
Explanation:
Lewis will have $394 left after paying his taxes of $702 for a period of 216 weeks. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of taxes ($702) from the total income ($216 \times 216 = $45,840)."

"Response:  $276544.50
Explanation:
Lewis wants to earn $28 per hour for 1091 hours of work, which is equivalent to $28 x 1091 = $286,688. However, he also wants to be compensated for overtime at a rate of $939 per hour. If he works every week and takes every other week off, he will have worked a total of 50 weeks in one year. Therefore, his total earnings from working and taking time off can be calculated as follows:
Total earnings from working = $286,688 (from direct labor) + ($939/hour x 50 weeks) = $276,544.50
Therefore, Lewis's total earnings from working and taking time off are $276,544.50."

"Response: 5 meters
Explanation: According to the passage, Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron. If Ron is 14 feet (which is equal to 4.3 meters) deep in the water, then Dean would be 2 meters lower than that, or 4.3 + 2 = 6.3 meters deep. Since the passage states that the water is twice as deep as Dean's height, we can conclude that the depth of the water is 6.3 x 2 = 12.6 meters."
"Response: 5 x (Ron's height) + 3 = depth of water
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Ron is 5 times as tall as he is deep in the water. We also know that Dean is 3 meters below Ron. Therefore, if Ron is at a depth of $x$ meters, then Dean is at a depth of $x - 3$ meters. So, the depth of the water can be calculated as follows: $$depth = 5 \times height + 3$$ where $height$ is the height of Ron. Substituting this value into the equation, we get: $$depth = 5 \times 5 = 25 + 3 = 28$$ meters."
"Response: 27 meters
Explanation:
Dean's height is 1 meter more than Ron's height, so Dean's depth in the water would be 1 meter + 15 times the difference between their heights = 16 meters (since the water is 15 times deeper than Dean). Since Ron is 13 feet deep, that means he is 4 meters (13 x 0.3048) below the surface of the water. Therefore, the depth of the water is 27 meters (16 + 4)."
"Response: 24 meters
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Ron is 13 feet (4.27 meters) deep in the water. We also know that Dean is 3 meters taller than Ron, which means he is 16 meters tall (4.92 feet). Finally, we are told that the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height, so if Ron is 13 feet deep, then the water must be 208 feet (63.5 meters) deep."
"Response: 230 feet
Explanation:
Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, so their combined height is 15 + (6 - 6) = 15 + 0 = 15 feet. Since the water is 9 times deeper than Dean's height, it would be 9 x 15 = 135 feet deep. However, since the question states that the water is ""kilencszer"" greater in depth than Dean's height, we can multiply this by 10 to get a total depth of 10 x 135 = 1350 feet."

"Response: 356
Explanation:
The number of students in each class = 98 / 21 = 4.6
Since there are 7 school buses and each bus can carry 46 students (based on the given information), then the total number of seats available on all buses = 7 x 46 = 302.
Therefore, the number of seats per bus = Total number of seats available on all buses / Number of buses = 302 / 7 = 43.
So, there are 43 seats available on each bus."
"Response:  There are 84 classes in the school and 95 school buses with 118 seating capacity per bus. Therefore, there are 
    (84 x 95) / 118 = 760 students in the school."
"Response: 3
Explanation: The school has 67 classes and 66 students in each class, for a total of 4280 students. Since there are 6 seats per bus, we need 713 buses to transport all the students (4280 / 6 = 713)."
"Response: 3
Explanation: The number of students in each class is given as 58, and there are 87 classes in total. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 58 x 87 = 4960. Since two buses are needed for the trip, we need one bus for every 2480 students (4960 / 2)."
Response:  There are 36 students in each class (24 classes x 120 students / 24 classes). Therefore, there are 36 students in each of the 8 buses (8 buses x 36 students/bus).
"Response: 3
Explanation: If there are 102 students in total and 22 do not want to go on the field trip, then the number of students who will be on each bus can be calculated as follows: Total number of students / Number of buses = Number of students per bus. In this case, the calculation would be: 102 students - 22 students = 80 students / 8 buses = 10 students per bus. Therefore, 3 buses are needed to transport all the students on the field trip."
"Response: 74
Explanation: Let's assume that 102 - 11 = 91 students are going on the field trip. Since 8 students do not want to go, we subtract them from the total number of students who will be on the buses: 91 - 8 = 83 students per bus. Therefore, there will be 83 students in each of the 9 buses."
"Response: 4
Explanation: If there are 72 classes in the school and each class has 3 students, then the total number of students in the school is 72 x 3 = 216. Since they need 111 students to fill all the buses, we can divide 216 by 111 to find out how many buses they will need: 216 / 111 = 4. Therefore, they will need 4 buses for the field trip."
"Response: 52
Explanation:
There are 46 school buses and 92 students in the school. If each bus is full (i.e., every seat is occupied), then there are 52 seats per bus ($ \times $ 46 buses)."

Response: 150 pages per day.
"Response: 170 pages
Explanation:
Frank took 220 days to finish reading his favorite book, which has 555 pages in total. Since there are 5 chapters in the book, each chapter must have approximately 111 pages (555 / 5 = 111)."
"Response: 4.28
Explanation: To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages (193) by the time it took him to finish the book (660 days). This gives us an average of 4.28 pages per day."
"Response: 81
Explanation:
Frank took 3 days to finish reading all the books (3 x 249 = 747 pages). Since each book had 249 pages, Frank read 747 / 3 = 249 pages per day. Therefore, he read 249 pages per day."
"Response: 50
Explanation:
Frank took 12 days to finish each book (since there are 66 pages in each book), so he finished all books in 492 days ( since there are 492 - 12 = 480 days left after finishing all books). Therefore, Frank read 50 books (since there are 50 x 12 = 600 days in total)."
Response: 9.375 (approximately)
"Response: 10 days
Explanation: According to the question, Frank read 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total. Therefore, it will take him 10 days (576 / 8 = 72) to finish reading the entire book."
"Response: 925
Explanation:
Frank took 30 days to finish reading his favorite book, which has 41 chapters with each chapter containing 450 pages. Therefore, he read 450 pages per day. To find out how many pages Frank read in one day, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of days taken to finish the book: 450 pages/day x 30 days = 13,500 pages. So, Frank read 13,500 pages in 30 days or approximately 925 pages per day."
"Response: 328 pages
Explanation:  The book had three chapters with each chapter having 192 pages (594 / 3 = 192). Therefore, there are 328 pages in each chapter."
"Response: 1.375
Explanation:
Frank took 664 days to read his favorite book, which consists of two chapters with 405 pages each. To calculate how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages by the time taken to finish reading the book:
Pages read per day = Total pages / Time taken to finish reading the book
= 810 pages (2 x 405 pages) / 664 days
= 1.375 pages per day
Therefore, Frank read approximately 1.375 pages of his favorite book every day."

"Response: 14
Explanation: If there are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection, and we divide the bananas into 7 groups of 28 each (since 203 / 7 = 28), then the remaining 35 bananas will be grouped with the oranges. Therefore, the number of groups for both is 95 + 35 = 130."
"Response: 178
Explanation: According to the question, there are 356 narancs in Philip's collection. If we divide them into groups of 47 bananas each, then there will be 356 / 47 = 7 narancs in each group. Therefore, the number of groups of narancs is 7 x 178 = 1260. So, the number of narancs in each group is 1260 - 356 = 904."
Response:  The group contains 196 bananas.
Response:  There are 9 groups of bananas in Philip's collection if there are 180 bananas total and they are divided into 18 different sizes.
"Response: 10
Explanation: If there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection, then if we divide the bananas into 2 groups, each group will have 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Similarly, if we divide the oranges into 93 groups, each group will have 9 oranges (87 / 93 = 0.10). Therefore, the size of each group is 10."
"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the question, there are 384 narancs in Philip's collection and 192 bananas. If we divide the bananas into 345 groups, then the number of narancs in each group is 16 (since there are 384 narancs total and 345 groups of bananas). Therefore, the narancs are grouped together in 16 different sets."

Response: 50 üveg (30 + 8 = 50)
"Response: 16
Explanation: If there were 79 glasses of regular soda and 53 glasses of diet soda, then the difference between the two is 26 (79 - 53). Since there were 42 apples, we can subtract that number from the total difference to find out how many more glasses of regular soda were consumed than diet soda: 26 - 42 = 16. Therefore, 16 more glasses of regular soda were consumed than diet soda."

"Response: 82
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 317 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel visited it. If there were 295 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 22 (317 - 295 = 22). Therefore, 22 people visited the Buckingham Palace on the day before Rachel visited it."
"Response: 198
Explanation:
If there were 703 visitors to the Buckingham Palace in one day and Rachel found out that 246 of them visited the palace the previous day, then the total number of visitors to the palace over a period of 25 days would be:
Total visitors = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 703 x 25
= 19825
So, there were approximately 198 visitors to the Buckingham Palace every day for a period of 25 days."
"Response: 334
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 100 visitors to the Buckingham Palace the day before, and 666 visitors the same day as Rachel's visit. Therefore, if 666 visitors visited the palace on that day, then 334 visitors visited the previous day (since 100 + 666 = 766)."
"Response: 584
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* The number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel visited it was 132.
* If 406 people visited the Buckingham Palace over the last 327 days, then the number of visitors on the previous day would be 584 (since there are 327 days before the current day).
Therefore, the answer is 584."
"Response: 10376
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* After eating dinner, we went to see the Buckingham Palace.
* Rachel found out that 45 people had visited the Buckingham Palace the day before.
* If 829 people have visited the Buckingham Palace over the past 85 days, then the number of visitors on a particular day can be calculated as follows:

Number of visitors on a particular day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 829 / 85
= 10376
Therefore, the answer is 10376."
"Response: 349
Explanation:
If there were 557 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the day in question and 188 visitors the previous day, then the total number of visitors over a period of 57 days would be:
Total visitors = Number of visitors on Day 1 + Number of visitors on Day 2 +... + Number of visitors on Day 57
= 188 + (557 - 188) / 57
= 349
Therefore, there were 349 visitors to the Buckingham Palace over the 57-day period."
"Response: 425
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 661 visitors to the Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel visited it. If there were 600 visitors the previous day, then the difference between the two days is 61 (661 - 600 = 61). Therefore, the number of visitors who went to the Buckingham Palace before Rachel's visit is 61 + 600 = 661."
"Response: 586
Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to the Buckingham Palace on each day is x. We know that 419 people visited the palace yesterday and 103 people visited it the day before yesterday. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x + 419 = 586
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 775
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 387
So, there were 387 people who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day."
"Response: 635
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* On the day after we visited the Buckingham Palace, Rachel found out that 512 visitors had come to the palace on that day.
* The previous day, there were 471 visitors to the palace.
* In the last 89 days, the total number of visitors to the palace was 808.
To find out how many visitors came to the palace each day during this period, we can use the following formula:
Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Number of visitors per day = 808 / 89 = 9
So, there were 9 visitors to the Buckingham Palace each day over the last 89 days."
"Response: 368
Explanation:
The information given in the question is as follows:
* On the day after we visited the Buckingham Palace, there were 705 visitors.
* The previous day, there were 191 visitors.
* The day before that, there were 457 visitors.
To find out how many visitors went to the Buckingham Palace over the past 245 days, we can use the following formula:
Number of visitors = (Current number of visitors - Previous day's number) + (Previous day's number - Day before that's number) +... + (Day before that's number - First day's number)
In this case, the first day's number is 191, so let's plug it into the formula:
Number of visitors = (705 - 191) + (191 - 457) +... + (457 - 191)
= 368
Therefore, over the past 245 days, 368 people visited the Buckingham Palace."
"Response: 370 grams of wax are already available. To find out how much more wax is needed, we can subtract the amount of wax that is already available (370 grams) from the total amount of wax required (628 grams):

628 - 370 = 258 grams

Therefore, there are 258 grams of wax still needed."
"Response: 18 grams
Explanation:
The total amount of paint needed is 49 grams, and there are 288 grams of wax required for each feather. Therefore, if only 260 grams of wax are available, then the number of feathers that can be painted is:

Number of feathers = Total amount of paint / Amount of wax per feather
= 49 g / 288 g
= 0.173 feathers
So, there are approximately 0.173 feathers that can be painted with the available amount of wax."
"Response: 108 grams
Explanation:
The total amount of wax needed for all the feathers is 57 + 22 = 79 grams. Since there are 353 grammas of feathers in total, we can calculate the amount of wax per feather by dividing the total amount of wax by the number of feathers: 79 / 353 = 0.226 grams per feather. Therefore, there are already 108 grams of wax used (0.226 x 473)."
Response: 34 grams
Response: 30 grams of wax are needed to connect the feathers. If there are currently 17 grams of wax available and 557 grams were originally required, then 30 grams is the amount needed for connecting the feathers.
"Response: 503 grams
Explanation:
The total amount of wax needed for all feathers is 492 grams. Since there are currently 11 grams of wax available, we need an additional 503 grams (492 - 11 = 503) of wax to meet the demand."

Explanation: The total number of aquariums = 26. Since each aquarium has an equal number of fish (52), we can divide the total number of fish by the number of aquariums to find out how many fish are in each aquarium: 52 / 26 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 fish in each aquarium."
Response: 20 aquariums (or half of 40 animals).
"Response: 56 / 2 = 28
There are 28 freshwater animals in Tyler's aquarium."
"Response: 22
Explanation: According to the passage, there are 74 edible fish and 22 saltwater aquariums. If every aquarium has 46 animals, then the number of saltwater fish at Tyler's place is also 46 x 22 = 980. Therefore, there must be 980 - 22 = 958 edible fish at Tyler's place, which means that there are 22 saltwater fish at his location."

"Response: 10 houses
Explanation: According to the question, if a postal worker needs to deliver 5 letters to each house in a neighborhood, and there are 25 letters total, then there must be 25/5 = 5 houses per tumble. Therefore, there are 10 tumbles (5 x 2) of houses in the neighborhood."
"Response: 5
Explanation: If there are 20 houses in each tőmb and the postal worker needs to deliver 9 letters to every house, then the total number of letters that can be delivered is:

20 x 9 = 180 letters
So, the postal worker can deliver 5 letters per household (since there are 5 households in each tőmb)."
"Response: 1/3 (or 0.33)
Explanation: The total number of houses in the building is 6. If each house needs 24 pieces of mail, then the total number of pieces of mail needed for all houses is 6 x 24 = 144. Since there are 6 houses in the building, we can divide the total number of pieces of mail by 6 to get the average number of pieces of mail per house, which is 144 / 6 = 1/3 or 0.33."
Response: 50 houses are in one neighborhood.
Response: 48 (postal packages).
"Response: 5
Explanation: Since there are 78 houses in total and each house has 19 mailboxes, the number of emails that the postal worker needs to deliver is 78 x 19 = 1462. Therefore, the postal worker can deliver 5 emails to each house, which means they will need to deliver 5 x 1462 = 7310 emails in total."
Response: 16 houses are in each tome.
"Response: 3
Explanation: Since there are 81 houses in total and each house has 12 houses in it, the number of emails that can be delivered to each house is 81/12 = 6. Therefore, the total number of emails that can be delivered is 6 x 4 = 24."
"Response: 50
Explanation:
The number of houses in each towner is given by 16houses/towner. Since there are 17 houses per towner, we can write:
$$ \frac{16}{1} = 17 $$
So, each towner has $17$ houses. Therefore, the number of packets that the mailman needs to deliver is:
$$ \boxed{\text {50}} $$
Since each packet contains $4$ letters, the total number of letters that need to be delivered is:
$$ \boxed{\text {200}} $$"

"Response: 20
Explanation: If Emily made 4 necklaces with 5 beads each, then she made a total of 4 x 5 = 20 beads."
"Response: 48
Explanation: If Emily has 72 friends and each friend receives one necklace with 3 gems per necklace, then Emily can make a total of 72 x 3 = 216 necklaces. Since there are only 6 gems available, Emily cannot make more than 216 / 6 = 36 necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 48."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
To make each necklace, Emily needed 5 gypsies. Since she made 20 necklaces in total, she needed 5 x 20 = 100 gypsies in total. However, there were only 43 friends, so she did not have enough gypsies to make all of the necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 16."
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, Emily made 26 necklaces and each necklace contains 2 gypsies. Therefore, the total number of gypsies Emily had is 26 x 2 = 52. Since there are 44 friends, the remaining 9 gypsies (52 - 44) must be Emily's share. So, the answer is 9."
"Response: 340777

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of children who went to camp is x. Since there are 819058 - 668278 = 150776 more children at home than in camp, we can write an equation:
x + (150776) = 819058
Now, we need to find out how many children stayed at home. We know that the total number of children is equal to the sum of those who went to camp and those who stayed at home:
Children = Number of children who went to camp + Number of children who stayed at home
Children = x + (668278 - 150776)
Children = x + (-85851)
Children = x + 85851
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
x = 340777
Therefore, 340777 children stayed at home during the summer break."

"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, four right angles are required to secure each large panel to the house walls. Since there are eight panels in total (as mentioned in the problem statement), and each panel requires two right angles to be secured, the number of right angles needed for John to attach all the panels to the house walls is 8 x 2 = 16. Therefore, the answer is 4."
"Response: 20
Explanation: To determine how many right triangles are needed to build the house walls, we need to calculate the number of right triangles that can be formed using the given measurements.

From the problem statement, we know that there are 13 large boards and each board requires 17 right angles for attachment. Therefore, the total number of right triangles required is:

13 x 17 = 207

However, since some of these triangles will overlap or be used multiple times, we cannot use all of them in building the house walls. So, let's round up the number of usable right triangles to the nearest whole number, which is 20.

Therefore, John needs 20 right triangles to build the house walls."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the problem statement, 11 angles are needed for the house walls, and each angle requires 3 pieces of wood (desk). Therefore, the total number of desks required is 11 / 3 = 5."
Response: 36
"Response: 8
Explanation: According to the problem statement, John needs 2 right angles (or 90-degree angles) to attach 16 pieces of wood to the walls of his house. Since each piece of wood requires two right angles, John will need a total of 8 right angles (or 8 x 90 degrees = 720 degrees)."
"Response: 560
Explanation:
The total number of desks required for the house walls is given by the product of the number of walls (8) and the number of desks used per wall (74). Therefore, the total number of desks needed is 8 x 74 = 560."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, they used 12 large and 17 small pieces of wood for the house walls. If each large piece is required to make 14 right angles, then there are 12/14 = 8/7 = 1 1/3 large pieces needed for one complete angle. Since there are 360 degrees in a full circle (i.e., 360 x 1/360 = 1), we can calculate the number of small pieces needed as follows: 17 / 25 = 6 1/3. Therefore, John needs 1 + 6 = 7 desks for his house wall."
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, there are 42 rágók in total and each package contains 3 rágók. Therefore, the number of packages that Robin has is 42 / 3 = 14. Since there are 14 packages, Robin has 14 packages."
Response: 150 gumballs
"Response: 5
Explanation:
Let's assume that there are x number of packages in total. Since each package has 7 rugs, and Robin has 6 extra rugs, the total number of rugs is 7x + 6 = 42. As we know that Robin has 6 pieces of every package, so he must have 6/7th of the total number of packages which is equal to 6/7 \* x = 5 packages. Therefore, the answer is 5 packages."

Response:  The industrial machine can produce 3 poles per minute. Therefore, it took 6 minutes to make all six poles (3 x 6 = 18). So, the gear worked for 6 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine can produce 4 poles in one minute, so it produced 4 x 5 = 20 poles during its 5-minute operation.
Response: 21 minutes. Explanation: If the machine produced 9 poles yesterday and 44 poles today, then it produced 37 poles in total (9 + 44). Since it can produce 3 poles per minute, it worked for 37 / 3 = 12 minutes yesterday and 44 / 3 = 14 minutes today. Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 21 minutes (12 + 14)
Response: 4 minutes. Explanation: If the machine produced 13 poles yesterday and 3 poles today, then it is producing 8 poles every minute. Therefore, if it took 4 minutes to produce 8 poles, it means that the machine worked for 32 minutes (4 x 8 = 32).
Response: 3 minutes
Response: 2 minutes. Explanation: If the industrial machine can produce 3 poles per minute today and produced 4 poles yesterday, then it means that the production rate has increased by 1 pole per minute (from 3 to 4). Therefore, if it took 2 minutes to produce 4 poles yesterday, it will take 1 minute to produce 8 poles today. So, the time taken to produce 8 poles is 1 minute.
Response:  The industrial machine can produce 14 poles in one hour. Therefore, if it worked for 12 hours yesterday and produced 14 poles today, then it has produced a total of 14 x 12 = 168 poles altogether.
