Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 18 children and an ogre. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children and an ogre. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday: 18 - 10 = 8 Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday.
"Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 11 children and an ogre in a game of ""Ogre Tag"". On Tuesday, she played with 12 children and the same ogre again. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Tuesday than on Monday, we can subtract the number of children she played with on Monday from the number of children she played with on Tuesday: 12 - 11 = 1 So, Julia played with one more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday."
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 5 children. Then, she played with additional 3 children on Tuesday, making it a total of 8 children. So, the answer is 8.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 3 children (child 1, child 2, and child 3). On Tuesday, she played with 14 children (children 4 to 17). So, in total, Julia played with 17 children (3 + 14 = 17). Therefore, on Monday, Julia played with 3 children.
Response:  If Julia played with 16 children and an ogre on Monday (day of the week not specified), and there were 12 more children than ogres, then the number of children she played with on Monday is: 16 - 12 = 4  So, on Monday, Julia played with 4 children and an ogre.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 14 children and an ogre in hide-and-seek. On Tuesday, she played with more than 8 but fewer than 14 children and an ogre again. So, there were between 8 and 14 children playing hide-and-seek with Julia on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of children who played with Julia on Monday was 14 - 8 = 6.
Response:  Monday - 17 children + Tuesday - 15 children = Total number of children played with on both days = 32 children Wednesday - 2 children = Total number of children played with on this day = 2 children Therefore, Julia played with a total of 34 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 15 children. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 97 children. So, in total, Julia played with: 15 + 18 + 97 = 130 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 5 children. On Tuesday, she played with 9 children. On Wednesday, she played with 15 children. Therefore, the total number of children that Julia played with is: 5 + 9 + 15 = 30
Response:  Monday - 2 children + 14 children = 16 children Tuesday - 16 children Wednesday - 16 children Thursday - 0 children (Julia did not play with any children) Therefore, Julia played with 16 children on Monday and Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 9 children and an ogre. On Tuesday, she played with 7 children and an ogre. On Wednesday, she played with 96 children and no ogres. So, on Monday, Julia had more children to play with than on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is A) More children.
Response:  Monday - 14 children + Tuesday - 2 children = Total number of children played with on Monday is 14 + Number of children played with on Tuesday is 2 = Total number of children played with in two days = 16. So, there are 16 children in total.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 8 children. On Tuesday, she played with 11 children, which is more than 8. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Tuesday and Monday is 3 (11 - 8). Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Monday and Tuesday are both days when Julia played with children. So, let's say there were x number of children playing with Julia on Monday and y number of children playing with her on Tuesday. Since we know that Julia played with more than 7 children on Wednesday, we can assume that x > 7. Also, since we know that Julia played with fewer children on Tuesday than on Monday, we can write y < x. Now, we need to find the value of x and y that satisfies these two inequalities. We can do this by using algebraic manipulation or by graphing the inequality on a number line. After some calculations, we get x = 9 and y = 6. Therefore, Julia played with 9 more children on Monday than she did on Tuesday.
Response:  Monday - 13 kids + Julia = 14 people Tuesday - 10 kids + Julia = 11 people Wednesday - 15 kids + Julia = 26 people Total number of children Julia played with = 14 + 11 + 26 = 51 people
Response:  Monday - 7 children + Julia = X Tuesday - 13 children + Julia = Y Wednesday - 20 children + Julia = Z Total number of children and Julia = X + Y + Z So, the total number of children and Julia is equal to 7 + 13 + 20 = 40. Therefore, Julia played with 40 children in total.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 12 children and an ogre for 6 hours (as stated in the problem). Then, on Tuesday, she played with 14 children and an ogre for 7 hours (also as stated in the problem). So, in total, Julia spent 6 + 7 = 13 hours playing with children and ogres. Therefore, the answer is 13.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 19 children and an ogre for 5 hours (from 9 AM to 2 PM). Then she took a break of 4 hours (from 2 PM to 6 PM) before playing again with another 18 children and an ogre for 3 hours (from 6 PM to 9 PM). Therefore, in total, Julia spent 38 hours playing with children and ogres. Now, let's compare how many children Julia had on each day:  On Monday, Julia had 19 children + 1 ogre = 20 people.  On Tuesday, Julia had 18 children + 1 ogre = 19 people. As we can see, Julia had one more child on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children Julia had on these two days is 1 (19 - 18 = 1).
Response:  Monday has 6 children and Tuesday has 5 children. So, in total, we have 6 + 5 = 11 children playing together. Therefore, there are 11 - 6 = 5 more children playing with Julia on Tuesday than on Monday.
"Response:  We know that Julia played with 4 children on Monday and then some more children on Tuesday. So, let's assume that she played with x + 4 children on Tuesday. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write an equation: 
x + 4 = 18 
Now, solve for x using basic arithmetic operations: 
x = 14 
So, Julia played with 14 children on Tuesday."
Response:  Monday - 6 children + Tuesday - 17 children = Total number of children played with on these two days = 23 children Wednesday - 4 children = Total number of children played with on Wednesday = 23 + 4 = 27 children So, there are 27 more children played with on Wednesday than on Monday.
Response:  Bobby initially ate x candies. Then he ate an additional 25 candies, so his total was x + 25 = 43 candies. Since he started with x candies, we can write the equation: x + 25 = 43. To solve for x, subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: x = 18. So, Bobby initially ate 18 candies.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 candies and then he ate another 42 candies after that. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 = 70 candies. Then, he ate 63 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of sweets Bobby ate is 70 + 63 = 133 sweets.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 candies and then he ate additional 4 more candies. So far, Bobby has eaten a total of 37 candies (33 + 4). Then, he ate 14 chocolates. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby has eaten is 51 (37 + 14).
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 candies and then ate another 36 candies after that. So, in total, he ate 74 candies. Now, let's compare this to the chocolates he ate - he ate 16 chocolates. Therefore, Bobby ate 74 - 16 = 58 more candies than chocolates.  So, Bobby ate 58 more candies than chocolates.
Response:  Bobby had 20 candies initially and he ate 34 of them, so he has eaten a total of 34 + 34 = 68 candies. Then, he ate another 18 candies, so the final number of candies he ate is 68 + 18 = 86 candies. Therefore, Bobby ate a total of 86 candies in all.
Response:  Bobby had 21 candies initially and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 21 - 5 = 16 candies left. Then, he ate another 9 candies, so he has 16 - 9 = 7 candies left now. Therefore, Bobby has 7 candies left.
Response:  Bobby had 22 candies initially and he ate some of them. Then, he ate additional 5 candies. So, the total number of candies Bobby ate is 5 + 22 = 27. Now, if Bobby still has 8 candies left, it means that he ate 27 - 8 = 19 candies in total. Therefore, Bobby initially had 22 candies.
Response:  Bobby had 19 candies initially and he ate 2 of them. So, now he has 19 - 2 = 17 candies left. Therefore, Bobby still has 17 candies.
Response:  Bobby had 32 candies initially and he ate some of them. We know that after eating some candies, the number of candies left with him was 20. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 32 - x = 20 where x is the number of candies Bobby ate. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use the principle of balance, which states that the total number of candies must be equal to the sum of the number of candies initially and the number of candies eaten. In other words: 32 + x = 52 (since there are 52 candies in total) Solving for x, we get: x = 20 Substituting this value back into our original equation, we get: 32 - 20 = 20 Which simplifies to: 12 = 20 This means that Bobby ate 8 candies (20 - 12). Therefore, Bobby ate 8 candies.
Response:  Bobby initially had 36 candies and then he ate 17 of them. So, he has 36 - 17 = 19 candies left. Then, he ate another 15 candies, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 candies left. Therefore, Bobby has 4 candies left.
Response:  Bob had initially 30 candies and he ate 23 of them. So, now he has 7 candies left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  Alan has 5 wind balloons and Jake has 3 wind balloons. So, in total, Alan has 5 + 3 = 8 wind balloons. Therefore, Alan has more wind balloons than Jake.
"Response: 
Alain has 2 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons. So, in total, Alain has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. Therefore, Jake has more balloons than Alain."
Response:  If Alan brought 2 wind balloons to the park and Jake had already brought 1 wind balloon there, then together they have 3 wind balloons at the park (2 + 1 = 3). So, Jake has 1 wind balloon at the park.
Response:  If Jake has 6 wind balloons and he gives 4 more than Alan, then Jake gave 10 (6 + 4) wind balloons to the park. So, Alan has 10 - 4 = 6 wind balloons in the park.
Response:  Alan has 5 balloons and Jake has more than 5 but less than 11 (since he has 6 more than Alan). So, Jake must have 6 balloons in total.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 3 balloons and Jake has 5 balloons, so together they have 8 balloons (3 + 5). Then, afterward, Alan buys 2 more balloons, making it a total of 10 balloons in the park (8 + 2). Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 2 wind balloons and then he bought additional 3 more at the park. So, initially, Alan had 2 + 3 = 5 wind balloons. Now, Jake had 4 wind balloons. Therefore, the difference between the number of wind balloons possessed by Alan and Jake is:  5 - 4 = 1. Hence, Alan had 1 more wind balloon than Jake in the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 2 balloons and then he buys 3 more in the park, so he has 5 balloons in total. Now, Jake has 6 balloons and then he gives 3 to Alan, so Jake has 9 balloons left. Therefore, Jake has 9 - 5 = 4 more balloons than Alan. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, Alan has 5 balloons and takes them to the park. Then, Jake brings 4 more balloons to the park. So far, they have 9 balloons in total (5 + 4 = 9). Later, Alan buys 3 more balloons, taking the total number of balloons he has at the park to 12 (9 + 3 = 12). Therefore, Alan has 12 balloons at the park.
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 6 balloons and Jake had 2 balloons. So, together they had 8 balloons (6 + 2). Then, Jake bought additional 3 balloons in the park, so now he has 5 balloons (2 + 3). Now, let's check how many balloons Alan has after Jake buying more balloons. If we subtract the number of balloons that Jake bought from his initial balance, then Alan still has 3 balloons left with him (6 - 3 = 3). Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons. So together they had 9 balloons (6 + 3). Then Jake bought additional 4 balloons in the park, so now he has 13 balloons (3 + 4). Therefore, Jake has more balloons than Alan in the park. The difference between their number of balloons is 4 (13 - 9).
Response:  Firstly, Alan had 5 balloons and Jake had 6 balloons. Then, Jake bought additional 3 balloons in the park, so he had 9 balloons in total (6 + 3). Therefore, Jake had 9 balloons in the park.
"Response: 
1. Alan has 3 wind balloons and 20 balls. So he has a total of 3 + 20 = 23 objects. 
2. Jake has 5 wind balloons and 59 balls. So he has a total of 5 + 59 = 64 objects. 
Now let's add up the number of wind balloons and balls that both Alan and Jake have: 
Alan has 3 wind balloons and 20 balls, so his total is 3 + 20 = 23. 
Jake has 5 wind balloons and 59 balls, so his total is 5 + 59 = 64. 
So together, they have 23 + 64 = 87 objects. Therefore, Park has 87 wind balloons and balls."
Response:  Alan has 7 balloons and Jack has 6 balloons, so together they have 7 + 6 = 13 balloons. Now, let's count the number of balls that both of them have. Alan has 7 balls and Jack has 5 balls, so together they have 7 + 5 = 12 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that Alan and Jack have is 13 (balloons) + 12 (balls) = 25.
Response:  If Alan has 5 balloons and he joins forces with Jake to bring 6 balloons to the park, then we can conclude that Jake must have had 1 additional balloon before joining forces with Alan. Therefore, Jake has 6 balloons in total. So, the answer is 6.
Response:  Alan has 2 wind balloons in the park and then buys 3 more. So, he now has 5 wind balloons in total (2 + 3 = 5). If Jake also brings 6 wind balloons to the park, then Jake will have more than Alan because Jake has 6 wind balloons while Alan only has 5. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time studied in English. So, if Ryan studies English for 6 hours, and Chinese for 2 hours, then he spends 6 - 2 = 4 hours more studying English than Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 4 hours more studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent studying English from the time spent studying Chinese. So, if Ryan studies Chinese for 7 hours and English for 6 hours, then he spends 1 hour (7 - 6 = 1) more studying Chinese than English. Therefore, the answer is 1 hour.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English every day and additionally spends time studying Chinese. He spends a total of 4 hours studying Chinese each day. So, he spends x hours studying Chinese per day. Since he studies Chinese for 7 days in a week, he spends x \* 7 = 21 hours studying Chinese per week.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and more than 7 hours studying Chinese. So, he spends at least 14 hours (7 + x) studying languages every day. Now, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends studying Chinese. We know that the time he spends studying Chinese is greater than 2 times the time he spends studying English, so we can write an equation: 14 = 2x + y, where y is the number of hours Ryan spends studying English. Solving for y, we get y = 6. Therefore, Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day.
Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and also studies English for more than 5 hours. So he spends 2 hours more studying English than Chinese. Therefore, he spends 7 hours (5 + 2) studying English per day.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese every day. If he studies for 5 days, then the total number of hours he spends studying English is: 6 x 5 = 30 hours The total number of hours he spends studying Chinese is: 7 x 5 = 35 hours So, in total, Ryan spends 30 + 35 = 65 hours studying both languages over 5 days.
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese. If he studies for 2 days, he will spend a total of 12 hours studying English (6 x 2 = 12) and 10 hours studying Chinese (5 x 2 = 10). So, in total, Ryan will spend 22 hours studying both languages (12 + 10 = 22).
"Response:  Ryan spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Chinese. If he studies for 6 days, he will spend a total of:

English = 5 x 6 = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 x 6 = 24 hours
Total = 30 + 24 = 54 hours
Therefore, Ryan spent a total of 54 hours studying Chinese during those 6 days."
"Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English every day and 6 hours studying Chinese every day. If he studies for 86 days, then... See details
Answer:  Let's think step by step.

Ryan spends 4 hours studying English every day and 6 hours studying Chinese every day. If he studies for 86 days, then:

English study time = Total study time / Number of days
= 4 hours/day x 86 days
= 352 hours (or 15 days)

Chinese study time = Total study time / Number of days
= 6 hours/day x 86 days
= 502 hours (or 21 days)

Therefore, Ryan spent 352 hours studying English and 502 hours studying Chinese over the course of 86 days."
"Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day, and he spends 7 hours studying Chinese. So far, we have:

English - 6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week
Chinese - 7 hours/day x 7 days/week = 49 hours/week

Now let's add up the time spent studying Spanish:
Spanish - 3 hours/day x 7 days/week = 21 hours/week

So, in total, Ryan spends:
Total - 42 + 49 + 21 = 102 hours/week on language learning."
Response:  Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 3 hours studying Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying English. So, if Ryan spends 6 hours studying English, that means he has 6 - 3 = 3 additional hours to spend studying English compared to Chinese. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 more hours studying English than Chinese.
Response:  Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish every day. To find out how many more hours he spends studying English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the total time spent studying English. So, if Ryan spends 7 hours studying English, he spends 5 hours (7 - 2) studying other languages, including Spanish. Therefore, he spends 3 hours more studying English than Spanish (5 - 4).
Response:  Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese. He also spends 4 hours studying Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends studying Chinese than Spanish, we need to subtract the time spent studying Spanish from the time spent studying Chinese. So, the answer is: 5 - 4 = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour more studying Chinese than Spanish.
Response:  Ryan spends 3 hours studying English and Chinese every day. He spends 2 hours studying English and x hours studying Chinese. So, x = 1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour studying Chinese every day.
Response:  Ryan spends 4 hours studying English every day and 5 hours studying Chinese every day. Therefore, he spends a total of 4 x 7 = 28 hours studying English in one week. He also spends 5 x 7 = 35 hours studying Chinese in one week. So, in total, Ryan spends 28 + 35 = 63 hours studying both languages in one week.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 8 cans. The next day, she found additional 7 cans, so the total number of cans she had on Tuesday was 8 + 7 = 15 cans. Therefore, there were 5 more cans on Tuesday than on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 7 cans. The next day, she found an additional 12 cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 7 + 12 = 19 cans.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 4 cans. If she found more cans on Tuesday, then the total number of cans she had after collecting them both days is: 4 + (number of cans found on Tuesday) =?  So, the answer is 5.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected some cans and had 3 bags of them. The next day, she found additional 4 bags of cans, making it total of 8 bags. So, on Monday, Tiffany had how many bags of cans?  Answer: 3
Response:  On Monday, there were 10 cans collected. Then, on Tuesday, 3 cans were found, and on Wednesday, 7 more cans were found. Therefore, in total, Tiphany had 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 cans.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany found 8 cans. The next day, she found 10 more cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 cans. Then, on the third day, she found 4 more cans, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 cans in total. Therefore, Tiffany found a total of 22 cans after Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 3 cans. The next day, she found additional 7 cans and also found 44 bottles. So, in total, Tiffany had how many containers? Total number of containers = Number of cans + Number of bottles = 3 + 44 = 47 containers. Therefore, Tiffany had 47 containers in total.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red cherries and 16 green cherries in the basket. So, if we subtract the number of green cherries from the total number of cherries, we get: 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there is one more red cherry than green cherry in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red cherries and 11 green cherries in the basket. So, if we combine both types of cherries, we have a total of: 5 + 11 = 16 cherries. Therefore, there are 16 - 5 = 11 green cherries more than red cherries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red cherries and 5 more green cherries than red ones in the basket. So, the total number of cherries in the basket is 10 + 5 = 15. Now, we need to find out how many green cherries are in the basket. Since there are 5 more green cherries than red ones, the number of green cherries must be equal to 15 - 10 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green cherries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 3 red cherries and more than 10 green cherries in the basket. So, if we have x green cherries, then we must have at least 10 + x green cherries in total. Therefore, the number of green cherries in the basket is between 10 and 23 (inclusive). Since we cannot have a fractional number of green cherries, the exact value of x is either 10, 11, 12,..., 23. Thus, the answer is 11 green cherries in the basket.
Response:  Red mangoes = 7 x 1 = 7 Yellow mangoes = 15 x 1 = 15 Green mangoes = 8 x 1 = 8 Total number of mangoes in the basket = 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 So there are 30 mangoes in total in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 7 red cherries, 71 yellow cherries, and 8 green cherries in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation:  7 + 71 = x (where x is the number of green cherries) Since there are more than 70 yellow cherries than red cherries, we know that x > 7. Therefore, the number of green cherries in the basket is greater than 7. To find out exactly how many more, we can subtract 7 from x: x - 7 = 15 So, there are 15 more green cherries than red cherries in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 2 red cherries and 6 yellow cherries in total. So far, we have 8 cherries (2 + 6). Now, let's count the green cherries. There are 14 green cherries, so we add them to our total: 8 + 14 = 22 cherries. Therefore, there are 22 - 6 = 16 green cherries more than yellow cherries.
Response:  We know that there are 19 red cherries and 11 yellow cherries in total. So, if we subtract the number of yellow cherries (11) from the total number of cherries (30), we get:  30 - 11 = 19  Therefore, there are 19 more red cherries than yellow ones.
Response:  We know that there are 6 red cherries and 16 green cherries in the basket. So, if we combine them, there will be a total of 6 + 16 = 22 cherries. Therefore, the answer is 22.
Response:  We know that there are 18 red cherries and 14 yellow cherries in total. So, if we combine them, there will be 18 + 14 = 32 cherries altogether. Therefore, the number of cherries in the basket is 32.
Response:  We know that there are 5 red cherries and 14 yellow cherries in the basket. So far, we have a total of 5 + 14 = 19 cherries. Now, we also know that some of these cherries are green. There are 6 green cherries in the basket. Since each basket can hold only one type of fruit at a time, we cannot count the green cherries twice. Therefore, the number of cherries in the basket is 19 - 6 = 13.
Response:  We know that there are 65 containers in total.  Each container has either red or green mangoes. So, the total number of red mangoes is 7 x 65 = 455, and the total number of green mangoes is 3 x 65 = 195. Therefore, the total number of mangoes in all containers is 455 + 195 = 650.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 baskets in total. Each basket has either red or green mangoes. So, we can write this as follows:
Red Mangoes: 10 x 11 = 110
Green Mangoes: 18 x 11 = 208
Total Mangoes: 110 + 208 = 318
Therefore, there are 318 mangoes in total."
"Response:  We have 6 boxes (籠) in total. Inside each box, there are either red or green mangoes. The number of red mangoes is given as 16, and the number of green mangoes is given as 18. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:
Red mangoes = 16 Green mangoes = 18 Total mangoes = Red + Green = 16 + 18 = 34
Therefore, the total number of mangoes inside all six boxes is 34."
Response:  There are 7 baskets in total. Each basket has either red or green peaches. The number of red peaches is 10 + 10 = 20. So, there are 20 - 2 = 18 green peaches. Therefore, the total number of green peaches is 18.
Response:  We know that there are $ n $ baskets in total, and each basket contains either red or green cherries. The number of red cherries is $ 4n $, and the number of green cherries is $ 3n $. Therefore, the total number of cherries is $ 7n $. So, we can write an equation based on this information: $$ \boxed{7n = 4n + 3n} $$ Now, let's solve for $ n $. Subtracting $ 4n $ from both sides gives us: $$ \boxed{3n = 7} $$ Dividing both sides by $ 3 $ gives us: $$ \boxed{n = 2} $$ Therefore, there are $ 2 $ baskets in total.
Response:  We know that there are total 12 fruits in all baskets. Since each basket has red cherries and green cherries, we can write an equation based on this information: Red cherries = 4 x (number of baskets) Green cherries = Total - Red cherries Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of baskets = 2 Total = 12 Red cherries = 4 x 2 = 8 Green cherries = 12 - 8 = 4 So, there are 4 green cherries in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are total 16 balls in the basket.  Among them, 13 are red and the rest (the remaining) are green. So, the number of green balls is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green balls in the basket.
Response:  If there are 15 baskets of fruit, and each basket contains either red cherries (19) or green grapes (4), then we can calculate the total number of fruits as follows: Red cherries: 15 x 19 = 285 Green grapes: 15 x 4 = 60 Total number of fruits: 285 + 60 = 345 fruits in all the baskets.
Response:  We know that there are 10 balls in total and they are equally distributed among baskets. So, each basket has an equal number of balls, which is 5 ( since we have 10 balls and 4 red balls + 6 green balls = 10). Therefore, there are 5 baskets with red balls and 5 baskets with green balls.
Response:  We know that there are 6 green cherries and 60 yellow cherries in the basket. So, the total number of cherries is 6 + 60 = 66. Now, we need to find out how many more green cherries there are than red cherries. There are 2 red cherries and 66 - 2 = 64 green cherries. Therefore, there are 64 more green cherries than red cherries in the basket.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 4 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added more action figures to the shelf, bringing the total number of action figures to 8. So, Jerry added 4 + 4 = 8 action figures to his shelf in total.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures in his room (as mentioned in the question). Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so now he has a total of 10 action figures. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 4 action figures and 22 books on the shelf. Later, he added another 6 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, there are:  Initially (Jerry's first placement): 4 x $ Action Figures = 4 bodies  Books: 22 books Total: 4 + 22 = 26 things Now, let's add the additional 6 action figures that Jerry later placed on the shelf:  New total: 4 + 22 + 6 = 32 objects Therefore, there are 32 action figures and 22 books on the shelf in total.
Response:  At first, Jerry placed 5 action figures and 9 books on the shelf. Later, he added another 7 action figures to the shelf. So, in total, how many action figures are there on the shelf? We can count them as follows:  Initially, there were 5 action figures + 7 additional action figures = 12 action figures in total. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on his shelf. Then he added another 4 action figures to the shelf. So, initially, there were 2 + 10 = 12 items in total on the shelf. After that, he added more action figures, so the number of items increased to 12 + 4 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 books on Jerry's shelf now.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 9 books on the shelf and later added another 10 books to it. So, in total, there are 9 + 10 = 19 books on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 7 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added 4 more books to the shelf, but not any more action figures. So, at this point, there are 7 + 2 = 9 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 5 action figures and 2 books on his shelf. Later, he added another 9 books to the shelf. So, in total, how many books are now on Jerry's shelf? We can count them as follows: Initially, there were 2 books + 5 action figures = 7 items on the shelf (books + action figures). Later, Jerry added 9 more books, so the new total is 7 + 9 = 16 books on the shelf. Therefore, there are 16 books on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 8 action figures on the shelf. Later, he added 4 more and removed 5 old ones, for a total of 13 action figures on the shelf (8 + 4 - 5 = 13). So, there are 13 action figures on the shelf.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 3 action figures on the shelf and later added 4 more. So, in total, he had 7 action figures (3 + 4 = 7) on the shelf at one point. Then, he removed some of them to make room for new ones, but we don't know how many exactly. Therefore, the final number of action figures on the shelf is still unknown.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures in his room. Then he added some more and took away some old ones, so the total number of action figures in his room is now 8. So, Jerry added 3 new action figures to his collection (7 + 3 = 10).
Response:  At first, Jerry had 5 action figures in his room (as mentioned in the question). Later, he added 3 more action figures to the shelf and removed 4 old ones, leaving him with 10 action figures now. So, initially, Jerry had 5 action figures in his room.
Response:  Jerry initially placed 9 action figures on his shelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so there are now 9 + 7 = 16 action figures in total on the shelf. Additionally, Jerry has 10 books on his shelf. Since we know that there are more action figures than books, this means that for every book on the shelf, there are more than 2 action figures (since 10 / 2 = 5). Therefore, there are at least 16 + 5 = 21 action figures on Jerry's shelf.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures in his room. Then he added 2 more action figures to the collection. So, initially there were 3 + 4 = 7 items in total. After adding two more action figures, the new total number of items is 7 + 2 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 action figures in Jerry's room now.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures in his room. Then he added 2 more action figures to make it 5. So initially, there were 7 + 3 = 10 items in total. After adding two more action figures, the number of items increased to 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 books and 5 action figures in Jerry's room.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, some more birds joined them, making it a total of 6 birds. So, to find out how many more birds came to sit on the fence, we need to subtract the initial number of birds from the current number of birds. Therefore, the answer is: 6 - 2 = 4 more birds came to sit on the fence.
Response:  At first, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence (birds A, B, and C). Then, 4 more birds joined them (dogs D, E, F, and G). So, in total, there are now 5 birds on the fence. Therefore, the number of birds that originally sat on the fence is 3.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 birds and 46 cranes sitting on the fence, so the total number of birds was 4 + 46 = 50. Then, 6 more birds joined the fence, making the total number of birds 50 + 6 = 56. Therefore, the answer is 56 birds are sitting on the fence.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds and 2 cranes sitting on the fence. So, in total, there were 5 creatures (birds + cranes) sitting on the fence initially. Then, 5 more birds joined them. Therefore, the total number of creatures sitting on the fence now is: 5 (initial) + 5 = 10. So, there are 10 creatures sitting on the fence altogether.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds and 4 cranes sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 3 + 2 = 5 Cranes = 4 Therefore, there are 5 birds and 4 cranes sitting on the fence.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 cranes sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 2 + 3 = 5 Cranes = 6 Now, let's count how many cranes are present among all the birds and cranes: Total number of cranes = 6 (already present) + 3 (newly arrived) = 9 Therefore, there are 9 cranes present among all the birds and cranes sitting on the fence.
"Response:  Firstly, there are 4 birds of species ""bird"" already sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds of the same species join them, making it a total of 6 birds of the species ""bird"" sitting on the fence. Finally, we have 3 birds of the species ""raven"" joining them, so now there are 9 birds in total sitting on the fence (including both bird and raven). Therefore, the answer is 9."
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds and 4 cranes sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more cranes joined them. So, in total, there are: Birds: 3 + 6 = 9 Cranes: 4 + 6 = 10 Therefore, there are 9 birds and 10 cranes sitting on the fence in total.
Response:  Initially, there were 6 birds and 3 cranes sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more cranes joined them. So, in total, there are now: 6 + 3 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  Initially, there were 4 birds and 3 cranes sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more cranes joined them. So, in total, we have: Birds = 4 + 6 = 10 Cranes = 3 + 6 = 9 Therefore, there are 10 birds and 9 cranes sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 6 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds joined, making it 10 in total. Finally, 8 cranes arrived, bringing the total number of birds to 18. So, the answer is 18.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds and 4 cranes joined them. So, in total, how many birds are sitting on the fence? We can count like this: 2 + 5 = 7 (birds) + 4 (cranes) = 11 birds in total. Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 2 more birds and 6 more cranes joined them. So, in total, how many birds are now sitting on the fence? The answer is: 3 + 2 = 5 birds + 6 = 11 birds. Therefore, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence.
Response:  At first, there were 5 birds in total (birds + added 4). So, at this point, the number of birds was 5 + 4 = 9. Then, 3 more birds joined, so now we have 9 + 3 = 12 birds in total. Therefore, the fence has 12 birds.
Response:  Initially, there were 6 crows and 2 other birds sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds joined them. So, in total, we have:  6 + 2 = 8 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 8 crow plus the 3 new birds joining them, which is equal to 11 birds in total sitting on the fence.
Response:  Initially, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 6 cranes and 2 other birds joined them. So, in total, we have: 3 + 6 = 9 birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  First chapter has 48 pages and second chapter has 11 pages. So total number of pages in first chapter is 48 + 11 = 59 pages. Therefore, first chapter has 59 pages more than second chapter.
Response:  First chapter has 37 pages, and second chapter has 80 pages. So, total number of pages in two chapters is: Chapter 1: 37 + Chapter 2: 80 = 117 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in the second chapter and the first chapter is: 80 - 37 = 43 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 60 pages, and total number of pages in the book is 93 pages. So, second chapter will have (93 - 60) = 33 pages.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and the second chapter is 36 pages long, we can say that the total number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages in the book - Number of pages in the second chapter. So, the number of pages in the first chapter = 67 - 36 = 31 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 31 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 66 pages, second chapter has 35 pages, and third chapter has 24 pages. So, total number of pages in the book is: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages.
Response:  First chapter has 91 pages, second chapter has 23 pages, and third chapter has 25 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Chapter 1: 91 pages - Second chapter: 23 pages = 68 pages Third chapter: 25 pages = 53 pages Therefore, the first chapter is 68 pages long, which is more than the second chapter by 45 pages (68 - 23 = 45).
Response:  First chapter has 35 pages, second chapter has 18 pages, and third chapter has 3 pages. So, total number of pages is: Chapter 1 - 35 pages Chapter 2 - 18 pages + 3 pages = 21 pages Therefore, the second chapter has 21 pages more than the third chapter.
Response:  First chapter is 53 pages long and second chapter is 75 pages long. So total number of pages in first two chapters = 53 + 75 = 128 pages. Now we know that third chapter is 21 pages long, so total number of pages in three chapters = 128 + 21 = 149 pages. Therefore, first chapter is 149 - 21 = 128 pages longer than third chapter.
Response:  If there are 31 chapters in the book and each chapter is 61 pages long, then we can calculate the total number of pages as follows: Total Number of Pages = Number of Chapters x Length of Each Chapter Total Number of Pages = 31 x 61 Total Number of Pages = 1931 pages So, there are approximately 1931 pages in the book.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 23 pages, we can calculate the number of pages in the first chapter as follows: Number of pages in Chapter 1 = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if there are 23 pages in each chapter, and there are 2 chapters, then the total number of pages in the book is: Total number of pages = Number of pages in Chapter 1 x Number of chapters = 23 x 2 = 46 pages Therefore, the first chapter has 46 pages.
Response:  According to the question, there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has 81 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages of the first chapter from the total number of pages of the book, we will get the number of pages of the second chapter. Therefore, the number of pages of the second chapter is: 81 - 68 = 13 pages.
Response:  In the morning, there were 62 campers in boats.  After lunch, there were 39 campers in boats. So, the difference between the number of campers in the morning and afternoon is:  62 - 39 = 23 people. Therefore, during the afternoon, there were 23 more campers in boats than in the morning.
Response:  At noon, there were 52 campers in the boat.  After lunch, there were 61 campers in the boat. So, the difference between the number of campers at noon and after lunch is:  61 - 52 = 9 people. Therefore, during the afternoon, 9 more campers got onto the boat than during the morning.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 campers in the boat at noon. Then, more campers got on the boat later in the day. So, we need to find out how many campers got on the boat after noon. Let's assume that x is the number of campers who got on the boat after noon. Since there are a total of 32 campers on the boat, we can write the equation: 15 + x = 32. Now, solve for x using basic arithmetic: x = 17. Therefore, there were 17 additional campers who got on the boat after noon.
Response:  If 8 campers went fishing in the morning and 7 more in the afternoon, then the total number of campers who went fishing that day is: 8 + 7 = 15 Therefore, 15 campers went fishing that day.
Response:  In the morning, 36 campers boarded the boat, so there are 36 people in total.  In the afternoon, 13 more campers boarded the boat, bringing the total number of people to 50 (36 + 13). Finally, at night, another 49 campers boarded the boat, making the total number of people 100 (50 + 49). Therefore, the answer is 100.
Response:  During lunchtime (12 pm), there were 44 campers in the boat.  After lunch (1 pm), there were 39 campers in the boat.  And after dinner (8 pm), there were 31 campers in the boat. So, during lunchtime, there were more campers in the boat than after dinner. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers in the boat during lunchtime and after dinner is:  44 - 31 = 13 people.
Response:  In the morning, there were 53 campers in the boat. Then, in the afternoon, there were 48 campers in the boat. Finally, at night, there were 49 campers in the boat. So, the difference between the number of campers in the morning and those at night is:  53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, during the daytime, 5 more campers got on the boat than at night.
Response:  At noon, there are 33 campers in the boat.  At night, there are 10 additional campers in the boat, for a total of 43 campers. So, compared to noon, there are 10 more campers in the boat at night.
Response:  At noon, there were 13 campers in the boat. In the afternoon, 21 more campers got onto the boat, so the total number of campers on the boat at that time was 13 + 21 = 34. Therefore, a total of 34 campers went on the boat during the day.
Response:  In the morning, there were 29 campers in boats and 66 campers going hiking.  In the afternoon, there were 26 campers in boats. So, the difference between the number of campers in boats in the afternoon and the morning is:  26 - 29 = -3. Therefore, there were 3 fewer campers in boats in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  At noon, there were 41 campers in boats and 4 campers went hiking. So, the total number of campers at noon was 41 + 4 = 45.  In the afternoon, there were 26 campers in boats. So, the total number of campers in the afternoon was 45 + 26 = 71. Therefore, the total number of campers who went boating or hiking was 71.
Response:  We know that in the morning, 43 campers got on the boat. So, there are 43 - 46 = -3 campers who did not get on the boat in the morning. In the afternoon, some additional campers got on the boat, but we don't know how many. Therefore, the number of campers who got on the boat in the afternoon is between -3 and 43 (inclusive). Since there are only 46 total campers, the maximum number of campers who could have gotten on the boat in the afternoon is 43 + (-3) = 40. So, the answer is 40.

Response:  Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from the tree. Now, there are still 5 apples left on the tree. Among these 5 apples, 3 are ripe and 2 are unripe. So, the number of unripe apples is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked two ripe apples from the tree. So, there were 7 - 2 = 5 unripe apples left on the tree. Now, we know that 6 of them are ripe and 1 is unripe. Therefore, the number of ripe apples on the tree initially was 6.
Response:  Initially, Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from the tree. So, there were 6 - 2 = 4 unripe apples in the tree initially.
Response:  Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree. Now there are 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples in the tree. So initially, there were 3 + 2 = 5 ripe apples in the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. So, there were 7 apples in the tree initially. Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree after Rachel picked the initial 7. Therefore, the total number of apples in the tree now is 7 + 2 = 9 apples. So, the correct answer is 9.
Response:  Initially, there were 2 apples in Rachel's tree. She picked 4 apples from the tree. So, after she picked the apples, there were 2 - 4 = 0 apples left in the tree. Then, new apples grew on the tree, and there are now 3 additional apples. Therefore, the final number of apples in Rachel's tree is 0 + 3 = 3 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 52 apples in her bag. She picked 2 of them, so she has 52 - 2 = 50 apples left. Now, there are still 7 apples on the tree. Therefore, the initial number of apples on the tree was 7 + 50 = 57 apples.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 3 trees with a total of 3 x 3 = 9 apples. Then she picked 8 apples from each tree, so she removed 8 x 3 = 24 apples. Now there are only 9 - 24 = -15 apples left in all the trees. Therefore, initially there were 9 apples in each tree.
Response:  Rachel has 4 trees and each tree has 7 apples. So, she picked 7 x 4 = 28 apples from all the trees together. Now, there are 29 - 28 = 1 apple left in all the trees combined. Therefore, Rachel picked 1 apple.
Response:  Ed has more than Doug in beads initially. So, if Ed had x beads and Doug had y beads, then we can write an equation as follows: x > y. Now, after playing at the playground, Doug lost some beads. We know that Ed gained 19 beads from Doug, so we can write another equation as follows: x + 19 > y. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get x = 20 and y = 16. Therefore, Doug lost 16 beads.
Response:  Ed has 45 beads and loses 3 beads. So he now has 42 beads. Doug has 11 beads and loses 2 beads. So he now has 9 beads. Now we need to find out how many more beads Ed has than Doug. To do this, we can divide the number of beads that Ed has (42) by the number of beads that Doug has (9). This gives us an answer of 5. Therefore, Ed has 5 more beads than Doug.
Response:  Ed has 22 beads and loses 3 to Doug. So, Ed now has 19 beads. Then, Doug loses 7 beads at the playground. Therefore, Doug now has 12 beads (19 - 7 = 12).
Response:  Ed has 27 beads and loses 3 of them at the playground. So, Ed now has 24 beads. Then, Doug loses 3 beads, so he has 0 beads left. Therefore, Doug had 3 beads initially.
Response:  Ed had 30 beads initially (more than Doug). Then, Ed found 9 additional beads, and Doug lost 27 beads. So, Ed has now 30 + 9 = 39 beads in total. Therefore, Ed has 39 - 27 = 12 more beads than Doug.
Response:  Ed had 30 beads initially and lost 17 of them at the playground. So, Ed now has 30 - 17 = 13 beads left. Now, let's compare this number with Doug who had 29 beads initially. Therefore, Ed has more beads than Doug, i.e., 13 > 29, so Ed has 13 + 29 = 42 beads in total.
Response:  Ed had 27 beads initially (more than Doug). Then he lost some beads at the playground. After that, he still has 8 more beads than Doug. So, if Ed had x beads initially, then after losing some beads, he had x - 8 beads. Since Ed now has 20 beads (more than Doug), we can set up the equation: x - 8 = 20. Solving for x, we get: x = 28. Therefore, Ed lost 8 beads.
Response:  Ed had 91 beads initially and lost 21 beads at the playground. So, he has 91 - 21 = 70 beads left with him. Now, let's compare this number with Doug who had 60 beads initially. Therefore, Ed has 70 - 60 = 10 more beads than Doug.
Response:  Ed had 39 beads initially (12 more than Doug). Then, Ed lost 20 beads at the playground, leaving him with 17 beads. So, if Ed had 17 beads, then Doug must have had x beads initially, where x is the difference between Ed's initial beads and his remaining beads after losing some at the playground. Therefore, Doug had 39 - 17 = 22 beads initially.
"Response: 
So, Sofia decided to ask each student for their specific food suggestions. If 408 students suggested mashed potatoes and 42 students suggested adding bacon to the menu, then how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon?
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes (408) and the number of students who suggested bacon (42). So, the answer is:

Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon = 408 - 42 = 366
Therefore, there are 366 more students who suggested mashed potatoes than bacon."
"Response: 
Suppose there are x students who proposed adding beef to the menu. Since 479 students proposed adding mashed potatoes and 489 students proposed adding beef, we can write an equation: 
x + 479 = 489
Now, let's solve for x: 
x = 489 - 479 = 90
So, there were 90 students who proposed adding beef to the menu."
Response:  According to the question, Sofia asked 310 students for their suggestions regarding specific food items to be included in the menu. Among these students, 185 suggested adding mashed potatoes and 75 suggested adding bacon. So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 75.
Response:  According to the question, Sofia decided to provide specific food options for 288 students. Of these students, 264 proposed adding beef to the menu, while the remaining 14 proposed adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, there were 14 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes.
Response:  We know that out of 457 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes to the menu, 63 were from this group. So, the number of students who proposed adding beef to the menu is 457 - 63 = 404.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 182 students who proposed adding something to the menu, 166 students proposed adding beef. So, the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes is 16 - (166/182) = 10. Therefore, there are 10 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sofia asked for suggestions from students regarding specific food items to be added to the menu. Then, she received 324 suggestions for mashed potatoes, 374 suggestions for bacon, and 128 suggestions for tomato. So, in total, there were 826 suggestions made by students. Now, let's find out how many students participated in this activity. To do so, we need to divide the number of suggestions by the total number of students (which is given as 324 + 374 + 128 = 826). Therefore, the number of students who participated in the activity is:  Number of students = Total number of suggestions / Total number of students = 826 / 826 = 100%  So, all 324 + 374 + 128 = 826 students participated in the activity.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 257 students who proposed an additional food item, 120 proposed beef. So, the number of students who proposed mashed potatoes is 137 (257 - 120). Now, among these 137 students who proposed mashed potatoes, how many also proposed beef? Well, since they are the same people, all 137 of them proposed beef. Therefore, the number of students who proposed both mashed potatoes and beef is 137.  Finally, among the remaining 97 students who did not propose either mashed potatoes or beef, 97 proposed tomato.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students who proposed each food item.  For mashed potatoes, 144 students proposed it, so the total number is 144.  For beef, 467 students proposed it, so the total number is 467.  For tomato, 79 students proposed it, so the total number is 79.  Now, let's compare the number of students who proposed each food item with the number of students who proposed tomato.  The number of students who proposed tomato is less than the number of students who proposed any other food item, so the answer is (79) - (144 + 467) = -258. Therefore, there are 258 more students who proposed tomato than those who proposed mashed potatoes or beef.
Response:  We know that out of 228 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes to the menu, 337 students proposed adding bacon to the menu. So, the total number of students who proposed adding some type of meat (bacon or mashed potatoes) is 337 + 228 = 565 students. Now, we are asked how many more students proposed adding bacon than proposed adding tomato. Well, among the 23 students who proposed adding tomato, only 3 also proposed adding bacon (since they could have just suggested tomato without mentioning bacon). Therefore, the difference between the number of students who proposed adding bacon and those who proposed adding tomato is 3 - 2 = 1 student.
"Response: 
So, Sofia decided to ask students for specific food suggestions from among the 66 types available. Among those who suggested adding mashed potatoes (450 students) and bacon (38 students), how many students did not participate in suggesting new food items if they had been asked?  To find this number, we need to subtract the total number of students who participated in suggesting new food items from the total number of students in the class.  Therefore, the number of students who did not participate in suggesting new food items is:  
Total number of students = 450 + 38 = 488
Therefore, if all students were asked to suggest new food items, there would be 488 students who did not participate."
Response:  If Sophia decided to add beef to the menu based on the suggestions of 218 students who proposed adding mashed potatoes and beef, then the number of students who suggested adding beef only is 351 - 218 = 133.
Response:  We know that out of 269 students who proposed adding beef to the menu, 330 students proposed adding mashed potatoes. So, the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who proposed adding beef. Therefore, the number of students who proposed adding mashed potatoes minus the number of students who proposed adding beef is equal to 76 (the number of students who proposed adding tomato).  So, the difference between these two numbers is 76.
Response:  Number of female students = 569 Number of male students = 236 Difference between number of female and male students = Female students - Male students = 569 - 236 = 333 Therefore, there are 333 more female than male students in the school.
Response:  Number of female students = 34 Number of male students = 841 - 34 = 807 Therefore, there are 807 males for every 34 females in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 485 students in total and 232 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 female students in total and they are more than twice as many as male students. So, if x is the number of male students, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of male students = (Total number of students - Female students) / 2  Number of male students = 697 - 228 / 2  Number of male students = 469 Now, we have to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. To do so, we can substitute x = 469 into the equation and see whether it works: 469 = (697 - 228) / 2 469 = 469 / 2 469 = 234 Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 female students in the school and 510 more male students than females. So, the total number of male students is: Male Students = Female Students + (Female Students x Rate) Male Students = 635 + (635 x 510/635) Male Students = 635 + 827.5 = 1462.5 Therefore, there are 1462.5 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 868 female students and 587 male students in total. Since the number of female students is 281 more than the number of male students, we can write an equation as follows: Female Students = Male Students + 281 Now, let's solve for the total number of students (S): S = Female Students + Male Students Substituting the values given in the question, we get: S = 868 + 587 = 1455 Therefore, there are 1455 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 female students and 142 more male students than females. So, the total number of students in the school is: 700 + (142 - 700) = 368  Therefore, there are 368 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 706 female students in school and 222 male students. Then, 418 more females joined the school, so the total number of female students is now: 706 + 418 = 1124 female students. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of male students as follows: 222 + (418 - 222) = 658 male students. Therefore, there are currently 1124 female students and 658 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 female students and 811 male students in the school. Then, 44 more females joined the school, so the total number of female students now is: 902 + 44 = 946 female students. Therefore, the current number of female students in the school is 946.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 632 female students in the school and 410 male students. So, the total number of students is 632 + 410 = 1042.  Now, we are told that 465 additional female students have joined the school. Therefore, the new total number of female students is 632 + 465 = 1097. Since we already knew that there were 410 male students, the total number of male students remains unchanged at 410. So, the ratio of female to male students is: 1097 - 410 = 687 females to every 410 males.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 732 female students in the school initially. Then, 682 more females joined the school later, so the total number of female students now is: 732 + 682 = 1414. Therefore, the number of female students currently in the school is 1414.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 135 female students in the school initially. Then, 496 more female students join the school, so the total number of female students now is: 135 + 496 = 631. Similarly, we can calculate the number of male students as follows: Initially, there are 214 male students in the school. Later, 910 male students join the school, so the total number of male students now is: 214 + 910 = 1124. Therefore, the current number of male students in the school is 1124.
Response:  Number of female students = 308 Number of male students = 318 Total number of students = Female + Male = 308 + 318 = 626 Therefore, there are 626 students in this school.
Response:  Number of female students = 315 Number of male students = 309 Total number of students = Female + Male = 315 + 309 = 624 Number of teachers = 772 Therefore, the total number of people in the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1,496
Response:  We know that there are 402 more female students than male students in the school. So, if there are x male students, then there are x + 402 female students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 402 = 739 (1) Now, let's solve for x. Subtracting 402 from both sides of Equation (1), we get: x = 337 (2) Thus, there are 337 male students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 458 more female students than male students in the school. So, if there are x male students in the school, then there are x + 458 female students. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 458 = 1350 (since there are 1350 total students in the school). Now, solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method. Solution: To find out how many male students are in the school, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation: x = 1350 - 458 = 892. Therefore, there are 892 male students in the school.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 362 male students in school and 257 female students in school initially. Then, 403 more females join the school, so the total number of female students is now 403 + 257 = 660. Therefore, the difference between the number of males and females in the school is: 660 - 362 = 318.

Response:  Edwatrd spent $16 to buy 92 books, which means he paid $0.18 per book ($16 / 92). Now, he has $6 left after buying the books. To find out how much money Edward had before buying the books, we can subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $6 = $16 - $0.18 x 92 So, Edward had $15.82 before buying the books.
Response:  Edward spent $6 to buy two books, so he had $6 + $6 = $12 left after buying the books. Therefore, each book cost $12 / 2 = $6.
Response:  Edwatrd spent $6 to buy a book and $16 to buy a pen. So he has $19 left after buying those things. To find out how much money Edward had before buying anything, we need to subtract the amount he spent from his initial balance. Therefore, the answer is: $19 - $6 = $13.
Response:  Edwatd spent $4 to buy a book and $3 to buy a pen, so he spent a total of $7. Now, he has $12 left. So, Edward used $5 of his money ($12 - $7 = $5) to buy the book and pen.

Response: ザカリー (Zakari) did 44 push-ups in today's physical education class. David did more than Zakari, with 58 push-ups. So together they did how many push-ups? We can start by adding their numbers: 44 + 58 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, Zakari and David together did 102 push-ups.
Response: ザカリー (Zakari) did 51 repetitions of push-ups in today's physical education class. David did 44 repetitions of push-ups. To find out how many more times Zakari did than David, we need to subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the number of push-ups that Zakari did. So, the answer is: 51 - 44 = 7. Therefore, Zakari did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  David did 44 push-ups today in gym class. Since David did more than Zachary (by 9), we can say that Zachary did x push-ups. So, the equation is: 44 = x + 9. Solving for x, we get : x = 35. Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups today.
Response:  David did 51 push-ups today in gym class. Since David did more than Zachary (by 49 push-ups), we can write:  David = 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups more than Zachary. So, together they did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups.
"Response:  We know that Zakari has done 59 sit-ups and 44 push-ups. David did more sit-ups than Zakari (by 19) but fewer push-ups (by 27). So, we can write down an equation:

Zakari did x sit-ups and y push-ups.
David did x + 19 sit-ups and y - 27 push-ups.
We are told that David did 19 more sit-ups than Zakari, so x = 59. And since David did 27 fewer push-ups than Zakari, y = 44. Therefore, David did 59 + 19 = 78 sit-ups and 44 - 27 = 17 push-ups."
Response:  We know that Zakari has done 44 push-ups and 17 crunches. David did more push-ups than Zakari (by 29). So, David did 73 push-ups (44 + 29 = 73). Now, we need to find out how many crunches David did. Since David did fewer crunches than Zakari (by 13), David did 60 crunches (17 - 13 = 60). Therefore, David did 73 push-ups and 60 crunches in total.
Response:  We know that Zakari has done 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. David did more push-ups than Zakari (by 17) but fewer crunches (by 10). So, we can write down the following equations: Push-ups: Zakari = 53 David = x Crunches: Zakari = 14 David = y Where x and y are unknown numbers. Now we have two equations and two variables. Can you solve for x and y?
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Zakari has done 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. 
Secondly, David did more push-ups than Zakari (by 23 times). So, David did 35 x 23 = 795 push-ups. 
Lastly, David did fewer crunches than Zakari (by 14 times). So, David did 3 x 14 = 42 crunches. Therefore, the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches done by Zakari and David is: 795 - 42 = 753."
"Response: 
Zakariya did 46 rounds of push-ups and 58 rounds of sit-ups. 
David did 38 more push-ups than Zakariya but fewer sit-ups than him. 
So, David did 38 + 58 = 96 rounds of exercise in total. 
Therefore, Zakariya did 46 - 96 = -50 rounds of sit-ups more than David."
Response:  We know that Zakari has done 19 arm curls in today's physical education class. David did more than Zakari but fewer than John. So, David did x + 19 = 39 arm curls. Since John did fewer than David, he did x - 13 = 26 arm curls. Now we can solve for x using basic arithmetic: x + 19 = 39 x - 13 = 26 x = 54 Therefore, David did 54 arm curls in today's physical education class.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups in today's physical education class. David did more than Zachary, which means he did at least 53 push-ups (since 51 + 2 = 53). John did fewer push-ups than David, which means he did 4 less than David, or 49 push-ups (since 53 - 4 = 49). So, John did 49 push-ups in today's physical education class.
Response:  We know that Zakari has done 15 push-ups, David has done 48 more than Zakari (i.e., 48 + 15 = 63), and John has done 9 fewer than David (i.e., 63 - 9 = 54). Therefore, Zakari did 54 push-ups.
Response:  David did 30 more arm curls than Zachary today in gym class. So if Zachary did x arm curls, then David did 3x arm curls. Since David did 37 arm curls, we can set up the equation: 3x = 37. Solving for x, we get: x = 11. Therefore, Zachary did 11 arm curls today in gym class.
Response:  David did 56 more sit-ups than Zachary. So, if David did 38 sit-ups, then Zachary did x = 38 - 56 = 20 sit-ups. Therefore, the total number of sit-ups done by both David and Zachary is 38 + 20 = 58 sit-ups.
Response:  David did 40 more sit-ups than Zachary and 17 fewer crunches. So if Zachary did 34 sit-ups and 62 crunches, then David did ______ crunches.  Solution:  If Zachary did 34 sit-ups and 62 crunches, then David did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches.
Response:  David did 36 more arm curls than Zachary. So if Zachary did 58 arm curls, then David did 58 + 36 = 94 arm curls. Therefore, Zachary did 58 - 36 = 22 fewer arm curls than David.
Response:  David did 27 more sit-ups than Zachary and 7 fewer crunches. If Zachary did 5 sit-ups and 17 crunches, then Zachary did how many more crunches than sit-ups?  We can set up an equation to represent this situation:  David did x more crunches than sit-ups, and Zachary did y more crunches than sit-ups. Since David did 27 more sit-ups than Zachary, we know that x = 27. Similarly, since Zachary did 7 fewer crunches than David, we know that y = 7. So, the difference between the number of crunches Zachary did and the number of sit-ups he did is 7. Therefore, Zachary did 7 + 17 = 24 more crunches than sit-ups.
Response:  Rachel completed 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading homework. So, the difference between the number of pages she completed for math and reading is: 5 - 2 = 3 pages. Therefore, the number of pages more than Rachel completed for math homework is 3 pages.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. Since the reading homework is longer than the math homework, we can conclude that the difference between the number of pages of reading homework and math homework is 1 page. Therefore, the number of pages of reading homework is 4 - 1 = 3 pages. So, the answer is 3 pages.
Response:  Rachel has to complete 7 pages of homework in total, and she has already completed 5 pages of math homework. Therefore, she needs to complete an additional 2 pages of reading homework (7 - 5 = 2). So, Rachel has completed 2 pages of reading homework.
Response:  Rachel did not complete her math homework if she read more than 3 pages of reading assignments. So, if Rachel completed 7 pages of math homework, then she must have read less than 7 - 3 = 4 pages of reading assignments. Therefore, Rachel read 4 pages of reading assignments.
Response:  Rachel completed 8 pages of math homework and read 5 pages of reading homework. So, she has completed a total of 13 pages (8 + 5).
Response:  If Rachel completed 8 pages of math homework and she needed to complete at least 6 more pages than her math homework, then she would have completed 14 pages (8 + 6) of homework in total. So, she did not complete any reading assignments.
Response:  If Rachel completed 10 pages of math homework and she had to complete either 3 more pages of reading homework or 7 more pages of math homework, then we can calculate her total number of pages completed as follows:  Total pages completed = Math homework + Reading homework - (Math homework / 2) In this case, if Rachel completed 10 pages of math homework, she would have to complete either 3 more pages of reading homework or 7 more pages of math homework. So, let's assume that she completed 3 more pages of reading homework. Therefore, her total number of pages completed would be: Total pages completed = 10 + 3 - (10 / 2) = 15 pages Completed.
"Response: 
Rachel has to do 2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading comprehension, and 10 pages of biology homework. In total, she needs to complete how many pages?
To find out, we need to add up the number of pages for each assignment:
2 pages + 3 pages + 10 pages = 15 pages
So Rachel needs to complete 15 pages in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to do 9 pages of math homework, which is less than the number of pages she has to read for her reading assignment (2 pages). Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she has to read and the number of pages she has to do in math is 9 - 2 = 7 pages. Now, let's consider the biology assignment. We are told that Rachel has to do an additional 96 pages beyond what she has already done in math and reading combined. So, if she has already done 7 pages in math and 2 pages in reading, then she still has to do 96 - 7 - 2 = 89 pages more in biology.
Response:  According to the question, Rachel has 11 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework, and additional biology homework of 3 pages more than math homework. So, if we calculate the total number of pages for each subject, we get: Math: 11 pages Biology: 11 + 3 = 14 pages Reading: 2 pages Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and biology homework is 14 - 11 = 3 pages.
Response:  Firstly, Rachel has to complete 7 pages of math homework. Then, she has to read 11 pages of reading comprehension and write a summary for each page. Finally, she has to do additional biology homework which is 8 pages more than the reading comprehension homework. So, in total, Rachel has to complete 7 + 11 + (8) = 26 pages of homework. Therefore, the answer is 26 pages.
Response:  Rachel has completed 9 pages of math homework and 11 pages of reading homework. To find out how many pages she has completed in total, we can add these two numbers together: 9 + 11 = 20 pages. So, Rachel has completed 20 pages of homework.
Response:  Rachel has to do 8 pages of math homework and 7 pages of reading homework. In addition, she has to do 3 pages of biology homework. So, in total, Rachel has to do 8 + 7 = 15 pages of homework.
"Response: 
Rachel has to do 5 pages of math homework, and each page contains 2 problems, so she needs to solve 10 math problems in total. 
For reading assignments, Rachel has to read 10 pages, but each page contains 3 questions, so she needs to answer 30 questions in total. 
Finally, for biology assignments, Rachel has to complete 6 pages, and each page contains 4 questions, so she needs to answer 24 questions in total.  Therefore, the total number of pages that Rachel needs to complete is:  
Math: 10 pages x 2 problems/page = 20 problems Total: 10 + 20 = 30 pages  Biology: 6 pages x 4 questions/page = 24 questions Total: 6 + 24 = 30 pages  So, Rachel needs to complete 30 pages of homework in total."
Response:  According to the question, Rachel completed 2 pages of reading homework and 4 pages of math homework. So, the total number of pages she completed is 2 + 4 = 6 pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework is 6 - 2 = 4 pages.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rachel has to complete 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of math homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is: 4 + 7 = 11 pages. Now, we are told that she also has to complete 19 pages of biology homework. So, in addition to the 11 pages she already needs to complete, she will have to do an additional 19 - 11 = 8 pages of work. Hence, the final answer is: 11 + 8 = 19 pages.

Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning, then he received 10 emails in the afternoon, and finally, he received 7 emails at night. So, the total number of emails Jack received is: 9 + 10 + 7 = 26 emails. Therefore, Jack received more emails at night than in the morning.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, for a total of 15 emails. In the evening, he received 4 more emails, so the total number of emails he received that day is:  15 + 4 = 19 emails. Therefore, the answer to the question is 19.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, then he received 3 more emails in the afternoon, and finally, he received some more emails at night. So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is: 6 + 3 = 9 emails. Therefore, Jack received 9 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails and 64 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 67 messages (3 + 64 = 67). In the afternoon, he received 5 emails and 54 letters, so he received a total of 59 messages (5 + 54 = 59) for that day. Therefore, Jack received a total of 126 messages (67 + 59 = 126) that day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 11 items (5 + 6 = 11). In the afternoon, he received 9 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 16 items (9 + 7 = 16). Therefore, Jack received a total of 16 letters that day.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 22 messages (10 + 12 = 22). In the afternoon, he received 3 emails and 44 letters, so he received a total of 47 messages (3 + 44 = 47). Therefore, Jack received 25 more messages in the afternoon than he did in the morning (47 - 22 = 25).
Response:  Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning, so he received a total of 6 + 8 = 14 items in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 2 emails and 7 letters, so he received a total of 2 + 7 = 9 items in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received more letters than emails in the afternoon. The difference between the number of letters he received in the morning and the number of letters he received in the afternoon is 14 - 9 = 5 letters. So, Jack received 5 more letters in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
"Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. So, in total, he had 91 + 6 = 97 emails/letters that day.  
In the afternoon, Jack received 2 emails and sent 74 letters. So, in total, he had 97 + 2 = 99 emails/letters that day. Therefore, Jack received 99 emails/letters that day."
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So far, he has sent/received = 4 + 2 = 6 messages.  In the afternoon, Jack received 6 more emails and sent 8 letters. So, in total, he has sent/received = 6 + 8 = 14 messages. Therefore, Jack sent 14 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails that day. In the morning, he received 7 emails, so there are 2 more emails left to be received in the afternoon. Therefore, Jack received 9 - 7 = 2 additional emails in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 3 + 5 = 8 emails during the daytime (morning and afternoon). He also received 16 emails at night, for a total of 8 + 16 = 24 emails. So, during the time period from morning to night, Jack received a total of 24 emails.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, 6 emails in the morning, and additional emails at night. If he received a total of 10 emails that day, then he must have received 3 + 6 = 9 emails during the daytime hours (afternoon + morning). Therefore, he received 1 email in the evening.
Response:  We know that Bat jumped 9 inches and Frog jumped 12 inches. To find out how far away from Bat Frog landed, we need to convert both jumps into the same unit of measurement (e.g., feet). Since an inch is equal to 0.083 feet, we can calculate as follows: Bat's jump distance = 9 x 0.083 = 0.75 feet Frog's jump distance = 12 x 0.083 = 1.008 feet Now, we want to know how far away from Bat Frog landed. So, we subtract Bat's jump distance from Frog's jump distance: Distance = Frog's jump distance - Bat's jump distance = 1.008 - 0.75 = 0.258 feet Therefore, Frog landed 0.258 feet away from Bat.
Response:  Bat jumped 31 inches and frog jumped 35 inches. So, total distance = 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  We know that the kangaroo jumped 36 inches and the frog jumped x inches more than the kangaroo. So, we can write an equation based on this information:  Distance = Kangaroo + (Frog's distance - Kangaroo)  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Distance = 36 + (x - 36)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x = 53  Therefore, the frog jumped 53 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bat jumped 25 inches. Then, we are told that Frog jumped farther than Bat but not as far as Mouse. So, Frog jumped 18 + 2 = 20 inches. Finally, we are told that Mouse jumped farther than Frog. Therefore, Mouse jumped 20 + 2 = 22 inches.  Hence, Mouse jumped 22 inches in total.
Response:  Bat jumped 19 inches (as given in the question).  Frog jumped 10 inches more than bat (since it is farther away from bat). So, frog jumped 29 inches (10 + 19 = 29). Mouse jumped 20 inches more than frog (since it is farther away from frog). So, mouse jumped 49 inches (20 + 29 = 49). Now we need to find out how far bat is from mouse. Since bat is closer to frog than mouse, bat is 10 inches closer to mouse than frog. So, distance between bat and mouse = 49 - 39 = 10 inches.
Response:  We know that the length of the jump made by the frog is 39 inches more than the length of the jump made by the mouse. So, if the mouse jumps x inches, then the frog jumps x + 39 inches. Now, we are told that the distance between the starting point and the end point of the frog's jump is equal to 2 times the length of its jump. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Distance = 2(x + 39) In solving for x, we get: x = 68 inches So, the frog jumps 68 inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bat jumped 25 inches. Then, we are told that Frog jumped farther than Bat, which means Frog jumped 32 - 25 = 8 inches more than Bat. Next, we are given that Mouse jumped less than Frog, which means Mouse jumped 26 - 8 = 18 inches fewer than Frog. Therefore, Mouse jumped 18 inches.
Response:  We know that:  • The length of Kimchi's jump is 24 inches.  • The length of Kael's jump is 33 inches more than Kimchi's jump.  • The length of Mouse's jump is 5 inches less than Kael's jump.  Now we can use these facts to find out how far Mouse jumped:  Distance = Kael's jump - Mouse's jump  = 33 inches - 5 inches  = 28 inches  So, Mouse jumped 28 inches.
Response:  We know that Bat jumped 13 inches and is farther away from Kael than Kael. So, if Kael jumps x inches, then Bat will be y inches away from Kael, where y = x + 13. Now we are given that Kael jumped half of Bat's distance, so Kael jumped (x + 13) / 2 inches. Therefore, Kael jumped 7 inches.
Response:  Bat jumped 35 inches and frog jumped 21 inches. So, total distance = 35 + 21 = 56 inches.
Response:  We know that Bat jumped 19 inches and Mouse jumped 44 inches less than Bat. So, if Bat jumped 19 inches, then Mouse jumped 15 inches (since 44 - 19 = 15). Now, we need to find out how many inches Koi jumped. According to the passage, Koi jumped 4 inches more than Bat. Therefore, Koi jumped 23 inches ( since 19 + 4 = 23).
Response:  Bat jumped 39 inches (or 0.99 meters). Then, we know that bat is farther away from the starting point than frog and mouse combined. So, let's calculate how far each of them jumped: Frog jumped x inches, Mouse jumped y inches. Since frog jumped more than mouse, we can say that x > y. Now, we have two equations: x + y = 39 (from the fact that bat jumped 39 inches) x > y (from the information given in the problem) Can you solve for y?
Response:  We know that:  • The length of Kirli's jump is 21 inches. • The distance between Kirli and the frog is 25 inches. • The distance between Kirli and the mouse is 16 inches. So we can write an equation based on these values: Distance = Length + (Distance between two points) + (Distance between two other points) Now let's substitute the values we have: Distance = 21 + (25 + 16) = 78 inches Therefore, Kirli jumps 78 inches away from the frog.
Response:  We know that Caesar jumped 39 inches and Bat jumped 17 inches. To find out how far away Caesar landed from where he started, we need to subtract the distance Bat traveled (in this case, 17 inches) from the distance Caesar traveled (in this case, 39 inches). So, if Caesar traveled 39 - 17 = 22 inches further than Bat, then Caesar landed 22 inches away from his starting point.
Response:  Bat jumps 9 inches. Mouse jumps less than Bat by 3 inches. Frog jumps more than Bat by 33 inches. So, if we want to find out how many inches Mouse jumped, we can start with the given information and use it to calculate the distance Mouse jumped. Here is the calculation: Distance = (Mouse's jump - Bat's jump) + Bat's jump = (3 - 9) + 9 = -6 inches Therefore, Mouse jumped 6 inches.
"Response:  We know that:  • The length of the jump made by the frog is 37 inches more than the length of the jump made by the mouse. • The length of the jump made by the mouse is 16 inches less than the length of the jump made by the snake. • The length of the jump made by the snake is 14 inches. From these statements, we can deduce the following equations: Snake - Mouse = Frog + 16 (1) Frog - Mouse = Snake + 37 (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: Snake - Mouse = Frog + 37 + 16 = Snake + 53 (3) Solving for ""Frog"", we get: Frog = 53 - Snake - Mouse (4) Now, we are given that the length of the jump made by the snake is 14 inches. So, substituting this value in equation (4), we get: Frog = 53 - 14 - Mouse (5) Finally, we are told that the length of the jump made by the mouse is 6 inches. So, substituting this value in equation (5), we get: Frog = 53 - 14 - 6 = 33 inches Therefore, the distance between the frog and the mouse is 33 inches."
Response:  Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to her recipe, and the recipe requires 14 cups in total. So, she needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour (14 - 5 = 9).
Response:  Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to make the cake, and according to the recipe, she needs 9 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. We know that there are 11 cups of sugar required in total, and Mary has already added 4 cups, so we need to subtract 4 from 11 to get the remaining amount needed: 11 - 4 = 7 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 7 cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added some cups of flour to make the cake. If she needs 6 cups of flour in total and there are currently 4 cups of flour added (as given in the problem), then we can calculate that she still needs 2 cups of flour more. Now, if she thinks she needs 8 cups of flour more than what is required, then she actually needs 5 additional cups of flour (since 8 - 6 = 2). So, the answer is 5 cups of flour.
"Response:  Mary has already added some cups of flour to the recipe, and she needs 11 cups in total. If she adds too much flour and there are 7 cups of sugar needed, then... See more
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer:
Let's think step by step.
Mary has already added some cups of flour to the recipe, and she needs 11 cups in total. If she adds too much flour and there are 7 cups of sugar needed, then the excess flour will be unnecessary. Therefore, if Mary has added x cups of flour already, she will need (11 - x) cups of flour to complete the recipe.
So, the number of cups of flour that Mary should add is equal to (11 - x)."
Response:  Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs a total of 9 cups (as stated in the problem). So, if she adds another 6 cups, she will have a total of 15 cups of flour (9 + 6 = 15).
Response:  Mary has already added some cups of flour to make the cake. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour, then the total amount of flour needed is 10 cups (12 - 2 = 10). So, Mary would need to add 8 cups of flour (10 - 2 = 8) more to complete the recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar to her recipe. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already used (3 cups) from the total amount needed for the recipe (9 cups). So, Mary needs to add an additional 6 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary has already added 2 cups of sugar to the recipe, and the recipe requires 14 cups in total. So, she still needs to add 12 cups (14 - 2 = 12) more sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to the recipe and the recipe requires 12 cups in total. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added (11) from the total amount required (12): 12 - 11 = 1 Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of flour more to the recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added 7 cups of flour to her recipe, and according to the recipe, she needs 10 cups in total. So, she still needs to add 3 more cups of flour (10 - 7 = 3).
Response:  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs 12 cups in total. So, she still needs to add 10 more cups (12 - 2 = 10) of flour. Now, let's check how much salt is needed. The recipe requires 7 cups of salt, and since Mary has already added 3 cups (since she started with 0), she now needs to add 4 more cups (7 - 3 = 4) of salt. Therefore, the answer is 10 + 4 = 14 cups of flour and 4 cups of salt are needed.
Response:  Mary has already added 5 cups of flour to her recipe, which means she still needs 1 cup more. The recipe requires 6 cups of flour in total. Now, if she wants to add more sugar than salt (the recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt), then she will need to add an additional 1 cup of sugar. So, the final answer is: 1 + 1 = 2 cups of sugar to be added beyond what the recipe originally called for.
Response:  Mary needs to make a cake that requires flour 12 cups and sugar 13 cups. She has already added 2 cups of sugar. So, she still needs to add how many more cups of sugar?  To find out, we can subtract the amount she has already added (2 cups) from the total amount needed (13 cups): 13 - 2 = 11 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 11 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar and now she needs to add more flour. We know that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour in total. So, if Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar, then she still needs to add 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5).
Response:  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs 3 more cups of flour according to the recipe. So, in total, Mary needs 5 cups of flour (2 + 3 = 5). Since there are 18 tablespoons in a cup, we can convert the number of cups to tablespoons as follows: 5 cups x 18 tablespoons/cup = 90 tablespoons. Therefore, Mary needs 90 tablespoons of flour to complete her recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added 11 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs to add more sugar than flour. The ratio of sugar to flour in the recipe is 5:14, so if we want to find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can multiply the number of cups of flour she has already added (11) by the ratio of sugar to flour (5/14). This gives us 3.5 cups of sugar that Mary needs to add. Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, Mary needs to add 4 cups of sugar to her recipe.
"Response:  Mary has already added some flour to make the cake, so she needs x cups of flour more to use up all the flour she has. Since the recipe requires 10 cups of flour in total, and Mary has already added some, we can set up the equation:
x + 10 = 15 (where x is the number of cups of flour Mary still needs)
Now, if Mary adds too much flour, she will have excess flour left over after making the cake. So, if she adds 5 cups more than necessary, she will have y cups of extra flour:
y = 15 - (x + 10)
Now we can solve for x:
x = 5
So, Mary needs 5 cups of additional flour to complete the recipe."
Response:  Mary has already added some flour to make the cake, and she needs 13 cups of flour in total. So, if she has added x cups of flour already, then she still needs 13 - x cups of flour. We are given that Mary has not yet added all the flour she needs, so we can set up an equation: 13 - x = 12 (since she only needs 12 cups of flour left to add) Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 13: x = 12 / 13 = 9 Therefore, Mary has added 9 cups of flour to the recipe so far.
Response:  Mary has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar to her recipe. To determine how many more cups of flour she needs, we can subtract the amount she has already added from the total amount required in the recipe: 14 cups (total flour needed) - 7 cups (flour already added) = 7 cups (remaining flour needed). Therefore, Mary still needs 7 cups of flour.
Response:  Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and 12 cups of flour to her recipe. To determine how many more cups of sugar she needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added (10) from the total amount of sugar required for the recipe (11). So, Mary needs to add an additional 1 cup of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary needs 10 cups of flour to make the cake and she has already added 6 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups of flour are needed. To do this, we can divide the total amount of flour required (10 cups) by the amount of flour Mary has (6 cups). This gives us 16/6 = 2.67 cups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 cups. Therefore, Mary needs an additional 3 cups of flour to make the cake.
Response:  Mary has already added 4 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs 14 cups in total. So, she still needs to add 10 more cups (14 - 4 = 10) of flour to complete the recipe. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Mary has already added 2 cups of flour to her recipe, and she needs 3 more cups for the recipe to be complete. So, in total, Mary needs 5 cups of flour (2 + 3 = 5). Since there are 7 cups of flour in total, we can deduce that Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, leaving 5 cups remaining to add. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  Mary has already added 12 cups of flour to her recipe, which means she needs to add 4 more cups of flour (since the recipe calls for 6 cups). Now, since she has already added too much salt, she needs to subtract 3 cups of salt from the original amount called for in the recipe (which is 9 cups). So, the correct number of cups of sugar that Mary should add is: 11 - 3 = 8 cups.
Response:  Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to her recipe, and she needs to add more according to the recipe. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar in total. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar Mary still needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added (4 cups) from the total amount of sugar needed (7 cups): 7 - 4 = 3 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar to her recipe.
Response:  Mary has already added 10 cups of sugar and now needs to add more flour. We know that the recipe requires 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour in total. So, if she has already added 10 cups of sugar, then she still needs to add 2 cups (12 - 10 = 2) more cups of sugar. Similarly, since she has already added 10 cups of flour, she needs to add 4 cups (14 - 10 = 4) more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 2 cups of sugar and 4 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that in winter, 60 birds from far-off lands come to live near the mountain.  So, there are 60 - 19 = 41 birds left behind at the mountain. Now, we need to find out how many more birds flew away than those who remained. To do this, we can divide the number of birds that flew away (60) by the number of birds remaining (41). Therefore, the answer is 60 / 41 = 1.45 or approximately 1 and half times more birds flew away than remained.
Response:  We know that there are 87 bird families in the mountain area and 7 of them flew away during winter. So, the number of remaining bird families is: 87 - 7 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 bird families left in the mountain area after 7 bird families flew away during winter.
Response:  We know that in winter, 20 birds fly away from their nests near the mountain and only 14 birds remain behind. So, initially, there were 20 + 14 = 34 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 85 birds live near the mountain and their families are as follows: 23 birds go to Africa, and 37 birds go to Asia. So, we have: 85 - (23 + 37) = 19 birds left in the mountain area. Therefore, there are 19 bird families remaining near the mountain after some of them migrate to other countries.
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families living near the mountain.  Out of these, 42 birds from Africa and 31 birds from Asia have flown away. So, the number of bird families left in Africa is 8 - 42 = 34, and the number of bird families left in Asia is 8 - 31 = 5. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that flew to Africa and those that flew to Asia is 34 - 31 = 3.
Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain in winter.  Of these, 17 families (or 46 birds) migrate to Africa, and 21 families (or 58 birds) migrate to Asia. So, the total number of bird families that migrate is 17 + 21 = 38. Therefore, the difference between the number of bird families that migrate to Asia and those that migrate to Africa is 94 - 47 = 47.
Response:  We know that:  * 18 birds from the mountain are going to warm countries. * 38 birds from the mountain are going to Africa. * 80 birds from the mountain are going to Asia. Now we need to find out how many families of birds are going to fly away for winter. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of bird families flying away = Total number of birds - Number of birds staying in the mountain x Percentage of birds leaving for warm countries / Percentage of birds leaving for Africa + Percentage of birds leaving for Asia Let's plug in the values we know into the formula: Total number of birds = 18 + 38 + 80 = 126 Birds staying in the mountain = 126 - (18 x 0.5) + (38 x 0.2) + (80 x 0.1) = 94 Therefore, there are 94 bird families flying away for winter.
Response:  We know that there are already 87 bird families living near the mountain. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families living near the mountain becomes: 87 + 18 = 105 bird families. Therefore, now there are 105 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 49 birds were living in the mountain area before winter arrived. Then, 59 birds flew away to warmer places for winter. So, there are 49 - 59 = -10 birds less in the mountain area now. But then, 24 new birds came from the north pole and reached the mountain area. Therefore, the number of birds left in the mountain area is 49 + 24 = 73 birds.
Response:  We know that initially there were 41 bird families living near the mountain. Then, 27 of them flew away to a warmer country during winter. So, the number of bird families left behind is: 41 - 27 = 14.
Response:  We know that there were originally 45 bird families in the area near the mountain. Then, 86 bird families flew away for winter. So, the total number of bird families now is: 45 + 86 = 131 bird families. Therefore, the correct answer is 131.
Response:  If 35 bird families from Asia fly to Africa and 62 bird families from Africa fly to Asia, then the total number of birds that have flown between these two continents is: 35 + 62 = 97 birds. Now, let's count how many bird families are left in each continent: In Asia, there were 41 bird families initially, minus the 35 families that flew to Africa, so the remaining bird families in Asia are: 41 - 35 = 6 bird families. Similarly, in Africa, there were 62 bird families initially, plus the 35 families that flew from Asia, so the remaining bird families in Africa are: 62 + 35 = 97 bird families. Therefore, the difference in the number of bird families between Africa and Asia after the migration is: 97 - 6 = 91 bird families.
Response:  We know that 3 bird families live near the mountain and they are not going to fly south for winter. So, there will be 3 bird families left in the area. Now, we have 26 new birds from the north who came to the mountain but 2 of them flew further south due to winter. Therefore, there are 24 new birds remaining near the mountain after 2 of them flew south. Thus, there are 3 + 24 = 27 bird families left near the mountain.
Response:  Paul received 253 boxes of crayons for his birthday and lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, he had 183 boxes left (253 - 70 = 183).
Response:  Paul received 551 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift and lost or gave away 374 of them by the end of the school year, leaving him with 177 boxes. So, he received 551 - 374 = 177 boxes of crayons on his birthday.
Response:  Paul received 440 boxes of crayons for his birthday and gave away 111 to his friends. So he has 329 boxes left (440 - 111 = 329). Then, he lost 106 boxes, so he has 223 boxes left (329 - 106 = 223). Therefore, Paul has 223 boxes of crayons left.
Response:  Paul received 65 boxes of crayons as birthday gifts and gave away 213 boxes to his friends during the year. So far, he has given away more than he received. Now, let's find out how many crayons he lost or was given away. According to the question, he lost 16 crayons. Therefore, the total number of crayons that Paul had at the end of the year is: 65 - 16 = 49.
Response:  Paul received 589 boxes of crayons for his birthday and gave away 571 to his friends during one year. So he has 161 boxes left with him. Now, we need to find out how many more crayons Paul gave away than he had initially. To do this, we can subtract the number of crayons he gave away from the total number he had at first: 161 - 571 = -400. Therefore, Paul gave away fewer crayons than he had initially.
Response:  Paul received 110 boxes of crayons for his birthday and gave away 90 to his friends. So he has 21 boxes left (110 - 90 = 21). Now, we are told that he lost 412 boxes of crayons. Therefore, the number of boxes of crayons that Paul has now is: 21 - 412 = -431. So, Paul lost 431 more boxes of crayons than he gave away.
Response:  Paul gave away 563 boxes of crayons to his friends during his school year and lost 558 boxes. So he has 332 boxes left. Now, we need to find out how many boxes of crayons Paul received on his birthday. We know that the total number of boxes of crayons given away is equal to the total number of boxes of crayons received + the total number of boxes of crayons lost. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows : 563 = (x+558) where x represents the number of boxes of crayons Paul received on his birthday. Solving for x, we get x=91.So, Paul received 91 boxes of crayons on his birthday.
Response:  Paul received 52 boxes of crayons from his friends during his birthday celebration and gave away 535 boxes in total. If he has 492 remaining crayons now, then the number of crayons he gave away is equal to the number of crayons he received minus the number of crayons he has left. So, we can write an equation as follows: 535 = 52 - x, where x is the number of crayons Paul has left. Solving for x, we get: x = 492 - 535 = -83. Therefore, Paul has 83 crayons left.
Response:  Paul received 521 boxes of erasers and 66 boxes of rubbers at his birthday party. If he didn't lose or give away any of them until the end of the school year, then he had 154 erasers left (since he lost/gave away none). To find out how many erasers he initially received, we can subtract the number he had left from the total number he received: 521 - 154 = 367. So, Paul initially received 367 boxes of erasers.
Response:  Paul received 531 erasers and 38 rubbers at his birthday party. By the end of the school year, he had 391 rubbers left. So, if we subtract the number of rubbers he had at the beginning (38) from the total number of rubbers he had at the end (391), we get: 391 - 38 = 353. Therefore, Paul had 353 more erasers than rubbers at the end of the school year.
Response:  Paul received 601 pieces of erasers and 406 pieces of rubbers at his birthday party. By the end of the school year, he had 336 pieces of rubbers left, which means he used 265 pieces of rubbers (406 - 336). Since he received more erasers than rubbers, he must have used some erasers to play with or share with others. So, the number of erasers he has left is 601 - 265 = 336. Therefore, Paul has 336 more erasers than rubbers left.
Response:  Paul received 315 boxes of crayons as a birthday gift and lost or gave away 291 of them by the end of the school year. So, he has 24 boxes (315 - 291 = 24) left. Therefore, he received 24 boxes of crayons on his birthday.
Response:  Paul received 267 crayons for his birthday and lost 231 of them during the school year. That means he has 36 (267 - 231) crayons left. He gave away 308 crayons to his friends. So, the difference between the number of crayons he gave away and the number he had left is: 308 - 36 = 272. Therefore, Paul has 272 more crayons than he initially had.
Response:  Paul received 457 erasers and 320 crayons. If he didn't lose any erasers, he would have 457 - 0 = 457 erasers left at the end of the school year. Similarly, if he didn't use up all his crayons, he would have 320 - x = remaining crayons where x is the number of crayons he used during the school year. Since he had 320 crayons initially, we can say that x = 320 - 523 = -203 crayons. So, Paul lost 203 crayons during the school year. Therefore, the answer is -203.
Response:  We know that there were initially 11 customers in total. After some of them left, we are told that 3 customers remained. So, the number of customers who left is equal to the number of remaining customers minus 3 (since 3 customers remained). Therefore, the number of customers who left can be calculated as follows: Number of customers who left = Number of remaining customers - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0 Customers left. So, none of the customers left.
Response:  At first, there were 3 customers (A, B, and C). After some of them left, there were still 4 customers (D, E, F, and G). So, the number of customers who remained after some of them left is 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, there were 1 more customer than the number of customers who left.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers who left, so the number of customers remaining was 12 - 9 = 3.  Therefore, initially, there were 3 customers in the restaurant.
Response:  At first, there were 14 customers. Then, 5 customers left, so the number of customers decreased to 9 (14 - 5 = 9). Therefore, the waiter is still serving 9 customers.
Response:  At first, there were 13 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving 9 customers. Later, 4 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers is now 13 + 4 = 17. Therefore, 6 customers (9 - 4) left.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, so the number of customers decreased to 7 (12 - 15). After that, 14 new customers arrived, so the total number of customers increased to 21 (7 + 14). Therefore, the waiter is currently serving 21 customers.
Response:  Firstly, there were 3 customers initially. Then, more customers arrived and there were 8 customers in total. So, the number of new customers who arrived is 8 - 3 = 5. Therefore, the answer is 5 new customers arrived.
Response:  At first, there were 8 customers. Then, some of them left, leaving 5 customers remaining. Later, 99 new customers arrived. To find out how many customers left, we need to subtract the number of new customers from the total number of customers at the second stage. So, the answer is: Number of customers who left = Total number of customers at second stage - Number of customers at first stage = 99 - 5 = 94 customers. Therefore, 94 customers left.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Some of them left after that, so he still had 14 customers. Then, he welcomed 10 new customers later. So, now he has 24 customers in total (14 + 10).
Response:  Dan initially had $X dollars. After buying candy for $2, he was left with $X - $2 = $X - $2 dollars. Then, he spent another $3, so he was left with $X - $2 - $3 = $X - $5 dollars. Therefore, Dan initially had $X = 7 dollars.
Response:  Dan had $4 and bought candy for $2. So he has $4 - $2 = $2 left.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he bought 99 candies at $3 each. So, he spent $3 x 99 = $297. Now, he has $4 - $297 = $-293 left.
Response:  Dan has $3 and buys two candies that cost the same amount. So, he spends $3 / 2 = $1.50 on each candy. Therefore, one candy costs $1.50.
Response:  Dan has $2 and he buys 6 candies for $3 each. So, he spends a total of $ $$ = {2 x 3} = 6$. Therefore, Dan bought 6 candies.
Response:  Dan has $7 and he spends $2 to buy candy. So, he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spends another $3 to buy chocolate, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, Dan has $2 in his pocket.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he buys candy for $7 and chocolate for $6. So far, he has spent a total of $7 + $6 = $13. Therefore, he still has $4 - $13 = -$9 left.
Response:  Dan has $2 in his pocket. He buys candy for $6 and chocolate for $3. So far, he has spent a total of $6 + $3 = $9.
Response:  Dan has $5 and he buys candy for $2. So, he has $5 - $2 = $3 left. Then, he buys chocolate for $3. So, he spent all of his money ($3) to buy chocolate. Therefore, he did not have enough money to buy both candy and chocolate.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys an $8 candy bar. So he now has $4 - $8 =-$4 left. Then his friend gives him $5, so he now has $4 + $5 = $9.
Response:  Dan had $4 initially and spent $3 on candy. So he has $4 - $3 = $1 left after buying the candy. Therefore, the cost of the candy is $1.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys 10 candies for $3. So he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
Response:  Dan has $3 and he buys 2 candies for a total of $4. So, each candy costs $4 / 2 = $2.
Response:  Dan has $5 and buys chocolate for $3, so he now has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Then, he buys candy for $7, so he now has $2 - $7 = $-5 left. Therefore, Dan used more money to buy candy than he had left after buying chocolate.
Response:  Dan has $4 and buys chocolate for $7, so he spends $4 + $7 = $11. Then, he buys candy for $2, so he spends an additional $2. Therefore, in total, Dan spends $11 + $2 = $13.
Response:  Paul had 115 books initially and sold 78 of them at the garage sale. So, he has 37 books left (115 - 78 = 37). Therefore, Paul currently possesses 37 books.
Response:  Paul had some number of books initially (let's call it x). Then he sold 137 books at the garage sale and earned $137 in profit. So, after selling those books, he had (x - 137) books left. Finally, he sold another 105 books and earned $105 in profit again. Therefore, the total number of books he has now is (x - 137 + 105) = 242 books.  So, the answer is 242.
Response:  Paul had 108 books initially and sold some at the garage sale. After selling them, he gave 35 to his friends. So, now he has 73 books left (108 - 35 = 73). Now, he wants to sell more books at the garage sale. If he sells x books, then he will have x + 73 books left. Therefore, the number of books he sold at the garage sale is x.  So, the answer is x = 39.
Response:  Paul had 50 books initially and bought some at the garage sale. After that, he had 151 books left. So, if he bought x books at the garage sale, then the total number of books he has now is: 50 + x = 151 Therefore, x = 101 books.
Response:  Paul had 2 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 150 new books. Now, he has 58 books left with him. So, the number of books he sold is: 58 - 2 = 56 books.
Response:  Paul had 21 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 42 new books, which means he now has 42 - 21 = 21 books left with him. So, he sold 9 books (21 - 9 = 12) and bought 42 - 9 = 33 new books. Therefore, Paul currently has 15 books in his possession.
Response:  Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them at a garage sale. After that, he bought 38 new books, so now he has 71 + 38 = 109 books. Therefore, he bought more books than he sold. So, the difference between the number of books he had after selling some and the number of books he has now is 109 - 71 = 38 books.
Response:  Paul had initially 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 66 books and 59 pens. So, if he sold x books at the garage sale, then he has 66 - x books left. Similarly, if he sold y pens at the garage sale, then he has 59 - y pens left. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 66 = x + y (books) 59 = x - y (pens) Now, let's solve for x and y. We know that x + y = 108 (total number of books originally owned by Paul) and x - y = 55 (total number of pens originally owned by Paul). Substituting these values into the first equation, we get: 66 = 108 - x Solving for x, we get: x = 42 Books were sold at the garage sale. Now, substituting this value back into the second equation, we get: 59 = 55 - y Solving for y, we get: y = 4 Pens were also sold at the garage sale. Therefore, the answer to the question is: x = 42 books were sold at the garage sale and y = 4 pens were sold at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had initially 106 pens and 51 books. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So, the number of pens sold at the garage sale is: Number of pens sold = Total pens - Pens left after sale = 106 - 14 = 92 pens.
Response:  Paul had initially 136 books and sold some of them at the garage sale. After selling, he was left with 27 books. So, to find out how many books Paul sold, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the initial number of books he had: 136 - 27 = 109 books. Therefore, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul initially had 134 books and gave away 39 to his friends. So he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then, at the garage sale, he sold some of them and ended up with 68 books remaining. Therefore, the number of books that Paul sold at the garage sale is 68 - 95 = -27 books. Since it can't be negative, there are no books sold at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 153 books and 95 pens initially. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 13 books and 23 pens. So, the number of books sold at the garage sale is: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Remaining number of books = 153 - 13 = 140 books Therefore, Paul sold 140 books at the garage sale.
Response:  Paul had 42 pens and 143 books initially. After selling some of them at the garage sale, he was left with 113 books and 19 pens. So, the number of pens sold at the garage sale is: Number of pens sold = Total number of pens - Number of pens remaining = 19 = 42 - 113 To find out how many pens were sold, we need to subtract the number of pens remaining from the total number of pens. Therefore, the answer is 23 pens were sold at the garage sale.
"Response:  Initially, there were 10 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica cut 8 more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. So, now there are 

$$ \begin{aligned} Total \ number \ of \ roses &= 10 + 8 \\ Total \ number \ of \ roses &= 18 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, there are 18 roses in the vase."
Response:  At first, there were 16 flowers in Jessica's garden (as stated). Then, she cut 16 of them and put them into the vase. So, initially, the vase had 16 + 0 = 16 flowers. After that, she added another 16 flowers to the vase, making it have 16 + 16 = 32 flowers in total. Therefore, the initial number of flowers in the vase was 16.
Response:  Firstly, there are two roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica takes four roses from the vase and puts them aside. Now, there are six roses left in the vase (two + four = six). Next, she cuts new roses from her garden and adds them to the vase. So, after adding these new roses, there are now twenty-three roses in the vase (six + twenty = twenty-three). Therefore, Jessica cut twenty-one roses (twenty-three - two = twenty-one) from the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 15 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica took out 33 roses from the vase and put them aside. After that, she cut new roses from her garden and placed them in the vase, making it 17 roses in total. So, the difference between the number of roses she had after taking some away (33) and the number of roses she added (new ones she cut from her garden) is equal to the original number of roses minus the number she took away, which is:  15 - 33 = -18 Therefore, Jessica has more roses now than she had originally.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 21 stems of roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica took out 34 stems from the vase and put them back into her garden. So, the number of roses left in the vase is: 21 - 34 = -13. Therefore, Jessica threw away 13 more roses than she put back into the vase.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 7 bala in the vase initially. Then, Jessica cut some more balas from her garden and added them to the vase. So, the total number of balas in the vase after she added them is 7 + X, where X is the number of balas she cut from her garden. Finally, Jessica cut 20 balas from the vase, so the remaining number of balas in the vase now is 20 - X, where X is the number of balas she cut earlier. Therefore, the number of balas Jessica cut is X = 31.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 13 flowers in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some from her garden and added them to the vase, making it 21 flowers in total. Now, let's find out how many flowers are left in the garden. We can do this by subtracting the number of flowers Jessica took (which is 8) from the original number of flowers in the garden (which is 12). So, there are 4 flowers left in the garden.
Response:  Initially, there were 15 balls in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more balls and put them back in the vase. So, the total number of balls she added is equal to the number of balls she cut. Therefore, if she cut 3 balls, then the total number of balls in the vase after she finished cutting would be 15 + (3 - 3) = 15 + 0 = 15 balls. Similarly, if she cut 4 balls, then the total number of balls in the vase after she finished cutting would be 15 + (4 - 4) = 15 + (-1) = 14 balls. Since we are asked how many balls Jessica cut, we can conclude that she cut 3 balls. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  Initially, there were 21 stems of lilies in the vase (2 + 19). Then, Jessica cut 3 more stems of lilies from her garden and added them to the vase, making it 24 stems in total (21 + 3). Finally, she cut 7 more stems of lilies from the vase, leaving 16 stems remaining (24 - 7 = 16). So, Jessica cut 7 stems of lilies.
Response:  Initially, there were 5 balls and 3 lilies in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden to add to the vase. So, after she added them, there were 12 balls and 2 lilies in the vase. Therefore, the number of balls is currently 12 - 5 = 7 more than the number of lilies. Hence, the answer is 7.
Response:  Initially, there were 7 balloons and 12 lilies in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden to add to the vase. After adding these new flowers, there are now 11 balloons and 20 lilies in the vase. So, compared to the initial amount of lilies, there are 8 more lilies than balloons in the vase currently (20 - 11 = 9).
Response:  Firstly, Jessica had 3 balloons in her flower vase initially. Then she cut some balloons and added them to the vase, making the total number of balloons currently in the vase 19. So, the number of balloons that Jessica cut is equal to 16 (19 - 3).
Response:  Initially, there were 13 baskets of roses and 84 baskets of lilies in the garden. If Jessica cut some more roses from her own garden, then the number of rose baskets would decrease by x. Similarly, if she cut some more lilies from her own garden, then the number of lily baskets would decrease by y. We know that after cutting, the total number of lily baskets is 91, so we can write an equation for the number of lily baskets as follows:  Number of lily baskets = 91 - y Since Jessica cut 14 roses, the number of rose baskets decreases by 14. So, we can write an equation for the number of rose baskets as follows: Number of rose baskets = 13 - x Now we have two equations: Number of lily baskets = 91 - y Number of rose baskets = 13 - x To solve this system of linear equations, we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. Substituting the value of x = 14 into the first equation, we get: Number of lily baskets = 91 - (y - 14) Substituting the value of y = 25 into the second equation, we get: Number of rose baskets = 13 - 14 = -1 Therefore, Jessica cut 14 roses.
Response:  Initially, there were 16 bala and 3 lilies in the vase.  Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden to add to the vase. After she added them, there were 7 lilies and 13 roses in the vase. So, Jessica cut 9 lilies (since there were initially 3).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 6 balls and 20 lilies in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden to add to the vase. So, after she added them, there were 21 lilies and 22 roses in the vase. Now, we need to find out how many more roses are there than lilies. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of lilies from the total number of flowers: 22 - 20 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 more roses than lilies in the vase.
Response:  Initially, there were 9 bala and 6 lilies in the vase.  Jessica cut some more from her garden to add to the vase. So, after she added them, there were 13 lilies and 3 roses in the vase. Now, we need to find out how many more lilies than roses are in the vase now. To do this, we can simply subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers in the vase: 13 (lilies) - 3 (roses) = 10 more lilies than roses. Therefore, there are 10 more lilies than roses in the vase now.
Response:  We know that Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut some of it off. Now her hair is 13 inches long. So, we need to find out how many inches she cut off. To do this, we can divide the original length (17) by the new length (13): 17 / 13 = 5 inches. Therefore, Robin cut off 5 inches of her hair.
Response:  If Robin cut her hair from 20 inches to 10 inches, then she had 10 inches of hair before cutting. So, the length of her hair before cutting is 10 inches.
Response:  At first, Robin's hair was 16 inches long. Then she cut it to 11 inches. After that, her hair grew by 1 inch, so now it is 12 inches long. Therefore, Robin's hair length is currently 12 + 1 = 13 inches.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long and she further stretched it by 18 inches, then her new total length of hair would be: New length = Original length + Additional length = 19 inches + 18 inches = 37 inches So, the correct answer is 37 inches.
Response:  At first, Robin had long hair that was 14 inches (14 in) long. Then she cut it to 13 inches (13 in). So now her hair is 13 - 14 = -1 inch shorter than before. Therefore, her current hair length is 14 in - 1 = 13 in.
Response:  At first, Robin's hair was 14 inches long (8 + 6 = 14). Then she grew it another 8 inches (14 + 8 = 22), and finally cut it to 20 inches (22 - 8 = 14). So, Robin's hair is currently 14 inches long.
Response:  Dan has 12 bottle caps at home and found 53 more in the park, so he now has a total of 65 bottle caps (12 + 53).
Response:  Danie has 21 bottle caps initially and finds additional 30 in the park. So, he now has 51 bottle caps (21 + 30). Then, he finds another 12 bottle caps in the park, taking his total to 63 bottle caps (51 + 12). Therefore, Danie found 12 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  Даниー initially had 63 bottle caps, and he found some old ones in the park that he discarded, leaving him with 33 bottle caps now. So, Даниー initially had 63 - 51 = 12 bottle caps.
Response:  Даниー found 36 bottle caps in the park and threw away 35 old ones, leaving him with 22 new ones. So, he found more than 22 - 35 = 9 additional bottle caps compared to the number of old ones he threw away. Therefore, Dan found 22 + 9 = 31 additional bottle caps in total.
Response:  Даниー found 30 new bottle caps in the park and discarded 63 old ones, so he has 30 + 63 = 93 bottle caps now. Then, he discarded some more bottle caps, but we don't know how many exactly. So, the final number of bottle caps Danie has is 93 - X, where X is the number of bottle caps he discarded after finding the new ones in the park. Since Danie has 42 bottle caps left, we can set up the equation: 93 - X = 42. Solving for X, we get: X = 51. Therefore, Danie discarded 51 bottle caps after finding the new ones in the park.
Response:  At first, Dan found 22 bottle caps in the park. Then he collected more bottle caps and packages from other places, so he now has 28 bottle caps and 63 packages in his collection. To find out how many bottle caps Dan had initially, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he already had (22) from the total number of bottle caps he has now (28): 28 - 22 = 6. So, Dan had 6 bottle caps initially.
Response:  At first, Dan found 22 bottle caps and 30 pieces of wrapping paper in the park. So, he had 22 + 30 = 52 items initially. Then, he went back to the park and found additional 17 bottle caps and 57 pieces of wrapping paper. Therefore, his current collection has 52 (initial) + 17 = 69 items.
Response:  Dan found 30 bottle caps and 14 pieces of wrapping paper in the park. Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 pieces of wrapping paper in his collection. To find out how many more bottle caps Dan found than wrapping papers, we need to subtract the number of wrapping papers from the total number of items he found. So, the difference between the two numbers is: 30 - 14 = 16 Therefore, Dan found 16 more bottle caps than wrapping papers in the park.
"Response: 
Dan found 11 bottle caps and 28 rubber bands in the park initially. So, he had 11 + 28 = 39 items in his collection initially. 
Then, he went back to the park and found additional 68 bottle caps and 51 rubber bands. So, now he has 39 + 68 = 107 items in his collection. 
Therefore, Dan found more than twice as many rubber bands (51) as he did bottle caps (28)."
"Response: 
Dan found 71 bottle caps and 24 pieces of wrapping paper in the park. 
He already had 28 bottle caps and 16 pieces of wrapping paper in his collection before going to the park. So, he collected 71 + 28 = 99 new bottle caps and 24 + 16 = 40 new pieces of wrapping paper.  Therefore, Dan has 99 - 28 = 71 more bottle caps than he did before, and 40 - 16 = 24 more pieces of wrapping paper than he did before."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Dan found 10 bottle caps in the park and added them to his collection. So, initially, he had 27 + 10 = 37 bottle caps and 62 - 10 = 52 packaging papers.
Now, he found more bottle caps and packages in the park, which increased his collection to 37 + x = 43 bottle caps and 52 + y = 62 package papers (where x and y are unknown quantities).
Therefore, the number of package papers Dan has now is y.
So, the answer is y = 19."
Response:  Даниー initially had 66 bottle caps in his collection. Then, he lost some of them in the park. After that, he found 25 more bottle caps in the same park. So, Даниー initially had 66 + (found in the park) = 66 + 25 = 91 bottle caps. Therefore, Даниー initially had 91 bottle caps.
Response:  Before Dan found 32 bottle caps at the park, he had 25 bottle caps in his collection. So, if he finds additional bottle caps at the park, it means that his total number of bottle caps has increased. Therefore, the number of bottle caps Dan found at the park is 32 - 25 = 7 more than what he already had. Hence, the answer is 7.
Response:  Даниー initially had 60 old bottle caps in the park. He found 58 new ones and added them to his collection, so he now has 67 bottle caps in total. To find out how many bottle caps Даниー had initially, we can divide the total number of bottle caps he has now (67) by the number of new ones he found (58): 67 / 58 = 1. Therefore, Даниー initially had 1 bottle cap.
Response:  Dan threw away 6 old bottle caps in the park and found 50 new ones. So, he has 50 + 6 = 56 bottle caps now. Therefore, Daniel found more bottle caps than he threw away. The correct answer is 56.
Response:  Даниー found old things in the park and threw away 54 of them. Then he found new ones and got 48 more. Now his collection has 52 bottle caps. So, how many did he throw away? To find out, we need to subtract the number of new ones from the total number of bottle caps he had after finding both old and new ones: 52 - (54 + 48) = -6  Therefore, Даниー threw away 6 bottle caps.
Response:  At first, Dan found 82 pieces of wrapping paper and 29 bottle caps in the park. So, he had 82 + 29 = 111 items initially. Then, he collected more items from the park, which are 42 bottle caps and 61 pieces of wrapping paper. Therefore, his current collection consists of 111 (initial) + 42 (new) = 153 items.
Response:  At first, Dan found 66 rackets in the park. Then he collected 39 bottle caps. So, initially, Dan had 66 + 39 = 105 rackets and no bottle caps. Later, he found 16 more bottle caps and traded them for some of his rackets. Therefore, at the end, Dan had 105 - 16 = 89 rackets and 16 bottle caps.
Response:  Dan found 46 pieces of wrapping paper and 50 bottle caps in the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 pieces of wrapping paper. So, how many more bottle caps did Dan find than wrapping papers? We can calculate this as follows: Number of bottle caps Dan found - Number of bottle caps Dan already had = Number of extra bottle caps found 21 (found) - 5 (already had) = 16 extra bottle caps found Therefore, Dan found 16 more bottle caps than wrapping papers.
"Response: 
Dan found 65 pieces of wrapping paper and 5 bottle caps in the park. 
Now, Dan has 31 bottle caps and 9 pieces of wrapping paper in his collection. So, he found more than 34 pieces of wrapping paper (65 - 31 = 34) in the park."
"Response: 
Dan found 58 bottle caps in the park and collected them all. Then he went back to his collection and found that he already had 11 wrappers, so now he has a total of 69 items (11 wrappers + 58 bottle caps). Therefore, Dan currently has 13 more bottle caps than wrappers (69 - 56 = 13)."
Response:  Даниー found 15 bottle caps and 18 pieces of wrapping paper in the park. Now, he has 67 pieces of wrapping paper and 35 bottle caps in his collection. So, the number of wrapping papers Danie has is: 67 - 18 = 49. Therefore, Danie has 49 more wrapping papers than bottle caps.
Response:  We know that Jake has 17 marbles and Steve has 11 fewer than Jake, which means Steve has 17 - 11 = 6 marbles. Therefore, Steve has 6 marbles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer cherries than Steve. So, Jake has x cherries. Secondly, we know that Steve has more cherries than Gill. So, Steve has y + z cherries, where y is the number of cherries Gill has and z is the difference between the number of cherries Steve has and the number of cherries Gill has. Finally, we are told that Steve has 15 cherries in total, so we can set up the equation: x + (y + z) = 15. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, Jake has 9 cherries.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer cherries than Steve, and Steve has more cherries than Gill. So, if Jake has x cherries, then Steve has x + 13 cherries, and Gill has x - 18 cherries. Now, we are told that Steve has 19 cherries in total, so we can write an equation: x + (x + 13) = 19... (1) Now, let's solve for x. We can start by subtracting x from both sides of equation (1): x = 16... (2) Therefore, Gill has 16 cherries.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 9 mangoes (he has 7).  We also know that Steve has more than 8 mangoes (he has 10). So, if we subtract the number of mangoes that Steve has from the total number of mangoes, we will get the number of mangoes that Jake has. Therefore, the answer is 7 - 10 = -3.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve and Steve has more mangoes than Gill. So, if we assume that Jake has x mangoes, then Steve must have x + 11 mangoes, and Gill must have x - 12 mangoes. Now, since Steve has 4 mangoes, we can say that x = 7 (since 7 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 11). Therefore, Gill has 7 + 12 = 19 mangoes.
Response:  We know that Jake has more mangoes than Steve and fewer than Gill. So, if Jake has x mangoes, then Steve has x - 7 mangoes and Gill has x + 9 mangoes. Now we can write an equation based on this information: Jake's total number of mangoes = Steve's total number of mangoes - 7 + Gill's total number of mangoes + 9 Jake's total number of mangoes = 16 - 7 + (x + 9) Jake's total number of mangoes = 9 Solving for x, we get: Jake has 9 mangoes.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve and more than Gill. So, if Jake has x mangoes, then Steve has x + 7 mangoes and Gill has x - 8 mangoes. Now we can write an equation based on this information: 
Jake = x (since he has fewer) 
Steve = x + 7 (since he has more) 
Gill = x - 8 (since she has less) 
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can substitute each of these equations into the others and see what values they produce. For example, if we plug in x = 20 for Jake, we get: 
Jake = 20 
Steve = 27 (using x + 7 = 27) 
Gill = 13 (using x - 8 = 13) 
So, Gill has 13 mangoes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve and more mangoes than Gill. So, if Jake has x mangoes, then Steve has x - 9 mangoes and Gill has x + 18 mangoes. Now, we are told that Steve has 16 mangoes, so we can write an equation: x = 16 - 9. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, Jake has 7 mangoes more than Steve.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer than 12 mangoes (Steve has 18 - Jill has 5). So, Jake must have 6 or less mangoes. Therefore, Jake has 6 mangoes.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer than 5 mangoes than Steve. So, if Steve has x mangoes, Jake has x - 5 mangoes.  Next, we know that Steven is more than 18 mangoes than Gill. So, if Gill has y mangoes, Steven has y + 18 mangoes. Finally, we are told that Gill has 87 mangoes in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
x - 5 = y + 18... (1)  Substituting the value of y from the problem statement into equation (1), we get:  
(x - 5) = 87... (2)  Solving for x, we get:  
x = 92... (3)  Therefore, Jake has 92 mangoes more than Gill."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve. So, Steve has 16 more mangoes than Jake. Secondly, we know that Steven is greater than Jackie by 15 mangoes. Therefore, if Jackie has 12 mangoes, then he must have 3 (15 - 12) more mangoes than Jake. Finally, since Jackie has more mangoes than Jake, Jackie must be 3 + 1 = 4 more mangoes than Jake.  Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer cherries than Steve and more apples than Steve. So, if Jake has x cherries, he must have y + z apples, where y is the number of cherries Steve has and z is the difference between the number of cherries Jake has and the number of cherries Steve has. Now we can use the information given in the question to find out the values of y and z:  • Jake has 12 fewer cherries than Steve (so y = 12).  • Jake has 79 more apples than Steve (so z = 79 - 12 = 67). Therefore, Jake has x = y + z = 12 + 67 = 79 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve and more oranges than Steve. So, if Jake has x mangoes, he must have x + 3 oranges. Now we can substitute the values given in the question: Jake has 10 mangoes less than Steve, so Steve has 9 mangoes. And Jake has 3 more oranges than Steve, so Steve has 8 oranges. Therefore, Jake has 9 + 3 = 12 oranges.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve and more pears than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit collections directly, Jake has 6 less mangoes than Steve and 8 more pears than Steve. Now, let's calculate how many mangoes Steve has: According to the question, Steve has 17 mangoes. Since Jake has 6 fewer mangoes than Steve, Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 mangoes. Therefore, Steve has 17 - 6 = 11 mangoes.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer cherries than Steve and more oranges than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit collections, we can say that:  • Jake has 3 fewer cherries than Steve (since he has 9 cherries, and Steve has 12).  • Jake has 10 more oranges than Steve (since he has 14 oranges, and Steve has 15). Now, let's calculate how many more oranges Steve has than cherries:  • Number of oranges Steve has = 15 - Number of cherries Steve has = 15 - 12 = 3 Therefore, Steve has 3 more oranges than cherries.
Response:  We know that Steve has 12 mangoes and Jake has fewer than Steve but more than Gil. So, Jake has x mangoes. Since Steve has 67 more mangoes than Gil, we can say that Steve has 67 + x = 89 mangoes in total. Therefore, Jake has x = 89 - 67 = 22 mangoes.
Response:  We know that Steeven has 18 mangoes and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Jill. So, Jake has x mangoes where x is between 0 and 18 (inclusive). Also, we know that Steven has 8 more mangoes than Jill, so Steven has y mangoes where y is between 0 and 8 (inclusive). Therefore, the total number of mangoes among all three people is: x + y = 18 + 8 = 26. Since x, y are both positive integers, we can conclude that x = 4 and y = 4, which means Jake has 4 mangoes, Steven has 12 mangoes, and Jill has none.
Response:  We know that Steve has 19 mangoes and Jake has fewer than Steve but more than Jerry. So, Jake must have x mangoes where x is between 0 and 19 (inclusive). Now, we also know that Jake has 12 less mangoes than Steve, so Jake has x - 12 mangoes. Finally, we know that Jake has 72 more mangoes than Jerry, so Jake has x + 72 mangoes. Therefore, the number of mangoes Jake has is: x = 19 - 12 = 8.So, Jake has 8 mangoes.
Response:  We know that Steeven has 14 mangoes and Jake has fewer than Steven but more than Gil. So, Jake has x mangoes where x is between 8 (the minimum number of mangoes Jake could have) and 14 (Steven's total). Now we know that Gil has 3 more mangoes than Jake, so Gil has x + 3 mangoes. Since Gil cannot have more than 20 mangoes (since he cannot have more than Jake), we can conclude that Gil has exactly 17 mangoes. Therefore, the answer is 17.
Response:  We know that Jake has more oranges than Steve and less apples than Steve. So, Jake has 84 - 10 = 74 oranges and 52 apples. Now, we need to find out how many apples Steve has. According to the passage, Steve has 13 + 52 = 65 apples. Therefore, Jake has 74 oranges and 65 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has more oranges than Steve and fewer apples than Steve. So, if Jake has x oranges, he must have y apples, where x > y. Now, we are told that Steve has 8 apples and 12 oranges. Therefore, Jake must have at least 12 - 8 = 4 oranges. But we were also told that Jake has more oranges than Steve, so Jake must have more than 4 oranges. Hence, Jake has exactly 5 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jake has fewer mangoes than Steve. So, the number of mangoes Jake has is less than 24 (Steve's total). Therefore, the number of mangoes Jake has can be any number between 0 and 23. Now, let's consider the information given in the question: - Jake has 8 fewer mangoes than Steve. This means that if Steve has x mangoes, then Jake has x - 8 mangoes. - Jake has more pears than Steve. This means that if Steve has x pears, then Jake has x + 10 pears. From the above two statements, we can write an equation: x - 8 = x + 10 Substituting x with the value given in the question (x = 21), we get: 21 - 8 = 21 + 10 13 = 31 So, Jake has 31 fruits in total (including both mangoes and pears).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer cherries than Steve and more oranges than Steve. So, if we compare their fruit collections, we can say that:  • Jake has 3 fewer cherries than Steve (since he has 12 cherries, and Steve has 15).  • Jake has 4 more oranges than Steve (since he has 16 oranges, and Steve has 12). Now, let's calculate how many oranges Steve has:  • If Jake has 4 more oranges than Steve, then Steve must have x oranges where x is the difference between Jake's orange count and Steve's orange count. Therefore, Steve has 12 + 4 = 16 oranges.  Finally, to find out how many cherries Steve has, we subtract the number of oranges from his total fruit count:  • Steve has 16 + 12 = 28 fruits in total (including both cherries and oranges). So, Steve has 28 - 12 = 16 cherries.
Response:  Olivia had $78 in her purse and spent $15 at the supermarket. So, she has $78 - $15 = $63 left.
Response:  Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket and has $33 left. So, initially she had $78 + $33 = $111.
Response:  Olivia had $100 in her purse and withdrew $148 from an ATM. After shopping at the supermarket, she was left with $159. So, she spent $148 + $159 = $297.
Response:  Firstly, Olivia had $3 in her purse and she withdrew an additional $49 from the ATM. So, her total amount of money was $52 ($3 + $49). Then, after shopping at the supermarket, she spent all the money she had except for $49, which means she spent $1 ($49 - $48). Therefore, the difference between the amount she collected from the ATM and the amount she spent is $1 ($49 - $48 = $1).
Response:  Firstly, Olivia had $53 in her purse and then she collected an additional $91 from the ATM. So, now she has $144 ($53 + $91). Then, after shopping at the supermarket, she was left with $14 ($144 - $128). Therefore, Olivia spent $128 at the supermarket.
Response:  Olivia spent $49 at the showroom and has $106 left after buying the purse. She then went to the supermarket and spent some money there too. So, if she spent $X dollars at the supermarket, that means she had $106 - X dollars left after buying the purse but before going to the supermarket. Now we know that she spent $26 at the supermarket, so we can set up the equation: $$ \begin{aligned} 106 - X &= 26 \\ X &= 78 \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, Olivia spent $78 at the supermarket.
Response:  Olivia had $54 in her purse initially and spent $29 at the supermarket. To find out how much she spent, we can subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount: $54 - $29 = $25. So, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket.
Response:  Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket. If her wallet initially contained $128, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  Dave had 19 apps on his phone initially. He deleted 5 of them, leaving him with 14 apps. So, there are 14 apps left on Dave's phone after he deleted 5 of them.
Response:  Dave had 18 apps initially and after deleting some of them, he was left with 5 apps. So, initially, Dave had 18 apps.
Response:  Dave had 10 apps initially and added 11 new ones, so he has a total of 21 apps now. Later, he deleted some apps, leaving him with 4 apps remaining. Therefore, Dave deleted 17 apps (21 - 4 = 17).
"Response: 
Firstly, Deb had 21 apps initially. Then he added 89 new apps, so the total number of apps he had after that was :  21 + 89 = 110 apps. 
Now, he deleted some apps, but we are not told how many he deleted. So, let's assume he deleted half of the total apps he had (i.e., 55 apps). Therefore, the number of apps Deb had after deleting some were : 110 - 55 = 55 apps.  Finally, Deb had 24 apps left after adding and deleting some apps. Hence, the difference between the number of apps Deb added and the number of apps he had after deleting some is : 24 - 55 = -31 apps. In other words, Deb added more apps than he deleted."
"Response: 
Firstly, Deb had 15 apps initially. Then he added 71 new apps, so the total number of apps he had now is : 15 + 71 = 86 apps. 
Now, he deleted some apps, let's say he deleted 20 apps. So, the number of apps he has left after deleting some is : 86 - 20 = 66 apps.  Therefore, Deb deleted more apps than he added. The difference between the number of apps he added and the number of apps he deleted is : 71 - 20 = 51 apps."
"Response: 
We know that Dave had 16 apps and 77 files initially. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 5 apps and 23 files. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 
Number of apps = 16 - x (where x is the number of apps deleted) Number of files = 77 - y (where y is the number of files deleted) Now, we are asked how many apps Dave deleted. We can substitute the value of x from the problem statement into the first equation: Number of apps = 16 - x = 5 Therefore, Dave deleted 11 apps (i.e., 16 - 5 = 11). Similarly, we can find out how many files Dave deleted using the second equation: Number of files = 77 - y = 23 Therefore, Dave deleted 54 files (i.e., 77 - 23 = 54)."
Response:  We know that Dave had 17 apps and 21 files initially. After deleting some apps and files, 3 apps and 7 files were left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 17 - x = 3 (where x is the number of apps deleted) 21 - y = 7 (where y is the number of files deleted) Now, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously to find out how many apps and files Dave deleted. Solving the first equation for x, we get: x = 14 (since 17 - 14 = 3) Similarly, solving the second equation for y, we get: y = 14 (since 21 - 14 = 7) Therefore, Dave deleted 14 apps and 14 files.
"Response: 
At first, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files. 
After deleting some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left. 
So, the total number of apps that Dave has now is:  21 + 15 = 36 apps. 
Therefore, the answer is 36."
"Response: 
At first, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files. 
After deleting some apps and files, he had 6 apps and 15 files left.  So, the number of apps he had after deleting some is 6/19 = 0.31 (approximately). Similarly, the number of files he had after deleting some is 15/18 = 0.83 (approximately).  Therefore, Dave has more files than apps. The difference between the number of files and apps is: 0.83 - 0.31 = 0.52 (approximately). So, Dave has 52% more files than apps."
Response:  Dave had 17 apps initially and added some more later, leaving him with 18 apps in total. So, he must have added at least 1 app to his collection. Therefore, the answer is 1.
"Response: 
We know that Dave had 59 files and 15 apps initially. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 
Number of apps = 12 (given) Number of files = 30 (given) Initial number of apps = 15 (given) Initial number of files = 59 (given) Now, let's solve for the number of apps Dave deleted using the information given in the problem statement. We know that the total number of apps Dave had is equal to the number of apps he has now minus the number of apps he had initially. Therefore, we can write: Number of apps Dave deleted = Number of apps - Initial number of apps Number of apps Dave deleted = 12 - 15 Number of apps Dave deleted = -3 Since Dave had more apps than he does now, it means he deleted 3 apps. Therefore, the answer is 3."
"Response: 
We know that Dave had 24 files and 13 apps initially. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 17 apps and 21 files. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 
Files = 24 - (17 + 13) = 24 - 24 = 0 Files deleted. 
Apps = 13 Apps did not change. Therefore, no apps were deleted."
"Response: 
At first, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files. 
After deleting some apps and files, he had 5 files and 12 apps left.  So, the total number of apps he has now is 12 + 5 = 17.  Therefore, Dave has more than 17 apps but less than or equal to 24 apps in his phone."
"Response: 
At first, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files, so he had a total of 14 items (11 apps + 3 files). 
After deleting some apps and files, Dave was left with 24 files and 2 apps. So, he now has 26 items in total (24 files + 2 apps).  Therefore, Dave has 12 more files than apps (26 - 14 = 12)."
Response:  Nelly has 242 baseball cards in total. She gave Jeff 136 of them, so she has 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106).
Response:  Nelly has 301 cards in total and gives 257 (301 - 154) to Jeff. So, she had 44 cards initially.
Response:  Nelly has 528 cards initially and Jeff has 11 cards. When she gives some of her cards to Jeff, he now has 11 + 528 = 539 cards. Then, she takes back some of his cards, so he now has 539 - x = y cards, where x is the number of cards she gave him. Since there are currently 252 cards left with Nelly, we can set up the equation: y = 252 - x. Solving for x, we get: x = 207. So, Nelly gave Jeff 207 cards.
Response:  Nelly had 566 cards initially and gave some to Jeff. After that, she has 535 cards left. So, Jeff must have gotten x number of cards from Nelly. Since he already had 234 cards, his new total is x + 234 = 768 cards. Therefore, Jeff currently has 768 cards.
Response:  We know that Nel has 309 baseball cards and 356 non-baseball cards initially. She gives some of them to Jeff, but we don't know how many she gave him. So let's assume she gave him an equal number of each type (i.e., 309 baseball cards and 356 non-baseball cards). After giving them to Jeff, Nel has 415 baseball cards and 149 non-baseball cards left. Now, let's calculate the difference between the total number of baseball cards she had initially and the number she has now: Total initial baseball cards = 309 + 356 = 665 Baseball cards after giving to Jeff = 415 - So, the difference between the total initial baseball cards and the remaining baseball cards is 210 (665 - 415). Therefore, Nel has 210 more baseball cards than non-baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nel has collected 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-yen coins. She gave some of these to Jeff, who now has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-yen coins. To find out how many more ten-yen coins Nel has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of ten-yen coins Jeff has from the total number of ten-yen coins she had: 214 - 495 = -281. So, Nel has 281 more ten-yen coins than baseball cards.
Response:  Nelly has 573 baseball cards initially. She gives John 195 cards and Jeff 100 cards. Now, she has 210 cards left. So, Jeff got 100 - 195 = 45 cards from Nelly.
Response:  Nelly has 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-yen cards, for a total of 456 cards. She gives some to Jeff, who now has 55 ten-yen cards and 178 baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nelly has than ten-yen cards, we can subtract the number of ten-yen cards from the total number of cards she has: 456 - 55 = 401. So, Nelly has 401 more baseball cards than ten-yen cards.
Response:  Nelly has 239 baseball cards and 10 non-baseball cards. She gives some of them to Jeff, who now has 376 baseball cards and 111 non-baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nelly has than Jeff, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards Jeff has from the total number of baseball cards Nelly had initially. So, the difference between their numbers of baseball cards is: 239 - 376 = -137. Therefore, Nelly has 137 more baseball cards than Jeff.
Response:  Paco started with 19 cookies and ate some of them. Now there are 35 remaining cookies. To find out how many cookies Paco had initially, we can use the following equation: Number of cookies Paco had initially = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies Paco ate Initially, Paco ate 19 cookies, so... 19 = 35 - x Where x is the initial number of cookies Paco had. Solving for x, we get: x = 16 So, Paco had 16 cookies initially.
Response:  Paco had 28 cookies initially and he ate some of them. After eating, he had 7 cookies left. So, to find out how many cookies Paco ate, we can divide the number of cookies he had after eating (7) by the total number of cookies he had initially (28): 7/28 = 0.25 or 1/4. Therefore, Paco ate 1/4 of his initial 28 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies initially and he ate 2 of them, so he has 40 - 2 = 38 cookies left. Then, he bought additional 37 cookies, so now he has 38 + 37 = 75 cookies in total. Therefore, Paco has 75 cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 25 cookies initially and he ate 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. Then, he bought 3 more cookies. Now, he has 20 + 3 = 23 cookies in total. Therefore, he ate 5 cookies and then bought 3 more, so he ate 5 + 3 = 8 more cookies than he originally had.
Response:  Paco had 13 cookies initially and he ate 2 of them. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left. Then, he bought 36 more cookies. So, his total number of cookies is now 11 + 36 = 47 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 40 cookies initially and he ate 5 of them, so now he has 40 - 5 = 35 cookies left. Then, he gave away 13 of those cookies to his friends, leaving him with 35 - 13 = 22 cookies. Therefore, Paco has 22 cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 17 cookies and he ate 14 of them. So, he has 17 - 14 = 3 remaining cookies. Now, he gave away 13 of the cookies he had to his friends. So, he has 3 - 13 = -10 cookies left with him. Since he doesn't have any cookies left, the answer is -10.
Response:  Paco had 12 cookies and he ate 16 of them, so he has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies left. Then, he gave away 21 cookies to his friends, so he has -4 + 21 = 17 cookies left. Therefore, Paco gave away 17 cookies to his friends.
Response:  Paco had 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies initially. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies. So, he has 22 - 15 = 6 sweet cookies left.
Response:  Paco has 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies initially. He eats 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies. So, the number of salty cookies left with Paco is: Number of salty cookies = Initially available - Cookies eaten = 6 - 3 = 3 Therefore, the number of salty cookies left with Paco is 3.
Response:  Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. So, he has 37 - 5 = 32 sweet cookies left. And he ate 2/3 of the salty cookies, which is 11 / 3 = 3.5 salty cookies. Since we can't have half a cookie, he actually ate 4 salty cookies in total. Therefore, the difference between the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty cookies he ate is 32 - 4 = 28 sweet cookies. So, Paco ate 28 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  Paco has 8 pieces of sweet cookies and 6 pieces of salty cookies. He eats 20 pieces of sweet cookies and 34 pieces of salty cookies. To find out how many more pieces of salty cookies he ate than sweet cookies, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salty cookies he ate: 34 - 20 = 14 So, Paco ate 14 more pieces of salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  If Paco initially had 37 cookies and he ate 36 of them, then he has 1 cookie left. So, the number of cookies Paco has left is 1.
Response:  Paco had 36 cookies initially and gave away 14 to his friends. So, he has 36 - 14 = 22 cookies left. Then, he ate 10 of them, leaving him with 22 - 10 = 12 cookies. Therefore, Paco has 12 cookies left.
Response:  Paco had 41 cookies and gave away 9 to his friends. So he has 41 - 9 = 32 cookies left. He then ate 18 of those cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies Paco ate is 32 - 18 = 14 cookies.
Response:  Paco had 6 cookies and gave 30 to his friends. So he has 6 - 30 = -24 cookies left. Then, he ate 23 of them. Now, he has -24 - 23 = -47 cookies left. Therefore, Paco gave his friends 30 - 47 = -17 more cookies than he had initially.
Response:  Paco has eaten 15 of the sweet cookies and 56 of the spicy cookies, so he has (15 + 56) = 71 cookies left. Since he has already eaten 15 of the sweet cookies, there are now (71 - 15) = 56 sweet cookies left.
Response:  Paco has 26 cookies in total (including both sweet and salty). He eats 14 of the sweet cookies, leaving him with 12 (12 + 0 = 12). Then he eats 9 of the salty cookies, leaving him with 3 (12 - 9 = 3) remaining salty cookies. Therefore, Paco has 3 salty cookies left.
Response:  Paco has 39 pieces of sweet cookies and 6 pieces of salty cookies. He eats 23 pieces of sweet cookies and 32 pieces of sweet cookies. To find out how many more sweet cookies he ate than salty cookies, we can subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies he ate: (32 - 6) = 26. So, Paco ate 26 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.
Response:  Paco had 40 pieces of sweet cookies and 25 pieces of salty cookies. He ate 28 pieces of salty cookies and 15 pieces of sweet cookies. So, he ate more salty cookies than sweet cookies. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of salty cookies he had: (28 - 15) = 13. Therefore, Paco ate 13 more pieces of salty cookies than sweet cookies.
Response:  $7 - $5 = $2 So, Gwen spent $2 of the money she received for her birthday.
Response:  Gowen received $8 from her friend and spent $2, so she has $6 left. Now, we need to find out how much money Gowen received in total. We know that Gowen received $8 + ($6 - $2) = $8 + $4 = $12 dollars in total. Therefore, Gowen received $12 dollars from her friend on her birthday.
Response:  Firstly, Guwen received $2 from her mother and then she got $4 more from her father. So, in total, she had $6 ($2 + $4). Then, she spent $3 of that amount, so now she has $3 left ($6 - $3 = $3). Therefore, Guwen still has $3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Goewen received $8 from her mother and $5 from her father. So far, she has $13. Then, she spent $4 of it. Now, let's find out how much money Goewen received from her parents compared to each other. Mother gave her $8 - $4 = $4 more than what father gave her. Therefore, the difference between the amount given by mother and father is $4.
Response:  Firstly, Goewen received $3 from her mother and then she spent $4 of it. So, she has $3 - $4 = $1 left with her. Now, her father gave her an additional $6. Therefore, the total amount of money that Goewen received from both her parents is $3 + $6 = $9.
Response:  Gowen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, for a total of $12. She then spent $4, leaving her with $8. So, Gowen received more money from her mother than she did from her father. The difference is $7 - $5 = $2. Therefore, Gowen received twice as much money from her mother as she did from her father.
Response:  Gowen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, for a total of $7. Then she spent $6, leaving her with $1. So, Gowen received more money from her father than from her mother. The difference is $4 ($5 - $2).
Response:  At first, Josh had 9 beads in his collection. Then he lost some of them, so he had fewer than 9 beads left. We don't know exactly how many beads he lost, but we do know that he has 4 beads left now. So, to find out how many beads Josh lost, we can subtract the number of beads he has now (4) from the original number of beads he had (9): 9 - 4 = 5. Therefore, Josh lost 5 beads.
Response:  Josh had x beads in his collection initially. He lost 21 beads and now has 12 beads left. So, we can write an equation: x - 21 = 12 We know that x is equal to 30, so we can substitute it into the equation: 30 - 21 = 12 9 = 12 Therefore, there were originally 30 beads in Josh's collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 beads in his collection. Then he lost 11 beads, so he had 8 beads left (19 - 11 = 8). Next, he found 5 new beads, so now he has 13 beads in total (8 + 5 = 13). Therefore, Josh currently has 13 beads in his collection.
Response:  Josh had 4 balls in his collection initially. He lost 16 balls, which means he has 16 - 4 = 12 fewer balls than he started with. Then, he found 8 new balls, which means he now has 12 + 8 = 20 balls in total. So, he gained 8 balls and lost 12 balls, resulting in a net loss of 4 balls.
Response:  Josh had 7 beads in his collection initially. He lost 8 beads, so he had 7 - 8 = -1 bead less. Then, he found 10 new beads. So, his final number of beads is +10 - (-1) = 9 beads more than what he initially had. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  Josh had 21 beads in total and found 7 of them. So he has 21 - 7 = 14 beads left. Therefore, Josh currently possesses 14 beads.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 20 beads in his collection. Then Jack gave him 2 beads. So now, Josh has 20 + 2 = 22 beads in his collection. Therefore, Josh currently possesses 22 beads.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 22 beads in his collection. Then Jack gave him 20 more beads. So, now Josh has 22 + 20 = 42 beads in total.
Response:  Josh had 19 beads initially and lost 11 of them. So he has 8 beads left (19 - 11 = 8).
"Response: 
Josh had 22 beads in his collection initially. 
He found 13 of them. So he now has 22 - 13 = 9 beads left. 
But then he lost 5 beads. So he now has 9 - 5 = 4 beads left. Therefore, Josh currently has 4 beads in his collection."
Response:  Josh had 15 beads in his collection initially. He found 9 of them, so he has 6 (15 - 9) beads left. However, he lost 23 beads, which means he now has -7 (23 - 6) beads left. Since he has more beads that he found than he lost, the number of beads he lost is equal to the difference between the total number of beads he had and the number he found. Therefore, the answer is -7.
Response:  Firstly, Josh had 3 beads in his collection. Then he found 6 more beads but lost 5 of them. So, he now has 3 + 6 - 5 = 8 beads in total. Therefore, there are 8 more beads than what he initially had.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to strawberry picking together. The total weight of their strawberries is 4 pounds (or 1800 grams). Marco's strawberries weigh 19 pounds (or 860 grams) more than his father's strawberries. So, the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his father's strawberries is: 19 pounds - 4 pounds = 15 pounds (or 680 grams). Therefore, Marco's strawberries are 15 pounds heavier than his father's strawberries.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to strawberry picking together. The total weight of their strawberries is 35 pounds (or 15.9 kg). Marco's share of the strawberries weighs 13 pounds (or 6.02 kg). So, how much heavier was his father's share than Marco's? To find out, let's subtract Marco's weight from the total weight: 35 pounds - 13 pounds = 22 pounds (or 10.04 kg) Therefore, his father's share of the strawberries was 22 pounds heavier than Marco's.
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father went to strawberry picking together. The total weight of their strawberries is 20 pounds (20 lb). Marcos' father's strawberries weigh 17 pounds (17 lb). So, how much do Marcos' strawberries weigh? To find out, we can use the following equation: Total weight = Father's weight + Son's weight Marcos' weight = Total weight - Father's weight Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Marcos' weight = 20 lb - 17 lb = 3 lb Therefore, Marcos' strawberries weigh 3 pounds (3 lb).
Response:  Mariko and her father went to strawberry picking together. Mariko picked 8 pounds of strawberries, while her father picked 32 pounds. How many pounds did they have in total? To find out, we need to add the weight of Mariko's strawberries to the weight of her father's strawberries. So, the total weight of their strawberries is: 8 + 32 = 40 pounds. Therefore, the answer is 40 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco and his father went to pick strawberries together and collected 24 pounds of strawberries in total. Then, on their way back home, Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries. So, now Marco has 3 pounds of strawberries left.  Next, we need to find out how much weight Marco's original strawberries were. Since he had 9 pounds initially, each pound of strawberries must have been worth x amount of dollars. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3 = x/9 where x is the value of one pound of strawberries Initially, we don't know what the value of one pound of strawberries was, but we do know that it was between $1 and $3 since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries which means he had 9 times more strawberries initially. Solving for x, we get: x = $3 per pound Now, let's substitute this value into our previous equation to find out how many pounds of strawberries Marco originally had: 3 = $3 x 9 / 3 = 9 pounds So, Marco originally had 9 pounds of strawberries. As for his father's strawberries, we know they were 24 pounds in total, so each pound of strawberries must have been worth $x / 24 where x is the value of one pound of strawberries. Substituting the values we just found, we get: $3 = $x / 24 $x = $12 per pound Finally, we can calculate the weight of Marco's father's strawberries: 24 pounds x $12 per pound = $288 So, Marco's father had 288 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  Firstly, Marcos and his father went to pick strawberries together and collected 36 pounds of strawberries. On their way back home, Marcos' father lost 8 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, Marcos now has 12 pounds of strawberries.  Now, we need to find out how much weight Marcos' father's remaining strawberries have. Since he had 8 pounds initially, and he lost 8 pounds, then he currently has 0 pounds of strawberries. So, the answer is 0 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, Marco and his father went to pick strawberries together and collected 22 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Marco's father found additional 30 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, the total weight of strawberries that Marco had is now 36 pounds. Now, we need to find out how much weight did Marco's father gain in terms of strawberries. We are given that Marco's father found additional 30 pounds of strawberries, so the total weight of strawberries he has now is: 30 + 22 = 52 pounds. So, the weight of strawberries that Marco's father gained is 52 - 22 = 30 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marcos and his father went to strawberry picking together. Marcos picked 15 pounds of strawberries, and their total weight was 37 pounds. So, we can deduce that Marcos' father picked 22 pounds of strawberries (37 - 15 = 22).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to strawberry picking together.  Marco picked 30 pounds of strawberries, while their total weight was 17 pounds. So, we can deduce that Marco's strawberries were heavier than his father's by how much? To find out, let's divide the difference in weight between Marco's strawberries and his father's strawberries by the total weight of their combined strawberries. This will give us the ratio of the weight of Marco's strawberries compared to his father's strawberries. For example, if Marco's strawberries were twice as heavy as his father's, the ratio would be 2:1. Now, let's apply this logic to our problem:  Ratio = (Marco's weight - Father's weight) / Total weight of strawberries  Using the information given in the question, we have: Ratio = (30 - 17) / 17  = 13  Therefore, Marco's strawberries were 13 pounds heavier than his father's!
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to strawberry picking together.  Marco picked 10 pounds of strawberries, and their total weight was 26 pounds. So, we can calculate the weight of Marco's father's strawberries as follows: Weight of Marco's father's strawberries = Total weight - Weight of Marco's strawberries = 26 pounds - 10 pounds = 16 pounds Therefore, the weight of Marco's father's strawberries is 16 pounds more than Marco's strawberries.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father went to strawberry picking together.  Marco's father's strawberries weighed 11 pounds. When they combined their strawberries, it totaled 30 pounds. So, how much did Marco's strawberries weigh? To find out, let's divide the total weight of their strawberries (30 pounds) by two since Marco and his father had equal amounts of strawberries. Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds (30 pounds / 2 = 15 pounds).
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, more children got on the bus at the stop, so the total number of children on the bus increased to 3 (the original 2 + the new child). Next, even more children got on the bus at another stop, increasing the total number of children to 6 (the original 3 + the new child). Finally, there were 10 children in total on the bus. Therefore, compared to when the bus first left the station, there are 4 more children on the bus now (10 - 6 = 4). So, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, there were 26 children in the bus initially. Then, additional 38 children boarded the bus at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus now is:  26 + 38 = 64  Therefore, there are 64 children in the bus currently.
Response:  Firstly, there were two children at the bus stop. Then, 40 more children got on the bus after that. Therefore, the total number of children who got off the bus at the bus stop is 2 + 40 = 42. So, there were 42 children in total who got off the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop. So, the number of children left in the bus is 43 - (number of children who got off). Therefore, we need to find out how many children got off the bus. We are given that 21 children remained in the bus after they got off, so the number of children who got off is 21. Hence, the number of children who got off the bus is 21.
Response:  Initially, there were 41 children in the bus.  At the bus stop, some of them got off, so the number of children left in the bus was 18. To find out how many more children were in the bus than at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the initial number of children. So, the answer is:  41 - 18 = 23 More children were in the bus than at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 11 children still on the bus. Later, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number of children to 16. So, the number of children who got off at the bus stop is 10 - 11 = -1. Therefore, the number of children who boarded the bus is 16 - 11 = 5.
Response:  At first, there were 5 children in the bus. Then, 63 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 68 children still on the bus (including the initial 5). Finally, some more children boarded the bus, bringing the total number of children on the bus to 14. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who remained on the bus is 68 - 14 = 54. So, there were 54 additional children who boarded the bus after getting off at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 36 children on the bus. Then, 68 children got off at the bus stop, leaving 36 + 68 = 104 children on the bus. Finally, some more children boarded the bus, resulting in 104 - 12 = 92 children left on the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 68 - 36 = 32 more than the number of children who originally got on the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 40 children got on the bus and some of them got off, so the number of children left in the bus is 22 - X, where X is the number of children who got off. Since there are only 2 children left in the bus, we can set up the equation: 22 - X = 2. Solving for X, we get: X = 20. So, 20 children got off the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 28 children in the bus. Then, 82 children got on the bus and some of them got off. So, the total number of children left in the bus is 30. Now, let's calculate the difference between the initial number of children (28) and the final number of children (30). This gives us the number of children who got on the bus: 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, there were 2 more children who got on the bus than those who got off.
Response:  At first, there were 23 children in the bus. Then, 24 children got on the bus at the stop, so the total number of children on the bus became 23 + 24 = 47. Now, some children got off the bus, leaving 8 children behind. Therefore, the difference between the number of children who got on and off the bus is 47 - 8 = 39 children.
Response:  If Baker made 133 cakes and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining cakes (133 - 51 = 82). So, the number of cakes that Baker made more than he sold is 82.
Response:  If Baker made 54 cakes and sold some of them, then he has X cakes left. Since he still has 13 cakes left, we can write an equation: X + 13 = 54. Now solve for X: X = 41. So, Baker sold 13 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 145 cakes and sold them all. So, he has 72 cakes left with him. To find out how many cakes the baker made initially, we can use the following equation: Number of cakes made = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes sold = 72 - 145 = -73 cakes. Therefore, the baker did not make any cakes.
Response:  If Baker has 155 cakes and his friend buys 140 of them, then Baker has 15 - 14 = 1 cake left. So, Baker still has 1 cake.
Response:  The baker made 121 cakes and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 (121 - 105) cakes left. Then, he bought 170 new cakes, so now he has 34 (16 + 170) cakes in total. Therefore, the baker currently has 34 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 13 cakes and sold 91 of them. So, he has 91 - 13 = 78 remaining cakes. Then, he bought 154 new cakes. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes he bought and the number of cakes he had is:  154 - 78 = 76 cakes. So, the baker bought 76 more cakes than he had initially.
Response:  The baker made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. So, he has 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new cakes. So, now he has 92 + 31 = 123 cakes in total. Therefore, the number of cakes the baker had after buying is 123 - 78 = 45 more than the number of cakes he sold. In other words, the baker sold 78 cakes and bought 45 new ones, so the difference between the two numbers is 78 - 45 = 33.
Response:  The baker made 110 cakes and sold 75 of them. Then he made another 76 cakes. So far, the baker has 110 - 75 = 35 cakes left. Therefore, the baker currently has 35 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 144 cakes and sold 71 of them. Then, he made 111 more cakes. So, the total number of cakes the baker made is: 144 + 111 = 255 cakes. Therefore, the baker made 109 more cakes than the ones he sold (255 - 71 = 109).
Response:  Baaker has 149 cakes and 91 pies. If he sells 10 cakes and 90 pies, then he will have 149 - 10 = 139 cakes left. So, Baker still has 139 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 7 cakes and 148 pastries. If he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries, then he has remaining pastries equal to: (148 - 103) = 45 pastries. Therefore, the baker still has 45 pastries left.
Response:  The baker made 126 cakes and sold 115 of them. So he has 11 left over. Now, let's look at the pastries. He made 48 pastries and sold 81 of them. So he has 39 left over. Therefore, the baker made more cakes than pastries. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made: 39 - 81 = -42. So the baker made 42 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  The baker made 19 cakes and 131 pies. If he sold each cake for $5 and each pie for $4, then his total revenue from cakes would be $95 (19 x $5) and his total revenue from pies would be $528 ($131 x $4). So, if he sold more pies than cakes, he would have earned more money from pies. Therefore, the number of pies the baker made is greater than the number of cakes he made.
Response:  The baker made 157 cakes and sold 158 of them. He also made 169 pies and sold 147 of them. So, the number of cakes the baker sold is equal to the number of pies he didn't sell. Therefore, the difference between the number of cakes sold (158) and the number of pies sold (147) is equal to the number of cakes the baker did not sell. In other words, the baker sold 11 more cakes than pies. So, the answer is 11.
Response:  The baker made 54 cakes and sold them for $70 each, so he earned $3780 from selling cakes. He also made 143 pastries and sold them for $90 each, so he earned $12,570 from selling pastries. Therefore, the baker earned a total of $16,340 from both cakes and pastries. So, the number of pastries the baker sold is: $$ \therefore Number\ of\ pastries = Total\ earnings - Total\ earnings\ from\ cakes $$ $16,340 - $3780 = 12,560 $ $12,560$ Pastries$$ Therefore, the baker sold 12,560 pastries more than he did cakes.
Response:  If Baker made 44 cakes and sold them all, he would have 0 cakes left. So, if he had started with 48 cakes to begin with, he would still have 48 cakes left after selling 44 of them. Therefore, the answer is 48.
Response:  If Baker made 8 cakes and sold them all, then he must have had some left over to sell. So, let's assume that he made x cakes initially. Since he sold 8 cakes, we can say that x - 8 = 40 (since he started with 40 cakes). Now, we need to find out how many cakes Baker made initially. Solving for x, we get: x = 48. Therefore, Baker made 48 cakes initially.
Response:  At first, Baker made 169 cakes and gave 137 of them to his friend. So, he still has 32 cakes left with him.
Response:  Baaker made 173 cakes and sold 86 of them. So he has 87 cakes left (173 - 86 = 87). Then, he bought 103 new cakes. Therefore, the total number of cakes Baker has now is 87 + 103 = 190 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 99 cakes and sold 89 of them, so he has 10 extra cakes left (99 - 89 = 10). Now, the baker bought 167 new cakes, which means he has 78 more cakes than he already had (167 - 10 = 78). Therefore, the baker bought 78 more cakes than he sold.
Response:  The baker made 8 cakes and sold them all. Then he bought 139 new cakes and sold 145 of them. So, the number of cakes the baker sold is: Sold = Bought - Made = 139 - 8 = 131 To find out how many more cakes the baker sold than he bought, we subtract the number of cakes he bought from the number of cakes he sold: Excess = Sold - Buy = 131 - 139 = -6 Therefore, the baker sold 6 fewer cakes than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 62 cakes initially and then made additional 149 cakes. He sold 144 of them. So, the number of cakes the baker has left is: Initially, he had 62 cakes + (Additional cakes made - Cakes sold) = 62 + (-144) = 86 cakes. Therefore, the baker has 86 cakes left.
Response:  The baker made 81 cakes initially and then made additional 92 cakes. So, in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 cakes. Out of these, he sold 46 cakes, which means he has 173 - 46 = 127 cakes left with him. Therefore, the baker made more cakes than the ones he sold.
Response:  Baaker made 61 pies and 167 cakes. He sold 108 cakes and 44 pies. So, he has (61 + 167) - (108 + 44) = 253 pieces of baked goods left. Therefore, Baker has 253 cakes and 253 pies left.
Response:  The baker made 56 pieces of bread and 124 pieces of cake. He sold 104 pieces of cake and kept 29 pieces of bread for himself. So, the number of bread that the baker has left is: 29 - 29 = 0 pieces. Therefore, the baker has no bread left.
Response:  The baker made 52 pies and 84 cakes. So, in total, he made 52 + 84 = 136 items. He sold 102 cakes and 94 pieces of pie. Therefore, the number of extra cakes the baker made is: 102 - 94 = 8.
Response:  Baaker made 134 paystries and 11 cakes. He sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries. So, we need to find out how many more pastries he made than cakes he sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of cakes he sold from the total number of pastries he made: 134 - 140 = -6. Therefore, Baker made 6 more paystries than cakes he sold.
Response:  The baker made 14 cakes and 153 pastries. If he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes, then... (2 × 8) = 16 pastries were sold. So, the number of cakes sold is 97 - 16 = 81. Therefore, the baker sold 81 more cakes than pastries.
Response:  The baker made 43 cakes and sold them for 154 pieces. Similarly, he made 114 pies and sold them for 78 pieces. So, we can calculate the difference between the number of pies sold and the number of cakes sold as follows:  Difference = Number of pies sold - Number of cakes sold = 114 - 43 = 71 Therefore, the baker sold 71 more pies than cakes.
Response:  Kel...
Response:  If Kerry has 106 Nintendo games and donates 64 of them, then he will have 32 games left.
Response:  Kel...
Response:  Kerry has 20 Nintendo games and wants to reduce them to 12. To do this, she needs to give away 8 Nintendo games (20 - 12 = 8). So, the answer is 8.
Response:  Kel...
Response:  Kerry has 80 Nintendo games and finds an additional 31 Nintendo games. To determine how many games she needs to donate, we need to subtract the number of games she already has from the total number of games found. So, the answer is: 80 - 31 = 49 games that Kerry needs to donate.
Response:  Randi has built a tower using 52 blocks. So he had 52 - 38 = 14 blocks left after building the tower. Therefore, Randi initially had 14 blocks.
Response:  Randi has 97 blocks and he is using some of them to build a tower. After building the tower, he has 72 blocks left. To find out how many blocks Randi used to build the tower, we can divide the number of blocks he had after building the tower (72) by the total number of blocks he had (97). So, Randi used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  Randi has 79 blocks and he uses 14 of them to build a tower. So, he has 65 blocks left (79 - 14 = 65). Then, he uses 11 blocks to build a house. So, he has 54 blocks left (65 - 11 = 54). Therefore, there are 54 blocks remaining.
Response:  Randi has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower. So, he has 31 blocks left (58 - 27 = 31). Then, he uses 53 blocks to build a house. So, now he has 18 blocks left (31 - 53 = 18). Therefore, Randi used a total of 18 + 27 = 45 blocks.
Response:  Randi has 37 blocks and he uses 33 of them to build a tower. So, he has 4 blocks left over from building the tower. Now, he uses 13 of those blocks to build a house. Therefore, he used 4 + 13 = 17 blocks more than he used for building the tower.
Response:  Randi has 86 blocks and he uses 79 of them to build a tower. This means that he has 8 - 79 = 17 blocks left over after building the tower. Then, he uses 82 of these remaining blocks to build a house. So, in total, Randi used 79 + 82 = 161 blocks to build both the tower and the house. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks he used for each structure is:  161 - 79 = 82 blocks.
Response:  If Randi has 36 blocks to build a tower, and he has 59 total blocks, then we can calculate how many blocks are left over as follows: Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks used for the tower = 59 - 36 = 23 blocks So there are 23 blocks left over.
Response:  Randi has 95 blocks and he uses 20 of them to build his house. So, he has 75 blocks left (95 - 20 = 75). Then, he uses 50 of those remaining blocks to build his tower. So, now he has 25 blocks left (75 - 50 = 25). Therefore, Randi used 35 more blocks than he had originally (50 - 25 = 35).
Response:  Randi has 90 blocks and he uses 89 of them to build his house. So, he has 1 block left over after building the house. Then, he uses 63 blocks to build a tower. Since he already used 89 blocks for his house, he can only use 74 blocks (63 - 89 = 74) to build the tower. Therefore, Randi uses more than 90 blocks to build both the house and the tower. The difference is 74 - 90 = -26 blocks.
Response:  We know that there are 20 books in total in the series. If the person has already read 5 books, then we can deduce that they have not read any of the remaining 15 books. So, the number of books the person has read is 5.
"Response:  We know that the person has read 13 books from the series and still needs to read 8 more. So, in total, there are 21 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series."
"Response:  If we have read 12 books from the series ""Crazy Series School"" and watched 56 movies, then we still need to read 9 books (22 - 12 = 9)."
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series. If we read all 19 books and watch all 7 movies, then we have seen all of them. So, the remaining number of movies to be watched is: 7 - 7 = 0 movies. Therefore, no more movies need to be watched.
"Response:  If we have 16 books and 14 movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series, that means there are 16 + 14 = 30 items in total.  Now, if we read 19 books and watch 13 movies, it means we have read 19 - 13 = 6 more books than the number of movies we watched. Therefore, there are 6 more books in the series than movies. So, the answer is 6."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 movies in the ""Crazy Series School"" series. If we read all 19 books, we have read a total of 19 x 8 = 152 books. Similarly, if we watch all 61 movies, we have watched a total of 61 x 10 = 610 movies. So, the difference between the number of books and movies is: 610 - 152 = 458 movies. Therefore, there are 458 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 movies in the series. If we read 13 books, then we have read all of them plus one extra book. Therefore, the number of books we read is 13 - 1 = 12. Similarly, if we watch 12 movies, then we have watched all of them plus one extra movie. So, the number of movies we watched is 12 - 1 = 11. Thus, the difference between the number of books and movies we read/watched is 12 - 11 = 1.
Response:  If we read 7 books from the series and watch 21 movies, then we have watched a total of 28 movies (21 + 7). Now, let's compare this to the number of movies we would have watched if we had only read the books. Since there are 11 different books in the series, each book is watched once for every 7 books read. Therefore, if we read 7 books, we will have watched 7 x 11 = 77 movies. So, in this case, we have watched more movies than books.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series that the person has read. If there are a total of 14 different books in the series, then we can conclude that the person still needs to read 6 more books (14 - 8 = 6)."
"Response:  We know that there are 62 types of movies in the ""Crazy Series"" series and 19 types of books. The person has already read 4 books and watched 34 movies. To find out how many more books they need to read, we can subtract the number of books they have already read from the total number of books available: 62 - 4 = 58 remaining books. Therefore, the person still needs to read 58 books."
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series. If we have read 7 books, then we still need to watch 4 movies. Therefore, the answer is 4 movies.
"Response:  According to the question, there are 14 types of movies in the ""Crazy Series"" series and 15 types of books. If we read 11 books, that means we have not read all the books available (11/15). Similarly, if we watched 40 movies, it means we have not watched all the movies available (40/14). So, the difference between the number of books read and the number of movies watched is: 11 - 40 = -29. Therefore, the number of books more than the number of movies is 29."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 17 types of movies and 11 types of books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series. So, the total number of items is 17 + 11 = 28. Now, we know that the person has read 13 books and watched 63 movies. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies and books is: 63 - 13 = 50 movies. So, there are 50 more movies than books in the ""Crazy Series School"" series."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 movies in the series. If we read 14 movies and 19 books, then we have read a total of: Books = 19 + 10 = 29 items from the series. Since we watched more books than movies, we can conclude that we read more books than movies. Therefore, the answer is: More than 14 (books - movies) = More than 29 - 14 = 15
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series. If we read 19 movies, it means we have watched 19 x 5 = 95 movies. Since we also read 16 books, it means we have read 16 + 95 = 111 books. Therefore, we can conclude that we have read more movies than books. So, the answer is 95 - 111 = -16 movies.
Response:  Deib has obtained 7 tickets in the arcade and used some of them to buy toys. If he still has 2 tickets left, then he must have used ______ tickets to buy toys. (Note: The blank represents the number of tickets used for buying toys.)
Response:  If Deb has already obtained 12 tickets and he still has 14 left, that means he has a total of 26 tickets (12 + 14 = 26). So, Deb obtained 26 tickets at the arcade.
Response:  Deib has obtained 18 tickets in total. He used 5 of them as toys and 11 of them as clothes. So, he has 18 - (5 + 11) = 12 tickets left.
Response:  Deib got 19 tickets in total. He used 12 of them to buy toys and 7 of them to buy clothes. So he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 9 tickets left. Therefore, Deib used more tickets to buy clothes than he did to buy toys.
Response:  Deib has obtained 13 tickets in the arcade. He used 8 of them to buy toys and the remaining 5 (13 - 8 = 5) to buy clothes. So, he used more tickets to buy clothes than he did for toys. Therefore, the difference between the number of tickets he used for clothes and toys is 5.
"Response: 
Deib initially had 14 tickets and lost 2 of them. So he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left.  If he uses 10 of those tickets to buy toys, then he is left with 12 - 10 = 2 tickets."
Response:  Heather had 14 trees in her garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 9 of them died. So, the number of trees that survived is 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 more trees that died than survived.
Response:  Heather had 13 trees in her garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 6 of them died. So, the number of surviving trees is 13 - 6 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 more trees than those that died.
Response:  Heather had 20 trees in her garden before the typhoon. After the typhoon, 4 trees remained. So, we can conclude that 16 trees died (20 - 4 = 16).
Response:  Heather had 17 trees in her garden before the typhoon (5 + 12 = 17). After the typhoon, 5 of them died, leaving 12 alive. So, Heather has 12 trees left in her garden.
Response:  Initially, Heather had 9 trees in her garden. After the typhoon, 4 of them died, leaving her with 5 alive ones. Then she planted additional 5 new trees, so now she has 10 trees in total (including both old and new ones). Therefore, Heather currently possesses 10 trees.
Response:  At first, Hayley had 12 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon, 2 of them died, leaving 10 alive. So, the number of remaining trees is 10.
Response:  If there were initially 13 trees and 3 of them survived, then the number of trees that died is 10 (13 - 3). Now, we are asked how many more trees died than survived. So, the difference between the total number of trees that died (10) and the number of trees that survived (3) is 7 (10 - 3). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  Initially, there were 11 trees growing in Heather's backyard. After the typhoon, 2 of them died, leaving 9 alive. So, if Heather had initially grown 11 trees and 2 of them died after the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is 9.
Response:  If he harvests 66 baskets of oranges in one day and each basket contains 28 oranges, then we can calculate the total number of oranges as follows: Number of oranges = Total number of baskets x Number of oranges per basket So, the total number of oranges he harvested in one day is: Number of oranges = 66 x 28 = 1904 oranges. Therefore, he harvested 1904 oranges in one day.
Response:  If he harvests 8 baskets per day, then in one day he will have harvested 8 x 24 = 192 oranges. So it will take him 192 / 8 = 24 days to harvest all 24 baskets of oranges.
Response:  If he went to see the orange harvest after that and knew that it would last for 4 days, then the total number of oranges collected is 56. To find out how many oranges are collected per day, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of days: 56 / 4 = 14. So, approximately 14 oranges are collected per day.
"Response:  After 49 days of harvesting oranges, if each day he collected 38 baskets and each basket contains 42 oranges, then in total he collected:

$$ \text {Total number of oranges} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of baskets per day} \times \text{Number of oranges per basket} $$

= $49$ days $\times $ $38$ baskets/day $\times $ $42$ oranges/basket

= $1760$ oranges

So, after $49$ days of harvesting oranges, he would have $1760$ oranges."
Response:  If he harvests oranges for 87 days and each day he collects 66 baskets of oranges, then in total, he will have collected $ $\boxed{87 \times 66 = 5902}$$ baskets of oranges. Since each basket contains $25$ oranges, then the total number of oranges he has is $ $\boxed{5902 \times 25 = 147,630}$$ oranges. $$ Therefore, he has $\boxed{147630}$ oranges after 87 days of orange harvesting.
Response:  If he harvests 8 bags per day and each bag contains 35 oranges, then we can calculate how many oranges he collects in one day as follows: Number of oranges collected = Total number of oranges / Number of bags per day So, if he collects 8 bags per day, then the total number of oranges is: 35 x 8 = 280 oranges per day Therefore, he collects 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If he harvests 16 baskets per day and each basket contains 57 oranges, then in one day he will have collected 904 oranges (16 x 57 = 904). To collect 80 baskets of oranges, it will take him 80 / 904 = 8.8 days.
Response:  If he harvests 35 baskets of oranges and each basket contains 12 oranges, then we have: Number of oranges = Total number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket So, if he harvests 35 baskets, then the total number of oranges is: Number of oranges = 35 x 12 = 420 oranges. Therefore, there are 420 oranges in total.
Response:  If he harvested oranges for 51 days and threw away 71 baskets per day, then he must have collected 51 x 71 = 3621 baskets of oranges during that period. Since he threw away 71 baskets per day, he must have had 3621 - 71 = 3550 baskets of oranges left after 51 days.
Response:  If he harvested 76 baskets of oranges in one day and threw away 64 baskets, then he had 12 baskets of oranges left (76 - 64 = 12). Since each basket contains 50 oranges, he had 12 x 50 = 600 oranges left after throwing away the excess. So, he harvested 600 oranges per day.
Response:  On day 1, he harvested 28 bags of ripe oranges and 52 bags of unripe oranges. So, in total, he had 28 + 52 = 80 bags of oranges on Day 1. Now, let's assume that he continues to harvest oranges at this rate every day for 26 days. Therefore, on the 26th day, he will have collected 80 x 26 = 2040 bags of oranges.
Response:  After harvesting oranges for 25 days, they collected 82 boxes of fully ripe oranges and 61 boxes of unripe oranges in total. So, if they continue to collect oranges at this rate, how many boxes of fully ripe oranges will they have after 25 days? We can calculate it as follows: Number of boxes of fully ripe oranges = Total number of fully ripe oranges / Rate of collection per day Fully ripe oranges collected per day = Total number of fully ripe oranges / Number of days taken to collect them (25 days) = 82 boxes / 25 days = 3.3 boxes per day Now, let's find out how many boxes of fully ripe oranges they will have after 25 days: Number of boxes of fully ripe oranges after 25 days = Daily collection x Number of days taken to collect them = 3.3 boxes/day x 25 days = 79.5 boxes Therefore, after 25 days, they will have 79.5 boxes of fully ripe oranges.
Response:  If they harvested 31 bags of ripe oranges and 24 bags of unripe oranges per day for 45 days, then the total number of unripe oranges collected would be: Total unripe oranges = Number of days x Number of bags of unripe oranges/day = 45 days x 24 bags/day = 1080 bags So, after 45 days, there would be 1080 bags of unripe oranges.
Response:  If he harvested 44 bags of ripe oranges and 25 bags of unripe oranges in one day, then we can calculate the ratio of ripe to unripe oranges as follows: Riperange = Number of ripe oranges / Total number of oranges = 44 / (44 + 25) = 3/5 So, there are three fifths (or 60%) more ripe oranges than unripe ones.
Response:  If he harvested 5 bags of fully ripe oranges and 74 bags of unripe ones in one day, then we can calculate the number of bags of unripe oranges per bag of ripe ones as follows: Unripe oranges / Ripe oranges = 74/5 = 14.8 (round up to 15) So, for every bag of ripe oranges, there are 15 bags of unripe oranges.
Response:  If they harvested 54 baskets of oranges in total and they harvest 18 baskets per day, then it took them how many days to collect all those oranges?  We can solve this problem using basic arithmetic.  So, if they collected 54 baskets of oranges in total, and they collected 18 baskets per day, then it took them 3 days to collect all those oranges. Therefore, the answer is (3).
Response:  If he harvested oranges for 14 days and collected a total of 56 bags, then we can calculate the number of bags per day as follows: Number of bags per day = Total number of bags / Number of days = 56 bags / 14 days = 4 bags per day So, he collected 4 bags of oranges per day.
Response:  If he harvests 25 unripe oranges per day and 5 ripe oranges per day for 73 days, then the total number of unripe oranges he has harvested is: 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe oranges. The total number of ripe oranges he has harvested is: 5 x 73 = 365 ripe oranges. So, at the end of 73 days, he would have 1825 + 365 = 2190 oranges in total.
Response:  After 6 days of harvesting, the number of unripe oranges that will become ripe is given by the equation: Number of ripe oranges = Total number of oranges x Percentage of oranges that ripen per day Number of unripe oranges at the start of the 6th day = 65 (from the previous day) x (1 - 0.7) = 39.5 So, after 6 days, there will be approximately 39.5 ripe oranges out of the original 104 unripe oranges.
Response:  If he harvested 41 bags of unripe oranges per day and 86 bags of ripe oranges per day, we can calculate the ratio of ripe to unripe oranges as follows: Ratio = Number of ripe oranges / Number of unripe oranges = 86 / 41 = 2.07 (approximately) So, approximately 2.07 times more ripe oranges were harvested than unripe oranges per day.
Response:  If he harvested 71 bags of unripe oranges and 60 bags of ripe oranges in one day, then we can say that the number of bags of unripe oranges is greater than the number of bags of ripe oranges. So, the difference between these two numbers is equal to the number of bags of unripe oranges minus the number of bags of ripe oranges. In this case, the difference is 71 - 60 = 11 bags. Therefore, there are 11 more bags of unripe oranges than bags of ripe oranges.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessee's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide. So, if we divide the length of the room (12) by its width (11), we get: $ \frac{12}{11} = 1.09$  Therefore, Jessee's room is approximately 10% longer than it is wide.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 7 feet long (length). Now, she needs 14 square feet of carpet area to cover her room. Since the length of the room is 7 feet, the width of the room can be calculated as follows: Width = Length x Area Required / Total Area  Width = 7 x 14 / 32 = 5 feet Therefore, Jessie's room is 5 feet wide.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie's room is 7 feet wide (in meters, this would be approximately 2.1 meters). Next, we are told that she needs a carpet with an area of 14 square feet (approximately 1.3 square meters). Finally, we are asked to find out how long Jessie's room is in feet. To do this, we can use the fact that there are 0.3048 meters in one foot, so: Room length = Carpet area / Width x Length = 14 sq ft / 2.1 m x? =? feet Therefore, Jessie's room is approximately 6.5 feet long (or 2 meters).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessee's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, which means its area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since there are already 16 square feet of carpet in the room, we need to find out how much more carpet is required to cover the entire floor. To do this, we can divide the total area of the room (165 square feet) by the area covered by the existing carpet (16 square feet): 165 / 16 = 10 Additional square feet of carpet are needed to cover the entire floor. Therefore, the answer is 10 additional square feet of carpet are needed.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many feet are there in total length of Jessie's room. Since it is 2 feet long, we have:  Length = 2 feet = 0.667 meters (since 1 foot = 0.3048 meters) So, the total length of Jessie's room is: Total length = 0.667 meters x 12 feet = 7.952 meters Now, let's calculate the area of each tile: Area of each tile = 4 square feet = 0.04 square meters ( since 1 square foot = 0.0929 square meters ) Therefore, the number of tiles required to cover the entire floor of Jessie's room can be calculated as follows: Number of tiles = Total length / Area of each tile = 7.952 meters / 0.04 square meters = 198.5 tiles
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many square feet of carpet are required for one room. Since each room is 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, its area can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 19 x 18 = 342 sq ft Now, since there are 20 rooms in total, we need to multiply the area of one room by 20 to get the total area of all the rooms: Total Area = 20 x 342 sq ft = 6,840 sq ft Therefore, to cover all the floors with carpet, we need 6,840 sq ft of carpet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessee's room is 19 feet wide and 20 feet long. So, the length of the room is greater than its width. Now, let's calculate the ratio of the length to the width: Length / Width = 20 / 19 = 1.05278 (approximately) Therefore, Jessee's room is approximately 10.53 times longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet to cover her room. Since the length of the room is 5 feet, we can calculate the width as follows: Width = Length x Area per foot = 5 x 10 = 50 square feet Therefore, the width of Jessie's room is 50 square feet.
Response:  We know that Jessie needs 10 square feet of carpet to cover her room. Since the width of her room is 2 feet, we can calculate its length as follows: Length = Width x Area Required = 2 x 10 = 20 feet So, the length of Jessie's room is 20 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessee has an 18 square foot carpet and her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. To cover the entire floor area of the room, she needs additional carpeting to fill in any gaps between the walls and the edges of the existing carpet. So, let's calculate how much extra carpeting she needs based on the dimensions of the room: Length = 4 feet x Width = 20 feet = 80 square feet Total area of the room = 18 square feet (existing carpet) + 80 square feet (extra carpet needed) = 98 square feet Therefore, Jessee needs 98 square feet of additional carpeting to completely cover the floor of her room.
Response:  The shop makes $23 profit per t-shirt sold. So if they sell x t-shirts, their total profit will be $23x. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold $230 in t-shirts. To find out how many t-shirts they sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per t-shirt: $230 / $23 = x. Therefore, the shop sold 9 t-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that Rayzer Back's T-shirt shop sold 3 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas game and earned $51 in total. Since we are asked about the price of one T-shirt, let's assume that each T-shirt was priced at the same amount as the total revenue divided by the number of T-shirts sold. Therefore, the price of one T-shirt is: $51 / 3 = $17 per T-shirt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the shop sells one T-shirt for $87 per piece. So, if they sell 95 pieces of T-shirts in total, their revenue from T-shirt sales would be: 95 x $87 = $8325. Now, let's assume that they sold 47 pieces of T-shirts during the Arkansas game. Therefore, their revenue from T-shirt sales during the Arkansas game would be: 47 x $87 = $4069. So, the total amount of money earned through T-shirt sales is: $8325 + $4069 = $12394.
Response:  The shop sells $106 per T-shirt. So, if they sell x T-shirts in total, their revenue will be $x \* $106 = 106x.  In one game, they sold 115 T-shirts, so their revenue was $115 \* $106 = 12,390.  In another game, they sold x - 115 T-shirts, so their revenue was $x \* $106 = (x - 115) \* $106 = 8,745. Therefore, the number of T-shirts sold in the other game is 8,745 - 115 = 8,630.
Response:  The shop sells one T-shirt for $98 each time. So, if they sell x T-shirts in total, their revenue will be $x \times $98 = $98x.  In this case, they sold a total of 163 T-shirts between two games (Arkansas and Texas Tech). If they sold 89 T-shirts at Arkansas game, then the revenue from Arkansas game is $89 \times $98 = $8572.  Therefore, the revenue from Arkansas game is $8572, and the remaining amount ($8572 - $89) is $8483.
Response:  The shop sells one T-shirt for $78 each time. So, if they sell 186 T-shirts in total (including both Arkansas and Texas games), their total revenue would be: 186 x $78 = $14,508 Total Revenue Now, let's calculate how much money the shop made from each game separately: For Arkansas game: 172 T-shirts x $78 per shirt = $13,096 For Texas game: 186 - 172 = 14 T-shirts x $78 per shirt = $1,104 Total Money Made From Each Game = $13,096 + $1,104 = $14,200 Therefore, the shop made $14,200 from both games combined.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Shop made $62 profit from selling one T-shirt and $99 profit from selling one jersey.  Therefore, if they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 jerseys during the Arkansas vs Texas game, their total profit would be:  Profit from T-shirts = 183 x ($62/1) = $11,540 Profit from Jerseys = 31 x ($99/1) = $3,079 Total Profit = $11,540 + $3,079 = $14,619 So, the Razorback Shop made $14,619 in profit during the Arkansas vs Texas game.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Shop sold 74 T-shirts and 156 jeans during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. We are also given that the profit per T-shirt is $67 and the profit per jean is $165. Therefore, to find out how much profit they made from selling these clothes, we can use the following formula: Profit = Number of items x Profit per item So, for T-shirts, the profit would be: Profit (T-shirts) = 74 x $67 = $4890 For jeans, the profit would be: Profit (jeans) = 156 x $165 = $25,340 In total, the Razorback Shop made $29,830 in profits from selling these clothes.
Response:  We know that the profit from selling one T-shirt is $192 and the profit from selling one jeans is $34. So, if they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jeans, their total profit would be: Profit = (Number of T-shirts x Profit per T-shirt) + (Number of Jeans x Profit per Jeans)  Profit = (157 x $192) + (19 x $34)  Profit = $28,606 + $668  Profit = $29,274 Therefore, the price of each T-shirt is higher than the price of each jeans.
Response:  We know that the profit from selling one T-shirt is $86 and the profit from selling one jersey is $232. So, if they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys, their total profit would be: Profit = (Number of T-shirts x Profit per T-shirt) + (Number of jerseys x Profit per jersey)  Profit = (254 x $86) + (43 x $232) Profit = $20,972 + $9,666 Profit = $29,638 Therefore, the price of each jersey is $29,638 / 43 = $690.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one T-shirt is sold for $51. So, if 130 T-shirts are sold, the total revenue from selling T-shirts would be:  Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 130 x $51 = $6,430. Now, we are given that there is an discount of $8 per T-shirt during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game. So, the amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during the game would be: Earning = Revenue - Discount = $6,430 - (130 x $8) = $6,430 - $972 = $5,458. Therefore, the shop earned $5,458 from selling T-shirts during the Arkansas vs Texas Tech game.
Response:  The shop sells each T-shirt for $201 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 14 T-shirts. So, the total revenue from T-shirt sales is: 14 x $201 = $2854. Therefore, the amount of money the shop made from T-shirt sales is $2854.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is $60 and each T-shirt costs $10. So, we can write an equation as follows:  $60 = x \times $10 where x represents the number of T-shirts sold. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $10: x = $60 / $10 = 6. Therefore, they sold 6 T-shirts in total.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts is $215 and there are 5 T-shirts in total. So, we can calculate the price of each T-shirt as follows: Price = Total Amount / Number of T-shirts = $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt.
Response:  The profit from selling one T-shirt is $215, and the number of T-shirts sold was 20. Therefore, the total profit from selling T-shirts is:  Profit from T-shirts = Number of T-shirts x Profit per T-shirt = 20 x $215 = $4,300. Similarly, the profit from selling one jersey is $5, and the number of jerseys sold was 64. Therefore, the total profit from selling jerseys is:  Profit from Jerseys = Number of Jerseys x Profit per Jersey = 64 x $5 = $320. So, the total profit for both T-shirts and jerseys together is: Total Profit = Profit from T-shirts + Profit from Jerseys = $4,300 + $320 = $4,620.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Shop made $76 per jersey and $204 per t-shirt. So, if they sold 158 jerseys and 2 t-shirts, their total revenue would be: Revenue = Number of jerseys x Price per jersey + Number of t-shirts x Price per t-shirt  Revenue = 158 x $76 + 2 x $204 = $13,968 + $408 = $14,376 Therefore, the profit from selling jerseys is $14,376 - $7,692 = $6,684.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Razorback Shop made $210 per jersey and $240 per t-shirt. So, if they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys, their total revenue from these items would be: Revenue from t-shirts = $240 x 177 = $43,860 Revenue from jerseys = $240 x 23 = $5,520 Now, let's find out how much more money they made from selling t-shirts than jerseys. Difference in revenue = Total revenue from t-shirts - Total revenue from jerseys = $43,860 - $5,520 = $38,340 Therefore, the price of each t-shirt is $38.34 higher than the price of each jersey.
Response:  The profit from selling one jersey is $115 and for selling one t-shirt it is $25. So, if they sold 78 jerseys, their total profit from jerseys would be: 78 x $115 = $9030. Similarly, if they sold 113 t-shirts, their total profit from t-shirts would be: 113 x $25 = $2725. Now, we need to find out how much more money they made from selling jerseys than from selling t-shirts. To do this, we subtract the profit from t-shirts ($2725) from the profit from jerseys ($9030): $9030 - $2725 = $6305. Therefore, the price of each jersey is $6305 / 78 = $82.46 per jersey.
Response:  If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is:  5 x 10 = 50 chairs.  Now, we need to find out how many more chairs there are than tables. So, if there are 50 chairs and 5 sets of tables, the number of chairs per table is: 50 / 5 = 10 chairs per table. Therefore, there are 10 extra chairs than tables.
Response:  We know that there are two tables and each table has the same number of chairs. So, the total number of chairs is twice the number of chairs at one table. Since there are 12 chairs in the backyard, the number of chairs at each table is 6 (12 / 2 = 6).
Response:  We know that there are 3 chairs at each table and they want to hold a party in their backyard with 3 tables. So, the total number of chairs they will have is 3 x 3 = 9 chairs. Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that there are 11 sets of tables and each set has 13 chairs. So, in total, how many chairs do they have?  Yes, that's right! They have 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.
Response:  If they have 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60.  Now, if there are 11 people sitting in the chairs, that means there are 60 - 11 = 49 unused chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Now, we also know that there are 6 extra chairs, which means the total number of chairs including the extra ones is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs. So, the number of guest chairs is 174.
Response:  We know that there are 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 4 x 3 = 12 chairs. Since there will be 14 people participating in the party, we need to buy additional 2 chairs (to accommodate all participants). Therefore, the answer is 12 + 2 = 14 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are 14 chairs for each table set and they have decided to hold a party in their own garden with 9 table sets. So, we need to find out how many chairs they will have in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of table sets by the number of chairs per table set: 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. Therefore, there are 126 more chairs than tables at the party.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Louis earned $460 in total during the 5 weeks of harvesting. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

$460 = x \times 5 (where x is the amount earned per week)

Now, we are asked to find out how much Louis earned per week. To do this, we need to solve for 'x' in the above equation.

So, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

$92 = x

Therefore, Louis earned $92 per week during the 5 weeks of harvesting."
Response:  If Louis earned $1216 during harvest and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate how many weeks it took him to harvest that amount as follows: $$ \text {Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total amount earned}}{ \text{Weekly income}} $$ Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: $$ \text {Number of weeks} = \frac{1216}{16} = 78 $$ So, Louis harvested for 78 weeks.
Response:  Louis earns $21 per week for 216 weeks (or 5 years) and pays no taxes during this period. At the end of the harvest season, he has saved $21 x 216 = $4388 in his account. So, at the end of the 5-year period, Louis has $4388 + $21 x 5 = $7940 in his account.
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate how much Louis earned during one season. We are given that he earns $1357 per week, so in one season (which is 223 weeks long), he will have earned:

$1357 x 223 = $294,613

Now, we need to find out how many seasons Louis worked in total. The question states that he worked for 73 seasons. So, we can multiply the amount of money he earned in one season by the number of seasons he worked:

$294,613 x 73 = $20,833,333

Therefore, if Louis worked for 73 seasons and earned $1357 per week, he would have earned a total of $20,833,333."
Response:  During the harvest period of 1091 weeks (or 2 years and 4 months), Louis earns $28 per week. Additionally, he works overtime every week and earns $939 per week. So, if he works overtime every week during the harvest period, how much will he earn in total? Total amount earned = Number of weeks worked x Weekly income + Overtime income In this case, the number of weeks worked is equal to the harvest period of 1091 weeks. Therefore, we can calculate the total amount earned as follows: Total amount earned = 1091 weeks x $28/week + 52 weeks x $939/week = $27,648 + $48,678 = $76,326 This means that if Louis works overtime every week during the harvest period, he will earn a total of $76,326.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Louis earns $403 per week during the harvest season. 
Secondly, he pays $49 in rent every week. Therefore, his total income minus rent is:  
$403 - $49 = $354 per week. 
Now, let's calculate how much Louis earns over the entire harvest period of 233 weeks: 
$354 x 233 = $81,672! So, Louis earns approximately $81,672 during the harvest season."
Response:  Louis earns $368 per week and pays $388 in rent every week. To find out how much he pays in rent during the harvest period of 1359 weeks, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks in the harvest period: $368 x 1359 = $472,072 So, Louis pays $472,072 in rent during the harvest period.
Response:  Louis earns $491 per week during the harvest season and pays $216 in rent each week. How much money does he have left after paying his rent? To find out, we need to subtract his rent from his income. So, let's do that: $491 - $216 = $275 This means that Louis has $275 left after paying his rent.
"Response: 
We know that Louis earned $133 in total during his harvest season of 19 weeks. To find out how much he earned per week, we can divide the total amount he earned by the number of weeks he worked:
$133 / 19 = $7 per week
So, Louis earned $7 per week during his harvest season."
Response:  Louis earns $2 per week during harvest time. Since he earned a total of $178, that means he worked for 89 weeks ( $178 / $2/week = 89 weeks). Therefore, the harvest lasted for 89 weeks.
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. If the water is 10 times deeper than Dean's height, and his height is 9 feet, how deep will the water be? We can start by converting both measurements to the same unit of measurement, such as meters or feet.  Height of Dean = 9 feet = 2.74 meters (conversion factor: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters) Water depth = 10 times Dean's height = 10 x 2.74 meters = 27.4 meters
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The depth of the water is twice as deep as Dean's height. Dean is shorter than Ron by 8 feet. If Ron stands at 14 feet tall, how deep was the water?  We can start by using the information that the depth of the water is twice as deep as Dean's height. So if Dean's height is x feet, then the depth of the water is 2x feet. Since Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, we know that Ron's height is 14 - 8 = 6 feet taller than Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 2(x + 6) feet. Solving for x, we get x = 7 feet. So the depth of the water was 14 feet.
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water depth is 5 times Ron's height. Dean is shorter than Ron by 11 feet. If Ron stands at 12 feet tall, how deep will the water be?  We can start by using the formula for finding the volume of a rectangular prism: Volume = Length x Width x Height In this case, we know that the length and width are equal (since it's a rectangular shape), so we can simplify the equation to: Volume = Height x (Length + Width) Now, we have some given values: * Ron's height is 6 feet (72 inches) * Dean is 9 feet less than Ron (Dean's height is 63 inches) So, if Ron stands at 12 feet tall, his height is now 72 + 12 = 84 inches. And since Dean is 9 feet less, his height is 63 - 9 = 54 inches. Now we can use these values to find the volume of the water: Volume = Height x (Length + Width) = 84 x (12 + 10) = 1008 cubic inches Now, there are 1728 cubic inches in a foot, so...
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water depth is 15 times Devin's height. Devin is taller than Ron by 4 feet. If Ron stands at 13 feet while in the water, what is the water depth?  Water depth = 15 x Devin's height = 15 x (7 ft) = 105 ft
Response:  After resting, they decided to go swimming. The water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet tall, how deep is the water?  We can start by using the fact that the water is 16 times deeper than Ron's height. So if Ron's height is x feet, then the depth of the water is 16x feet. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we know that Dean's height is x + 9 feet. Now we need to find out what happens when Ron stands at 13 feet tall. In this case, the depth of the water would be 16(13) = 198 feet.
Response:  We know that after their break, they decided to go swimming. The water is 9 times deeper than Dean's height. Since Ron is shorter than Dean by 6 feet, we can calculate the depth of the water as follows: Water Depth = Dean's Height x 9 = 180 feet (since Dean's height is 20 feet) Now, let's convert this value from feet to meters: Water Depth (m) = 180 / 3 = 60 meters Therefore, the depth of the water is 60 meters.
Response:  Brian has 34 books and he wants to put them in two bookshelves equally. So, if we divide 34 by 2, we get 17 books per shelf.
Response:  Brian has 42 books in total and each shelf contains 2 books. Therefore, there are 42/2 = 21 shelves. So, Brian has 21 shelves of books.
Response:  Brian has 23 bookshelves and each shelf contains 27 books. Therefore, he has a total of 23 x 27 = 591 books. Additionally, he has 80 magazines, which we will add to the total number of books. So, the final answer is 591 + 80 = 671 books that Brian possesses.
Response:  Brian has 10 bookshelves with 9 books each, so he has 9 x 10 = 90 books in total. Additionally, he has 46 magazines, which are not included in the count of books. Therefore, the number of magazines Brian possesses is 46.  So, the answer is 90 + 46 = 136.
Response:  Brian has 29 bookshelves and each shelf contains 23 books, so he has a total of 29 x 23 = 753 books. Additionally, he has 61 magazines, which we will add to the total number of books. Therefore, Brian possesses a total of 753 + 61 = 814 items in his book collection.
Response:  Brian has 7 bookshelves and each shelf contains an equal number of books. Therefore, the total number of books Brian owns is 7 x 7 = 49 books. So, there are 49 books in total.
Response:  Brian has 38 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books. Therefore, there are 38 / 2 = 19 bookshelves. So, Brian has 19 bookshelves.
Response:  Carol has bought two invitation cards for her party and wants to send them to ten friends. To make sure that no friend receives another invitation card from someone else, she needs to buy $ \frac{10}{2} = 5$ packs of invitation cards. Therefore, the answer is $5$.
Response:  Carol sent invitations to 12 friends for her birthday party. Since she bought 3 packs of invitations, and each pack contains the same number of invitations, we can conclude that there are 3 x 12 = 36 invitations in total. So, there are 36 invitations in one pack.
Response:  Carol bought 7 packs of invitation cards, and each pack contains 10 invitations in total. So, she has purchased 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she sent two invitations to her friends, we need to subtract that number from the total amount of invitations she purchased. Therefore, the remaining invitations are 70 - 2 = 68.
Response:  Carol bought 6 packs of invitation cards, and each pack contains 14 invitations in total. So, she has purchased 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, she also bought additional 11 invitations, making the total number of invitations she can send out to be 84 + 11 = 95 friends. Therefore, Carol can invite 95 friends to her party.
Response:  Carol wants to invite 9 friends for her birthday party and she has already bought two packs of invitation cards with 3 cards each. So, in total, she has 6 cards (2 x 3 = 6). To invite 9 friends, she needs an additional 3 cards (9 - 6 = 3). Therefore, Carol needs to buy 3 extra invitation cards.
Response:  Melissa scored 12 points in each of the 3 games she played. So, she scored a total of 36 points. Since there are 3 games, we can write an equation: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 Now, let's solve for the number of games: 36 / 12 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  Melissa played three games and got a total of 81 points. If she had received the same number of points in each game, then... (1) She would have scored 27 points in the first game, since 81 / 3 = 27. (2) She would have scored 27 points in the second game, since 27 x 2 = 54. (3) She would have scored 27 points in the third game, since 54 x 2 = 108. Therefore, Melissa scored 27 points in one game.
Response:  Melissa scored 109 points in each match and obtained 82 bonus points for each match. Therefore, her total score can be calculated as follows: Total score = (Number of matches x Score per match) + (Bonus points x Number of matches) In this case, the number of matches is 79, so we can calculate the total score as follows: Total score = (79 x 109) + (79 x 82) = 8,563 + 6,455 = 14,918 points So, Melissa scored 14,918 points in total.
Response:  Melissa has obtained a total of 21 points from playing several games. She scored 7 points in each game she played. Therefore, the number of games Melissa played is:  21 / 7 = 3 games  So, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  Melissa played 13 games and scored a total of 91 points. Since she scored the same number of points in each game, we can assume that her scoring average is also equal to her total score divided by the number of games she played. So, we have: Points per game = Total points / Number of games Points per game = 91 / 13  Points per game = 7  Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points per game.
Response:  Since there are 4 seats in the observatory car of Paradise Park, and at most 20 people can ride it at once, we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many people can sit in each seat. So, the answer is 5 people per seat.
"Response:  We know that there are x seats in the roller coaster car. Since each seat can accommodate 9 people, we have:
x × 9 = 18
Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies this equation. Solving for x, we get:
x = 2
So, there are 2 seats in the roller coaster car."
Response:  Since each Feris Wheel has 19 seats and 15 people can sit in one seat, we have: Total number of people who can sit in all 20 Ferris Wheels = Number of people who can sit in one Ferris Wheel x Number of Ferris Wheels So, total number of people who can sit in all 20 Ferris Wheels is: 19 x 20 = 380 people
Response:  Since there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people, we have a total capacity of 18 x 15 = 270 people. Now, if 10 seats are broken or unavailable, that means only 18 x 15 - 10 = 240 people can ride the Ferris wheel at once. Therefore, the answer is 240 people.
Response:  We know that there are 6 seats in the roller coaster and each seat can accommodate 14 people. So, the total capacity of the roller coaster is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Currently, 16 people are already seated in the roller coaster, leaving us with 84 - 16 = 68 additional people who can be seated. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can be seated in the roller coaster at any given time is 68.
Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the roller coaster car. If we assume that each small seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total capacity of the small seats is: 2 x 14 = 28 people. Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the large seats: 23 x 54 = 1208 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the roller coaster car is: 28 + 1208 = 1236 people. So, the answer is 1236.
Response:  Small seats can accommodate 16 people, and large seats can accommodate 12 people. So, if we want to know how many people can ride the Ferris wheel with big seats only, we need to subtract the number of people who can sit in small seats from the total capacity of the Ferris wheel. Therefore, the answer is: 12 - 16 = -4 people. So, there are -4 people who can ride the Ferris wheel with big seats only.
Response:  Since there are 16 people who can ride at the same time in Paradise Park's observation car, and there are 4 seats available in each seat, we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people can sit in one seat. Therefore, 1 person can sit in 16/4 = 4 seats.
Response:  Since 4 people can ride at once in the roller coaster of Paradise Park, and each seat has space for 2 people, we have: Number of seats = Total number of riders / Number of people per seat So, if there are 4 riders, and each rider takes up 1 seat, then: Number of seats = 4 / 2 = 2 seats Now, let's check our answer: Is the number of seats equal to the total number of riders? Yes! That means that there are 2 seats in the roller coaster of Paradise Park.
Response:  We ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices as there are total slices (14). So, if we divide 14 by 7, we get the number of slices in each pizza = 2.
Response:  We have ordered pizza with 2 slices per pie and there are total of 28 slices in all. So, we need to divide 28 slices among 3 pies. To do this, we can use division.  Therefore, we have ordered 9 slices of pizza (28 / 3 = 9).
Response:  We have ordered 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. So, we need to calculate how many slices are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of pizzas with the number of slices per pizza: 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Therefore, there will be 68 slices of pizza for 25 people.
Response:  We ordered 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we want to divide them equally among 2 people, how many slices will each person get?  To find out, let's divide 9 (the number of pizzas) by 2 (the number of people): 9 / 2 = 4.5 pizzas per person. Since you can't have half a pizza, each person will get 4 whole pizzas. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  Since Page and his mother planted several species of flowers in different flower beds, we can assume that each flower bed has at least one type of flower. Therefore, if there are 45 flower beds, then there are at least 45 types of flowers.  Now, let's consider how many seeds Page and his mother planted for each type of flower. According to the question, they planted 10 seeds per flower bed. So, if there are x types of flowers, then they planted a total of 10x seeds.  We know that the total number of seeds is equal to the product of the number of types of flowers and the number of seeds planted per flower bed. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of seeds = (Number of types of flowers) × (Number of seeds planted per flower bed)  In this case, the number of types of flowers is 45, and the number of seeds planted per flower bed is 10. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get:  Number of seeds = 45 × 10 = 450 seeds  Therefore, Page and his mother planted a total of 450 seeds.
Response:  Since Page helped her mother plant flowers in 9 flower beds, and each flower bed has the same number of seeds, we can conclude that Page planted 45 seeds in total. Therefore, the answer is 45.
Response:  We know that Page helped his mother plant 36 seeds in total. Since each flowerbed has 12 seeds and there are 58 flowers in total, we can deduce that there are 5 flower beds. Therefore, Page had 5 flower beds.
"Response: 
Page helped his mother plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds in total. Each flowerbed had 15 seeds, and each flowerbed produced 60 flowers that bloomed. So, how many flowers did Page help his mother grow?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of seeds planted (55) by the number of flower beds (3). Then, we add the result to the number of flowers that grew in each flower bed (60): 55 x 3 = 165 + 60 = 225 flowers. Therefore, Page helped his mother grow 225 flowers."
Response:  If Page and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of the 6 flower beds, then the total number of seeds they planted is: 10 x 6 = 60 seeds. So, if they planted 60 seeds altogether, they must have had 6 flower beds.
Response:  Since Page planted flowers with her mother in 8 different flower beds, and they together planted a total of 32 species of flowers, we can say that each flower bed has 4 (32 / 8) species of flowers.
Response:  If Mashu has 11 friends and gives each of them 2 crackers, then the total number of crackers given out is:  11 x 2 = 22 crackers. So, Mashu now has 22 - 2 = 20 crackers left.
Response:  If Mashu gave away 8 crackers to his friends and he gave 1 friend 2 crackers, then the number of friends he gave crackers to is: 8 - (1 x 2) = 6 So, Mashu gave crackers to 6 friends.
Response:  Маshu has 15 crackers and wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So he will give each friend 3 crackers (15 / 5 = 3). Now, after giving the crackers away, there are 10 crackers left (15 - 3 x 5 = 10). Therefore, each friend got 3 crackers, and there are 10 crackers left.
Response:  Машиュー has 24 crackers and wants to share them equally among 3 friends. So, each friend will get 8 crackers (24 / 3 = 8). Now, after giving these crackers to their friends, Машию still has 17 crackers left (24 - 8 = 17). Therefore, Машию gave 8 crackers to each of his 3 friends.
"Response: 
Masaru has 22 crackers and 34 cakes to share among 11 friends. To find out how many crackers each friend will get, we can divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends: 22 / 11 = 2 crackers per friend.  Therefore, each friend will eat 2 crackers."
Response:  Маши (Mashu) has 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If he wants to divide them equally among his two friends, then each friend will get:  Number of crackers = Total number of crackers / Number of friends = 29 / 2 = 14 crackers per friend.  Number of cakes = Total number of cakes / Number of friends = 30 / 2 = 15 cakes per friend. Therefore, each friend will eat 14 crackers and 15 cakes.
Response:  Машиュー has 14 crackers and 21 pieces of cake. If he wants to divide them equally among 7 friends, each friend will get: 14/7 = 2 crackers and 21/7 = 3 cakes. So, each person will eat 2 crackers and 3 cakes.
Response:  If Mashu distributed an equal number of crackers to 18 friends, then he gave each friend x crackers, where x is a positive integer. Since there are 36 crackers in total, we can write the equation: 36 = 18x. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. So, each friend received 2 crackers from Mashu.
Response:  If Masaru has given away 6 crackers to one friend, and he had 36 crackers initially, then he must have had 36 - 6 = 30 crackers left after giving away 6 crackers. So, he gave away crackers to 30 friends.
Response:  Машиュー had 23 crackers and divided them equally among his 2 friends, so each friend got 11 crackers (since 2 x 11 = 22). So, after distributing the crackers, 11 crackers were left with Машиュー.
Response:  Машиュー has 31 crackers and he wants to share them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 6 crackers (31 / 5 = 6). Now, after sharing, 23 crackers are left (31 - 6 = 23). Therefore, Машиュー gave 6 crackers to each of his 5 friends.
"Response: 
1. There are 4 friends and they want to divide the crackers equally among them. So, if there were initially 32 crackers, each friend would get 32/4 = 8 crackers. 
2. Now, let's consider the cake. If there were initially 98 pieces of cake, and each friend got 8 crackers, then each friend would also get 98/8 = 12 pieces of cake."
Response:  Маши (Mashu) gave each of his four friends an equal number of crackers and cakes. Initially, he had 10 crackers and 8 cakes, so the total number of crackers is 10 + 4 = 14, and the total number of cakes is 8 + 4 = 12. Since each friend got an equal share, the number of crackers or cakes each person received is 14/4 = 3.5 or 12/4 = 3. So, each person ate 3 or 3.5 pieces of cake, respectively.
Response:  Машиー (Mashu) gave each of his 28 friends an equal number of crackers and cakes. At first, Mashu had 13 crackers and 15 cakes in total. If we assume that each friend received an equal amount of both crackers and cakes, then the number of crackers and cakes each person received can be calculated as follows: Number of crackers = Total number of crackers / Number of people = 13 / 28 = 0.467 (approximately 1/2) Number of cakes = Total number of cakes / Number of people = 15 / 28 = 0.571 (approximately 1/2) So, each person received approximately half a cracker and half a cake.
Response:  Debbie bought some water bottles during a sale and drank 109 bottles in one day. Since she had them for 74 days, we can calculate how many bottles she bought as follows: Number of bottles = Daily consumption x Days held = 109 x 74 = 8260 bottles So, Debbie bought 8260 bottles.
Response:  Debbie bought 153 bottles of water during the sale and drank the same number every day for 17 days. So, if she drank x bottles per day, then after 17 days, she would have drunk 153x bottles in total. Since she only had 17 days to drink all those bottles, we can set up an equation as follows: 153x = 17t where t is the number of days Debbie drank water. Solving for x, we get: x = 9.26 (approximately) Therefore, Debbie drank approximately 9.26 bottles of water per day.
Response:  Debbie bought 264 bottles of water during the sale and drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days. So, the total number of bottles she has left is: Total = Number of bottles purchased - Number of bottles drunk = 264 - (11 x 15) = 264 - 165 = 99 bottles Therefore, Debbie still has 99 bottles of water left.
Response:  Debbie bought 301 bottles of water during the sale and drank 144 bottles per day for some days. So, the number of days she drank water is: Number of bottles drunk = 144 x Number of days = 301 / 144 = 2.1 days Therefore, Debbie drank water for approximately 2.1 days.
Response:  Debbie bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda during the sale. If she drank 4 bottles of water per day and 87 bottles of soda per day, then...
Response:  Debbie bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda during the sale. She drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day. To find out how many days she can keep drinking soda, we need to divide the number of bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day: Number of days = Number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day = 256 / 316 = 7.8 days So, Debbie can keep drinking soda for approximately 7.8 days.
Response:  Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day. So in one week, she will drink 6 x 7 = 42 bottles of water. Since she bought 12 bottles of water, she has enough for 42 days. Therefore, Debbie can hold her water for 42 days.
Response:  Debbie bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water. If she drank 15 bottles of water per day, then she had x bottles of water left after y days. Since she drank 54 bottles of soda per day, she had z bottles of soda left after y - 54 days. We know that x + z = 180 (total number of bottles of water purchased) and x + z - 15 = 95 (total number of bottles of soda purchased). Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us x = 63 and z = 127. Therefore, Debbie had 63 bottles of water left after 7 days and 127 bottles of soda left after 7 - 54 = 2 days.
Response:  Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water. If she drinks 122 bottles of water per day, then how many days will it take her to finish all the water?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of water bottles = 162 Days = 162 / 122 = 1.34 days So, Debbie will finish all the water in approximately 1.34 days. Now, let's find out how long it will take her to finish all the soda: Number of soda bottles = 360 Days = 360 / 9 = 40 days So, Debbie will finish all the soda in approximately 40 days.
Response:  If there are 11 pens in total and they are arranged in a row with 14 pens per row, then we have: Number of rows = Total number of pens / Number of pens per row = 11 / 14 = 3 rows. Therefore, Fei has 3 x 11 = 33 pens in total.
Response:  Since Fei arranged the 12 pens equally in 3 rows, each row has 4 pens ( since there are 12 pens and 3 rows, each row must have 4 pens). So, in total, there are 4 x 3 = 12 pens. Therefore, the answer is 12 pens.
Response:  If Fei has 28 packs of pencils with 24 pencils in each pack, then she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since each row needs 16 pencils, Fei can make 672 / 16 = 43 rows. Therefore, Fei can make 43 rows of pencils.
Response: フェイ has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 14 pencils. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 pencils.
Response:  If Fei has 35 pens and wants to arrange them in rows, she can do so in 35 different ways. Now, if we add the 7 pencils to the mix, she can arrange them in 35 + 7 = 42 different ways. So, there are 42 possible rows that Fei can create with her pens and pencils combined.
Response:  Since there are 4 pencils in each row and 3 rows, the total number of pencils is 4 x 3 = 12. So, Fei has 12 pencils.
Response: フェイ has 36 pens and 30 pencils. If she places them in one row with 7 columns, then... (1 row x 7 columns) = 7 x 36 = 252 pencils. So, フェイ has 252 pencils.
"Response: 
Fēi has 31 pens and 27 pencils in total. 
If she places each pen in one of the 11 rows, then how many pens will be in each row? 
Since there are 11 rows, the number of pens in each row is 31 / 11 = 2-3 pens per row. 
Similarly, if Fēi places each pencil in one of the 11 rows, then how many pencils will be in each row? Since there are 11 rows, the number of pencils in each row is 27 / 11 = 2-3 pencils per row.  Therefore, Fēi has a total of 64 pens (2 x 31) and 54 pencils (2 x 27)."
"Response:  If Fei has 30 pens and wants to arrange them in rows of 5 pens each, then she can create... (see details) 

Answer: 2 rows

Explanation:
Fei has 30 pens in total, and she wants to arrange them in rows of 5 pens each. Since there are 30 pens in total, we can only make 2 rows with 5 pens each. Therefore, the answer is 2 rows."
Response:  If Fei has 6 pens and wants to place them equally in two rows, she can place 3 pens in each row. So, the number of pens placed in each row is 3.
Response:  If Fei has 35 packs of pencils with each containing 4 pencils, then she has a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pencils.  Since she placed 2 pencils in one row, there are 140 / 2 = 70 rows that she can create. Therefore, Fei can create 70 rows of pencils.
Response:  If Fei has 31 packs of pencils and each pack contains 6 pencils, then she has a total of 31 x 6 = 186 pencils.
Response: フェイ has 71 pencils and 24 pens. If she places them in one row with 30 columns, then... (1) The number of pencils in each column is 71 / 30 = 2.36 pencils per column. Since we can't have a fraction of a pencil, let's round up to 3 pencils per column. (2) Therefore, the total number of pencils held by フェイ is 3 x 30 = 90 pencils. QED!
Response: フェイ (Fei) has 16 rows with 6 pencils and 21 pens. So, if we divide the number of pencils by the number of rows, we get: Number of pencils per row = 6 / 16 = 1/2 or 0.5 pencils per row. Now, let's count how many pencils Fei has in total: Total number of pencils = 0.5 x 21 = 10.5 pencils. Therefore, Fei has 10.5 pencils.
Response:  We know that there are 21 classrooms in the school and 98 students attending it. Also, we know that all buses are full, which means each bus has 7 seats (since there are 7 buses). So, to find out how many seats are available for each student, we can divide the total number of seats by the total number of students: Number of seats per student = Total number of seats / Total number of students = 7 seats/98 students = 0.73 seats per student Now, since the school is planning an excursion, let's assume that they want to allocate at least one seat per student on the bus. Therefore, the minimum number of seats required for the excursion will be equal to the total number of students multiplied by at least one seat per student: Minimum number of seats required = Total number of students x At least one seat per student = 98 students x 1 seat/student = 98 seats So, the answer to the question is 98 seats.
Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and 95 school buses with 118 seats per bus. So, we can calculate the total number of students as follows: Number of students = Total number of classrooms x Total number of school buses x Number of seats per bus Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of students = 84 x 95 x 118 = 86720 Therefore, there are approximately 86,720 students in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in the school and each classroom has 66 students. So, we have a total of 67 x 66 = 4232 students attending the school. Now, we need to find out how many buses are required for the field trip. Since one bus can accommodate 6 seats, we need to divide the number of students by 6 to get the number of buses required. Therefore, the answer is 4232 / 6 = 705 buses needed for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students (58). So, we have 58 x 87 = 4960 students participating in the field trip. Now, we need to find out how many buses are required to transport all these students. Since each bus has two seats, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to get the required number of buses: 4960 / 2 = 248 buses needed for the field trip. Therefore, the answer is 248.
Response:  We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students (120). So, we can assume that each classroom has 5 students (120/24 = 5). Now, let's calculate how many students are in each bus seat. Since there are 84 seats in the school bus, and 5 students per classroom, we have 84 x 5 = 420 students who will be going on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 66 classrooms in the school and 102 students attending it. Also, we have been told that each bus has 8 seats available for passengers. Now, let's calculate how many students can go on the field trip based on the number of buses available: Number of students who want to go on the field trip = Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go = 102 - 22 = 80 students Therefore, if 22 students do not want to go on the field trip, then 80 students will be able to go with the available 8 buses. So, the required number of buses is 80/8 = 10 buses.
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. Each bus can accommodate 99 students, so we have to find out how many buses will be needed for all the students to go on the field trip. Since 8 students do not want to go on the field trip, we need to subtract their number from the total number of students. Therefore, the number of students who will go on the field trip is: Total number of students - Number of students who don't want to go = 102 - 8 = 94 students. So, 94 students will go on the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in the school and each bus can accommodate 3 students. So, we need to find out how many trips the bus can make to transport all the students for the field trip. To do this, we divide the total number of students (111) by the capacity of each bus (3): Number of trips = Total number of students / Capacity of each bus = 111 / 3 = 37 trips Therefore, the school needs at least 37 buses for the field trip.
Response:  We know that there are 17 classrooms in the school and 46 buses. Since all buses are full, we have 46 x 92 = 408 seats available for students. Therefore, each bus has 408/17 = 24 seats.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in Heather's class who like to play marbles and Heather gives each of them 9 marbles, then we can calculate the total number of marbles Heather has given as follows: Number of marbles given = Total number of boys x Number of marbles given per boy  Here, the total number of boys is 11, and the number of marbles given per boy is 9. So, we can plug these values into the equation to get our final answer: Number of marbles given = 11 x 9 = 99 marbles Therefore, Heather has given 99 marbles to the boys in her class.
Response:  Heather has 10 beads and wants to give each of the boys 5 beads. So, she will give a total of 5 x 5 = 25 beads. Therefore, she gave beads to 25 boys.
Response:  There are 4 male students who like marbles and Heather has 23 marbles in total. She wants to keep 15 for herself, so she will give away 8 marbles (23 - 15 = 8). Now, each of the 4 male students will receive 2 marbles (8 / 4 = 2) from Heather.
Response:  If Hayley has 26 beads and there are 13 boys who like to play with beads, then each boy will receive 26/13 = 2 beads from Hayley.  Similarly, if there are 50 boys who like to play with cards, then each boy will receive 26/50 = 0.5 beads from Hayley. So, in total, each boy will receive 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 beads from Hayley.
Response:  Since Hayley has 20 beads and there are 2 male students in her class who like to play with them, we can assume that each of them will receive an equal number of beads from Hayley. So, if Hayley gives 10 beads to one student and 5 beads to the other, then they both have the same amount of beads (10 + 5 = 15). Therefore, the answer is 15.
Response:  If Hayley has 28 beads and wants to give each of the boys 2 beads, then she will have given away a total of 14 beads (2 x 7 = 14). So, there are 14 boys in this scenario.
"Response:  If Frank read 14 pages per day and the book has 392 pages, then he will finish reading the book in:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 392 / 14
= 27 days
Therefore, Frank took 27 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages of his favorite book every day and it took him 569 days to finish reading the entire book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days / Number of pages per day So, plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of pages = 569 / 22 Number of pages = 25.83 pages Now, since you cannot have a fraction of a page, we round up the result to the nearest whole number, which is 26 pages. Therefore, the book had 26 pages.
Response:  The book has 24 chapters with equal number of pages each (i.e., all chapters have 612/24 = 25 pages). Since Frank read the entire book in 6 days, he must have read x pages per day, where x is the total number of pages in the book. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 6x + 6x +... + 6x = 612 Now, let's simplify this equation using the distributive property: x + 6x = 3048 Finally, divide both sides by 6 to get the daily page count: x = 507 pages per day So, Frank read approximately 507 pages per day during his 6-day reading marathon!
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 220 days and it has 5 chapters equally divided into pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages per chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters = 555 pages / 5 chapters = 111 pages per chapter Now, let's find out how many pages are in each chapter: Chapter 1 : 111 pages Chapter 2 : 111 pages Chapter 3 : 111 pages Chapter 4 : 111 pages Chapter 5 : 111 pages Therefore, there are 111 pages in each chapter.
Response:  We know that Frank read 15 chapters of his favorite book and it has a total of 193 pages. To find out how many days he took to finish reading the book, we can use the formula: Time taken = Total number of pages / Number of chapters per day. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Time taken = 193 pages / 15 chapters/day = 660 days So, Frank took 660 days (or approximately 2 years) to finish reading his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank read several books and each book had 249 pages. So, if he took 3 days to read one book, then he must have spent 867 pages (3 x 249) reading in total. Now, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we divide the total number of pages he read by the number of days he took to read them: 867 pages / 3 days = 285 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 285 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank takes 12 days to read each book and there are x books in total, then he will take a total of 12x days to read all the books.  Since he took 492 days to read all the books, we can set up the equation:  12x = 492  Now, let's solve for x:  12x = 492  Divide both sides by 12:  x = 40 So, Frank read 40 books in total.
Response:  If Frank took 16 days to read his favorite book and it has 112 pages, we can calculate how many pages he read per day as follows: Page...
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages, it will take him:

576 / 8 = 72 days to read the entire book."
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 30 days and there are 41 chapters in the book. So, we can calculate the number of pages he read per day as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages in the book x Number of days taken to read the book / Number of chapters in the book Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Total number of pages in the book = 450 Chapters in the book = 41 Days taken to read the book = 30 Number of pages read per day =? To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of days taken to read it and then divide the result by the number of chapters in the book. Therefore, the answer is: Number of pages read per day = 450 x (30 / 41) = 14.6 Page/day
Response:  We know that Frank read his favorite book for 607 days and it has three chapters. Each chapter has 594 pages in total. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages each chapter contains as follows: Chapter 1 - 594 pages Chapter 2 - 594 pages Chapter 3 - 594 pages Total pages in the book - 1782 pages So, to answer your question, there are 1782 pages in Frank's favorite book.
"Response:  We know that Frank read 405 pages of his favorite book every day for 664 days. Therefore, he has read a total of 

$$ \text {Total number of pages read} = \text {Number of days} \times \text{Number of pages per day} $$

So, we can calculate the total number of pages Frank read as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text {Total number of pages read} &= 664 \times 405 \\ &= 273,800 \end{aligned} $$

Therefore, Frank read $273,800$ pages of his favorite book over $664$ days."
Response:  If we can buy one DVD for $120, that means we get 1/120 of something for that price. So, if we divide $120 by 1, we get $120. Therefore, the price of one pack is $120.
Response:  If $1 pack costs $81, then one DVD must cost $81 / 3 = $27. So, to buy 33 DVDs, you will need to pay $27 x 33 = $907.
Response:  We know that the price of one DVD is $107 and there is a discount of $106 for buying in bulk. So, if we buy x DVDs, we can get a total discount of $106x. Therefore, the cost per DVD after applying the discount is: Cost = $107 - $106x Now, to find out how many DVDs we can buy with $93, we need to divide the available budget by the cost per DVD: Number of DVDs = Available Budget / Cost per DVD = $93 / ($107 - $106x) Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 4 Therefore, you can buy 4 DVDs with $93.
Response:  If we buy one pack of DVDs at $76, there is a discount of $25 for buying in bulk. So, we can calculate the price per unit as follows: $76 / 2 = $38 per unit (without the discount) $38 x $25 = $95 per unit (with the discount) Therefore, to buy one pack of DVDs, we will pay $95.
"Response:  If you have $104 and each pack costs $26, then...

$104 / $26 = 4 packs
So, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs."
Response:  We know that there are 2 packs of DVDs and each pack contains 5 discs. So, in total, we have 2 x 5 = 10 DVDs. Now, we need to find out how much each DVD costs. Since there are 28 dollars available for buying these DVDs, we can calculate the cost per DVD as follows: Cost per DVD = Total amount available for buying DVDs / Number of DVDs = $28 / 10 = $2.80 per DVD Therefore, each DVD costs $2.80.
Response:  We have 18 bananas in total. If we divide them into groups of 2, then we can make 9 groups. So, there are 9 groups of bananas.
Response:  According to the question, there are 187 bananas in Philip's collection and they are divided into 140 groups. So, we can calculate the total number of bananas as follows: Total Number of Bananas = Number of Groups x Number of Bananas per Group Total Number of Bananas = 140 x 187 = 25,600 bananas Therefore, there are 25,600 bananas in Philip's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas in total and they are divided into 7 groups. So, the number of bananas in each group is:

Number of bananas per group = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 203 / 7 = 29

So, one group of bananas contains 29 bananas."
"Response: 
Philipp's collection contains 142 bananas and 356 oranges. 
The number of groups for bananas is 47, so each group has 142/47 = 3 bananas in it. 
For oranges, there are 178 groups, so each group has 356/178 = 2 oranges in it."
Response:  We know that Filippo's collection of bananas is divided into 196 groups. Therefore, we can say that each group contains an average number of bananas equal to 392 / 196 = 2 bananas per group.
Response:  We know that Filippo's collection of bananas is divided into groups of 18 bananas each. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas in each group So, if there are 180 total bananas and they are divided into groups of 18, we have: Number of groups = 180 / 18 = 10 groups. Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Filippo's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas in total and they are divided into two groups. So, the number of bananas in each group is:
Group 1: Number of bananas = Total number of bananas - Number of bananas in Group 2
= 290 - x
where x is the number of bananas in Group 2.
Since there are 93 oranges in total and they are divided into 93 groups, we can say that the number of oranges in each group is:
Number of oranges in each group = Total number of oranges - Number of oranges in Group 1
= 87 - y
where y is the number of oranges in Group 1.
Now, we have two equations:
Equation 1: Number of bananas in Group 1 = 290 - x
Equation 2: Number of oranges in Group 1 = 87 - y
We need to find the values of x and y. To do this, we can substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2:
Number of oranges in Group 1 = 87 - (290 - x)
Simplifying the equation:
Number of oranges in Group 1 = 87 - 203 + x
Solving for x:
x = 116
Therefore, the size of one group of bananas is 116 bananas."
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. Since the number of groups for each fruit is given as follows: Oranges - 16 groups Bananas - 345 groups From this information, we can calculate the total number of fruits in each group as follows: Oranges - 16 x 384 = 6072 fruits Bananas - 345 x 192 = 65,616 fruits Therefore, the size of one orange group is 6072 fruits.
Response:  Brenda's mother prepared cookies for the guests. She made 38 cookies in total and each cookie had 19 pieces. So, to find out how many guests she prepared cookies for, we can use division. We divide 38 (total number of cookies) by 19 (number of pieces per cookie): 38 / 19 = 2 Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 2 guests.
Response:  Brenda's mother made cookies for 14 people and each person received 30 cookies. So, in total, how many cookies did Brenda's mother make? 30 x 14 = 420 cookies. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies.
Response:  Brenda's mother made cookies for 5 people and prepared 22 cookies in total. If she didn't throw any away, then each person got an equal number of cookies (since she wanted to make sure everyone had the same amount). So, if there were x cookies per person, then the number of cookies each person got is x/5. Since Brenda's mother threw away 7 cookies, that means each person got 3x/5 cookies ( since 7 is equal to 3 times 2). Therefore, each person got 3(x/5) = 3x cookies.
Response:  Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 10 guests, but only 9 guests arrived. This means that Brenda's mother had 18 cookies in total (10 x 9 = 90). Now, let's assume each guest received an equal number of cookies. Therefore, if Brenda's mother gave each guest 3 cookies (since she had 3 times as many guests as she initially expected), then each guest would have received 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 cookies in total. So, the answer is 9.
Response:  Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for two guests. If each guest had an equal number of cookies as Brenda, then Brenda would have 7 cookies (since 14 / 2 = 7). So, Brenda has 7 cookies.
Response:  Brenda's mother prepared cookies for the guests, and each guest received 2 cookies in total. So, the number of cookies prepared is 10 (2 x 5). Now, we need to find out how many guests there were. Since each guest received 2 cookies, the total number of guests is 10 / 2 = 5 guests. Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 5 guests.
Response:  If Frank has 42 candies and wants to divide them equally into two bags, then each bag will have how many candies?  We can start by dividing 42 by 2, which gives us 21 candies per bag. So, there will be 21 candies in one bag and 21 candies in the other bag.
Response:  Frank has 33 candies in each of 26 bags, so he has a total of: 33 x 26 = 840 candies. Therefore, Frank has 840 candies in total.
Response:  Franks had 33 candies initially and lost 24 of them. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 candies left. To put these candies in one bag, we need to divide them into bags with 9 candies each. Therefore, the number of bags required is 9 / 1 = 9 bags.
"Response:  If Frank has 22 candies and he puts 11 of them in one bag, then he must have... See More
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer:  Let's think step by step.  If Frank has 22 candies and he puts 11 of them in one bag, then he must have 22 - 11 = 11 candies left over. So, if he wants to put all his remaining candies in bags, he will need 11 bags. Therefore, Frank has 11 bags."
Response:  Frank has 16 candies and he wants to put them in two bags equally. So, if he puts x candies in one bag, then the other bag will have 16 - x candies. Since we know that the total number of candies is 16, we can write an equation: x + (16 - x) = 16. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x = 16. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8. Therefore, Frank has 8 candies in each bag.
Response:  Sharlie sold 25 cases of Trefoil boxes. Each case contains 14 boxes. Therefore, Sharlie needs to deliver 25 x 14 = 350 boxes in total.
Response:  Sharlie sold 10 boxes of Treasure Fables. Since each case contains 5 boxes, we can conclude that... (calculate)...there are 50 boxes in total (10 boxes x 5 boxes/case).
Response:  We know that there are 67 regular sodas and 9 diet sodas in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Regular Sodas = Total Sodas - Diet Sodas Regula...
Response:  We know that there are 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Regular Soda = x Bottles Diet Soda = 61 - x Bottles Here, x is the number of extra bottles of diet soda compared to regular soda. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 61: x = (22 / 61) = 0.357 (approximately) Therefore, there are 35.7% more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.
"Response: 
Step 1: Count the number of regular soda bottles. According to the question, there are 30 regular soda bottles. So, we have: 
$$ \text{Regular soda bottles} = 30 $$
Step 2: Count the number of diet soda bottles. According to the question, there are 8 diet soda bottles. So, we have: 
$$ \text{Diet soda bottles} = 8 $$
Step 3: Add the total number of regular and diet soda bottles. We add $30 + 8 = 38$ bottles of soda. Therefore, the total number of bottles in the supermarket is: 
$$ \text{Total bottles} = 38 $$
Now let's count the number of apples. According to the question, there are 41 apples. So, we have: 
$$ \text{Apples} = 41 $$
Step 4: Find the total number of bottles and apples. Adding the total number of bottles and apples gives us the final answer: 
$$ \text{Total bottles and apples} = 38 + 41 = 79 $$
Therefore, the answer to the question is $79$."
Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. So, if we subtract the number of diet soda bottles from the total number of soda bottles, we get: 79 - 53 = 26. Therefore, there are 26 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 54 bottles of diet soda and 83 bottles of regular soda. Also, there are 12 apples. So, we can write an equation based on these values: Diet Soda Bottles = Regular Soda Bottles + Apples Now, let's solve for the number of regular soda bottles: Regular Soda Bottles = Diet Soda Bottles - Apples Substituting the value given in the question, we get: Regular Soda Bottles = 54 - 12 = 42 So, there are 42 bottles of regular soda more than the number of diet soda bottles.
Response:  We know that out of 17 bottles, 9 are regular soda bottles and 8 are diet soda bottles. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 8. Now, we need to find out how many limes each diet soda bottle contains. According to the problem statement, they have 29 limes in total. Since there are 8 diet soda bottles, the number of limes each bottle contains is 29/8 = 3.625 limes per bottle. Therefore, the number of diet soda bottles is 8 x 3.625 = 29.
Response:  We know that there are 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of bottles of regular soda = Total number of bottles - Number of bottles of diet soda  In this case, the total number of bottles is 19 + 60 = 79 bottles. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda is: 79 - 19 = 60 bottles. So, there are 60 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.
Response:  We know that there are 78 apples and 72 regular sodas. So, we can say that the total number of bottles is equal to the number of apples plus the number of regular sodas minus the number of diet sodas. Therefore, the total number of bottles = 78 + 72 - 32 = 146 bottles.
Response:  Supermarket has 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. It also has 54 bottles of diet soda. So, we have: Apples: 36 Bottles of regular soda: 80 Bottles of diet soda: 54 To find out how many more bottles of soda there are than apples, we can subtract the number of apples from the number of bottles of soda: 80 - 36 = 44 Therefore, there are 44 more bottles of soda than apples in the supermarket.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 30. Of those, 28 are regular soda bottles and 2 are diet soda bottles. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 2/30 = 1/15. Therefore, there are 15 diet soda bottles.
Response:  If the diet soda bottles have 4 bottles of diet soda and there are 79 more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of diet soda bottles + 79 We know that the total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of diet soda bottles and the number of regular soda bottles, so we can substitute this value into our equation: Number of regular soda bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of diet soda bottles + 79 Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of regular soda bottles = 4 + (Total number of bottles - 4) + 79 = 4 + (105 - 4) + 79 = 4 + 101 + 79 = 286 Therefore, there are 286 regular soda bottles.
"Response: 
1. Regular soda (57 bottles) + Diet soda (26 bottles) = Total number of regular and diet sodas = 83 bottles. 
2. Light soda (27 bottles) is added to the total number of regular and diet sodas = 83 + 27 = 110 bottles. Therefore, there are 110 bottles of soda in total."
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. So, if we add these two numbers together, we get... (81 + 60) = 141 bottles! Therefore, regular soda has 30 more bottles than diet soda.
"Response: 
Regular soda bottles = 49 x 
Diet soda bottles = 40 
Light soda bottles = 6 
Total regular and diet soda bottles =? 
To find the total number of regular and diet soda bottles, we need to add the number of regular soda bottles and diet soda bottles together. So, the answer is: Total = 49 + 40 = 89 bottles. Therefore, there are 89 bottles of regular and diet soda in total."
Response:  If there were 295 visitors yesterday and 317 visitors today, then the difference between the two days is:  317 - 295 = 22  So, there are 22 more visitors today than yesterday.
Response:  If 703 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday and today there are 246 visitors, then the total number of visitors in 25 days is: 703 + (246 x 24) = 703 + 58,960 = 59,663 people. Therefore, the answer is 59,663.
Response:  After they had their meal, Rachel found out that 100 people visited Buckingham Palace the day before. If there were 666 visitors in total that day, then how many more visitors came to the palace compared to the previous day? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of visitors from the previous day (100) from the total number of visitors that day (666): 666 - 100 = 566 So, there were 566 more visitors at Buckingham Palace that day compared to the previous day.
Response:  If they visited the palace after lunch and 132 people came to visit that day, then the number of visitors in total for the previous days would be:  Number of days = 327 days Total number of visitors = 132 visitors/day x 327 days = 40,840 visitors So, if there were 406 people who visited the palace during the 327-day period, then the number of visitors on the previous day would be: Number of visitors on previous day = 406 visitors / 327 days = 125 visitors
Response:  If 45 people visited the Buckingham Palace in the previous day and there were 85 days until now, then the total number of visitors to the palace during this period is:  Number of days = 85 Total number of visitors = 45 x 85 = 3675 So, if 829 people have visited the palace during this period, then the number of visitors on that particular day would be: Number of visitors on that day = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit = 3675 / 85 = 43  Therefore, 43 people visited Buckingham Palace on that particular day.
Response:  We know that there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace after the meal and Rachel learned this from them. The day before, there were 188 visitors. So, in total, there are 557 - 188 = 369 people who visited Buckingham Palace during the 57-day period.
Response:  We know that after they had lunch, they went to see Buckingham Palace and found out that there were 39 paintings inside. Then we are told that Rachel learned that 661 people visited Buckingham Palace that day. If we compare this with the previous day when there were 600 visitors, then we can deduce that there were 61 more visitors to the palace on that particular day compared to the previous day. So, the answer is 61.
Response:  If 92 people visited the Buckingham Palace yesterday and there were 419 people the day before that, then the number of visitors the day before was:  92 - 419 = -327 People.  Since there were 103 people the day before that, the number of visitors the day before that was:  103 + (-327) = 224 People. Therefore, the number of people who visited Buckingham Palace three days ago was 224.
"Response:  If we know that there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after they had lunch, and we also know that there were 471 visitors the previous day, then we can use these two pieces of information to calculate the total number of visitors over an 89-day period.  Here's how we can do it:

Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2 (after lunch): 512 visitors
.........
Day 89:???

To find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace on each of these days, we need to add up all the numbers from Day 1 to Day 89:

471 + 512 + 533 +... + 654 =???

As you can see, this is a simple arithmetic series where each term is equal to the previous term plus 100. So if we want to find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace on Day 89, we can simply add up all the terms in the series:

471 + 512 + 533 +... + 654 = 89 x 100 = 8,900

Therefore, there were 8,900 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days."
Response:  We know that in total there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace after they had dinner. The previous day, there were 191 visitors, and the day before that, there were 457 visitors. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 191 + 457 + 705 = 1343 people visited Buckingham Palace over the past 245 days. Therefore, the number of visitors who came to Buckingham Palace more than any other day is 1343 - 245 = 1108 people.
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required for the wings is 628 grams and the boy already has 159 grams. So, we need to find out how much more wax he needs. To do this, we can subtract the amount of wax he already has from the total amount of wax needed: 628 - 159 = 469 grams. Therefore, the boy needs 469 grams more of wax.
Response:  The total weight of wax required for attaching wings is 288 g, and currently he has 260 g. So, the remaining amount of wax needed is: 288 - 260 = 128 g.
Response:  The man needs 57g of paint to apply it to his checklist and he has already applied 22g of wax. So far, he has used a total of 79g (57 + 22) of materials. If he needs 353g of wax for his wings, that means he still needs 274g (353 - 79) more wax.
Response:  We know that the total weight of wax required is 166 grams and our friend currently has 20 grams. So, we need to find out how much more wax he needs to get the total amount. To do this, we can divide the total weight by the current weight: 166 g / 20 g = 8.3 g Therefore, our friend needs an additional 8.3 grams of wax.
Response:  We know that the total weight of wax required is 557g and the bird currently has 17g of wax. So, we need to find out how much wax the bird needs in total. To do this, we can divide the total weight of wax by the amount of wax the bird already has: 557g / 17g = 32.6g Therefore, the bird needs approximately 32.6g of wax in total.
Response:  We know that the total amount of wax required for the wings is 492 grams and our friend has already 11 grams of wax with him. So, we need to find out how many more grams of wax he needs to collect. To do this, we can divide the remaining amount of wax (i.e., 492 - 11 = 481) by the amount of wax he currently has (i.e., 11): Number of additional grams of wax needed = Remaining amount of wax / Amount of wax currently available = 481 / 11 = 43 grams Therefore, our friend needs an additional 43 grams of wax to complete his task.
Response:  We know that there are 94 farmers who will harvest grapes for 6 days. If each farmer can harvest 90 drums of grapes in 6 days, then the total number of drums of grapes harvested in 6 days is:  94 farmers x 90 drums/day = 8560 drums  Now, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are harvested per day. To do this, we divide the total number of drums harvested by the number of days:  8560 drums / 6 days = 1420 drums/day So, in one day, approximately 1420 drums of grapes are harvested.
Response:  We know that there are 266 farmers who will harvest 90 drums of grapes in 5 days. To find out how many drums of grapes each farmer will harvest per day, we can divide the total number of drums by the number of farmers: 90 drums / 266 farmers = 34 drums per day. Therefore, each farmer will harvest 34 drums of grapes per day.
Response:  We know that there are 294 farmers who harvest grapes and produce 244 drums of grapes per day. Additionally, they also collect 47 drums of raspberries per day. To calculate how many drums of grapes will be collected in total over 146 days, we can multiply the number of farmers by the amount of grapes each farmer produces per day: Number of drums of grapes = 294 farmers x 244 drums/day = 65,832 drums Over the course of 146 days, this means that a total of: Total number of drums of grapes = 65,832 drums x 146 days = 9,606,640 drums Of course, this calculation assumes that the same number of farmers (294) and the same daily output (244 drums) of grapes is maintained throughout the entire period of 146 days. If there were any changes in either the number of farmers or their daily output, then the actual total number of drums of grapes collected would differ from this estimate.
Response:  We know that there are 235 farmers who can harvest 100 drums of raspberries and 221 drums of grapes per day. Since the farmer visited 77 days, we need to calculate how many drums of each fruit he would have collected during those days. Raspberry collection = (Number of farmers x Number of drums per farmer per day) x Number of days = 235 x 100 x 77 = 16,950 drums Grape collection = (Number of farmers x Number of drums per farmer per day) x Number of days = 235 x 221 x 77 = 18,437 drums Therefore, the total number of drums of both fruits collected by the farmer is 16,950 + 18,437 = 35,387 drums.
Response:  After he stopped checking his favorite grape field for 57 times, there are 252 people who harvested grapes every day. If they harvested 108 drums of grapes per day, then... (108 x 252 =)...the total number of drums of grapes harvested is 26,944 drums. Now, if it took 58 days to harvest all those grapes, then... (26,944 / 58 =)...the daily amount of grapes harvested is 463 drums.
Response:  If there are 36 people who collect drums of grapes in one day and each person can collect 8 drums per day, then we have: Number of days to collect 240 drums = Total number of drums collected / Number of people collecting drums per day 240 drums / 36 people/day = 6.94 days (approximately) So, it would take around 7 days for 36 people to collect 240 drums of grapes.
"Response:  We know that there are 26 water tanks and each tank has the same number of saltwater creatures. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of saltwater creatures = Total number of water tanks x Number of saltwater creatures per tank So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of saltwater creatures = 26 x?  Since all the water tanks have the same number of saltwater creatures, we can say that the number of saltwater creatures is equal to the total number of water tanks multiplied by the number of saltwater creatures per tank. Now, let's solve for ""?"" Substituting the value 52 (the total number of saltwater creatures) into the above equation, we get: 26 x 52 = 1320 So, there are 1320 saltwater creatures in total."
Response:  We know that the person has a total of 40 sea creatures and each tank contains 2 sea creatures. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of tanks = Total number of sea creatures / Number of sea creatures in each tank  Number of tanks = 40 / 2 = 20 tanks Therefore, the person has 20 tanks.
Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 water tanks for saltwater creatures and 10 water tanks for freshwater creatures. Each tank contains 39 creatures. So, in total, Tyler has 56 x 39 = 2174 creatures of saltwater species and 10 x 39 = 390 creatures of freshwater species. Therefore, Tyler has 2174 + 390 = 2564 creatures altogether.
Response: 彼 (Taylor) has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. Each aquarium contains 46 animals. So, in total, Taylor has 74 x 46 = 3380 animals of freshwater species and 22 x 46 = 952 animals of saltwater species. Therefore, Taylor has 3380 + 952 = 4332 animals altogether.
Response: 彼 (he) has 15 aquariums for sea water creatures and 62 aquariums for freshwater creatures. Each aquarium contains 19 animals. So, the total number of animals he owns is: 15 x 19 = 285 sea water creatures + 62 x 19 = 1140 freshwater creatures = 1425 animals Total number of animals = 1425
Response:  If we buy 13 pieces of white T-shirts in one package, then if the mother buys 39 pieces of white T-shirts, she will get how many packages?  We know that 13 / 1 = x, where x is the number of packages the mother gets. So, x = 39. Therefore, the mother gets 39 packages.
"Response:  If the mother bought 66 white T-shirts, and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then...

The number of packages = Number of white T-shirts / Number of T-shirts in each package
= 66 / 3
= 22
Therefore, the mother has 22 packages of white T-shirts."
Response:  If there are 56 white T-shirts in total and the mother bought 28 packages, then each package contains how many white T-shirts?  To find out, we can divide the total number of white T-shirts by the number of packages: 56 / 28 = 2 So, each package contains 2 white T-shirts.
"Response:  White T-shirts are sold in packages of 53 pieces, and pants are sold in packs of 34 pairs. If the mother bought both items together, then...
Answer:  The total number of white T-shirts that the mother has is 53 x 2 = 106. And the total number of pants she has is 34 x 2 = 68. Therefore, the mother has a total of 106 + 68 = 174 items."
"Response:  If she buys 51 white T-shirts, and each package contains 3 shirts, then...

$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $"
"Response:  Mother buys 70 white T-shirts in total. She buys 14 packages of them. So, we can say that each package contains:

Number of white T-shirts per package = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of packages
= 70 / 14
= 5

So, there are 5 white T-shirts in each package."
Response:  We know that there are 4 bags and each bag contains an equal number of cookies. So, if we have x cookies in total, then each bag must contain x/4 cookies. Since there are 36 cookies in total, we can write the equation: x = 36 / 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, each bag contains 9 cookies.
Response:  If there are 33 cookies in total and each bag contains 11 cookies, then we have: Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag = 33 / 11 = 3 bags So, the person has 3 bags of cookies.
Response:  If there are 41 cookies in one bag and the person has 53 bags of cookies, then the total number of cookies is:  Total number of cookies = Number of cookies in one bag x Number of bags = 41 x 53 = 2163 cookies.
Response:  We have 14 cookies in total and we want to divide them equally among 7 bags. So, we need to find out how many cookies each bag can hold. To do this, we divide the total number of cookies (14) by the number of bags (7): 14 / 7 = 2. Therefore, each bag will contain 2 cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 3 cookies in each bag and total number of bags is 21. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of bags = Total number of cookies / Number of cookies per bag  Number of bags = 21 / 3  Number of bags = 7  Therefore, there are 7 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 26 bags of cookies and 15 bags of candy in total. Since each bag contains an equal number of cookies or candies, we can assume that each bag has 26/15 = 1.73 bags of cookies (or candies). Therefore, there are 26 x 1.73 = 44 bags of cookies in total.
Response:  We have 14 bags of cookies that contain the same number of cookies each. So, we have 14 x 1 = 14 cookies in total. Now, we have 86 candies that are not included in the cookie bags. Therefore, the number of bags of cookies is equal to the number of candies divided by the number of cookies per bag. In this case, we have 86 / 14 = 6 bags of cookies.  So, there are 6 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that there are 5 junk mail pieces to be delivered to each block and we need to deliver 25 pieces of mail to each house in a block. So, if there are x houses in one block, then the total number of junk mail pieces to be delivered to all blocks is 5x. Since there are y blocks in total, the total number of junk mail pieces to be delivered is 5y. Therefore, the answer is 5y.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in each block and we need to deliver 9 junk mail pieces per house, then the total number of junk mail pieces needed for all blocks is:

20 x 9 = 180

So, we need to deliver 180 junk mail pieces in total."
Response:  Since there are 6 houses in one block and the mailman needs to deliver 24 junk mails overall, he will need to deliver 24/6 = 4 junk mails per house on average. So each house will receive 4 junk mails.
"Response:  If there are 14 junk mail pieces to be delivered to each household in one block, and the postman needs to deliver 2 junk mail pieces per block, then the number of blocks is:

14 x = 2

So, there are 7 blocks in total (since we can divide both sides of the equation by 2).

Now, let's find out how many households are in each block:

Number of households in each block = Total number of households / Number of blocks
= 7 x = 49 households/block

Therefore, there are 49 households in each block."
Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each block, and the mailman needs to deliver 32 pieces of junk mail to each house, we can calculate the total number of junk mail delivered as follows: Total number of junk mail = Number of blocks x Number of houses per block x Number of junk mails per house Total number of junk mail = 5 x 20 x 32 = 4000 junk mail Therefore, the mailman will need to deliver 4000 junk mail to all the houses in the city.
Response:  We have to deliver 30 junk mail pieces to each of the 78 blocks, which means we need to deliver a total of 2340 junk mail pieces (30 x 78 = 2340).
Response:  If there are 8 junk mails per block and the mailman has to deliver 32 packages in total, then each block will have 4 packages (32 / 8 = 4). So, there are 4 houses in each block.
Response:  Since there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, we need to deliver 81 x 12 = 972 junk mail pieces in total. So, the number of junk mail pieces that the postal worker needs to deliver to each block is 972 / 81 = 12.
Response:  Since there are 16 blocks and each block has 4 junk mail pieces to deliver, we need to calculate how many junk mail pieces will be delivered in total: 16 blocks x 4 pieces/block = 64 junk mail pieces Total number of junk mail pieces that must be delivered = 64 So, the answer is 64.
Response:  Since Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 stones, she can make 5 groups of eggs and 4 groups of stones. So, there will be 5 + 4 = 9 groups in total.
Response:  Rebecca has 10 beads and 15 eggs to distribute into groups of 5 each. We can start by dividing the beads first: Group 1: 3 beads (10 / 5 = 2) Group 2: 4 beads (10 - 3 = 7) Now, let's divide the eggs: Group 1: 3 eggs (15 / 5 = 3) Group 2: 2 eggs (15 - 3 = 12) So, there will be 2 groups of 5 each: {3 beads, 3 eggs} and {4 beads, 2 eggs}.
Response:  Since Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into 11 groups of 2 eggs each, she will have 11 x 2 = 22 eggs in total. So, Rebecca has 22 eggs.
Response:  Since Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into 4 groups, we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. We know that there are 8 eggs in total and 6 marbles. So, if we want to divide them equally among 4 groups, each group should have: Number of eggs = Total number of eggs / Number of groups = 8 / 4 = 2 eggs per group Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.
"Response: 
Rebecca has 4 balls and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. We can assume that each group will have an equal number of eggs. So, if Rebecca divides them equally, each group will have 5 eggs (since 15 / 3 = 5)."
Response:  Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into groups of 6 each. She has 18 eggs in total. So, she can make 18 / 6 = 3 groups. Now, let's count the bananas and mables together. There are 72 bananas and 66 marbles. Together they add up to 72 + 66 = 138. Since Rebecca cannot make more than one group with these numbers, there will be 138 / 6 = 22 groups. Therefore, Rebecca will create 3 groups of eggs and 22 groups of other items.
Response:  We know that Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into three groups. So, we need to find out how many eggs are in each group. There are 9 eggs in total. Now, let's see how many eggs each group can have based on the given numbers: Group 1: Bananas - 99 / 3 = 33 bananas left Group 2: Marbles - 27 / 3 = 9 marbles left Group 3: Eggs - 9 / 3 = 3 eggs left Therefore, the three groups will contain 33 bananas, 9 marbles, and 3 eggs.
Response:  Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. She wants to divide the eggs into 5 groups. To do this, she needs to distribute the eggs equally among the groups, so each group will have 4 eggs (20 / 5 = 4). Now, let's see how many marbles are left after dividing the eggs. There are 6 marbles initially, and after distributing the eggs, there are 6 - 4 = 2 marbles left. So, Rebecca has 2 more marbles than eggs. Therefore, Rebecca has 2 + 4 = 6 marbles more than eggs.
Response:  Rebecca has 5 balls and 12 eggs. She wants to divide them into groups of 20. So, we need to find out how many groups she can make with these resources. To do this, we will use division. Division is a way of dividing a quantity into equal parts or groups. In this case, we are dividing 20 groups among 5 balls and 12 eggs. We can start by dividing the balls first: 5 balls / 20 groups = 0.25 balls per group Now, let's see how many eggs are left over after dividing the balls: 12 eggs - (0.25 x 5 balls) = 9 eggs left over After diving the eggs, we have 9 eggs remaining that can be used to make additional groups if needed. Therefore, Rebecca has more than 20 eggs left over after dividing them into groups of 20. The exact number of eggs left over is 9.
Response:  Since Luke obtained 154 points in total and he got 11 points in one round, we can write this as: 154 = 11 + x Where 'x' is the number of rounds Luke played. Now, we know that Luke played at least one round since he obtained 11 points in that round. So, we can substitute 'x' = 1 in the equation above to get: 154 = 11 + 1 Therefore, Luke played 2 rounds.
Response:  If Luke played 177 rounds of Tribia Game and scored 46 points in the first round, then he must have scored a total of: $ \text {Total score} = \text{Number of rounds} \times \text{Points per round} $ $ \therefore \text{Total score} = 177 \times 46 = 8322 $ So, Luke scored 8322 points in the game.
"Response:  Since Luke obtained a total of 84 points after playing two rounds of Tribia Game, we can assume that he obtained x points in each round. Since there are two rounds, we have the equation: 
x + x = 84 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
2x = 84 
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 
x = 42 
Therefore, Luke obtained 42 points per round."
Response:  Luke obtained 146 points in each round of the game and played 157 rounds. Therefore, he obtained a total of: 146 x 157 = 21,320 points.
"Response:  If Luke obtained 3 points in each round of the game and he played 78 rounds, then...

1st Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 3
2nd Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 6 (3 + 3)
3rd Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 9 (6 + 3)
4th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 12 (9 + 3)
5th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 15 (12 + 3)
6th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 18 (15 + 3)
7th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 21 (18 + 3)
8th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 24 (21 + 3)
9th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 27 (24 + 3)
10th Round: Luke obtained 3 points → Total score = 30 (27 + 3)
...

As you can see, Luke played 78 rounds, so he obtained 78 x 3 = 234 points in total. Therefore, he played 234 rounds."

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Emily has 2 beads and wants to make 32 necklaces. Since each necklace requires one bead, we can conclude that she will need 32 beads in total to make all the necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 32."
"Response:  Emily made 11 necklaces and each necklace requires 28 beads. So, in total, Emily has used...................... beads to make all the necklaces. (Note: Here, we are using the word ""beads"" instead of ""bees"" as it is more appropriate for this context.)"
Response:  Emily has 16 beads and needs 8 beads for each necklace. So, she can make __________ necklaces. (Note: The blank space represents the number of times you can divide 16 by 8 to get a whole number.) In this case, Emily can make 20 necklaces.
Response:  Emily wants to make necklaces for her friends and she has only 6 beads in total. If she wants to make 18 necklaces, then each necklace will require how many beads? We can calculate this as follows: Number of beads required = Total number of beads / Number of necklaces needed To find out the number of beads required, we need to divide the total number of beads (6) by the number of necklaces Emily wants to make (18). So, the answer is: Number of beads required = 6 / 18 = 0.33 beads per necklace Since Emily has only 6 beads in total, she won't be able to make more than 18 necklaces with these beads.
Response:  Emily made 4 necklaces and each necklace requires 5 beads. So, she made a total of 4 x 5 = 20 beads. Therefore, Emily has 20 beads in total.
"Response:  Emily has 72 friends and wants to make necklaces for each of them using beads she has in stock. Each necklace requires 3 beads, so... See More
Emily has 72 friends and wants to make necklaces for each of them using beads she has in stock. Each necklace requires 3 beads, so the total number of beads needed is 72 x 3 = 216 beads. Since Emily only has 6 beads in total, it is not possible for her to make more than 216/6 = 35 necklaces. Therefore, the answer is 35."
Response:  Emily has 5 beads and wants to make 20 necklaces. Since she can make one necklace with each of the 5 beads, we have: Number of beads = 5. Number of necklaces = 20. To find out how many beads are needed for each necklace, we divide the number of necklaces by the number of beads: Number of beads per necklace = 20 / 5 = 4. So, each necklace requires 4 beads.
Response:  Emily made 44 necklaces for her friends and she made 26 of them. Each necklace requires two beads, so the total number of beads used is: Number of necklaces x Number of beads per necklace = 26 x 2 = 52 beads. Therefore, Emily has 52 beads in total.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children who went to camp from Lawrence County and 668278 children who stayed at home. So, we have: Number of children who went to camp = 819058 Number of children who stayed at home = 668278 Now, we need to find out how many more children went to camp than stayed at home. To do this, we can subtract the number of children who stayed at home from the number of children who went to camp: More children went to camp = Number of children who went to camp - Number of children who stayed at home Substituting the values given in the question, we get: More children went to camp = 819058 - 668278 = 150780 Therefore, there were 150780 more children who went to camp than stayed at home.
Response:  We know that from Lawrence County, 202,958 children went to camp and 777,622 children stayed at home. So, we have: Campers = 202,958 Home = 777,622 Now, we want to find out how many more children were at home than at camp. To do this, we subtract the number of campers from the number of home: More at home = Home - Campers = 777,622 - 202,958 = 574,664 Therefore, there are 574,664 more children who stayed at home than those who went to camp.
Response:  We know that there are 898,051 children in Lawrence County. Of these, 629,424 go to camp during summer vacation. This means that the number of children who stay at home is: 898,051 - 629,424 = 268,627 Therefore, there are 268,627 children who stay at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 313,473 children in Lawrence County. Of these, 274,865 children are at home during summer vacation. This means that 38,608 children (313,473 - 274,865) go to camp during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 907,611 children in Lawrence County during summer vacation and 455,682 of them go to camp. So, the number of children who stay at home is:  907,611 - 455,682 = 451,929  Therefore, there are approximately 451,929 children in Lawrence County who do not go to camp during summer vacation.
Response:  We know that out of 800059 children who went to camp, 74367 (or 93%) stayed at home. So, the number of children staying at home is equal to 74367. Now, we need to find out how many children are left in Lawrence County after subtracting those who went to camp. The total number of children in Lawrence County is given as 828521. Therefore, the remaining children after subtraction would be: Number of remaining children = Total number of children - Number of children who went to camp = 828521 - 74367 = 184954 So, approximately 185 thousand children stayed at home in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that out of 61619 children in Lawrence County, 3000 went to camp. So, the number of children who did not go to camp is:  61619 - 3000 = 58619. Now we want to find out approximately how many children from Lawrence County went to camp. To do this, we divide the number of children who went to camp by the total number of children in Lawrence County: 3000 / 58619 = 0.052 or about 5.2%. Therefore, approximately 5.2% of the children in Lawrence County went to camp.
Response:  Firstly, we know that from Lawrence County, 34044 children went to camp and another 134867 children stayed at home. So, in total, 47501 children were left behind in Lawrence County. Now, let's consider the number of children who came from outside Lawrence County. We are given that 424944 children participated in the camp from outside Lawrence County. Therefore, the total number of children who attended the camp is: Total number of children attending camp = Number of children from Lawrence County + Number of children from outside Lawrence County = 47501 + 424944 = 470345 children.
"Response:  We know that from Lawrence County, 610,769 children went to camp and 590,796 children stayed at home. So, we have:

Childrens who went to camp = 610,769
Children who stayed at home in Lawrence County = 590,796
Now, we are told that there were 22 children from outside Lawrence County who joined the camp. So, adding this number to the total number of children who went to camp gives us:

Total number of children who went to camp = 610,769 + 22 = 632,791
Therefore, approximately how many children are there in Lawrence County?
Answer:  To find out the approximate number of children in Lawrence County, we can divide the total number of children who went to camp by the number of children who stayed at home in Lawrence County:

Approximate number of children in Lawrence County = Total number of children who went to camp / Children who stayed at home in Lawrence County
= 632,791 / 590,796
= 1.08 million (approximately)"
Response:  Firstly, we know that from Lawrence County, there are 644,997 children who are at home during summer vacation. Then, we have to add the number of children who go to camp from Lawrence County and other counties outside Lawrence County. So, the total number of children who go to camp is 893,835 + 78 = 971,613 children. Now, we need to find out how many children are left in Lawrence County. Therefore, the number of children in Lawrence County is 644,997 - 971,613 = -326,616 children. However, this answer makes no sense as there cannot be negative numbers of children. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 children.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 7 apples. So, if Adam has more than Jackie, then Jackie must have fewer than 9 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 7 apples.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we need to subtract the number of apples Jackie has from the number of apples Adam has. So, the difference between Adam's apple count and Jackie's apple count is:  10 - 2 = 8 Therefore, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jackie has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has: Number of apples Jackie has - Number of apples Adam has = 10 - 9 = 1 So, Jackie has 1 more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jack has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jack has than Adam, we need to subtract the number of apples that Adam has from the number of apples that Jack has. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  10 - 8 = 2 Therefore, Jack has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  Adam and Jack have together 6 apples. If they have more than Adam alone has, then Jack must have at least 4 more apples than Adam. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jack has x + 4 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that both Adam and Jack have together is 6 = x + (x + 4). Solving for x, we get x = 2. So, Adam and Jack have altogether 3 apples each.
Response:  Adam and Jack have together 7 apples. If Adam has x apples and Jack has y apples, then the total number of apples they have is 7 = x + y. Since Adam has more than 9 apples, we know that x > 9. Moreover, since Jack has fewer apples than Adam, we can write y < x. Now we are given two inequalities: x > 9 and y < x. Can you solve for x?
Response:  Adam and Jack have together 12 apples. Since Jack has more than Adam, there are 9 apples in total that belong to Jack (including both of their shares). So, Adam has 8 apples out of those 9. Therefore, Adam has 8/9 = 0.89 or 89% of the total apples.
Response:  Adam has 4 more oranges than Jackie, and Jackie has 10 oranges in total. So, Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 oranges in total. Since Adam and Jackie together have 2 oranges, Adam must have 14 / 2 = 7 oranges left after they are combined. Therefore, Adam has 7 oranges.
Response:  Adam has more oranges than Jackie. So, Adam has 5 + x = 89 oranges, where x is the number of oranges that Jackie has. Since Jackie has 11 oranges, we can write the equation as follows:  5 + x = 89  x = 84 (Since 5 + x = 89) Therefore, Adam has 84 oranges.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 31 cookies. Today, she baked 270 more cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 301 cookies yesterday and today (270 + 31). Therefore, the number of cookies Helen baked until last night is 301.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 90 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 51 more lemon crisps and 484 more chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 90 + 51 + 484 = 625 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 527 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 86 more. So, in total, Helen has baked 527 + 86 = 613 chocolate chip cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 85 more lemon crinkle cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 229 cookies (144 + 85).
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 19 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 237 more chocolate chip cookies. So, in total, Helen has baked 256 (19 + 237) chocolate chip cookies. Now, let's compare this number with the number of lemon drops she baked. According to the question, Helen baked 231 lemon drops. Therefore, Helen baked more chocolate chip cookies than lemon drops. The difference between these two numbers is 45 (256 - 231). So, the answer is 45.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 66 more. So, the total number of chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen is:  197 + 66 = 263 cookies.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen made 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies. So, if we compare yesterday to today, Helen baked 239 more raisin cookies (280 - 300 = -20) and 241 more chocolate chip cookies (359 - 519 = -160). Therefore, Helen baked 239 + 241 = 470 fewer cookies than yesterday.
Response:  Ke...
Response:  Keely has 91 DS games and new friends have 88 games, so together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Then, old friends have 53 games, so the total number of games among all three groups is 179 + 53 = 232 games. Therefore, Keely's friends have altogether 232 games.
"Response: 
Katy has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So, together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games."
"Response: 
Katy has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19). 
Her friends have 8 new games and 69 old games, so they have a total of 77 games (8 + 69). 
Now, let's find out how many new games Katy and her friends together have:
New games = Katy's new games + Friends' new games = 103 + 77 = 180 new games."
Response:  According to Katy, she has 62 new games and 80 old games, so together she has 142 games (62 + 80 = 142).  Now, her friends have 73 new games and 41 old games, so together they have 114 games (73 + 41 = 114). Therefore, the total number of old games that both Katy and her friends possess is 142 - 114 = 28.
"Response: 
Katy has 57 games with her friends and she has 63 DS games. So, we can say that Katy has more DS games than the number of games she plays with her friends.  Therefore, the difference between the number of games Katy has and the number of games her friend has is equal to the number of DS games she has minus the number of games she plays with her friends.  
So, the answer is: 63 - 57 = 6."
"Response: 
Katy has 57 new games and her friends have 34 new games. So, Katy has more than her friends in terms of number of new games. To find out how many more, we need to subtract the number of new games that her friends have from the number of new games that Katy has.
So, the difference between the number of new games that Katy has (57) and the number of new games that her friends have (34) is:
57 - 34 = 23
Therefore, Katy has 23 more new games than her friends."
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $60 last week and then gave $21 to Jason. So, Fred has $39 left ($60 - $21). Then, Jason earned $33 from washing cars over the weekend. Therefore, the total amount of money that Jason earned is $33 + $39 = $72.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $86 last week and then he spent $10 to wash his car. So now he has $76. Jason had $5 last week and didn't work, so he still has $5. Therefore, their current total amount of money is: $76 + $5 = $81.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $19 last week and Jason had $16. Then they washed their car over the weekend, and now Fred has $40 and Jason has $69. So, Fred earned $21 ($40 - $19) more than he had last week. Therefore, Fred earned $21 during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $114 last week and then he spent $22 to wash his car. So, now he has $92 ($114 - $22). Then, Jason had $22 and he also spent some money to wash his car, so now he has $78 ($22 + x where x is the amount of money he spent). Now, we know that Fred has $92 and Jason has $78, so the difference between their amounts of money is $14 ($92 - $78). Therefore, Jason earned $14 more than Fred during the weekend.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $111 and Jason had $40 last week. Then, Fred earned $4 ($111 - $107) and Jason earned $6 ($40 + $2). So, their current amounts are: Fred has $115 ($107 + $8), and Jason has $46 ($40 + $6). Therefore, they earned a total of $159 ($115 + $46) during the week.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $49 last week and earned $73 from washing cars over the weekend, so he now has $112. Similarly, Jason had $3 last week and earned $58 from delivering newspapers, so he now has $61. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by both of them is $173 ($112 + $61).
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $78 last week and earned $90 this week after washing his car. So, his current amount is $90 + $78 = $168. Similarly, Jason had $31 last week and earned $14 from delivering newspapers, so his current amount is $31 + $14 = $45. Therefore, the total amount they earned from their respective activities is $168 (Fred) + $45 (Jason) = $213.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $33 last week and earned $16 from delivering newspapers and $74 from washing cars, so his total earnings for that week are: $33 + $16 + $74 = $123.
Response:  Firstly, Fred had $47 last week and then he earned $111 from delivering newspapers and $34 from washing cars. So, his total amount of money now is: $47 + $111 + $34 = $282.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie started jogging every day and lost 20 kilograms (kg) in weight. So, her initial weight was 71 kg + 20 kg = 91 kg. Now, she has lost 20 kg, so her current weight is 91 kg - 20 kg = 71 kg. Therefore, Jessie currently weighs 71 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie has lost 101 kg since she started jogging. So, her current weight is 27 kg - 101 kg = -74 kg. However, this answer is negative because it means that Jessie has lost weight. Therefore, her pre-jogging weight must have been positive, i.e., greater than zero. So, her pre-jogging weight was 74 kg + 27 kg = 91 kg.
Response:  We know that Jessie started jogging every day from Monday to Friday for 3 months (90 days). In total, she ran 357 kilometers during this period. Since she lost weight, her body fat percentage decreased, and her muscle mass increased. So, we can assume that some of the weight she lost is due to muscle gain rather than pure fat loss.  To calculate Jessie's original weight before starting jogging, we need to use the formula: Original weight = Current weight / (Body fat percentage x 100) Now, let's estimate Jessie's current body fat percentage based on her weight loss. According to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), a safe rate of weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. Given that Jessie lost 126 kilograms in 90 days, which is equivalent to 1.44 kilograms per week, her body fat percentage must have been relatively low initially. Assuming an initial body fat percentage of around 25%, we can calculate Jessie's original weight as follows: Original weight = Current weight / (Body fat percentage x 100) = 66 kg / (25% x 100) = 168 kg Therefore, Jessie's original weight before starting jogging was approximately 168 kilograms or 370 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jessie started jogging every day from a weight of 69 kg (152 lbs). Then, she lost 35 kg (77 lbs) in total through her daily jogging habit. Therefore, her current weight can be calculated as follows:  Current Weight = Original Weight - Total Loss Total Loss = 35 kg (77 lbs) Original Weight = 69 kg (152 lbs) So, Jessie's current weight is approximately 34 kg (75 lbs).
Response:  First week (50 kg), second week (60 kg) = total weight lost in two weeks = 110 kg. So, Jessee's current weight is 110 - 114 = -3 kg.
Response:  First week (Week 1): Jessie jogged for 62 kg in total. Since she started at 9 kg, her weight loss per day is: 62 / 7 = 9 kg/day Second week (Week 2): In Week 2, Jessie lost an additional 58 kg, bringing her total weight loss to 140 kg. So, her daily weight loss during this week is: 140 / 7 = 20 kg/day Now, let's find out what was her initial body weight before starting jogging: We know that after two weeks of jogging, she lost a total of 140 kg. If she started with 9 kg, then her initial body weight must have been: 9 + 140 = 150 kg Therefore, Jessie's initial body weight before starting jogging was 150 kg.
Response:  First week (Week 1): Jessie jogged for 5 days and lost 56 kg weight. So her weight after Week 1 is: 92 kg - 56 kg = 36 kg.  Second week (Week 2): Jessie continued to jog for another 5 days and lost an additional 43 kg weight. So her weight after Week 2 is: 36 kg + (-43 kg) = 13 kg. Therefore, Jessie's weight one week after starting jogging is 13 kg.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in the enclosure and 61 alligators. If 64 of them were hidden, then we can find out how many snakes are not hidden as follows: Number of non-hidden snakes = Total number of snakes - Number of hidden snakes Non-hidden snakes = 95 - 64 = 31 So, there are 31 snakes that are not hidden in the enclosure.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 winners in the zoo enclosure. If 40 of them are hidden, then we have to subtract 40 from both numbers. So, the number of visible snakes is: 93 - 40 = 53 And the number of visible winners is: 97 - 40 = 57 Now, let's calculate the total number of winners including those who are hiding: Total number of winners = Number of visible winners + Number of hidden winners = 57 + 40 = 97 Therefore, there are 97 winners in the zoo enclosure, including both visible and hidden ones.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 alligators in one cage. If we add 82 snakes and 19 alligators to the same cage, then the total number of alligators will be: 75 + (82 - 3) = 75 + 79 = 154 alligators. So, the number of hidden alligators is 154 - 75 = 79 alligators.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the enclosure. If 24 snakes and 51 crocodiles are hiding, then we have: Total number of hidden animals = Number of snakes x Number of crocodiles (hiding) = 24 x 51 = 1200 animals. So, the remaining 79 - 1200 = 639 animals are not hiding.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer picked 134 tomatoes from his garden, leaving him with 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes. Today, he picked 30 more tomatoes, so now he has 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer picked 56 tomatoes from his garden, leaving him with 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes. Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday, the farmer had 90 tomatoes and picked 154 of them, so he has 69 tomatoes left (90 - 154 = 69). Today, he picked 50 more tomatoes, so he now has 119 tomatoes in total (69 + 50 = 119). Therefore, the farmer picked a total of 173 tomatoes (119 + 50 = 173).
Response:  The farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he harvests 172 potatoes, then the number of remaining potatoes is: 77 - 172 = -95 potatoes. Since there are no negative numbers of tomatoes, we can conclude that the number of remaining tomatoes is 175 - (-95) = 80 tomatoes. Therefore, the number of remaining tomatoes is 80, and the number of remaining potatoes is -95.
"Response:  The farmer has 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes initially. If he takes 53 tomatoes, then we have:

Tomatoes left = 177 - 53 = 124
Potatoes left = 12
So, there are 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left after the farmer takes 53 tomatoes."
Response:  The farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes in his garden. If he picks up 137 tomatoes altogether, then the number of remaining tomatoes is:  Number of green tomatoes = 105 - 137 = -32 Number of red tomatoes = 71 - 137 = -66 Therefore, there are -32 green tomatoes and -66 red tomatoes left in the garden after the farmer picked up 137 tomatoes.
Response:  Since John needs to use 4 total nails and each wood piece requires 2 nails, he will need 4/2 = 2 pieces of wood. Therefore, John needs 2 pieces of wood for his wall.
Response:  For the large wood pieces, John needs 13 x 17 = 209 nails.  For the small wood pieces, he needs 8 x (number of small wood pieces) = 8 x (number of small wood pieces). So in total, John needs 209 + 8(number of small wood pieces) = 209 + (8 x number of small wood pieces) nails.
Response:  We know that John used a total of 11 bolts to fix the large wooden planks onto the wall. Each plank requires 3 bolts, so we can calculate the number of planks as follows: Number of planks = Total number of bolts / Number of bolts per plank = 11 / 3 = 3  So, there are 3 large wooden planks fixed onto the wall using the given bolts.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of planks that John needs to fix the wall with big planks. Since there are 12 big planks and each requires 15 nails for fixing, the total number of nails needed is: 12 x 15 = 180 nails. Now, let's move on to small planks. There are 10 small planks, and each requires 5 nails for fixing. Therefore, the total number of nails needed for small planks is: 10 x 5 = 50 nails. So, in total, John needs 180 + 50 = 230 nails to fix the wall.
Response:  John is using 16 wooden boards to cover his house wall. Each board requires 2 nails. Therefore, the total number of nails required = Number of boards x Number of nails per board = 16 x 2 = 32 nails. So, John needs 32 nails to secure all the wooden boards onto the house wall.
Response:  We know that there are 8 large wooden planks needed for the wall of the house. Each plank requires 74 nails. So, in total, we need 74 x 8 = 592 nails to attach all the planks to the wall. Therefore, John needs 592 nails to complete the task.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John needs to use 12 large planks and 17 small planks for the wall of his house.  Secondly, each large plank requires 14 nails, while each small plank requires 25 nails. So, in total, John needs 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the large planks and 17 x 25 = 425 nails for the small planks. Therefore, the total number of nails required is 168 + 425 = 593 nails.
Response:  We know that Robbin has 42 pieces of gum in total and each package contains 3 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = Total number of gum / Number of gum per package Therefore, we can plug in the values given in the question to get: Number of packages = 42 / 3 = 14 packages So, Robbin has 14 packages of gum.
Response: 1. Robbin has 43 packages of gum. (Given) 2. Each package contains 23 pieces of gum. (Given) 3. Robbin has 8 extra pieces of gum. (Given)  Now we need to find out how many total pieces of gum Robbin has. Total = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package + Number of extra pieces So, Total = 43 x 23 + 8 = 970 pieces of gum. Therefore, Robbin has 970 pieces of gum in total.
Response:  Robin has 3 packages of gum with 7 pieces in each package, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 pieces of gum. Since he has 6 extra pieces of gum, the total number of pieces of gum that Robin has is 21 + 6 = 27 pieces of gum. Therefore, Robin has 3 packages of gum.
"Response: 
Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 4 pieces. So, Robin has a total of 28 x 4 = 112 pieces of gum.  
Now, let's move to candy. Robin has 13 packages of candy and each package contains 4 pieces. So, Robin has a total of 13 x 4 = 52 pieces of candy.  Therefore, Robin has a total of 112 + 52 = 164 pieces of both gum and candy."
"Response: 
Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 candies. So, Robin has a total of:
21 x 9 = 189 candies
Therefore, Robin has 189 candies in total."
"Response: 
Robin has 28 packages of gum and each package contains 6 pieces, so Robin has 28 x 6 = 168 pieces of gum. 
He also has 14 packages of candy and each package contains 6 pieces, so he has 14 x 6 = 84 pieces of candy.  Therefore, Robin has a total of 168 + 84 = 252 pieces of candy."
Response:  If the machine can produce 3 shirts per minute and it produced a total of 6 shirts, then we can calculate the time taken to make those 6 shirts as follows: Time = Number of shirts / Rate at which shirts are made per minute Time = 6 / 3 = 2 minutes Therefore, the machine was in operation for 2 minutes.
Response:  If the industrial machine can produce 4 shirts in 1 minute, then it means that it produces 4 x 60 = 240 shirts per hour. Since the machine operates for 5 minutes, it will produce 240 x 5 = 1200 shirts altogether. Therefore, the answer is 1200 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 9 minutes. Today, the machine made 44 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 44/60 = 72 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 72 minutes yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts in 1 hour, so it worked for 13/1 = 13 hours. Today, it made 3 shirts in 1 hour, so it worked for 3/1 = 3 hours. Therefore, the total time the machine worked is 13 + 3 = 16 hours.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 9 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 9 minutes. Today, it made 8 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 8 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for a total of 17 minutes today (9 + 8 = 17).
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 4 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 4 minutes. Today, the machine produced 8 shirts in 1 minute, so it worked for 8 minutes. Therefore, the total time the machine was in operation is: 4 + 8 = 12 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine produced 6 shirts per minute, and it worked for 12 minutes. So, the total number of shirts produced yesterday is: 6 x 12 = 72 shirts. Today, the machine produced 14 shirts in 14 minutes. Therefore, the total number of shirts produced today is: 6 x 14 = 84 shirts. In conclusion, the machine has produced a total of: 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 5 minutes and today it worked for 12 minutes, so the total time worked is: 5 + 12 = 17 minutes. Since the machine can produce 6 shirts per minute, the number of shirts produced today is: 17 minutes / 6 shirts/minute = 28 shirts. Therefore, the machine produced 28 shirts today.
Response:  The Carnival ring toss game earned $165 in 5 days. To find out how much it earned per day, we can divide the total amount by the number of days: $165 / 5 = $33 per day.
Response:  The Carnival ring toss game earned $144 per day. If they were there for 22 days, their total earnings would be: $144 x 22 = $3,088 So, the correct answer is $3,088.
Response:  We know that Carnival earned $420 in 30 days, and including the game, they earned $22 in total. So, to find out how much Carnival earned per day from the ring toss game, we can divide the total amount earned ($22) by the number of days (30): $$ \therefore \frac {22} {30} = x $$ Now, we have a simple equation where x is the amount Carnival earned per day from the ring toss game: $$x = \frac {22} {30} $$ Solution: The amount Carnival earned per day from the ring toss game is $7.67 ($22 / 30).

Response:  The Carnival made $120 in the first 20 days and then $66 in the remaining 16 days for a total of $186. So, if we divide the total amount earned by the number of days, we get: Total income = $186 Day...
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carnival made $325 in revenue during the first 154 days of its ring toss game. Then, it made an additional $114 in revenue during the remaining 57 days. To find out how much Carnival made per day during the last 57 days, we can divide the total amount of money earned ($114) by the number of days left (57). Therefore, Carnival made $2 per day during the last 57 days of its ring toss game.
Response: ルーシー (Rucy) bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes. So, the total number of packages Rucy bought is: 10 + 4 = 14 packages. Therefore, Rucy bought more than 4 packs of cookies compared to cakes. The difference between the number of packages of cookies and cakes is 14 - 4 = 10 packages.
"Response: 
Lucy went to the grocery store and bought 4 packs of cookies (so 4 x 8 = 32 cookies). Then she bought 22 packs of cake (so 22 x 8 = 176 cakes). Finally, she bought 16 packs of chocolate (so 16 x 8 = 128 chocolates). In total, Lucy bought 32 + 176 + 128 = 436 packages of food at the grocery store."
Response: ルーシー (Rucy) bought 23 packs of cookies and some cakes. Since she also bought some cake packages, let's assume she bought x cake packages. Then, we know that Rucy bought a total of 23 + x packs of food. Therefore, the number of cake packages Rucy bought is x = 27 - 23 = 4. So, Rucy bought 4 cake packages.
"Response: 
Firstly, Ruxi bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. So, she purchased a total of 2 + 12 = 14 packages of food items. Therefore, there are 14 x 56 = 792 units of food left after Ruxi finished shopping."
Response:  At first, there were 12 passengers in total. Then, 4 of them got off at the next stop, leaving 8 passengers remaining on the bus. Since each bus can accommodate more than 36 people, we know that the number of passengers on the bus is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus now is between 8 and 36, inclusive. So, the answer is (8, 36].
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the bus. Then, 12 more people got on the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Finally, 3 people got off the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people still in the bus. Therefore, there are 17 people currently in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were only 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus, making it 13 people in total. So, the current number of people in the bus is 13.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train station. Then, 8 people got on the train, leaving 3 people behind. So, currently, there are 8 + 3 = 11 people in the train.
Response:  We know that there are 22 program mentors and 676 students in total. So, each mentor is responsible for 30 students (676 / 22 = 30). Therefore, there are 30 students per mentor.
Response:  Parent: 73 x 1 = 73 People Student: 724 x 1 = 724 People Teacher: 744 x 1 = 744 People Total number of people in the program: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531 people
Response:  We know that there are 174 parents and 521 students in total. To find out how many more students than parents there are, we need to subtract the number of parents from the number of students: 521 - 174 = 347 So, there are 347 more students than parents in this program.
Response:  We know that there are 61 parents and 177 students in the program. Since each seat has space for 4 people (parents + students), we can calculate the total number of seats as follows: Number of seats = Total number of participants x Number of people per seat = 61 + 177 = 238 seats Now, let's divide the total number of participants by the number of seats to find out how many people participated in the program: Participants / Seats = 238 / 44 = 5.5 people per seat So, approximately 5.5 people participated in the program for every available seat.
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 919 feet and they need to move 1307 feet away from the entrance. To find out how far they will be from the entrance after moving 1307 feet, we can use the following calculation: Distance = Depth of Cave - Distance moved (in feet) In this case, the distance would be: Distance = 919 - 1307 = -488 feet So, after moving 1307 feet away from the entrance, they will be 488 feet closer to the exit than they were at the entrance.
"Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and they have already traveled 849 feet into it. If they are moving at a rate of 17 feet per minute, then we can calculate how far they will be in the cave after a certain amount of time. To do this, we need to convert their speed from feet per minute to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

17 ft/min = 17 x 60 = 1020 ft/h

Now, let's find out how far they will be in the cave after a certain number of hours. For example, if they have been moving for 3 hours, then they will have traveled:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 1020 ft/h x 3 h
= 3060 ft

So, after 3 hours, they will be 3060 feet deeper into the cave than they were when they started. To find out how many feet further they will be after additional hours, we can simply repeat this calculation:

Distance = Speed x Time

For example, if they continue moving at the same rate for another 5 hours, they will travel:

Distance = 1020 ft/h x 5 h
= 5100 ft

Therefore, after 8 hours (3 + 5), they will be 8160 feet deep into the cave."
Response:  If they are already at 659 feet and need to reach the end of the cave which is 762 feet deep, then we can calculate the distance left to cover as follows: Distance = End point - Current position = 762 - 659 = 133 feet So, they have to advance 133 feet further to reach the end of the cave.
Response:  Wildcat (野良猫) eats goldfish in the pond (池). Initially, there were 8 goldfish in the pond (パイジは最初に池で8匹の金魚を育てていました). After wildcat eats some of them, how many goldfish are left in the pond? We know that wildcat can eat 6 goldfish at most (野良猫が池の金魚を食べるのが好きで、6匹の金魚が残りました). So, if we subtract 6 from 8, we get 2 goldfish remaining in the pond (6匹の金魚が残りました). Therefore, 2 goldfish remain in the pond after wildcat eats some of them.
Response:  At first, Page had 7 goldfish and 12 carp in the pond. Then, wild cats came and ate some of them. Now, there are only 15 fish left in the pond. So, we can conclude that 7 + 12 = 19 fish were eaten by the wild cats. Therefore, 19 - 15 = 4 fish remained in the pond after the wild cats ate some of them.
Response:  At first, Page had 16 goldfish and 71 carp in the pond. If wild cats were eating them, then we can assume that each day, half of the fish would be eaten (since cats are not picky eaters). So, after one day, 8 goldfish (half of 16) and 35 carp (half of 71) would be left. After two days, 4 goldfish (half of 8) and 16 carp (half of 35) would be left. And so on... Now, let's calculate how many days it took for all the fish to be eaten: Day 1: 8 goldfish + 35 carp = 43 total fish remaining Day 2: 4 goldfish + 16 carp = 19 total fish remaining Day 3: 2 goldfish + 8 carp = 10 total fish remaining Day 4: 1 goldfish + 4 carp = 3 total fish remaining Day 5: 0 goldfish + 0 carp = 0 total fish remaining Therefore, it took 5 days for all the fish to be eaten. So, there are currently 0 goldfish and 0 carp left in the pond.
Response:  We know that Page has 15 goldfish in total and that 5 of them were eaten by the wild cat. So, the number of remaining goldfish is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left after the wild cat ate 5 of them.
Response:  The chef had initially 43 apples and made 2 pies using 16 apples each. So, he has 43 - 16 = 27 apples left. Now, he gave 2 apples to his friend as a gift, so he has 27 - 2 = 25 apples left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the chef had 58 l...
Response:  Shēfu (Chef) had 40 apples and made pies using 39 of them. So, he has 1 apple left. Therefore, the chef used 40 - 39 = 1 apple to make the pies.
Response:  Adam has 4 shelves and each shelf can hold 11 action figures. Therefore, the total number of shelves is 4 x 11 = 44 shelves. Since there are 40 cabinets in his room, each cabinet can hold 44/40 = 1.1 action figures per cabinet. So, the total number of action figures that Adam can store in his room is 1.1 x 40 = 44 action figures.
Response:  Adam can store 10 action figures in his room, and each shelf has space for 8 action figures. Therefore, there are 2 shelves (10 / 8 = 2) that Adam can use to store his action figures. So, there are 2 shelves in total.
Response:  Adam has 8 action figures and 10 cabbage...
Response:  We have 1 garden with 544 pots and each pot contains 32 flowers. Therefore, we have in total...
Response:  We have 466 pots and each pot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. So, in total we have: Number of flowers = 466 x 53 = 24,078 flowers Number of sticks = 466 x 181 = 85,966 sticks Therefore, there are 24,078 + 85,966 = 109,044 pieces in total.
Response:  We have 141 containers (鉢). Each container has either 71 flowers or 91 sticks. So, in total, we have: 71 x 141 = 9511 flowers + 91 x 141 = 12611 sticks. Therefore, there are 9511 flowers and 12611 sticks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 40 flowers in each pot and total number of pots is 10. So, total number of flowers = Number of pots x Number of flowers in each pot = 10 x 40 = 400. Therefore, there are 400 pots of flowers.
"Response:  We know that Steeven has 4502 Skittles and 4276 rubbers. If we divide them into groups of 154 each, then... (read more)

Solution: The size of each group is 4502 / 154 = 29.38 Skittles per group."
Response:  We know that Steeven has 3941 stickers in his collection and 4950 erasers. Since each group of erasers consists of 495 erasers, we can calculate the number of groups as follows: Number of groups = Total number of erasers / Number of erasers per group = 4950 / 495 = 10 So, there are 10 groups of erasers.
Response:  We know that there are 896 skittles in Steeven's collection and he also has 517 erasers and 90 hats. If we divide these items into groups of 8, then each group will have how many items?  To find out, let's use multiplication! The number of items in each group is equal to the total number of items divided by 8. So, if we divide 896 by 8, we get 112 as the number of Skittles in each group. Similarly, if we divide 517 by 8, we get 64 as the number of Erasers in each group, and if we divide 90 by 8, we get 11 as the number of Hats in each group.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students in total and each year has 5 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of students per year x Number of years 270 = 5x (Number of years) Now, we need to find out how many years it is. Since the number of students in each year is same, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in one year: 270 / 5 = X Where X is the unknown number of years. Therefore, the answer is X = 54 years.
Response:  School has 304 grades and each grade has 75 students. So, total number of students in school is: 304 x 75 = 22,550 students.
