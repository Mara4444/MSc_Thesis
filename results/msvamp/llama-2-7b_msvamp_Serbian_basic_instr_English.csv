"Response: 30
Explanation:
The first paragraph has 48 pages, and the second paragraph has 11 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the first paragraph is 48 + 11 = 59 pages. Since there are two chapters, the total number of pages in the book is twice 59 = 118 pages. So, the first chapter has more pages than the second chapter by 118 - 11 = 107 pages."
"Response: 43
Explanation: According to the question, the first chapter is 37 pages long and the second chapter is 80 pages long. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we can subtract the length of the first chapter from the length of the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter."
"Response: 53

Explanation:
Let's assume that the total number of pages in the book is x. Since the first chapter has 60 pages, we can write:
x = 60 + (93 - 60) = 153
Therefore, there are 53 pages in the second chapter."

Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The book has 3 chapters.
* The first chapter is 66 pages long.
* The second chapter is 35 pages long.
* The third chapter is 24 pages long.

To find out how many pages are in the entire book, we can add up the number of pages in each chapter and multiply by 3:

66 + 35 + 24 = 125

So, the book has 125 pages in total."

So, the first paragraph has 68 more pages than the second paragraph."
"Response: 20

Explanation:
The first chapter is 35 pages long, and the second chapter is 18 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages in the two chapters is:
35 + 18 = 53 pages.
Since the third chapter is only 3 pages long, we can conclude that there are 53 - 3 = 49 pages between the second and third chapters."
"Response: 40

Explanation:
Let's call the number of pages in each chapter x, y and z respectively. Since we know that the first chapter is 53 pages long, so x = 53. Similarly, since the third chapter is 21 pages long, so z = 21. Now, we can find the difference between the number of pages in the first and third chapters by subtracting their values:

z - x = 21 - 53 = -32

Therefore, there are 32 fewer pages in the first chapter than in the third chapter."

Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug before they played games together. If Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, that means Doug had 14 marbles initially (since Ed's initial advantage was 2). So, Doug lost 5 marbles during the game with Ed."
"Response: 46
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug. If Ed had 45 marbles and Doug lost 11 marbles on the playground, then Ed must have had 56 marbles (45 + 11). Therefore, the answer is 46."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug when they started playing. So, if Ed had 22 marbles and Doug had 16 (the number of marbles that Doug lost), then Ed must have had 22 + 6 = 28 marbles at one point in time."
"Response: 21
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug when they started playing. So, if Ed had 27 marbles and Doug had 24 (the number of marbles he had at the start), then Ed must have had 3 + 5 = 8 more marbles than Doug initially. Therefore, the correct answer is 21."
"Response: 31

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Ed had more than Doug (Dag) at first. Specifically, Ed had 24 more cups than Doug. Then, Doug lost 27 of his cups on the playground while Ed found 9 more cups. So, if Ed initially had x cups and Doug had y cups, then after Doug's loss, Ed would have x + 9 = 31 cups, and Doug would have y - 27 = 0 cups. Therefore, Ed has 31 cups more than Doug."

"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. If Ed lost 21 of his marbles on the playground, he would have 89 marbles left (30 + 21 = 89). Since Doug had fewer marbles than Ed before Ed lost any, Doug must have had 45 marbles."
"Response: 19
Explanation: According to the question, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug before losing any marbles. So, if Ed had 17 marbles after losing some, then he must have had 39 marbles (12 + 27) initially. Since Doug had 20 fewer marbles than Ed, Doug had 39 - 20 = 19 marbles initially."

Response: 30 inches. Explanation: According to the question, the snake (скакал) jumped 25 inches, and then the frog (жаба) jumped 18 inches further than that, so the total distance traveled by the frog is 25 + 18 = 43 inches. Finally, the mouse (мише) jumped 2 inches further than the frog, so it traveled a total of 43 + 2 = 45 inches. Therefore, the answer is 45 inches.
Response: 30 inches. Explanation: According to the question, the snake jumped 19 inches and then the frog jumped 10 inches further than the snake. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the frog is 19 + 10 = 29 inches.

Response: 22 inches. Explanation: According to the question, the frog jumped 39 inches and the snake only 17 inches. Therefore, the distance between the snake and the frog is 39 - 17 = 22 inches.
"Response: 30 cm
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the distance traveled by the frog (жаба) is 20 centimeters more than the distance traveled by the snake (скакал). The distance traveled by the mouse (мишеви) is 10 centimeters less than the distance traveled by the frog. Therefore, the distance traveled by the mouse can be calculated as follows: Distance = 20 + (-10) = 30 centimeters."
Response: 20 inches. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the snake (скакал) jumped 14 inches, and the mouse (мишеви) jumped 16 inches less than the frog (жаба). Therefore, the distance that the frog jumped is 37 - 16 = 21 inches. Since the snake jumped 14 inches, the total distance that the frog and the snake traveled after the frog's jump is 21 + 14 = 35 inches.

"Response: 5
Explanation:
The initial number of customers was 13, and some left, leaving the kelner with 4 new customers. To find out how many customers the kelner has left, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the total number of customers he had initially.

Question:  Пол је имао 115 књига. Продао је 78 књига на гаражној распродаји. Колико књига је остало са њим?  
Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 37"
"Response: 29

Explanation:
The statement ""Након продаje 137 у gaражноj rasprodaљи ostalo mu je 105"" means that after selling 137 books in a garage sale, he had 105 left. To find out how many books he had at the beginning, we can use the fact that the number of books he has after the garage sale is equal to the number of books he had at the beginning minus the number of books he sold. So, if he had x books at the beginning and sold 137, then the number of books he has left is x - 137 = 105. Solving for x, we get x = 29. Therefore, the man had 29 books at the beginning."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the passage, Poll had 108 books and sold some of them at a garage sale. After selling those books, he was left with 62 books. If he sold 40 books at the garage sale, then he has 62 - 40 = 22 books remaining."
"Response: 35

Explanation:
The statement ""Након што је купио неке на гаражној распродаји"" means that he bought some books at a garage sale after buying 50 books initially. So, the number of books he originally had is 50 - 35 = 15. Therefore, he bought 35 books at the garage sale."
"Response: 32

Explanation:
The problem states that Pol had 2 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. After selling those books, he bought 150 new ones. To find out how many books Pol sold, we need to subtract the number of books he had after the garage sale from the total number of books he had at first. In this case, Pol had 58 books left after selling some in the garage sale, so he sold 32 books (58 - 2 = 32)."
"Response: 7
Explanation: According to the passage, Pol had 21 books initially and sold some of them in a garage sale. After the sale, he bought 42 new books, which means he has 42 - 21 = 21 new books. Therefore, he has 15 + 21 = 36 books in total, including both the ones he originally had and the new ones he bought."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the passage, Pol had 71 books before selling some and then buying 38 new ones. Therefore, he now has 71 + 38 = 109 books. Since he sold some books, he must have bought more than he sold, so the difference between the number of books he bought and the number he sold is 45 (109 - 64)."
"Response: 32

Explanation:
The statement ""Након што је продао неке књиге и оловке у гаражној распродаји"" means that he sold some books and pens at a garage sale afterward. Therefore, the number of books he had left is equal to the original number minus the number sold at the garage sale.

From the problem, we know that Pol had initially 108 books and 55 olovki (pens). If he sold some books and pens at a garage sale, then the number of books he had left is given by:

Number of books left = Initial number of books - Number of books sold at garage sale
= 108 -?

We are also given that he had 66 books and 59 olovki (pens) left after selling some books and pens at the garage sale. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

66 + 59 = 108

Solving for the missing value, we get:

Number of books sold at garage sale = 42

Therefore, Pol sold 42 books at the garage sale."
Response: 7 olovki.
"Response: 59

Explanation:
The statement ""Пол је продао неке књиге на гаражној распродаји"" means that Paul sold some books at a garage sale. The phrase ""оставивши га са 27 књига"" means that after selling some books, he was left with 27 books. Therefore, the number of books Paul had initially is equal to the number of books he was left with (27).

So, if Paul had 136 books in the beginning, and he sold x books, then the number of books he was left with is 136 - x = 27.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 109

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."

Therefore, Dan found 40 more packages than capaques in the park."
"Response: 37
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Devi currently has 12 caps and 11 packages in his collection. He initially had 58 caps and 25 packages in the park. Therefore, he gained 43 caps (58 - 15) and 9 packages (25 - 16). So, Devi now has 37 more packages than caps in his collection."
"Response: 49
Explanation: According to the passage, Dan currently has 67 packages and 35 caps for bottles in his collection. The total number of items he has is 67 + 35 = 102.

Response: 5 (files)
"Response: 6

Explanation: According to the question, after Dave deleted some applications and files, he had 21 applications and 4 files remaining on his phone. This means that he initially had 15 applications and 24 files (a total of 39). Subtracting the number of applications and files he had after deleting some of them (21 + 4 = 25) gives us the final number of applications and files he had on his phone, which is 6 more applications than files."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 6 applications and 15 files left on his phone. To find out how many more files than applications he has left, we can subtract the number of applications from the total number of files: 15 (files) - 6 (applications) = 9. So, there are 9 more files than applications left on Dave's phone."

"Response: 8

Explanation: According to the question, Dave had 24 files and 13 applications on his phone before he deleted some apps and data. After deleting some apps and data, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files.

Therefore, Dave deleted 8 files (24 - 16 = 8)."
"Response: 3

Explanation: According to the question, after deleting some applications and files, Dave had 5 data files and 12 applications left on his phone. To find out how many more applications than data files he has, we need to subtract the number of data files from the total number of applications. In this case, 12 - 5 = 7, so there are 7 more applications than data files left on Dave's phone."
"Response: 5

Explanation:
From the information provided in the question, we know that Dave had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone before he brushed some of them away. Afterward, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. Therefore, the number of files (24) is greater than the number of applications (2), so the difference between the two is 22 files."

Explanation: According to the question, Nel had 301 baseball cards initially and gave 30 of them (30 x 30 = 900) to Jeff. So, Nel has 301 - 90 = 211 baseball cards left. Since the total number of cards is 200 + 154 = 354, we can conclude that Nel had 211 cards in the beginning."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the passage, Nel had 528 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now, there are 252 cards left with Nel, which means that Jeff must have received 36 cards from Nel (528 - 252 = 36)."
"Response: 234
Explanation: According to the passage, Nel had 566 baseball cards before giving some of them to Jeff. After giving some to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. Therefore, Jeff must have initially had 234 cards."
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the question, Nel had 309 baseball cards and gave some of them to Jeff. Now she has 415 baseball cards and 149 non-baseball cards. To find out how many more baseball cards Nel has than 10, we need to subtract 10 from her current total number of baseball cards. So, the answer is 27 (415 - 10)."
"Response: 378
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Nel had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card packs before giving some of her cards to Jeff. This means she had a total of 460 cards (246 + 214). After giving some cards to Jeff, Nel now has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card packs, which is a total of 909 cards (404 + 495). Therefore, the difference between the number of ten-card packs and baseball cards that Nel had before giving any cards to Jeff is 378 (909 - 460 = 378)."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Nel gave John 195 cards and several Jeffs (not just one) additional cards. Therefore, the total number of cards she gave away is 195 + (several) = 210. So, Nel gave Jeff 40 cards."
"Response: 26
Explanation: According to the question, Nel had 18 10-card sets and 438 baseball card sets. If she gave some of her cards to Jeff, then she has fewer cards than before. Let's assume that she gave him 10 cards from each set (since he got 10 cards from her). Then, she has 18 - 10 = 8 remaining 10-card sets, and 438 - 10 \* 8 = 26 remaining baseball card sets. Therefore, Nel has 26 more baseball cards than 10 cards."

"Response: 9
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 36 children in the bus, and then 68 children got off at the station. This means that 36 - 68 = -32 children got off the bus. Since some children entered the bus while others left, the total number of children in the bus afterward was 12 + (-32) = 40. Therefore, 40 - 12 = 28 more children entered the bus than got off it."
"Response: 38
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 22 children in the bus, and then 40 more children boarded the bus while some got off. Therefore, the total number of children who got off the bus is 40 - 22 = 18. So, the number of children who remained in the bus is 2 + 18 = 20."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, there were initially 28 children in the bus, and then 8 more got off at the station. Therefore, the total number of children who entered the bus is 28 + 8 = 36. So, 4 more children entered the bus than got off."

Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them. Therefore, the number of tarts that the baker has left is:

133 - 51 = 82

Since the baker has 82 tarts left, he must have made more than 82 tarts in total. So, the difference between the number of tarts the baker made and the number of tarts he sold is:

133 - 51 = 82

Therefore, the baker has 26 more tarts than he sold."
"Response: 13

Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 54 tarts and sold some of them. The number of tarts that the baker still has is equal to the number he sold minus the number he already gave away. Therefore, if he sold x torte, he must have still had 54 - x tortes left. Since he did not give any tortes away, we can conclude that x = 13, so the baker still has 13 tortes."
"Response: 30

Explanation:
The total number of kolačes made by the baker is given as 145 + 72 = 217. So, the baker has already sold 145 kolače and still has 72 left. Therefore, the number of kolače that the baker originally made is 217 - 145 = 72."

The pastry chef made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them, which means he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). He also bought 31 new tarts, so he now has 63 tarts in total (92 + 31 = 63). Therefore, the pastry chef sold more tarts than he bought by 31 - 42 = -11."
"Response: 94

Explanation:
The initial number of torte made by the baker is 110. The baker sold 75 of them, leaving him with 35 (110 - 75). Then he made another 76 colachs, bringing his total to 101 (35 + 76). Therefore, the baker still has 94 colachs left."
Response: 253 torte (144 + 111 = 253)
"Response: 36
Explanation: If the baker has already made 149 cookies and 91 pies, and he sells 10 tarts and 90 pies, then he will have 36 more collaches left."
Response: 269 peciva.
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 126 cookies and 48 pies. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 pies, then he has more tarts than pies. Therefore, the difference between the number of tarts and pies is 30 (115 - 81 = 34). So, there are 30 more tarts than pies made by the baker."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the question, Peka has made 19 torts and 131 pies. If he sold 70 colachs and 88 pies, then the number of pies he had is greater than the number of collations he sold by 57 (88 - 70). Therefore, there are 24 more pies than collations that Peka made."
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 157 torts and 169 pies. If he sold 158 torts and 147 pies, then there are more torts sold than pies sold. Therefore, the difference between the number of torts sold and the number of pies sold is 3 (158 - 147 = 3)."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 54 cookies and 143 pies. If he sold 68 cookies and 92 pies, then he sold a total of 68 + 92 = 160 pastries. Since the baker made 54 cookies, that means he has 160 - 54 = 106 left over. Therefore, the baker sold 106 pies."
Response: 36 torte.
Response: 40 - 8 = 32. Therefore, the baker made more than twice as many cookies as he sold.
"Response: 20

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:

Initial number of cookies = 169 (given)
Number of cookies bought from friend = 137 (given)
Total number of cookies with the new addition = Initial number of cookies + Number of cookies bought from friend

= 306

Therefore, the peasant still has 306 cookies after buying 137 from his friend."
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones. If he sold 86 tarts, that means he still has 103 - 86 = 17 tarts left."

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: 26"
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the baker made a total of 76 torte (62 + 149). He sold 144 of them, which means he still has 30 torte left with him."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 81 colač and then made another 92 tarts. If he sold 46 of them, that means he has 46 + 81 = 127 pastries left over. So, the baker has produced more colač than he has sold."
"Response: 39
Explanation: If the baker sold 108 cola and 44 pies, he would have 25 (108 - 44) colas left."
"Response: 32

Explanation:
The total number of pecies and colachs made by the baker is given as 56 + 124 = 180. Since he sold 104 colachs and 29 pecies, the number of pecies left with the baker is:

Number of pecies left with the baker = Total number of pecies - Number of pecies sold = 180 - 29 = 151
Therefore, the baker has 151 pecies left."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 52 pies and 84 cookies. If he sold 102 cookies and 94 pies, then there are more cookies than pies that the baker made. Therefore, the difference between the number of cookies and pies is equal to the number of cookies sold minus the number of pies sold, which is 36 (102 - 94)."
Response: 6 more peciva than colach.
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 14 torts and 153 pies. If he sold 8 pies and 97 colachaks, then he sold twice as many colachaks as he did pies. Therefore, the number of colachaks sold is 2 x 97 = 194. Since the total number of torsts and pies was 14 + 153 = 167, the number of colachaks sold is equal to the total number of torsts plus pies minus the number of pies sold, or 167 - 8 = 159."
"Response: 26

Explanation: According to the question, the baker made 43 cookies and 114 pies. If he sold 154 pies and 78 cookies, then he sold more pies than cookies. Therefore, the difference between the number of pies sold and the number of cookies sold is 78 - 43 = 35. So, the answer is 35."

Response: 360 - 91 = 269 games initially had by Kelly.
"Response: 5
Explanation: If Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games, that means she has a total of 90 games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to give away so that she will have 12 left, we can divide 90 by 20: 90 / 20 = 4.5. So, Kelly needs to give away 4.5 Nintendo games. Since you cannot give away a half game, Kelly needs to give away 5 Nintendo games in total."
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the question, Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sonic games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to sell in order to have 31 remaining, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has (132) from her total number of games (46 + 132 = 178). Dividing this result by 31 gives us 70 as the number of Sony games she must sell."

Response: 35 x 12 = 420 portocali
Response:  After 51 days of harvesting, each portokal will have approximately 36.89 tempora (tempora = 74/2). Therefore, after 51 days, each portokal will have approximately 36.89 tempora or 209.45 kg (since there are 74 tempora in one cubic meter).
"Response: 3200
Explanation:
According to the question, the portokali collect 76 baskets per day and discard 64 of them, which means they keep 12 baskets per day. Since each basket contains 50 portokali, the total number of portokali collected per day is 12 x 50 = 600. Therefore, the answer is 600."

Jar 2: 82 + (61 x 25) = 168 unzrelih portokala"
"Response:  After 45 days of harvesting, the number of unripe portulacas in each basket will be:
Unripe portulacas in each basket = Total unripe portulacas / Number of baskets
= 24/x
Where x is the total number of baskets at the beginning of the period (which is given as 31 + 24 = 55). Therefore, after 45 days, there will be:
Number of unripe portulacas in each basket = 24/55 = 0.44 or approximately 24 unripe portulacas per basket."
"Response: 39
Explanation: According to the passage, 44 vessels of ripe portulacas and 25 vessels of unripe portulacas are collected daily. Since there are more vessels of ripe portulacs than unripe ones, we can conclude that the number of vessels of ripe portulacs is greater than the number of vessels of unripe portulacs by a margin of 19 (44 - 25). Therefore, the ratio of the number of vessels of ripe portulacs to the number of vessels of unripe portulacs is 39:25 or 7:5."
"Response: 369
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the number of non-ripe portulacas collected daily is 74 times more than the number of ripe portulacas collected daily, which means that for every 1 ripe portula collected, 74 non-ripe portulacas are collected. Therefore, the total number of non-ripe portulacas collected daily is 74 x 20 = 1480. Since there are also 5 ripe portulacas collected daily, the total number of portulacas collected daily is 1480 + 5 = 1525."

Therefore, after 6 days of harvesting, there will be 390 jars of unripe portulacas."
"Response: 374
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the number of bunches of fresh portulacca collected daily is 41 + 86 = 127 bunches. Since each bunch contains 40-50 nezreli portulacca, the total number of nezreli portulacca collected daily is 127 x 40-50 = 4940-5700 nezreli portulacca per day. Therefore, the number of bunches of zrezeli portulacca collected dailly is 127 - 4940/5700 = 374 bunches per day."
"Response: 31
Explanation: According to the passage, 71 times as many unripe portulacas are collected as ripe ones every day, which means that for every 1 ripe portulaca collected, 71 unripe portulacas are also collected. Therefore, the number of unripe portulacas collected is 31 times greater than the number of ripe portulacas collected."
Response: 30 feet. Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's room is 12 steps long and 11 steps wide. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, we can convert the lengths of the room into feet as follows: 12 steps x 12 inches/step = 144 inches 144 inches / 11 inches/step = 13 feet Therefore, Jessie's room is 13 feet longer than it is wide.
Response: 32 square feet
Response: 3 meters.
Response: 32 square meters. Explanation: According to the question, Jessie's room is 11 meters long and 15 meters wide, which means it has an area of 11 x 15 = 165 square meters. Since we already know that there are 16 square meters of carpet on the floor, we can calculate how much more carpet Jessie needs by subtracting the amount she already has from the total area of the room: 165 - 16 = 149 square meters. Therefore, Jessie needs 149 square meters of additional carpet to cover the entire floor of her room.
"Response: 36
Explanation:
The length of Jessie's room is 2 steps and its width is 12 steps. Since each step is equal to 4 square feet, we can calculate the area of the room as follows: Area = Length x Width = 2 x 12 = 24 square feet. Therefore, Jessie needs 36 planks (24 / 4 = 8) to cover the entire floor."
"Response: 14
Explanation: Since Jessie's room is 7 meters long and 7 meters wide, it has an area of 49 square meters (length x width). If there are 20 rooms in total, then the total area of all the rooms is 20 x 49 = 980 square meters. Therefore, each room has an area of 980 / 20 = 49 square meters."
Response: 12 meters.
Response: 25 square feet
Response: 5 meters. Explanation: If Jessie's room is 2 feet wider than it is long, and she needs 10 square meters to cover her room, then the width of her room is 2 feet = 0.6 meters. Therefore, the length of her room is 10 / 0.6 = 16.7 meters.
Response: 36 square feet. Explanation: Since Jessie has 18 square feet of carpet and her room is 4 feet wide and 20 feet long, she will need an additional 36 square feet of carpet to cover the entire floor (4 x 20 = 80 square feet - 18 square feet already covered).

Explanation: According to the question, Arkansas and Texas sold $230 worth of t-shirts during the game. If Magasin za majice Raizorbacks made $23 per t-shirt, then they sold $\boxed{15}$ t-shirts in total."
"Response: 20.9 dollars
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, the store sold 3 t-shirts during the game Arkansas vs Texas Tech, and the total amount of money earned was $51. Since each t-shirt costs $20.9 dollars, we can conclude that the price of each t-shirt is $20.9 dollars."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the passage, Raizorbacks made $87 per sold t-shirt and sold a total of 95 t-shirts during their games in Arkansas and Texas. If they sold 47 t-shirts during their game in Arkansas, then they earned $419 ($87 x 47) from those sales."
"Response: 73

Explanation:
If the store earned $106 per sold t-shirt and they sold 242 t-shirts in total during both games in Arkansas and Texas, then they earned:

$106 x 242 = $25,984

Since they sold 115 t-shirts in Arkansas, the number of t-shirts sold in Texas is:

242 - 115 = 127

Therefore, they sold 73 more t-shirts in Texas than in Arkansas."
"Response: 45
Explanation: According to the passage, Raizorbacks made $98 per sold t-shirt. If they sold 89 t-shirts during their game in Arkansas, then they earned $89 x $98 = $8,722 in revenue from those sales alone."
"Response: 40

Explanation:
The total amount of money earned from selling t-shirts during both games is $78 x 2 = $156. Since they sold 172 t-shirts in Arkansas and 186 t-shirts in Texas, the amount of money earned per t-shirt sale is:

$156 / (172 + 186) = $40
Therefore, if they sold 172 t-shirts during the game in Arkansas, they would have earned $40 x 172 = $6960 in total."
Response: 405 dollars.

Response: 358 dollars. Explanation: If the shop sold each t-shirt for $201 before the game and increased the price by 217% during the game, then they sold 14 t-shirts during the game, which means they earned a total of $201 x 14 = $2,850 + $217 (increase in price) = $3,067.
"Response: 30 dollars
Explanation: According to the question, Rezorsback made $60 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas game. If they sold each t-shirt for $10, then they sold 6 t-shirts in total. Therefore, the answer is $30."
Response:  $43
Response: 389 dollars.
Response: 392 dollars.
"Response: 56 dollars
Explanation:
To find out how much more expensive each t-shirt is than the average price of $210, we need to subtract the average price from the price of each t-shirt sold during the game.
For the first game, the price of each t-shirt was $240 - $210 = $30 more than the average price.
For the second game, the price of each t-shirt was $230 - $210 = $20 more than the average price.
Therefore, the total amount by which each t-shirt is more expensive than the average price is: ($30 + $20) = $50."
Response: 40 dollars more.
"Response: 50
Explanation: According to the question, there are 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50."
"Response: 6
Explanation: If there are two groups of tables with an equal number of chairs in each group, then there must be twice as many chairs as tables. Therefore, if there are 12 chairs in total, and 2 groups of tables, then each table has 6 chairs (12 / 2 = 6)."
Response: 3 sets of tables with 3 chairs each = 9 chairs in total.
Response: 13 x 11 = 143.
"Response: 3
Explanation: According to the question, there are 10 sets of tables with 6 chairs each, for a total of 60 chairs. If 11 people sit down, that means 5 people will not have a chair (since there are only 60 chairs available). Therefore, there will be 5 unoccupied chairs remaining."
Response:  There are 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs, so there are 12 x 14 = 168 chairs in total. Additionally, there are 6 more chairs than guests, which means there are 168 + 6 = 174 chairs for the guests.
Response: 5 more stools will be needed. Explanation: If there are already 4 sets of 3 stools each (for a total of 12 stools), and 14 people will be attending the party, then an additional 5 stools will be needed to accommodate all the guests.
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, there are 14 chairs for each pair of tables, which means that there are 28 chairs in total (14 x 2 = 28). Since there are 9 sets of tables, there should be at least 9 x 28 = 252 chairs in total. Therefore, there are more than 252 chairs, so the answer is 15."

Question: аko Луиз зарађује 1357 долара сваке недељи током 223 недеље season of harvest. How much will he earn if he works for 73 seasons of harvest?  Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.  Answer: $609485"
Response: 457 dollars.
"Response: 1657

Explanation:
To find out how much Luis has to pay in rent each week during the 233 weeks of harvest season, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works. Since he earns $403 per week and works for 233 weeks, his total income is:

$403 x 233 = $93,830

Now, we need to calculate the amount of rent he needs to pay based on this income. According to the question, Luis pays $49 in rent each week. To find out how many weeks he can afford to pay this amount, we divide his total income by the amount of rent he pays each week:

$93,830 / $49 = 190 weeks

Therefore, Luis can afford to pay $49 in rent each week for 190 weeks, which means he will have to pay a total of:

$49 x 190 = $9,383

So, the answer is $9,383."
"Response: 42000

Explanation:
To find out how much Luis pays in rent each week during the 1359 weeks of harvest season, we need to multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks he works. His weekly income is $368, so he pays $368 x 1359 = $476,772 in rent per year.

Since he has to pay $388 in housing expenses every week, we can calculate the total amount he pays in housing expenses over the course of the harvest season as follows:
$388 x 1359 = $519,778

Therefore, Luis pays a total of $476,772 + $519,778 = $996,550 in housing expenses over the course of the harvest season."
"Response: 30570

Explanation:
Let's assume that Luis works for 118 weeks (or 1181 days) during the growing season. If he earns $491 per week, his total income for the entire season would be:

$491 x 118 = $57,688

Now, let's calculate how much money Luis will have at the end of the season after paying $216 in housing costs each week:

$57,688 - ($216 x 118) = $30,570

Therefore, the answer is $30,570."
Response: 5.42 dollars per week
"Response: 50 weeks
Explanation: According to the question, Luis earns $2 per week during harvest time. To find out how many weeks he worked during harvest time, we need to divide the total amount of money he earned ($178) by his weekly income ($2). This gives us 89 weeks. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can round up to 50 weeks."
"Response: 40 feet

Explanation:
The given information can be represented as follows:
Dinosaur's height = 10 feet (assumed)
Water depth = 100 feet (given)
To find out how much deeper the water is than Dinosaur's height, we subtract their height from the water depth:
Water depth - Dinosaur's height = 100 - 10 = 90 feet
Now, we know that if Dinosaur stands at a depth of 90 feet, then the water is 10 times deeper than his height. Therefore, the answer is 40 feet."
"Response: 20 feet
Explanation:
According to the passage, Dino is 8 steps lower than Ron. If Ronaldo was standing at 14 steps above sea level and the water was twice as deep as Din's height, then the depth of the water would be 2 times 8 = 16 feet + 8 = 24 feet. Therefore, the water was 24 feet deep."
"Response: 10 feet
Explanation:
Ron's height is given as 12 feet, and Dyn's height is given as 11 feet. Since Ron is 12 feet tall and Dyn is 11 feet tall, the difference in their heights is 1 foot. Therefore, if Ron stood on the bottom of the sea where the water was 5 times deeper than his height (i.e., 5 x 12 = 60 feet), he would be at a depth of 60 - 1 = 59 feet below the surface."
"Response: 20
Explanation: According to the passage, Dino is 4 feet (or 120 cm) taller than Ron. The water was 15 times deeper than Dino's height, which means it was 15 x 120 = 1800 feet (or 549 meters) deep. Since one foot is equal to 0.3048 meters, we can convert the depth of the water as follows: 1800 ft × 0.3048 m/ft = 549 m. Therefore, the water was 549 meters deep."
"Response: 20
Explanation:  According to the information provided in the question, Ron was 13 feet tall and the water was 16 times deeper than his height. Therefore, if Ron stood at 13 feet, the water would have been 16 x 13 = 200 feet deep."
"Response: 21 meters
Explanation:
Ron is 15 meters tall and DIn is 6 meters tall, so their difference in height is 9 meters (15 - 6 = 9). Since the water is 9 times deeper than Din's height, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is 81 meters."
"Response: 17

"Response: 52
Explanation: According to the question, Brajan has 9 books and 46 magazines on each of the 10 shelves. Therefore, he has a total of 9 x 10 = 90 shelves. Since there are 46 magazines on each shelf, the total number of magazines is 46 x 90 = 4080."
"Response: 475

Explanation:
Brajan has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of the 29 drawers with books, so he has a total of:

23 x 29 = 647 books
61 x 29 = 1709 magazines

Therefore, Brajan has a total of 475 items (books + magazines) in his drawers."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Brian has 7 shelves with the same number of books on each shelf. If he has a total of 28 books, then there are 4 books on each shelf (28 / 7 = 4)."
"Response: 4
Explanation: According to the question, Brian has looked at 2 books from each of 4 police boxes, which means he has looked at a total of 8 books (2 x 4 = 8). Therefore, there are 38 - 8 = 30 police boxes."

Explanation: If Carol sent invitations to 10 friends and each package of invitations contained 2 invitations, then she would need to send at least 4 packages of invitations so that no friend is left out."
"Response: 36
Explanation: According to the question, Karol sent invitations for her birthday party to 12 friends. Since she bought three packages with the same number of invitations, there are 36 invitations in total (12 x 3 = 36)."
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Carol bought 7 packages of invitations, each containing 10 invitations. Therefore, she sent out a total of 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Since she only sent invitations to 2 friends, there will be 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over."
"Response: 35
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Carol sent out 14 invitations per package she bought and bought 6 packages. Therefore, she sent out a total of 14 x 6 = 84 invitations. Additionally, she bought 11 more invitations, bringing the total number of invitations she can send to 84 + 11 = 95. So, her friends can receive up to 95 invitations from Carol."
Response: 3 + 2 = 5 additional invitations needed to call 9 friends.
"Response: 5 games
Explanation: According to the question, Melisa scored 12 points in each game, which means she scored a total of 36 points across 5 games."
"Response: 40
Explanation: According to the question, Melisa played 3 games and scored an overall total of 81 points, with the same score for each game (i.e., she scored 27 points per game). Therefore, the number of points she scored in each game is 40 (27 x 3 = 40)."
"Response: 546
Explanation:
From the given information, Melisa has scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points in each game. Therefore, she has scored a total of 109 x 79 = 8361 points in all games. Since there are 79 games in total, her average score per game is:
Average score = Total score / Number of games = 8361 / 79 = 546 points
Therefore, Melisa has scored 546 points in each game."
Response: 4 games played by Melisa. Explanation: According to the given information, Melisa scored 7 points in each game she played. Therefore, if she played x games, then the total number of points she scored is 7x. Since the total number of points she scored is 21, we can set up the equation 7x = 21 and solve for x. Solving the equation, we get x = 4, which means that Melisa played 4 games.
Response:  Melisa has scored an average of 6.85 points per game (91 points / 13 games).

= 2
Therefore, there are 2 seats at Ferris Colet's Parade Park."
Response: 380 people can ride 20 laps at once. Explanation: Each circle in Paradise Park has 19 seats, and each seat can accommodate 15 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride 20 laps at once is: 19 x 15 = 275 people. However, since there are 20 circles in total, we need to multiply the number of people by 20 to get the final answer: 275 x 20 = 5500 people.
"Response: 70
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ferris wheel at Paradise Park has 18 seats and each seat can accommodate 15 people. If 10 seats are broken, then the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at once is 18 - 10 = 8 times 15 = 70 people."
"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Ferris wheel at Paradise Park has 6 seats that can accommodate 14 people each. If there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, then we can add another 16 people (since each seat can hold 14 people). Therefore, the total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel is 32."
"Response: 28

Explanation:
Let's assume that each pizza has an equal number of slices. If we have 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then the total number of slices is 7 x Number of slices per pizza = 7 x 8 = 56 slices. Since there are 14 parts in total, the number of slices in each part is 56 / 14 = 4 slices per part."
"Response: 14
Explanation: According to the question, each pizza has 2 slices, and there are total of 28 slices in all. Therefore, if we have ordered pizzas with a total of 28 slices, then we must have ordered half as many pizzas (i.e., 14) since each pizza has 2 slices."

Response: 45 seeds.
"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, Pejja helped her mother plant 45 seeds in 9 flower beds. If they put the same number of seeds in each flower bed, then they would have put 5 seeds in each flower bed (45 / 9 = 5)."
Response:  There were 36 seeds planted in total, and only 58 of them germinated into flowers. Therefore, there are 22 (58 - 36) flower pots.
Response: 37 flowers. Explanation: According to the question, Pejja helped her mother plant 55 seeds and they together sowed 15 seeds in each flower pot. This means that they sowed a total of 55 x 15 = 825 seeds. Since only 60 seeds grew into flowers, the number of flowers that grew is 825 - 60 = 765 flowers. Therefore, there were 37 flowers in each of the 21 flower pots.
"Response: 6
Explanation: According to the question, Payja helped her mother plant 10 seeds in each flower pot, and they planted 60 seeds in total. Therefore, if they planted 60 seeds, they would have 6 flower pots."

Explanation: According to the question, Mathew had 11 friends and gave each of them 2 creamers. Therefore, the total number of creamers given by Mathew is 2 x 11 = 22."
Response: 4 creekers.
Response: 30 crekers. Explanation: According to the question, Matthew had 15 crekers initially. If he gave an equal number of crekers to each of his 5 friends, then he would have given away 15 x 5 = 75 crekers. This means that Matthew still has 15 - 75 = -60 crekers left. Since negative numbers are not possible in this context, we can conclude that Matthew must have given away all of his crekers and now has none left.
"Response: 30
Explanation: According to the question, Mathew had 24 creepers initially. If he gave an equal number of creepers to his three friends, then he would have given away 24 / 3 = 8 creepers to each friend.

Explanation:
Debi bought 153 bottles of water when they were half-empty. She drank the same number of bottles each day. If she drank from these bottles for 17 days, then she would have drunk a total of 49 bottles (153 / 2 = 49)."
"Response: 309

Explanation:
Debi bought 264 bottles of water when they were on sale for $1 each. If she drank 15 bottles per day for 11 days, she would have drunk a total of:

15 bottles/day x 11 days = 165 bottles

So Debi has 264 - 165 = 99 bottles left."
Response:  Debi has been drinking water for several days and has consumed 301 bottles so far. If she drank 144 bottles per day, then she must have drunk for x number of days. Therefore, the remaining amount of water is equal to 157 bottles / x = x days. So, x = 5 days.
"Response: 20 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debi bought 88 bottles of water and 13 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drank 4 bottles of water and 87 bottles of soda per day, how many days would the bottles last? To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles consumed per day: 88 / 4 = 20. Therefore, the bottles of water would last for 20 days."
"Response: 7 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debi bought 200 bottles of water and 256 bottles of soda when they were on sale. If she drank 312 bottles of water and 4 bottles of soda per day, it means that she consumed all of the bottles of soda within 7 days (since there are 256 bottles of soda). Therefore, the answer is 7 days."
"Response: 4 days
Explanation: If Debi drinks 6 bottles of water per day and buys a total of 12 bottles of water, she will be able to sustain herself for 4 days (since 12 / 6 = 2)."
"Response: 3 days
Explanation: According to the problem, Debi bought 95 bottles of soda and 180 bottles of water when they were on sale. If she drank 15 bottles of water and 54 bottles of soda per day, how many days would the bottles last? To find out, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles consumed per day: 95 / 15 = 6 days; 180 / 54 = 3.4 days. Since you can't have a fraction of a day, the bottles will last for 3 days."
"Response: 45 days
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Debi bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale. If she drank 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, it means that the soda would last for 45 days (360 / 9 = 45)."

Response: 360 places (98 students / 21 classrooms).
Response: 672 students. Explanation: The number of school buses (95) multiplied by the number of seats per bus (118) gives us the total number of seats available for transporting students to and from school, which is equal to 10,736 seats. Dividing this number by the maximum capacity of each bus (which is assumed to be 84 students in this case) gives us the total number of students that can be accommodated by the school's transportation system, which is equal to 672 students.
Response: 10 school buses are needed to transport all students for the field trip. Explanation: Let's assume that each school bus can accommodate 6 passengers. Since there are 67 schools in total, and each school has 66 students, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each school bus to determine how many school buses are required. Therefore, 67 x 66 = 4232 students will be transported per school bus, and since there are 10 schools participating in the field trip, we need 10 x 4232 = 42,320 students to be transported in total. So, 10 school buses are needed to transport all students for the field trip.
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many school buses are needed for the excursion, we need to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. Since there are 58 students in each class and 87 classes in total, the total number of students is 58 x 87 = 4910. If each bus can accommodate 2 students, then we need 4910 / 2 = 4 buses to transport all the students."
Response:  There are 120 students in total at the school. Since there are 24 classrooms and each classroom has an equal number of students (as stated in the problem), then there must be 5 students per classroom. Therefore, there are 5 x 24 = 120 students in the school.
"Response: 4
Explanation: To determine how many buses are needed for the excursion, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats in each bus. Since there are 102 students and 8 seats per bus, we can calculate that 4 buses are needed for the excursion."
"Response: 96
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 102 teaching positions at school and 11 students who do not want to go on the trip. Therefore, the number of students who will go on the trip is equal to 102 - 11 = 91 students. Since each bus can accommodate up to 99 students, the total number of students who will go on the trip is 91 x 99 = 96 students."
"Response: 4
Explanation: Let's assume that each school bus can accommodate 30 students (since there are 3 places in each bus). Since there are 72 teaching rooms in the school and 111 students in total, we need at least 4 school buses to transport all the students to the excursion destination. Therefore, the answer is 4."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. Since each bus can seat at most 5 students (as indicated by the word ""пуни"" which means ""full""), then the number of places available per bus is 5. Therefore, the total number of places available for all 46 buses is 5 x 46 = 230."

"Response: 10
Explanation: According to the question, there are 203 bananas organized in 7 groups and 63 portocales organized in 95 groups. To find out how many large each group of bananas is, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups they are organized in: 203 / 7 = 29.  Therefore, each group of bananas contains approximately 29 bananas. Similarly, to find out how many large each group of portocales is, we can divide the total number of portocales by the number of groups they are organized in: 63 / 95 = 0.66. Therefore, each group of portocales contains approximately 0.66 portocales."

Response: 4 groups
"Response: 15
Explanation: According to the question, there are 290 bananas organized into two groups and 87 portocals organized into 93 groups. To find out how large each group of bananas is, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups. In this case, the total number of bananas is 290, and the number of groups is 2, so each group has 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Similarly, for the portocals, the total number is 87, and the number of groups is 93, so each group has 0.9 (87 / 93 = 0.9) portocals."
"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the question, there are 384 portocales and 192 bananas in Filip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups, then each group contains an average of 345/3 = 115 bananas. Since there are 16 groups of portocales, each group contains an average of 115/16 = 72 portocales. Therefore, each group of portocales contains 72 portocales."

"Response: 317 - 295 = 22

Explanation:
The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace after lunch is given as 317. The question asks how many more visitors came to the palace that day than visited it the previous day. To find this out, we subtract the number of visitors the previous day from the current number of visitors: 317 - 295 = 22. Therefore, there were 22 more visitors to the palace that day than the previous day."
"Response: 189

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in one day is x. Since 703 visitors came the previous day, we can write an equation:
x + 703 = 246
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 246 - 703
x = -457
Since negative numbers are not possible here, we will set it equal to zero:
x = 0
So, there were 0 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 25 days."
"Response: 44
Explanation: According to the question, there were 100 visitors at Buckingham Palace before noon. If there were 666 more visitors than the previous day, then there would be 666 - 100 = 566 additional visitors that day. Therefore, the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace that day is 100 + 566 = 666."
"Response: 406 x 327 = 130,520

Question: After a delicious lunch, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 132 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If 406 people visited Buckingham Palace in the past 327 days, how many people visited the palace before that day? "
"Response: 3670

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before noon is 45.
* The number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace that day is 829.

To find out how many visitors visited Buckingham Palace over the past 85 days, we can multiply the number of visitors by 85:

Number of visitors over 85 days = Number of visitors per day x Number of days
= 829 x 85
= 3670

Therefore, the answer to the question is 3670."
"Response: 4063

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace in one day is x. Since 557 visitors came to the palace on the day after the delicious breakfast, we can write an equation:
x + 557 = 71
Now, let's find out how many visitors went to the palace in 57 days:
x × 57 = 4063
So, there were 4063 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 57 days."
"Response: 41
Explanation: According to the passage, there were 39 pictures in the Buckingham Palace exhibition after they had a nice lunch. If 661 visitors came to the palace that day, then the number of visitors before noon was 600 + 661 = 721. Therefore, the difference between the number of visitors before and after noon is 721 - 600 = 121."
"Response: 462

Explanation:
The information given in the passage is as follows:

* The number of visitors to Buckingham Palace before that day was 419.
* There were 103 additional visitors after that day.
* A total of 92 visitors came to see Buckingham Palace that day.

Using these numbers, we can calculate the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace as follows:

Total number of visitors = Number of visitors before that day + Number of visitors after that day - Number of visitors who saw it that day
= 419 + 103 - 92
= 462

Therefore, the answer to the question is 462."

Question: After a delicious lunch, they went to see Buckingham Palace. There, Rachel found out that 512 visitors had come to Buckingham Palace that day. If there were 471 visitors before noon and 808 visitors in total in the past 89 days, how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace in the past 89 days?  Formulate a numerical answer.  Answer: 471 + 808 = 1279"
"Response: 368

Explanation:

Let's assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace per day is X. Since there were 705 visitors on the day in question, we can write an equation based on this information:

X + 191 = 705

Now, let's use the fact that there were 457 more visitors than in the previous 245 days:

X + 191 = 705
X + 457 = 1152

Subtracting X from both sides gives us:

457 = 368

Therefore, the answer is 368."
Response:  The current amount of wax he has is 103 grams, and he needs an additional 159 grams to attach the feathers together. Therefore, the total amount of wax needed is 262 grams.
Response: 19 grams. Explanation: If he currently has 260 grams of wax and needs 49 grams more to paint all the feathers, then he will have 309 grams of wax left over after painting all the feathers (260 + 49 = 309).
Response: 40 grams. Explanation: According to the question, Vasilij has already used 22 grams of wax for gluing feathers and needs an additional 40 grams to complete the job. Therefore, he has 40 grams of wax left after using it all up.

"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the passage, 94 of the grapevines were inspected and 90 bunches of grapes were required for each vine. Since there are 6 days in total, the number of bunches that would be filled per day is 90/94 = 12."
Response: 31 grapes per day.
"Response: 3580

Explanation:
To find out how many bottles of wine would be produced during 146 days, we need to multiply the number of grape bunches by the number of grapes in each bunch and then divide it by the number of days.

Number of grape bunches = 294 (as given in the question)
Number of grapes in each bunch = 244 (as given in the question)
Total number of grapes = Number of grape bunches x Number of grapes in each bunch = 294 x 244 = 69,584 grapes

Now, let's convert this amount into bottles of wine:
Assuming that one bottle of wine is equivalent to 4.5 liters (which is a common volume for a standard bottle of wine), we can calculate the total volume of wine produced as follows:
Volume of wine = Total number of grapes / Volume of one bottle = 69,584 grapes / 4.5 liters per bottle = approximately 15,320 liters of wine

Finally, to determine how many bottles of wine would be produced over 146 days, we can divide the total volume of wine by the number of days:
Number of bottles of wine produced = Total volume of wine / Number of days = 15,320 liters of wine / 146 days = approximately 105.5 bottles of wine per day

Therefore, if our winemaker were to produce wine continuously for 146 days using the same quantity of grapes, he would end up with approximately 105.5 bottles of wine per day."
"Response:  For 77 days, if each cooper of grapes is filled with 221 buckets of grapes per day, then the total number of buckets of grapes that will be filled during this period is:

$$ \text {Total number of buckets} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of buckets per day} $$
= $77 \times 221$
= $16,477$ buckets
Therefore, there will be $16,477$ buckets of grapes filled for $77$ days."
"Response: 3649 grapes
Explanation:
The problem states that after 57 stops, the farmer has checked his vineyard and found that 252 bunches of grapes have been filled into 108 barrels. To find out how many grapes would be filled in for 58 days, we need to multiply the number of bunches by the number of days. Since there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), multiplying by 58 gives us 20967 grapes. However, since the problem asks for the number of grapes that would be filled in, not the total number of grapes produced, we must divide this amount by 58 to get our final answer of 3649 grapes."
"Response: 15 days
Explanation: According to the problem statement, 36 grapes are required to fill 8 barrels daily, and there are 240 barrels of wine needed to be filled. Therefore, it will take 15 days (240 / 36 = 15) for all the grape must to be collected."

Explanation:
If Postać must deliver 5 spam emails to each block and there are X houses in each block, then he will have to deliver a total of 5X spam emails. Since he can only carry 25 spam emails at a time, he will have to make X/5 trips to deliver all the spam emails. Therefore, the answer is 100."
"Response: 4
Explanation:
If there are 20 houses in each block and Posta needs to deliver 9 spam emails to each house, then she needs to deliver a total of 180 spam emails (20 x 9 = 180). Since each block has 5 houses that don't receive any spam emails, Posta needs to deliver 4 more packages of spam emails to the remaining 10 houses in each block (5 x 4 = 20). Therefore, the number of parcels of spam emails that Posta must deliver to each block is 4."
"Response: 32
Explanation: Since there are 6 houses in each block, and the postman needs to deliver 24 packages to each house, the total number of packages that need to be delivered is 6 x 24 = 144. Therefore, the answer is 32 (the number of packages per house)."

Response: 160 packages (32 packages per block x 5 blocks).
"Response: 45
Explanation: To determine how many packages of unwanted mail should be given to each house in a block with 19 houses, we need to divide the total number of unwanted packages by the number of houses in the block. In this case, there are 30 packages of unwanted mail and 19 houses in each of the 78 blocks, so we can give 30 / 19 = 45 packages of unwanted mail to each house in a block."
"Response: 32/55 = 0.6
Explanation: According to the question, Postać must deliver 8 packages of spam per each of the 55 blocks. Since there are 32 houses in each block, if he delivers 32 packages to each house, he will have delivered a total of 32 x 55 = 1760 packages."
"Response: 36
Explanation:
Since there are 81 blocks in total and each block has 12 houses, the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 972.
As Postač needs to deliver 4 spam emails per house, the total number of spam emails that need to be delivered is 972 x 4 = 3888.
Therefore, Parche needs to deliver 3888 - 36 = 3852 spam emails in total."
"Response: 20
Explanation:
Since there are 16 blocks and each block has 17 houses, the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 252 houses in the entire area.
If Posta needs to deliver 4 packages of spam mail to each house, he will need to deliver a total of 4 x 252 = 1008 packages of spam mail.
Therefore, Posta needs to give 20 parcels of unwanted mail to the residents of the area."

Explanation:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let S be the total number of skittles in Steven's collection = 4502. Let G be the total number of groups = 154. Since each group contains an equal number of skittles and gummies, we can write:

S + G = 4502... (1)

Now, let's find out how many skittles are in each group:

Number of skittles in each group = Total number of skittles / Number of groups
= 4502 / 154
= 29

So, there are 29 skittles in each group. Now, let's find out how many guppies are in each group:

Number of guppies in each group = Total number of guppies / Number of groups
= 4276 / 154
= 27

Therefore, there are 27 guppies in each group. To find out how large each group is, we divide the number of skittles or guppies by 29 or 27, respectively:

Group size = Number of skittles/guppies per group x 29/27
= 29 x 27
= 793

So, each group contains approximately 793 skittles or guppies. Finally, since there are 154 groups in total, we can multiply the group size by 154 to get the total number of skittles or guppies:

Total number of skittles = Group size x Number of groups
= 793 x 154
= 123,322

Similarly, the total number of guppies is:

Total number of guppies = Group size x Number of groups
= 793 x 154
= 123,322

Therefore, there are approximately 123,322 skittles and 123,322 guppies in Steven's collection."
"Response: 27
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Steve has 3941 skittles and 4950 guards. If we divide the number of skittles by the number of guards, we get an average of 3941 / 495 = 8. This means that each group of guards is approximately 8 skittles large. Since there are 495 groups in total, each group must be approximately 495 x 8 = 3760 skittles large. Therefore, the answer is 3760."
"Response: 24
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there are 896 skittles in Steven's collection. If we divide this number by 8, we get 111 skittles per group. Since Steven also has 517 gummies and 90 vials of liquid, each group would contain an equal amount of these items as well (i.e., 13 gummies and 1 vial). Therefore, there are 24 groups of skittles, gummies, and vials in total."
Response: 14 (since there are 5 students in each grade and there are as many grades as there are total number of students).
"Response: 22680
Explanation: To find out how many students there are in total, we need to multiply the number of classes by the number of students in each class. Since there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students, the total number of students is: 304 x 75 = 22680."
