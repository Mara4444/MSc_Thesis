"Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 18 children.  On Tuesday, she played tag with 10 children. To find out how many more children Julia played with on Monday than on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of children she played with on Tuesday from the number of children she played with on Monday:

18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, Julia played with 8 more children on Monday than on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday (maandag), Julia played tag with 11 children.  On Tuesday (dinsdag), she played tag with 12 children. So, we can say that Julia played tag with more children on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played tag with on Tuesday and Monday is 12 - 11 = 1.
Response:  Julia played tag with 5 children on Monday and with some other children on Tuesday. If she played tag with 15 children in total, then she must have played with 10 children on Tuesday (since 15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 4 children (maandag).  On Tuesday, she played tag with 14 children (dinsdag). If she played tag with 16 children, then she must have played tag with 2 more children than she did on Tuesday. Therefore, Julia played tag with 14 + 2 = 16 children on Monday.
Response:  If Julia played tag with 16 children on Monday and she played more tag with 12 children than on Monday, then we can conclude that Julia played tag with 4 children on Tuesday (dinsdag in Dutch).
Response:  If Julia played tag with 14 children on Tuesday and she played more tag with 8 children on Monday than on Tuesday, then we can conclude that Julia played tag with 6 children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 17 children. On Tuesday, she played with 15 children. And on Wednesday, she played with only 2 children. Therefore, Julia has played tag together with a total of: 17 + 15 + 2 = 34 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 15 children. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children. So far, we have 15 + 18 = 33 children that Julia has played tag with. Now comes Wednesday, where Julia played tag with 97 children! Therefore, the total number of children Julia has played tag with is 33 + 97 = 120 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 5 children.  On Tuesday, she played with 9 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 15 children. So, in total, Julia played with 5 + 9 + 15 = 30 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 2 children. So, we have 2 + 0 = 2 children.  On Tuesday, she played tag with 14 children. And on Wednesday, she played tag with 16 children. Therefore, the total number of children Julia played tag with is 2 + 14 + 16 = 32 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 9 children.  On Tuesday, she played with 7 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 96 children. So, we can see that Julia had more fun playing tag with children on Monday than on Dinsday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Dinsday is: 9 - 7 = 2. Therefore, Julia had two more children to play tag with on Monday than on Dinsday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 14 children. On Tuesday, she played with 2 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 8 children. So, we can say that Julia played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is: 14 - 8 = 6. Therefore, Julia played with 6 more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 8 children.  On Tuesday, she played with 11 children. And on Wednesday, she played with 9 children. So, we can say that Julia had more children to play with on Tuesday than on Wednesday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday and Wednesday is:  11 - 9 = 2.
Response:  Monday - 15 children Tuesday - 18 children Wednesday - 7 children So, Julia played with more children on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday. The difference between Monday and Tuesday is 3 (15 - 12 = 3). Therefore, Julia played with 3 more children on Monday and Tuesday combined than she did on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 13 children. On Tuesday, she played with 10 children. So together, Julia has played with 23 children (13 + 10).
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with 7 children. On Tuesday, she played with 13 children. In total, she played with 20 children. So, together they have knotted 7 + 13 = 20 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 12 children for 34 hours. Therefore, she played with each child for 34/12 = 2.83 hours per child (approximately).  On Tuesday, Julia played tag with 14 children for 34 hours. So, she played with each child for 34/14 = 2.43 hours per child (approximately). Since Julia has played with both groups of children, we can add up the total number of hours she spent playing with all the children: 2.83 + 2.43 = 5.26 hours. Therefore, Julia played tag with a total of 12 + 14 = 26 children.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played tag with 19 children for 38 hours. So, she played tag with each child for 2 hours (38 hours / 19 children = 2 hours per child).  On Tuesday, Julia played tag with 18 children for 38 hours. So, she played tag with each child for 2.06 hours (38 hours / 18 children = 2.06 hours per child). Since Julia played more than 2 hours with each child on Monday, she played more children on Monday than on Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is:  More children on Monday.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with six children. On Tuesday, she played with five children. So, we can say that Julia played with more children on Monday than on Tuesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1.
Response:  Julia played tag with a total of 18 children. On Monday she played with 4 children and on Tuesday she played with more than 4 children. So, the number of children Julia played with on Tuesday is greater than 4. Therefore, the answer is 5 or more.
Response:  On Monday, Julia played with six children. On Wednesday, she played with four children. So, we can say that Julia played with more children on Monday than on Wednesday. The difference between the number of children Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday is:  6 - 4 = 2 Therefore, Julia played with two more children on Monday than on Wednesday.
Response:  At first, Bobby had eaten 25 snoopies. Then he ate additional 43 snoopies. So, in total, Bobby had eaten 25 + 43 = 68 snoopies.
Response:  Bobby had already eaten 28 pieces of candy before he ate another 42. So in total, he has eaten 28 + 42 = 70 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of candies that Bobby has eaten is 70 + 63 = 133 pieces.
Response:  Bobby had already eaten 33 snoopies before he added four more. So, in total, he has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 snoopies. Then, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, Bobby has eaten altogether 37 + 14 = 51 treats.
Response:  Bobby has eaten 38 pieces of candy and then another 36. So he has eaten in total 74 pieces of candy. Then we are told that he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy that Bobby has eaten more than chocolate is:  74 - 16 = 58  So, Bobby has eaten 58 pieces of candy more than chocolate.
Response:  At first, Bobby has 20 snoepjes. Then he eats 34 snoepjes, so now he has 20 - 34 = -14 snoepjes (he is in debt). Finally, he eats another 18 snoepjes, so his new balance is -14 + 18 = 4 snoepjes. Therefore, Bobby has eaten 4 snoepjes.
Response:  Bobby initially had 21 snoopjes and then he ate five of them. So, he has nine left. Therefore, Bobby has 9 snoopjes left.
Response:  When Bobby started eating his snoopies he had 22 in total. Then he ate some and had 17 left (5 + 12). So when he started eating, he had 22 - 5 = 17 snoopies.
Response:  Bobby had initially 19 snoepjes and then he ate two of them. So, now he has 19 - 2 = 17 snoepjes left.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 snoepjes and he has eaten some of them, then he must have x snoepjes left. We know that x is a positive integer because Bobby doesn't eat negative snoepjes! So we can write an equation: 32 - x = 20 (1) Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can add 32 to both sides of the equation: 32 + x = 52 (2) Subtracting 32 from both sides gives us: x = 20 (3) Therefore, Bobby has eaten 20 snoepjes.
Response:  At first, Bobby has 36 snoepjes and he is 15 years old. Then, after 2 years (when he is 17), he still has 36 snoepjes. So, he hasn't eaten any of them during these 2 years. Therefore, he still has 36 snoepjes when he is 17 years old.
Response:  At first, Bobby has 30 snoepjes and then he eats 23 of them. So, he still has 7 snoepjes left (30 - 23 = 7).
Response:  We know that Alan has five balloons and Jake has three balloons. So, we can say that Alan has X more balloons than Jake. Since X is greater than zero (since Alan has more balloons), we can write this as X = 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, Alan has two more balloons than Jake in the park.
"Response:  If Alan has two balloons and Jake has three balloons, then Jake has one more balloon than Alan. So, we can write this as:
J = A + 1
Where ""A"" is the number of balloons that Alan has (i.e., 2) and ""J"" is the number of balloons that Jake has (i.e., 3). Substituting this expression into the equation above gives us:
J = 2 + 1
= 3
So, Jake has three more balloons than Alan in the park."
Response:  If Allan brought two balloons to the park and Jake took three balloons with him, then we can say that Jake has taken three - two = one more balloon than Allan to the park. Therefore, Jake took one extra balloon to the park.
Response:  If Jake has six balloons and he brought four more than Allan, then we can say that Allan had x balloons initially. Since Jake brought four more balloons than Allan, we can write an equation as follows: 6 = 4 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Allan had two balloons initially.
Response:  If Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 6 more than Allan, then Jake must have 6 + 5 = 11 balloons in total. Therefore, Jake has taken 11 - 5 = 6 additional balloons from Allan.
Response:  Firstly, Alan brought three balloons to the park and then he bought two more balloons there. So, initially, Alan had three + two = five balloons at the park. Now, Jake brought five balloons to the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan and Jake had at the park was five (Alan's initial balance) + five (Jake's contribution) = ten balloons.
Response:  Allan brought two balloons to the park and then bought three more. So, initially, he had two + three = five balloons at the park. Now, Jake brought four balloons to the park. So, total number of balloons at the park now is five (Allan's) + four (Jake's) = nine. Therefore, Allan has one more balloon than Jake at the park.
Response:  We know that Alan has two balls and bought three more in the park. So, he now has five balls (2 + 3 = 5).  Jake brought six balls to the park. Therefore, Jake has six - five = one more ball than Alan in the park.
Response:  We know that Alan has brought 5 balloons and Jake has brought 4 balloons to the park. So together they have 9 balloons (5 + 4). Then Alan buys 3 more balloons at the park. Therefore, the total number of balloons that Alan has taken to the park is 9 + 3 = 12 balloons.
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balloons and Jake has 2 balloons initially. Then, Jake buys 3 more balloons in the park. So, now Jake has 5 balloons (2 + 3). Now we need to find out how many balloons Allan has compared to Jake. To do this, we can subtract the number of balloons Jake has from the total number of balloons Allan has: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, Allan has one more balloon than Jake in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan has 6 balloons and Jake has 3 balloons initially. Then, Jake buys 4 more balloons in the park. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of balloons with Allan = 6 Number of balloons with Jake = 3 + 4 = 7 Now, we need to find out how many balloons Jake has more than Allan. To do this, subtract the number of balloons Allan has from the total number of balloons Jake has:  Number of balloons Jake has more than Allan = 7 - 6 = 1 Therefore, Jake has one more balloon than Allan in the park.
Response:  We know that Jake has six balloons and he bought three more at the park. So, how many balloons does Jake have now?  Six + Three = Nine. Therefore, Jake has nine balloons.
Response:  We know that Alan has 3 balloons and 20 balls. So, he has a total of 23 objects (3 + 20 = 23). Now, we are told that Jake has 5 ballons and 59 balls. So, he has a total of 64 objects (5 + 59 = 64). Therefore, the final answer is:  Alan has 23 objects, and Jake has 64 objects in the park.
Response:  We know that Allan has 7 balls and Jake has 6 balls. So together they have 7 + 6 = 13 balls in the park.
Response:  If Allan has five balloons and they have six together, then Allan had zero balloons at first (since he already had five). So Jake must have taken one balloon with him when they went to the park. Therefore, Jake has one balloon.
Response:  We know that Allan had two balloons at first and then bought three more. So, he has five balloons in total (2 + 3 = 5). Now, we are told that Jake brought six balloons to the park. This means that Jake has six balloons more than Allan. In other words, Jake has 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.
"Response: 
Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and two hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent learning Chinese from the total time spent learning both languages. So, let's do that:
Total time spent learning both languages = 6 + 2 = 8 hours/day
Time spent learning Chinese = 2 hours/day
Now, we can calculate the difference between the total time spent learning both languages and the time spent learning Chinese:
Difference = Total time spent learning both languages - Time spent learning Chinese
= 8 - 2
= 6 hours/day
So, Ryan spends 6 hours more per day learning English than he does learning Chinese."
Response:  According to the question, Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese. To find out how many more hours he spends learning Chinese than English, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends learning English from the total number of hours he spends learning both languages. So, in this case, the difference is: 6 (hours spent learning English) - 7 (total hours spent learning both languages) = -1 hour. Therefore, Ryan spends one less hour learning English than he does learning Chinese.
"Response:  If Ryan spends three hours per day learning English and more than that learning Chinese, then he must spend x hours per day learning Chinese. Since he learns both languages daily, we can write an equation as follows:
3 + x = 4 (hours/day)
Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 4 - 3
x = 1
So, Ryan spends one hour per day learning Chinese."
Response:  If Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English and more than that learning Chinese, then he must spend at least 5 hours per day learning Chinese (since 7 - 2 = 5). So, Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning Chinese.
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends five hours per day learning Chinese and more than that learning English. So he spends x hours per day learning English. Since he learns 2 hours more English than Chinese, we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
Therefore, Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English."
"Response: 
Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and seven hours per day learning Chinese. If he learns for five days, then he will spend a total of:
6 x 5 = 30 hours learning English
7 x 5 = 35 hours learning Chinese
So in total, Ryan spends 30 + 35 = 65 hours learning both languages over five days."
Response:  If Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and five hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 6 + 5 = 11 hours per day studying languages. Since he only has two days to learn, he will spend 11 hours / 2 = 5.5 hours per day learning English. Therefore, Ryan spends 5.5 hours per day learning English.
Response:  If Ryan spends 5 hours per day learning English and 4 hours per day learning Chinese, then in one day he will spend 5 + 4 = 9 hours learning both languages combined.  Since there are 6 days in total, Ryan will spend 9 x 6 = 54 hours learning both languages altogether.
Response:  If Ryan spends 4 hours per day learning English and 6 hours per day learning Chinese, then he will spend a total of 4 x 86 = 352 hours learning English in 86 days. Similarly, he will spend a total of 6 x 86 = 517 hours learning Chinese in 86 days. Therefore, Ryan spends 352 hours per day learning English and 517 hours per day learning Chinese.
"Response: 
Ryan spends six hours per day learning English, seven hours per day learning Chinese, and three hours per day learning Spanish. So in total, he spends:
6 + 7 + 3 = 16 hours per day learning languages."
Response:  We know that Ryan spends six hours per day learning English and three hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, he learns English for 6 x 6 = 36 hours per week and Chinese for 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week. Now we want to find out how many hours he spends more on English than on Chinese. To do this, we subtract the number of hours he spends on Chinese from the total number of hours he spends on both languages:  Total time spent on both languages = 36 hours/week + 9 hours/week = 45 hours/week Time spent on English > Time spent on Chinese (by 17 hours)
"Response:  We know that Ryan spends 7 hours per day learning English, 2 hours per day learning Chinese, and 4 hours per day learning Spanish. To find out how many more hours he spends learning English than Spanish, we need to subtract the time he spends learning Spanish from the total time he spends learning both languages. So, let's do this calculation:

Total time spent learning both languages = Total time spent learning English + Total time spent learning Spanish
= 7 hours/day + 4 hours/day
= 11 hours/day

Now, let's find out how much more time Ryan spends learning English than Spanish:

More time spent learning English than Spanish = Total time spent learning English - Total time spent learning Spanish
= 11 hours/day - 4 hours/day
= 7 hours/day

So, Ryan spends 7 hours more per day learning English than he does Spanish."
"Response:  According to the question, every day, Ryan spends two hours learning English, five hours learning Chinese, and four hours learning Spanish. To find out how much time he spends more on Chinese than on Spanish, we need to subtract the amount of time he spends on Spanish from the total amount of time he spends on Chinese. So, let's do that:

Total time spent on Chinese = 5 hours
Time spent on Spanish = 4 hours
Difference between time spent on Chinese and time spent on Spanish = Total time spent on Chinese - Time spent on Spanish
= 5 hours - 4 hours
= 1 hour
Therefore, Ryan spends one hour more on Chinese than on Spanish."
Response:  If Ryan spends three hours learning English and Chinese every day, then he learns English for 2 hours and Chinese for 1 hour (3 - 2 = 1). So, Ryan spends one hour learning Chinese each day.
Response:  Day 1: Ryan spends 4 hours learning English and 5 hours learning Chinese. Total time spent = 9 hours (4 + 5). Day 2-7: Ryan continues to spend 4 hours per day learning English and 5 hours per day learning Chinese. Therefore, total time spent each day = 9 hours x 7 days = 63 hours (4 + 5). In total, Ryan learns for 63 hours over 7 days.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected eight bags of plastic bottles. The next day, she found seven more bags. So, in total, Tiffany collected 8 + 7 = 15 bags of plastic bottles.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 7 bags of cans for recycling. The next day, she found an additional 12 bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans on the second day.
Response:  If Tiffany collected four bag of cans on Monday and found more bags with cans on Tuesday, then she must have collected a total number of bags = 4 + x, where x is the number of additional bags found on Tuesday. Since there are six bags in total, we can write the equation: Total number of bags = 6. Substituting the value of x from the problem, we get: Total number of bags = 6 + x. Solving for x, we find that Tiffany found an additional 2 bags of cans on Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is 6 + 2 = 8.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 2 bags of plastic bottles. The next day, she found an additional 4 bags. So, in total, Tiffany collected 6 bags of plastic bottles (2 + 4 = 6).
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 10 bags of cans. Then, on Tuesday, she found 3 more bags of cans. Finally, on Wednesday, she found 7 more bags of cans. So, in total, Tiffany collected 10 + 3 + 7 = 20 bags of cans. Therefore, the answer is 20.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tiffany collected 8 bags of cans. Then she found 10 more bags on day 2 and 4 more on day 3, for a total of 22 bags. So, after Monday, Tiffany has found 22 bags of cans.
Response:  On Monday, Tiffany collected 3 bags of cans. Then she found an additional 7 bags of cans and 44 bottles the next day. So, in total, Tiffany collected 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans and 44 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 17 red peppers and 16 green peppers in the basket. To find out how many more red peppers than green peppers are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of green peppers from the number of red peppers. So, the answer is: 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, there is one more red pepper than green pepper in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are five red chickens and eleven green chickens in the basket. Since we want to find out how many more green chickens than red chickens are in the basket, let's use the following equation: Number of green chickens = Total number of chickens - Number of red chickens In this case, the total number of chickens is 16 (5 + 11). So, if we subtract the number of red chickens from the total number of chickens, we get: Number of green chickens = 16 - 5 = 11 Therefore, there are 11 more green chickens than red chickens in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 10 red chickens and some green chickens in the basket. If there are 15 chickens in total, then the number of green chickens must be equal to 5 (15 - 10). Therefore, there are 5 green chickens in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are three red chickens and more green chickens than red chickens in the basket. So, if there are x green chickens in the basket, then there are 3x - 3 red chickens in the basket. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 3x - 3 = 10 (where 10 is the total number of chickens in the basket). Solving for x, we get: x = 7 (i.e., there are 7 green chickens in the basket).
Response:  We know that Zeven rode perziken (7), Vijftien gele perziken (15) and Acht groene perziken (8). So, we have a total of 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 perziken in the basket.
"Response:  We know that there are seven red chickens (peren), eighty-eight green chickens (geele peren), and eight green chickens (groene peren) in the basket. To find out how many more green chickens than red chickens are in the basket, we can use the following equation:

Number of green chickens = Number of red chickens + Number of green chickens

Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get:

Number of green chickens = 7 + 88 = 95

Therefore, there are 95 more green chickens than red chickens in the basket."
"Response:  We have:
Twee rode perziken (2 red chickens)
Zes gele perziken (6 yellow chickens)
Veertien groene perziken (14 green chickens)
To find out how many more green than yellow chickens there are, we can use the following equation:
Number of green chickens - Number of yellow chickens = Difference between green and yellow chickens
In this case, the number of green chickens is 14, and the number of yellow chickens is 6, so we can plug these values into the equation to get:
14 - 6 = 8
Therefore, there are 8 more green chickens than yellow chickens in the basket."
Response:  We know that there are 19 red chickens and 11 green chickens in the basket. Since we also know that there are more than 11 green chickens in the basket, this means that there must be fewer red chickens than green chickens. Therefore, there are more than 11 green chickens in the basket for every 4 red chickens. So, if there are 4 red chickens, then there are more than 4 x 11 = 44 green chickens in the basket.
Response:  We know that there are 90 yellow peaches and 16 green peaches in the basket. To find out how many red and green peaches are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of yellow peaches from the total number of peaches. So, the answer is: Red peaches = 90 - 6 = 84 Green peaches = 16
Response:  We know that there are 18 red peppers and 14 yellow peppers in the basket. Since we also know that there are 17 green peppers in the basket, this means that there must be at least one more yellow pepper than green pepper (otherwise, all of them would have been mentioned as being in the basket). So, the number of yellow peppers is greater than or equal to 17 - 1 = 16. Therefore, the number of yellow peppers in the basket is 16 + 1 = 17.
"Response:  We know that there are five red chickens, fourteen yellow chickens and six green chickens in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation:
5R + 14Y = 6G
Where R represents the number of red chickens (five), Y represents the number of yellow chickens (fourteen) and G represents the number of green chickens (six). Now let's solve for G:
Subtracting 5R from both sides gives us:
14Y - 5R = 6G
Now, dividing both sides by 14 gives us:
Y = 48
So, there are 48 yellow chickens in the basket. And since there are six green chickens, we can conclude that there are 48 + 6 = 54 green chickens in the basket too!"
Response:  We know that there are 65 baskets of chickens and each basket has 7 red chickens and 3 green chickens. So, we can write this as an equation: 7R + 3G = 65. Now, let's solve for R: R = 65 - 3G. Substituting G = 0 (since all baskets have at least 1 red chicken), we get R = 62. Therefore, there are 62 red chickens in total. Similarly, we can find the number of green chickens using the same equation: G = 65 - 7R. Substituting R = 62, we get G = 4. Therefore, there are 4 green chickens in total.
Response:  We know that there are 11 baskets of chickens and each basket has 10 red chickens and 18 green chickens. So, we can write this as an equation: 10R + 18G = 11 x (10 + 18) where R represents the number of red chickens and G represents the number of green chickens. Now, let's solve for R:  Substituting the values given in the question into the equation above, we get: 10R + 18G = 11 x (10 + 18)  Solving for R, we get: R = 70  Therefore, there are 70 red chickens in all the baskets combined.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 baskets of persimmons and each basket has 16 red persimmons and 18 green persimmons. So, we can write this as an equation:

6 x 16 = 10 + 18

Now, let's solve for the number of red persimmons:

16 x 6 = 96

So, there are 96 red persimmons in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 7 baskets of peaches and each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. So, we can write this as an equation: 7b = 10r + 2g where ""b"" represents the number of baskets (7), ""r"" represents the number of red peaches (10), and ""g"" represents the number of green peaches (2). Now we need to solve for ""b"". To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 7: 7b = 10r + 2g / 7  Now we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:  b = 10r + g / 7 Finally, we can substitute the values given in the question into the equation: b = 10(10) + 2(2) / 7 = 70 + 4 / 7 = 66 Therefore, there are 66 peaches in total - 7 baskets with 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches each."
Response:  We know that there are 4 red perches and 3 green perches in each of the 5 baskets. So, in total, there are 4 x 5 = 20 red perches and 3 x 5 = 15 green perches. Since there are 7 perches in all, we can deduce that there must be 20 / 7 = 2 baskets with only red perches and 15 / 7 = 2 baskets with only green perches. Therefore, there are 2 + 2 = 4 baskets containing red perches and 2 + 2 = 4 baskets containing green perches.
Response:  We know that there are two baskets of chickens and each basket has four red chickens and some green chickens. So, if we want to find out how many green chickens are in each basket, we can use the information given in the question. Accordingly, the number of green chickens in each basket is equal to the total number of green chickens divided by the total number of chickens in all baskets. Therefore, the number of green chickens in each basket is 4/6 = 2. So, there are 2 green chickens in each basket.
Response:  We know that there are 16 perchicks in total and 13 of them are red. So, if we subtract the number of red perchicks from 16, we get the number of green perchicks: 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green perchicks in the basket.
"Response:  We know that each mand has 19 red peppers and 4 green peppers. So, if there are 15 mands, then together they have:

19 x 15 = 285 red peppers
4 x 15 = 60 green peppers
In total, therefore, there are 285 + 60 = 345 peppers in the mands."
Response:  We know that there are ten perches in total and each mound has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. So, if we divide the number of red peaches by the number of mounds, we get 4/10 = 0.4. Similarly, if we divide the number of green peaches by the number of mounds, we get 6/10 = 0.6. Therefore, there are 5 mounds of peaches (0.4 x 10 = 4 + 0.6 x 10 = 6).
"Response:  We know that there are 6 green peppers and 2 red peppers in the basket. Since we don't have any information about how many of each type are present in the basket, let's assume that all the peppers are equally distributed among the three types (green, yellow, and red). Therefore, if x is the number of green peppers, y is the number of yellow peppers, and z is the number of red peppers, we can write the following equation to represent our situation:
x + y + z = 6... (1)
We also know that the total number of peppers in the basket is equal to the sum of the numbers of each type of pepper:
x + y + z = 60... (2)
Now, we want to find out how many more green peppers than red peppers are in the basket. To do this, we can subtract the number of red peppers from the number of green peppers:
number of green peppers - number of red peppers =?
Substituting equations (1) and (2), we get:
(x - y) - z =?
Simplifying, we get:
3x - 2y = 48
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 24
y = 20
Therefore, there are 24 green peppers, 20 yellow peppers, and 2 red peppers in the basket. So, there are 22 more green peppers than red peppers in the basket."
Response:  Jerry had four action figures on his plank initially. If he added more action figures later, then we can say that he has added x number of action figures. Since there are eight action figures in total on the plank, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 8. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 4. Therefore, Jerry added four additional action figures to his plank after having four initial ones.
"Response:  Jerry initially had $X$ action figures on his shelf. Then he added $7$ more action figures, so now there are a total of $X+7$ action figures on the shelf. Since there are $10$ action figures in total, we can set up the equation:
$$ X + 7 = 10 $$
Solving for $X$, we get:
$$ X = 3 $$
So Jerry originally had $3$ action figures on his shelf."
Response:  Jerry had initially 4 action figures and 22 books on his board. If he added 6 more action figures later, then the total number of action figures he had is: 4 + 6 = 10 action figures. Therefore, Jerry had 10 action figures on his board in total.
"Response:  We know that Jerry had five action figures and nine books on his plank initially. Then he added seven more action figures to the plank. So, now we have:
5 + 9 = 14 (total number of items on the plank)
Now, let's count how many action figures are left after adding the new ones:
14 - 7 = 7 (number of action figures left on the plank)
So, there are 7 action figures and 9 books on Jerry's plank."
Response:  Jerry had 10 books and 2 action figures initially. If he added 4 more action figures, that means there are now 6 action figures in total (including the initial 2). So, the number of books is still 10 - 6 = 4. Therefore, Jerry has 4 more books than action stickers.
Response:  Jerry started with 8 action figures and 9 books on the plank. Then he added 10 more books, so now he has 9 + 10 = 19 books on the plank. Therefore, Jerry had 19 books in total on his plank.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 7 action figures and 2 books on his plank. So, the total number of items was 7 + 2 = 9. Then, he added 4 more books to the plank, so now there are 9 action figures and 6 books (4 new books). Therefore, the final answer is 9 - 6 = 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's plank.
Response:  Jerry had five action figures and two books on a board in his room initially. Then he added nine more books to the board. So, the total number of items Jerry has is: 5 + 2 = 7 (action figures) + 9 = 16 (books). Therefore, Jerry had 16 more books than action figures.
Response:  At first, Jerry had 8 action figures on his plank. Then he added 4 new ones, so now he has 12 action figures (8 + 4 = 12). Finally, he removed 5 old action figures, leaving him with 7 action figures on his plank (12 - 5 = 7). Therefore, Jerry had 7 action figures on his plank at the end.
Response:  Jerry started with 3 action figures on his board and added 4 new ones later. So, he has a total of 7 action figures now (3 + 4 = 7). To find out how many he removed, we need to subtract the number of old action figures from the total number of action figures he has now. In this case, Jerry removed 2 old action figures (he mentioned that he removed some of the old ones), so he has 7 - 2 = 5 action figures left on his board.
Response:  Jerry started with 7 action figures on his board and added more later. If he removed 10 of the original action figures, that means there were initially 7 + 10 = 17 action figures on the board. Now, if there are 8 action figures left on the board after removing some, it means Jerry has added at least 8 - 17 = -9 action figures to the board. So, Jerry has subtracted 9 action figures from the total number of action figures on the board.
Response:  At first, Jerry had some action figures on a board in his room. Then he added two new action figures and removed seven of the old ones. So, if there are now ten action figures on the board, that means there were originally five action figures plus the two new ones Jerry added. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 + 2 = 7.
Response:  At first, Jerry had nine action figures on his board. Then he added seven more action figures to the board. So, after adding these new action figures, there were nineteen action figures on the board (9 + 7 = 16). Now, let's check how many books Jerry had on the board initially and then add the number of books that he got later. According to the question, Jerry had ten books on the board initially, so he had ten books plus the additional books that he received later. Therefore, the total number of books on Jerry's board was twenty (10 + x), where x is the number of additional books that Jerry received later. Since Jerry received seven additional books, the value of x is equal to seven. Thus, the final answer is:  Nineteen action figures + seven books = Twenty-six items on Jerry's board.
Response:  Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures initially. When he added two more action figures, there were now 6 action figures (including the initial four) plus the three books, for a total of 9 items on his plank. So, there are 9 - 3 = 6 more action figures than books on Jerry's plank.
Response:  Jerry had initially 7 books and 3 action figures on a board in his room. If he added two more action figures later, that means he now has 7 + 2 = 9 items on the board. So, Jerry had more than 3 action figures but fewer than 7 books. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 (books).
Response:  If there were initially 2 birds on the fence and more birds come, then the total number of birds on the fence is equal to the initial number plus the new birds that came. So, if there are 6 birds on the fence in total, then there must have been 4 birds initially on the fence (since 6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  At first, there were birds on the fence. Then four more birds came. So initially, there were five birds on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 5 vogels (5 x = 25). Then, 6 more vogels came along, so now we have 5 + 6 = 11 vogels on the fence. Therefore, there are 11 vogels on the fence.
"Response:  We know that there are three birds and two owls already sitting on the fence. If five other birds come to join them, then we have:
3 + 5 = 8 birds
So, in total, there are eight birds and two owls sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have three birds and four owls initially sitting on the fence. Two other birds come to join them. So now we have five birds in total (including the two new ones). However, there are still four owls on the fence. Therefore, the final number of birds is 5, while the number of owls remains at 4.
"Response:  At first, there were 2 birds and 6 owls on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came along. So, in total, we have:  
2 + 3 = 5 birds on the fence. And still, there are 6 owls. Therefore, the final number of ooievaars (owls) is still 6."
Response:  We have four birds (vogels) already sitting on the fence and two more coming to join them. So, in total we have six birds (ooievaars) sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have three birds and four owls already on the fence. If six more owls come, then we will have... (3 + 6 =)...9 birds and owls on the fence in total!
"Response:  We know that initially there were five birds and three owls sitting on the fence. If two more owls come, then we have:
5 birds + 2 owls = 7 creatures on the fence. So, there are seven creatures in total on the fence - three of them are owls. Therefore, there are four birds left (besides the owls)."
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 3 owls sitting on the fence. If 6 more owls come, then the total number of owls will be 6 + 3 = 9 owls. So, the total number of birds plus owls sitting on the fence is 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 creatures sitting on the fence in total.
"Response:  We know that there are four birds on the fence initially (Zes vogels zaten op het hek). Then, eight more owls came to join them (And eight more ooievaars kwamen hen vergezellen), so in total we have:
4 + 8 = 12 vogels on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 12."
Response:  We know that there are five more vogels than ooievaars accompanying them. So, if there were x ooievaars, then there would be x + 5 vogels on the fence. Therefore, the answer is x = 9.
Response:  We know that there are three birds sitting on the fence initially (vogels). Then, two other birds come to join them (twee andere vogels), making it five birds in total (vier Vogels + twee andere Vogels = 5 birds). Next, six more owls arrive (zes meer ooievaars), bringing the total number of birds and owls on the fence to 11 (elf Vogels + zes meer Ooievaars = 11 birds). So, there are 6 more owls than birds on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were five owls and three birds sitting on the fence. If four more birds come along, then the total number of birds will be:  5 + 4 = 9 birds. So, in total, there are now nine birds sitting on the fence, including the original three birds and six new ones who came later. Therefore, the answer is 9 - 3 = 6 more birds than owls sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 4 birds and 2 owls sitting on the fence. Then, 3 more birds came along. So, in total we have:  4 (birds) + 2 (owls) = 6 creatures sitting on the fence.
Response:  We know that initially there were 3 birds on the fence. Then, 6 owls and 2 more birds came along. So, in total, we have: 3 + 6 = 9 birds on the fence.
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages long and the second chapter has 11 pages long. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the answer is:  First chapter has 37 pages more than the second chapter (48 - 11 = 37).
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages long. So, if we multiply it with 2 (the number of chapters), we get 74 pages for the total length of the book. Now, we know that the second chapter is 80 pages long, which means that it covers additional 80 - 74 = 6 pages compared to the first chapter. Therefore, the second chapter has 6 more pages than the first one.
Response:  We know that the first chapter has 60 pages and there are total 93 pages in the book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages in second chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in first chapter Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into this equation: Number of pages in second chapter = 93 - 60 = 33 pages Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and we want to find out how many pages are in the first chapter. So let's start with the information given in the question:  The second chapter has 36 pages. If there are two chapters, then the total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter plus one (since there is an extra page for the title). Therefore, the number of pages in the first chapter can be calculated as follows: Number of pages in the first chapter = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second chapter  Number of pages in the first chapter = 67 - 36  Number of pages in the first chapter = 31 pages
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter has 66 pages. The second chapter has 35 pages, and the third chapter has 24 pages. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages. Therefore, the book has 125 pages in total.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter has 91 pages and the second chapter has 23 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter, we get: 91 - 23 = 68 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has more than 68 pages compared to the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 35 pages, and the second chapter has 18 pages less than that (since it is shorter). So, the second chapter has 35 - 18 = 17 pages. Now, we know that the third chapter has only 3 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 17 + 3 = 20 pages. Therefore, the second chapter has more than twice as many pages as the third chapter.
Response:  First, we know that the first chapter has 53 pages and the third chapter has 21 pages. So, if we subtract the number of pages in the third chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter, we get:  53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 32 more pages than the third chapter.
Response:  We know that each chapter has 61 pages long and there are 31 chapters in total. So, we can calculate the number of pages as follows: Number of pages = Total number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter Therefore, the number of pages for this book would be: Number of pages = 31 x 61 = 1931 pages
Response:  We know that there are 2 hoofdstukken and each hoofstuk has 23 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of pages in first hoofdstuk = Total number of pages / Number of hoofdstukken First hoofdstuk = 23 pages / 1 = 23 pages Now, we have found out that there are 23 pages in the first hoofdstuk.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters and each chapter has 81 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 = 81 pages Chapter 2 = x pages Now, we have to find out how many pages are in the second chapter. Since the second chapter is 68 pages long, we can substitute this value into our equation: Chapter 2 = 68 pages Substituting 68 for x in the previous equation, we get: Chapter 2 = 68 pages Solving for x, we get: x = 68 / 2 = 34 pages Therefore, there are 34 pages in the second chapter of the book.
Response:  We know that 62 people went for an early morning bike ride and 39 people went for a noon bike ride. So, we have to find out how many more people went for an early morning bike ride than those who went for a noon bike ride. To do this, we need to subtract the number of people who went for a noon bike ride from the total number of people who went for an early morning bike ride. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is equal to 62 - 39 = 23. So, 23 more people went for an early morning bike ride than those who went for a noon bike ride.
Response:  We know that 52 campers went for an early morning row and 61 campers went for lunchtime rowing. So, we can write this as follows:  Early Morning Row (52): 52 ---------- Lunch Time Row (61) : 61 ---------- To find out how many more campers went for lunch time rowing than those who went for early morning rowing, we need to subtract the number of people who went for early morning rowing from the number of people who went for lunch time rowing. Subtraction gives us the difference between these two numbers:  Difference = 61 - 52 = 9 Therefore, there are 9 more campers who went for lunch time rowing than those who went for early morning rowing.
Response:  We know that 15 campers went for an early morning rowing session and some of them went again in the afternoon. So let's assume that x number of campers went for the afternoon rowing session. Since there are 32 campers in total, we can write the equation as follows: 15 + x = 32. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: x = 17. Therefore, 17 campers went for the afternoon rowing session.
Response:  If some campers went rowing in the morning and 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon, then there are a total of 8 camper who went rowing (some + 7).  Therefore, if 60 campers went rowing, then 52 campers went rowing in the morning (60 - 8 = 52).
Response:  We know that 36 campers went for an early morning ride, 13 campers went for lunchtime ride and 49 campers went for evening ride. So, in total, we have: 36 + 13 + 49 = 108 campers who rode their bikes.
Response:  The number of campers who went for an early morning ride is given as 44.  The number of campers who went for a mid-day ride is given as 39.  And the number of campers who went for an evening ride is given as 31. So we can write:  Number of campers who went for an early morning ride = 44 Number of campers who went for a mid-day ride = 39 Number of campers who went for an evening ride = 31 Now, to find out how many more campers went for an early morning ride than for a mid-day ride, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for a mid-day ride from the number of campers who went for an early morning ride:  Number of campers who went for an early morning ride - Number of campers who went for a mid-day ride = 44 - 39 = 5 Therefore, there are 5 more campers who went for an early morning ride than for a mid-day ride.
Response:  We know that 53 campers went for an early morning rowing session, and 48 campers went for a mid-day rowing session. So far so good! However, when it comes to the evening rowing session, we are told that 49 campers participated. Now here is where things get interesting. If 53 campers went for an early morning rowing session and only 48 campers went for a mid-day rowing session, then how many more campers went for an evening rowing session than those who went for a mid-day rowing session? Well, to find out, we simply subtract the number of campers who went for a mid-day rowing session from the total number of campers who went for an evening rowing session: 53 - 48 = 5. Therefore, there were 5 more campers who went for an evening rowing session than those who went for a mid-day rowing session.
Response:  We know that 33 campers went for an early morning ride and 34 campers went for lunchtime ride. So far so good! But then we are asked how many more campers went for lunch than for dinner. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of campers who went for dinner from the number of campers who went for lunch. In other words, we need to subtract 34 from 33, which gives us 1. Therefore, there were 1 more camper who went for lunch than for dinner.
Response:  We know that 13 campers went rowing and 59 campers went walking in total. So, the number of campers who went rowing is equal to the number of campers who went walking plus 13. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went walking + 13  Now, let's find out how many campers went for a walk in the afternoon. According to the question, 21 campers went for a walk in the afternoon. So, we can add this value to our previous equation:  Number of campers who went rowing = Number of campers who went walking + 13 + 21  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of campers who went rowing = 74  Therefore, there were 74 campers who had gone rowing altogether.
Response:  We know that in total, 29 campers went rowing and 66 campers went walking. So, the total number of campers who went rowing is 29 + 66 = 95. Now, we are asked how many more campers went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon. Therefore, the difference between the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and those who went rowing in the afternoon is: 95 - 26 = 69. So, there were 69 more campers who went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning.
Response:  We know that 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went walking. So, in total, 45 campers (41 + 4) went for an activity. In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing. Therefore, the number of campers who went both rowing and walking is:  Number of campers who went rowing and walking = Total number of campers - Number of campers who only went rowing or walked. = 45 - 26 = 19.
Response:  We know that 43 campers went rowing in the morning and some more campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation: 43 + x = 46 (where x is the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 43 from both sides of the equation: x = 3 (since there were 3 additional campers who went rowing in the afternoon). Therefore, 3 campers went rowing in the afternoon.
Response:  At first, there were 7 apples on the tree and Rachel picked 4 of them. So, now there are 7 - 4 = 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  At first, Rachel had 4 apples on her tree. Then she picked some apples and now there are only 2 left on the tree. So, Rachel has picked __________ apples.
Response:  We know that Rachel picked seven ripe apples from her tree and now there are five apples left on the tree. If three of those five apples are ripe, then we have to subtract three from five to find out how many unripe apples are left on the tree. So, the number of unripe apples is 5 - 3 = 2. Therefore, the tree has two unripe apples left.
Response:  If Rachel picks two ripe apples from her tree and there are six ripe apples left, then the total number of apples on the tree is 6 + 2 = 8. So, the tree needs 8 - 2 = 6 more apples to be fully ripe again.
Response:  At first, the tree had six ripe apples (Rachel picked six). Now it has two ripe apples and four unripe apples. So initially, the tree had 6 + 2 = 8 apples.
Response:  At first, there were three rijpe apples on the tree (Rachel picked three). So initially, the tree had 3 + 2 = 5 rijpe apples. Now, the tree has 2 rijpe apples left and 27 unripe apples. Therefore, at the beginning, the tree had 5 rijpe apples.
Response:  In the beginning, Rachel picked seven apples from her tree. So, there were originally 7 apples on the tree. Then, two new apples grew on the tree. Therefore, after Rachel picked the original 7 apples, there were 9 apples on the tree (7 + 2). Now, the tree has 6 apples left (9 - 6 = 3), which is the number of apples the tree had in the beginning.  So, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  Rachel picked four apples from her tree, so there were three apples left on the tree initially (4 - 4 = 3). Then, three new apples grew on the tree, so now there are six apples in total (3 + 3 = 6) on the tree. Therefore, there are six apples on Rachel's tree now.
Response:  We know that Rachel has 52 apple trees and she picked two apples from one of them. So, there are now 50 apple trees left with apples. Each tree has 7 apples initially, so the total number of apples is 50 x 7 = 350 apples. Therefore, the answer is 350 apples.
Response:  If Rachel picked 8 apples from each of her three apple trees, then she took a total of 24 apples (3 x 8 = 24). So, there were originally 24 apples on all three trees combined.
Response:  If Rachel has four apple trees and she picked seven apples from each tree, then she picked a total of 4 x 7 = 28 apples. So, the answer is 28.
Response:  We know that Ed has 20 knickers more than Doug. So, if we subtract 4 (the number of knickers Doug lost) from Ed's total, we get: 20 - 4 = 16. Therefore, Doug lost 4 knickers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had more knick-knacks than Doug initially. So if Ed had 10 knick-knacks and Doug had x knick-knacks, then Ed had 10 + x = 20 knick-knacks in total.  Next, we are told that Doug lost 11 of his knick-knacks on the playground. So now Doug has x - 11 = 9 knick-knacks left.  Finally, we are asked how many knick-knacks Ed had more than Doug. To find this out, we need to subtract the number of knick-knacks Doug has from the number of knick-knacks Ed has. Therefore, Ed had 20 - 9 = 11 more knick-knacks than Doug.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed has more knick-knacks than Doug, so Ed has 22 knick-knacks and Doug has x knick-knacks.  Then, Doug loses 7 of his knick-knacks at the playground, which means he now has x - 7 knick-knacks.  Now, we are told that if Ed has 22 knick-knacks, then Doug must have x = 15 knick-knacks (since Ed has twice as many). So, Doug has 15 knick-knacks left after losing 7.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had five more knickers than Doug. So, if Ed had x knickers and Doug had x - 5 knickers, then we can write an equation as follows:
x = 5 + x - 5
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 10
Now, we are given that Ed had 27 knickers in total. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation:
2x = 27
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 13
So, Doug had 13 knickers left after losing three at the playground."
Response:  At first, Ed had 24 more knickers than Doug. So, Ed had 24 + 9 = 33 knickers in total. Then, Doug lost 27 of his knickers. Now, Doug has 33 - 27 = 6 knickers left. Therefore, Ed still has more knickers than Doug, with 33 - 6 = 27 more knickers.
Response:  Ed had initially 29 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had 29 + x = 36 (Doug's total number of marbles) marbles. After losing 17 marbles, Ed had 29 + x - 17 = 45 marbles. Since Doug had 36 marbles initially, we can conclude that Ed had 45 - 36 = 9 more marbles than Doug after he lost 17 marbles. Therefore, Ed had 9 more marbles than Doug.
"Response:  We know that Ed has 19 more knickers than Doug initially. So if Ed has x knickers now and Doug has y knickers, we can write an equation:
x = 19 + y
We also know that after losing some knickers at the playground, Ed has 8 fewer knickers than he did before. So we can write another equation:
x - 8 = y
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving them simultaneously gives us the following values:
x = 27
y = 11
So Ed lost 8 knickers at the playground."
Response:  We know that Ed had more knick-knacks than Doug initially. So if Ed had 30 knick-knacks and Doug had x knick-knacks, then we can write an equation: Ed = 30 + x. Since Ed lost 21 of his knick-knacks at the playground, he now has fewer knick-knacks than before. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as follows: Ed = 30 + x - 21. Now, according to the problem statement, Ed had 91 knick-knacks in total. So we can substitute this value into our equation: 91 = 30 + x - 21. Solving for x, we get: x = 61. Therefore, Doug had 61 knick-knacks initially.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ed had more knick-knacks than Doug initially. So, if Ed had 12 knick-knacks and Doug had x knick-knacks, then we can say that x = 12 - Doug's initial number of knick-knacks. Now, we are told that Ed lost 20 of his knick-knacks at the playground. This means that Ed now has 17 knick-knacks (12 - 20). Since Doug started with fewer knick-knacks than Ed, Doug must have gained some knick-knacks when Ed lost his. Therefore, Doug now has x + 20 knick-knacks. Substituting this value for x in our equation, we get: x + 20 = 12 - Doug's initial number of knick-knacks. Solving for x, we find that Doug now has 32 knick-knacks.
Response:  If 408 students want aardappelpuree and 42 students want bacon, then we have a total of 450 students (408 + 42). Now, if we divide the number of students who want aardappelpuree (408) by the number of students who want bacon (42), we get: 408 / 42 = 9.6 (round up to 10). So, there are 10 more students who want aardappelpuree than bacon.
Response:  If 479 students want aardappelpuree and 489 students want bacon, then we have a total of 479 + 489 = 968 students who want one or both of these food items.
Response:  We know that out of 310 students, 185 students suggested potato puree and others suggested meat (spek). So, the number of students who suggested meat is equal to 310 - 185 = 125. Therefore, 125 students suggested meat or spek.
Response:  If 288 students were asked to choose between two options -spek and aardappelpuree- then we can assume that 264 of them chose spek (since it was the most popular option). Therefore, the number of students who chose aardappelpuree is equal to 288 minus 264, which is 24. So, 24 students chose aardappelpuree.
Response:  If 457 students suggested potato puree and 63 more than that suggested bacon, then there are altogether 520 students who gave suggestions (since 457 + 63 = 520). Now, if among these 520 students, 63 more suggested bacon than those who suggested potato puree, then the number of students who suggested bacon is equal to 63 / (520 - 457) = 16. Therefore, 16 students suggested bacon.
"Response:  If 166 more students wanted bacon than aardappelpuree (which is 182), then we have:

More students wanted bacon = Total number of students - Number of students who preferred aardappelpuree
= 166 + 182 = 348

So, there were 348 students who wanted bacon."
Response:  If 324 students suggested applesauce, and 374 students suggested bacon, then there are 698 total suggestions (324 + 374). Since 128 students suggested tomatoes, we add that to the total number of suggestions, giving us 826 (698 + 128) new food suggestions from the students.
Response:  We know that 257 students wanted to have aardappelpuree (A).  We also know that 120 students wanted bacon (B). Finally, we know that 97 students wanted tomaten (T). So, we can write an equation using these values: A + B = T. Now, let's solve for A: A = T - B. Substituting the given values, we get: A = 257 - 120 = 137. Therefore, there are 137 more students who wanted aardappelpuree than bacon.
"Response:  We know that there are 144 students who want to have aardappelpuree ( AP).  We also know that there are 79 students who want to have tomaten ( TM). So, we can write this as an equation:
AP = 144
TM = 79
Now, let's find out how many more students want aardappelpuree than tomaten:
More Aardappelpuree = Total number of students wanting Aardappelpuree - Total number of students wanting Tomaten
= 144 - 79
= 65
So, there are 65 more students who want aardappelpuree than tomaten."
Response:  If 228 students wanted aardappelpuree and 337 students wanted bacon, then there are more students who want bacon than aardappelpuree (337 - 228 = 109). Similarly, if 23 students wanted tomatoes and 337 students wanted bacon, then there are more students who want bacon than tomatoes (337 - 23 = 314). Therefore, there are more students who want bacon than tomatoes.
Response:  We know that out of 450 students, 45 want aardappelpuree (since 45 x 1 = 45).  We also know that out of 450 students, 38 want spek (since 38 x 1 = 38). So far, we have a total of 45 + 38 = 83 students who want one of these two food options. Now, let's consider the remaining students who do not want either option. Since there are 66 choices in total, and 83 students have already chosen one of the first two options, then the number of students who did not choose any of the first two options is: 66 - 83 = 29. Therefore, 29 students want new food items.
"Response:  If 218 students wanted aardappelpuree and another 351 students only wanted spek, then the total number of students who wanted either or both of these food items is:

218 + 351 = 569

Therefore, there are 569 students in total."
Response:  If 330 students wanted aardappelpuree and 76 students wanted bacon, then there are 330 - 76 = 254 more students who wanted aardappelpuree than bacon.
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in total. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in total at the school. So, to find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:  Number of boys = 841 - 34 = 796  Therefore, there are 796 more boys than girls at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 232 girls and 485 students in total. So, the number of boys is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 boys at that school.
Response:  We know that there are 697 girls and the number of boys is less than 697 - 228 = 469. Therefore, there are 469 boys at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 635 girls and 510 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students, we get: Total number of students = Number of girls + (Number of boys - Number of girls) = 635 + (510 - 635) = 485 Therefore, there are 485 boys at the school.
Response:  If there are 868 girls and the remaining students are boys, then the number of boys is equal to the total number of students minus the number of girls. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of Boys = Total Students - Number of Girls  Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of Boys = 868 + (Total Students - 868)  Simplifying this equation, we get: Number of Boys = Total Students - 868  Therefore, there are 590 boys at that school.
Response:  We know that there are 700 girls and 142 more boys than girls in the school. So, if we add these numbers together, we get 842 students in total (700 + 142 = 842). Therefore, there are 842 students at this school.
Response:  We know that there are currently 706 girls in the school and 222 boys. If 418 more girls join the school, then the total number of girls will be 706 + 418 = 1124 girls. Similarly, if 418 more boys join the school, then the total number of boys will be 222 + 418 = 640 boys. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 1124 + 640 = 1764 students.
Response:  We know that initially there were 902 girls and 811 boys in the school. If 44 more girls joined the school, then the total number of girls would be 902 + 44 = 946 girls. So, the number of girls in the school is 946.
Response:  We know that initially there were 632 girls and 410 boys in the school. Then, 465 more girls joined the school. So, now the total number of girls is: 632 + 465 = 1097 girls. Now we need to find out how many boys are left in the school after the addition of new girls. The initial number of boys was 410, so the updated number of boys is: 410 - (Number of new girls / Total number of students) = 410 - (465/1097) = 410 - 0.42 = 368 boys. Therefore, there are 1097 girls more than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. Then, 682 more girls joined, so the total number of girls is now: 732 + 682 = 1414 girls. Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 135 girls and 214 boys in total at the school. So, if 496 girls came to school, then the number of girls who did not come to school is: 496 - 135 = 361. Similarly, if 910 boys came to school, then the number of boys who did not come to school is: 910 - 214 = 706. Therefore, there are 706 boys currently attending school.
Response:  We know that there are 308 girls and 318 boys in the school. So, together they make up 626 students (308 + 318). Now we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are at the school overall. There are 36 teachers, so the total number of people at the school is 626 + 36 = 662. Therefore, there are 662 students and 36 teachers at the school.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now we need to add the number of teachers to find out how many people are at the school overall. According to the problem, there are 772 teachers at the school. Therefore, the total number of people at the school is 624 (students) + 772 (teachers) = 1396.
"Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys in this school. So if there are x boys, then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 402 = 739
Now let's solve for x using subtraction:
x = 739 - 402
x = 337
So there are 337 boys at that school."
Response:  We know that there are more girls than boys at the school. So, if there are x boys, then there are x + 458 girls. Therefore, the total number of students is equal to x + 458. Since there are 692 girls in total, we can set up the equation: x + 458 = 692. Solving for x, we get: x = 374. So, there are 374 boys and 692 girls at the school.
Response:  We know that initially there were 257 girls and 362 boys in the school. So, the total number of students was 362 + 257 = 629. Now, we are told that 403 more girls have been added to the school. Therefore, the updated number of girls is 257 + 403 = 660. The difference between the number of girls and boys is: 660 - 362 = 318. So, there are 318 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  Edward had $18 and he gave away $16. So now he has $18 - $16 = $2 left. Therefore, Edward has $2 in his pocket.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward started with $ 13. Then he gave away some money and now has $ 3 left. So, the amount of money he gave away is equal to his original amount minus what he has left. Therefore, the answer is $ 10 ( $ 13 - $ 3).
Response:  Before Ed gave away $ 8, he had $ 9 - $ 8 = $ 1 left. So, Edward had $ 1 before he gave away his money.
"Response:  Before Edwar... (read more)

Solution:
Let's think step by step. Before Edward spent his money, he had $16. If each book cost him the same amount of money, then he must have spent all of his initial $16 to buy the 92 books. Therefore, he has $0 left after spending the money. So, the answer is $0."
Response:  If Edward gave $6 to buy two books, that means each book cost him half of the amount he gave, or $3 per book. So, each book costs $3.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Edward gave $6 for books and $16 for pens. So he has spent a total of $6 + $16 = $22. Now, we are told that he has $19 left after spending money on books and pens. Therefore, before he spent any money, Edward had $19 - $22 = -$3.
Response:  We know that Edward gave $4 for books and $3 for pens. So he has spent a total of $4 + $3 = $7. Therefore, Edward has given away $7.
Response:  We know that Edward gave $16 for books and $8 for pens. So he has spent a total of $24 ($16 + $8). Now we are asked how much more he has given to books than to pens. To find this difference, we subtract the amount he gave for pens from the total amount he spent: $24 - $8 = $16. Therefore, Edward has given $16 more to books than to pens.
Response:  Before Ed gave away his money, he had $ 17. Then, his friend gave him $ 10. So now Edward has $ 27 ($ 17 + $ 10). Finally, he spent $ 7, so he is left with $ 20 ($ 27 - $ 7). Therefore, Edward had $ 17 before giving away his money.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did 58 more than Zachary. So, David did 58 + 44 = 102 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary and David together did 44 + 102 = 146 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zachary did: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David has done 44 push-ups and he did 9 more than Zachary. So, if we subtract 9 from 44, we get 35. Therefore, Zachary has done 35 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David has done 51 push-ups and he did 49 more than Zachary. So, Zachary did 51 - 49 = 2 push-ups. Therefore, David and Zachary together have done 51 + 2 = 53 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 59 push-ups and 44 crunches. If David did more than Zachary, then he must have done at least 59 push-ups as well. So let's assume that David did 60 push-ups. Now we can calculate how many crunches David did by subtracting the number of crunches Zachary did from the total number of crunches. Therefore, David did 44 - 44 = 0 crunches.  So, David did 60 push-ups and 0 crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 17 crunches and David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if we subtract the number of push-ups that David did from the total number of crunches that Zachary did, we will get the number of crunches that David did. Therefore, the answer is:  Crunches done by David = Total crunches done by Zachary - Number of push-ups done by David = 17 + (44 - 29) = 18
Response:  We know that Zachary has done 53 push-ups and 14 crunches. If David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, then Zachary did 53 - 17 = 36 push-ups. Similarly, if David did 10 fewer crunches than Zachary, then Zachary did 14 + 10 = 24 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 36 push-ups and 24 crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches. If we subtract 3 from the number of push-ups, we get 32. So far so good! Now let's look at what David did. He did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, which means he did 58 + 32 = 90 push-ups. But he also did 87 fewer crunches than Zachary, which means he did 3 (the number of crunches Zachary did) - 87 = 34 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did more push-ups than crunches.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 58 crunches and David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did x crunches, then David did x + 38 crunches. Since David did fewer crunches than Zachary, we can say that x > 58. Therefore, Zachary did more crunches than David.
"Response:  We know that David did more than Zachary because he is mentioned first in the sentence ""David deed 39 meer push-ups dan Zachary"". So we can say that David did at least 39 + 19 = 58 push-ups. Since John did fewer push-ups than David, we can say that John did 58 - 13 = 45 push-ups. Therefore, David did 45 push-ups."
Response:  We know that Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 74 (since he did 22 more than Zachary). So far so good! Now we are told that John did four times fewer push-ups than David. That means John did 74 / 4 = 18 push-ups. Therefore, John did 18 push-ups today.
Response:  We know that David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 39 + X push-ups, where X is the number of push-ups Zachary did. Since John did 9 fewer push-ups than David, John did 39 - 9 = 30 push-ups. So, Zachary did more push-ups than John by 30 - 15 = 15 push-ups. Therefore, Zachary did 15 more push-ups than John.
Response:  If David did 30 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did x push-ups. Since David did 37 push-ups, we can set up an equation as follows: 37 = 30 + x. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. So, Zachary did 7 push-ups at the sports school today.
Response:  If David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, that means Zachary did x push-ups. Since David did 38 push-ups, we can write an equation: 56 = x + 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 18. So, together, David and Zachary did 18 + 38 = 56 push-ups.
Response:  We know that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary (so he did 40 + x = 57 push-ups). However, we also know that David did 17 fewer crunches than Zachary (so he did 62 - 17 = 45 crunches). Therefore, David did 45 crunches.
"Response:  We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary and 33 fewer crunches than Zachary. So if Zachary did x push-ups and y crunches, then we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 36 = y - 33

Now we need to solve for y (the number of crunches Zachary did). To do this, we can subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:

y = x - 36

So if Zachary did x push-ups, he did x - 36 crunches. Since we don't have any information about how many push-ups or crunches Zachary actually did, we cannot determine the exact value of x. However, we can conclude that Zachary did more crunches than push-ups because he had more crunches than David did."
"Response:  We know that Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. So, we can write this as:
Zachary = 5 + 17 = 22
Now, we are told that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 5 push-ups, then David did 27 + 5 = 32 push-ups.
We also know that David did 7 fewer crunches than Zachary. So, if Zachary did 17 crunches, then David did 17 - 7 = 10 crunches.
Therefore, the difference between the number of crunches and push-ups done by Zachary and David is:
Difference = 10 - (22 - 5) = 10 - 17 = -7
So, Zachary did 7 more crunches than push-ups he did."
Response:  If Rachel made five pages of math homework and two pages of reading homework, then she made a total of 7 pages of homework (5 + 2 = 7). So, she had more math homework than reading homework.
Response:  Rachel has to make 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. So, in total she needs to make 3 + 4 = 7 pages of homework. Therefore, Rachel has more reading homework than math homework.
Response:  If Rachel had to make five pages of math homework and more pages of reading homework, that means she has already made seven pages of homework (five for math + more for reading). So if she needs to make seven more pages of homework, then she will have to make ten pages in total (seven pages she already made + three additional pages).
Response:  If Rachel had to make seven pages of math homework and she needs to make four more pages than that means she needs to make 7 + 4 = 11 pages of math homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel had already made 8 pages of math homework and she needs to make 3 more pages than that means she needs to make a total of 11 pages (8 + 3 = 11).
Response:  If Rachel had to make 8 pages of math homework and she read 6 more pages than math, then she must have read 14 pages in total (8 + 6 = 14).
Response:  If Rachel had to make 10 pages of math homework and she had to read 3 more pages than math, then she would have to make 13 pages of homework in total.
Response:  Rachel has to make 2 pages of math homework and read 3 pages of science homework. So far, she needs to fill out 5 pages (2 + 3). Then, she also needs to write 10 pages of biology homework, which brings the total number of pages to 15 (5 + 10). Therefore, Rachel must complete 15 pages of homework in total.
Response:  If Rachel has to make 9 pages of math homework and she reads 2 pages of reading comprehension homework, then she has to make 7 pages more of math homework than reading homework (9 - 2 = 7). So, Rachel has to make 7 + 9 = 16 pages of math homework in total.
"Response:  If Rachel has to make 11 pages of homework in total and she reads 2 pages of math homework and 3 pages of biology homework, then we can calculate how many more pages of math homework she has to do as follows:

Total number of pages = 11
Number of pages read = 2 + 3 = 5
So, there are 6 pages of math homework left to be done (11 - 5 = 6)."
Response:  Rachel has to make 7 pages of math homework and read 11 pages of science homework. In total, she needs to make 7 + 11 = 18 pages of homework. However, she also needs to read 8 pages of biology homework, which is more than the amount of homework she needs to make. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of homework she needs to make and the number of pages of biology homework she needs to read is 18 - 8 = 10 pages. So, Rachel has 10 more pages of homework in biology than she needs to make.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to make 9 pages of math homework and she also has to read 11 pages of reading homework. So far so good! However, we are not done yet because there is still more homework for her to do in both subjects. In total, Rachel needs to complete 9 + 11 = 20 pages of homework.
Response:  We know that Rachel has to make 8 pages of math homework and she read 7 pages of science homework. So far so good! But then we are told that she also had to do 3 pages of biology homework. Therefore, in total, Rachel had to make/do:  Math homework = 8 pages x 1 page per task = 8 tasks Biology homework = 3 pages x 1 page per task = 3 tasks Total number of tasks = 8 + 3 = 11 tasks Now, each task usually takes around 30-45 minutes to complete (depending on the complexity of the task). So, the total time it took Rachel to finish all her homework can be estimated as follows: Time taken for math homework = Number of tasks x Time per task = 8 x 30-45 minutes = 240-360 minutes Time taken for biology homework = Number of tasks x Time per task = 3 x 30-45 minutes = 90-135 minutes Total time taken for both subjects = Time taken for math + Time taken for biology = 240-360 minutes + 90-135 minutes = 330-495 minutes
"Response:  We know that Rachel has to make five pages of math homework and ten pages of reading homework. So far so good! However, we also know that she needs to complete six pages of biology homework. Therefore, in total, Rachel needs to do:

5 + 10 = 15 pages of homework (math and reading)
+ 6 = 21 pages of homework (biology)
So, Rachel needs to finish 21 pages of homework in total."
Response:  Rachel has to make two pages of homework for reading and four pages of math homework. So, in total she needs to make 6 pages of homework (2 + 4 = 6).
Response:  We know that Rachel has to make 4 pages of homework in total and she made 7 pages of math homework. So far so good! Now we need to find out how many more pages of math homework she had than reading homework. To do this, we can subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework. In this case, the difference is 7 - 4 = 3 pages. Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and in the afternoon he received 2 emails. So, we can say that the number of emails Jack received in the morning is 6. Now, let's compare this with the number of emails he received in the afternoon, which is 2. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received in the morning and those he received in the afternoon is 6 - 2 = 4. So, Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received six emails in the morning and eight emails in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows:  6 + x = 8 (where x is the number of emails he received in the afternoon) Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:  6 + x - 6 = 8 Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us: x = 2 Therefore, Jack received two more emails in the afternoon than he did in the morning.
Response:  If Jack received 4 emails in the morning and he receives 5 emails per day, then he must have received a total of 9 emails that day (4 + 5 = 9). So, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon (9 - 5 = 2).
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails. In the afternoon, he received 3 emails. And in the evening, he received 5 emails. So, how many emails did Jack receive per day? To find out, we need to add up all the emails he received: 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails per day. Therefore, Jack received 14 emails per day.
Response:  In the morning (08:00 - 12:00), Jack received 5 emails. Therefore, he has received 5 emails in the morning.  In the afternoon (13:00 - 17:00), Jack received 8 emails. So, he has received 8 emails in the afternoon. Finally, in the evening (19:00 - 23:00), Jack received 72 emails. Thus, he has received 72 emails in the evening.  Therefore, the total number of emails that Jack has received is: 5 + 8 + 72 = 95 emails.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 4 emails. In the afternoon, he received 5 emails. So, the total number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon is 4 + 5 = 9. Finally, in the evening, he received 8 emails. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received during all three time periods is 9 + 8 = 17.
Response:  Morning = 3 emails and Afternoon = 4 emails. So in total, Jack has received 3 + 4 = 7 emails during morning and afternoon hours. Evening = 8 emails. Therefore, Jack has received 7 + 8 = 15 emails in total.
"Response:  In the morning (morgens), Jack received 10 emails.  In the afternoon (middags), he received 7 emails.  And in the evening (avonds), he received 17 emails. So, we can calculate how many emails Jack received more in the morning than in the afternoon as follows:  
Morning (morgens): 10 emails  
Afternoon (middags): 7 emails  
Difference = |10 - 7| = 3 emails  
Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon."
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails in the evening. So, we can calculate the total number of emails he received as follows: Morning + Afternoon = Total Number of Emails 9 + 10 = 19 Therefore, Jack's morning received more emails than his evening.
Response:  In total, Jack received 10 emails in the morning, 5 emails in the afternoon and 4 emails in the evening. So, we can write an equation: Morning = 10 Emails Afternoon = 5 Emails Evening = 4 Emails Now, let's compare how many emails Jack got during the afternoons with those he got during the evenings: Afternoon - Evening =? To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of emails Jack got in the afternoon (5) from the number of emails he got in the evening (4): 5 - 4 = 1 Therefore, Jack's middays had more emails than his evenings.
Response:  If Jack received six emails in the morning and three in the afternoon, then he received a total of nine emails during the day (6 + 3 = 9).  Therefore, if he received ten emails per day, he would have received 9 x 10 = 90 emails that day.
Response:  Jack received 5 emails and 54 letters in the afternoon. So he received a total of 5 + 54 = 59 messages that day. Since we are asked how many emails Jack received per day, we can divide the number of emails he received overall (59) by the time period during which he received them (one day). Therefore, Jack received an average of 59 / 1 = 59 emails per day.
Response:  We know that Jack received 9 emails and 7 letters. So, in total he received 9 + 7 = 16 messages. Now we are asked how many letters Jack received on one day. Since we know that he received 7 letters, the answer is 7.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 44 emails in the afternoon. So, he received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning. The difference between the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon is:  3 - 44 = -41 emails. Therefore, Jack's morning received fewer emails than his afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 2 emails and 7 letters. So he had 9 messages in total (2 emails + 7 letters).  In the afternoon, Jack received 2 more emails and 5 more letters. Therefore, in the afternoon, Jack had 14 messages in total (2 new emails + 5 new letters = 7 messages).  Now we need to find out how many letters Jack got in the morning compared to the afternoon. To do this, we divide the number of letters Jack got in the morning by the number of letters he got in the afternoon:  Number of letters in the morning / Number of letters in the afternoon = 7 / 14 = 0.5 (or half)  So, Jack got half as many letters in the morning as he did in the afternoon.
Response:  We know that Jack received 6 emails and sent 91 letters. So he sent 91 - 2 = 89 letters per day. Since we are asked how many emails Jack received per day, we can divide the number of emails he received (6) by the number of days he was active (the time period during which he received those emails). Therefore, Jack received 6 / x = 6 emails per day, where x is the unknown variable representing the length of the time period during which Jack was active.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received 6 emails and sent 2 letters. So he had 6 + 2 = 8 messages to handle that day.  In the afternoon, Jack received 4 emails and sent 8 letters. Therefore, he handled 8 + 8 = 16 messages that day. Since we are asked how many emails Jack sent per day, we can conclude that he sent 8 emails per day.
Response:  If Jack received 7 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon, then he has received a total of 7 + x emails in the day where x is the number of emails he received in the afternoon. So, we can write an equation as follows: 9 = 7 + x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 9 - 7 = x. Simplifying, we get: x = 2. Therefore, Jack has received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  In the morning, Jack received three emails.  In the afternoon, he received five emails. So, if we subtract the number of emails he got in the morning from the total number of emails he got in the afternoon, we get:  5 - 3 = 2 more emails in the afternoon than in the morning. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  If Jack received three emails in the afternoon and six emails in the morning, then he received a total of nine emails during the day (three + six = nine).  If he receives ten emails per day on average, then he would have received 9 x 10 = 90 emails that day.
Response:  The sprinkhaan (or frog) jumped 12 inches and the frog (or toad) jumped 9 inches. So, we can say that the distance between the two is equal to the difference of their jumps. Therefore, the distance between them is:  12 - 9 = 3 inches.
Response:  The sprinkhaan sprang 31 inches and the frog sprang 35 inches. So together they have sprung 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
Response:  The sprinkhaan sprang 36 inches (or 91 cm). Then, the kikker sprang further than the sprinkhaan, which means it sprang 36 inches + X cm, where X is the distance the kikker sprang beyond the sprinkhaan. Since the kikker sprang 17 centimeters more than the sprinkhaan, we can write:  36 inches + 0.17 feet = X cm    Therefore, the kikker sprang 38.4 feet (or 11.7 meters) beyond the sprinkhaan. Finally, the mouse sprang 15 centimeters beyond the kikker, so it sprang 38.4 feet + 0.15 meters = 38.55 meters beyond the sprinkhaan.
Response:  The sprinkhaan sprang 25 inches (63 cm). Then, the kikker sprang 18 cm further than the sprinkhaan, so it sprang 43 cm (63 - 20 = 43). Finally, the muis sprang 2 cm further than the kikker, so it sprang 41 cm (43 - 2 = 41). Therefore, the muis sprang 41 cm (or 13.4 feet) away from its starting point.
Response:  The sprinkhaan sprang 19 inches (48 cm). Then, the kikker sprang 10 cm further than that, which is 58 cm (23 in). Finally, the mouse sprang 20 cm further than the kikker, which is 78 cm (31 in) away from the starting point. So, the distance between the starting point and where the mouse ended up is:  Distance = 78 - 58 = 20 cm (8 in)  Therefore, the mouse ended up 20 cm (8 in) farther away from the starting point than the sprinkhaan.
"Response:  The distance that the kikker jumped is equal to the sum of the distances that the other two animals jumped plus their own jump. So we can write an equation as follows:

Kikker = Sprinkhaan + Kikker - Muis

We know that the sprinkhaan jumped 19 inches and the mouse jumped 94 centimeters lower than the kikker. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows:

Kikker = 19 + (39 cm) - (94 cm)

Simplifying this equation gives us:

Kikker = 68 cm

Therefore, the kikker jumped 68 centimeters."
Response:  The mouse sprang $x$ inches lower than the frog. Since the frog sprang 32 cm, the mouse sprang $32 - x$ cm.  Now, we know that the mole sprang 25 inch, so the mouse sprang $\frac{32}{12} - \frac{25}{12} = 8 - 2 = 6$ inches less than the mole. Therefore, the mouse sprang $6 + x$ inches.
"Response:  The mouse (or ""muis"" in Dutch) jumped 15 cm lower than the frog (or ""kikker"" in Dutch). So if the frog jumped x cm, the mouse jumped x - 15 cm.  Therefore, the distance the mouse jumped is equal to the distance the frog jumped minus 15 cm.  In other words: x = y - 15.  Substituting y from the problem statement, we get: x = 24 - 15 = 9 cm.  So the mouse jumped 9 cm."
Response:  The grasshopper jumped 13 inches and then two centimeters further than that. So if we want to find out how far the frog jumped, we need to calculate the distance between the point where the grasshopper started and the point where it landed after its second jump. We know that the grasshopper jumped 13 inches initially, so let's call this distance x. Then, since the grasshopper jumped two centimeters further than that, the total distance it traveled is x + 2 cm = 15 cm (since there are 100 cm in 1 inch). Therefore, the frog jumped 15 cm.
Response:  The frog jumped 10 cm further than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 45 cm (10 + 35). Therefore, the total distance traveled by both insects is 45 cm + 35 cm = 80 cm.
"Response:  The distance that the frog jumped is equal to the sum of the distances that the grasshopper and the mouse jumped plus the distance that the frog jumped itself. So we can write:
Frog = Grasshopper + Mouse + Frog
We know that the grasshopper jumped 10 cm and the mouse jumped -15 cm. Therefore, we can write:
Frog = 10 + (-15) + x
where x is the distance that the frog jumped. Substituting this equation into the previous one, we get:
Frog = 10 + (-15) + x
x = 25
Therefore, the frog jumped 25 cm."
Response:  The mouse sprang 12 cm less than the frog and 19 cm more than the toad. So if the frog sprang 39 inches (or 99 cm), then the mouse sprang 39 - 12 = 27 inches (or 69 cm).
Response:  The distance that the frog jumped is given as 21 inches or 53 cm.  The mouse jumped 16 cm lower than the frog, so it jumped 53 - 16 = 37 cm. Therefore, the distance that the mouse jumped was 37 cm.
Response:  The kikker (frog) jumped 39 inches and the sprinkhaan (grasshopper) jumped 17 inches. To find out how far the frog jumped compared to the grasshopper, we can divide the distance the frog jumped by the distance the grasshopper jumped:  Distance frog jumped = 39 inches / Distance grasshopper jumped = 17 inches = 2.28 times as far   Therefore, the kikker (frog) jumped approximately 2.28 times farther than the sprinkhaan (grasshopper).
"Response:  The mouse (M) will jump less than the frog (F). So M = F - X, where X is the distance that the frog jumps more than the mouse. We know that the frog jumps 10 cm more than the mouse, so we can write:

M = F - (F - X)
= F - (F - 10cm)
= F - 9in
= 1in

So the mouse jumps 1 inch."
Response:  The mouse (M) sprang x cm less than the frog (F). So M = F - x.  The frog (F) sprang 37 cm further than the spring (S). So S + F = 59 cm. Now we know that M = F - x and S + F = 59 cm. Solving for x, we get: x = 20 cm. Therefore, the mouse sprang 20 cm less than the spring.
Response:  We know that the recipe asks for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.  Since Mary has already added 5 cups of flour (which means she has used 9 cups of flour so far), we need to subtract 9 from 14 to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add:  14 - 9 = 5. So, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour. Similarly, since she has already added 6 cups of sugar, she doesn't need to add any more sugar. Therefore, the correct answer is 5 cups of flour more than what the recipe asked for.
Response:  We know that the recipe asks for 9 copes of flour and 11 cups of sugar.  If Mary has already added 4 cups of flour, then she needs to add 5 more cups of sugar (11 - 4 = 7). So, Mary needs to add 7 additional cups of sugar.
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour and needs 8 more cups to complete the recipe, then she will need to add an additional 8 / 6 = 1 1/3 cups of flour. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 1/3 cups.
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour to the dough and the recipe asks for 11 cups of flour total, then she needs 2 more cups of flour. So, if she has already added x cups of flour, then she needs 2 + x cups of flour in total. Since there are 7 cups of sugar needed, we can set up the equation: 2 + x = 7. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, Mary has added 5 cups of flour to the dough.
"Response:  We know that the recipe requires 11 copes of sugar and ""a little bit"" of flour.  If Mary has already added three cups of flour, then she still needs to add six more cups. So, the total amount of flour needed for the recipe is 9 cups (11 - 3 = 9)."
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour to the dough and the recipe asks for 12 cups of flour total, then she needs 7 more cups (12 - 5 = 7). So, if she has already added 2 cups of flour, she still needs 5 cups (7 - 2 = 5) more. Therefore, Mary has added 5 cups of flour to the dough.
"Response:  We know that we need to add 4 more cop...

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  We know that we need to add 4 more copies of meal to make 9 total. So if Mary has already added 3 copies of meal, she needs to add 1 more copy. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 additional copy of meal to her recipe."
"Response:  We know that we need to add 14 - (2 =) 12 more cop...

Question: Mary is een taart aan het bakken. Het recept vraagt om 5 kopjes meel en 14 kopjes suiker. She has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. How many cups of sugar must she add now?

Answer: To find out how many cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the amount of sugar she has already added from the total amount of sugar required in the recipe. The recipe asks for 14 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 2 cups, so she needs to add an additional 12 cups of sugar."
Response:  We know that we need to add 6 more cups of flour ( since there are 12 cups in total and Mary has already added 11). So, we need to add 6 more cups of flour. Therefore, the answer is 6.
Response:  We know that we need to add more flour than sugar and salt. So, if we have already added 7 cups of flour (which is half of what the recipe asks for), then we must add at least an additional 3 cups of flour (since there are 4 times as much flour as sugar in the recipe). Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is 7 + 3 = 10 cups.  Since each cup of flour corresponds to twice as much sugar and salt, we can calculate the total amount of sugar and salt needed as follows:  Sugar: 2 x 10 = 20 cups Salt: 2 x 10 = 20 cups In summary, Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour, 20 cups of sugar, and 20 cups of salt to her tart dough.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cup of flour (meel in Dutch) and the recipe asks for 12 cups total. So we need to find out how many cups more flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the number of cups she has already added from the total amount needed: 12 - 2 = 10. Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10 cups of flour. Similarly, we can calculate the amount of sugar and salt needed by subtracting the amount she has already added from the total amount required: 14 - 2 = 12 and 7 - 2 = 5 respectively.
"Response:  We know that Mary has already added five cups of flour (6/5 = 1.2). Now we need to find out how many more cups of sugar and salt she needs to add. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Sugar = Total amount - Amount already added / Number of cups already added
Salt = Total amount - Amount already added / Number of cups already added

In this case, the total amount of sugar is 8 cups (the original recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar), and the number of cups already added is 5 (since Mary has added 5 cups of flour). So, to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can plug these values into the formula like this:

Sugar = 8 - (5 / 5) = 3

Similarly, the total amount of salt is also 8 cups (just like the sugar), and the number of cups already added is again 5. Using the same formula as before, we get:

Salt = 8 - (5 / 5) = 3

Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 3 cups of sugar and 3 cups of salt to her mixture in order to follow the recipe correctly."
Response:  We know that we need to add 13 - 2 = 11 more tablespoons of sugar to the recipe. So, Mary needs to add 11 more tablespoons of sugar to her mixture.
Response:  We know that the recipe asks for 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar.  Since Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar, she needs to add an additional 5 cups of flour (9 - 4 = 5). So, the final amount of flour needed is 5 cups.
Response:  We know that we need to add more than twice as much flour as sugar. So if there are 6 cups of sugar, then we need to add at least 12 cups of flour (twice 6). But since Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, she needs to add another 10 cups (12 - 2 = 10). Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 10 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 11 cups of flour (meel) to her tart dough. The recipe calls for a total of 16 cups of flour and sugar. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than flour Mary needs to add.  To do this, we can divide the number of cups of sugar required by the number of cups of flour she has already added:  Number of cups of sugar = Total amount of sugar / Amount of flour already added  = 16 / 11 = 3 + 2 = 5 additional cups of sugar  Therefore, Mary needs to add an additional 5 cups of sugar to her tart dough.
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour (5 copies), and the recipe asks for 10 copies of flour, then she still needs to add an additional 5 copies of flour (since she has already added 5). So, the total number of copies of flour that Mary will have added to her mixture is 5 + 10 = 15.
Response:  If Mary has already added some flour (12 copies), and the recipe asks for 13 copies of flour, then she still needs to add 1 copy more. So, the answer is 13.
Response:  We know that we need to add 9 more copes of flour (since there are 9 less than asked for). So, we need 9 + 7 = 16 copies of flour in total. Therefore, Mary needs to add 16 - 7 = 9 more copies of flour.
Response:  We know that the recipe asks for 11 copes of sugar and 9 copies of flour.  Mary has already added 10 copies of sugar and 12 copies of flour to the tart. So we need to find out how many more copies of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the number of copies of sugar she has already added from the total amount needed (11 - 10 = 1). Therefore, Mary needs to add one more copy of sugar to the tart.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added six copies of meal to the dough. So we need to find out how many more copies she needs to add to make three times the amount requested in the recipe.  Three times ten equals thirty. So Mary needs to add an additional twenty-four copies of flour (thirty - six = twenty-four). Therefore, Mary must add another twelve copies of flour (twenty-four / two = twelve) to complete the recipe.

Question: Mary is an excellent baker and she wants to make a cake for her friend's birthday party. She has all the ingredients except for 2 cups of flour. How many cups of flour does she need to buy to make sure she has enough to make the cake?  Based on the information provided in the question, what would be the best answer?  Answer:  To determine how many cups of flour Mary needs to buy, we can use the recipe given in the question. The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour, so if Mary doesn't have any flour, she will need to buy 2 cups (since 2 x 3 = 6). Therefore, the best answer is 2 cups of flour."
Response:  We know that Mary has already added two cup of flour (meel) and she needs to add more than two cups of salt. So, we can calculate how many cups of flour she needs to add by subtracting the number of cups of salt from the total amount of flour required in the recipe. In this case, the recipe requires 7 + 4 = 11 cups of flour. Since Mary has already added 2 cups of flour, she needs to add an additional 9 cups of flour (11 - 2 = 9). Therefore, the answer is 9 cups of flour.
Response:  We know that we have to add more sugar than salt because the recipe asks for 11 copes of sugar and only 9 copies of salt. So if we added 9 copies of salt, we would need to add 2 more copies of sugar (11 - 9 = 2). Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 extra spoons of sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 4 cups of sugar to the tart and the recipe calls for 7 cups in total. So we need to find out how many more cups she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (7 cups) by the amount of sugar she has already added (4 cups): 7 / 4 = 1.75 cups. Since you cannot have a fraction of a cup, Mary needs to add an additional 1 cup of sugar to the tart.
Response:  We know that Mary has already added 10 copes of sugar (10 x 12 = 120 grams) and now she needs to add more meal. The recipe asks for 14 copies of flour, so we need to subtract the amount of sugar from the total amount of ingredients to find out how much meal Mary should add. Therefore, the number of copies of meal that Mary must add is equal to the difference between the total amount of ingredients and the amount of sugar she has already added, which is 14 - 12 = 2. So, Mary needs to add 2 cups of meal.
Response:  We know that 19 bird families live near the mountain during winter and 60 bird families migrate for winter. So, if 60 bird families migrate for winter, then there are 19 - 60 = 41 bird families left behind at the mountain. Therefore, 41 bird families would fly away for the winter.
"Response:  If there are 87 bird families near the mountain and 7 of them migrate for the winter, then the number of bird families that remain behind can be calculated as follows:

Number of bird families remaining = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that migrated
= 87 - 7
= 80

Therefore, 80 bird families remained behind after 7 families migrated for the winter."
Response:  We know that 20 bird families migrated away for the winter and 14 bird families stayed near the mountain. So, if we subtract the number of birds that left from the total number of birds living nearby the mountain, we get: Total number of birds = Number of birds that stayed x (1 - Migration rate) Where migration rate is the percentage of birds that migrate away for the winter. For example, if 50% of the birds in the area migrate away for the winter, then the migration rate would be 0.5 or 50%. Now let's plug in the numbers: Total number of birds = 14 x (1 - 0.5) = 70 birds Therefore, there are approximately 70 bird families living near the mountain.
"Response:  We know that 23 bird families went to Africa and 37 bird families went to Asia. So, we have:
Africa = 23 bird families x 85 bird families near the mountain = 1905 birds
Asia = 37 bird families x 85 bird families near the mountain = 3195 birds
Now, let's subtract the number of birds that left for Africa from the total number of birds near the mountain:
Total number of birds near the mountain - Number of birds that left for Africa = Total number of birds near the mountain - 1905 = 6645 birds
Therefore, there were 6645 bird families remaining near the mountain after some birds migrated to Africa and Asia."
Response:  We know that 8 bird families live near the mountain during winter. If 42 bird families went to Africa and 31 went to Asia, then we can conclude that 42 - 31 = 11 bird families went to Africa. Therefore, 11 bird families went to Africa.
"Response:  We know that 94 vogelfamilies went to Asia and 47 vogelfamilies went to Africa. So, we have:
Asia - 94 families = 94 x (number of families) = 940 families
Africa - 47 families = 47 x (number of families) = 470 families
Therefore, there were 510 vogelfamilies that flew to Asia and 360 vogelfamilies that flew to Africa."
Response:  We know that 18 bird families live near the mountain and they don't migrate for the winter. So, their number remains constant at 18. Now, let's calculate how many bird families migrated to Africa and Asia. From the question, we know that 38 bird families migrated to Africa and 80 bird families migrated to Asia. Therefore, the total number of bird families that migrated for the winter is:  38 + 80 = 118. So, there are 118 fewer bird families living near the mountain than before the migration.
Response:  If there are already 87 bird families living near the mountain and summer is approaching, it means that these birds will migrate to cooler areas. So, we need to subtract 87 from the total number of bird families that might come back to the mountain after migration.    Now, let's consider the new bird families coming to the mountain. The question states that 18 new bird families arrived at the mountain. Therefore, the total number of bird families living near the mountain now is equal to the original number minus the number of migrating bird families plus the number of newly arrived bird families.   Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows: Total Number of Bird Families = Original Number - Migrated Number + Newly Arrived Number. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Total Number of Bird Families = 87 - 87 + 18 = 63. Therefore, there are 63 bird families living near the mountain now.
Response:  We know that 59 vogelfamilies flew away before winter and 24 new vogelfamilies came from the north pole area to live at the mountain. So, the total number of vogelfamilies at the mountain now is: 59 + 24 = 83 vogelfamilies. Therefore, there are 83 vogelfamilies left behind at the mountain.
Response:  We know that 27 bird families flew away for the winter from a mountain. If there were 41 bird families living near the mountain before they left, then after they left, there are 41 - 27 = 14 bird families still living near the mountain. Therefore, there are 14 bird families still living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that there are 86 bird families that migrate for the winter and we also know that 45 of these families live near the mountain. So, if we subtract the number of families that live near the mountain from the total number of families that migrate, we get the number of families that migrated away from the mountain. Therefore, the answer is 41 (86 - 45).
Response:  We know that 35 bird families went to Asia and 62 bird families went to Africa. So, if we subtract the number of birds that went to Asia from the total number of bird families near the mountain (41), we get the number of bird families that went to Africa: 41 - 35 = 7. Therefore, 7 bird families went to Africa.
Response:  We know that 3 bird families live near the mountain and 26 new bird families came from the north pole to join them during the winter. So, in total, there are 3 + 26 = 29 bird families living near the mountain during the winter. Therefore, the number of bird families that stayed behind in their original territory is 29 - 2 = 27.
Response:  At first, Paul received 253 color pencils for his birthday. Then he lost or gave away 70 of them at the end of the school year. So, how many did he have left? We can calculate it as follows:  Number of color pencils Paul had at the beginning = 253 - Number of color pencils Paul lost or gave away at the end = 70 Therefore, the number of color pencils Paul had left at the end of the school year is:  Number of color pencils Paul had left = 253 - 70 = 183
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 551 color pencils and lost or gave away some during the year. At the end of the year, he was left with 177. So, if we want to find out how many color pencils Paul got for his birthday, we can subtract the number he already had from the total number he started with: 551 - 177 = 374. Therefore, Paul received 374 color pencils for his birthday.
Response:  If Paul gave away 111 of his 440 color pencils to his friends and lost 106 in total, then he must have had 224 left (440 - 111 - 106 = 224). So, he still has 224 color pencils with him.
Response:  We know that Paul received 65 color pencils as a gift and gave away 213 to his friends. So far so good! However, we are also told that he lost or gave away 16 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils that Paul had at one point is: 65 - 16 = 49.
Response:  If Paul gave away 571 potatoes and lost 161, then he had initially 589 - 161 = 428 potatoes. So, he gave away more than he lost! Therefore, the answer is 571 - 161 = 410 more potatoes that he gave away than he lost.
Response:  If Paul had 110 color pencils in total and gave away 90 of them to his friends, then he has 20 left (110 - 90 = 20). Now, if he lost 412 pencils, that means he has 632 pencils remaining (412 + 20 = 632). So, he has more pencils now than he had before he gave some away. Therefore, he has lost more pencils than he gave away. The difference between the number of pencils he lost and the number he gave away is 412 - 90 = 322 pencils.
Response:  If Paul gave away 563 potatoes and lost 558, then he has 332 left. Now, if he received 332 colorful potatoes as gift for his birthday, that means he got 332 - 558 = 174 more than he initially had. So, he received 174 kreefish for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 52 potatoes and lost or gave away 535 potatoes. So, if he started with 492 potatoes (the number given in the question), then he must have had 492 - 52 = 440 potatoes left after giving away 52 potatoes. Then, he lost or gave away an additional 535 - 440 = 95 potatoes. Therefore, there were 95 potatoes lost or given away.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 521 colored pencils and 66 white ones. If he lost or gave away some during the year without realizing it, then at the end of the year he would have fewer than 521 colored pencils and fewer than 66 white ones. How many fewer? Well, if we subtract 154 from 521, we get 367 remaining colored pencils. Similarly, if we subtract 154 from 66, we get 51 white pencils remaining. So, in total, Paul lost or gave away 367 colored pencils and 51 white pencils throughout the year.
Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 531 color pencils and 38 gummies in a box. Then he used some of them without losing any (he didn't use any wiskram). So, after using some of them, he had 531 - 0 = 531 left. At the end of the school year, he had 391 left, so we can subtract the number he had at the beginning from the number he had at the end to find out how many he had left at the end: 531 - 391 = 140. Therefore, Paul had 140 color pencils left in the box at the end of the school year.
"Response:  We know that at first, Paul had 601 color pencils and 406 gummies in his box. Then he lost some without using them (he didn't lose any pencils). At the end of the school year, he had 336 left. So, we can calculate how many he had initially as follows:

Total = Initial + Lost
= 601 + (406 - x)
where x is the number of gummies he lost during the school year. Solving for x, we get:
x = 295
So, Paul has 295 gummies left in his box."
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 315 color pencils in his box. Then he lost or gave away 315 - 291 = 24 pencils during the school year. So, he received 291 - 24 = 267 color pencils for his birthday.
Response:  We know that Paul received 267 color pencils as a gift and lost 231 of them. So he has 36 (267 - 231) left with him. Now, he gave away 308 color pencils to his friends. Therefore, the difference between the number of pencils he gave away and the number he had left is: 308 - 36 = 272. So, he gave away 272 more pencils than he had initially.
Response:  We know that at the beginning of the year, Paul had 457 gummies and 320 colorful pencils in his box. If he didn't lose any during the year, then he must have received 169 new pencils (457 - 320 = 169). So now he has 457 + 169 = 626 items in total. At the end of the year, he only lost 523 - 626 = -103 items. Therefore, Paul still has -103 pencils left in his box.
Response:  At first, the Ober had 11 customers. If he served them and they left, then he had 3 customers remaining. So, there are more customers who left than those who remained. Therefore, the number of customers who left is equal to the number of customers who remained minus 3 (customers). In other words, the difference between the total number of customers and the number of customers remaining is equal to 3. Thus, the answer is 3.
Response:  The Ober had three customers initially. After two departures, he still has four customers left. So, there are 3 - 2 = 1 customer remaining. Therefore, one customer remained behind.
Response:  When he started working, the Ober had 0 customers (since he just began). Then, after serving 9 customers, he still has 12 customers left. So, in total, he served 9 + 12 = 21 customers. Therefore, when he started working, he had 0 customers.
Response:  If an Ober has 14 customers and there are still five customers left, then we can deduce that the Ober has 9 fewer customers than he initially had (since 5 is less than 14). So, if the Ober initially had X customers, then he now has X - 9 = 6 customers remaining.
Response:  At first, the Ober had 13 customers. Then he lost some customers and gained new ones. So let's say he had x fewer customers after losing some. Now he has 4 new customers, so his total number of customers is x + 4. Since he still had 9 customers initially, we can write an equation: x + 4 = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 5. Therefore, there were 5 customers left after the Ober lost some and gained new ones.
Response:  At first, the Ober had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, so he had 12 - 15 = -3 customers. But then, 14 new customers arrived, so now he has +14 = 11 customers. Therefore, the Ober has 11 customers now.
Response:  At first, the Ober had three customers. Then more people arrived and he had eight customers in total. So, new customers are equal to 8 - 3 = 5.
Response:  The Ober initially has 8 customers. After a few departures, he still has 5 customers left. Then, he gets 99 new customers. So, we need to find out how many customers are left after adding all these numbers together. We can do this by using basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.  First, let's calculate the total number of customers the Ober has at any given time: Total Customers = Initial Customers + Departing Customers + New Customers - Subtract the initial customers who have already departed from the total number of new customers. In this case, the Ober initially has 8 customers, then loses 3 (since there were 3 departures), gains 99 new customers, and subtracts the 5 remaining customers from the total number of new customers. Therefore, the final number of customers the Ober has is: Final Number of Customers = 8 + (-3) + 99 - 5 = 106 customers. So, there are 106 customers left for the Ober.
Response:  At first, the Ober has 12 customers. After some departures, he still has 14 customers. Then, he gets 10 new customers. So, now he has 14 + 10 = 24 customers.
Response:  Initially, Dan had $ 5 (since he bought something for $ 2). So, his remaining amount was $ 5 - $ 2 = $ 3.
Response:  If Dan had $ 4 and he spent three dollars on a snoopie, then he has $ 4 - $ 3 = $ 1 left. So the cost of the snoopie is $ 3.
Response:  First, we know that Dan had initially $ 4. Then he bought 99 pieces of candy for $ 3 each. So, he spent $ 3 x 99 = $ 297. Now, we want to find out how much money is left with Dan after buying the candy. To do this, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had: $ 4 - $ 297 = -$ 293. Therefore, there is negative $ 293 remaining in Dan's pocket.
Response:  If Dan has three dollars and bought two pieces of chocolate for four dollars, then he spent $3 + $4 = $7 on the chocolate. So each piece of chocolate cost him $7 / 2 = $3.50.
Response:  We know that Dan has $ 2 and he bought something for $ 6. So we can write this as follows:  $ 2 = $ 6 - x where x is the amount Dan paid for what he bought. Since each piece of candy costs $ 3, we can say that x = 2 pieces of candy. Therefore, Dan bought 2 pieces of candy.
Response:  First, Dan spent $2 for the snoopie, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. Then, he spent $3 for the chocolate, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, there are still $2 in his pocket.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 7 on the snoepje and $ 6 on the chocolate. So he has spent in total $ 7 + $ 6 = $ 13. Therefore, he has spent $ 13 on both the chocolate and the snoepie.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $6 on a snoopie and $3 on chocolate. So he has spend in total $9 (6+3). Now we know that he had initially $2, so after buying both of these things, he is left with $2-$9=$-7. Therefore, he has spent $7 on chocolate and $0 on snoopie.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $2 on snoop and $3 on chocolate. So he has $5 - $2 = $3 left after buying both of them. Therefore, he spent $3 on chocolate and $2 on snoop.
Response:  Firstly, Dan had $ 4 and spent $ 8 on buying a snoopie. So he has $ 4 - $ 8 = -$ 4 left. Then his friend gave him $ 5. So now he has $ -4 + $ 5 = $ 1 left.
Response:  If Dan had $3 after buying a candy bar that cost $1, then he must have had $3 initially (since he spent $1 on the candy). So if he now has $4, that means he gained $1 ($4 - $3 = $1). Therefore, the cost of the candy bar is $1.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent three dollars on snoopies, so he has four dollars left (initial amount - money spend = remaining amount). Now we know that each piece of candy costs one dollar, so if Dan bought ten pieces of candy, he paid one hundred dollars in total (ten x one dollar = one hundred dollars). Therefore, there are still ninety-seven dollars left with him (remaining amount = initial amount - cost of goods purchased).
"Response:  If Dan has three dollars and he bought two pieces of candy that cost each equally much, then... (1 mark)

Answer explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Dan has three dollars and he bought two pieces of candy that cost each equally much. To find out how much each piece of candy costs, we can divide the total amount of money Dan has ($3) by the number of pieces of candy he bought ($2). This gives us the cost of each piece of candy: $3 / $2 = $1.50 per piece. Therefore, each piece of candy costs $1.50. (1 mark)"
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 3 on chocolate and $ 7 on candy. So he has $ 5 left after buying both ( $ 3 + $ 7 = $ 10). Therefore, he spent $ 5 on candy and $ 5 on chocolate.
Response:  Firstly, Dan spent $ 7 on chocolate and $ 2 on a piece of candy. So he has spent a total of $ 9. Therefore, he has spent more money on chocolate than on a piece of candy.
Response:  We know that Paul has 115 books initially and he sold 78 of them during the garage sale. So, we need to find out how many books he still has left. To do this, we can use the following equation: Number of books remaining = Initial number of books - Number of books sold The initial number of books is given as 115, and the number of books sold is also given as 78. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation like this: Number of books remaining = 115 - 78 = 37 So, Paul has 37 books left after selling 78 at the garage sale.
Response:  If Paul started with x books and sold 137 of them, then he has x - 137 books left. Now, if he sold another 105 books, he has (x - 137) + 105 = x books left. So, initially, Paul had x books.
"Response:  We know that Paul started with 108 books and after selling some of them in a garage sale he was left with 62 books. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

Let x be the number of books sold at the garage sale.

We know that the total number of books sold = 108 - x (since he still has 62 books).

So, we can substitute the value of x into the first equation to find out how many books were sold:

x + 35 = 108...(1)

Now, we are given that Paul gave 35 books to a friend. So, the number of books he has left is:

62 = x + 35...(2)

Now, we can solve for x using either equation (1) or (2):

Solving for x in equation (1), we get:

x = 73

And solving for x in equation (2), we get:

x = 49

Therefore, Paul sold 73 books at the garage sale and gave 35 books to a friend, leaving him with 49 books."
Response:  If Paul started with 50 books and sold some of them in a garage sale, he must have bought more books to replace those that were sold. So, let's call the number of books he bought x. Then we know that after the garage sale, he had 151 - 50 = 101 books left. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + 50 = 101. Now solve for x: x = 51. So, Paul bought 51 books at the garage sale!
Response:  We know that Paul initially had two books (boeken). Then he bought 150 new books at a garage sale. If he now has 58 books left, we can calculate how many books he sold as follows: Number of books sold = Initial number of books - Current number of books = 2 - 58 = -56 So, Paul sold -56 books.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 21 books and then sold some of them in a garage sale to raise money for charity. After the garage sale, he bought 42 more books. So, his total number of books now is 21 + 42 = 63 books. Later, he gave away 15 books to someone else. Now we need to find out how many books he has left with him after giving away 15 books. To do this, we subtract the number of books he gave away (15) from the total number of books he had (63): 63 - 15 = 48 books. Therefore, Paul has 48 books left with him after giving away 15 books.
"Response:  We know that Paul initially had 71 books and then sold some of them in a garage sale. After the sale, he bought new books, which brought his total number to 116. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Total number of books = Initial number of books + Number of books sold - Number of books bought

We are given that Paul initially had 71 books, he sold some of them (let's say x), and he bought new ones (let's say y). Using these values, we can plug them into the equation above:

Total number of books = 71 + x - y

Now, we want to find out how many books Paul has bought more than he sold. To do this, we subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought:

Number of books bought more than sold = y - x

So, if Paul bought 38 new books and sold some old ones (x), he has 38 - x more books than he sold. In other words, he gained 38 - x books through buying new ones."
Response:  We know that Paul started with 108 books and 55 pens. After the garage sale, he had 66 books and 59 pens. To find out how many books he sold during the garage sale, we can subtract the number of books he had after the sale from the original number of books he had. So, the number of books he sold is:  108 - 66 = 42 books. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books during the garage sale.
Response:  We know that initially Paul had 106 pens and 51 books. After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Books = 51 + x Pens = 106 - 14 Where 'x' is the number of pens sold at the garage sale. Now, we need to solve for 'x'. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that Paul had 82 books after the garage sale. Therefore, the total number of books including both those sold and unsold must be equal to 51 + x. Substituting this value in the first equation, we get: 51 + x = 82 Solving for 'x', we get: x = 31 This means that Paul sold 31 pens at the garage sale.
"Response:  We know that Paul sold some books at a garage sale and made $27 from it. If he had 136 books to sell, then he must have sold x number of books initially. Since he made $27 from selling those initial books, we can write an equation as follows:

$27 = (x \times price) / 100

where ""price"" is the price per book.

Now, we are given that Paul has 27 books left after selling some at the garage sale. So, we can set up another equation:

27 = x - 27

Solving for ""x"", we get:

x = 109

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books at the garage sale."
Response:  We know that Paul gave away 39 books and sold some as well. So he has fewer books left than before. Let's call the number of books he had after giving away/selling some x. Then we can write an equation based on what is given in the problem statement: Total number of books = Number of books after giving away/selling + Number of books remaining with him 134 - x = 68 Now let's solve for x: Subtracting 134 from both sides gives us: -x = 66 Divide both sides by -1 to get the value of x: x = 66 / -1 = 66 Therefore, Paul sold 66 books.
Response:  We know that Paul started with 153 books and 95 pens. After the garage sale, he sold some of his books and pens. He sold 70 books (books = 153 - 70) and 42 pens (pens = 95 - 42). So, after the garage sale, he had 13 books and 23 pens left. To find out how many books he sold during the garage sale, we can divide the number of books he sold (70) by the total number of books he had at first (153): 70 / 153 = 0.46 or approximately 46%. Therefore, Paul sold 46% of his original 153 books during the garage sale.
Response:  We know that Paul started with 42 pens and 143 books. After the garage sale, he had 113 books and 19 pens left. So, we can write an equation: 42 + 143 = 113 + x, where x is the number of pens sold at the garage sale. Solving for x, we get: x = 19. Therefore, Paul sold 19 pens at the garage sale.
Response:  We know that there were initially ten roses in the vase and Jessica picked eight of them from her garden. So, we have to find out how many roses are left in the vase after she picked those eight. To do this, we can use subtraction.  Number of roses in the vase before = 10 - number of roses picked = 8. Therefore, the number of roses left in the vase is 10 - 8 = 2. So, there are two roses left in the vase now.
Response:  In the beginning, there were 16 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica picked 16 more roses from her garden and put them in the vase, so now there are 23 roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses in the beginning was 16.
Response:  Firstly, there were two roses in the vase initially. Then, Jessica threw four roses out of the vase and cut some new roses from her garden to put into the vase. Now, there are 23 roses in the vase altogether. So, we can conclude that Jessica has knipt 21 roses (23 - 2 = 21).
Response:  Jessica took out 33 roses from the vase and added some new ones from her garden to make it up to 17 roses in total. So she had 33 - 17 = 16 more roses that she cut than what she threw away.
Response:  Jessica took out 34 roses from the vase and cut some more from her garden to add to it. So there are now 15 roses in the vase. To find out how many roses she threw away or didn't pick from her garden, we need to subtract the number of roses in the vase from the total number of roses she had. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of roses thrown away/not picked = Total number of roses - Number of roses in the vase = 34 - 15 = 19
Response:  We know that there were seven roses in the vase initially and Jessica plucked some from her garden. So, the total number of roses she had was 7 + however many she plucked = x. Now, we are told that there are 20 roses in the vase now, so the difference between the initial number of roses and the current number is 20 - x. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica knicked is x = 31.
Response:  We know that there were originally 13 roses in the vase and Jessica picked some more from her garden to add to it. So, after she added them, there were 21 roses in total. Now we want to find out how many roses are still left in the garden. To do this, we need to subtract the number of roses in the vase (21) from the original number of roses in the garden (13). Therefore, there are 9 roses still left in the garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some flowers from her garden and added them to the vase. This increased the number of roses to 17 and the number of orchids to 96. So, we can conclude that Jessica has cut 4 roses (15 - 17 = 4) and 30 orchids (62 - 96 = 30).
Response:  We know that there were initially 2 orchideeën in the vase and Jessica has plucked some from her garden. So, after she plucked them, there were 10 rozen and 21 orchideeën in the vase. To find out how many orchideeën Jessica knipt, we need to subtract the number of orchideeën she had originally from the new total number of orchideeën in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 21 - 2 = 19 orchideeën.
Response:  We know that initially there were five roses and three orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked some more roses and orchids from her garden to add to the vase. So now there are twelve roses and two orchids in the vase. To find out how many more roses than orchids there are in the vase, we can subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses: 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, there are nine more roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked some more roses from her garden and put them into the vase, so now there are 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. To find out how many orchids are now more than roses in the vase, we need to subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers:  Number of orchids > roses = 20 - 11 = 9. So, there are 9 more orchids than roses in the vase.
Response:  If there were three roses in the vase initially and she cut some to put them in the vase, then the number of roses she cut is equal to the difference between the total number of roses in the vase now (19) and the initial number of roses (3). So, she has cut 16 roses (19 - 3 = 16).
Response:  We know that there were initially 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica picked some flowers from her garden and added them to the vase. After she did this, there were now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of roses that were already in the vase (14) from the total number of flowers Jessica added (91), we get the number of orchids that Jessica picked from her garden: 91 - 14 = 77 orchids. Therefore, Jessica picked 77 orchids from her garden.
Response:  We know that there were initially 3 orchideeën and 16 rozen in the vase. Then Jessica plucked some roses and orchids from her garden to add to the vase. After she added them, there were now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. So, if we subtract the number of orchids she already had (3) from the total number of flowers in the vase after she added more (7), we get the number of orchids she knicked: 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, Jessica has knitted 4 orchids.
Response:  We know that there were initially six roses and twenty orchids in the vase. Then Jessica plucked some more roses and orchids from her garden to add to the vase. In total, there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. So, we can calculate how many more roses than orchids are in the vase as follows: Number of roses = 22 - 6 = 16 More roses than orchids in the vase.
Response:  We know that initially there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Then Jessica picked some more flowers from her garden and added them to the vase. This means that now there are 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So, we can see that there are now more orchids than roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of orchids is greater than the number of roses in the vase.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off a few centimeters of it, then her new length would be less than 17 inches. We can assume that she cut off half an inch or 5 cm from her hair. So, after cutting off 5 cm, her hair would be 16.5 inches (or 40 cm) long. Now, if we subtract 3 inches (or 7.5 cm) from this new length, we get 13 inches (or 33 cm). Therefore, Robin has cut off 3 inches (or 7.5 cm) of her hair.
Response:  Before she cut her hair, Robin had 20 cm of hair. If now it is only 10 cm long, then we can say that the length of her hair before cutting = current length of her hair x original length of her hair / current length of her hair. So, 20 cm / 10 cm = 2. Therefore, Robin's hair was 20 cm long before she cut it.
Response:  First, we know that Robin had 16 inches of hair before she cut 15 centimeters off. So her original length was 16 + 15 = 31 inches (or 78 cm). Then, after cutting 15 centimeters off, her new length would be 31 - 15 = 16 inches (or 40 cm). Finally, when her hair grew back to 12 inches, her current length would be 16 + 12 = 28 inches (or 71 cm). Therefore, Robin's hair is currently 28 inches long.
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long (which is equal to 48 cm), and it grew by 18 cm, then her new length would be:  48 cm + 18 cm = 66 cm   So, Robin's hair is now 66 cm long.
"Response:  If Robin had her hair cut off by 30 cm and it was initially 14 cm long, then we can calculate how long her hair is now as follows:

New length = Initial length - Cutting amount
= 14 cm - 30 cm
= -16 cm

So, Robin's hair is now -16 cm long."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robin's hair was originally 45 cm long (or 8 inches). Then she cut off 20 cm of it (which is equal to 8 inches). So now her hair length is shorter than before by 20 cm or 8 inches. Therefore, her current hair length must be less than 45 cm or 8 inches. The exact value can be calculated as follows: 45 - 20 = 25 cm or 10 inches. Hence, Robin's hair is currently 25 cm or 10 inches long.
Response:  We know that Danny had 12 bottle caps before he found any more in the park. So, if he found 53 additional bottle caps, then he now has 65 bottle caps (12 + 53).
Response:  We know that Danny had 21 bottles in his collection and found more bottle caps in the park. So he now has 53 bottle caps in total. To find out how many he found in the park, we can divide the total number of bottle caps (53) by the number he already had (21): 53 / 21 = 2.56. Therefore, Danny found 26 bottle caps in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny found 63 new flessendopjes in the park and threw away 51 old ones. So he has 33 flessendopjes left. In total, Danny had 63 + 51 = 114 flessendopjes at some point.
Response:  We know that Danny started with 36 flessendopjes and threw away 35 old ones. So he had 36 - 35 = 1 left initially. Then he found 22 more flessendopjes in the park. Therefore, his final collection is 1 + 22 = 23 flessendopjes.  So, Danny has found more flessendopjes in the park than he threw away.
"Response:  We know that Danny found 30 flessendopjes in the park and he has 42 now. So, he gained 12 flessendopjes. Now we need to find out how many more flessen Danny went through than what he found in the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of flessendopjes he found from the total number of flessendopjes he has:  
(Total number of flessendopjes - Number of flessendopjes found in the park) = (42 - 30) = 12  Therefore, Danny went through 12 more flessendopjes than he found in the park."
Response:  In the beginning, Danny had 0 flessendopjes and 0 verpakkingen. Then he found 22 flessendopjes and 8 verpakkingen in the park. So, at this point, Danny had 22 + 8 = 30 flessendopjes and 8 + 8 = 16 verpakkingen. Now, he collected more flessendopjes and verpakkingen, so his total collection increased to 28 flessendopjes and 63 verpakkingen. Therefore, Danny had 30 (initial) + 28 (newly collected) = 58 flessendopjes and 63 (initial) + 63 (newly collected) = 126 verpakkingen in his collection initially.
Response:  In the beginning, Danny found 22 flessendopjes and 30 verpakkingen in the park. So he started with 22 + 30 = 52 items. Then, he collected more items from the park, which resulted in him having 17 fewer flessendopjes (17 - 22 = -5) and 57 more verpakkingen (57 - 30 = 27). Therefore, the number of verpakkingen that Danny had in the beginning was 52 - 27 = 25 verpakkingen.
Response:  First, we know that Danny found 30 flesjes and 14 verpakkingen in the park. So far so good! Then he collected more stuff from his collection, which included 7 flesjes and 86 verpakkingen. Now let's compare how many flesjes to verpakkingen Danny has in total:  Total number of flesjes = 7 + 30 = 37 flesjes Total number of verpakkingen = 86 + 14 = 100 verpakkingen Therefore, Danny had more verpakkingen than flesjes in the park. In fact, he has twice as many verpakkingen as he does flesjes!
Response:  We know that Danny started with 0 flessens and 0 verpakkingen (since he didn't have any before going to the park). Then, he found 11 flessen and 28 verpakkingen in the park. So, his new total is:  Flessen: 11 + 0 = 11 Flessenkappen: 0 + 28 = 28 Verpakkingen: 0 + 28 = 28 Now, we are told that Danny has collected 68 flessen and 51 verpakkingen. So, his updated total is:  Flessen: 11 + 68 = 79 Flessenkappen: 28 + 51 = 80 Verpakkingen: 28 + 51 = 79 Therefore, Danny has more verpakkingen than flessenkappen in the park. The difference between the number of verpakkingen and flessenkappen is: 79 - 79 = 0.
Response:  At first, Danny found 71 flessendopjes and 24 verpakkingen in the park. So he had 71 + 24 = 95 items initially. Then, he collected 28 more flessendopjes and 16 more verpakkingen. Therefore, now he has 95 - 28 = 67 flessendopjes and 16 - 16 = 0 verpakkingen. So, Danny now has more flessenkappen than verpakkingen. The difference between the number of flessendopjes and verpakkingen is 67 - 0 = 67 more flessendopjes than verpakkingen.
Response:  At first, Danny found 10 flessen and 62 verpakkingen in the park. So he had 10 + 62 = 72 items initially. Then, he collected more items from the park, which were 27 flessen and 43 verpakkingen. Therefore, his new collection consists of 72 (initial amount) + 27 (new flessen) + 43 (new verpakkingen) = 142 items. Now, we need to find out how many more verpakkingen than flessenkappen Danny has now. So, let's divide the number of verpakkingen (142) by the number of flessenkappen (72): 142 / 72 = 1.95. Therefore, Danny has 1.95 more verpakkingen than flessenkappen.
Response:  In the beginning, Danny had 66 flessendopjes. Now he has 25 left. So, to find out how many he had initially, we can subtract the number of remaining from the total: 66 - 25 = 41. Therefore, Danny had 41 flessendopjes in the beginning.
Response:  If Danny already has 25 flessenkappen (flask lids) in his collection and he finds 32 more flasks in the park, then he must have found 32 - 25 = 7 more flask lids than he already had in his collection. So, he found 7 more flask lids in the park.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 60 old bottles and found 58 new ones. So he has 67 bottles now. To find out how many bottles he had at first, we can subtract the number of bottles he threw away from the total number of bottles he has now: 67 - 60 = 7. Therefore, Danny had 7 bottles in the beginning.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 6 old bottles and found 50 new ones. So he has 50 - 6 = 44 more new bottles than he threw away. Therefore, Danny has 44 + 6 = 50 bottles in his collection now.
Response:  We know that Danny threw away 54 old bottles and found 48 new ones. So he has 6 more new bottles than old bottles (54 - 48 = 6). Therefore, Danny has thrown away 6 more bottles than he found.
Response:  In the beginning, Danny collected 82 verpakkingen and 29 flessendopjes in the park. Later, he found 42 more flesjes and 61 more packages. So, initially, Danny had 82 + 29 = 111 items.
Response:  In the beginning, Danny found 66 verpakkingen and 39 flessendopjes in the park. If he collected all of them, then he has 66 + 39 = 105 items now. However, the question states that he already had 16 flesjes and 68 verpakkingen in his collection before going to the park. So, we need to subtract the number of items he already had from the total number of items he found in the park: 105 - 16 - 68 = 27. Therefore, Danny had 27 verpakkingen in the beginning.
Response:  We know that initially, Danny had 46 verpackingen and 50 flessendopjes in the park. Then he found 21 more flessendopjes and 52 more verpakkingen. So, the total number of flessendopjes is now 73 (46 + 21). The total number of verpakkingen is also 73 (50 + 23). Therefore, Danny has 21 more flessendopjes than verpakkingen in the park.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Danny found 65 verpackingen and 5 flessendopjes in the park initially. Then he collected 31 more bottles and 9 more packages. So, the total number of packages he found is 65 + 9 = 74. Now, we need to find out how many more packages than bottles Danny has in his collection. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottles from the number of packages: 74 - 31 = 43. Therefore, Danny has 43 more packages than bottles in his collection.
Response:  At first, Danny had 58 flessendopjes and 25 verpakkingen in the park. So he started with 58 + 25 = 83 items. Then, he found 11 more verpakkingen and 12 more flessendopjes. Therefore, his new collection consists of 83 + 11 = 94 items (6 verpakkingen) and 94 + 12 = 106 items (flessendopjes). So, Danny now has more flessendopjes than verpakkingen.
Response:  At first, Danny had 15 bottles and 18 packages in the park. So he had 15 + 18 = 33 items initially. Then, he found more items in his collection, which were 67 packages and 35 bottles. Therefore, now he has 33 (initial amount) + 67 = 100 items in total. Since there are more packages than bottles, Danny now has 67 packages and 35 bottles.
Response:  We know that Jake had 11 fewer perches than Steven. So if Jake has 17 perches, then Steven must have 28 perches (17 - 11 = 16).
Response:  We know that Steven has more than Jake because he has 14 - 7 = 7 more perziken than Jake. And we also know that Steven has 15 perziken in total. So if Steven has x perziken more than Jake, then Jake has x + 7 perziken. Therefore, Jake has 24 perziken (x + 7).
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven and Steven has more chickens than Jill. So if we subtract the number of chickens that Jake has from the total number of chickens that Steven has, we will get the number of chickens that Jill has. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 27 perziken (19 - 18 = 27).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven and Steven has more chickens than Jill. So, if we start with Jake, he has x chickens (less than 3). Then, Steven has y chickens (more than 8), where y > x. Finally, Jill has z chickens (fewer than 5), where z < x + y. Now, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + y = z
Solving for x, we get:
x = z - y
Substituting this value in the original equation, we get:
Jake has x = 2 less chickens than Jill.
So, Jake has 3 - 2 = 1 more chicken than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has more perzicken than Jill because he has 4 and she has 0. So if we subtract 4 from Jill's number of perzicken, we get -4. Now let's see how many perzichen Jake has. According to the question, Jake has 12 fewer perzicken than Steven, which means he has 12 less than 4 = 2. Therefore, Jake has 2 perzicken. Finally, we can find out how much more perzicken Jill has than Jake by adding their numbers: Jill has 0 (which is equal to minus 4) plus Jake's 2 equals 2 more perzicken. So Jill has 2 more perzicken than Jake.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven and more chickens than Jill. So we can start with Jake's number of chickens as follows:
Jake = 7 - (Steven - Jill)
= 7 - (-3)
= 10
Therefore, Jake has 10 chickens."
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven and more chickens than Jill. So if we subtract the number of chickens that Jake has from the total number of chickens that Steven has, we will get the number of chickens that Jill has. Therefore, the answer is:  Jill has 10 perziken (7 - 8 = 3 + 17 = 20).
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven and more chickens than Jill. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Jake - 9 = Steven + 18
Jill = Steven - 9
Now we have two equations to solve for the value of ""Steven"". Solving both equations simultaneously gives us:
Steven = 24
So Steven has 24 more perzicken than Jill."
Response:  We know that Steven has 18 more pears than Jill and Jill has 5 pears. So, if we subtract 5 from 18, we get -13. This means that Steven has 18 - (-13) = 31 pears. Now, we are told that Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steven has 31 + x pears. Since Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven, this means that Jake has 31 + x - 6 = 25 pears. Therefore, Jake has 25 pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer chickens than Steven. So, if Steven has x chickens, then Jake has x - 5 chickens.  We also know that Steven has more chickens than Jill. So, if Jill has y chickens, then Steven has y + 18 chickens.  Now we can set up an equation based on these statements:  Jake has x - 5 chickens, and Steven has y + 18 chickens.  Substituting Jake's value into the second equation gives us:  y + 18 = (x - 5)  Solving for x (the number of chickens Jake has), we get:  x = 93  Therefore, Jake has 93 chickens.
Response:  We know that Steven has more than Jill and Jake combined. So if Jill has x perziken, then Steven has at least x + 16 = 32 perziken. Now we also know that Jake has fewer than both Jill and Steven. Therefore, Jill has x - 16 = 48 perziken more than Jake.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Steven has x perziken, then Jake has x - 12 perziken.  Moreover, we know that Jake has more apples than Steven. Therefore, if Steven has y apples, then Jake has y + 79 apples. Now we can use substitution to solve for x and y.  Substituting x = y + 12 into the first equation gives us:  x - 12 = y + 12  Solving for x, we get:  x = y + 34  Similarly, substituting y = 19 into the second equation gives us:  y + 79 = 19  Solving for y, we get:  y = 60  Therefore, Jake has 60 perziken.
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven. So, if Jake has x perziken, then Steven has x + 3 apples. Since Steven has 9 perziken and 8 appels, we can write an equation:  x = 9 - 3. Solving for x, we get:  x = 6. Therefore, Jake has 6 apples.
Response:  We know that Jake has 6 fewer pears than Steven and 8 more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract 6 from Steven's number of pears (17), we get 11. And if we add 8 to Steven's number of apples (16), we get 24. Therefore, Steven has 11 more pears than apples.
"Response:  We know that Jake has fewer persimmons than Steven and more apples than Steven. So if we subtract the number of persimmons from both numbers, we will get the difference in apple count between them.  Therefore, the number of apples that Steven has more than persimmons is:
Steven has 12 persimmons - Jake has 3 less = 9 apples more than persimmons."
Response:  We know that Steven has 12 chickens and Jill has 67 chickens more than Steven. So, if Steven has x chickens, then Jill has x + 67 chickens. Now we are given that Jake has 4 fewer chickens than Jill. Therefore, Jake has (x + 67) - 4 = 103 chickens.
"Response:  We know that Steven has 18 chickens and Jake has fewer than 18 chickens (since he is described as having ""12 perziken minder"" which means ""12 less chickens""). So if Jake has x chickens, then Steven must have 18 - x chickens. Now we are told that Steven has 8 more chickens than Jill. This means that Jill has x + 8 chickens. Therefore, the number of chickens Jill has can be calculated as follows:  Jill = Steven - Jake = 18 - x + 8 = x + 10  So Jill has 10 chickens."
Response:  We know that Steven has 19 chickens and Jill has 72 - 12 = 60 chickens less than Jill. So, Jake must have 19 + 60 = 79 chickens.
Response:  We know that Steven has 14 chickens and Jake has fewer than 14 chickens. So, Jake must have 14 - x = 14 - 6 = 8 chickens. And we also know that Jill has 3 more chickens than Jake, so Jill has 8 + 3 = 11 chickens. Therefore, Jill has 11 chickens.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven and fewer perziken than Steven. So if we add up all of their fruit, Jake must have 84 + 10 = 94 apples. And since Steven has 13 perziken, Jake must have 94 - 13 = 81 perziken.
Response:  We know that Jake has more apples than Steven. So, if we subtract the number of perziken that Steven has from the total number of apples that Jake has, we will get the number of apples that Jake has. Therefore, the answer is:  Apples = 13 + (17 - 8) = 13 + 9 = 22
Response:  We know that Jake has fewer pears than Steve. So, if Jake has x pears, then Steve has x + 10 = 20 pears. Now we know that Steve has more apples than pears, so he must have x - 8 = 12 apples. Therefore, Steven has 12 more apples than pears.
Response:  We know that Jake has three fewer perziken than Steven and four more apples than Steven. So if Steven has x apples and y perziken, then Jake has x -3 perziken and y +4 apples. Since Steven has 19 apples, he must have at least 16 apples (since you can't have less than zero). Therefore, Steven has 16 apples and 11 perziken (since he has 15 perziken minus the three he doesn't have). So, Steven has one apple more than perziken.
Response:  We know that there were originally $78 in Olivia's purse and she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, we can write an equation: $$ 78 - 15 = x $$ where $x$ is the amount of money Olivia has left in her purse. Now, we need to solve for $x$. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2$, since there are two dollars left over after spending $15$: $$ \frac{78}{2} - \frac{15}{2} = x $$ Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get: $$ 39 = x $$ Therefore, Olivia has $39$ left in her purse.
Response:  If Olivia has $78 and spends $33, then she will have $45 left ($78 - $33 = $45). So, Olivia had $45 at the end of the transaction.
Response:  Firstly, we know that $100 was in Olivia's purse initially. Then she spent some money at an arcade and had $148 left. Later, she went to a supermarket and spent even more money, leaving her with $159. So, the total amount of money Olivia has spent is: $100 + $148 + $159 = $307. Therefore, the amount of money she has left is: $307 - $100 = $207.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were three dollars in Olivia's purse initially. Then she spent some money at the supermarket and had $49 left. Finally, she went to an ATM and withdrew more money. So, let's calculate how much more money she got from the ATM than what she spent at the supermarket: $$ \therefore Total amount of money Olivia received from the ATM = $3 + $49 = $52 $$ Now, we need to find out how much more money Olivia got from the ATM than what she had in her purse initially: $$ \therefore Amount of money Olivia gained from the ATM = $52 - $3 = $49 $$ Therefore, Olivia gained $49 more money from the ATM than what she had in her purse initially.
Response:  We know that there were $53 in Olivia's purse initially and she got $91 from an automated teller machine. So, the total amount of money she had was:  $$53 + $91 = $144$.  Then we are told that after visiting a supermarket, there were $14 more dollars than before. Therefore, the final amount of money Olivia had is:  $$144 + $14 = $158$.  So, Olivia spent $158 - $91 = $67more at the supermarket than she received at the ATM.
Response:  We know that there were initially $106 in Olivia's purse and after visiting the supermarket, she had $70 left. Then, she went to the showroom where she spent $49. So, now she has $31 left ($70 - $49 = $31). Therefore, she spent $49 at the showroom.
Response:  If there were still $29 left after her visit to the supermarket and she had $54 in her purse, then she must have spent $29 + $54 = $83 at the supermarket. So, she has spent $83 out of her $54.
Response:  If Olivia had $128 in her purse and she spent $38 at the supermarket, then she has $128 - $38 = $90 left. So, she has $90 still in her purse.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 apps on his phone. Then he removed five apps. So, there are 19 - 5 = 14 apps left on his phone. Therefore, there are 14 apps still on Dave's phone.
Response:  When Dave started, he had 18 apps on his phone. Then, he removed 18 apps, leaving him with 0 apps for a moment. After that, he added 5 new apps, so he now has 5 apps left on his phone. Therefore, the number of apps Dave had on his phone when he started is 18.
Response:  At first, Dave had 10 apps on his phone. Then he added 11 new apps, so now he has 21 apps in total (10 + 11 = 21). Later, he removed some of them, but we don't know how many exactly. So let's assume that he removed 4 apps. Now, Dave has 21 - 4 = 17 apps left on his phone.
Response:  We know that Dave initially had 21 apps on his phone and then added 89 new ones. So, he has a total of 21 + 89 = 106 apps now. Then we are asked how many apps he added after removing some. This means that he must have removed some number of apps from the original total of 106. Therefore, the number of apps he added is equal to the remaining number of apps after removal, which is 106 - (number of apps removed). Since we don't know the exact number of apps he removed, we can only estimate it as an unknown variable x. So, the final answer is: Number of apps Dave added = 106 - x.
Response:  We know that Dave initially had 15 apps on his phone and then added 71 new ones. So, he now has a total of 86 apps (15 + 71). When he removed some apps, he was left with 14 apps. Therefore, we can deduce that he must have removed 72 apps (86 - 14 = 72).
Response:  We know that Dave started with 16 apps and 77 files on his phone. After removing some apps and files, he had 5 apps and 23 files left. To find out how many apps Dave removed, we can divide the number of remaining apps (5) by the initial number of apps (16): Number of apps removed = Remaining apps / Initial apps = 5/16 = 3 So, Dave removed 3 apps from his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 17 apps and 21 files on his phone. Then he removed some apps and files, so he had 3 apps and 7 files left. To find out how many files he removed, we can subtract the number of files he had after removing them from the total number of files he had at first: 7 - 21 = -14 files. So, Dave removed 14 files from his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone. After removing some apps and files, he had 21 apps and 4 files left. So, in total, Dave has 21 apps remaining on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 19 apps and 18 files on his phone. Then he removed some apps and files, so he had 6 apps and 15 files left. To find out how many more files than apps Dave has left, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files: 6 apps - 15 files = 9 files. So, Dave has 9 more files than apps on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 17 apps on his phone. After he downloaded some more, he had 18 apps left. So, he added 1 app to his collection.
Response:  We know that Dave started with 59 items (bestanden and apps) on his phone. Then he removed some of them, so he has fewer items now. Specifically, we are told that after removing some apps and files, he had 12 apps and 30 files left. So, to find out how many apps Dave removed, we can subtract the number of apps he still had from the total number of apps he started with: Number of apps Dave removed = Total number of apps - Number of apps remaining After removing some apps and files, Dave had 12 apps remaining, which means he removed 47 apps (= 59 - 12). Therefore, Dave removed 47 apps from his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 items (bestanden and apps) in total. Then he removed some of them, so he had 13 apps left and 21 bestands left. To find out how many bestanden Dave removed, we can subtract the number of bestanden he had after removing some apps from the initial number of bestanden: 21 - 13 = 8. So, Dave removed 8 bestanden.
Response:  At first, Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. Then he removed some apps and files, so he had 5 files and 12 apps left. Therefore, Dave has 12 apps remaining on his phone.
Response:  At first, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. Then he removed some apps and files, so he had 24 files and 2 apps left. To find out how many more files than apps Dave has on his phone, we need to subtract the number of apps from the total number of files:  Number of files = 24 Number of apps = 2 Subtracting the number of apps from the total number of files gives us the difference between the two quantities: Difference = Number of files - Number of apps = 24 - 2 = 22 Files So, Dave has 22 more files than apps on his phone.
Response:  If Nell has 242 baseball cards and she gives 136 to Jeff, then she must have 106 cards left (242 - 136 = 106).
Response:  If Nell initially had 301 baseball cards and gave 301 to Jeff, then she has none left. So, the number of baseball cards Nell had initially is 301 - 301 = 0. Therefore, Nell had 0 baseball cards in first instance.
Response:  We know that Nell had 528 baseball cards and gave some to Jeff. Now she has 252 cards left. So, the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff is equal to the number of cards she had minus the number of cards she has now.  Therefore, the answer is:  528 - 252 = 276  So, Nell gave Jeff 276 baseball cards.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nell had 566 baseball cards initially and gave some of them to Jeff. So, she has fewer cards now than before. We can assume that she gave him an equal number of cards as her total initial collection (566). Therefore, the number of cards Jeff received from Nell is 566/2 = 283 cards. Now, we know that Jeff had 234 cards initially, so he gained 283 - 234 = 149 additional cards from Nell. So, Jeff now has 234 + 149 = 383 cards in total.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card games at first. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has 415 baseball cards and 149 ten-card games left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card games, we can subtract the number of ten-card games from the total number of baseball cards: 415 - 149 = 266. So, Nell has 266 more baseball cards than ten-card games.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card games before giving some to Jeff. After giving them away, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 ten-card games left. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Baseball Cards = 246 + (404 - 214) = 658 Ten Card Games = 214 + (495 - 214) = 709 Now, we need to find out how many more ten-card games Nell has than baseball cards. To do this, we subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of ten-card games: Number of Ten Card Games > Baseball Cards = 709 - 658 = 51 Therefore, Nell has 51 more ten-card games than baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell gave some cards to both John and Jeff. So, she must have given more cards to Jeff than to John. Also, we are told that she has 210 cards left after giving some to Jeff. Therefore, we can conclude that Jeff received at least 210 - 195 = 15 cards from Nell.
Response:  We know that Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of baseball cards:  Number of baseball cards = 178  Number of ten-card packs = 55  Difference = Number of baseball cards - Number of ten-card packs = 178 - 55 = 123 So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.
Response:  We know that Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-kaarten initially. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so she now has fewer cards than before. Specifically, she has 376 ten-kaarten and 111 baseball cards. To find out how many more ten-kaarten Nell has than baseball cards, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the total number of cards she has:  Number of ten-kaarten = Total number of cards - Number of baseball cards  In this case, the total number of cards is 376 (ten-kaarten) + 111 (baseball cards) = 487. So, Nell has 487 - 111 = 376 more ten-kaarten than baseball cards.
Response:  At first, Paco had 35 cookies and he gave away 19 of them. So, initially, Paco had 35 - 19 = 16 cookies.
Response:  Paco started with 28 koekjes and ate some of them. We know that he ate a few because he had 7 left after eating some. So, we can say that Paco ate x number of koekjes, where x is the difference between 28 and 7 (x = 21). Therefore, Paco ate 21 koekjes.
Response:  Paco started with 40 koekjes and then he ate two. So now he has 38 koekjes left (40 - 2 = 38). Then he bought 37 more koekjes. So in total, Paco has 75 koekjes (38 + 37 = 75). Therefore, Paco still has 75 koekjes left.
Response:  Paco had initially 25 koekjes and he has eaten 5 of them. So, he has 25 - 5 = 20 koekjes left. Then, he bought 3 more koekjes. So, now he has 20 + 3 = 23 koekjes in total. Therefore, he has eaten more koekjes than he bought (i.e., 5 > 3).
Response:  Paco has eaten two koekjes, so he has x - 2 koekjes left (where x is the total number of koekjes Paco bought). Since he has eaten two, we know that x - 2 = 13 (the original number of koekjes Paco bought). So, Paco has 13 - 2 = 11 koekjes left.
Response:  Paco initially had 40 koekjes and then he ate 5 of them. So, after eating 5 koekjes, Paco had 40 - 5 = 35 koekjes left. Then, he gave 13 koekjes to his friend. Now, Paco has 35 - 13 = 22 koekjes left. Therefore, Paco still has 22 koekjes.
Response:  Paco initially had 17 koekjes and ate 14 of them, leaving him with 17 - 14 = 3 koekjes. Then he gave 13 to his friend, so now he has 3 - 13 = -10 koekjes (he owes his friend 10 koekjes). So, Paco has eaten more koekjes than he gave away.
Response:  Paco had 12 koekjes and he ate 16 of them. So, he has 12 - 16 = -4 koekjes left. Then, he gave his friend 21 koekjes. So, his friend got 21 + (-4) = 17 more koekjes than Paco himself had. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 17 more koekjes than he himself ate.
Response:  Paco initially had 22 sweet cookies and 75 salty cookies. If he ate 15 sweet cookies and 54 salty cookies, then he has left over 22 + 54 = 76 cookies. So, Paco still has 76 cookies.
Response:  First, we know that Paco initially had 9 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. So together he had 15 cookies (9 + 6 = 15). Then, he ate 36 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies. So now he has 71 cookies in total (36 + 3 = 71). Finally, he ate 3 more salty cookies, so he has 68 salty cookies left (71 - 3 = 68). Therefore, Paco still has 68 salty cookies.
"Response:  We know that Paco has 37 zoete koekjes and 11 zout. If he eats five zoete koekjes and two zoute koekjes, then we can calculate how many more zoete koekjes he has eaten than zoute koekjes as follows:

Number of zoete koekjes Paco ate = 5 + (37 - 11) = 26

So, Paco has eaten 26 more zoete koekjes than zoute koekjes."
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 20 zoete koekjes and 34 zout. So he has eaten more zout than zoete koekjes. The difference between these two numbers is 34 - 8 = 26. Therefore, Paco has eaten 26 zout koekjes more than he has eaten zoete koekjes.
Response:  At first, Paco had 37 cookies and then he ate 36 of them. So, if he had 37 cookies to start with, how many did he have left after eating 36? The answer is 1 cookie.
Response:  Paco initially had 36 koekjes and gave away 14 to his friend. So he has 36 - 14 = 22 koekjes left. Then, he ate 10 more koekjes. Therefore, he now has 22 - 10 = 12 koekjes left.
Response:  Paco had initially 41 koekjes and gave away 9 to his friend. So he has left with 32 koekjes (41 - 9 = 32). Then, he ate 18 koekjes. Therefore, he has more koekjes than he gave away, which is 32 - 9 = 23 koekjes.
Response:  Paco had 6 cookies (zes in Dutch). He gave his friend 30 cookies and ate 23 himself. So he gave his friend more than he ate. To find out how many more, we can subtract the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he gave away: 30 - 23 = 7. Therefore, Paco gave his friend 7 more cookies than he ate himself.
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 97 sweet cookies and 34 salty ones. He ate 15 sweet cookies and 56 salty ones. So, we can write this as an equation: 97 + 34 = 102 (initial amount of cookies) - 15 = 87 (amount of cookies left after eating). Therefore, Paco has 87 cookies left.
Response:  We know that Paco initially had 26 zout koekjes and 17 zoet. He ate 14 zoete koekjes and 9 zoute koekjes. So, we can write this as an equation: 26 + 17 = x (where x is the number of zout koekjes Paco still has). Since he ate 14 zoete koekjes, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:  x - 14 = 9 (since he still has 9 zout koekjes). Solving for x gives us: x = 13. Therefore, Paco still has 13 zout koekjes.
Response:  We know that Paco has eaten 23 zout koekjes and 32 zoete koekjes. So he has eaten a total of 55 koekjes (23 + 32). Now we want to find out how many more zoete koekjes Paco has eaten than zoute koekjes. To do this, we can subtract the number of zoute koekjes from the number of zoete koekjes: 55 - 6 = 49. Therefore, Paco has eaten 49 more zoete koekjes than zoute koekjes.
Response:  Paco initially had 40 zoete koekjes and 25 zout koekjes, for a total of 65 koekjes (40 + 25). Then he ate 28 zoutkoekjes and 15 zoete koekjes. To find out how many more zout koekjes he ate than zoete koekjes, we need to subtract the number of zoete koekjes he ate from the total number of koekjes he had before eating them: 65 - 15 = 50. So, Paco has eaten 50 more zout koekjes than zoete koekjes.
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $7 for her birthday. Then she gave some money away and has $5 left. So, the amount of money she gave away is equal to $7 - $5 = $2. Therefore, Gwen gave away $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $ for her birthday.  She gave away $8 and has $ left with her. So, the total amount of money she got is: $$ = $ + $ = $ Therefore, Gwen received $ for her birthday.
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $2 from her mother for her birthday. Then, her father gave her an additional $4. So, in total, Gwen has $6. Now, she spends $3 of it. Therefore, Gwen has $3 left.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $8 from her mother for her birthday. Then, her father gave her an additional $5. So, in total, Gwen had $8 + $5 = $13. Now, she spent $4 of it. Therefore, the amount of money Gwen received from her mother is $13 - $4 = $9 more than the amount she received from her father.
Response:  First, we know that Gwen received $3 from her mother and $6 from her father, so she has a total of $9 ($3 + $6).  Then, she spent $4, so she is left with $5 ($9 - $4). Now, let's compare how much money Gwen got from each parent: Her mother gave her $3, and her father gave her $6, so her father gave her more money than her mother. Therefore, Gwen received $6 more from her father than from her mother.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, so she has a total of $12.  Then, she spent $4, which means she has $8 left ($12 - $4 = $8). Now, let's compare how much money Gwen got from each parent: Father gave her $5, Mother gave her $7, So, Mother gave her more money than Father. Therefore, Gwen got $7 more from her mother than from her father.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gwen received $5 from her father for her birthday. Then, her mother gave her an additional $2. So, in total, Gwen had $5 + $2 = $7. Now, she spent $6. Therefore, the amount of money Gwen got from her father is $7 - $6 = $1 more than the amount she got from her mother. Hence, Gwen's father gave her $1 more than her mother did.
Response:  If Josh had 9 knick-knacks and lost some of them, he now has 4 knick-knacks. To find out how many knick-knacks he lost, we can subtract the number of knick-knacks he has now (4) from the original number of knick-knacks he had (9). So, he lost 5 knick-knacks.
Response:  If Josh had x knickers in his collection and lost 21 knickers, then he has x - 21 knickers left. Now, if he has 12 knickers, that means he had x = 12 + 21 = 33 knickers in his collection initially.
Response:  At first, Josh had 19 knick-knacks in his collection. Then he lost 11 of them, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 left. After that, he found 5 new ones, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 knick-knacks in his collection. Therefore, Josh has 13 knick-knacks in his collection now.
Response:  We know that Josh had 4 knick-knacks in his collection and lost 16 of them. So he had 4 - 16 = -12 knick-knacks left. Then, he found 8 new ones, so he gained 8 + 4 = 12 knick-knacks. Therefore, he lost more than he found, which is -12 > 12, or -30.
Response:  First, we know that Josh had 7 knick-knacks in his collection and then he lost 8 of them. So, he has 7 - 8 = -1 knick-knack less than before. Now, he found 10 new knick-knacks, so he gained 10 + 0 = 10 more knick-knacks than before. Therefore, he has 7 - 1 = 6 knick-knacks left in his collection after losing 8 and finding 10 new ones.
Response:  At first, Josh had 21 knick-knacks in his collection. Then he found seven more knick-knacks. So now he has 21 + 7 = 28 knick-knacks in his collection.
Response:  Josh had initially 20 knick-knacks in his collection. He gave two knick-knacks to Jack, so he has 20 - 2 = 18 knick-knacks left. Therefore, Josh now has 18 knick-knacks in his collection.
Response:  Josh initially had 22 knick-knacks in his collection. Then, Jack gave him 20 more knick-knacks. So, we can say that Josh now has 22 + 20 = 42 knick-knacks in his collection.
Response:  If Josh lost 11 knick-knacks and he initially had 19, then he has now 8 (19 - 11) knick-knacks left in his collection.
Response:  At first, Josh had 22 knikkers in his collection. Then he found 13 marble ones and lost 5 marble ones. So, how many knikkers does Josh have now? We need to subtract the number of marble knikkers he lost from the total number of knikkers he had at first. Therefore, we can conclude that Josh has 22 - 5 = 17 knikkers left in his collection.
Response:  If Josh had 15 knick-knacks and found 9 of them, then he lost 6 (15 - 9 = 6). So, he lost more than he found. The difference between what he lost and what he found is 6.
Response:  If Josh had 3 knickers and found 6 more, then he has now 9 knickers (3 + 6 = 9). However, he lost 5 knickers, so he actually has 4 knickers left (9 - 5 = 4). Therefore, Josh has 4 knickers more than he initially had.
"Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked four pounds of strawberries. Then we are told that Marco's strawberries alone weighed 19 pounds. So, to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weigh than those of his father, we can subtract the weight of his father's strawberries from the weight of Marco's strawberries:

19 pounds - 4 pounds = 15 pounds

Therefore, Marco's strawberries weigh 15 pounds more than those of his father."
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father weighed 35 pounds with their strawberries.  Since Marco's strawberries weigh 13 pounds, his father must have had 22 pounds of strawberries (35 - 13 = 22). So, the weight of his father's strawberries is 22 pounds more than the weight of Marco's strawberries.
Response:  We know that together, Marco and his father picked 20 pounds of strawberries. His father had 17 pounds of strawberries. So, if Marco has x pounds of strawberries, then he must have less than his father because they added up to 20 pounds. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  x + 17 = 20  Now let's solve for x using subtraction:  Subtracting 17 from both sides gives us:  x = 3  So, Marco had 3 pounds of strawberries.
Response:  The weight of Marco's aardbeien is 8 pounds and that of his father's aardbeien is 32 pounds. So together they weigh 40 pounds (8 + 32).
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 24 kg of strawberries. If Marco lost 9 pounds (or 3.6 kg) of strawberries during their trip back home, then he has 20 kg (or 44 lbs) of strawberries left. So, the weight of Marco's remaining strawberries is 20 kg or 44 lbs. Now we need to find out how much weight the strawberries of his father were before they started their journey. Since Marco's father had more strawberries than him, let's assume that his father had x kg of strawberries initially. Then, after their trip, Marco's father would have less strawberries since he gave some away to Marco. Therefore, the weight of his father's remaining strawberries can be calculated as follows: x - 3.6 kg = 20 kg. Solving for x, we get: x = 23.6 kg. So, the weight of his father's initial strawberries was approximately 23.6 kg or 52 lbs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marco and his father together collected 36 pounds of strawberries (which is equal to 16 kg). Then, during their return journey, Marco's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries, which means he had 28 pounds left (or 12 kg). Now, since Marco's strawberries weighed 4 kg, we can conclude that his father's remaining strawberries must have weighed 10 kg (i.e., 28 - 4 = 24 kg). Therefore, the weight of the strawberries belonging to Marco's father now is 24 kg.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together collected 52 pounds of strawberries (22 + 30 = 52). Now, Marco found additional 36 pounds of strawberries, which means his father must have found 36 - 36 = 0 pounds of strawberries. Therefore, the weight of the strawberries his father found is 0 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 37 pounds of strawberries. If Marco's strawberry weighed 15 pounds, then his father's strawberry must have weighed x pounds, where x is the difference between 37 and 15, which is 22 pounds. Therefore, the weight of his father's strawberry was 22 pounds.
Response:  We know that Marco's aardbeien weighed 30 pounds and his father's aardbeien weighed 17 pounds together. So, to find out how much more Marco's aardbeien weigh than his father's aardbeien, we can subtract the weight of his father's aardbeien from the weight of Marco's aardbeien: 30 - 17 = 13 pounds. Therefore, Marco's aardbeien weighed 13 pounds more than his father's aardbeien.
"Response:  We know that Marco's aardbeien weighed 5 kg and together they weighed 26 pounds (or 11.7 kg). So, to find out how much more his father's aardbeien weigh than Marco's, we can subtract their weights from each other:

Weight of Marco's aardbeien = 5 kg
Weight of Marco and his father's aardbeien = 11.7 kg
Subtracting Marco's weight from the total weight gives us the weight of his father's aardbeien:

Weight of his father's aardbeien = 11.7 - 5 = 6.7 kg
Therefore, his father's aardbeien weighed 6.7 kg more than Marco's aardbeien."
Response:  We know that Marco and his father together picked 30 pounds of beets (which is equal to 13.6 kg). Since Marco's father's beets weighed 11 kilos (or 24.3 oz), then Marco's beets must have weighed 13.6 - 11 = 2.6 kilos or 5.7 lbs. Therefore, Marco's beets weighed 5.7 lbs.
Response:  At first, there were two children in the bus. Then, some more children got on the bus at the stop (5). So now, there are 2 + 5 = 7 children in the bus. Finally, when all the children from the stop boarded the bus, there were 7 + 3 = 10 children in the bus. Therefore, there are 10 - 2 = 8 more children in the bus than before the stop.
Response:  At first, there were 26 children in the bus. Then, 38 more children got on the bus at the stop. So, now there are 26 + 38 = 64 children in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were no children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus at the stop. So, initially, there were 2 + 0 = 2 children in the bus. After that, 40 additional children entered the bus. Therefore, the total number of children in the bus before the next stop is 2 + 40 = 42 children.
Response:  At first, there were 43 children in the bus. When they got off at the bus stop, there were 21 children left in the bus. So, 21 - 43 = -22 children stopted out of the bus at the bus stop.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off at the bus stop. So, now there are fewer children in the bus than before. How many fewer? Well, if there were initially 41 children and now there are only 18 left, then there were 23 more children who got off the bus. Therefore, there were 23 more children in the bus than now.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus at the halt, leaving 11 children inside. Finally, more children entered the bus, so there are now 16 children inside. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is equal to the number of children who entered the bus minus the number of children who were already inside the bus when it departed, which is 10 - 11 = -1. So, there are 1 child who got off the bus.
Response:  We know that there were initially five children in the bus and then six more got on at the stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after they got off is: 5 + 6 = 11. Therefore, there are eleven more children in the bus than who got off.
Response:  We know that initially there were 36 children in the bus and then 68 children got off at the bus stop. So, the total number of children in the bus after 68 children got off is: 36 + (68 - 36) = 40. Therefore, 12 children got into the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 22 children in the bus. Then, 40 children got into the bus while some others got off. So, the total number of children in the bus after this process is:  22 + (40 - 2) = 62. Finally, two children remained in the bus. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus at the stop is:  62 - 2 = 60.
Response:  We know that initially there were 28 children in the bus and then 82 children got into the bus while some came out of it. So, the total number of children inside the bus at any given time was either 28 + x or 82 - x where x is the number of children who came out of the bus. Since the final number of children inside the bus was 30, we can set up the equation as follows:  28 + x = 30... (1)  Now, let's solve for x using substitution method. Substituting Equation (1) into the first equation, we get:  28 + x = 30... (2)  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  28 = 20... (3)  Dividing both sides by 28 gives us: x = 7... (4)  Therefore, more children entered the bus than left it, i.e., 7 more children entered the bus than came out of it.
Response:  We know that there were initially 23 children in the bus and then 4 more got off at the stop. So, the total number of children who got off the bus is 23 + 4 = 27. Therefore, 27 - 8 = 19 children stopted out of the bus.
Response:  If de bakker made 133 tarts and sold 51 of them, then he has 82 remaining tarts (133 - 51 = 82). Now, we need to find out how many more cookies Baker has than he sold. To do this, we can divide the number of remaining tarts by the number of tarts he sold:  Number of remaining tarts = 82 / 51 = 160% more cookies than he sold. So, Baker has 160% more cookies than he sold.
"Response:  We know that de baker made 54 tarts and he sold some of them. So, we can say that the number of tarts he sold is less than or equal to 54. Now, let's assume that he sold x tarts. Then, we have:

Number of tarts left = 54 - x

We are also given that he has 13 tarts left. Therefore, we can write:

x + 13 = 54

Now, solve for x using basic algebra:

x = 41

So, de baker sold 41 tarts."
"Response:  We know that the baker has sold 145 items and still has 72 tarts left. So, if he had made x number of tarts initially, we can set up an equation as follows:

Sold = x - 72

Now, we are asked to find out how many tarts the baker made initially (x). To do this, we can substitute the value of Sold (145) into the first equation:

x - 72 = 145

Solving for x, we get:

x = 217

Therefore, the baker made 217 tarts initially."
Response:  If Bakker made 155 tarts and his friend bought 140 cookies from him, then he must have had 15 - (140 / 2) = 35 cookies left after selling to his friend.
Response:  The baker made 121 tarts and sold 105 of them, so he has 16 left (121 - 105 = 16). Then, he bought 170 new tarts, which means he now has 340 tarts in total (16 + 170 = 386). So, the baker still has 340 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 13 tarts and sold 91 of them. So he has 91 - 13 = 78 left. Then he bought 154 new ones. So now he has 78 + 154 = 232 tarts in total.
Response:  The baker made 170 tarts and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 left (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new tarts. Now, he has 63 tarts left (92 - 31 = 63), since he already had some before buying more. Therefore, the number of more tarts that the baker has sold than he bought is 63 - 31 = 32.
Response:  The first time, Bakker made 110 tarts and sold 75 of them. So he had 35 left (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 tarts. He didn't sell any of these new tarts, so he still has 35 tarts left with him. Therefore, Baker now has 35 + 76 = 111 tarts in total.
Response:  The first time, Bakker made 144 tarts and sold 71 of them. So he had 73 left (144 - 71 = 73). Then, he made another 111 tarts and sold some of them too. How many did he sell? Well, if he sold 71 the first time, then he probably sold about half as much again (71 / 2 = 35) the second time around. That means he sold 35 more tarts for a total of 106 (73 + 35 = 106). So, in total, Baker has made 144 + 111 = 255 tarts and sold 71 + 35 = 106. Therefore, he has made 159 more koekens than he has sold!
Response:  We know that de bakker made 149 tarts and 91 pastries in total. If he sold 10 cakes, then he would have 139 tarts left (149 - 10 = 139). And if he sold 90 pastries, then he would have 9 pastries left (91 - 90 = 9). So, Baker still has 139 tarts.
Response:  We know that de bakker made 7 tarts and 148 pastries in total. If he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries, then we can calculate how many pastries he still has as follows: Total number of pastries = Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20 Pastries So, de baker would have 20 pastries left.
"Response:  We know that Baker made 126 tarts and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 tarts and 81 pastries, then we can calculate how many more tarts than pastries he made as follows:

Number of tarts sold = 115
Number of pastries sold = 81
Difference between number of tarts and pastries = Number of tarts sold - Number of pastries sold
= 115 - 81
= 34

Therefore, Baker made 34 more tarts than pastries."
Response:  The baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 tarts and 88 pastries, then we can calculate how many more pastries than cakes he sold as follows: Pastries sold = Total pastries - Pastries made = 131 - 19 = 112 So, the baker sold 112 more pastries than cakes.
Response:  We know that Baker made 157 tarts and sold 158 of them. So he has one more tart than he sold. Now we also know that he made 169 pastries and sold 147 of them. So he has 22 more pastries than he sold. Therefore, Baker sold 3 more tarts than pastries.
Response:  The baker made 54 tarts and 143 biscuits. If he sold 68 tarts and 92 biscuits, then we can calculate how many more biscuits than tarts were sold as follows: Number of biscuits sold = 92 - 54 = 38 Number of tarts sold = 68 - 14 = 54 Therefore, the baker has sold 38 more biscuits than tarts.
Response:  If de bakker verkocht 44 tarts and he made 48 tarts in total, then he still has 4 tarts left to sell. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  If de baker sold 8 tarts when he had made 40, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 remaining tarts to sell. So, he has more than 40 tarts left to sell.
Response:  The friend of the baker bought 137 cookies from him. If the baker had made 169 tarts, then he must have still had some left over to sell to the friend. So, the number of tarts that the baker had left is equal to the total number of tarts he made minus the number of tarts he sold to his friend.  Therefore, the answer is: 169 - 137 = 32.
Response:  The baker made 173 tarts and bought 103 new ones. So he has (173 - 103) = 70 old tarts left. He sold 86 of them, so now he has (70 - 86) = 4 tarts left. Therefore, the baker still has 4 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 99 tarts and bought 167 new ones. This means he has 167 - 99 = 68 more tarts than he originally had. He sold 89 tarts, which is less than the number of additional tarts he has (68). So, the baker has more tarts than he sold. In other words, he has 68 - 89 = 79 more tarts than he sold.
"Response: 
De bakker made 8 tarts. He bought 139 new tarts and sold 145. So he has sold more than he bought. The difference is 6 (145 - 139). Therefore, Baker has sold 6 more tarts than he bought."
Response:  The baker made initially 62 tarts and then he made additional 149 tarts. So in total, he made 62 + 149 = 211 tarts. He sold 144 of them, so the number of tarts that the baker has left is 211 - 144 = 67 tarts. Therefore, the baker still has 67 tarts.
Response:  The baker made 81 tarts initially and then made an additional 92 tarts. So, in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 tarts.  He sold 46 of them. Therefore, the number of tarts that the baker did not sell is 173 - 46 = 127 tarts.
Response:  We know that de bakker made 61gebakjes and 167 tarts. If he sold 108 tarts and 44 Gebakjes, then we can calculate how many tarts he still has as follows: Number of tarts left = Total number of tarts - Sold tarts = 167 - 108 = 59 So, de baker would have 59 tarts left.
"Response:  We know that de bakker made 56gebakjes and 124 tarts. If he sold 104 tarts and 29 Gebakjes, then we can calculate how many Gebakjes are left as follows:
Gebakjes = Total number of Gebakjes - Number of Gebakjes sold
= 56 - 29
= 27
Therefore, Baker would have 27 Gebakjes left."
Response:  We know that Baker made 52gebakjes and 84taarten. If he sold 102taarten and 94gebakjes, then we can calculate how many more tarts than bread rolls he has made as follows: Number of tarts sold = 102 Number of bread rolls sold = 94 Now, let's subtract the number of bread rolls sold from the total number of tarts made to find out how many more tarts were sold: More tarts sold = Total number of tarts - Number of bread rolls sold = 84 - 94 = -10 So, Baker has made fewer tarts than bread rolls.
Response:  The baker made 134gebakjes and 11 tarts. If he sold 140 tarts and 92 Gebakjes, then we have to find out how many more Gebak than the baker made. So, let's calculate it as follows: Number of Gebakies sold - Number of Gebakies made = Difference in Gebakies. In this case, the difference is: 140-134=6 Therefore, the baker made 6 more Gebakies than what he sold.
Response:  We know that de bakker made 14 cakes and 153 cookies. If he sold 8 cookies and 97 tarts, then we can calculate how many tarts he sold as follows: Number of tarts = Total number of cookies - Number of cookies sold = 153 - 8 = 145 tarts. Therefore, Baker has sold 145 more tarts than he originally made.
Response:  We know that Baker made 43 tarts and sold 154 items. So he must have sold 111 (43 + 154) items in total. Now we are told that out of these 111 items, 78 were tarts. Therefore, the number of Gebakjes (cookies) sold by Baker is: 111 - 78 = 33.
Response:  If Kelly has 22 Nintendo games now and wants to have 140 games in total, she needs to buy x number of games. Since each game costs $60, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of games = Price of games x Total number of games  In this case, the price of each game is $60, and the total number of games Kelly wants to have is 140. So, we can plug these values into the equation: Number of games = $60x  To find out how many games Kelly needs to buy, we need to solve for x. We know that Kelly already has 22 games, so we subtract that from the total number of games she wants to have: $60x - 22 = 140  Now, let's simplify the equation: $60x = 140 - 22  $60x = 118  Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by $60 to find out how many games Kelly needs to buy: x = 118 / $60  x = 1.97  Therefore, Kelly needs to buy approximately 20 games ($1.97 x 20) to reach her goal of having 140 Nintendo games.
Response:  If Kelly has 106 Nintendo games and she gives away 64 of them, then she will have 106 - 64 = 42 more games left. So, Kelly will have 42 Nintendo games left after giving away 64 games.
Response:  If Kelly gave away 91 Nintendo games and she has 92 matches left, then initially she must have had 92 - 91 = 1 Nintendo game.
Response:  Kelly has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. If she wants to have 12 Nintendo games, she needs to give away some of her Sony games. We can start with 5 Sony games since 20 - 5 = 15 is the number of Nintendo games she will have left after giving away 5 Sony games. So, Kelly must give away 5 Sony games to get 12 Nintendo games.
Response:  Kelly has 46 Nintendo games and 132 Sony games. To find out how many Sony games she needs to give away so that she still has 31 Sony games left, we can subtract the number of Sony games she already has from 31. So, Kelly needs to give away 100 - 132 = 32 Sony games.
Response:  Kelly had initially 80 Nintendo games and found additional 31 games. So, she now has a total of 80 + 31 = 111 games. To have six remaining competitions, we need to divide the number of games by 6: 111 / 6 = 18. Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 18 games to have six remaining competitions.
"Response:  When Randy started building the tower, he had x blocks of Lego bricks. Since he used all 52 blocks to build the tower and there are still 38 blocks left, we can write an equation:
x + 38 = 52
To solve for x, we can subtract 38 from both sides of the equation:
x = 14
So, when Randy started building the tower, he had 14 blocks of Lego bricks."
Response:  We know that Randy has 97 blocks in total and he uses them to build a tower. If there are still 72 blocks left after building the tower, then Randy must have used 97 - 72 = 25 blocks to build the tower. Therefore, Randy has used 25 blocks to build the tower.
Response:  We know that Randy has 79 blocks in total. He used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation: 79 = 14 + 11. Solving for the number of remaining blocks, we get: 64. Therefore, there are 64 blocks left over after building the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house. So far, he has used a total of 27 + 53 = 80 blocks. Therefore, Randy has used 80 blocks in total to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  We know that Randy has used 37 blocks in total. He used 33 blocks to build a tower and 13 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of blocks = Number of blocks used for the tower + Number of blocks used for the house  Total number of blocks = 33 + 13  Total number of blocks = 46 Therefore, Randy has used 46 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house.
Response:  We know that Randy used 79 blocks to build a tower and 82 blocks to build a house. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of blocks used for the house = Number of blocks used for the tower + (Number of blocks used for the house - Number of blocks used for the tower)  Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:  Number of blocks used for the house = 79 + (82 - 79)  Simplifying the equation, we get:  Number of blocks used for the house = 13  Therefore, Randy has used 13 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  If Randy has 59 blocks and he uses 36 of them to build a tower, then there are 23 blocks left (59 - 36 = 23).
"Response:  We know that Randy has used 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. So, he has used more blocks for the tower than for the house. To find out how many blocks more, we can subtract the number of blocks used for the house from the total number of blocks used:  
Blocks used for house = 20 Blocks used for tower = 50 - 20 = 30 Therefore, Randy has used 30 blocks more to build the tower than he did to build the house."
Response:  We know that Randy used 89 blocks to build the house and 63 blocks to build the tower. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of blocks used for the house = 89 Blocks used for the tower = 63 Now, we need to find out how many more blocks were used for building the house than for building the tower. To do this, we subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house: More blocks used for the house = 89 - 63 = 26 Therefore, Randy has used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.
Response:  We know that there are 20 books in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If we haven't read any of them yet, then we have not read any books. So, the number of books we have read is equal to zero (0). Therefore, the answer is 0.
"Response:  We know that there are currently 13 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School"" that have been read. If there are still 8 more to be read, then the total number of books in the series is:  13 + 8 = 21 books. Therefore, there are 21 books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
Response:  We know that there are 22 books and 10 movies in the series'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 12 books, then you still need to read 9 more books (22 - 12 = 9). Similarly, if you have seen 56 movies, then you still need to see 44 more movies (10 - 56 = 44). Therefore, you must read 9 books and watch 44 movies.
Response:  We know that there are 4 books and 17 films in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 19 books, then you still need to see 7 - 19 = 12 more films. So, you need to watch 12 more films from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 16 books and 14 films in the series. If you have read 19 books and seen 13 films, then we can calculate how many more books than films there are in the series as follows:

Number of books - Number of films = More books than films
= 19 - 13 = 6

So, there are 6 more books than films in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 10 films in the series "" Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 19 books and seen 61 films, then we can calculate how many more films than books there are in the series as follows: Number of films = 61 - 8 = 53 Number of books = 19 Therefore, there are 53 more films than books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 11 films in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 13 books, then you must have seen fewer than 11 films because you cannot have more than 11 films to see if you only have 13 books to read. Therefore, the number of books you have read is greater than the number of films you have seen. So, the answer is 13 - 11 = 2. You have read more books than films.
Response:  We know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 7 books, then you have not seen any movies yet because you have only read books. So, the number of movies you have seen is 0. Therefore, the difference between the number of movies you have seen and the number of books you have read is 17 - 7 = 10.
Response:  We know that there are eight books in the series 'Geeky Silly School'. If there are total of 14 books in the series, then we need to read six more books (8 + 6 = 14). So, you still have to read six more books from the series 'Crazy Silly School'.
Response:  We know that there are 19 different books in the series and you have already read 4 of them. So, to find out how many more books you need to read, we can subtract the number of books you have already read from the total number of books in the series.  Therefore, the answer is:  You still need to read 56 books ( = 19 - 4).
Response:  We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in the series'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 7 books, then you still need to watch 5 movies (8 - 7 = 5). So, you need to watch 5 more movies from the series.
"Response:  We know that there are 11 books read and 40 movies seen.  To find out how many more books than movies there are in the series, we need to subtract the number of books read from the total number of books in the series.  Therefore, the difference between the number of books and movies is:  Difference = Total number of books - Number of books read  = 15 - 11  = 4  So, there are 4 more books than movies in the ""Crazy Silly School"" series."
"Response:  We know that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series "" Crazy Silly School"". If you have read 13 books and seen 63 movies, then we can calculate how many more movies than books there are in the series as follows:  Number of movies = 63 - 13 = 50  Therefore, there are 50 more movies than books in the series ""Crazy Silly School""."
Response:  We know that there are 10 books and 6 films in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 14 films, then you must have seen at least 14 - 6 = 8 more films than books. Therefore, you have read 8 + 10 = 18 books. So, you have read more books than films.
Response:  We know that there are 8 books and 5 movies in the series 'Crazy Silly School'. If you have read 19 films and seen 16 books, then we can calculate how many more movies than books you have watched as follows: Number of movies = Total number of movies - Number of movies you have seen Number of books = Total number of books - Number of books you have seen In this case, the total number of movies is 8 + 5 = 13, and the total number of books is 8 + 16 = 24. Therefore, if you have read 19 films and seen 16 books, you have watched 13 - 16 = -3 more movies than books. So, you have watched 3 fewer movies than books.
Response:  Dave has won 7 cards and used some of them to buy toys. If he still has 2 cards left, that means he must have used x cards to buy toys. Since he won 7 cards in total, we can write an equation: 7 = x + 2. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, Dave used 5 cards to buy toys.
Response:  If Dave has won x number of cards, then he must have used his winnings to buy something that cost him x/2 amount of money. Since he spent 12 Kaartjes (cards) to buy things, we can conclude that x = 12. So, Dave has won 12 cards.
Response:  Dave has won 18 cards in total. He used 5 cards to buy playthings and 11 cards to buy clothes. So he has 5 + 11 = 16 cards left. Therefore, Dave has 18 - 16 = 2 cards left.
"Response:  We know that Dave has won 19 cards in total and he used 12 of them to buy playthings. So, we have:

Number of cards used for playthings = 12

We also know that Dave used 7 more cards to buy clothes. So, we can write:

Number of cards used for clothes = 7

Now, we want to find out how many more cards Dave used for playthings than for clothes. To do this, we subtract the number of cards used for clothes from the total number of cards won:

Difference between cards used for playthings and clothes = Total number of cards won - Number of cards used for clothes
= 19 - 7
= 12

Therefore, Dave used 12 more cards to buy playthings than he did to buy clothes."
Response:  Dave has won 13 cards in total. He used 8 of them to buy playthings and 18 more to buy clothes. So he has 13 - 8 = 5 cards left. Therefore, Dave has used 5 cards to buy clothes than he did to buy playthings.
Response:  If Dave has won 14 cards and lost 2, he currently has 14 - 2 = 12 cards left. Then, if he uses 10 of those cards, he will be left with 12 - 10 = 2 cards. So, Dave has 2 cards left.
Response:  We know that Haley had 14 trees growing in her backyard before the storm. After the storm, 9 of them died. So, we have 14 - 9 = 5 trees that survived the storm. Therefore, 5 more trees died than survived.
Response:  We know that Haley had 13 trees growing in her backyard before the storm. After the storm, 6 of them died. So, we have 13 - 6 = 7 trees left alive after the storm. Therefore, 7 trees overcame the storm more than those who died.
Response:  We know that Haley had 20 trees growing in her backyard before the storm. After the storm, only four trees were left standing. So, we can conclude that 16 trees died during the storm (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, there are 16 dead trees.
Response:  We know that Haley had 5 trees planted in her backyard before Typhoon 5 hit. Since Typhoon 5 killed all living things, including plants and animals, there are no surviving trees left after the storm. Therefore, the number of trees growing now is zero (0). So, to answer your question directly, none (0) trees will grow if 12 trees were originally planted.
Response: 9 - 4 = 5 So, Haley has 5 trees left after the storm.
Response:  If two trees have died after a hurricane and they initially had 12 trees, then they now have 10 trees left (since 2 are dead). So, if they let 12 more trees grow, they will have 10 + 12 = 22 new trees. Therefore, they will have a total of 10 + 22 = 32 trees.
Response:  If there were originally three trees and after a hurricane, thirteen trees died, then we have a total of 3 + 13 = 16 trees.  Therefore, if Haley had let three more trees grow, she would have had 16 + 3 = 19 trees. So, the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived is 19 - 16 = 3 trees.
Response:  If Haley had 11 trees and two of them died after the hurricane, that means there were nine trees left. So if she had let all ten trees grow, then nine would have survived the hurricane. Therefore, three trees did not survive the hurricane.
Response:  If they pick 66 bags of apples per day and each bag contains 28 apples, then...  We can start by finding out how many bags they pick in total per day: 66 bags/day x 28 apples/bag = 1792 apples/day  So, they pick 1792 apples per day.
Response:  If he can harvest 8 bags of apples per day, it means that in one day he will have collected 8 x 1 = 8 bags of apples. To find out how many days it takes to collect 24 bags of apples, we need to divide the total number of bags by the number of bags collected per day: 24 / 8 = 3 days. Therefore, it will take him 3 days to collect 24 bags of apples.
"Response:  If they will take 4 days to finish the harvest and they collect 56 bags of apples altogether, then we can calculate how many bags they collect each day as follows:

Total number of bags = Total time for harvest / Time taken to collect one bag
= 56 / 4
= 14 bags/day
Therefore, they collect 14 bags of apples per day during the 4-day harvest period."
"Response:  If they can harvest 38 bags per day and each bag contains 42 apples, then after 49 days of harvesting, they will have collected 

$$ \text {Total number of bags} = \text{Daily production} \times \text{Number of days} $$

So, we need to find out how many bags they produce in one day. We are given that they produce $38$ bags per day. Therefore, the total number of bags produced after $49$ days is:

$$ \text {Total number of bags} = 38 \times 49 = 1762 $$

Therefore, after $49$ days of harvesting, they will have collected $1762$ bags of apples."
Response:  If they can harvest 66 bags of apples per day and each bag contains 25 apples, then after 87 days they will have collected 66 x 25 = 1650 apples in total. So, there are 1650 apples after 87 days of harvesting.
Response:  If they can pick 8 baskets per day and each basket contains 35 apples, then they will pick 8 x 35 = 280 apples per day.
Response:  If he can harvest 16 bags of apples per day and each bag contains 57 apples, then in one day he will have collected 924 apples (16 x 57 = 924). To find out how many days it takes to collect 80 bags of apples, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples collected per day:  Number of days = Total number of apples / Number of apples collected per day  Number of days = 924 / 57 = 16 days Therefore, it will take him 16 days to collect 80 bags of apples.
Response:  If they harvest 67 bags of apples per day and each bag contains 12 apples, then they will harvest a total of 67 x 12 = 804 apples per day. So, if they collect 35 bags of apples altogether, they will gather a complete of 35 x 12 = 420 apples altogether.
Response:  If they are able to collect 74 bags of apples every day and throw away 71 bags, then after 51 days, they will have collected 3960 bags (74 x 51 = 3960). So, at the end of 51 days, they will have 3960 - 71 = 3889 bags of apples left.
Response:  If they throw away 64 bags of 50 apples each day, that means they have thrown away 3200 apples (64 x 50 = 3200). So, if they don't throw any apples away, they will harvest 76 x 50 = 3800 apples per day.
Response:  If they can harvest 28 bagged ripe apples and 52 unbagged immature apples each day, then after 26 days of harvesting, they will have collected altogether 28 x 26 = 704 ripe apples and 52 x 26 = 1324 immature apples. So in total, they will have 704 + 1324 = 2028 apples after 26 days of harvesting.
Response:  If they can harvest 82 bag of ripe apples and 61 bags of unripe apples in one day, then after 25 days, they will have collected 82 x 25 = 2050 bags of ripe apples and 61 x 25 = 1525 bags of unripe apples. So, the total number of bags of ripe apples after 25 days is 2050.
"Response:  If they can harvest 31 bags of ripe apples and 24 bags of unripe apples per day, then after 45 days, they will have collected a total of:

31 x 45 = 1365 bags of ripe apples
24 x 45 = 1080 bags of unripe apples

So, in total, they will have collected 2445 bags of apples (1365 + 1080) after 45 days."
Response:  We know that the farmer is able to harvest 44 bag of ripe apples and 25 bags of unripe apples per day. So in total he can harvest 69 bags (44 + 25) of apples per day.
Response:  We know that there are 5 Zakjes rijpe sinaaspellen en 74 Zakjes onrijpe sinaaspellen per dag geoogst. To find out how many more unripe than ripe apples are being harvested each day, we need to subtract the number of ripe from the total number of apples harvested. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of unripe apples = Total number of apples - Number of ripe apples. Substituting the values given in the question into this equation, we get: Number of unripe apples = 74 Zakjes + 5 Zakjes = 89 Zakjes. Therefore, there are 89 more unripe apples than ripe apples being harvested each day.
"Response:  If they harvested 54 bags of apples in total and they were harvesting 18 bags per day, then we can calculate how many days it took to harvest all those apples as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of bags / Daily bag limit
= 54 / 18
= 3

So, it took them 3 days to harvest all 54 bags of apples."
"Response:  If they harvested 56 baskets of apples in one day, then they must have harvested x baskets per day for 14 days. We can set up an equation as follows:

x + (14 - 1)x = 56

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So they harvested 4 baskets of apples per day for 14 days."
Response:  If they can harvest 5 Zakjes rijpe sinaasappels per dag, then after 73 days they will have collected 5 x 73 = 365 rijpe sinaasappels. So, the answer is 365.
"Response:  If they can collect 65 bag of unripe apples and 46 bags of ripe apples in one day, then after 6 days, they will have collected:

Unripe Apples: 65 x 6 = 390 bags
Ripe Apples: 46 x 6 = 276 bags
So, after 6 days, they will have collected 390 bags of unripe apples and 276 bags of ripe apples in total."
Response:  We know that there are 86 Zakjes rijpe sinaasappels per dag.  If he picks 41 bags of unripe apples and 86 bags of ripe apples, then he has picked in total 41 + 86 = 127 bags of apples per day. So, the number of bagges of ripe apples picked per day is 127 / 86 = 1.5 bags per day.
Response:  We know that he picks 71 bag of unripe apples and 60 bags of ripe apples per day. So we can write this as an equation: 71 + 60 = Total number of bags picked per day Now we need to find out how many more unripe apples are picked than ripe ones. To do this, we divide the number of unripe apples by the total number of apples picked: Number of unripe apples / Total number of apples = More unripe apples than ripe ones Now we have our final answer: There are more unripe apples than ripe ones picked per day.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room (L) is given as 4 meters and its width (W) is given as 3 meters. To find out how much longer the room is than it is wide, we need to divide the length by the width: L / W = 4/3 = 1.33 meters. So, Jesse's room is 1.33 meters longer than it is wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse has a room that is 2 meters long. If she needs a rug of four square meters, then we can calculate the length and width of the room as follows: Length = Room length (in meters) x Area of rug (in square meters) / Total area of room (in square meters) Width = Room length (in meters) x Area of rug (in square meters) / Total area of room (in square meters) In this case, let's assume that the total area of the room is equal to the product of its length and width, which means that the area of the room is 2 x 4 = 8 square meters. Now, we can use the formula above to find out the length and width of the room: Length = 2 x 4 = 8 meters Width = 8 meters / 8 = 1 meter So, the width of Jesse's room is 1 meter, and its length is 2 meters.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is given as 2 meters. If we want to find out how long her room is in terms of four square meters, we need to divide the length of the room by 4. So, the length of Jesse's room is 2 meters divided by 4, which equals 0.5 meters or half a meter. Therefore, Jesse's room is 0.5 meters long.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jesse has already put 16 square feet of carpet on the floor, which means she needs to cover the remaining area of the room. To do this, we need to find out how much space remains after covering the existing area with the carpet. We can calculate this by subtracting the area covered by the carpet from the total area of the room. The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is Area = Length x Width. In this case, the length and width of the room are given as 3 meters and 5 meters respectively. Therefore, the area of the room is: Area = 3 x 5 = 15 square meters. Now, let's subtract the area covered by the carpet (which is 16 square feet) from the total area of the room to find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to buy: Total area - Covered area = 15 - 16 = -1 square meter. So, Jesse needs one square meter of additional carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of Jessie's room is 1 meter and its width is also 1 meter. So, the area of the floor can be calculated as follows: Area = Length x Width = 1 m x 1 m = 1 square meter Since there are four sides to each tile (lengthwise, breadth-wise, front side, backside), we need to divide the total area of the floor by 4 to find out how many tiles will cover it completely. Therefore, Number of Tiles = Total Area / Side Length = 1 sqm / 0.5 m = 2 tiles Now, since each tile has a size of one square meter, we know that two tiles will cover an area of 2 square meters.
Response:  We know that each room has a length of 6 meters and a width of 6 meters. Therefore, we need to calculate the total area of all rooms as follows: Area = Length x Width = 6m x 6m = 36 square meters Now, we are asked how much carpeting is needed to cover all the floors. Since there are 20 rooms in total, we can assume that each room needs an equal amount of carpeting. So, the total area of carpeting required = Number of rooms x Total area per room = 20 x 36 = 720 square meters Therefore, Jesse needs 720 square meters of carpeting to cover all the floors in her house.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 20 feet and its width is 19 feet. To find out how much longer it is than its width, we need to subtract the width from the length. So, the length of Jesse's room minus its width is:  20 - 19 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is one foot longer than its width.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of 3 square meters to cover her room. Since we are given that the length of the room is 1.5 meters, we can find its width as follows: Width = Length / 2 = 1.5 m / 2 = 0.75 m Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 0.75 meters.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug of 3 square meters to cover her room. Since her room is 1 meter wide, we can say that its length is equal to 1 meter times the area of the rug divided by the width of the rug. So, we have: Length = Area / Width = (3 m^2) / (1 m) = 3 meters. Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 3 meters.
Response:  The area of the room is given as 1 meter x 6 meters = 6 square meters. Since Jesse has a half-square meter carpet, she needs to cover twice the area of the room with her carpet. Therefore, she needs 6 square meters / 2 = 3 square meters of carpet to cover the entire floor.
Response:  We know that Razorback T-Shirt Winkel sold $23 per each T-shirt and earned $230 during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game from selling T-shirts. To find out how many T-shirts they sold, we can use the following equation: Number of T-shirts = Total amount earned / Price per T-shirt So, in this case, we have: Number of T-shirts = $230 / $23 = 10 T-shirts Therefore, Razorback T-Shirt Winkel sold 10 T-shirts during the Arkansas vs. Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned from selling three T-shirts is $51. So, we can write an equation as follows: 3T = $51. Where T represents the cost of each T-shirt. Now, we need to find out what T is equal to in order to solve for it. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: T = $51 / 3. Simplifying, we get T = $17. Therefore, each T-shirt costs $17.
Response:  We know that the Razorback t-shirt store makes $87 per sold t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech games, they sold 95 t-shirts in total. So, if they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make from selling those t-shirts? Well, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game with the amount of money made per t-shirt: $$ = \text {Number of t-shirts sold during Arkansas game} x \text {Amount of money made per t-shirt}$$ = 47 x $87$$ = $3,999So, the Razorback t-shirt store made $3,999 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
Response:  We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop earned $106 per sold t-shirt. So if they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, their total earnings from those sales would be:  $106 x 115 = $12,340. Now we are given that they sold a total of 242 t-shirts during both games combined. Therefore, the number of t-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game is:  Total sales - Sales during Arkansas game = 242 - 115 = 127.
Response:  We know that the Razorback t-shirt store makes $98 per sold t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech games, they sold a total of 163 t-shirts. If they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game?  To find out, we can multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game by the amount made per t-shirt: $$ = \text {Number of t-shirts sold during Arkansas game} x \text {Amount made per t-shirt}$$. Substituting the given values, we get: $$ = 89 x $98$$ Simplifying and solving for the answer, we get: $$= 8572$$ So, the Razorback t-shirt store made $8572 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
Response:  We know that the Razorback t-shirt store makes $78 per sold t-shirt. If they sold 186 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and made $78 x 186 = $14,504 in revenue. Now we need to find out how much money they made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game if they sold 172 t-shirts. So, $14,504 / 172 = $8394. Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt store made $8394 with the sale of t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
"Response:  We know that Razorback Winkels sells T-shirts for $ 62 and trousers for $ 99. The number of T-shirts sold during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech was 183, and the number of trousers sold was 31. So we can calculate how much money Razorback Winkels earned from each item as follows:
T-shirts: 183 T-shirts x $ 62 per T-shirt = $ 11,546
Trousers: 31 trousers x $ 99 per trouser = $ 3,079
So, in total, Razorback Winkels earned $ 14,625 from the sale of these items during the game."
Response:  We know that the Razorback Winkle makes $67 per T-shirt and $165 per polo shirt. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 74 T-shirts and 156 polo shirts. So, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + Number of Polo Shirts x Price per Polo Shirt In this case, the total number of items sold is 74 T-shirts and 156 polo shirts. Therefore, the total revenue for the Razorback Winkle would be: Total Revenue = 74 x $67 + 156 x $165 = $53,980 + $25,340 = $79,320 This means that the Razorback Winkle earned $79,320 from selling polo shirts during the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech.
Response:  We know that the Razorback Winkels sells each T-shirt for $ 192 and each shirt for $ 34.  During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 polos. To find out how much more a T-shirt costs than a polo, we need to subtract the price of a polo from the price of a T-shirt. So, if a T-shirt costs $ 192, then a polo costs $ 192 - $ 34 = $ 158. Therefore, a T-shirt costs $ 158 more than a polo.
Response:  We know that the Razorback Winkels earns $86 per T-shirt and $232 per jacket. During the game between Arkansas and Texas Tech, they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jackets. To find out how much a shirt costs more than a T-shirt, we need to subtract the price of a T-shirt from the price of a jacket. So, let's do that:  Price of a jacket = $232  Price of a T-shirt = $86 Subtracting the price of a T-shirt from the price of a jacket gives us: $232 - $86 = $146 Therefore, a shirt costs $146 more than a T-shirt.
Response:  The Razorback t-shirt store sells each t-shirt for $51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game... they gave a discount of $8 per t-shirt... and sold 130 t-shirts. So, how much money did they earn from the t-shirts? To find out, we need to calculate the total amount earned from all the t-shirts sold during the event. We can do this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold by the price at which they were sold. In this case, that would be: Total Amount Earned = Number of T-shirts Sold x Price of Each T-shirt Total Amount Earned = 130 x $51 Total Amount Earned = $6,430 So, the Razorback t-shirt store earned $6,430 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.
Response:  We know that each T-shirt is sold for $201 dollars initially and then increased to $358 dollars during the game. So, we can calculate the total number of T-shirts sold as follows: Total Number of T-shirts = Initial price x Number of T-shirts sold During the game, we are given that 14 T-shirts were sold. Therefore, we can calculate the revenue earned from selling these T-shirts as follows: Revenue = Total Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt Substituting the values we have obtained so far, we get: Revenue = 14 x ($201 + $146) = $2940 + $194 = $3134 Now, we need to find out how much money they earned from selling those 14 T-shirts.
Response:  We know that during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, the Razorback T-shirt shop earned $60 in total. If they earn $10 per sold T-shirt, then we can find out how many T-shirts they have sold by dividing the amount of money they earned by the profit per T-shirt. So,  $60 / $10 = 6 T-shirts. Therefore, the Razorback T-shirt shop has sold 6 T-shirts during the game.
Response:  We know that the total amount of money earned by the Razorback T-shirt shop during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game was $215. If they sold 5 T-shirts, then we can find out how much each T-shirt cost by dividing the total amount of money earned by the number of T-shirts sold: $215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt.
Response:  We know that for each T-shirt they sold, they earned $215 and for each jersey they sold, they earned $5. So if they sold 20 T-shirts, their total earnings from T-shirts would be 20 x $215 = $4300. Similarly, if they sold 64 jerseys, their total earnings from jerseys would be 64 x $5 = $3200. Therefore, in total, Razorback Winkelsverdient has earned $7500 ($4300 + $3200).
Response:  We know that each t-shirt costs $204 and each jersey costs $76. So if they sold 158 t-shirts, they made $32,920 in revenue from those ($204 x 158 = $32,920). If they sold 2 jerseys, they made $158 in revenue from those ($76 x 2 = $158). Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from selling jerseys is $158.
Response:  We know that the cost of one T-shirt is $240 and the cost of one trunk is $210. So we can write an equation as follows:  T-shirt = $240  Trunk = $210  Now let's find out how many dollars more a T-shirt costs than a trunk. To do this, we need to subtract the cost of a trunk from the cost of a T-shirt. So we can write another equation as follows:  Difference between T-shirt and trunk = $240 - $210  This gives us:  $30  Therefore, a T-shirt costs $30 more than a trunk.
Response:  We know that for every t-shirt sold, Razorback Winkels makes $25 and for each pair of shorts sold they make $115. So if we have x number of t-shirts sold, then the total amount earned from selling t-shirts is 25x. Similarly, if we have y number of pairs of shorts sold, then the total amount earned from selling shorts is 115y. Now let's find out how much one shirt costs more than a t-shirt. To do this, we need to subtract the price of a t-shirt (which is $25) from the price of a shirt ($115). So, the difference between the cost of a shirt and a t-shirt is: $115 - $25 = $90. Therefore, a shirt costs $90 more than a t-shirt.
Response:  We know that they have five tables and ten chairs. To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we can divide the number of chairs (10) by the number of tables (5): 10 / 5 = 2. So, they have two more chairs than tables.
Response:  Since they want to hold the party in their backyard and have two tables with the same number of chairs, we can assume that each table has half of the total number of chairs. Therefore, if there are 12 chairs in total for both tables combined, then each table must have 6 chairs (since 12 / 2 = 6). So, there are 6 chairs at each table.
Response:  We know that there are 9 chairs in the backyard and we want to find out how many tables they have. Since each table has three chairs, we can deduce that there is one table for every 3 chairs. Therefore, if there are 9 chairs, there will be 9 / 3 = 3 tables in the backyard. So, the answer is 3 tables.
Response:  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then we can calculate the total number of chairs as follows:  Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table  In this case, the total number of tables is 11, so the number of chairs would be:  Number of chairs = 11 x 13  = 143 chairs. Therefore, they will have 143 chairs in their backyard.
Response:  We know that there are 10 sets of tables and each set has 6 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 10 x 6 = 60. Now, we are told that there are 11 people sitting on the chairs, so the number of empty chairs is 11 - 60 = -50. Therefore, there are 50 empty chairs.
Response:  We know that they have 12 sets of tables and each set has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Then we are told that there are also 6 extra chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs for the guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  We know that there are four sets of tables and each set has three chairs. So, we need to find out how many sets of chairs they will buy if there are 14 people coming for the party.  To do this, we can use multiplication. If there are 14 people coming, then the total number of chairs needed is equal to 14 x 3 = 42 chairs. Therefore, they will have to buy 42 extra chairs for the party.
Response:  If they have 9 tables and each table has 14 chairs, then we can calculate how many chairs they have as follows: Number of chairs = Total number of tables x Number of chairs per table So, if they have 9 tables, then the total number of tables is 9. And if each table has 14 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. Therefore, they have 126 chairs.
Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in five weeks, that means he earned $92 per week ($460 / 5 = $92).
"Response:  We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest. If he earns $16 per week, then the number of weeks he worked is given by:

$1216 / $16 = 78 weeks

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 78 weeks."
"Response:  During the harvest season of 216 weeks, Lewis earns $21 per week, so he has earned a total amount of:

$$ Total Earnings = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings $$

Total Earning$= 216 weeks \times $21/week=$4392

Now, Lewis needs to pay taxes of $702, which is equivalent to:

$$ Tax Amount = Total Earnings \div Tax Rate $$

Tax Amount = $4392 / 0.25 (tax rate) = $1796

So, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis will have $4392 - $1796 = $2606 left after paying his taxes."
"Response:  If Lewis earns $ 1357 per week during an oyster season of 223 weeks, then he has earned in total:
$$ \text {Total income} = \text {Weekly income} \times \text{Number of weeks} $$
$$ \text {Total income} = \$ 1357 \times 223 \text{ weeks} = \$ 304,910 $$
Now, if he works for 73 oyster seasons, his total income will be:
$$ \text {Total income (for 73 seasons)} = \text {Total income from one season} \times \text {Number of seasons} $$
$$ \text {Total income (for 73 seasons)} = \$ 304,910 \times 73 = \$ 22,683,330 $$
Therefore, Lewis would have earned approximately $ 22,683,330 working for 73 oyster seasons at a weekly income of $ 1357."
Response:  During the harvest season (weeks 1-52), Lewis earns $28/week. For overtime work (weeks 53-1091), he earns $939/week. If he works overtime every week during the harvest season, his total earnings for that period would be: Total earnings = Overtime earnings x Number of weeks worked = $939/week x 46 weeks = $4,374 During this time, he also earned $28/week during the regular working hours, so his total earnings during the harvest season are: Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings = $28/week x 46 weeks + $4,374 = $4,402 Therefore, if he works overtime every week during the harvest season, his total earnings will be $4,402.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $403 per week during the harvest season of 23 weeks and he has to pay $49 per week for something, then his total income during that period is:
$$ Total Income = Weekly Earnings \times Number of Weeks $$
Total Income = $403 \times 23 = $9,290
So, Lewis earns $9,290 during the harvest season."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lewis earns $368 per week during the harvest season of 1359 weeks. Secondly, he has to pay rent of $388 every week. Now, let's calculate how much money he pays as rent during the harvest season: Total amount paid as rent = Number of weeks x Rent per week Total amount paid as rent = 1359 x $388 Total amount paid as rent = $524,702 So, Lewis pays $524,702 as rent during the harvest season.
Response:  During the harvest season (weeks), Lewis earns $491 per week. Therefore, his total income during the harvest season is: $$ Total Income = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Earnings = 1181 \times 491 = 573,091 dollars$$ Now, he has to pay $216 in rent every week. So, his total rent paid during the harvest season is: $$Total Rent = Number of Weeks \times Weekly Rent = 1181 \times 216 = 255,616 dollars$$Now, we need to find out how much money Lewis has left after paying the rent. To do this, subtract the amount he paid in rent from his total income: $$Money Left = Total Income - Total Rent = 573,091 - 255,616 = 317,475 dollars$$Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, Lewis has $317,475 left.
Response:  We know that Lewis earned $133 in total over 19 weeks. To find out how much he earns per week, we can divide the total amount he earned by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week.
"Response:  If Lewis earns $2 per week during harvest and he earned a total of $178, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many weeks Lewis worked during harvest.
We know that Lewis earned $2 per week during harvest, so his total earnings for the season are:
$$ Total = \text {Number of weeks} \times \text {Weekly income} $$
Given that Lewis earned a total of $178, we can set up an equation:
$$ 178 = x \times 2 $$
Where $x$ is the number of weeks Lewis worked during harvest.
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$ x = 178 / 2 = 89 $$
So, Lewis worked for 89 weeks during the harvest season.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

Lewis worked during the harvest season for 89 weeks."
"Response:  If the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height and he stands at 9 feet tall, then we can calculate the depth of the water as follows:
Depth = 10 x Height = 10 x 9 = 90 feet
Therefore, the depth of the water is 90 feet deeper than Dean's height."
Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters shorter than Ron, so Dean is 2 meters + 2 = 4 meters shorter than Ron.  Since they both decided to swim after a break, we can assume that their starting point (0 meter) is also the same for both of them. So, if Ron is at 4 meters deep in the water, then Dean must be at -2 meters (-4 meters minus 2 meters). Now, since we know that the depth of the water is two times Dean's height, we can conclude that the depth of the water is 2 x 2.5 = 5 meters. Therefore, the answer is 5 meters.
Response:  We know that Ron is 5 feet tall (60 inches). Since Dean is three meters shorter than Ron, Dean is 3 x 3 = 9 meters shorter than Ron. So, if Ron is at a depth of 12 feet, then he must be below the surface of the water by 12 - 5 = 7 feet. Therefore, the depth of the water is 7 x 5 = 35 feet.
Response:  We know that Dean is 1,20 m (or 1.20 meters) taller than Ron. So if Ron is at a depth of x meters, then Dean will be at a depth of x + 1.20 meters. Now we are told that the deepest point in the pool is 15 times Dean's height above sea level. Therefore, the deepest point in the pool is equal to 15(x+1.20). Since we want to find out how deep the water is when Ron is standing at 4 meters, we can set up an equation using this information: 4 = 15(x+1.20). Solving for x gives us x = -3.60. So the water was 3.60 meters deep when Ron was standing at 4 meters.
"Response:  We know that Dean is 2 meters taller than Ron, so if Ron is at a depth of x meters, then Dean will be at a depth of x + 2 meters. Since they both want to swim in deep water, we can assume that the depth of the water is greater than or equal to 8 meters (since this is the highest depth that either of them could reach). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + 2 = 8... (1)
Now, since Ron wants to swim in deep water, he must be able to stand at least partially submerged in the water. So, we know that his height (which is 1.75 meters) plus the depth of the water minus 2 equals zero:
1.75 + x - 2 = 0... (2)
We can now solve for x using equations (1) and (2):
x = 8 - 2 = 6 meters
So, when Ron stands at a depth of 4 meters, the water is 6 meters deep."
Response:  We know that the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. So if Dean is 1 meter tall (which means he is 100 cm), then the depth of the water is 900 cm (9 x 100).
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and he wants to divide them equally among 2 bookshelves, then each shelf will have 34/2 = 17 books.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books and each bookshelf contains 2 books, then he has 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves. Therefore, he has 21 bookshelves.
"Response:  If Brian has 27 books and 80 magazines in each of his 23 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

27 x 23 = 611 books

So, Brian has 611 books in total."
"Response:  If Brian has 9 books and 46 magazines in each of his 10 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

9 x 46 = 424 magazines

So, Brian has 424 magazines in total."
"Response:  If Brian has 23 books and 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, then he has a total of:

* 23 x 29 = 647 books
* 61 x 29 = 1709 magazines

So, Brian has a total of 647 books and 1709 magazines."
Response:  If Brian has seven bookshelves with the same number of books, then he must have 7 x 28 = 196 books in total. Since each shelf has the same number of books, we can divide the total number of books by 7 to find out how many books are in each shelf: 196 / 7 = 28 books per shelf.
Response:  If Brian has 38 books and each bookshelf contains two books, then he must have 19 bookshelves (38 / 2 = 19).
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to ten friends and each package contains two invitations, then she needs a total of 20 packages (10 x 2 = 20). Therefore, she has to buy 20 packages of invitations.
Response:  If Carol sent out invitations to 12 friends, then there are 12 invitations total. Since she bought three packages with each containing the same number of invitations, we can assume that each package contains 12/3 = 4 invitations. Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each package.
Response:  We know that Carol bought seven packets of invitations and each packet contains ten invitations. So, in total, she has 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. If she sends two invitations to her friends, then there are 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left. Therefore, the answer is 68.
Response:  We know that Carol bought 6 packs of invitations and each pack contains 14 invitations. So, she has bought a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. Then, we are told that she also bought 11 additional invitations. Therefore, in total, Carol can invite 84 + 11 = 95 friends to her party.
Response:  If Carol bought two packets of invitations and each packet has three invitations inside, then she will have a total of six invitations (2 x 3 = 6).  Since she is inviting nine friends in total, she needs to buy an additional three invitations (9 - 6 = 3) to cover all her guests. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.
Response:  If Melissa scored 12 points per game and she scored 36 points altogether, then we can write an equation as follows:  Points = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question into this equation, we get:  Points = 36 / 3 = 12 Wedstrijden Therefore, according to the information provided, Melissa played 12 games.
Response:  We know that Melissa played 3 games and scored a total of 81 points. To find out how many points she scored in each game, we can divide the total number of points she scored (81) by the number of games she played (3). So, Melissa scored 27 points per game.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 109 points per game and received 82 bonus points per game. To find out how many points she scored in total, we can multiply her score per game by the number of games she played:  Total points = Score per game x Number of games played  In this case, Melissa played 79 games, so we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the total points:  Total points = 109 x 79 = 8611  So, Melissa scored 8611 points in total.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored 21 points in total and she scored 7 points per game. So we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game Now we need to find out how many games Melissa played. To do this, we divide her total score by her score per game: Number of games = Total score / Score per game = 21 / 7 = 3 Therefore, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  We know that Melissa scored a total of 91 points in 13 games. To find out how many points she scored in each game, we can divide her total score by the number of games she played. So, if we divide 91 by 13, we get an average of 7 points per game. Therefore, Melissa scored 7 points in every game.
Response:  The big wheel has 4 seats and can accommodate 20 people at once. Therefore, each seat can hold 5 people (20/4 = 5).
Response:  If 18 people can ride at once and each seat can hold 9 people, then we have to divide 18 by 9 to find out how many seats there are. So, the number of seats is 18/9 = 2. Therefore, the giant wheel has 2 seats.
Response:  We know that each reuzenrad has 19 seats and can accommodate 15 people per seat. Therefore, we need to divide 20 (the number of reuzenrads) by 15 (the capacity of one seat). So, the answer is: 20 / 15 = 133 people.
Response:  If there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then we have: Total number of people who can ride at once = Number of available seats x Capacity per seatTotal number of people who can ride at once = 18 x 15Total number of people who can ride at once = 270So, 270 people can ride on the giant wheel at the same time.
"Response:  If there are already 16 people sitting on the wheel and it has a total of 6 seats, then we can calculate how many more people can fit on the wheel as follows:

Total number of people = Number of seats x Capacity per seat
= 6 x 14
= 84

So, there can be up to 84 more people who can fit on the wheel besides the 16 people who are already sitting on it."
Response:  We know that there are 2 small chairs and 23 large chairs in total. If we divide the number of seats available for small chairs (2) by the maximum capacity per chair (14), we get: Number of people who can ride on small chairs = 2 / 14 = 0.14 or 14 people. Now, if we multiply this number by the total number of chairs (23), we get: Total number of people who can ride on small chairs = 0.14 x 23 = 3.2. So, up to 32 people can ride on the small chairs.  But wait! There's more! Since each large chair can accommodate 54 people, we can also calculate how many people can ride on them: Number of people who can ride on large chairs = 23 / 54 = 0.42 or 42 people. Therefore, the total number of people who can ride on both types of chairs is: Total number of people who can ride on both types of chairs = 32 + 42 = 74 people.
Response:  We know that there are 3 small chairs and 7 large chairs available for people to ride on the giant wheel. Each small chair can accommodate 16 people, while each large chair can accommodate 12 people. Therefore, we need to find out how many people can fit on the large chairs. Since there are 7 large chairs, we can have up to 84 people (7 x 12 = 84) ride on them at once. So, in total, the number of people who can ride on the giant wheel is 84 + 16 = 100.
Response:  If 16 people can ride on the giant wheel at the same time and it has 4 seats per car, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people each seat can accommodate. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  If four people can simultaneously ride on the giant wheel in Paradise Park, and each seat on the giant wheel can hold two people, then we need to know how many seats are available on the giant wheel. So, the number of seats on the giant wheel is equal to the number of people who can ride it at once. Therefore, the number of seats on the giant wheel is 4 (people). Since each seat can hold two people, the total number of seats on the giant wheel is 2 x 4 = 8. Hence, the giant wheel has 8 seats.
Response:  If we have ordered 7 pizzas and each pizza has the same number of slices, then there are 7 x Number of slices per pizza = Total number of slices. Since there are 14 total slices, if we divide that by 7, we get the number of slices per pizza = 14 / 7 = 2 slices per pizza.
Response:  If there are 28 pieces of cheese and each pizza has two slices, then how many pizzas have we ordered?  To find out, divide the total number of pieces of cheese (28) by the number of slices per pizza (2). This gives us 14 pizzas. Therefore, we have ordered 14 pizzas.
Response:  If there are 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices, then the total number of slices is: 17 x 4 = 68 slices. Since there are 25 people, they will get to eat 68 / 25 = 2.72 pizzas each. So, there are 2.72 pizzas in total.
Response:  If there are nine pizzas and each pizza has ten slices, then the total number of slices is 9 x 10 = 90 slices. Since you are going with two people, you will get half of those slices, which is 90 / 2 = 45 slices per person. So, you will have 45 slices of pizza in total.
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 45 bedding containers, then they have planted a total of 10 x 45 = 450 seeds.
Response:  If they planted 45 seeds in total and divided them equally among 9 beds, then each bed contains how many seeds?  We can solve this problem using division.  Number of seeds per bed = Total number of seeds / Number of beds So, if they planted 45 seeds in total and divided them equally among 9 beds, then the number of seeds in each bed is: Number of seeds per bed = 45 / 9 = 5 seeds per bed. Therefore, they have 5 seeds in each of the 9 beds.
Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. Since only 58 seeds grew into plants in each bed, we can deduce that there were 12 beds (since 58 / 4 = 12). So, Paige and her mother had 12 flowerbeds.
"Response:  We know that Paige helped her mother plant 55 seeds and together they planted 15 seeds in each of 3 bloembeds. So, we have:
Number of seeds planted = 55 + (3 x 15) = 75
Now, we know that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in all three bloembeds. Therefore, the number of flowers grown is:
Flowers grown = Number of seeds planted - Number of seeds that did not grow = 75 - 60 = 15
So, there were 15 flowers grown in total."
Response:  If Paige and her mother planted 10 seeds in each of 5 bedding plants, then they have planted a total of 5 x 10 = 50 seeds.  If they now want to plant 60 more seeds, that means they will need 60 / 10 = 6 additional bedding plants. So, after planting all 60 seeds, they will have used up 5 + 6 = 11 bedding plants. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  If Paige helped her mother plant flowers in 8 flower beds and they have a total of 32 seeds to plant, then each flower bed has an equal number of seeds (i.e., 4 seeds per flower bed). Therefore, if they planted the same number of seeds in every flower bed, they would have planted 4 x 8 = 32 seeds in all 8 flower beds combined.
Response:  If Matthew gave away 2 crackers to his 11 friends, then he has X - 2 crackers left. Since he started with 5 crackers (Matthew had 5 crackers), we can write an equation: X = 5 - 2 = 3. So, Matthew had 3 crackers left after giving some away to his friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave eight crackers to his friends and he gave two crackers to each of his friends, then he gave a total of 8 x 2 = 16 crackers to his friends. Therefore, Matthew gave crackers to four friends.
"Response:  If Matthew gave each of his five friends an equal number of crackers (since he gave them all ""evenveel""), then each friend must have received 3 crackers ( since there are 15 crackers in total and 5 friends). So, if Matthew started with 15 crackers and gave each friend 3 crackers, then he would have been left with 10 crackers (the remaining amount after giving away 3 crackers to each of his 5 friends). Therefore, each friend has eaten 3 crackers."
Response:  First, we know that Matthew gave some crackers to his friends and he was left with 17 crackers. So, let's say he gave x crackers to his friends. Then, we can write an equation based on this information:  Number of crackers Matthew has = 24 - x  Now, we are told that there were still 17 crackers left after Matthew gave them to his friends. So, we can substitute this value into our equation: 24 - x = 17  Solving for x, we get: x = 7  Therefore, Matthew gave 7 crackers to his friends.
"Response:  We know that Matthew has 22 crackers and 34 tarts. If he gives each of his 11 friends an equal amount of both crackers and tarts, then...

$$ \text {Number of crackers} = \frac{\text{Total number of crackers}}{ \text{Number of friends}} $$

$$ \text {Number of tarts} = \frac{\text{Total number of tarts}}{ \text{Number of friends}} $$

Now we can plug in the values given in the question:

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of crackers}} = \frac{22}{11} = 2 } $$

$$ \boxed{\text{Number of tarts}} = \frac{34}{11} = 3 } $$

So each person gets $2$ crackers and $3$ tarts."
Response:  If Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to each of his two friends, then he gave 14 crackers to one friend and 15 crackers to the other (since he has 29 crackers in total). Therefore, if Matthew gave even more cake pieces to each of his friends than he did crackers, then each friend would have eaten half as much cake as they ate crackers. So, if one friend ate 14/2 = 7 cake pieces, then the other friend ate 15/2 = 7.5 cake pieces.
"Response:  We know that Matthew has 14 crackers and 21 tarts. If he wants to give an equal amount of crackers and tarts to his 7 friends, we can start by dividing the total number of crackers and tarts equally among the 7 friends. So, each friend will get:
Crackers: 14 / 7 = 2 crackers per person
Tarts: 21 / 7 = 3 tarts per person
Therefore, each person will receive 2 crackers and 3 tarts."
Response:  If Matthew gave away all of his 36 crackers to his 18 friends, then each friend got an equal number of crackers (i.e., 36 / 18 = x). Since Matthew had 36 crackers initially and gave them all away, we know that x is also the number of crackers Matthew gave away. Therefore, the answer is x = 2.
Response:  If Matthew gave 6 crackers to each of his friends, then he has given a total of 6 x 5 = 30 crackers away. So, he still has 36 - 30 = 6 crackers left with him. Therefore, he gave crackers to 6 friends.
Response:  Matthew has 23 crackers and gives an equal number to his two friends. So he gave 11 crackers to each friend (since he has 2 friends). Now, let's check how many crackers each friend has left after eating their share of crackers. Friend A has 11 crackers - 5 = 6 crackers left. Friend B has 11 crackers - 4 = 7 crackers left. Therefore, each friend has 6 or 7 crackers left.
Response:  We know that Matthew has 31 crackers initially and he gives an equal number to his 5 friends. So, if he gave crackers to his friends, then he will have less crackers left with him.  Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:  Number of crackers Matthew has = Initial number of crackers - Number of crackers given to friends  Now, let's substitute the values in the equation:  Number of crackers Matthew has = 31 - x (where x is the number of crackers given to friends)  Since Matthew has 23 crackers left after giving some to his friends, we can find the value of 'x' by using the information provided in the question:  Number of crackers Matthew has = 31 - 23  Solving for 'x', we get:  x = 9  Therefore, Matthew gave 9 crackers to his 5 friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave out even more crackers and cakes to his four friends, then he must have given them in equal shares. So, if he gave 32 crackers to each of his four friends, that means he gave a total of 128 crackers (32 x 4). Similarly, if he gave 98 tarts to all of them together, it means he gave 24 tarts per friend (98 / 4 = 24). Therefore, Matthew gave 128 crackers and 24 tarts to each of his four friends.
Response:  If Matthew gave out even more crackers and cakes to his four friends, then he must have given them in equal shares. So each friend got an equal number of crackers and cakes.  Since there are 10 crackers and 8 tarts in total, if one person gets x crackers, then the other three get 3x/4 crackers each. Similarly, if one person gets y tarts, then the other three get 2y/3 tarts each.  Now we can use these ratios to find out how many tarts each person got. For example, if one person got 5 tarts, then the other three got 3(5)/4 = 7.5 tarts each.  Therefore, each person got 7.5 tarts.
Response:  If Matthew gave away $even$ crackers and $cake$ to his $28$ friends, then he must have had $\frac{even}{28}$ crackers and $\frac{cake}{28}$ cakes initially. Since he gave away $13$ crackers and $15$ tarts, each friend got $\frac{13}{28}$ crackers and $\frac{15}{28}$ tarts. Therefore, each person got $\boxed{\frac{13}{28}}$ crackers and $\boxed{\frac{15}{28}}$ tarts.
"Response:  We know that Debbie bought some water bottles when they were on sale and she drank 109 bottles per day. If the bottles lasted for 74 days, then we can calculate how many bottles she bought as follows:

Total number of days = 74 days
Number of bottles drunk per day = 109 bottles/day
Therefore, total number of bottles = Total number of days x Number of bottles drunk per day
= 74 days x 109 bottles/day
= 8,263 bottles
So, Debbie bought 8,263 water bottles when they were on sale."
Response:  If Debbie bought 153 water bottles when they were on sale and she drank the same number of bottles every day, then we can assume that she drank 153/17 = 8.94 bottles per day. So, Debbie drank approximately 9 bottles of water per day.
"Response:  If she bought 264 water bottles when they were on sale and consumed 15 bottles per day for 11 days, we can calculate how many bottles she has left as follows:

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles purchased x Number of days used
= 264 x 11
= 2910

So, Debbie has 2910 water bottles left."
Response:  We know that Debbie has drunk 301 water bottles in total and she drank 144 bottles per day. So we can write an equation as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of days x Number of bottles per day  Total number of bottles = 301 = (Number of days) x (144) Now we need to find out how many days Debbie drank water. To do this, we divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles she drank per day: Number of days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles per day Number of days = 301 / 144 Number of days = 2  Therefore, Debbie drank water for 2 days.
"Response:  If Debbie buys 88 water bottles and 13 juice bottles when they are on sale, that means she has a total of 101 bottles (88 water + 13 juice).  If she drinks 4 water bottles and 87 juice bottles per day, we can calculate how many days the water bottles would last as follows:

Days = Total number of bottles / Number of bottles drunk per day
= 101 / 4
= 25.25 days
So, the water bottles would last for approximately 25-26 days."
Response:  If Debbie buys 200 water bottles and 256 fruit juice bottles when they are on sale, that means she has a total of 456 bottles (200 + 256 = 456).  If she drinks 312 water bottles and 4 fruit juice bottles per day, then the number of days it would take for her to finish the fruit juice bottles is calculated as follows:  Number of days = Total number of fruit juice bottles / Daily consumption of fruit juice bottles = 256 / 4 = 64 days Therefore, the fruit juice bottles will last Debbie for approximately 64 days.
"Response:  If Debbie drinks 6 bottles of water per day and buys 12 bottles of water, she will have enough for how many days?

Let X be the number of days that Debbie can use the 12 bottles of water. Since she drinks 6 bottles per day, we know that X - 6 = Number of days Debbie has left after using up all 12 bottles.
We are given that Debbie has 12 bottles of water, so the maximum value of X is 12. Therefore, the answer is:
X = 12
Debbie can use the 12 bottles of water for 12 days."
Response:  If Debbie buys 95 bottles of Frisk and 180 water bottles when they are on sale, then she has a total of 275 bottles (95 + 180).  If she consumes 15 water bottles and 54 Frisk bottles per day, it means that she will finish all her water bottles in 3 days (15 x 3 = 45) and all her Frisk bottles in 6 days (54 / 9 = 6). Therefore, the water bottles would last for 3 days.
Response:  If Debbie bought 360 bottles of soda and 162 bottles of water when they were on sale, that means she has a total of 522 bottles (360 + 162).  If she drinks 122 bottles of water and 9 bottles of soda per day, it will take her approximately 4 days to finish all the bottles (122 / 12 = 10 days, but we round up since there are no remainders). So, the number of days it would take for the bottles to go through is 4 days.
Response:  We know that Faye placed her pencils in 14 rows with 11 pencils in each row. So, we can write this as an equation: 14 x 11 =.... Can you solve for the total number of pencils?
Response:  We know that Faye has placed 12 potatoes equally in 3 rows. Since there are 4 rows in total (including the middle row), each row contains 3 potatoes. Therefore, Faye has placed 3 x 3 = 9 potatoes in each row. So, she has placed 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 potatoes in all three rows combined.
Response:  We know that Faye has 28 dozen potatoes (which is equal to 28 x 12 = 336). Since she wants to arrange them in rows of 16 potatoes each, we can divide 336 by 16 to find out how many rows she can make: 336 / 16 = 21 rows. Therefore, Faye can make 21 rows with her potatoes.
Response:  We know that Faye has six packs of potatoes with 14 potatoes in each pack. Therefore, she has a total of 6 x 14 = 84 potatoes. Since she arranged them in rows of 22 potatoes each, we can conclude that she has 84 / 22 = 39 rows of potatoes. So, Faye has 39 rows of potatoes in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 potatoes and 7 colorful potatoes. If she wants to arrange them in rows, we need to divide them equally among the rows. So, if she makes one row with 5 potatoes, then she can make 35 / 5 = 7 rows of potatoes. Since she also has 7 colorful potatoes, she can make 7 rows of those as well. Therefore, Faye can make 7 + 7 = 14 rows in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and crayons in 19 rows with 4 pencils and 27 crayons in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Number of pencils = Total number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 19 x 4 = 76 Pencils Now, let's find out how many crayons Faye has: Number of crayons = Total number of rows x Number of crayons per row = 19 x 27 = 503 Crayons So, to summarize, Faye has 76 pencils and 503 crayons in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her potatoes and colorful pencils in seven rows with 36 potatoes and 30 colored pencils in each row. So, we can write this as an equation: Row 1: Potatoes = 36 + Colored Pencils = 30 Row 2: Potatoes = 36 + Colored Pencils = 30... Row 7: Potatoes = 36 + Colored Pencils = 30 Since there are seven rows, the total number of colored pencils is equal to 7 x 30 = 210. Therefore, Faye has 210 colored pencils.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her potatoes and colorful pencils in 11 rows with 31 potatoes and 27 colorful pencils in each row. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:  Total number of potatoes = Number of rows x Number of potatoes per row  Total number of colorful pencils = Number of rows x Number of colorful pencils per row  Now let's substitute the values given in the question into these equations:  Total number of potatoes = 11 x 31 = 341  Total number of colorful pencils = 11 x 27 = 297  So, Faye has a total of 341 potatoes and 297 colorful pencils.
Response:  If Faye has placed 30 potatoes in rows with 5 potatoes in each row, then she can make... See More $$$ \boxed{6} $$$ rows. Therefore, the answer is $6$.
Response:  If Faye has 6 potatoes and she wants to place them in two rows of equal length, then we can assume that she will divide them equally between the two rows. So, if she places 3 potatoes in each row, then she will have placed 6/2 = 3 potatoes in each row. Therefore, Faye has placed 3 potatoes in each row.
Response:  We know that Faye has 35 dozen potatoes (which is equal to 35 x 12 = 420). Elke potato had 4 potatoes inside it, so we can write this as: 420 - 4(potatoes inside each potato) = number of rows Faye could make. Since there are 4 potatoes inside each potato, we have: 420 - 16 = number of rows Faye could make. Therefore, Faye could make 420 / 16 = 27 rows.
Response:  We know that Faye has 31 packages of cookies, and each package contains 6 cookies. So, we can write this as an equation: 31 = x + y, where x is the number of rows of cookies and y is the number of cookies in each row. Since there are 19 cookies in each row, we can write: x = 19. Now, we have two equations: 31 = x + y and x = 19. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the value of y = 42 (since x + y = 31). Therefore, Faye has 42 cookies in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her pencils and crayons in 30 rows with 71 pencils and 24 crayons in each row. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pencils as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 30 x 71 = 2100 pencils Similarly, we can calculate the total number of crayons as follows: Total number of crayons = Number of rows x Number of crayons per row = 30 x 24 = 720 crayons So, to answer your question, Faye has 2100 pencils and 720 crayons in total.
Response:  We know that Faye has placed her potatoes and colorful pencils in 16 rows with 6 pencils and 21 pencils in each row. So, we need to find out how many colors there are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row. Therefore, the total number of colors is:  Number of rows x Number of pencils per row = 16 x 21 = 320.  Hence, Faye has 320 colorful pencils.
Response:  We know that there are 7 schoolbuses and each bus can seat how many students?  Since there are 98 students attending school, if all the buses are full, then we need to divide the total number of students (98) by the number of seats available per bus (which we will find out later). So, the answer is:  Number of zitplaatsen = Total number of students / Number of seats per bus  Now let's calculate the number of seats per bus:  Since there are 7 schoolbuses, and each bus has 21 clasrooms, we can assume that each bus can accommodate approximately 3 students per classroom (since each classroom has an average capacity of 6-8 students). Therefore, the number of seats per bus is:  Number of seats per bus = Total number of classes / Number of students per classroom x Number of students per bus  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Number of seats per bus = 21 classes / 3 students/classroom x 7 buses  Simplifying and solving for 'Number of seats per bus', we get:  Number of seats per bus = 70 seats  Therefore, if all the buses are full, then there are 70 zitplaatsen in each bus.
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in total and each classroom can accommodate 30 students on average (a rough estimate). So, we have:
Number of classrooms = 84
Average number of students per classroom = 30
Now, let's calculate the total number of students based on the number of buses and seats available:
Total number of buses = 95
Seating capacity per bus = 118 (on average)
Total number of students who can be transported daily = Total number of buses x Seating capacity per bus
= 95 x 118
= 11,270
So, there are approximately 11,270 students attending this school."
Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms and 66 students per classroom. Therefore, we need to divide the number of students (66 x 67 = 4052) by the number of seats available in each bus (6). So, we need 4052 / 6 = 698 buses to transport all the students.
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in total and each classroom has the same number of students (58). Therefore, we can assume that each bus will carry an equal number of students as well. So, if one bus can accommodate 2 students, then we need $ \frac {87}{2} = 43.5$ buses to transport all the students from their respective classrooms to the destination. Since we cannot have a fraction of a bus, we round up to $ 44 $ buses needed for this trip.
"Response:  We know that there are 120 students at the school and each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, we can assume that there are 120/24 = 5 stud... (read more)

Solution: Based on the information provided in the question, we can determine the number of students in each class as follows:

Let's think step by step:

We know that there are 120 students at the school, and each classroom has the same number of students. Therefore, we can assume that there are 120/24 = 5 students in each classroom.

Since there are 24 classrooms, the total number of students in the school is 120 x 24 = 2880 students.

So, there are 2880 students in the school, with an average of 5 students per classroom."
"Response:  We know that there are 102 students attending this school and each bus can seat 8 students. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to find out how many buses are needed:

102 students / 8 seats per bus = 13 buses
So, there would be 13 school buses needed if 22 students do not want to go to school."
Response:  We know that there are 102 classrooms in the school and 11 students in total. If 8 of them do not want to go on the trip, then we have 102 - 8 = 94 remaining students who will go on the trip. Therefore, 94 students will go on the trip.
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in total and each classroom can accommodate 30 students (as mentioned in the problem statement). Therefore, we need to divide the number of students by 30 to find out how many classes we have. So, the number of classes = Number of students / Seating capacity per classroom = 111 students / 30 students/classroom = 36 classes. Since each bus can accommodate 30 students, we will need 36/30 = 4 buses to transport all the students to school. Therefore, there are 4 school buses needed to take all the students to school.
Response:  We know that there are 46 schoolbuses and 92 students attending school. If all of the buses are full, then each bus can seat how many students?  To find out, we need to divide the number of students (92) by the number of buses (46). So, each bus can seat approximately 2 students. Therefore, if all buses are full, there will be 92 x 2 = 184 zitplaatsen in total.
Response:  If there are 11 boys in class 11 who like to play marbles and Haley gives each boy 9 knick-knacks, then we can calculate how many knick-knacks Haley has given in total as follows: Total number of knick-knacks = Number of boys x Number of knick-knacks per boy Total number of knick-knacks = 11 x 9 = 99 knick-knacks Therefore, Haley has given 99 knick-knacks to the boys in her class.
Response:  If Haley has 10 knick-knacks and gives 5 to each of the boys, then she will give a total of 5 x 4 = 20 knick-knacks away. So, Haley gave 20 knick-knacks to the boys.
Response:  If there are 4 boys in class who want to play marbles and Haley has 23 marbles, then each boy will get 23/4 = 5.75 marbles. Since you can't have a fraction of a marble, each boy will get 6 marbles. Therefore, the number of marbles the boys will get is 6 x 4 = 24 marbles.
Response:  If 13 boys want to play knick-knack and 50 boys want to play cards, then together they have 13 + 50 = 63 pieces of candy or other small items that they can share equally among themselves. So each boy will get 63 / 63 = 1 piece of candy.
Response:  If Haley has 20 knickers and she divides them equally among her classmates, then each of her classmates will get 20/x knickers, where x is the number of classmates. Since there are 5 boys in the class, we can assume that they make up half of the total number of classmates (i.e., 5/10 = 0.5). So, if Haley gives away all of her knickers equally to her classmates, each boy will receive 20/0.5 = 40 knickers.
Response:  If Haley has 28 knick-knacks and wants to give some to each of the boys in her class, then she will have to divide 28 by the number of boys in her class. So, if there are x boys in her class, Haley will give 28/x knick-knacks to each boy.
"Response:  We know that Frank liked his favorite book and he read it for 14 days. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Days = Total pages / Number of days

We are given that the total number of pages in the book is 392, and Frank read 14 pages per day. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation to solve for ""Days"":

Days = 392 / 14

Simplifying this equation gives us:

Days = 27

Therefore, Frank needed 27 days to finish reading his favorite book."
Response:  We know that Frank read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish his favorite book. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day So, plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Number of pages = 569 x 22 = 12380 pages Hence, the favorite book had 12380 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took six days to finish reading his favorite book of 612 pages divided into 24 chapters. To find out how many pages he read each day, we can use the following formula: Number of pages read = Total number of pages / Number of days taken. In this case, the total number of pages is 612 and the number of days taken is 6. So, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Number of pages read = 612 / 6 = 102 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 102 pages per day.
"Response:  We know that Frank took 220 days to finish his favorite book and it has 555 pages in total. Since there are 5 chapters in the book, we can calculate how many pages each chapter contains as follows:

Total number of pages = Number of pages per chapter x Number of chapters
= 555 pages x 5 chapters
= 2775 pages

Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days Frank took to finish the book to find out how many pages he read every day:

Number of pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 2775 pages / 220 days
= 12.43 pages/day

Therefore, there are approximately 12.43 pages in each chapter of Frank's favorite book."
"Response:  We know that Frank took 660 days to finish his favorite book and it has 15 chapters or sections. Therefore, we can calculate how many days he spent reading each chapter as follows:

Total number of days = Total number of pages / Number of chapters
= 193 pages / 15 chapters
= 12.87 days per chapter (round up to nearest whole number)

Now, let's find out how many pages Frank read per day:

Pages read per day = Total number of pages / Number of days taken
= 193 pages / 660 days
= 0.29 pages per day (round down to nearest whole number)

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.29 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took three days to finish each book and there are 3 books in total. So, he spent 3 x 3 = 9 days reading altogether. Now, we need to find out how many pages he read per day. Since each book has 249 pages, Frank read 249 pages / 3 books = 86 pages per book. He read 86 pages/book x 9 days = 754 pages overall. Therefore, Frank read 754 pages / 9 days = 83 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank takes 12 days to read each book and he has already read 49 books. Therefore, it will take him 492 / 12 = 40 days to read all 50 books. So, Frank has read 50 - 49 = 1 book in total.
Response:  We know that it took Frank 16 days to finish his favorite book and we also know that the book has 112 pages. So, if he finished the book in 16 days, then he must have read how many pages per day? To find out, we can divide the number of pages in the book (112) by the number of days it took him to finish the book (16): 112 / 16 = 7 pages per day. Therefore, Frank read 7 pages of his favorite book every day.
"Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages per day and the book has 576 pages in total, then he will finish reading it in:

Days = Total pages / Daily pages
= 576 / 8
= 72 days
Therefore, Frank will take approximately 72 days to read his favorite book if he reads 8 pages per day."
Response:  We know that Frank took 30 days to finish his favorite book and each chapter has 450 pages. So, he read 450 pages/day x 30 days = 13,500 pages in total.
Response:  We know that Frank took 607 days to finish his favorite book. Since each chapter has 3 sections, we can assume that each section takes approximately 201 days (607 / 3 = 201). Therefore, there are 594 pages in each chapter since each chapter consists of three sections with 594 pages per section. So, the total number of pages in each chapter is 594 x 3 = 1782 pages.  Now, let's calculate the total number of pages in the entire book: Total pages = Number of chapters x Number of pages per chapter = 3 x 1782 = 5346 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank took 664 days to finish his favorite book. If we divide this number by the total number of pages in the book (2 x 405 = 810), we get the average number of pages he read per day: 810 / 664 = 1.25 pages/day. So, Frank read approximately 1.25 pages of his favorite book every day.
Response:  If you can buy 5 DVDs for $60, then each DVD costs $60 / 5 = $12 per DVD. Therefore, each package of 5 DVDs costs $12 x 5 = $60. So, each individual DVD costs $60 / 5 = $12.
Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages would cost:  33 x $81 = $2693.
"Response:  If each DVD costs $107 and there is a discount of $106 off each package, then we can calculate how many packages you can buy with $93 as follows:

$93 / $106 = x
x = 8
So, you can buy 8 packages of DVDs with $93."
Response:  The cost of each DVD is $76. If there is a discount of $25 off each package, how much do you have to pay for each package? To find out, we need to subtract the discount from the original price. So, the amount you have to pay for each package = Original price - Discount = $76 - $25 = $51. Therefore, you have to pay $51 for each package.
"Response:  If you have $104 dollars and each package of DVDs costs $26, then...

Answer: You can buy $\boxed{4}$ packages of DVDs with your $104 dollars$."
Response:  If you can buy two DVD's for $28, that means each DVD costs half of that amount or $14.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in total and we want to group them into groups of size 2. So, we can start by dividing the 18 bananas into pairs. Since there are 18 bananas, we will have 9 pairs or 18 / 2 = 9 groups. Therefore, there are 9 groups of bananas.
"Response:  We know that there are bananas in Philip's collection and they are organized into groups of size 187. So, we can start counting from 1 to 187 for each group. Since there are 140 groups, the total number of bananas in Philip's collection is:
$$ \text {Total Number of Bananas} = 140 \times 187 = 25,900 $$
Therefore, Philip has $25,900$ bananas in his collection."
Response:  We know that there are 203 bananas and they are divided into 7 groups. Therefore, the number of bananas in each group is 203/7 = 29. So, each group contains 29 bananas. Similarly, we know that there are 63 sinaasappels and they are divided into 95 groups. Therefore, the number of sinaasappels in each group is 63/95 = 0.66. So, each group contains approximately 0.66 sinaasappels.
Response:  We know that there are 356 sinaasappels and we want to find out how many groups of sinaasapples there are. Since there are 142 bananas, each group of bananas contains 142/47 = 3 bananas. Therefore, there will be 356 / 178 = 2 groups of sinaasapples per group of bananas. So, there are 2 groups of sinaasapples for every group of bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 196 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. Therefore, we can write: Number of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of groups = 392 / 196 = 2 So, each group contains 2 bananas.
Response:  We know that there are 18 bananas in each group and we want to find out how many groups of bananas there are altogether. So, if there are 180 bananas in total, then the number of groups can be found as follows: Number of groups = Total number of bananas / Number of bananas per group = 180 / 18 = 10 groups Therefore, there are 10 groups of bananas in Philip's collection.
"Response:  We know that there are 290 bananas and we want to divide them into groups of size x.  Since there are 87 sinaasappels, we can use these as our ""divisor"" for dividing the bananas.  So, if we divide 290 bananas by 87 (the number of sinaasappels), we get:  Number of groups = 290 / 87 = 3.41 groups  Therefore, each group contains approximately 3.41 bananas."
Response:  We know that there are 384 sinaasappels and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the number of sinaasappels by the number of groups of sinaasapples (16), then each group has 24 sinaasappels. Similarly, if we divide the number of bananas by the number of groups of bananas (345), then each group has 27 bananas. Therefore, the size of each group of sinaasapples is 24, and the size of each group of bananas is 27.
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made 38 koekjes and each koekje has 19 pieces for guests, then she has made in total:

38 koekjes x 19 pieces per koekje = 701 pieces of koekjes
Therefore, Brenda's mother has made 701 pieces of koekjes for the guests."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made cookies for 14 people and each person got 30 cookies, then...

Answer: 14 x 30 = 420 cookies."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made cookies for five people and she made 22 cookies in total but had to throw away 17 of them, then we can calculate how many cookies each person got as follows:

Number of cookies per person = Total number of cookies / Number of people
= 22 / 5
= 4.4
So, each person got approximately 4.4 cookies."
"Response:  If Brenda's mother made koekjes for 10 guests and only 9 guests came, then she must have made more than enough koekjes to feed all of them. So let's assume that she made x koekjes in total. Now, if she made 18 koekjes per guest (including the extra guests), then we can write an equation as follows:
x + 18(9) = 10
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x = 72
So, Brenda's mother made 72 koekjes in total!"
Response:  If Brenda's mother made 14 cookies for 2 guests, that means she made 7 cookies per guest (since there are 2 guests). So if all of the cookies were equally divided among the guests, each guest would have received 7/2 = 3 and half cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies Brenda's mother made is 14 x 3 = 42 cookies.
Response:  If Brenda's mother made cookies for the guests and each guest received two cookies, then she must have baked 2 x number of guests = 20 cookies. Therefore, Brenda's mother has baked 20 cookies for 10 guests.
Response:  If Frank has 42 snoepjes and he wants to put them into two bags, then there will be an equal number of snoepjes in each bag. So, if we divide 42 by 2, we get 21 snoepjes per bag. Therefore, there are 21 snoepjes in each bag.
"Response:  We know that Frank has 26 bags of snacks and each bag contains 33 pieces of snacks. Therefore, the total number of snacks that Frank has is:

26 bags x 33 pieces per bag = 840 pieces of snacks
So, Frank has 840 snoepjes (Dutch for ""snacks"") in total."
Response:  We know that Frank initially had 33 pieces of snoopies and lost 24 pieces. So he has 33 - 24 = 9 pieces left. If he wants to put these pieces into bags with 9 pieces each, then he will have 9 / 9 = 1 bag. Therefore, Frank will have one bag.
Response:  If Frank has 11 snoopies in each bag and he has 22 snacks in total, that means he will have 22 / 11 = 2 bags of snacks. Therefore, Frank would have two bags.
Response:  If Frank has 16 snoopies and he divides them into two bags, then each bag must contain an equal number of snoopies. So if one bag contains x snoopies, the other bag will also contain x snoopies. Since there are 2 bags, we can write the equation: 2x = 16. Solving for x, we get that each bag contains 8 snoopies (2x = 16).
Response:  If Shirley sold 25 dozen of flowers with three-leafed petals, then she must have sold 3 × 25 = 75 bunches of flowers in total. Since each bunch contains 14 dozens, we can conclude that Shirley needs to deliver 75 × 14 = 1050 dozens of three-leafed flower bouquets.
Response:  If Shirley has sold ten dozens of three-dimensional flowers, that means she has sold 10 x 3 = 30 flowers in total. Now, if she needs to deliver five dozens, then she will need to deliver 5 / 3 = 1.67 dozens. Since we can't have a fraction of a dozen, Shirley will need to deliver 2 dozens of flowers in total.
Response:  We know that the total number of bottles is 76 (67 + 9). Now we need to find out how many bottles have more than one type of drink. So let's divide the total number of bottles by 2 since there are two types of drinks. Therefore, the number of bottles with Gewone Frisdrank is 76 / 2 = 38. Since there are only 9 bottles of Diet Frisdrank, the number of bottles with Gewone Frisdrank is greater than the number of bottles with Diet Frisdrank. So the answer is 38 - 9 = 29.
"Response:  We know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is 83 (22 + 61). Since there are more bottles of diet soda than regular soda, we can say that the number of bottles of diet soda is greater than the number of bottles of regular soda. So, let's call this difference x. Therefore, we have:

x = Number of bottles of diet soda - Number of bottles of regular soda
= 61 - 22
= 40
So, there were 40 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda in the supermarket."
Response:  The supermarket has 30 bottles of regular cola and 8 bottles of light cola. So far, we have 30 + 8 = 38 bottles of cola. Then, there are 41 apples. Since each apple takes up one space, we can subtract 41 from 38 to get the total number of spaces available for both cola and apples: 38 - 41 = -3. Therefore, the supermarket has -3 bottles of cola and -3 apples in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda and 53 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation:

Regular soda = 79
Diet soda = 53

Now, let's find out how many bottles of regular soda there are more than diet soda:

More regular soda = Regular soda - Diet soda
= 79 - 53
= 26

So, there are 26 bottles of regular soda more than diet soda in the supermarket."
Response:  We know that there are 83 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation: 83 - 54 = x, where x is the number of bottles of regular soda that they have more than diet soda. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 83: x / 83 = (54) / 83. Simplifying, we get x = 79. Therefore, they have 79 bottles of regular soda more than diet soda.
Response:  We know that out of total 17 bottles, 9 are regular soda and the remaining are diet soda. So, the number of diet soda bottles is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they have had 8 bottles of diet soda.
"Response:  We know that de supermarket had 19 bottles of diet soda and 60 bottles of regular soda. So, we can write this as an equation:

19 + 60 = x

Where ""x"" is the number of bottles of regular soda that the supermarket had more than diet soda. To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 19 from both sides of the equation:

60 - 19 = x

Now we have:

41 = x

So, the supermarket had 41 bottles of regular soda more than diet soda."
Response:  We know that the total number of flessen is 182 (72 + 32 + 78). Now we need to find out how many more flessen than apples they have. So, let's divide the total number of flessen by the number of apples: $182 / 78 = 2.35$ flessen more than apples. Therefore, the supermarket has $2.35$ flessen more than apples.
Response:  We know that the supermarket has 36 apples and 80 bottles of regular soda. To find out how many more bottles than apples they have, we can use the following equation: Number of bottles = Total number of bottles - Number of apples So, if we substitute the values given in the problem into this equation, we get: Number of bottles = 80 - 36 = 44 Therefore, the supermarket has 44 more bottles than apples.
Response:  We know that there were 30 bottles of soda in total, and 28 of them were regular soda. So, we can say that the number of Diet soda bottles is equal to 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, the supermarket had 2 bottles of Diet soda.
Response:  If the supermarket has 4 bottles of diet soda and they have more regular soda than diet soda, then we can assume that the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to the number of bottles of diet soda plus some unknown quantity x. Therefore, if the total number of bottles of both types of soda is y, then we can write the equation: 4 + x = y. Now, we are given that the total number of bottles of regular soda is 79, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 4 + x = 79. Solving for x, we get: x = 75. So, there are 75 bottles of regular soda in addition to the 4 bottles of diet soda.
Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of regular soda bottles plus the number of diet soda bottles plus the number of light soda bottles. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Bottles = Number of Regular Soda Bottles + Number of Diet Soda Bottles + Number of Light Soda Bottles. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Number of Bottles = 57 + 26 + 27 = 100 Therefore, there were 100 bottles of soda in total at the supermarket.
Response:  We know that there are 81 bottles of regular soda and 60 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as an equation: 81 + 60 = x, where x is the number of bottles of regular soda that they have more than diet soda. Now, we know that the total number of bottles of both types of soda is 141 (81 + 60). Therefore, we can set up another equation: 141 = x + 60, where x is the number of bottles of regular soda that they have more than diet soda. Solving for x, we get: x = 21. So, the supermarket has 21 bottles of regular soda that they have more than diet soda.
"Response:  We know that there were 49 bottles of regular soda and 6 bottles of diet soda. So, we can write this as follows:

Regular soda = 49
Diet soda = 6
Total number of bottles = Regular soda + Diet soda
= 49 + 6
= 55
Therefore, they had a total of 55 bottles of both regular and diet soda."
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 317 visitors that day, then we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 317 - 295 = 22

So, there were 22 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question than there were the day before."
"Response:  If there were 703 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 246 visitors on the day of Rachel's visit, then we can find out how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace in 25 days as follows:

Day 1: 703 visitors
Days 2-25: Average daily visitors = (Total number of visitors / Number of days) = (703 / 25) = 28.04 visitors per day
Therefore, in 25 days, approximately 28 x 25 = 700 visitors went to Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors to Buckingham Palace yesterday and then 666 visitors today, we can calculate the difference between these two numbers as follows:

Difference = 666 - 100 = 566

So, there were 566 more visitors to Buckingham Palace today than there were yesterday."
"Response:  If there were 132 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel arrived and 406 visitors in total over the past 327 days, then we can calculate the number of visitors per day as follows:

Number of visitors per day = Total number of visitors / Number of days
= 406 / 327
= 1.25

So, there were approximately 1.25 visitors to Buckingham Palace each day during the period under consideration."
Response:  We know that there were 45 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 829 visitors in the past 85 days. To find out how many visitors came on the specific day, we can use the following formula: Number of visitors on the day = Total number of visitors / Number of days since the last visit x Number of days until the next visit. In this case, we have: Number of visitors on the day = 829 / (85 - 1) x 1 = 829 / 84 x 1 = 1067 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel realized it.
"Response:  We know that there were 557 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day after Rachel discovered 71 paintings in the palace. So, if there were 188 visitors the previous day, we can calculate how many visitors went to Buckingham Palace in total over 57 days as follows:

Total visitors = Number of visitors yesterday x Number of days since yesterday
= 188 x (57 - 1)
= 9,460

Therefore, there were approximately 9,460 visitors to Buckingham Palace in 57 days."
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors to Buckingham Palace the day before and 39 paintings are displayed inside, then the total number of visitors per painting is:

$$ \text{Total visitors} = \frac{\text{Number of visitors days ago}}{\text{Number of paintings}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text{Total visitors} = \frac{600}{\times 39} = 15.47 $$

So, there were approximately 15.47 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day in question than there were the day before."
Response:  If there were 92 visitors to Buckingham Palace that day and 419 visitors the day before, then the total number of visitors for both days is: 92 + 419 = 511 visitors.
Response:  If there were 512 visitors to Buckingham Palace today and 471 visitors yesterday, then the total number of visitors over the past two days is: 512 + 471 = 983.  If there were also 808 visitors the day before that, then the total number of visitors over the past three days is: 983 + 808 = 1791.  Therefore, there have been 1791 visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days.
Response:  We know that there were 705 visitors to Buckingham Palace on the day of Rachel's visit and we also know that there were 191 visitors the previous day. So, if we subtract 191 from 705, we get 514. Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to Buckingham Palace on that day than during the preceding 245 days. To do this, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the day before (457) from the total number of visitors over those 245 days (514 - 457 = 57). Therefore, there were 57 more visitors to Buckingham Palace on that day than during the preceding 245 days.
"Response:  If he needs 159 grams of glue to attach the feathers together and each feather weighs 628 grams, then...

Solution: To find out how much glue he has already used, we can set up the following equation based on the information given in the problem:

Glue needed = Number of feathers x Weight of one feather
= 159 grams / 628 grams per feather
= 0.25 or 25%

So, he has already used 25% of the total amount of glue needed to attach the feathers together."
Response:  If he needs 49 grams of color to paint each feather and there are x feathers in total, then he needs 49x grams of color in total.  Since he now has 260 grams of color, that means he had x - 260 grams of color before. So, x = 260 / 49 = 5.3 feathers.
"Response:  We know that he needs 57 grams of color to paint the feathers and he has already used 22 grams of glue. So, he still needs 35 grams of color. Since he needs 353 grams of feathers in total, we can calculate how much he has left to paint as follows:

Total amount of feathers = 353 grams
Amount of feathers painted so far = 22 grams (glue) + 57 grams (color) = 89 grams
So, he has 264 grams of feathers left to paint."
Response:  If he had 166 grams of feathers and now has 20 grams, then he still needs 146 grams (166 - 20 = 146).
"Response:  If he had 557 grams at first and now needs only 17 grams more to be complete, then we can calculate how much he needed initially as follows:
Given that he needs 17 grams more, let x be the amount he originally had. Then, we know that his total weight = x + 17 grams.
So, we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 17 = 557
Solving for x, we get:
x = 540
Therefore, the man originally had 540 grams of feathers."
"Response:  If he currently has 11 grams and needs 492 grams in total, then we can calculate how much more he needs as follows:

Total amount needed = 492 grams
Current amount = 11 grams
Difference = Total amount - Current amount = 481 grams (or 481000 milligrams)
Therefore, he has 481 grams more than he needs."
Response:  We know that there are 94 drug pickers and they filled 90 vats of grapes in 6 days. So, we can calculate how many vats each picker filled per day as follows: Number of vats filled per picker = Total number of vats filled / Number of pickers = 90 / 94 = 0.95 vats per picker per day. Therefore, approximately 0.95 vats of grapes were filled per picker per day.
Response:  We know that there are 266 drug pluckers and they will fill 90 vats of grapes in 5 days. To find out how many vats would be filled each day, we can divide the total number of vats by the number of days available to fill them:  Number of vats filled/day = Total number of vats / Number of days = 90 vats / 5 days = 18 vats/day
Response:  We know that there are 294 pickers and they will fill 244 vats of grapes per day. Therefore, in one day, they will fill 244/294 = 0.83 vats of grapes. Since there are 146 days left before his last stop, we need to multiply the number of vats filled per day by 146 days: 0.83 x 146 = 115.68 vats of grapes. Similarly, we can calculate the number of vats of strawberries as follows: There are 47 pickers and they will fill 47 vats of strawberries per day. In how many days will they fill 47 vats of strawberries? 47/47 = 1 vat of strawberries per day. Now, let's find out how many vats of strawberries they will fill in total: 1 x 146 = 146 vats of strawberries. So, in summary, there would be 115.68 vats of grapes and 146 vats of strawberries.
"Response:  We know that there are 77 days until his last stop and he needs to fill 221 vats of grapes per day. So, we can calculate how many vats he will fill during those 77 days as follows:

Vats filled per day = Number of days x Amount of grapes needed per day
= 77 days x 221 vats
= 16,477 vats

So, in total, he would have filled 16,477 vats of grapes during his journey."
"Response:  If they filled 108 vats per day and there are 58 days left to fill the vats, then we can calculate how many vats will be filled as follows:

Vats filled = Total number of days / Number of vats filled per day
= 58 days / 108 vats/day
= 0.56 vats/day (or approximately 33 vats)

So, in total, 33 vats would be filled over 58 days."
Response:  If there are 36 drug pluckers and they can fill 8 vats of grapes per day, then in one day, they will be able to fill 8 x 36 = 288 vats of grapes.  To find out how many days it takes to fill 240 vats of grapes, we need to divide the total number of vats by the number of vats filled per day: 240 / 288 = 85 days. Therefore, it will take 85 days for the 36 drug pluckers to fill 240 vats of grapes.
Response:  We know that there are 52 total zoutwaterdieren and each aquarium has the same number of dieren. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of zoutwaterdieren per aquarium = Total number of zoutwaterdieren / Number of aquaria  Equation: Number of zoutwaterdieren per aquarium = 52 / x Where 'x' represents the number of aquaria. Now, we have to solve for 'x'. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 52: Number of zoutwaterdieren per aquarium = 52 / x ÷ 52 = x Now, we have found out that each aquarium contains 4 zoutwaterdieren (since 52 divided by 13 is equal to 4). So, the answer to the question is 4.
Response:  We know that he has 40 saltwater animals and each animal is kept in an aquarium with two other animals. So, we can write this as follows:  Aquariums = Number of Animals / Number per Aquarium  Aquariums = 40 / 2  Aquariums = 20   Therefore, he had 20 aquariums.
"Response:  We know that Tyler has 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium contains 39 animals, so we can write an equation as follows:

Saltwater animals = 56 x 39 = 2274
Freshwater animals = 10 x 39 = 390
Total number of animals = Saltwater animals + Freshwater animals
= 2274 + 390 = 2664
Therefore, Tyler has 2664 animals in total, including both saltwater and freshwater species."
Response:  We know that Tyler has 22 aquariums for saltwater animals and each aquarium contains 46 animals. Therefore, the total number of saltwater animals owned by Tyler is:  22 x 46 = 952. So, Tyler owns 952 saltwater animals.
Response:  For saltwater animals, he has 15 aquariums with 19 fish each = 285 fish. For freshwater animals, he has 62 aquariums with 19 fish each = 1238 fish. Therefore, in total, he has 285 + 1238 = 1523 fish.
Response:  If we buy 39 white T-shirts and they come in packages of 13 each, then... We can write this as an equation: 39 = 13x Where x is the number of packages. So, x = 39 / 13 = 3. Therefore, Mama has 3 packages of white T-shirts.
"Response:  If Mama buys 66 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then we can find out how many packages she has bought as follows:

Total number of T-shirts = Number of packages x Number of T-shirts per package
= 66 x 3
= 198

So, Mama has bought 198 packages of white T-shirts."
"Response:  If Mama buys 28 packages of white T-shirts that contain 56 T-shirts each, then...

Answer: 56

Explanation: Based on the information provided, each package contains 56 white T-shirts. Therefore, if Mama buys 28 packages, she will have a total of 56 x 28 = 1492 white T-shirts."
Response:  If Mama buys 57 packages of white T-shirts and each package contains 5 shirts, then she has bought a total of 57 x 5 = 285 white T-shirts.  Since she also bought 34 pairs of pants, that means she has 285 - 34 = 251 white T-shirts left. Therefore, Mama has 251 white T-shirts.
"Response:  If mama bought 51 white T-shirts and they can be purchased in packages of three, then...

Answer: 51 / 3 = 17 packages

Therefore, Mama has 17 packages of white T-shirts."
Response:  If Mama bought 70 white T-shirts in total and each package contains x white T-shirts, then we can write an equation as follows:  Number of packages = Total number of T-shirts / Number of T-shirts per package  In this case, we know that Mama bought 14 packages, so we can substitute this value into our equation:  Number of packages = 70 / x  Now we need to solve for x (the number of T-shirts per package). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the number of packages:  x = 70 / 14  So there are 5 white T-shirts in each package (x = 5).
Response:  We have 4 bags with an equal number of cookies and total amount of cookies is 36. So, if we divide 36 cookies equally among 4 bags, each bag will contain how many cookies?  To find out, let's use division.  Division helps us share things equally. In this case, we need to divide 36 cookies by 4 bags.  So, the answer is 9 cookies per bag (or 36 / 4 = 9).
"Response:  If you have 33 cookies and each bag has 11 cookies, then...

Answer: You will have 3 bags of cookies."
Response:  If each bag has 41 cookies and you have 53 bags of cookies... then how many cookies do you have in total?  We can calculate this by multiplying the number of cookies per bag with the number of bags you have:  Number of cookies = Total number of bags x Number of cookies per bag  In this case, we know that there are 41 cookies in each bag, so if you have 53 bags, then the total number of cookies is: Number of cookies = 53 x 41 = 2193 cookies. Therefore, you have 2193 cookies in total.
Response:  If we have 14 cookies and we divide them equally among 7 bags, each bag will contain how many cookies?  To find out, let's use division. We can write it as follows: 14 / 7 = x, where x is the number of cookies in each bag. So, there are 2 cookies in each bag (x = 2).
"Response:  If each bag has 3 cookies and you have 21 total cookies, then...

Answer: You will have 7 bags of cookies (21 / 3 = 7)."
Response:  We have 26 bags with an equal number of cookies in each bag (26 x 26 = 676). If we add 15 pieces of candy and 52 cookies to that amount, we get 676 + 15 = 691 and 691 / 26 = 26 bags of cookies. So, you have 26 bags of cookies.
Response:  We know that we started with 14 bags of cookies and each bag contains an equal number of cookies. So if we have 28 cookies in total, then each bag must contain 28/14 = 2 cookies. Similarly, if we have 86 pieces of candy in total, then each bag must contain 86/14 = 6 pieces of candy. Therefore, you have 14 bags of cookies, each containing 2 cookies, so you have a total of 28 cookies.
Response:  If the mailman has to deliver five pieces of junk to each block and he gives 25 pieces of mail to each house in a block, then there are 25/5 = 5 houses per block. Therefore, there are 5 blocks in total.
"Response:  Since there are 20 houses in each block and the postman has to give nine pieces of mail to each house, the total number of pieces of mail he needs to deliver is:

9 x 20 = 180 pieces of mail

So, the postman needs to deliver 180 pieces of mail to each block."
Response:  There are six houses in each block and the mailman has to give 24 pieces of mail to each block. So, we need to divide 24 by 6 to find out how many pieces of mail he needs to deliver to each house. Therefore, the answer is 4 (24/6).
"Response:  If there are 14 emails per house and the mailman has to give two pieces of junk mail to each house, then the total number of houses is:

14 x 2 = 28

So, there are 28 houses in one block."
Response:  There are 20 houses in each block, so there are 20 x 20 = 400 houses in total. Since the mailman has to deliver 32 pieces of mail to each house, he will have to deliver a total of 32 x 400 = 12800 pieces of mail. Therefore, the answer is 12800.
Response:  We have to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail (30) by the number of houses per block (19). So we get: 30 / 19 = 1.6. Therefore, each house will receive approximately 1.6 pieces of junk mail.
Response:  The postman has to deliver 8 pieces of mail to each of the 55 blocks. If he gives 32 pieces of mail to each block, then we can deduce that there are 55 x 32 = 1700 houses in all the blocks combined. Therefore, there are 1700 / 55 = 31 houses per block.
Response:  Since there are 81 blocks and each block has 12 houses, the total number of houses is 81 x 12 = 972. So, the postman needs to deliver four pieces of mail to each house, which means he needs to give out a total of 4 x 972 = 3888 pieces of mail.
Response:  Since there are 16 blocks and each block has 17 houses, the total number of houses is 16 x 17 = 252.  As the postman needs to give four pieces of mail to each house, he will need to give 252 x 4 = 1008 pieces of mail in total.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 pebbles. If we want to group them into groups of four, how many groups can be created? To do this, we need to divide both numbers by 4. So, 10 / 4 = 2 and 20 / 4 = 5. Therefore, there will be 2 x 5 = 10 groups.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 10 knickers and 15 eggs. If she wants to divide them into groups of 5, how many groups can she make?  To do this, we need to divide 10 (the number of knickers) by 5 (the number of knickers per group): 10 / 5 = 2. So, Rebecca can create 2 groups of knickers. Now let's check if there is enough space for all the eggs. How many eggs will fit in each group of knickers? To find out, we need to divide 15 (the number of eggs) by 5 (the number of eggs per group): 15 / 5 = 3. So, three eggs will fit in each group of knickers. Therefore, Rebecca can create 2 groups of knickers, which means she can create 4 groups of eggs (since 4 x 3 = 12). Thus, the answer is 4.
"Response:  If Rebecca has a total of eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 11 eggs each, then the number of groups is equal to the total number of eggs divided by 11. So we can write this equation:

Total number of eggs = Number of groups x Number of eggs per group

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of eggs = 120 x 2

Therefore, Rebecca has 240 eggs."
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 snails. She wants to divide them into four groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have. To do this, we can use division. For example, if she divides 8 eggs equally among 4 groups, then each group will have 2 eggs. Similarly, if she divides 6 snails equally among 4 groups, then each group will have 1.5 snails (since there are more eggs than snails). Therefore, the number of eggs each group will have is 2, and the number of snails each group will have is 1.5.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 4 knickers and 15 eggs. She wants to divide them into three groups. So we need to find out how many eggs each group will have.  Group 1: 4 knickers / 3 groups = 1 knicker per group (we already used one) + 15 eggs / 3 groups = 5 eggs per group. Therefore, Group 1 will have 5 eggs.  Group 2: 4 knickers / 3 groups = 1 knicker per group (we already used one) + 15 eggs / 3 groups = 5 eggs per group. Therefore, Group 2 will also have 5 eggs.  Group 3: 4 knickers / 3 groups = 1 knicker per group (we already used one) + 15 eggs / 3 groups = 5 eggs per group. Therefore, Group 3 will also have 5 eggs.  So all three groups will have 5 eggs each.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 18 eggs and she wants to divide them into groups of 6 eggs each. So, we need to find out how many times 18 can be divided by 6.  Well, 18 / 6 = 3. Therefore, Rebecca will create 3 groups of eggs. Now let's see what happens with the other items. We have 72 bananas and 66 knick-knacks. If we want to distribute these equally among the 3 egg groups, then we need to calculate how many bananas and knick-knacks each group will get.  For example, if we take the first group of eggs (which has 6 eggs), then it will also get 6 bananas and 6 knick-knacks. Similarly, for the second and third groups, we will give them 6 bananas and 6 knick-knacks as well.  So, finally, Rebecca will create 3 groups of eggs, and each group will receive an equal number of bananas and knick-knacks.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. If we divide these equally among three groups of eggs each, then each group will contain 33 eggs (9 / 3 = 33). So there will be 33 groups of eggs. Now let's count how many knick-knacks are left over after dividing the eggs into groups. There are 27 knick-knacks remaining, which means that one group of eggs contains 5 knick-knacks (27 / 3 = 5). Therefore, there will be 33 groups of eggs with 5 knick-knacks in each group.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 knickers. If she divides them into groups of 5, then we can calculate how many groups she will have.  So, let's divide 20 by 5: 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, Rebecca will have 4 groups of eggs. Now, let's count the number of knickers: 6. Since there are only 6 knickers, they will not be divided into any group. So, Rebecca has more eggs than knickers. The difference between the number of eggs and knickers is 4 - 1 = 3. Therefore, Rebecca has 3 more eggs than knickers.
Response:  We know that Rebecca has five knickers and twelve eggs. If we divide the number of eggs by two (since each group contains 20 eggs), then we get: 12 / 2 = 6 groups of eggs. Therefore, Rebecca has six more eggs than knickers. So, the answer is: 6.
Response:  If Luke scored 154 points and won 11 points per round, then he must have played x number of rounds. We can write this as an equation: 154 = x \* 11. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 13 (rounds). So, Luke played 13 rounds in the trivia game.
"Response:  If Luke has played 177 rounds of a trivia game and won 46 points in each round, then he has scored a total of:

$$ \text {Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$

where $x_i$ is the number of points Luke earned in the $i^{th}$ round, which we are given as 46.

So, substituting this value into the equation above, we get:

$$ \text{Total score} = \sum_{i=1}^{177} 46 $$

Simplifying the sum, we get:

$$ \boxed{\text{Total score}} = 8238 $$

Therefore, Luke has scored 8238 points in the trivia game."
Response:  If Luke scored 84 points in total and he scored the same number of points each round, then the number of points he scored per round is equal to his total score divided by the number of rounds he played. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Points per round = Total score / Number of rounds  In this case, the total score is 84 points, and the number of rounds is 2 rounds. Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the points per round:  Points per round = 84 / 2 = 42 points per round  So, Luke scored 42 points per round.
Response:  If Luke won 146 points in each round of the game and he played 157 rounds, then he scored a total of 146 x 157 = 22,322 points in the game.
"Response:  If Luke scored 78 points after playing several rounds of the trivia game and received 3 points for each round he played, we can calculate how many rounds he played as follows:

Total points = Number of rounds x Points per round
= 78 x 3
= 234

So, Luke played 234 rounds of the trivia game."
Response:  We know that Emily made 32 necklaces and she had two clasps. So we can write an equation as follows: Number of clasps = Total number of necklaces / Number of necklaces per clasp. In this case, the total number of necklaces is 32, and the number of necklaces per clasp is 2 (since Emily had two clasps). Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation to get: Number of clasps = 32 / 2 = 16. So, Emily needed 16 clasps to make all 32 necklaces.
Response:  If Emily made 11 halskettingen and each halsketting has 28 kralen, then we can calculate how many kralen Emily made as follows:  Number of kralen = Total number of kralen / Number of halskettingen  In this case, the total number of kralen is 28 x 11 = 308 kralen. So, Emily made 308 kralen in total.
Response:  If Emily makes one ketting with 8 kralen, she can make 8 kettingen in total.  And if she has 16 kralen, she can make 16 x 8 = 128 kettingen in total. So, Emily can make 128 halskettingen.
Response:  We know that Emily made 18 necklaces and she had 6 beads. To make each necklace, she needed 3 beads. So, we can conclude that each necklace required 3 beads. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  If Emily made four halskettingen and each halsketting needs five kralen, then she needed a total of twenty kralen to make all four halskettingen. So, the answer is twenty.
Response:  If Emily has 6 kralen and each ketting has 3 kralen, then she can make 6 x 3 = 18 halskettingen in total.
Response:  We know that Emily made 20 necklaces and she had 5 beads left after making all those necklaces. So, each necklace required 5 - 20 = -15 beads. Since there are 43 friends, we need to divide -15 by 43, which gives us approximately -0.35 beads per friend. Therefore, each friend needed approximately 0.35 beads for one necklace.
Response:  If Emily made 26 halskettingen and each halsketting has 2 kralen, then she made in total 26 x 2 = 52 kralen. Therefore, Emily had 52 kralen.
Response:  We know that there are 819058 children from Lawrence County and they all go to camp during summer vacation. So, we have 819058 x 1 = 819058 children who spent their summer vacation at the camp. Now, let's find out how many children stayed home. According to the question, 668278 children did not go to camp. Therefore, we subtract this number from the total number of children to get the number of children who stayed home: 819058 - 668278 = 150837 children. So, 150837 children stayed home instead of going to camp.
"Response:  We know that there are 100000 children who go to camp and 777622 children who stay at home. So we can write this as a proportion: 

Number of children who went to camp = 100000
Number of children who stayed at home = 777622

Now we want to find out how many times bigger the number of children who stayed at home is compared to those who went to camp. To do this, we divide the number of children who stayed at home by the number of children who went to camp: 

Size of the group who stayed at home relative to the group who went to camp = Number of children who stayed at home / Number of children who went to camp
= 777622 / 100000
= 7.77
So the size of the group who stayed at home relative to the group who went to camp is 7.77 times bigger."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total in Lawrence County. If 629424 go to camp and the remaining stay at home, then we can calculate it as follows: Number of children who will be at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp So, the number of children who will be at home is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627 children. Therefore, 268627 children will remain at home during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that there are 313.473 children in total and during summer vacation, 274.865 stay at home while the remaining go to camp. So, we need to find out how many go to camp. To do this, we can use division. The number of children who go to camp is equal to the total number of children minus the number of children who stay at home. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of children going to camp = Total number of children - Number of children staying at home  Number of children going to camp = 313.473 - 274.865  Number of children going to camp = 38.608  There are 38,608 children who go to camp during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that 907611 children will stay at home during summer vacation and 455682 children will go to camp. So, we need to find out how many children there are in total in Lawrence County. To do this, we can multiply the number of children who will stay at home with the number of children who will go to camp:  Number of children in Lawrence County = (Number of children who will stay at home x Number of children who will go to camp)  In this case, we have: Number of children in Lawrence County = (907611 x 455682) = 39357322  Therefore, there are 39357322 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 800059 children from Lawrence County go to camp and the remaining stay at home. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Number of children who went to camp = 828521 - 800059 = 284662. So, there are 284662 children who stayed at home during the summer vacation in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that during summer vacation, 61619 children stayed at home and the remaining went to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of children who went to camp = Total number of children - Number of children who stayed at home. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of children who went to camp = 91676 - 61619 = 30057. Therefore, 30057 children from Lawrence County went to camp during the summer vacation.
Response:  We know that 34,044 children from Lawrence County went to camp and 13,486 stayed home. So, the total number of children from Lawrence County is 34,044 + 13,486 = 47,530. Now we need to add the number of children who lived outside the province, which is 424,944. Therefore, the total number of children at the camp is 47,530 + 424,944 = 472,474.
Response:  We know that 610769 children from Lawrence County go to camp and 590796 children stay at home. So, the total number of children in Lawrence County is: 610769 + 590796 = 1201565.  Therefore, there are 1201565 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that there are 644997 children who stayed at home during summer vacation and 893835 children went to camp. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Number of children staying at home = Total number of children - Number of children going to camp  Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:  Number of children staying at home = 644997 + 893835 - 78  Number of children staying at home = 721008  Therefore, there are 721008 children in Lawrence County.
Response:  We know that Adam has three more apples than Jackie and he has nine in total. So if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x +3 = 9 apples. Therefore, Jackie has 9 - (x+3) = 6 apples.
Response:  Adam has ten apples and Jackie has two apples. To find out how many more apples Adam has than Jackie, we can subtract the number of apples that Jackie has from the number of apples that Adam has. So, the answer is:  Ten - Two = Eight. Therefore, Adam has eight more apples than Jackie.
Response:  We know that Adam has nine apples and Jackie has ten apples. So, we can say that Jackie has one more apple than Adam (ten - nine = one). Therefore, Jackie has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  We know that Jackie has ten apples and Adam has eight apples. To find out how many more apples Jackie has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jackie has:  10 - 8 = 2 So, Jackie has two more apples than Adam.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have six apples. If Jackie has four more apples than Adam and Jackie together, then Jackie must have ______ apples.  So, the answer is 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie have together seven apples. If we subtract this number from nine, we get two. Therefore, he has two apples.
Response:  We know that Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples. If Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, then Jackie has 4 apples (12 - 8 = 4). So, Adam has 5 apples (8 + 5 = 13).
Response:  We know that Adam has four more apples than Jackie and together they have two apples. So, if Jackie has ten apples, then Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples.
Response:  We know that Adam has more apples than Jackie. So, if Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 5 apples. Since Jackie has 89 pears and 11 apples, we can write an equation: x + (x + 5) = 89. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 5 = 89. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us: 2x = 84. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 42. Therefore, Adam has 42 apples.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 31 cookies yesterday and 270 cookies today. So, in total she has baked 301 cookies until yesterday (including both days).  Therefore, the correct answer is: 301.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 90 chocolate cookies yesterday and today she has baked 51 more roses cookies. So in total, Helen has baked 90 + 51 = 141 chocolate cookies.  Therefore, the answer is 141 chocolate cookies have been baked by Helen.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 527 chocolate cookies and 86 raisin cookies. So far so good! Now we are told that she has also baked 86 raisin cookies and 554 chocolate cookies. That means she has baked a total of 527 + 86 = 613 cookies in all. Therefore, Helen has baked 613 chocolate cookies. 
Response:  We know that Helen has baked a total of 144 + 397 = 541 koekjes. Since we are asked how many rozijnkoekjes Helen has baked, we can subtract the number of chocoladekoekjes from the total number of koekjes to get the number of rozijnkoekjes. So, the answer is:  Number of rozijnkoekjes = Total number of koekjes - Number of chocoladekoekjes = 541 - 144 = 401 rozijnkoekjes. Therefore, Helen has baked 401 rozijnkoekjes.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 19 chocolate cookies yesterday and today she has baked 237 more chocolate cookies. So in total, Helen has baked 256 chocolate cookies (19 + 237).  Therefore, the answer is 256.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 197 chocolate cookies yesterday and she also made 46 cranberry cookies yesterday. So, altogether she had baked 243 cookies (197 + 46) yesterday. Now we are told that she baked 75 chocolate cookies and 66 cranberry cookies today. Therefore, the total number of chocolate cookies that Helen has baked is 75 + 66 = 141. So, Helen had baked 141 chocolate cookies yesterday.
Response:  We know that Helen has baked 280 rozijnkoekjes and 359 chocoladekoekjes. So, we can write this as an equation: 280 + 359 = 519.  Now, let's solve for the number of rozijnkoekjes:  Subtracting 359 from both sides gives us: 280 - 359 = x.  Solving for x, we get: x = 171. Therefore, Helen has baked 171 rozijnkoekjes.
"Response:  We know that Katie has 81 DS games and her friends have 59 games. To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:

81 - 59 = 22

So, Katie has 22 more DS games than her friends."
Response:  We know that Katie has 91 DS games and her new friends have 88 games. So together they have 91 + 88 = 179 games. Now we are asked how many games her old friends have. According to the question, her old friends have 53 games. Therefore, the total number of games that all three groups of friends have is 179 (Katie and new friends) + 53 (old friends) = 232 games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 78 new games and her friends have 48 new games. So together they have 78 + 48 = 126 new games.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Katie has 84 new and 19 old games in total. So, her total number of games is 84 + 19 = 103. Now, let's find out how many new games she has. According to the question, Katie's friends have 8 new games. Since they are friends with Katie, their combined number of new games must be equal to Katie's number of new games plus their own number of new games. Therefore, the total number of new games that Katie and her friends together have can be calculated as follows: New games of Katie + New games of friends = 103 (Katie) + 8 = 111. So, the answer to the question is 111.
Response:  We know that Katie has 80 old games and her friends have 41 old games. So together they have 80 + 41 = 121 old games.
Response:  We know that Katie has 63 DS games and her friends have 57 games. So we can say that Katie has more than 57 - 63 = -6 games less than her friends. Therefore, Katie has 63 - 6 = 57 games more than her friends.
Response:  We know that Katie has 57 new and 39 old games in total. Her friends have 34 new games. So, we need to find out how many games Katie has more than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of new games her friends have from the number of new games Katie has:  Number of new games Katie has - Number of new games her friends have = 57 - 34 = 23. Therefore, Katie has 23 more games than her friends.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has $19 at first and after washing cars he got $33. So, his total amount of money earned from washing cars is $33 - $19 = $14. Therefore, Jason earned $14 with washing cars.
Response:  Firstly, Fred has $86 and he has washed cars, so now he has $9. So, his new amount is $86 - $9 = $77. Now, let's consider Jason. He had $5 and didn't work, so he still has $5. Therefore, their total amount of money together is $77 + $5 = $82.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $19 last week and now he has $40 this week. So, his increase in money is $21 ($40 - $19). Similarly, Jason had $16 last week and now he has $69 this week. His increase in money is $53 ($69 - $16). Now, to find out how much Fred earned this weekend, we need to subtract his increase from Jason's total amount of money. Therefore, Fred earned $53 ($69 - $21) this weekend.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $21 and Jason has $78 after washing cars. So, to find out how much Jason earned this weekend, we need to subtract what Fred made from the total amount of money they both had initially. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:
Jason's earnings = Total initial amount - Fred's earnings
= $114 - $21
= $93
Therefore, Jason earned $93 this weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $111 last week and he spent some of it on washing cars. So, his new amount is less than $111. Then, we meet Jason who had $40 last week and now has $44 after delivering newspapers. Now let's calculate how much money they earned from washing cars:  We can see that Fred went from having $111 to having $115, which means he earned $4 ($115 - $111) from washing cars. Similarly, since Jason started with $40 and now has $44, he also earned $4 ($44 - $40). Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from washing cars is $8 ($4 + $4).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred has $49 and he spent some money on washing cars, so now he has $112. Similarly, Jason started with $3 and earned some money from delivering newspapers, so now he has $63. So, the total amount of money they both have after doing their respective jobs is : $112 + $63 = $175. Therefore, they together earned $175 by delivering newspapers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jason has $31 and he spends $14 to buy newspapers, so now he has $17 left ($31 - $14 = $17).  Next, we know that Fred has $78 and he spent $25 to wash cars, so now he has $53 left ($78 - $25 = $53).  Therefore, the total amount of money they earned from delivering newspapers is $17 + $53 = $70.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred made $33 last week and Jason made $95 last week. So together they earned $128 ($33 + $95). Now let's see what happened over the weekend: Fred delivered newspapers for $16 and washed cars for $74. So his total earnings this weekend are $90 ($16 + $74). Therefore, Fred earned $32 more than he did last week ($128 - $90 = $32).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fred had $47 last week and then he made money from delivering newspapers for $111. So his new total amount of money is: $47 + $111 = $158. Then, we are told that Fred also spent $34 on washing cars. So, his new total amount of money after paying for car wash is: $158 - $34 = $124. Therefore, Fred now has $124.
Response:  Jessie started at 71 kg and lost 20 kg through running. So her current weight is 71 - 20 = 51 kg. Therefore, she now weighs 51 kg.
Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 27 kg. After she started jogging, she lost 101 kg. So, if we subtract the weight she lost from her current weight, we get: 27 - 101 = -74 kg. Therefore, Jessie weighed -74 kg before she started jogging.
Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 126 kg. After starting to jog, she lost weight and now weighs 66 kg. So, her original weight before starting to jog was 126 - 66 = 60 kg.
"Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 69 kg. Since she lost 35 kg while jogging, her current weight is:

69 kg - 35 kg = 34 kg

So, Jessie now weighs 34 kg."
Response:  In the first week, Jessie lost 50 kg, so her weight at the end of the first week is: $W_1 = W_0 - 50$.  Where $W_0$ is her initial weight which is given as 114 kg. So, $W_1 = 114 - 50 = 64$ kg.  Now, in the second week, she lost another 60 kg, so her weight at the end of the second week is: $W_2 = W_1 - 60 = 64 - 60 = 4$ kg$. Therefore, Jessie now weighs 4 kg.
Response:  Before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 9 kg. In the first week of jogging, she lost 62 kg, which means her new weight is: 9 kg + (62 kg / 7 days) = 9 kg + 9 kg/7 = 18 kg.  In the second week, she lost another 140 kg, so her new weight is: 18 kg + (140 kg / 7 days) = 18 kg + 20 kg/7 = 38 kg. Therefore, before she started jogging, Jessie weighed 38 kg.
Response:  In the first week of jogging, Jessie lost 56 kg. So her weight after one week is: $W_1 = W_0 - 56$ where $W_0$ is her initial weight (which is 92 kg). Now let's assume she lost another 43 kg in the second week. Therefore, her weight after two weeks is: $$W_2 = W_1 - 43 \Rightarrow W_2 = 92 - 43 = 50$$ kg. So, Jessie's weight after the first week of jogging is 50 kg and after the second week it is 50 - 43 = 7 kg.
Response:  We know that there were 95 snakes in total and 61 alligators. If 64 of them were hidden, then we can conclude that the number of visible snakes is equal to the number of non-hidden snakes minus the number of hidden snakes. So, the number of visible snakes is: 95 - (64) = 31. Therefore, there were 31 visible snakes in the zoo.
Response:  We know that there were 97 alligators in total and 40 of them were hidden. So, if we subtract the number of hidden alligators (40) from the total number of alligators (97), we get:  97 - 40 = 57 Alligators are not hidden.
Response:  We know that there were initially three snakes and 75 alligators in the cage. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators hid themselves, then we have to subtract these numbers from the initial total number of snakes and alligators. So, the number of alligators not hidden is: 75 - 19 = 56 alligators. Therefore, there were 56 alligators not hidden in the cage.
Response:  We know that there are 79 animals in total in the cage. If we subtract the number of snakes (24) and crocodiles (51), we get:  79 - 24 = 55  So, there were 55 animals hidden in the cage other than snakes and crocodiles.
Response:  Yesterday he had 134 tomatoes and today he has 30 more (30 + 134 = 164). So, after plucking tomatoes yesterday and today, he will have 164 - 171 = -7 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday he picked 56 tomatoes, so he had 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in his garden. Today he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now he has 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in his garden.
Response:  Yesterday he plucked 154 tomatoes and today he plucked 50. So, total number of tomatoes plucked = yesterday + today = 154 + 50 = 204. Therefore, he has plucked 204 tomatoes.
Response:  The farmer initially had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes. If he picks 172 potatoes, then he has 13 (175 - 172) tomatoes left. So, the farmer now has 13 tomatoes and 77 potatoes.
Response:  The farmer initially has 177 tomatoes and 12 aardappels (Dutch for potatoes) in his garden. If he picks 53 tomatoes, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he has 12 aardappels initially, and he picks none, then he still has 12 aardappels. So, the final number of tomatoes is 124, and the final number of aardappels is 12.
Response:  The farmer started with 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes, so together he had 176 tomatoes (105 + 71). If he then picked 137 tomatoes, we can subtract this amount from the total number of tomatoes to find out how many are left: 176 - 137 = 39. So there are still 39 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden after he picks 137 tomatoes.
Response:  We know that John used 4 spikes for the entire wall. Since each plank needs 2 spikes to be fixed, we can calculate the number of planks needed as follows: Number of planks = Total number of spikes / Number of spikes per plank Therefore, the number of planks needed for the wall is: Number of planks = 4 / 2 = 2 planks So, John needs 2 planks for the wall.
Response:  We know that for the walls of the house, John used 13 large wooden planks. Each plank requires 17 screws to be fixed, so we need to calculate how many screws are needed in total. The number of small planks is not given, but since there are 8 small planks per large plank, we can assume that there are 13 x 8 = 104 small planks in total. Therefore, the total number of screws required for all the planks is: 13 x 17 + 104 x 8 = 2596 screws.
Response:  We know that John used 11 spikes for the entire wall and each plank requires 3 spikes to be fixed. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: Number of planks = Total number of spikes / Number of spikes per plank So, if we substitute the values given in the problem, we get: Number of planks = 11 / 3 = 3 The question asks how many planks John needs for the wall, so we multiply the number of planks by the total number of spikes he used: Number of planks x Total number of spikes = 3 x 11 = 33 Therefore, John needs 33 planks for the wall.
Response:  For the large planks, he needs 15 spikes to secure them (since they require 15 small planks). And for the small planks, he needs 5 spikes to secure them (since they require 5 small planks). Therefore, John needs a total of 15 + 5 = 20 spikes to secure all the planks for the wall.
Response:  We know that John needs two spikes for each plank to fix it to the wall. Since he will use 16 planks in total, he will need 2 x 16 = 32 spikes altogether. Therefore, John needs 32 spikes for the wall.
Response:  We know that for each wall of the house, John needs to use eight large wooden planks. Since each plank requires 74 screws to be fixed, we can calculate how many screws are needed in total as follows: Number of planks = Total number of screws / Number of screws per plank = 8 x 74 = 592 screws. Therefore, John needs 592 planks to build the walls of the house.
"Response:  We know that for the walls of the house, John used 12 large planks and 17 small planks.  To attach each large plank to the wall, it needs 14 spikes. Therefore, the total number of spikes needed for all large planks is:

12 large planks x 14 spikes per plank = 168 spikes

Similarly, we know that each small plank requires 25 spikes to be attached to the wall. So, the total number of spikes needed for all small planks is:

17 small planks x 25 spikes per plank = 425 spikes

Now, let's add up the total number of spikes required for both large and small planks:

168 + 425 = 593 spikes

Therefore, John needs 593 planks (large or small) to build the walls of the house."
Response:  We know that there are 3 pieces of gum in each package and a total of 42 pieces of gum. So if we divide 42 by 3, we get 14 packages of gum. Therefore, Robin has 14 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 43 packages of gum and each package contains 23 pieces of gum. So, the total number of pieces of gum is: 43 x 23 = 1005 pieces of gum. Now we are told that Robin has 8 additional pieces of gum. Therefore, the final answer is: 1005 + 8 = 1013 pieces of gum.
Response:  We know that there are seven pieces of gum in each package and Robin has six additional pieces of gum. So, we can write this as follows: 7 x (number of packages) = total number of pieces of gum.  Since Robin has 41 pieces of gum, we can set up an equation: 7x = 41.  Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, Robin has 6 packages of gum.
Response:  We know that Robin has 28 packets of gum and 13 packets of candy. Since each packet contains four pieces of candy or gum, we can calculate as follows: Total number of pieces = Number of packets x Number of pieces per packet Total number of pieces = 28 x 4 + 13 x 4 Total number of pieces = 112 + 52 = 164 pieces of gum and candy. Therefore, Robin has 164 pieces of gum and candy.
Response:  We know that Robin has 21 packages of gum and each package contains 9 pieces of gum. So, he has a total of 21 x 9 = 189 pieces of gum. Now we are asked how many bags of candy Robin has. Each bag of candy contains 45 pieces of candy. Therefore, Robin has 45 x 1 = 45 bags of candy.
Response:  Pakjes kauwgom = 28 x 6 = 168 stukjes Kauwgum Pakjes snoep = 14 x 6 = 84 stukjes Snoep Total number of pieces = 168 + 84 = 252 stukjes Therefore, Robin has 252 pieces in total.
Response:  We know that the industrial machine can make 3 shirts per minute and it made 6 shirts in total. So we need to find out how many minutes it took for the machine to make those 6 shirts. To do this, we divide the number of shirts by the number of shirts per minute: 6 shirts / 3 shirts/minute = 2 minutes. Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 2 minutes to make all 6 shirts.
Response:  The industrial machine worked for 5 minutes. In one minute, it can make 4 shirts. So in 5 minutes, it can make 4 x 5 = 20 shirts. Therefore, the machine has made 20 shirts.
Response:  Gisteren (yesterday) made 9 shirts in x minutes = 9/x. Vandaag (today) made 44 shirts in y minutes = 44/y. We know that x > y because yesterday produced more than today. So we can write: 9/x > 44/y. Now we need to find the value of x and y. To do this, we divide both sides of the inequality by 9/x: 9/x > 44/y = 10.5. Therefore, the machine worked for 10.5 minutes yesterday.
Response:  The industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today. So, altogether it has worked for x minutes = (13 + 3) minutes = 16 minutes. Since the machine can make 8 shirts per minute, it has worked for x minutes / 8 = 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time the machine has worked is 20 minutes.
Response:  The industrial machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 today. So, it has produced a total of 17 shirts in two days (9 + 8). Since the machine can produce two shirts per minute, it worked for 17/2 = 8 minutes today. Therefore, the industrial machine worked for 8 minutes today.
Response:  Gisteren (yesterday) the machine made 4 shirts in 1 minute = 4 shirts/minute. Vandaag (today) the machine made 8 shirts in 2 minutes = 8 shirts / 2 minutes = 4 shirts/minute. In total, the machine worked for 1 + 2 = 3 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 3 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine made 6 x 12 = 72 shirts in total. Today, it made 6 x 14 = 84 shirts in total. So, the total number of shirts the machine has made is 72 + 84 = 156 shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 5 minutes and made 6 shirts/minute x 5 minutes = 30 shirts yesterday. Today, the machine worked for 12 minutes and made 6 shirts/minute x 12 minutes = 72 shirts today. Therefore, the total number of shirts made by the machine is 30 + 72 = 102 shirts.
Response:  If they earned $165 in 5 days, that means they earned $33 per day.
Response:  The Carnival lasted for 22 days and each day they threw rings that earned them $144 dollars. So, in total, they earned $3088 ($144 x 22).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that they earned $420 from selling rings during Carnival and $22 from playing the ring toss game. So far so good! Now let's calculate how much money they made each day:

$420 / 30 days = $14 per day (from selling rings)
$22 / 30 days = $0.77 per day (from playing the ring toss game)
So, if you ask me directly, I would say that Ring Toss brought in around $0.77 per day. However, since there are 30 days in total, the daily income from Ring Toss is actually $2.21 ($0.77 x 30 days)."
Response:  In the first 44 days, they earned $382. In the remaining 10 days, they earned $374. So, their total earnings are: $382 + $374 = $756.
Response:  The total amount of money earned during the first 20 days was $120, and the remaining 16 days brought in $66, for a total of $186. So, to find out how much they earned per day during the first 20 days, we can divide the total amount by the number of days: $186 / 20 = $9.3 dollars per day.
"Response:  The first part of the question states that they earned $325 during the first 154 days and $114 during the remaining 57 days. To find out how much they earned per day during the last 57 days, we can divide the total amount earned ($114) by the number of days left (57):

$114 / 57 = $2

So, they earned $2 per day during the last 57 days of the carnival."
Response:  If Lucy went to the store and bought 10 packages of cookies, that means she bought 10 x 6 = 60 cookies in total. Then, if she also bought 4 packages of cake, that means she bought 4 x 8 = 32 pieces of cake in total. So, in total, Lucy bought 60 + 32 = 92 cookies and cakes. Therefore, she still has 92 - 60 = 32 cookies left after buying those items at the market.
Response:  Pakjes koekjes = 4 x 20 = 80 Pakjes cake = 22 x 1 = 22 Pakjes chocolade = 16 x 1 = 16 Total number of packages = 80 + 22 + 16 = 128
Response:  We know that Lucy went to the store and bought 23 bags of cookies and some bags of cake. So far, she has made 23 + x = 27 purchases. Since we are told that she did not buy any tarts, the value of x is zero. Therefore, Lucy did not buy any tarts.
"Response:  We know that Lucy went to the store and bought 2 packages of cookies (which cost $4 each) and 12 packages of cake ($3 each). Therefore, she spent a total of:

$4 x 2 = $8 for cookies
$3 x 12 = $36 for cake
Total amount spent = $8 + $36 = $44
So, Lucy spent a total of $44 at the store."
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. So, now we have 12 + 4 = 16 people in the bus. Since each bus can carry no more than 36 passengers, we know that the number of people in the bus is less than or equal to 36. Therefore, the final answer is 16 ÷ 36 = 0.44 (or 44%) of the maximum capacity of the bus.
Response:  At first, there were eight people in the bus. Then, twelve more people got on and three people got off. So, now there are... (8 + 12 - 3) = 27 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 13 more people got off at the stop. So, now there are 4 + 13 = 17 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people in the train and then 8 more got off at the station. So, now there are 11 - 8 = 3 people left in the train. Therefore, there are 3 people sitting in the train right now.
Response:  We know that there were 22 parents in the program and 676 people in total. To find out how many students were present, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people. So, 676 - 22 = 654. Therefore, there were 654 students present.
Response:  We know that there were 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in the program. To find out how many people were involved in the program overall, we need to add up these numbers. So, the total number of people involved is: 73 + 724 + 744 = 1531. Therefore, there were 1531 people involved in the program.
"Response:  We know that there were 174 parents and 521 students. To find out how many more students than parents, we need to subtract the number of parents from the total number of people (students + parents). So, let's do this calculation:

Total number of people = Number of students + Number of parents
= 521 + 174
= 695

Therefore, there were 695 more students than parents."
Response:  We know that there were 61 parents and 177 students in total. The program could accommodate 44 people. Therefore, we need to find out how many people are missing from the total number of participants. To do this, subtract the maximum capacity (44) from the total number of participants (288): 288 - 44 = 244 So, there were 244 people present at the event.
"Response:  If the cave is 919 feet deep and they have to travel 1307 feet, then we can calculate the depth of the cave as follows:

Depth = Distance traveled / Initial depth
= 1307 ft / 919 ft
= 1.42 times the initial depth
So, the end of the cave is approximately 1420 - 919 = 501 feet deeper than the starting point."
Response:  We know that the depth of the cave is 1218 feet and they have already flown 849 feet into it at a speed of 17 km/h. To find out how far they are from the end of the cave, we can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time + Initial Position. In this case, the initial position is 0 feet (since they started flying from the entrance), the speed is 17 km/h, and the time is the distance traveled so far divided by the speed. So, we can calculate the distance to the end of the cave as follows: Distance = 17 km/h x (849 ft / 17 km/h) + 0 ft = 5365 ft + 0 ft = 5365 ft The last term represents their starting position, which is 0 feet since they began flying from the entrance. Therefore, if they fly for another 5365 feet at a speed of 17 km/h, they will reach the end of the cave.
"Response:  If they are currently at 659 feet and need to reach the end of the cave which is 762 feet deep... how far away are they from reaching the end of the cave?

To find out, we can subtract the current height (659 feet) from the desired depth (762 feet):

762 - 659 = 83 feet

So, they have 83 feet left to go before reaching the end of the cave."
Response:  We know that six goldfish were left behind after the Zwerfhondens visited the pond and ate eight fish initially brought there by Paige. So, we have to find out how many fish are missing now. To do this, we need to subtract the number of fish eaten by the Zwerfhondens from the initial number of fish brought by Paige. Therefore, the answer is: 6 (missing fish) = 8 - 6 = 2.
Response:  If Paige fed 7 goldfish and 12 more fish in the pond, then there were initially 7 + 12 = 19 fish in the pond. Now, if hounds are eating them up, we know that 15 fewer fish are left in the pond. Therefore, the number of fish remaining in the pond is 19 - 15 = 4 fish. So, 4 fish have disappeared or been eaten by the hounds.
Response:  If Paige fed 16 goldfish and 71 more fish in the pond, then there were initially 87 fish (16 + 71) in the pond. Now, we are told that two more goldfish have been added to the pond. So, the total number of fish in the pond after adding the new ones is: 87 + 2 = 90. Therefore, 90 - 16 = 74 goldfish are missing or have disappeared from the pond.
Response:  We know that Paige had 15 goldfish in the pond and five of them were eaten by dogs. So, we have to find out how many fish are left after the dogs ate some of them. To do this, we can use subtraction. The number of goldfish left is equal to the original number minus the number that was eaten. In this case, the original number is 15, and the number that was eaten is 5. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond (15 - 5 = 10).
Response:  The chef started with 43 apples and made x tarts. After making the tarts, he had 2 apples left. So, we can write an equation: 43 = x + 2. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 45 (since there are 45 apples in total): 43 / 45 = x / 45. Solving for x, we get: x = 7. Therefore, the chef used 7 apples to make the tarts.
Response:  The chef started with 58 apples and used some to make tarts, so he has X - 35 = Y apples left. Since we know that X is equal to 58, we can set up the equation: X - 35 = Y. Solving for Y gives us: Y = 23. So there are 23 apples left.
Response:  The chef started with 40 apples and 54 peaches. After making some tarts, he had 39 apples left. So, he used 1 apple in his tarts.
Response:  If Adam has 11 action figures per plank and his room has 4 planks, then he can have 4 x 11 = 44 action figures in total. However, since each plank has 40 cabinets, Adam cannot place all 44 action figures on each plank. Therefore, the maximum number of action figures that Adam can hold is 44 / 4 = 11 action figures per plank.
Response:  We know that Adam has 10 action figures and his room can hold 8 action figures. So, we need to find out how many planks he needs to place the remaining two action figures.  Since each plank can hold one action figure, we divide 10 (the number of action figures) by 8 (the capacity of the room):  $ \frac {10}{8} = 1.25$ planks. Therefore, Adam needs 1.25 planks to place all ten action figures in his room.
Response:  If Adam has 8 action figure characters and 10 boxes for each of the four boards in his room, then he will have 8 x 10 = 80 items in total. Since there are 4 boards, this means that each board can hold up to 20 items (80 / 4). So, the number of items that could be placed on each board is 20.
Response:  We know that there are 10 gardens with 544 pots each. So, the total number of pots is 10 x 544 = 5440. Since each pot has 32 flowers, we have 5440 x 32 = 176880 flowers in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 176880.
Response:  We know that there are 466 pots and each pot has 53 flowers and 181 stalks. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of flowers = 53 x number of pots Total number of flowers = 53 x 466 = 23,970 Number of stalks = 181 x number of pots Total number of stalks = 181 x 466 = 84,916 Therefore, there are 23,970 flowers and 84,916 stalks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 pots and each pot has 71 flowers. So, we have 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers in total. Additionally, each pot also contains 91 stalks of wheat, so the total number of flowers is equal to the sum of all the flowers plus the stalks of wheat. Therefore, the final answer is 9671 + 91 = 9762 flowers in total.
Response:  We know that each pot has 40 flowers and there are total 400 flowers. So, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers per pot to find out how many pots there are: Number of flowers = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot = 400 / 40 = 10 pots. Therefore, there are 10 pots in total.
Response:  We know that there are 4502 Skittles and 4276 Wiskas in Steven's collection. If we organize them into groups of 154 each, then we can calculate how many groups there will be as follows: Number of groups = Total number of items / Number per group = 4502 + 4276 = 8778 / 154 = 57 groups So, there will be 57 groups of Skittles and Wiskas if they are organized together in Steven's collection.
Response:  We know that there are 3941 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has 4950 wiskers. If we divide the number of wiskers by the number of Skittles, we get: Number of groups = Total number of wiskers / Total number of Skittles = 4950 / 3941 = 121 groups. Therefore, each group contains 495/121 = 4 wiskers.
Response:  We know that there are 896 Skittles in Steven's collection and he has divided them into 8 groups of equal size. Therefore, we can say that each group contains an equal number of Skittles (i.e., 112 Skittles per group). So, if we divide 896 by 8, we get the total number of groups as follows: 896 / 8 = 112 groups.
Response:  We know that there are 270 students at the school and each class has 5 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of classes = Total number of students / Number of students per class. In this case, we have: Number of classes = 270 / 5 = 54 classes. Therefore, there are 54 classes in total.
Response:  We know that there are 304 classes and each class has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class  Number of students = 304 x 75  Number of students = 22,500  Therefore, there were 22,500 students in total at the school.
