Response:  On Monday (week one), Zhu Liya played hide and seek with 18 children. On Tuesday (week two), she played with 10 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is: 18 - 10 = 8 more children. Therefore, Zhu Liya played with 8 more children on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (week one), Zhu Liya played hide and seek with 11 children. On Tuesday (week two), she played with 12 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on these two days is: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Zhu Liya played with 1 more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
"Response: 

On Monday (weekday), she played hide and seek with 5 children. So, the number of children she played with on Monday is 5.

On Tuesday (weekday), she played hide and seek again with some other children. Let's assume the number of children she played with on Tuesday is x.

Total number of children she played with = Number of children she played with on Monday + Number of children she played with on Tuesday
= 5 + x

Now, we are told that if she had played with all 15 children, then she would have played with them on both Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

Number of children she played with on Monday + Number of children she played with on Tuesday = 15

Solving for x, we get:
x = 10

So, she played with 10 children on Tuesday."
Response:  On Monday, she played hide and seek with 5 children ( herself included). On Tuesday, she played with 14 more children. So in total, she played with 5 + 14 = 19 children.
"Response:  If she played with more than 12 children on Monday (weekday), then she must have played with at least 12 + x children on Tuesday (weekend). So, we can write an equation as follows: 
x = 12 + (number of children she played with on Monday) - 12 
Now, let's substitute the value from the question into this equation: 
x = 12 + (16 - 12) = 12 + 4 = 16 
Therefore, she played with 16 children on Tuesday (weekend)."
Response:  If she played with 14 children on Monday and 8 children on Tuesday, then she must have played with at least 6 more children on Monday than on Tuesday. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday is 6. Therefore, she played with 6 + 8 = 14 children in total.
"Response: 
Week 1 (Monday): Zhang Li played with 17 children.
Week 2 (Tuesday): Zhang Li played with 15 children.
Week 3 (Wednesday): Zhang Li played with 2 children.
Total number of children Zhang Li played with = 17 + 15 + 2 = 44 children."
"Response:  
Week one (Monday to Friday): 
* 朱莉娅 and 15 children play hide-and-seek for 5 days.
Total number of children playing hide-and-seek = 15.
Week two (Saturday and Sunday): 
* 朱莉娅 and 18 children play hide-and-seek for 2 days.
Total number of children playing hide-and-seek = 18.
Now let's add up the total number of children playing hide-and-seek in both weeks: Total number of children playing hide-and-seek = 15 + 18 = 33. So, 朱莉娅 plays hide-and-seek with 33 children in total."
"Response: 
Week 1 (Monday): 朱莉娅 and 5 children play hide-and-seek.
Week 2 (Tuesday): 朱莉娅 and 9 children play hide-and-seek.
So, in total, 朱莉娅 played hide-and-seek with 14 children (5 + 9)."
"Response: 
Week 1: 朱莉娅 and two children play hide-and-seek. (So, there are 3 children in total.)
Week 2: 朱莉娅 and 14 children play hide-and-seek. (So, there are 17 children in total.)
Week 3: 朱莉娅 and 16 children play hide-and-seek. (So, there are 33 children in total.)
Now, let's find out how many children 朱莉娅 played hide-and-seek with in total:
Total number of children = Number of children in Week 1 + Number of children in Week 2 + Number of children in Week 3
= 3 + 17 + 33
= 63
Therefore, 朱莉娅 played hide-and-seek with 63 children in total."
"Response: 
Week one (Monday): Zhang Li played with 10 children.
Week two (Tuesday): Zhang Li played with 7 children.
Week three (Wednesday): Zhang Li played with 96 children.
So, in total, Zhang Li played with 10 + 7 + 96 = 113 children.
Therefore, she played with more children on Wednesday than on Monday and Tuesday combined."
"Response: 
Week one: 朱莉娅 and 14 children played hide-and-seek. (So, she played with 14 children)
Week two: She played with 2 children. (So, she played with 16 children in total - 14 from week one + 2 from week two)
Week three: She played with 8 children. (So, she played with 24 children in total - 16 from week one + 8 from week three)
Now, let's find out how many more children she played with in week three than in week one:
24 (week three) - 14 (week one) = 10
Therefore, 朱莉娅 starred week one compared to week three has 10 more children."
Response:  On Monday (week one), Zhu Liya played with 8 children. On Tuesday (week two), she played with 11 children. On Wednesday (week three), she played with 9 children. So, the difference between the number of children Zhu Liya played with on Tuesday and Wednesday is: 11 - 9 = 2 more children. Therefore, Zhu Liya played with 2 more children on Tuesday than on Wednesday.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Zhu Li played with 15 children in total. On Wednesday, she only played with 7 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of children she played with on Wednesday is: 15 - 7 = 8. Therefore, Zhu Li played with 8 more children on Monday and Tuesday than she did on Wednesday.
"Response: 
Week 1 (Monday): Zhu Li and 13 children played hide-and-seek.
Week 2 (Tuesday): Zhu Li and 10 children played something else.
Week 3 (Wednesday): Zhu Li and 15 children played poker.
So, in total, Zhu Li played with 13 + 10 + 15 = 48 children."
"Response: 
Week 1 (Monday): Zhu Li and 7 children play hide-and-seek.
Week 2 (Tuesday): Zhu Li and 13 children play hide-and-seek.
Week 3 (Wednesday): Zhu Li and 20 children play card games.
Total number of times Zhu Li played hide-and-seek = 7 + 13 + 20 = 40 times."
Response:  On Monday, she played hide and seek with 12 children for 5 hours (since it took her 5 hours to find all of them). So, in total, she spent 5 hours playing hide and seek with 12 children. On Tuesday, she played hide and seek with 14 children for 4 hours (since it took her 4 hours to find all of them). So, in total, she spent 4 hours playing hide and seek with 14 children. Therefore, she spent a total of 9 hours (5 + 4) playing hide and seek with both groups of children combined.
Response:  On Monday, she played with 19 children and spent 2 hours playing hide-and-seek. So, she spent 2/19 = 0.10 hours per child. On Tuesday, she played with 18 children and spent 3 hours playing hide-and-seek. So, she spent 3/18 = 0.17 hours per child. Now, let's find out how many more children she played with on Monday than on Tuesday: Number of children she played with on Monday - Number of children she played with on Tuesday = 19 - 18 = 1 Therefore, she played with 1 more child on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response:  On Monday (Day 1), Zhu Li Ai played hide and seek with 5 children. On Tuesday (Day 2), she played with 6 children. So, the difference between the number of children she played with on Day 1 and Day 2 is: 6 - 5 = 1 child. Therefore, Zhu Li Ai played with one more child on Tuesday than she did on Monday.
Response:  On Monday (Weekday), she played with 4 children. So, the number of children she played with on Weekdays is 4. Now, let's come to Saturday (Weekend). She played with 18 children on Saturday. Therefore, the total number of children she played with = Number of children she played with on Weekends + Number of children she played with on Weekdays = 18 + 4 = 22 children.
Response:  On Monday (week one), she played with 3 children and on Thursday (week two), she played with 4 children. So, in total, she played with 3 + 4 = 7 children. Now, let's compare this number to the number of children she played with on Monday (week one). She played with 6 children on Monday, so we can conclude that she played with 7 - 6 = 1 more child on Monday than she did on Thursday. Therefore, the difference between the number of children she played with on Monday and Thursday is 1 child.
Response:  If Bobby first ate some sugar candies and then ate 25 more, that means he ate a total of 25 + x = 43 candies, where x is the number of candies he initially ate. So, we can set up an equation based on this information: 25 + x = 43. To solve for x, we can subtract 25 from both sides of the equation: x = 18. Therefore, Bobby initially ate 18 sugar candies.
Response:  Bobby first ate 28 pieces of candy, then he ate another 42 pieces, and finally, he ate an additional 63 pieces. So, in total, Bobby ate 28 + 42 + 63 = 133 pieces of candy.
Response:  Bobby first ate 33 pieces of candy and then he ate another 4 pieces. So, in total, he has eaten 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy. Then, he also ate 14 pieces of chocolate. Therefore, the total number of sweets that Bobby has eaten is 37 (candy) + 14 (chocolate) = 51.
Response:  Bobby first ate 38 pieces of candy and then he ate another 36 pieces. So far, he has eaten a total of 74 pieces of candy (38 + 36 = 74). Then, he also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. To find out how many more pieces of candy Bobby ate than chocolate, we can subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total number of candies he ate: 74 - 16 = 58. Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate.
Response:  First, Bobby had 20 pieces of candy and he ate 34 pieces, so he has left with 20 - 34 = -14 pieces of candy. Then, he ate another 18 pieces, so now he has -14 + 18 = 3 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has eaten a total of 3 pieces of candy.
Response:  First, Bobby had 21 pieces of candy and he ate 5 pieces. So, now he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left. Then, he ate another 9 pieces of candy. So, now he has 16 + 9 = 25 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has 25 pieces of candy left.
Response:  At first, Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. Then he ate some candy and left 5 pieces behind. So, at this point, he had 22 - 5 = 17 pieces of candy remaining. Finally, he ate another 5 pieces of candy, leaving him with 17 - 5 = 12 pieces of candy remaining. Therefore, Bobby initially had 12 pieces of candy.
Response:  If Bobby has 19 pieces of candy and he eats 2 pieces, then he will have 19 - 2 = 17 pieces of candy left. So, there are 17 pieces of candy left for him to eat.
Response:  If Bobby has 32 pieces of candy and he eats some, then he will have less than 32 pieces of candy left. We don't know how many pieces of candy he ate, but we do know that he still has 20 pieces of candy left after he eats some. So, if he ate x pieces of candy, then he will have 32 - x pieces of candy left. Therefore, the number of pieces of candy he ate is equal to 32 - 20 = 12.
Response:  If Bobby had initially 36 pieces of candy and he ate 17, then he has 36 - 17 = 19 remaining pieces of candy. Then, he eats another 15, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 remaining pieces of candy. Therefore, Bobby still has 4 pieces of candy left.
Response:  If Bobby has eaten 23 pieces of candy and initially had 30 pieces, then he still has 7 pieces of candy left (30 - 23 = 7).
"Response:  
1. 艾伦 (Alice) has 5 balloons.
2. 杰克 (Jack) has 3 balloons.
3. Alice has more balloons than Jack.
So, the difference between Alice and Jack is 5 - 3 = 2 balloons.
Therefore, Alice has 2 extra balloons compared to Jack."
"Response:  
Jake brought 3 balls to the park and Ellen brought 2 balls to the park. So, in total, Jake has 3 + 2 = 5 balls at the park. Therefore, Jake has more balls than Ellen at the park."
Response:  If Aaron brought 2 balls and Jack brought x balls, then together they have 2 + x balls in total. Since they went to the park together, the number of balls they had between them is equal to the number of balls they found at the park. So, we can write an equation as follows: 2 + x = 3 (balls found at the park) Now, let's solve for x: x = 1 (since there are 3 balls found at the park) Therefore, Jack brought 1 ball to the park.
Response:  Jack brought 6 balls to the park and Ellen brought 10 balls to the park. So, if Jack brought more balls than Ellen, then Ellen must have brought fewer balls than Jack. Therefore, the difference between the number of balls Ellen brought and the number of balls Jack brought is 6 - 10 = -4.
Response:  If Aaron brought 5 balls to the park, and Jack brought more than Aaron by 6 balls, then Jack must have brought at least 11 balls (5 + 6 = 11) to the park. Therefore, the answer is 11.
"Response:  
1. Allan brought 3 balls to the park. + Jake brought 5 balls to the park = Total number of balls at the park = 8 (3 + 5)

1. 艾伦 bring 5 balls to the park. (5)
2. Jake brings 6 more balls to the park. (6 + 5 = 11)
3. Jake buys 3 more balls in the park. (11 + 3 = 14)
Therefore, Jake brings a total of 14 balls to the park."
"Response:  
1. 艾伦带了3个气球，每个气球可以容纳多少球？ (Let's assume each balloon can hold multiple balls)
Balloons can hold multiple balls = 3
2. 杰克带了5个气球，每个气球可以容纳多少球？ (Let's assume each balloon can hold multiple balls)
Balloons can hold multiple balls = 5
3. Total number of balls carried by both 艾伦 and 杰克 = Number of balls carried by 艾伦 + Number of balls carried by 杰克
Total number of balls = 3 + 5 = 8
Therefore, 艾伦 and 杰克 have a total of 8 balloons in the park."
"Response:  
Elen (E) brought 7 balloons and 5 balls to the park. 
Jack (J) brought 6 balloons and 4 balls to the park. 
So, in total, Elen and Jack have 7 + 6 = 13 balloons and 5 + 4 = 9 balls at the park."
Response:  If Aaron brought 5 balloons and he and Jack together brought 6 balloons to the park, then Jack must have brought 1 more balloon than Aaron. So, Jack brought 6 - 5 = 1 balloon to the park.
"Response: 

1. 艾伦 (Alice) brought 2 balls to the park.
2. She bought 3 more balls in the park.
3. Jake brought 6 balls to the park.

So, the total number of balls Alice had + the total number of balls Jake had = 9 (2 + 3 + 6).
Therefore, Jake has 7 more balls than Alice (9 - 2 = 7)."
"Response:  
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. 
To find out how many more hours he studies English than Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent studying Chinese from the time spent studying English. 
So, the difference is:  6 - 2 = 4 hours. 
Therefore, Ryan studies English for 4 more hours than he studies Chinese."
"Response:  
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 7 hours studying Chinese. 
To find out how many more hours he studies Chinese than English, we need to subtract the time spent studying English from the time spent studying Chinese. 
So, the difference is: 7 - 6 = 1 hour. 
Therefore, Ryan studies Chinese for 1 more hour than he studies English."
Response:  If he spends 3 hours studying English every day and also spends some time learning Chinese, then he spends a total of 4 hours studying each day. So, if he studies English for 3 hours per day, he must spend x hours studying Chinese, where x is the difference between 4 and 3, which is 1 hour. Therefore, he spends 1 hour studying Chinese. 
Response:  If he spends 7 hours studying English every day and also spends some time learning Chinese, if he studies English for more than twice as long as he does Chinese, then we can conclude that he spends x hours studying Chinese. So, let's assume that he spends x hours studying Chinese. Now, we know that he spends 7x - 14 = 53 hours studying English every day. Therefore, he spends 53 hours studying English per day.
Response:  If he spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day and also spends some time learning English, then we can assume that his daily study time for English is greater than 5 hours - 2 = 3 hours. So, he spends 3 hours studying English every day.
Response:  If he spends 6 hours studying English and 7 hours studying Chinese every day, then in total, he will have studied for 30 hours (6 x 5 = 30) during the 5 days. So, he has spent a total of 150 hours studying both languages combined (30 hours x 2 = 60).
Response:  If he spends 6 hours studying English and 5 hours studying Chinese every day, then in total, he will have studied for 12 hours (6 + 5 = 12) per day. Now, if he studies for 2 days, he will have studied for a total of 24 hours (12 x 2 = 24).
"Response:  If he spends 5 hours studying English every day and 4 hours studying Chinese every day, then in one day, he will spend:
English = 5 hours/day x 1 day = 5 hours
Chinese = 4 hours/day x 1 day = 4 hours
Now, if he studies for 6 days, he will have studied:
English = 5 hours/day x 6 days = 30 hours
Chinese = 4 hours/day x 6 days = 24 hours
Therefore, he has spent a total of 30 + 24 = 54 hours studying Chinese."
"Response:  If he spends 4 hours studying English and 6 hours studying Chinese every day, then in one day (Day 1), he will spend:
English = 4 hours/day x 1 day = 4 hours
Chinese = 6 hours/day x 1 day = 6 hours
In total, he spent 4 + 6 = 10 hours studying that day.
Now, let's find out how many days he studied for a total of 86 days:
English = 4 hours/day x 86 days = 352 hours
Chinese = 6 hours/day x 86 days = 504 hours
Therefore, he spent 352 hours studying English and 504 hours studying Chinese over the course of 86 days."
"Response:  
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day, so he has studied for a total of 6 x 24 = 144 hours in one month. 
He also spends 7 hours studying Chinese every day, which means he has studied for a total of 7 x 24 = 168 hours in one month. 
Finally, he spends 3 hours studying Spanish each day, which adds up to 3 x 24 = 72 hours in one month. 
So, Ryan has spent a total of 144 + 168 + 72 = 482 hours learning these three languages in one month."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 6 hours studying English every day and 3 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he studies English for 6/2 = 3 hours more than Chinese per day. So, Ryan studies English for 3 hours more than Chinese daily."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 7 hours studying English every day and 2 hours studying Chinese. Therefore, he studies English for 7/2 = 3.5 hours per day.
Now, Ryan spends 4 hours studying Spanish every day. So, he studies Spanish for 4/3.5 = 1.11 hours more than he studies English.
Therefore, Ryan spends 3.5 + 1.11 = 4.61 hours studying English compared to Spanish every day."
"Response: 
Ryan spends 2 hours studying English every day.
Ryan spends 5 hours studying Chinese every day.
So, Ryan studies Chinese for 5 - 2 = 3 more hours than he studies English.
Therefore, Ryan studies Chinese for 3 hours more than he studies English every day."
Response:  If he spends 3 hours studying English and 2 hours studying Chinese every day, then he studies Chinese for (3 - 2) = 1 hour more than he studies English. So, he spends 1 hour studying Chinese every day.
Response:  Ryan has studied English and Chinese for 7 days, spending 4 hours studying English each day and 5 hours studying Chinese each day. To calculate the total time he spent learning both languages, we can multiply the number of days by the number of hours he spent studying each language per day: Total hours studying English = 7 x 4 = 28 hours Total hours studying Chinese = 7 x 5 = 35 hours Therefore, Ryan has spent a total of 63 hours (28 + 35) learning both English and Chinese.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tina collected 8 canisters. Then on Tuesday (day 2), she found additional 7 canisters. So, in total, Tina collected 8 + 7 = 15 canisters.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tifanny collected 7 cans. On Tuesday (day 2), she found additional 12 cans. So, in total, Tifanny collected 7 + 12 = 19 cans on days 1 and 2 combined.
"Response: 
Day 1: Tiffany has 4 canisters.
Day 2: She finds more canisters and now she has x canisters.
Total number of canisters = 4 + x
So, x = 6 - 4 = 2
Therefore, Tiffany found 2 additional canisters on Day 2."
"Response:  On Monday, she had some cans in containers (not specified how many). Then, she found 4 more containers with cans on Tuesday. So, the total number of containers with cans is: 
Monday: x containers with y cans
Tuesday: 4 containers with z cans (where z > y)
Total: x + 4 = 8 containers with y + z cans
Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving them, we get:
x = 3 (from Monday)
z = 6 (from Tuesday)
So, there were 3 containers with 6 cans on Monday and 4 additional containers with 6 cans each on Tuesday, for a total of 3 + 4 = 7 containers with 6 + 6 = 12 cans."
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tifanny collected 10 cans. On Tuesday (day 2), she found 3 more cans, so now she has 10 + 3 = 13 cans. On Wednesday (day 3), she found another 7 cans, so now she has 13 + 7 = 20 cans in total. Therefore, Tifanny has 20 cans.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tifanny found 8 cans. On Tuesday (day 2), she found 10 more cans, so now she has 8 + 10 = 18 cans. On Wednesday (day 3), she found 4 more cans, so now she has 18 + 4 = 22 cans. Therefore, after Monday, Tifanny had found a total of 22 cans.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Tifanny collected 3 canisters. Then on Tuesday (day 2), she found additional 7 canisters and 44 bottles. So, in total, Tifanny has 3 + 7 = 10 canisters.
Response:  There are 17 red balls and 16 green balls in the basket. To find out how many more red balls there are than green balls, we can subtract the number of green balls from the number of red balls: 17 - 16 = 1. So, there is one more red ball than green ball in the basket.
Response:  There are 5 red apples and 11 green apples in the basket. To find out how many more green apples there are than red apples, we can subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples: 11 (green) - 5 (red) = 6. So, there are 6 more green apples than red apples in the basket.
Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 10 red cherries and some green cherries in the basket. We don't know how many green cherries there are yet. So, we can say that the total number of cherries in the basket is 10 + x, where x is the number of green cherries. Since there are 15 cherries in total, we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 15. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 green cherries in the basket.
"Response:  If there are 3 red apples and some green apples in the basket, and the number of green apples is 10 more than the number of red apples, then...

Step 1: Let x be the number of red apples (3).
Step 2: Let y be the number of green apples (x + 10).
Step 3: We know that the total number of apples in the basket is equal to the sum of the number of red apples and the number of green apples: 3 + y = 4.
Step 4: Solving for y, we get y = 7. Therefore, there are 7 green apples in the basket."
Response:  There are 7 red cherries, 15 yellow cherries and 8 green cherries in the basket. So, altogether there are 7 + 15 + 8 = 30 cherries in the basket. Therefore, there are 30 cherries in the basket.
Response:  There are 7 red dates, which means there are 7 - 7 = 0 green dates that are more than the red dates. Therefore, there is only one green date that is more than the red dates. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  There are 2 red cherries and 6 yellow cherries in total. So, there are 2 + 6 = 8 cherries that are fewer than yellow cherries. Therefore, there are 8 green cherries that are more than yellow cherries.
"Response:  There are 19 red dates, 11 yellow dates and 12 green dates in the basket. So, we can write this as an equation:
Red dates = 19 Yellow dates = 11 Green dates = 12 Now, let's compare the number of red dates to the number of yellow dates. The number of red dates is greater than the number of yellow dates, so the answer is: Red dates > Yellow dates. Therefore, there are more red dates than yellow dates in the basket."
Response:  There are 6 red cherries and 16 green cherries in the basket. So, there are a total of 22 cherries in the basket (6 + 16 = 22). Therefore, there are 6/22 or approximately 0.27 red cherries and 16/22 or approximately 0.73 green cherries in the basket.
Response:  There are 18 red dates and 14 yellow dates in the basket. So there are 18 + 14 = 32 fruits in total. Since there are more than one of each color, we can say that there are at least 32 red dates and 32 yellow dates in the basket. Therefore, the number of red dates is between 32 and 40 (inclusive), and the number of yellow dates is also between 32 and 40 (inclusive).
Response:  There are 5 red cherries in total, so there must be 5/19 = 0.263 yellow and green cherries. So, there are 14 x 0.263 = 3.78 yellow cherries and 6 x 0.263 = 1.59 green cherries. Therefore, there are 3 + 1 = 4 yellow cherries and 1 green cherry in the basket.
Response:  There are 65 baskets in total. Each basket has either red or green apples. So, there are 7 + 3 = 10 apples in each basket. Therefore, the total number of apples is 65 x 10 = 650 apples.
Response:  There are 11 baskets in total. Each basket has either red or green apples. So, there are 10 + 18 = 28 apples in total. Therefore, there are 28 apples in all 11 baskets combined.
"Response:  There are 6 baskets in total, and each basket can hold either red or green apples. So, there are 6 x 2 = 12 slots for apples in total. Since there are 16 red apples and 18 green apples, we have:
Red apples: 16 / 12 = 13 red apples per basket Green apples: 18 / 12 = 15 green apples per basket Total number of red apples: 13 x 6 = 78 red apples Total number of green apples: 15 x 6 = 90 green apples Therefore, there are 78 red apples and 90 green apples in total."
Response:  There are 7 baskets in total, and each basket has 10 red apples and 2 green apples. So, the total number of red apples is 7 x 10 = 70, and the total number of green apples is 7 x 2 = 14. Therefore, there are 70 + 14 = 84 apples in total.
"Response:  Since there are 7 total fruits in each basket, and each basket has either red or green apples, we can conclude that:

* Each basket contains at most 4 red apples (since there are only 4 red apples in total).
* Each basket contains at most 3 green apples (since there are only 3 green apples in total).

So, if we have x baskets, then:

x <= 4 (red apples)
x <= 3 (green apples)

Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, there are 2 baskets containing fruit."
Response:  There are two baskets and each basket has 4 red apples and some green apples. So, in total, there are 8 red apples (4 x 2 = 8) and X green apples (where X is the number of green apples in both baskets). Since there are 12 apples in total, we can write the equation: 8 + X = 12. Now, we need to solve for X. Can you do that?
Response:  We know that there are 16 balls in total and 13 of them are red. So, the number of green balls is equal to 16 - 13 = 3. Therefore, there are 3 green balls in the basket.
"Response:  If there are 15 baskets and each basket has 19 red cherries and 4 green cherries, then:
Total number of red cherries = 15 x 19 = 285
Total number of green cherries = 15 x 4 = 60
So, in total, there are 285 + 60 = 345 cherries."
Response:  If there are 10 balls in total and each basket has an equal number of red and green balls, then we can assume that each basket has 5 balls (2 red + 3 green). Therefore, there are 10 / 5 = 2 baskets. So, there are 2 baskets.
Response:  There are 6 green balls in total, and each of them has 60 yellow balls surrounding it. So, there are 6 x 60 = 360 yellow balls around the green balls. Now, let's count how many red balls are surrounded by these yellow balls. Since there are only two red balls, they are surrounded by 360 - 2 = 358 yellow balls. Therefore, there are 358 green balls that are more than the number of red balls.
"Response: 
Jerry had 4 action figure toys on his shelf initially. Then he added some more action figures to the shelf later. So, the total number of action figures Jerry has now is:
4 + (number of additional action figures) = 8
Therefore, Jerry added 4 action figures to his shelf in total."
Response:  At first, Jerry had 3 action figures on his bookshelf. Later, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so there are now 10 action figures in total. Therefore, initially Jerry had 3 action figures on his bookshelf.
"Response: 
Firstly, there are 4 action figures in Jerry's room initially.
Later, he adds 6 more action figures to the bookshelf, making it total of 10 action figures (4 + 6).
So, there are 10 action figures in Jerry's room now."
"Response: 
Firstly, there are 5 action figures in Jerry's room initially.
Later, he adds 7 more action figures to the bookshelf, making it a total of 12 action figures.
So, the number of action figures that are more than books is 12 - 9 = 3."
"Response:  
Step 1: Initially, there are 2 action figures and 10 books in Jerey's room. So, the total number of items is 2 + 10 = 12.
Step 2: Later, 4 more action figures were added to the bookshelf. So, now there are 2 + 4 = 6 action figures.
Step 3: Since we know that each action figure takes up space equal to 1 book, then the total number of books after adding 4 more action figures is 10 (initial number) - (6 x 1) = 10 - 6 = 4 books.
Therefore, the number of books on the bookshelf is 4."
"Response: 
Step 1: There are 8 action figures in Jerey's room initially.
Step 2: Later, 10 more books are added to the bookshelf.
Step 3: So, the total number of books on Jeremy's bookshelf is 8 + 10 = 18 books."
"Response: 

Initially, there are 7 action figures in Jerry's room.
Later, he adds 4 more books to his bookshelf, making it a total of 2 + 4 = 6 books.
So, now there are 7 action figures and 6 books on the bookshelf.
To find out how many action figures are more than the number of books, we need to subtract the number of books from the initial number of action figures: 7 - 6 = 1.
Therefore, there is one action figure more than the number of books on Jerry's bookshelf."
"Response: 

Initially, there are 5 action figures and 2 books in Jerey's room. So, the total number of objects is 5 + 2 = 7.

Later, he adds 9 more books to the bookshelf, making it 9 + 2 = 11 objects in total.

So, the number of books that are more than the number of action figures is 11 - 7 = 4."
"Response: 
Step 1: Initially, there are 8 action figure models in Jerry's room.
Step 2: Later, Jerry adds 4 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 8 + 4 = 12 action figures in total.
Step 3: Then, Jerry takes away 5 old action figures, leaving him with 12 - 5 = 7 new action figures on the shelf.
Therefore, the final number of action figures on Jerry's shelf is 7."
"Response: 
Jerry initially had 3 action figures on his shelf. Then he added 4 more, so there are now 7 action figures in total (including the initial 3). Later, he took away some old ones, but we don't know how many exactly. So, the final number of action figures on Jerry's shelf is 7 - X, where X is the number of old action figures he took away. Therefore, the answer is 7 - X."
"Response: 
Jerry initially had 7 action figures on his shelf. Then he added some new ones and removed 10 old ones. So, the total number of action figures on Jerry's shelf after these operations is:
7 + (new ones) - 10 =?
We are asked that there are currently 8 action figures on Jerry's shelf. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:
? = 8
Now, let's solve for ""?"" using substitution. We know that the total number of action figures on Jerry's shelf is equal to 8, so we can write:
? = 8
Substituting the value given in the problem statement, we get:
7 + (new ones) - 10 = 8
Simplifying the equation, we get:
4 = (new ones)
Since each new action figure adds 1 to the total number of action figures on the shelf, we can conclude that Jerry added 4 new action figures to his shelf.
Therefore, the answer is 4."
Response:  At first, Jerry put 3 action figure toys on his bookshelf. Later, he added 2 more and took away 7 old ones, so there are now 10 action figures in total on the shelf. Therefore, Jerry initially placed 3 action figures on the bookshelf.
Response:  At first, Jerey had 9 action figure toys on his bookshelf. Then he added 7 more action figures, so now he has 9 + 7 = 16 action figure toys on his bookshelf. If he also has 10 books on his bookshelf, then the total number of items on his bookshelf is 16 (action figures) + 10 (books) = 26. Therefore, there are 26 - 10 = 16 action figure toys on Jerry's bookshelf compared to the number of books.
"Response: 
1. Initially, there are 3 books and 4 action figures on Jerey's bookshelf. So, the total number of items is 3 + 4 = 7.
2. Later, he adds 2 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 7 + 2 = 9 items in total.
Therefore, there are 9 action figures that are not books on Jeremy's bookshelf."
"Response: 
At first, Jerey had 7 books and 3 action figures on his bookshelf. So, there were a total of 10 items (7 books + 3 action figures) on the shelf.
Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf, so now there are 5 action figures (3 original + 2 new).
So, the number of books on the shelf is still 7, but the number of action figures has increased by 2, making it 5 in total.
Therefore, the answer is 7 books and 5 action figures."
Response:  At first, there were 2 birds sitting on the perch. Then more birds flew in to join them, making a total of 6 birds on the perch. So, the number of birds that flew in is 4 (6 - 2 = 4).
Response:  At first, there were some birds sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds came and joined them, making a total of 5 birds on the fence. So, initially, there were 0 birds on the fence.
Response:  We have 4 birds and 46 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, 6 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 46 = 50 birds on the perch.
"Response: 
There are initially 3 birds and 2 storks sitting on the fence.
When 5 more birds come, there will be a total of 8 birds (including the original 3) + 2 storks = 10 creatures in total.
So, the final number of birds and storks on the fence is 10."
Response:  There are initially 3 birds and then 2 more birds join them, making it a total of 5 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 5 birds more than the number of storks (鹳鸟) sitting on the fence.
Response:  There are initially 2 birds and 6 crows. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total, there are 5 birds (including both types). Therefore, there are 5 crows sitting on the fence for every bird of another type.
Response:  We have 4 birds and 6 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, 2 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 4 + 6 = 10 birds sitting on the perch.
"Response: 
There are initially 3 birds and 4 cranes sitting on the perch. So, in total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 birds and cranes on the perch.
Later, 6 more cranes come to join them. So, now there are 7 + 6 = 13 birds and cranes on the perch.
So, the final number of birds and cranes on the perch is 13."
"Response:  
Step 1: There are initially 6 birds and 3 cranes sitting on the fence. So, there are a total of 9 birds (6 + 3 = 9).
Step 2: Two more cranes join them, so now there are 3 + 2 = 5 cranes sitting on the fence.
Step 3: Since we know that there are initially 6 birds, and after adding the two new cranes, there are only 5 cranes left sitting on the fence, then we can conclude that there are 6 - 5 = 1 bird sitting on the fence besides the cranes.
Therefore, there is one bird sitting on the fence besides the cranes."
"Response:  
Step 1: There are initially 4 birds and 3 cranes sitting on the fence. So, there are a total of 7 birds (4 + 3) sitting on the fence.
Step 2: Then, 6 more cranes come to join them. So, now there are a total of 7 + 6 = 13 birds sitting on the fence.
Therefore, there are more cranes than birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  We have 6 birds already sitting on the perch. Then, 4 more birds come and join them. So, now we have 6 + 4 = 10 birds in total on the perch. Finally, 8 more birds arrive to join them, so there are now 10 + 8 = 18 birds on the perch altogether. Therefore, the correct answer is 18.
Response:  There are initially 2 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 5 more birds and 4 cranes join them. So, in total, there are 7 birds (including the initial 2) sitting on the fence. Therefore, there are 6 birds more than the number of cranes (4). Hence, there are 6 birds sitting on the fence that are not cranes.
"Response:  
Step 1: There are initially 3 birds sitting on the fence.
Step 2: 2 more birds join them, making it 5 birds in total.
Step 3: Then, 6 hawks arrive and sit with the other birds on the fence, bringing the total number of birds to 11 (including both types). So, there are 11 birds sitting on the fence in total."
Response:  We have 5 hawks and 3 sparrows initially sitting on the fence. Then, 4 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 9 birds (5 hawks + 3 sparrows + 4 new birds). Since there are already 5 hawks sitting on the fence, the number of hawks minus the number of sparrows is equal to the number of new birds that joined them. Therefore, the number of hawks plus the number of sparrows is equal to 9 - 3 = 6. Hence, there are 6 birds more than the number of sparrows sitting on the fence.
Response:  We have 6 hawks and 2 birds initially sitting on the perch. Then, 3 more birds come to join them. So, in total, we have 9 birds (including both hawks and newcomers) sitting on the perch. Since there are already 6 hawks, that means there are 3 additional birds of other species (newcomers) sitting on the perch. Therefore, the number of hawks exceeding the number of birds is 6 - 3 = 3.
"Response:  
Step 1: There are initially 3 birds sitting on the fence. So, there are 3 birds in total.
Step 2: 6 cranes and 2 birds join them. So, now there are 6 + 2 = 8 new birds joining the group.
Step 3: Now, we need to find out how many cranes are more than the number of birds. In other words, we need to find out how many cranes are excessive.
The total number of birds is 3 + 8 = 11.
So, the number of cranes that are excessive is 6 - 11 = -5.
Therefore, there are -5 cranes more than the number of birds sitting on the fence."
Response:  The first chapter has 48 pages, and the second chapter has 11 pages. To find out how many more pages the first chapter has than the second chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter. So, the difference between the two chapters is: 48 - 11 = 37 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 37 more pages than the second chapter.
Response:  The first chapter has 37 pages, and the second chapter has 80 pages. To find out how many more pages are in the second chapter than in the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the number of pages in the second chapter: 80 - 37 = 43 pages. So, there are 43 additional pages in the second chapter compared to the first chapter.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in the book and we know that Chapter 1 has 60 pages, then the total number of pages in the book is: Total Number of Pages = Number of Pages in Chapter 1 + Number of Pages in Chapter 2 Now, we are told that the total number of pages in the book is 93 pages. So, we can set up an equation using this information: Number of Pages in Chapter 1 + Number of Pages in Chapter 2 = 93pages Chapter 1 has 60 pages, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Number of Pages in Chapter 2 = 93 - 60 = 33 pages Therefore, Chapter 2 has 33 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and we want to find out how many pages the first chapter has. So, let's use the information given in the problem: The second chapter has 36 pages, and the total number of pages in the book is 67 pages. Now, we can start our calculation as follows: Number of pages in the book = Total number of pages - Number of pages in the second chapter = 67 - 36 = 31 pages. Therefore, the first chapter has 31 pages.
Response:  The total number of pages in the book is equal to the sum of the number of pages in each chapter. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Pages = Chapter 1 Page Count + Chapter 2 Page Count + Chapter 3 Page Count Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Total Number of Pages = 66 + 35 + 24 = 125 pages Therefore, there are 125 pages in this book.
Response:  We know that the total number of pages in the book is 91 + 23 + 25 = 149 pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 has x pages, Chapter 2 has y pages, and Chapter 3 has z pages. Since Chapter 1 has more pages than Chapter 2, we have x > y. Moreover, since Chapter 2 has fewer pages than Chapter 3, we have y < z. Therefore, we can solve for x, y, and z using these constraints as follows: x = 91, y = 23, and z = 25. So, Chapter 1 has 91 pages, Chapter 2 has 23 pages, and Chapter 3 has 25 pages.
Response:  We know that there are three chapters in total and each chapter has a certain number of pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 = 35 pages Chapter 2 = x pages Chapter 3 = 3 pages Now, we need to find out what 'x' is. Since Chapter 2 has fewer pages than Chapter 3, we can say that x < 35. In other words, Chapter 2 has at most 35 - x pages. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 is: x - (35 - x) = 18 - (-3) = 21 pages. So, Chapter 2 has 21 more pages than Chapter 3.
Response:  We know that the total number of pages in the book is 3 x 53 = 159 pages. Now, we can calculate the difference between the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Chapter 1 has 53 pages, Chapter 2 has 75 pages, and Chapter 3 has 21 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 is: 53 - 21 = 32 pages. Therefore, Chapter 1 has 53 pages more than Chapter 3.
Response:  The book has 31 chapters and each chapter has 61 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is: 31 x 61 = 1831 pages.
Response:  Since there are two chapters in total and each chapter has pages, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages / Number of chapters So, if one chapter has 10 pages, then the total number of pages is equal to 2 x 23 = 46 pages. Therefore, Chapter 1 has 10/2 = 5 pages.
Response:  We know that there are two chapters in the book and each chapter has a certain number of pages. So, we can write an equation as follows: Chapter 1 = x pages Chapter 2 = y pages Now, we are given that the total number of pages in the book is 81 pages. Therefore, we can substitute this value into our equation to find out the value of y (i.e., the number of pages in Chapter 2): 81 = x + y Now, we can solve for y by subtracting x from both sides of the equation: y = 81 - x Now, we know that x represents the number of pages in Chapter 1, which we were told is 39 pages. Therefore, we can plug in this value for x into our equation to find out the number of pages in Chapter 2: y = 81 - 39 = 42 pages So, the second chapter has 42 pages.
Response:  The total number of campers in the morning is 62. In the afternoon, there are 39 campers. So, the difference between the two numbers is:  62 - 39 = 23. Therefore, there are 23 more campers who went sailing in the morning than in the afternoon.
Response:  The number of people who went sailing in the morning is 52. In the afternoon, there were 61 more people who went sailing than in the morning, so the total number of people who went sailing in the afternoon is 61 + 52 = 113. Therefore, the difference between the number of people who went sailing in the afternoon and those who went sailing in the morning is 113 - 52 = 61 people.
"Response: 

In the morning, there are 15 campers who go fishing.
In the afternoon, some additional campers go fishing.
Total number of campers = Morning + Afternoon
= 15 +?

So, in the afternoon, there are? campers who go fishing.

Answer: Therefore, the answer is 19 campers (15 +?)."
Response:  If there are 7 people who go for a boat ride in the afternoon and 12 people who go for a boat ride in the morning, then we can say that the total number of people who went for a boat ride is 7 + 12 = 19. Since there are 60 campers in total, and only 19 of them went for a boat ride, it means that 41 campers did not go for a boat ride (60 - 19 = 41). Therefore, 41 campers stayed at their campsites during the day to do other activities or relax.
Response:  In the morning, there are 36 campers who go fishing, so in total, there are 36 + 0 = 36 campers who go fishing during that day. In the afternoon, there are 13 campers who go fishing, so in total, there are 36 + 13 = 49 campers who go fishing during that day. Therefore, there are 49 campers who go fishing overall.
"Response: 

In the morning, there are 44 campers who go fishing.
In the afternoon, there are 39 campers who go fishing.
At night, there are 31 campers who go fishing.

So, in total, there are:
44 + 39 + 31 = 104 campers who go fishing throughout the day.
Therefore, the number of campers who went fishing in the morning is more than those who went in the afternoon and at night combined."
"Response: 

In the morning, there are 53 campers who go fishing.
In the afternoon, there are 48 campers who go fishing.
At night, there are 49 campers who go fishing.

So, the difference between the number of campers in the morning and at night is:
53 - 49 = 4.
Therefore, there are 4 more campers who go fishing at night than in the morning."
"Response: 
Morning: 33 people go kayaking.
Afternoon: 34 people go kayaking.
Evening: 10 people go kayaking.
So, in total, there are 33 + 34 = 67 people who go kayaking throughout the day.
Now, let's compare the number of people who went kayaking in the afternoon to those who went in the evening:
34 - 10 = 24 more people went kayaking in the afternoon than in the evening."
"Response: 

In the morning, there are 13 campers who go kayaking.
In the afternoon, there are 21 campers who go kayaking.
Total number of campers = Morning + Afternoon
= 13 + 21
= 34
Therefore, there are 34 campers in total who go kayaking."
"Response: 

In the morning, there are 29 campers who go kayaking.
In the afternoon, there are 26 campers who go kayaking.
So, the difference between the number of campers who went kayaking in the morning and those who went in the afternoon is:

29 - 26 = 3
Therefore, the number of more campers who went kayaking in the morning than in the afternoon is 3."
Response:  In the morning, there are 41 campers who go kayaking and 4 campers who go hiking. Therefore, in total, there are 45 campers (41 + 4) who engage in outdoor activities. In the afternoon, there are 26 campers who go kayaking. So, in total, there are 71 campers (45 + 26) who participate in outdoor activities.
Response:  In the morning, there are 43 campers who go fishing. If some more campers join in the afternoon, then the total number of campers who went fishing is equal to the sum of the morning and afternoon numbers. So, we can write: 43 + x = 46 (where x is the number of afternoon campers). Solving for x, we get: x = 3. Therefore, there were 3 additional campers who joined in the afternoon to make a total of 46 campers who went fishing that day.
Response:  If 瑞秋 took 4 apples from the tree and there were initially 7 apples in the tree, then after she took them, there would be 3 remaining apples (7 - 4 = 3). So, there are 3 apples left on the tree.
Response:  At first, there were 4 apples on the tree. Then, she picked some apples and now there are only 2 left. So, she must have picked 2 apples.
Response:  We know that 瑞秋 (Ruìqiu) picked 7 mature apples from the tree and left 5 immature ones. Now, we need to find out how many immature apples are left on the tree. If 3 of them are mature, then there are 5 - 3 = 2 immature apples left on the tree. So, the answer is 2.
Response:  At first, there were 8 apples on the tree (2 ripe + 6 unripe). Then, 瑞秋 picked 2 ripe apples. So, after picking, there are 6 unripe apples left on the tree. Now, we know that 6 out of 7 remaining apples are ripe (since 瑞秋 picked 2 ripe ones), so the number of ripe apples is 6. Therefore, the initial number of ripe apples was 6.
Response:  At first, there were 8 apples on the tree (6 ripe + 2 unripe). Then, 瑞秋 picked 6 ripe apples, leaving 2 ripe and 4 unripe on the tree. So, initially, there were 8 apples on the tree (6 ripe + 2 unripe).
Response:  At first, there were 3 mature apples on the tree. Then, 瑞秋 (Ruixi) picked 3 mature apples from the tree. So, after picking, there are still 3 mature apples on the tree. Now, 瑞秋 picked 2 more mature apples from the tree, leaving 2 mature apples remaining on the tree. Therefore, initially, there were 3 mature apples on the tree.
Response:  At first, there were 10 apples (7 that 瑞秋 picked + 3 left). Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree. So now, there are 6 apples left on the tree. Therefore, the initial number of apples was 10.
"Response: 
Step 1: 瑞秋 picked 4 apples from the tree. So, initially there were 2 + 4 = 6 apples on the tree.
Step 2: New apples grew on the tree after 瑞秋 picked some. So, now there are 6 + 3 = 9 apples on the tree.
Therefore, there are 9 apples on the tree now."
Response:  If 瑞秋 (Rachel) has 52 apple trees and she picked 2 apples from one of them, then there are 52 - 2 = 50 apple trees left. Now, if she picked 2 apples from each of these remaining 50 trees, then there will be 50 x 2 = 100 apples in total. So, the original number of apples on that particular tree was 100.
"Response:  At first, there were 3 apple trees and each tree had 10 apples (initially). So, in total, there were 3 x 10 = 30 apples initially. Now, let's see how many apples are left after Rachel picked some from each tree: 
* From the first tree, she picked 8 apples, leaving 2 remaining. 
* From the second tree, she picked 6 apples, leaving 3 remaining. 
* From the third tree, she picked 5 apples, leaving 4 remaining. 
So, in total, there are now 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 apples left on all three trees combined. Therefore, the initial number of apples was 30 - 9 = 21 apples."
Response:  If there are 4 apple trees and each tree has 29 apples left, then the total number of apples is: 4 x 29 = 116. So, Su-Rui picked 116 apples in total.
Response:  We know that Ed has more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles and Doug had y marbles initially, then after Doug lost some marbles, he would have y - x marbles left. Since Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the equation: x + 19 = y - 19. Solving for y (the number of marbles Doug originally had), we get: y = 38. Therefore, Doug originally had 38 marbles.
Response:  We know that Ed has 45 marbles and Doug lost 11 marbles at the amusement park. So, Doug had 45 - 11 = 34 marbles initially. Now, we need to find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug. To do this, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the total number of marbles Ed has: Ed has 45 marbles, and Doug has 34 marbles, so Ed is ahead by 45 - 34 = 11 marbles. Therefore, Ed has 11 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has 22 marbles and Doug lost 7 marbles at the amusement park. So, initially, Doug had 22 - 7 = 15 marbles. Now, we are told that Ed has more than Doug, so Ed must have 22 > 15 = 7 more marbles than Doug. Therefore, Doug currently has 15 + 7 = 22 marbles.
Response:  If Ed has 27 marbles and Doug loses 3 marbles at the amusement park, then Doug initially had 27 - 3 = 24 marbles.
Response:  Ed has 24 more marbles than Doug. So, if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has x + 24 marbles. Later, Doug loses 27 marbles and Ed finds 9 marbles. Now, if Doug has x marbles, then Ed has x - 27 + 9 = x + 16 marbles. Therefore, Ed has 16 more marbles than Doug.
Response:  At first, Ed had 36 marbles (29 + 7). Then he lost 17 marbles at the amusement park. So, how many marbles does Ed have now? To find out, subtract the number of marbles he lost from his original total: 36 - 17 = 19. Therefore, Ed has 19 marbles more than Doug.
Response:  We know that Ed has more marbles than Doug. So, if Ed had x marbles initially and lost some, then he will have x - y marbles after losing them. Now, we are told that Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 8 = Doug's initial number of marbles (let's call it d). Therefore, Ed lost y = d - (x + 8) marbles.
Response:  We know that Ed has 91 bullets and lost 21 bullets in the amusement park. So he has 91 - 21 = 70 bullets left. Now we compare Doug's number of bullets with Ed's remaining bullets. If Ed has 70 bullets more than Doug, then Ed is ahead of Doug by 70 bullets. Therefore, the difference between their numbers of bullets is 70.
Response:  We know that Ed has lost 20 marbles and now he has 17 marbles left. So, if we subtract 20 from 17, we get 5. Therefore, Doug currently has 5 more marbles than Ed.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 408 students who suggest adding mashed potatoes and 42 students who suggest adding turnips to the menu. So, we have:

Total number of students = 408 + 42 = 450

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than suggested adding turnips:

Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes - Number of students suggesting turnips = 450 - 42 = 408

Therefore, there are 408 more students who suggested adding mashed potatoes than suggested adding turnips."
"Response:  If there are 479 students who suggest adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 489 students who suggest adding carrots, then we have:

Total number of students = 479 + 489 = 968

So, the number of students who suggest adding carrots is greater than the number of students who suggest adding mashed potatoes by 180 people (489 - 479)."
Response:  According to the question, Sofia requested that 310 students provide specific food type recommendations. Among them, 185 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, while others recommended adding beets. So, there are 185 + x students who suggested adding beets, where x is the number of students who did not suggest adding mashed potatoes. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 185 + x = 310. Now, let's solve for x using algebraic manipulation or substitution method. Solving the equation, we get x = 125. Hence, there are 125 students who suggested adding beets among the remaining 125 students who did not suggest adding mashed potatoes.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Sofia asked for suggestions from 288 students and received recommendations from 264 of them. Therefore, there are 144 students who did not provide any suggestions (i.e., they recommended adding potatoes). So, the number of students who suggested adding potatoes is 144.
Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 457 students in total who provided suggestions for adding specific food types to the menu. Of these, 63 more students suggested adding potatoes than those who suggested adding carrots. So, the number of students who suggested adding carrots is 457 - 63 = 394.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 182 students who suggest adding potato dumplings in the menu and 166 students who suggest adding carrots instead of potatoes if there are more students suggesting carrots than those suggesting potatoes. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Let X be the number of students suggesting carrots.
Then, we know that X + 166 = 182 (since there are more students suggesting carrots)
Now, let Y be the number of students suggesting potato dumplings.
We know that Y + 166 = 182 (since there are more students suggesting carrots)
Subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (1), we get:
Y = 182 - 166
Y = 16
So, there are 16 students suggesting potato dumplings."
"Response: 

Total number of students = 324 + 374 + 128 = 826

So, there are 826 students who have participated in suggesting new food items to be added to the menu."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 257 students who suggest adding potatoes to the menu, 120 students who suggest adding carrots, and 97 students who suggest adding tomatoes. So, we have:

Number of students suggesting potatoes = 257
Number of students suggesting carrots = 120
Number of students suggesting tomatoes = 97

Now, let's find out how many more students suggested potatoes than suggested carrots:

More students suggested potatoes = Number of students suggesting potatoes - Number of students suggesting carrots
= 257 - 120
= 137

So, there are 137 more students who suggested adding potatoes to the menu compared to those who suggested adding carrots."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 144 students who suggest adding mashed potatoes to the menu, and 79 students who suggest adding tomato sauce. Therefore, the number of students who suggest adding mashed potatoes is greater than the number of students who suggest adding tomato sauce by 65 (144 - 79) people.
"Response:  According to the given information, there are 228 students who suggest adding mashed potatoes, 337 students who suggest adding carrots, and 23 students who suggest adding tomatoes. So, we have:

Total number of students = 228 + 337 + 23 = 588

Now, let's find out how many students suggest adding carrots compared to those who suggest adding tomatoes:

Number of students suggesting carrots = 337
Number of students suggesting tomatoes = 23
So, the ratio of students suggesting carrots to those suggesting tomatoes is:

337 : 23 = 14.6 (approximately)"
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who participated in the survey.
Total number of students = 450 + 38 = 488
Step 2: Calculate the percentage of students who recommended adding tofu.
Percentage of students who recommended adding tofu = (number of students who recommended adding tofu / total number of students) x 100%
= (450 / 488) x 100% = 93.75%
Now we know that 93.75% of the students recommended adding tofu, and the remaining 6.25% did not participate in the survey."
Response:  According to the question, there are 218 students who suggest adding potato dumplings and 351 students who suggest only adding mushrooms. So, the total number of students who suggest adding mushrooms is 351 - 218 = 133.
"Response:  According to the question, there are 269 students who suggest adding potatoes, 330 students who suggest adding mashed potatoes, and 76 students who suggest adding tomatoes. So, we have:

Total number of students = 269 + 330 + 76 = 685

Now, let's find out how many students suggest adding mashed potatoes compared to those who suggest adding potatoes:

Number of students suggesting mashed potatoes = 330
Number of students suggesting potatoes = 269
So, the ratio of students suggesting mashed potatoes to those suggesting potatoes is:

Mashed potatoes : Potatoes = 330 / 269 = 1.24

Therefore, there are 1.24 times more students suggesting mashed potatoes than those suggesting potatoes."
Response:  We know that there are 569 girls and 236 boys in the school. To find out how many more girls than boys there are, we can subtract the number of boys from the number of girls: 569 - 236 = 333. So, there are 333 more girls than boys in the school.
Response:  We know that there are 34 girls and 841 boys in the school. To find out how many more boys than girls there are, we can divide the number of boys by the number of girls: Number of boys / Number of girls = 841 / 34 = 25.6 (round to nearest whole number) Therefore, there are approximately 26 more boys than girls in the school.
Response:  According to the question, there are 485 students in total at this school. Among them, 232 are female students, which means that the number of male students is equal to 485 - 232 = 253. Therefore, there are 253 male students at this school.
"Response:  If there are 697 female students and they are more than twice as many as male students (i.e., 228), then we can write an equation based on this information: Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students / 2 
Now let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of male students = 697 - (697 x 1/2) 
Simplifying the expression, we get: Number of male students = 697 - 348 
Therefore, there are 349 male students in the school."
Response:  If there are 635 female students and male students are 510 more than females, then the number of male students is: 635 + (510 x 635) = 945 male students. Therefore, there are 945 male students in this school.
Response:  If there are 868 female students and they are more than male students by 281, then the number of male students must be less than or equal to 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, the total number of students in this school is 868 + 587 = 1455.
Response:  If there are 700 female students and male students are 142 more than females, then the total number of students in the school is: 700 + (142 x 700) = 94200. Therefore, the answer is 94200.
Response:  The initial number of female students is 706 and the initial number of male students is 222. Then, 418 more females join the school, so the total number of female students becomes: 706 + 418 = 1124. Now, we need to add the original number of male students to find the total number of students in the school: 222 + 1124 = 1346. Therefore, there are 1346 students in the school.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 902 + 811 = 1713. Now, 44 more girls have joined the school, so the new total number of female students is 902 + 44 = 946. Therefore, there are 946 female students in the school now.
Response:  The total number of girls in the school initially is 632 + 410 = 1042. Now, 465 more girls join the school. So, the new total number of girls in the school is 1042 + 465 = 1507. Therefore, there are 505 more females than males in this school (1507 - 1002).
Response:  The total number of girls in the school initially is 732 + 682 = 1414. After 8 boys join the school, there are now 1414 - 8 = 1396 girls in the school. Therefore, the number of girls in the school currently is 1396.
"Response:  
Step 1: Find out how many male students there were initially in the school.
From the given information, we know that initially, there are 214 male students in the school. So, the number of male students initially is 214.
Step 2: Find out how many female students join the school.
From the given information, we know that 496 female students join the school. So, the total number of female students in the school after joining is 496 + 135 = 631.
Step 3: Find out how many male students join the school.
From the given information, we know that 910 male students join the school. So, the total number of male students in the school after joining is 214 + 910 = 1124.
Therefore, the number of male students in the school now is 1124."
Response:  We know that there are 308 female students and 318 male students in total. So, we can write this as follows: Female Students = 308 Male Students + 318. Now, let's find out how many teachers are there. According to the question, there are 36 teachers in total. So, we can write this as follows: Teachers = 36. Now, we need to find out what is the ratio of male students to female students. To do this, we divide the number of male students by the number of female students: Ratio of Male Students to Female Students = Number of Male Students / Number of Female Students = 318 / 308 = 1.05. This means that for every one female student, there are almost exactly 1.05 male students. Finally, we multiply the number of male students by the ratio of male students to female students to get the total number of students at the school: Total Number of Students = (Number of Male Students x Ratio of Male Students to Female Students) = (318 x 1.05) = 329. Therefore, the answer is 329.
Response:  We know that there are 315 girls and 309 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 315 + 309 = 624. Now, we need to add the number of teachers to find out the total population of people in the school. According to the question, there are 772 teachers in the school. Therefore, the total number of people in the school (students + teachers) is 624 + 772 = 1396.
Response:  If there are 402 more female students than male students in this school, then the number of male students is equal to 739 - 402 = 337. Therefore, there are 337 male students in this school.
Response:  If there are 458 more female students than male students in the school, then the number of male students is equal to half of the total number of students minus the number of female students. So, if there are 692 female students, the number of male students can be calculated as follows: Number of male students = Total number of students - Number of female students = 692 - 458 = 234 Therefore, there are 234 male students in the school.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 362 + 257 = 619. Now, there are 403 additional female students who joined the school. So, the total number of female students in the school now is 403 + 257 = 660. Therefore, the difference between the total number of male and female students in the school is 660 - 619 = 41.
Response:  Edward has $18 and he spent $16. So, his remaining amount is: $18 - $16 = $2.
Response:  Edward has $13 initially and spends some money. Now he only has $3 left. So, the amount of money that Edward spent is equal to the difference between his initial balance ($13) and his current balance ($3), which is $10. Therefore, Edward spent $10.
Response:  Edward spent $9 first and then $8. So he has $9 + $8 = $17 left now. Therefore, he had $17 - $9 = $8 before spending any money.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Edward spent $16 on books and each book cost him the same amount of money. So, he spent $16 x 92 = $1504 on books. Now, he has $1504 - $16 = $1488 left. Therefore, Edward had $1488 before spending any money on books.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Edward spent $6 on two books. So he has $6 - 2 \* $book price = $6 - (2 \* book price) left after buying the books. Since each book costs the same amount of money, we can say that the cost of one book is half of the remaining amount that Edward has ($6 - (2 \* book price)). Therefore, the cost of one book is $\frac {$6 - (2 \* book price)}{2} = \frac {$6}{2} = $3.
Response:  Edward spent $6 on a book and $16 on a pen, so he has $6 + $16 = $22 left after buying those items.
Response:  Edward spent $4 on books and $3 on pens, so he has $4 + $3 = $7 left after buying them. Therefore, he spent $7 on books and pens combined.
Response:  Edward spent $16 on books and $8 on pens, so he has $19 left after buying both. To find out how much more he spent on books than on pens, we can subtract the amount he spent on pens from the amount he spent overall: $16 - $8 = $8. So, Edward spent $8 more on books than on pens.
Response:  Edward spent $17 and then received $10 from his friend. So he has $17 - $10 = $7 left.
Response:  According to the question, Zachary did 44 push-ups and David did more than Zachary by 58 push-ups. So, if we add both numbers together, we get... (insert calculation here)...which equals 102 push-ups! Therefore, Zachary and David together did 102 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zacari has done 51 push-ups and David has done 44 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups Zacari did than David, we can subtract the number of push-ups David did from the number of push-ups Zacari did: 51 - 44 = 7. So, Zacari did 7 more push-ups than David.
Response:  We know that David did 44 push-ups today in gym class. And we also know that Zackari did more than David. So, if Zackari did x push-ups, then he must have done at least 35 push-ups (since 44 - 9 = 35). Therefore, the answer is 35.
Response:  David did 51 push-ups today in gym class, and Zackari did 49 push-ups. So together they did 51 + 49 = 100 push-ups.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, David did more than Zachary in terms of number of sit-ups and lesser in terms of number of push-ups. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of sit-ups done by David = Number of sit-ups done by Zachary + 19

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

Number of sit-ups done by David = 59 + 19 = 78

So, David did 78 sit-ups."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 44 push-ups and Zachary did 17 sit-ups. So, we can write this as:

David did 44 - 17 = 27 more push-ups than Zachary.
Now, let's find out how many sit-ups David did compared to Zachary. The problem states that David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary by 13. So, we can write this as:

David did x sit-ups, where x is less than or equal to 13.
We know that David did 44 push-ups, so he must have done at least 44 - 17 = 27 push-ups. Therefore, David did a total of 27 + x = 68 sit-ups.
So, David did 68 sit-ups in total."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Zachary did 53 push-ups and David did more than Zachary but fewer than him in sit-ups. So, let's assume that David did x push-ups and y sit-ups. We know from the problem statement that Zachary did 53 push-ups, so David did at least 53 - 17 = 36 push-ups. Now we need to find out how many sit-ups David did. Since David did fewer sit-ups than Zachary, he must have done less than or equal to 53 - 10 = 43 sit-ups. Therefore, the total number of push-ups Zachary did is 53, and the total number of sit-ups he did is 43.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did more than Zachary in terms of number of sit-ups (35 vs 23). However, David did fewer squats than Zachary (3 vs 8). So, we can say that Zachary's total number of sit-ups and squats is greater than David's. Now, let's calculate the difference between their totals: Total Sit-Ups = 35 + 8 = 43 Total Squats = 3 + 8 = 11 Therefore, the difference between Zachary's and David's total numbers of sit-ups and squats is 32 (43 - 11). So, Zachary's sit-ups are 32 more than his squats.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did more abdominal crunches than Zachary (by 38). However, he did fewer hip flexion exercises than Zachary (by 62). So, if Zachary did x abdominal crunches and David did x + 38, then Zachary did y hip flexion exercises, where y = 62 - 38 = 24. Therefore, Zachary did 46 abdominal crunches and 24 hip flexion exercises.
Response:  We know that Zacari today did 19 push-ups in gym class. David did more than Zacari, so he did 39 push-ups. John did fewer push-ups than David, so he did 39 - 13 = 26 push-ups. Therefore, David did 39 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zacari today did 51 push-ups in gym class. David did more than Zacari, so he did 22 + 51 = 73 push-ups. John did fewer than David, so he did 73 - 4 = 69 push-ups. Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.
Response:  We know that Zachary did 15 push-ups and David did 48 (39 + 9). John did fewer than David, so he did x push-ups. Since Zachary did more than John, he did y push-ups. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Zachary's number of push-ups = y - x. Solving for y, we get: y = 2x + 15. Substituting x = 9, we find that Zachary did 26 push-ups more than John. So the answer is 26.
Response:  If David did 30 push-ups today in PE class and he did 37 push-ups total, then he did an additional 7 push-ups beyond his original count of 30. So, Zackary did 30 - 7 = 23 push-ups.
Response:  If David did 56 push-ups and Zackary did 38 push-ups, then together they did 94 push-ups (56 + 38 = 94). Therefore, the answer is 94.
Response:  According to the problem statement, David did 40 push-ups and fewer sit-ups than Zackary. If Zackary did 34 push-ups and 62 sit-ups, then David did 17 less sit-ups than Zackary. So, David did 49 sit-ups (34 - 17 = 17).
Response:  David did 36 backbends and fewer sit-ups than Zackary. If Zackary did 58 backbends and 33 sit-ups, then... (1) David did x backbends and y sit-ups, where x < 58 and y < 33. (2) The difference between the number of backbends that David did and the number that Zackary did is 20 (58 - 36). (3) The difference between the number of sit-ups that David did and the number that Zackary did is 7 (33 - 26). So, we can write an equation: x + y = 20 and x - 7 = y. Solving for x and y, we get x = 42 and y = 29. Therefore, David did 42 backbends and 29 sit-ups less than Zackary.
Response:  David did 27 backbends and 7 sit-ups. If Zackari did 5 backbends and 17 sit-ups, then he did more sit-ups than backbends. So, the difference between his sit-ups and backbends is 7 - 5 = 2. Therefore, Zackari did 2 more sit-ups than backbends.
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 5 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages she needs to complete for math and reading is: 5 - 2 = 3 pages. So, 瑞秋's math homework is 3 pages longer than her reading homework.
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 3 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading comprehension homework. So, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 3 + 4 = 7 pages. Therefore, her reading comprehension homework is longer than her math homework by 7 pages - 3 pages = 4 pages.
Response:  If she needs to complete 5 pages of math homework and more than 7 pages of reading comprehension homework, then we can assume that she needs to complete at least 7 + x pages of reading comprehension homework, where x is the number of pages she needs to complete beyond 7 pages. So, x = 7 - 5 = 2 pages. Therefore, she needs to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension homework beyond the 7 pages required.
"Response:  If 瑞秋 needs to complete 7 pages of math homework and she needs to do an additional 4 pages of reading comprehension homework for every page of math homework she completes, then we can set up the following equation:

Number of pages of reading comprehension homework = 7 - (Number of pages of math homework / 4)

Now, let's plug in the values given in the question:

Number of pages of math homework = 7
Number of pages of reading comprehension homework = 7 - (7 / 4) = 7 - 1.75 = 5.25 pages

Therefore, 瑞秋 needs to complete 5.25 pages of reading comprehension homework."
Response:  If 瑞秋 needs to complete 8 pages of math homework and her math homework is more than reading homework by 3 pages, then she needs to complete 8 + 3 = 11 pages of math homework in total. Therefore, the answer is 11 pages.
Response:  If 瑞秋 needs to complete an 8-page math assignment and her reading assignment is 6 pages longer than her math assignment, then she needs to complete 8 + 6 = 14 pages of reading work. Therefore, she needs to complete 14 pages of reading work.
Response:  If 瑞秋 needs to complete 10 pages of math homework and each page of reading comprehension homework is equivalent to 3 pages of math homework, then she needs to complete 3 x 10 = 30 pages of reading comprehension homework in total. Therefore, she needs to complete a total of 10 + 30 = 40 pages of homework.
"Response: 

1. 瑞秋需要完成2页数学作业，So she needs to complete 2 pages of math homework.
2. She also needs to complete 3pages of reading comprehension homework, so she needs to complete 3 x 3 = 9 pages of reading comprehension homework.
3. Finally, she needs to complete 10 pages of biology homework, so she needs to complete 10 pages of biology homework.

Therefore, in total, 瑞秋 needs to complete 2 + 9 + 10 = 21 pages of homework."
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 9 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 9 + 2 = 11 pages. Now, let's move on to biology homework. The question states that 瑞秋 needs to complete 96 pages of biology homework. So, in comparison to her other two assignments, she has to do much more work in biology - 96 pages vs 11 pages for math and reading comprehension combined.
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 11 pages of math homework and 2 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, the total number of pages she needs to complete is 11 + 2 = 13 pages. Now, let's compare this with the number of pages she needs to complete for biology homework, which is 3 pages. So, the difference between the number of pages she needs to complete for math and biology homework is 13 - 3 = 10 pages.
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 7 pages of math homework, which means she has 7/1 = 7 pages of math work left. Then, she needs to complete 11 pages of reading assignment, which is more than her remaining math workpages. So, we can say that 瑞秋 has 7 - 11 = -4 pages of reading assignments left. Therefore, her reading assignment is less than her math assignment by 4 pages.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that 瑞秋 needs to complete 9 pages of math homework. Therefore, she needs to do 9/4 = 2.25 pages of math homework per day (assuming a 4-day week).

Secondly, we know that 瑞秋 needs to complete 11 pages of reading comprehension homework. Therefore, she needs to read for approximately 11/4 = 2.75 hours per day (again assuming a 4-day week).

Lastly, we know that 瑞秋 needs to complete 29 pages of biology homework. Therefore, she needs to work on her biology homework for approximately 29/4 = 7.25 hours per day (again assuming a 4-day week).

So, in total, 瑞秋 needs to spend around 2.25 + 2.75 + 7.25 = 12.25 hours per day on her homework."
"Response: 
Page number of math homework = 8 pages
Page number of reading assignment = 7 pages
Page number of biology assignment = 3 pages
Total page number of assignments = 8 + 7 + 3 = 18 pages
Therefore, Su-Chun needs to complete 18 pages of assignments."
"Response: 

Page of math homework = 5 pages
Page of reading assignment = 10 pages
Page of biology assignment = 6 pages
Total number of pages to complete = 5 + 10 + 6 = 21 pages
Therefore, Rachel needs to complete 21 pages of reading and biology assignments."
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 2 pages of reading comprehension and 4 pages of math homework. Therefore, the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading comprehension is 4 - 2 = 2 pages. So, the answer is 2 pages.
Response:  According to the question, 瑞秋 needs to complete 4 pages of reading comprehension work, which means she has 4 x 2 = 8 pages of reading material to read. In addition, she needs to complete 7 pages of math homework and 19 pages of biology homework. Therefore, her total number of pages of homework is 8 + 7 + 19 = 34 pages. So, her math homework is 34 - 8 = 26 pages more than her reading comprehension homework.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 6 + 2 = 8 emails.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received is 6 + 8 = 14 emails. Therefore, the answer is 14.
Response:  Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 4 + x emails in the afternoon, where x is the number of emails he received after noon. Since he received 5 emails in total that day, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 1. Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and 5 emails in the evening. Therefore, he received a total of = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14 emails that day.
"Response:  Jack received 5 emails in the morning and 8 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of:

5 + 8 = 13 emails

Therefore, Jack received 13 emails in total."
"Response: 
Jack received 4 emails in the morning and 5 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 9 emails during the daytime (morning + afternoon).
He also received 8 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 17 emails throughout the day (daytime + evening).
Therefore, Jack received a total of 17 emails."
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the morning and 4 emails in the afternoon, so he received a total of 3 + 4 = 7 emails during the daytime. In addition, he received 8 emails in the evening, so he received a total of 7 + 8 = 15 emails overall. Therefore, Jack received 15 emails in total.
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning, and then he received 7 more emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received during the day is 10 + 7 = 17. Now, we are asked how many more emails Jack received at night compared to the daytime. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails he received at night (17) and the number of emails he received during the day (17) is 0. There is no difference, as both numbers are equal.
"Response:  Jack received 9 emails in the morning, 10 emails in the afternoon, and 7 emails in the evening. So, he received a total of:

9 + 10 = 19 emails in the daytime (morning and afternoon)
7 = 26 emails in the evening

Therefore, Jack received a total of 26 + 7 = 33 emails."
Response:  Jack received 10 emails in the morning, then he received 5 more emails in the afternoon, and finally, he received 4 more emails in the evening. So, the total number of emails Jack received is: 10 + 5 + 4 = 19 emails.
Response:  Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon, and some more in the evening. So, he received a total of 6 + 3 = 9 emails that day.
"Response: 
Jack received 3 emails in the morning and then he received 5 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails Jack received that day is:
3 + 5 = 8
Therefore, Jack received 8 emails that day."
"Response: 
Jack received 5 emails and 6 letters in the morning. Then he received 9 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 14 (5 + 9) emails and 13 (6 + 7) letters. Therefore, Jack received a total of 27 messages that day."
"Response: 
Jake received 10 emails and 12 letters in the morning. So, he received a total of 10 + 12 = 22 messages in the morning.
Then, he received 3 emails and 44 letters in the afternoon. So, he received a total of 3 + 44 = 47 messages in the afternoon.
Therefore, Jake received more emails in the afternoon than in the morning by 47 - 22 = 25 emails."
"Response: 
According to the question, Jack received 6 emails and 8 letters in the morning. Then he received 2 emails and 7 letters in the afternoon. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 8 = 14 messages in the morning. In the afternoon, he received 2 + 7 = 9 messages. Therefore, the difference between the number of messages Jack received in the morning and the number of messages he received in the afternoon is 14 - 9 = 5 messages."
"Response: 
Jack received 6 emails in the morning and sent 91 emails. Then he received 2 more emails in the afternoon and sent 74 emails. So, in total, Jack received 6 + 2 = 8 emails in one day."
Response:  In the morning, Jack sent 2 emails and received 4 emails. So far, he has sent + received = 2 + 4 = 6 emails. Then in the afternoon, he received 6 more emails and sent 8 more emails. Therefore, in one day, Jack has sent + received = 6 + 8 = 14 emails.
Response:  Jack received 9 emails in total. If he received 7 emails in the morning and some more emails in the afternoon, then he received a total of 9 emails during the day. So, he received 2 emails in the afternoon.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 5 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 8 emails during the daytime (afternoon + morning). He also received 16 emails in the evening. Therefore, the difference between the number of emails Jack received during the daytime and the evening is:  8 - 16 = -8. So, Jack received fewer emails in the evening than he did during the daytime.
Response:  Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon, and 6 emails in the morning, so he received a total of 9 emails that day (3 + 6 = 9). Since he also received some emails in the evening, let's assume he received x more emails. Therefore, the total number of emails Jack received that day is 9 + x = 10. So, Jack received 10 emails that day.
"Response:  We know that 蚱蜢 (ants) jumped 9 inches and 青蛙 (frogs) jumped 12 inches. So, we can write this as a difference equation: 
distance = 12 - 9 = 3 inches
So, 青蛙 (frogs) jumped 3 inches farther than 蚱蜢 (ants)."
Response:  We know that 蚱蜢 (ants) jumped 31 inches and 青蛙 (frogs) jumped 35 inches. So, in total, they jumped 31 + 35 = 66 inches.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the total distance jumped by all three animals is equal to 36 + 17 + 15 = 68 inches.

Now, let's compare the distances jumped by each animal separately:

* The grasshopper jumped 36 inches.
* The frog jumped 17 inches more than the grasshopper, so it jumped 36 + 17 = 53 inches.
* The mouse jumped 15 inches more than the frog, so it jumped 53 + 15 = 68 inches.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the frog jumped farther than the grasshopper and the mouse."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that 蚱蜢 (ants) jumped 25 inches.

Then, we are told that 青蛙 (frogs) jumped farther than ants, which means they jumped 18 inches more than 25 inches = 43 inches.

Finally, we are informed that 老鼠 (mice) jumped farther than frogs, which means they jumped 2 inches less than 43 inches = 41 inches.

Therefore, the distance that old mouse jumped is 41 inches."
"Response:  We know that:
* The grasshopper jumped 19 inches (48 cm).
* The frog jumped 10 inches more than the grasshopper (59 cm).
* The mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog (79 cm).
So, we can calculate the distance between the mouse and the grasshopper as follows:
Mouse - Grasshopper = Frog + Mouse - Grasshopper = 79 cm + 48 cm = 127 cm
Therefore, the distance between the mouse and the grasshopper is 127 cm."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the total distance jumped by all three animals is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. So, let d be the total distance jumped.

From the question, we know that the cricket jumped 19 inches (or 0.47 meters).
The frog jumped 39 inches more than the cricket, so it jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches (or 0.147 meters) more than the cricket.
The rat jumped 94 inches less than the frog, so it jumped 94 - 58 = 36 inches (or 0.092 meters) less than the frog.

Now, we can calculate the total distance jumped by each animal as follows:
Cricket: d = 19 inches
Frog: d = 58 + 19 = 77 inches (or 0.197 meters)
Rat: d = 36 inches (or 0.092 meters)

Therefore, the frog jumped the farthest among the three animals."
"Response: 

1. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
2. The frog jumped more than the grasshopper and jumped 32 inches.
3. The mouse jumped less than the frog and jumped 26 inches.
4. So, the distance between the mouse and the frog is 32 - 26 = 6 inches.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 6 inches farther than the frog."
"Response:  
Step 1: Distance jumped by green frog = 33 inches (from the question)
Step 2: Distance jumped by cricket = 24 inches (from the question)
Step 3: Distance jumped by mouse = x inches (we are asked to find out)
Step 4: Total distance jumped by all three = Green frog + Cricket + Mouse
Now, let's substitute the values we have obtained from Steps 1-3 into Step 4:
Total distance jumped by all three = 33 + 24 + x
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 47
So, the distance jumped by the mouse is 47 inches."
Response:  We know that the difference between the distance jumped by the grasshopper and the frog is 2 inches. So, if the grasshopper jumps x inches, then the frog jumps x + 2 inches. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 2 = 13 (since the grasshopper jumped 13 inches). Solving for x, we get x = 11. So, the frog jumped 11 + 2 = 13 inches.
Response:  We know that 蚱蜢 (ants) jumped 35 inches and 青蛙 (frogs) jumped 31 inches. So, the total distance they both jumped is: 35 + 31 = 66 inches.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the total distance jumped by all three animals is equal to the sum of their individual jumps. So, let d be the total distance jumped.

From the question, we know that the tadpole jumped 19 inches, which is equivalent to 0.47 meters (since there are 25.4 centimeters in an inch).

We also know that the frog jumped 4 inches more than the tadpole, so the frog jumped 0.04 \* 0.47 = 0.00188 meters more than the tadpole.

Finally, we know that the rat jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the rat jumped 0.04 \* 0.47 - 0.04 = 0.00176 meters less than the frog.

Now, let's calculate the total distance jumped by each animal:

Tadpole: d = 0.47 meters
Frog: d = 0.47 + 0.00188 = 0.470188 meters
Rat: d = 0.47 - 0.00176 = 0.468234 meters

So, the green frog jumped the farthest, followed by the tadpole and then the rat. Therefore, the answer is (D) Green Frog."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that the distance jumped by the frog is 39 inches.

Then, we are told that the grasshopper jumps farther than the frog by 19 inches. So, the distance jumped by the grasshopper is 39 + 19 = 58 inches.

Next, we are informed that the mouse jumps shorter than the frog by 12 inches. Therefore, the distance jumped by the mouse is 58 - 12 = 46 inches.

So, to summarize, the distance jumped by the mouse is 46 inches."
"Response:  We know that:

* The frog jumped 21 inches.
* The frog jumped farther than the mouse (by 25 inches).
* The mouse jumped less than the frog (by 16 inches).

So, we can write an equation based on these statements:

Frog distance = Frog distance + Mouse distance - Mouse distance
= 21 + (-16)
= 37 inches

Therefore, the turtle jumped 37 inches farther than the mouse."
Response:  We know that blue frog jumped 39 inches and cricket jumped 17 inches. So, we can write this as an equation: 39 = x + 17 (where x is the distance blue frog jumped more than cricket) Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation: 22 = x Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find out how many inches blue frog jumped more than cricket: 11 = x Blue frog jumped 11 inches more than cricket.
"Response: 

1. The distance jumped by the frog is 33 inches more than the distance jumped by the mouse. So, if the mouse jumps x inches, the frog jumps x + 33 inches.
2. The rat jumps less than the mouse. So, if the mouse jumps x inches, the rat jumps x - 3 inches.
3. We know that the total distance jumped by all three animals together is equal to 9 English feet (which is equivalent to 30 inches). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 33) + (x - 3) = 9
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 36 = 9
5. Solving for x, we get:
x = 7

So, the rat jumps 7 inches, the frog jumps 80 inches (7 + 33), and the mouse jumps 87 inches (7 + 30)."
"Response:  We know that:
* The distance jumped by the frog is 37 inches more than the distance jumped by the centipede.
* The distance jumped by the rat is less than the distance jumped by the frog by 16 inches.
So we can write an equation based on these two statements:
Frog's distance = Centipede's distance + 37
Rat's distance = Frog's distance - 16
Now we have two equations and three variables (frog's distance, centipede's distance, and rat's distance). Solving for the variable ""rat's distance"", we get:
Rat's distance = 59 inches
Therefore, the answer to the question is 59 inches."
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour (14 - 5 = 9). So she needs to add 9 more cups of flour to make the recipe correct.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 5 more cups of sugar (11 - 4 = 7). So she needs to add 7 cups of sugar.
"Response:  If Mary needs to add more flour than sugar, then she needs 8 cups of flour plus however many cups she has already added. So if she has already added some flour, we need to subtract that amount from 8 cups. Then we can calculate how much additional flour she needs. 
Let's assume she has already added x cups of flour. Then the total number of cups of flour needed is 8 - x. To find out how much additional flour she needs, we divide the total number of cups needed by 2 (since each cup of flour requires 2 tablespoons). Therefore, the answer is: 8 - x / 2 = additional flour needed."
Response:  If Mary needs to add more flour than sugar, and she has already added some flour, then we can start with the amount of flour she has already added. Let's call it x. Then, if she needs to add twice as much flour as sugar, that means she needs to add (2x) flour in total. So, the total amount of flour Mary needs to add is: x + (2x) = 3x. Now, we know that there are 11 cups of flour needed for the recipe, so we can divide the total amount of flour Mary needs to add by 11 to find out how many cups she needs to add: 3x / 11 = x + 2x = 5x. Therefore, Mary has added 5 cups of flour.
Response:  If Mary has already added 3 cups of flour to the recipe and needs to add another 6 cups, then she will need to add a total of 9 cups of flour (6 + 3 = 9). So, the answer is 9 cups.
Response:  If Mary needs 12 bowls of flour and she has already put some in, then she still needs 12 - x bowls of flour where x is the amount she has already put in. Since she has 5 bowls of sugar, we can set up the equation: 12 - x = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So Mary has already put 7 bowls of flour into the oven.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar to make the cake recipe. She has already added 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar. So, she still needs to add 6 + 4 = 10 more cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to use 14 cups of sugar for the recipe and she has already used 2 cups. So, she still needs to add 12 cups (14 - 2 = 12) more sugar.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 12 cups of flour in total according to the recipe. She has already added 11 cups, so she still needs to add 1 more cup of flour. Therefore, the answer is 12 - 11 = 1 cup of flour needed to be added.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add more flour than sugar and salt. So we can start with the total amount of ingredients needed: 10 + 2 + 80 = 92. Since Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, she still needs to add 92 - 7 = 85 cups of flour. Therefore, Mary needs to add 85 more cups of flour to the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 7 more bowls of flour to make the recipe balance. Since she has already added 2 bowls, we need to subtract 2 from 7 to get the remaining amount needed. So, Mary needs to add 5 more bowls of flour (7 - 2 = 5).
Response:  We know that Mary needs to use 6 bowls of flour for her recipe, and she has already used 5 bowls. So, we need to find out how many more bowls of sugar she needs compared to salt. The ratio of sugar to salt in the recipe is given as 8:7. Therefore, if Mary uses x bowls of sugar, she will use (8 - x) bowls of salt. Since Mary has already used 5 bowls of flour, she can only add an additional x - 5 bowls of sugar. So, the number of bowls of sugar Mary needs to add is x = 3.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to use 13 cups of sugar for her recipe and she has already used 2 cups. So, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we can divide the total amount of sugar needed (13 cups) by the amount of sugar she has already used (2 cups): 13 / 2 = 6.5 cups. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6.5 cups of sugar more to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 9 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar to make the cake recipe. She has already added 4 cups of sugar, so she still needs to add 5 cups (9 - 4 = 5) more cups of flour than sugar. Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 + 6 = 11 cups of ingredients to complete the recipe.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add more flour than sugar to make the cake batter. The recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. If she has already added 2 cups of flour, then she still needs to add 7 cups (9 - 2 = 7) more flour to meet the requirement. So, Mary needs to add 7 additional cups of flour to the batter.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 5 cups of sugar and she has already added 11 cups of flour. So, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to be added. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour (11 cups) from the total amount of sugar required (5 cups). This gives us 4 cups of sugar remaining to be added. Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of sugar than flour.
"Response:  If Mary needs to add 5 bowls of flour more than the recipe requires, and the recipe calls for 3 bowls of sugar, then she has already added some amount of flour. So, let x be the number of bowls of flour she has added so far. Then, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 5 = 3 (since she needs to add 5 more bowls)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2 (since 2 is the only integer that satisfies the equation)

Therefore, Mary has added 2 bowls of flour so far."
"Response:  If Mary needs 13 bowls of flour to make the cake and she has already put some in, then she still needs 12 bowls - 💡
So, the correct answer is 12 bowls of flour."
Response:  According to the recipe, Mary needs to add 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. She has already added 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. So she still needs to add 7 + 6 = 13 more cups of flour.
Response:  According to the recipe, Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. She has already added 12 cups of flour and 10 cups of sugar. So she still needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (11 - 10 = 1).
Response:  According to the recipe, Mary needs to add 10 bowls of flour (not 6). So she still needs to add 4 more bowls of flour. Therefore, the answer is 10 - 6 = 4.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 14 - 4 = 10 more cups of flour to make the cake sweeter than the sugar. So she needs to add 10 more cups of flour.
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add salt and sugar according to the recipe. The ratio of salt to sugar is 1:3 (one part salt for three parts sugar). So, if she has already added 2 tablespoons of flour, which is equal to 30 grams, then she needs to add an additional 60 grams of flour to make up for the missing salt. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed is 90 grams (30 + 60 = 90 grams).
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar to make the cake recipe. She has already added 12 cups of flour (which is equal to 3 times the amount of sugar). So, she needs to subtract 3 x 11 = 33 cups of sugar from the total amount needed. Therefore, Mary needs to add 87 - 33 = 54 cups of sugar to the recipe.
Response:  If Mary needs to add 7 bowls of sugar and she has already added 4 bowls, then she still needs to add 3 more bowls of sugar (7 - 4 = 3).
Response:  We know that Mary needs to add 14 - 10 = 4 more cups of flour to make sure the cake is sweeter than the sugar. So she needs to add 4 more cups of flour.
"Response:  If there are 19 bird families that stay in the mountain area during winter and 60 birds fly away to warmer countries, then the number of bird families left behind is:

19 - 60 = -41

So, there are 41 fewer bird families left behind than when the birds flew away for winter."
Response:  If there are 87 bird families that stay in the mountain during winter and 7 of them fly away to warmer countries, then the number of bird families left behind is: $87 - 7 = 80$ families. Therefore, the ratio of bird families left behind to those that flew away is: $\frac{80}{7} \approx 11.43$.
Response:  We know that there are 20 bird families that fly away for winter and only 14 of them come back. So, initially, there were 20 - 14 = 6 bird families living near the mountain.
Response:  We know that 85 bird families stay in the mountain area and we have three groups of birds moving to different continents: 23 to Africa, 37 to Asia, and the remaining 25 to stay in the mountain area. So, the number of bird families left in the mountain area is: 85 - (23 + 37) = 15. Therefore, there are 15 bird families left in the mountain area after some birds migrate to other continents.
Response:  We know that there are 8 bird families in the mountains and they migrate to different regions according to the season. If 42 bird families fly towards Africa and 31 bird families fly towards Asia, then we can calculate the ratio of birds flying to Africa to those flying to Asia as follows: Number of birds flying to Africa = 42 / 8 = 5.25 (approximately) Number of birds flying to Asia = 31 / 8 = 3.875 (approximately) Therefore, the number of bird families flying to Africa is approximately 1.37 times more than the number of bird families flying to Asia.
Response:  We know that there are 38 bird families near mountains and they migrate to warmer countries during winter. If 47 bird families fly towards Africa and 94 bird families fly towards Asia, then we can calculate the ratio of birds flying towards Asia to those flying towards Africa as follows: Number of birds flying towards Asia = 94 Number of birds flying towards Africa = 47 Ratio of birds flying towards Asia to those flying towards Africa = 94/47 = 2.06 So, there are approximately 2.06 times more birds flying towards Asia than those flying towards Africa.
"Response: 
We know that there are 18 bird families in the mountains and they migrate to warmer countries during winter. So, the total number of bird families that migrate is 18.
Now, we need to find out how many bird families migrate to Africa and Asia respectively. We can do this by multiplying the number of bird families with the ratio of birds that migrate to each continent.
Ratio of birds that migrate to Africa = 80/38 = 2.11 (approximately)
So, the number of bird families that migrate to Africa is 80 x 2.11 = 174 bird families.
Similarly, the number of bird families that migrate to Asia is 80 x 0.69 = 54 bird families.
Therefore, the total number of bird families that migrate away from their original habitats during winter is 18 + 174 + 54 = 246 bird families."
"Response:  The original number of bird families is 87. If 18 new bird families join them, then the total number of bird families will be:

87 + 18 = 105

So, there are now 105 bird families living near the mountain."
"Response:  According to the given information, we have:
Number of bird families that migrate south for winter = 59
New bird families from the North arrived at the foot of the mountain = 24
Total number of bird families at the foot of the mountain =?
Now, let's calculate the total number of bird families at the foot of the mountain:
Total number of bird families = Number of bird families that migrate south + New bird families from the North
= 59 + 24
= 83
Therefore, there are 83 bird families living at the foot of the mountain."
"Response:  If there are initially 41 bird families living near the mountain and 27 of them migrate away for winter, then the number of bird families remaining near the mountain is:

$$ \boxed{41 - 27 = 14} $$

So, there are 14 bird families left near the mountain after the migration."
Response:  We know that there are initially 45 bird families in the mountain area and they fly away to warmer countries for winter. Now we want to find out how many more bird families flew away than remained behind. So let's call the number of bird families that flew away as x. Since there were initially 45 bird families, we can write: 45 - x = 86 (total number of bird families) Now we have two equations: 45 - x = 86 and x = 86 - 45 To solve this problem, we need to isolate the variable 'x'. In this case, we can do it by subtracting 45 from both sides of equation 1: 45 - x = 86 Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us: -x = 41 Therefore, there are 41 more bird families that flew away than remained behind.
Response:  We know that there are 41 bird families near mountains and 76 bird families in total (including those near mountains). If 35 bird families fly to Asia, then the number of bird families left in Africa is 76 - 35 = 41. So, the number of bird families that flew to Africa is 41 / 2 = 20 more than the number that flew to Asia. Therefore, the answer is 20.
"Response: 
1. Initially, there were 3 bird species living near the mountain.
2. Then, 26 new bird species arrived from the North Pole to live nearby.
3. After that, 2 bird species migrated to a warmer place for winter.
So, the number of bird species left in the area is:
3 - 2 = 1
Therefore, there are 1 bird species living near the mountain after all the movements."
Response:  We know that Paul received a box of 253 pencils and he lost or gave away 70 of them until the end of the school year. So, the number of pencils left with him is: 253 - 70 = 183 pencils.
"Response: 
Paul received 600 pencils at his birthday party and he lost or sent out 551 of them until the end of the school year. That means he has 49 pencils left (600 - 551 = 49)."
"Response: 

Firstly, Paul received 440 pencils as a gift.

Then, he sent 111 pencils to his friends during the school year. So, the number of pencils he has left is:

440 - 111 = 329

Finally, he lost 106 pencils, so the number of pencils he has now is:

329 - 106 = 223

Therefore, Paul has 223 pencils left."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Paul received 65 pencils as a gift.

Then, he sent out 213 pencils to his friends during the school year. So, in total, he has 65 + 213 = 278 pencils.

Now, we are told that he lost 16 pencils. Therefore, the final number of pencils Paul has is 278 - 16 = 262 pencils.

So, the answer is 262 pencils."
Response:  Paul received 589 pencils and gave away 571 of them to his friends. So he has 18 pencils left (589 - 571 = 18). Now, he lost 161 pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils he has now is 18 + 161 = 179 pencils.
Response:  We know that Paul received 110 pencils and gave away 90 of them to his friends. So he has 20 pencils left (110 - 90 = 20). Now we are told that he lost 412 pencils. This means that he has 412 - 20 = 392 pencils left after losing some. Therefore, the number of pencils he lost is 392 - 412 = -110 pencils.
"Response: 

Firstly, Paul received 563 pencils as gifts from his friends during the school year.
Then he lost 558 pencils, leaving him with 332 pencils.
So, at the end of the school year, Paul had 332 pencils in total."
"Response: 

1. Robert received 52 pencils as gifts during his birthday celebration. (Given)
2. He lost or gave away 535 pencils during the school year. (Given)
3. Now he has 492 pencils left. (Given)

So, the difference between the number of pencils he had after receiving the gift and the number he has now is:

52 - 492 = -440

Therefore, he lost or gave away 440 pencils during the school year."
Response:  We know that Paul received 521 pencils and 66 erasers at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, he had 154 pencils left, which means he must have given away or lost some pencils. However, we also know that he didn't lose any erasers, so the number of erasers he has now is still 66. Therefore, the number of pencils Paul gave away or lost is equal to the difference between the initial amount (521) and the final amount (154), which is 367.
Response:  We know that Paul received 531 pencils and 38 erasers initially. At the end of the year, he had 391 pencils left, which means he lost 140 pencils (531 - 391 = 140). Now, we need to find out how many erasers he had at the end of the year. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he must have had all 38 erasers at the end of the year as well. So, the final answer is: Number of remaining pencils = 391 Number of remaining erasers = 38 Subtraction of number of lost pencils from total number of pencils gives us the number of remaining pencils.
Response:  We know that initially Paul received 601 pencils and 406 erasers. So, in total, he had 1007 items (601 + 406). Now, we are told that at the end of the year, he only had 336 erasers left. This means that he must have given away or lost 669 erasers (1007 - 336 = 669). Since he didn't lose any pencils, the number of pencils he had at the end of the year is still 601. Therefore, the difference between the number of erasers he had at the beginning and the end of the year is 669.
"Response: 
Paul received 300 pencils at his birthday party and he lost or gave away 145 pencils until the end of the school year. So, he has 291 pencils left."
"Response: 

Firstly, Paul received 267 pencils as gifts during his school year.
He lost 231 pencils, so he had 36 (267 - 231) pencils left.
Then, he sent 308 pencils to his friends, which means he gave away 74 (308 - 231) pencils.
So, the number of pencils Paul has now is 36 - 74 = -38 pencils.
Therefore, Paul has fewer pencils than he initially received."
Response:  We know that Robert received 457 rubber erasers and 320 pencils at the beginning of the school year. If he didn't lose any, then he must have used some during the year. So, let's assume he used x number of rubber erasers and y number of pencils. Now, we know that he has 523 rubber erasers left and 320 pencils left. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 457 + x = 523 (rubber erasers) and 320 + y = 320 (pencils). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 137 and y = 283. So, Robert has 137 more rubber erasers than pencils left.
Response:  If there are 11 customers initially and some of them leave, then the number of remaining customers is 11 - x, where x is the number of customers who left. Since there are still 3 customers after some customers have left, we can write an equation: 11 - x = 3. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, the number of customers who left is 8 more than the number of customers who remained.
Response:  If there are initially 3 customers and one server, then after some customers leave, there will be 4 customers left. So, the difference between the number of customers who left and the number of customers remaining is equal to 1 (the initial number of customers). Therefore, the answer is 1.
Response:  At first, there were 9 customers. After 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers, so the total number of customers at one point was 9 + 12 = 21 customers.
Response:  The server has 14 customers initially. If 5 of them leave, then the number of customers left is 14 - 5 = 9. So, the server still has 9 customers.
Response:  The server initially had 13 customers. If some of them left after that, he gained 4 new customers. So, the total number of customers he has now is: 13 + 4 = 17. Therefore, 9 - 17 = -8 customers left.
Response:  At first, there were 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, leaving 12 - 15 = -3 customers. After that, 14 new customers arrived, so now there are -3 + 14 = 11 customers remaining. Therefore, there are currently 11 customers left in the restaurant.
Response:  The service staff initially had 3 customers, and then 4 more people arrived, making it 7 in total (including the original 3). Later, another 4 people came, bringing the total number of customers to 11 (including the initial 3 + the additional 4). Therefore, there were 4 new customers who arrived later.
Response:  The service staff initially had 8 customers, and then some left, leaving him with 5 remaining customers. Later, he gained 99 new customers, so the total number of customers he has now is: 5 + 99 = 104 customers. Therefore, the number of customers who left earlier is: 104 - 8 = 96 customers.
"Response: 
Step 1: The server has 12 customers initially.
Step 2: Some customers leave, reducing the number of customers to 14.
Step 3: More customers arrive, increasing the total number of customers to 24 (10 new + 14 existing).
Therefore, the server currently has 24 customers."
Response:  The person bought a piece of candy worth $2 and then had $3 left. So initially, he had $5 ($2 + $3).
Response:  If 丹 has $4 and he buys one piece of candy that costs $1, then he will have $4 - $1 = $3 left. So, the price of each piece of candy is $3 / 1 = $3.
Response:  Dan spent $4 on the candy bars. If he bought 99 candy bars, then he spent $3 x 99 = $297 on them. So, he has $4 - $297 = $-293 left.
Response:  If 丹 has $3 and he bought 2 candy bars, then he spent $3 / 2 = $1.50 on each candy bar. So, the price of each candy bar is $1.50.
Response:  Dan has $2 and he bought some candy bars. Each candy bar costs either $3 or $6. So, if we assume that Dan bought x candy bars, then the total cost of the candy bars is: $3x + $6x = $9x. Since Dan only has $2, it means that the total number of candy bars he can buy is: $9 / $2 = 4. Therefore, Dan bought 4 candy bars.
"Response:  
Firstly, he spent $2 for the chocolate bar, so he has $7 - $2 = $5 left. 
Then, he spent $3 for the candy, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left. Therefore, he has $2 left after buying both items."
Response:  The total cost of the candy and chocolate is $7 + $6 = $13. So, Danny spent $13 - $4 = $9 on them. Therefore, he spent $9 on the candy and chocolate.
Response:  The total cost of the sweets is $6 + $3 = $9. So, he paid $2 for each sweet. Therefore, he paid more money to buy the chocolate than the candy.
Response:  He spent $2 for candy and $3 for chocolate, so he spent a total of $5 + $2 = $7. So, he spent more money on chocolate than on candy. Therefore, he paid $3 - $2 = $1 more for the chocolate than for the candy.
"Response:  
Firstly, he spent $8 for the candy. So, his remaining money is:
$4 - $8 = $-4
Therefore, he has $-4 left after buying the candy."
Response:  If he had $4 initially and spent $1 on the candy, then he has $3 left ($4 - $1 = $3). So, the price of the candy is $3 / $3 = $1 per piece.
Response:  Dan has $4 and he spent $3 on candy. So, he has $4 - $3 = $1 left.
"Response:  We know that Danny has $3 and he bought 2 candies. So, after buying the candies, he had $3 - x dollars left, where x is the cost of each candy. Since the cost of each candy is equal, we can write:
x = $2 (since there are 2 candies)
So, Danny spent $2 x $2 = $4 on the candies. Therefore, the cost of each candy is $2."
Response:  The boy spent $3 on chocolate and $7 on candy sticks, so he spent a total of $10. Therefore, the cost of buying candy sticks is $10 - $3 = $7 more than the cost of buying chocolate.
"Response:  
Firstly, he spent $4 on something. Then, he bought a chocolate bar that cost him $7. So far, he has spent a total of $4 + $7 = $11. Next, he bought another item that cost $2. Therefore, his total spending is now $11 + $2 = $13. So, he spent more money on the second item than he did on the first one."
Response:  We know that Paul has 115 books in total and he sold 78 of them. So, the number of books left with him is: 115 - 78 = 37 books.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had some books and later sold 137 of them in the car park. So, he has 105 books left now. To find out how many books he initially had, we can divide the number of books he still has (105) by the number of books he sold (137): 105 / 137 = x. Therefore, Paul initially had x books.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 108 books and after selling some of them in the car park sale, he was left with 62 books. So, the number of books he sold in the car park sale is equal to 108 - 62 = 46 books.
Response:  We know that Paul has 50 books initially and he buys some of them in the car park. So, after buying some books, he still has 50 - x books left, where x is the number of books he bought. Now we are told that he has 151 books remaining, so the total number of books he bought must be equal to 151 - 50 = 101 books. Therefore, the answer is 101.
Response:  Paul originally had 2 books and then sold some of them in a car sale event to raise funds for his charity. After that, he bought 150 new books, so he now has 58 books in total. To find out how many books he sold, we need to subtract the number of new books (150) from the original number of books (2). Therefore, Paul sold 148 books (2 - 150 = -148).
Response:  Paul initially had 21 books and sold some of them in the car park. After that, he bought 42 new books, so his current total is 21 + 42 = 63 books. Now, he has only 15 books left, which means he sold more than 63 - 15 = 48 books more than he bought.
Response:  Paul had 71 books initially and sold some of them in the car park. After selling those books, he had 71 - x books where x is the number of books he sold. Then, he bought 38 new books, so now he has (71 - x) + 38 = 116 books. To find out how many more books he bought than the ones he sold, we can subtract x from both sides: 116 - x = 38. Therefore, x = 85. So, Paul bought 85 more books than the ones he sold.
Response:  We know that Paul initially had 108 books and 55 pens. After selling some of them in the car park, he has 66 books and 59 pens left. So, we can write an equation to represent this situation: 108 - x = 66 (books) 55 - y = 59 (pens) Where x is the number of books sold in the car park and y is the number of pens sold. Now we need to solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method. Let's use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for x, we get: x = 108 - 66 = 42 Books were sold in the car park. Substituting this value back into the second equation, we get: 55 - y = 59 y = 7 Pens were sold in the car park. Therefore, Paul sold 42 books and 7 pens in the car park.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some of them in the car park, he has 82 books left and 14 pens left. So, the number of pens he sold is equal to the difference between his initial number of pens (106) and the number of pens he has left after selling (14). Therefore, the number of pens he sold is 106 - 14 = 92 pens.
Response:  If Paul initially had 136 books and sold some of them in the carport, he has 27 left now. To find out how many books he sold, we can subtract the number of books he has left from his initial amount: 136 - 27 = 109. So, Paul sold 109 books.
Response:  We know that Paul has 134 books and gives 39 to his friends. So he has 134 - 39 = 95 books left. Then, in the garage sale, he sells some books and is left with 68 books. Therefore, the number of books sold at the garage sale is 68 - 95 = -27 books.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 153 books and 95 pens. After selling some of them in the car park, he has 13 books left and 23 pens left. So, the number of books sold in the car park is equal to 153 - 13 = 140 books. Similarly, the number of pens sold is equal to 95 - 23 = 72 pens. Therefore, the answer is 140 books and 72 pens.
Response:  We know that Paul had initially 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some of them in the car park, he has 113 books left and 19 pens left. So, the number of pens sold in the car park is equal to the difference between the initial number of pens (42) and the final number of pens (19). Therefore, the answer is 42 - 19 = 23.
Response:  We know that Jessica cut 8 flowers from her garden and put them in the vase. So initially, there were 10 flowers in the vase (the number given in the question). Now, after Jessica added 8 more flowers, there are 10 + 8 = 18 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 18.
Response:  We know that Jessica cut 16 roses from her garden and put them in the vase initially. So, initially there were 16 + 16 = 32 roses in the vase. Now, we are told that there are 23 roses in the vase after Jessica added more roses. Therefore, the initial number of roses was 32 - 23 = 9 roses.
"Response:  
1. Initially, there were 2 flowers in the vase. (From the question)
2. Jexica threw away 4 flowers from the vase. (From the question)
3. She picked some new flowers from her garden and put them into the vase. (From the question)
4. Now, there are 23 flowers in the vase. (From the question)
5. To find out how many flowers Jexica cut from her garden, we need to subtract the number of original flowers from the total number of flowers now in the vase. So, the answer is: 23 - 2 = 21. (Step-by-step calculation)
Therefore, Jexica cut 21 flowers from her garden."
Response:  Jessica threw away 33 flowers and then picked some new ones from the garden to put in the vase. So, initially there were 15 flowers in the vase (the number she started with). Then, after throwing away 33 flowers, there were 15 - 33 = 8 flowers left in the vase. Finally, when she picked some new flowers from the garden, there were 8 + X flowers added to the vase, where X is the number of new flowers she picked up. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase now is 8 + X = 17. So, X = 9. Hence, Jessica picked up 9 new flowers from the garden.
Response:  Jessica threw away 34 roses and picked some new ones from the garden to put in the vase. So, initially there were 21 roses in the vase, then she threw away 34 more, leaving 15 roses. Therefore, the number of roses she threw away is 34 - 21 = 13.
Response:  We know that Jessica has cut 20 flowers from her garden and there were originally 7 flowers in the vase. So, she must have cut 13 flowers (7 - 20 = 13).
"Response: 
Firstly, Jessica cut some roses from her garden and put them in the vase, so there are now 21 roses in the vase.
Secondly, before she cut any roses, there were 12 roses in her garden.
Thirdly, after cutting the roses, she left 12 roses in her garden.
So, the number of roses left in her garden is equal to the original number minus the number that she cut.
Therefore, the number of roses left in her garden is 12 - 21 = -9.
So, there are -9 roses left in her garden."
Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 15. Jessica cut some roses and now there are 17 roses in the vase. So, she must have cut 2 roses. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  
Initially, there were 12 rosebuds and 2 lily flowers in the vase. 
Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden. 
Now, there are 10 rosebuds and 21 lily flowers in the vase. 
So, Jessica cut 2 lily flowers."
Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 5. Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden, so now there are 12 roses and 2 lilies in the vase. To find out how many more roses than lilies there are, we need to subtract the number of lilies from the number of roses: 12 - 2 = 10. So, there are 10 more roses than lilies in the vase.
Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 7 + 12 = 19. Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden, so now there are 11 roses left in the vase. Since the total number of flowers in the vase is still 19 (including both roses and lilies), the number of lilies must be 19 - 7 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 more lilies than roses in the vase.
Response:  If there were initially 3 roses in the vase and Jessica picked 16 more from the garden (total of 19), then we can calculate how many roses she picked as follows: Number of roses picked = Total number of roses - Initial number of roses = 19 - 3 = 16 Therefore, Jessica picked 16 roses from the garden.
"Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 13. Jessica cut some roses and now there are 14 roses left. So she must have cut 1 rose. 
Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from the vase."
Response:  We know that Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden. Initially, there were 16 rosebuds and 3 lily flowers in the vase. After cutting, there are 7 lily flowers and 13 rosebuds in the vase. So, Jessica cut 3 + 10 = 13 lily flowers and 16 - 7 = 9 rosebuds. Therefore, she cut 9 lily flowers and 9 rosebuds.
Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 6 + 20 = 26 roses. Jessica picked some roses and lilies from the garden, so there are now 21 + 22 = 43 flowers in the vase (including both roses and lilies). Since the total number of roses before was 6 + 20 = 26, and after picking, there were 21 + 22 = 43 flowers in total, we can see that the number of roses after picking is 26 - 43 = -17 roses. So, the number of roses left in the vase after picking is negative 17.
Response:  The original number of roses in the vase is 9. Jessica cut some roses and lilies from the garden, so now there are 3 fewer roses (9 - 3 = 6) and 3 more lilies (6 + 3 = 9). So, the total number of lilies in the vase is 9. Since the number of rose has decreased, we can conclude that the number of lilies in the vase is greater than the number of roses. Therefore, the number of lilies in the vase is 9 - 3 = 6 more than the number of roses. Answer: 6
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 17 inches long and she cut off some inches of it, then her new length is 13 inches. To find out how many inches she cut off, we can subtract the original length from the new length: 13 - 17 = -4 inches. So, Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair.
"Response:  If she cut off 20 inches of hair before and now it is 10 inches long, then we can calculate the length of her original hair as follows:
Length of original hair = Current length of hair x (Original length / Current length)
= 10 inches x (20 inches / 10 inches)
= 40 inches
Therefore, she cut off 16 inches of hair before (20 - 10 = 16)."
"Response:  
Roby had 16 inches of hair originally. 
She cut off 11 inches, leaving her with 5 inches (16 - 11 = 5). 
Then she grew an additional 12 inches, bringing her total to 17 inches (5 + 12 = 17). 
So Roby's hair is currently 17 inches long."
Response:  If Robin's hair was originally 19 inches long, and then she added another 18 inches, her new length would be: 19 + 18 = 37 inches. So, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.
"Response:  If her hair was initially 14 inches long and now it is only 13 inches long after Robin cut off 1 inch, then we can calculate the difference between the initial length and the current length as follows:

Current length - Initial length = 13 - 14 = -1 inch
So, her hair is currently 1 inch shorter than its original length."
"Response:  
Firstly, Robbin's hair grew by 8 inches, so it became 14 + 8 = 22 inches long. 
Then she cut off 20 inches of her hair, leaving only 22 - 20 = 2 inches left. Therefore, Robbin's hair is currently 2 inches long."
Response:  Dan has 12 bottle caps in his collection initially. Then he finds 53 additional bottle caps in the park. So, now he has 12 + 53 = 65 bottle caps in total.
Response:  Dan has 21 bottle caps to start with and finds some more in the park. So he now has 53 - 21 = 32 bottle caps.
Response:  At first, Dan collected 63 bottle caps and threw away 51 old ones, so he had 33 new bottle caps left. Therefore, Dan initially had 63 - 51 = 12 bottle caps.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Dan collected 36 bottle caps and threw away 35 old ones. So he has 22 new bottle caps now. To find out how many more bottle caps he collected than he threw away, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he collected: 36 - 35 = 1. Therefore, he collected one more bottle cap than he threw away.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Dan collected 30 bottle caps in the park and threw away 63 old ones. So, he has 42 bottle caps now. To find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than he collected, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he collected from the total number of bottle caps he threw away: 63 - 30 = 33. Therefore, he threw away 33 more bottle caps than he collected.
Response:  At first, Danie had 22 bottle caps and no packaging paper. Then he found 8 pieces of packaging paper in the park. So now he has 22 + 8 = 30 bottle caps and 8 pieces of packaging paper. Later, he collected more bottle caps and packaging paper, so his total number increased to 28 bottle caps and 63 pieces of packaging paper. Therefore, at first, Danie had 30 bottle caps.
Response:  At first, Dan collected 30 packages of packaging paper and 22 bottle caps. So he had 30 + 22 = 52 items in his collection initially. Then, he found more bottle caps and package papers in the park, which increased his initial number to 17 + 57 = 74 items. Therefore, Dan initially had 52 packages of packaging paper.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 30 bottle caps and 14 pieces of packaging paper in the park initially. Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 pieces of packaging paper in his collection. So, we can calculate the number of bottle caps he found in the park as follows: Number of bottle caps found = Initial number of bottle caps - Number of bottle caps in the collection = 30 - 7 = 23 Therefore, Dan found 23 more bottle caps than packaging papers in the park.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 11 bottle caps and 28 pieces of packaging paper in the park initially. Now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 pieces of packaging paper in his collection. So, the number of packages more than bottles is equal to 51 - 68 = 17. Therefore, Dan found 17 more packages than bottles in the park.
"Response: 
Dan collected 71 bottle caps and 24 pieces of packaging paper in the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 pieces of packaging paper in his collection. So, the number of bottle caps Dan collected minus the number of bottle caps he currently has is equal to the number of pieces of packaging paper he currently has minus the number of pieces of packaging paper he had initially.
In other words, we can write an equation as follows:
Number of bottle caps collected - Number of bottle caps owned = Number of pieces of packaging paper owned - Number of pieces of packaging paper initially owned
Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
71 - x = 16 - y
Solving for x (the number of bottle caps Dan collected), we get:
x = 55
Therefore, Dan collected 55 bottle caps more than he currently owns."
Response:  Dan collected 10 bottle caps and 62 pieces of packaging paper initially. So, he had 10 + 62 = 72 items in his collection initially. Now, he found 27 more bottle caps and 43 more pieces of packaging paper. Therefore, he has 72 (initial) + 27 = 99 items in his collection now. Since he already had 62 pieces of packaging paper, he gained 43 - 62 = -29 pieces of packaging paper. So, he lost 29 pieces of packaging paper compared to the initial amount.
Response:  Dan collected 66 bottle caps in the park and then lost some of them. After that, he found 25 bottle caps. So, initially, Dan had 66 - 25 = 41 bottle caps.
Response:  Dan found 32 bottle caps in the park and he already had 25 before. So, the total number of bottle caps he has now is: 32 + 25 = 57.
Response:  At first, Danie had 60 old bottle caps. He found 58 new ones and threw away 60 old ones in the park. So he now has 67 bottle caps in total. Therefore, at first, Danie had 60 bottle caps.
Response:  Dan collected 6 old lids and found 50 new ones, so he has 6 + 50 = 56 lids in total. He threw away more than he found, so there are fewer lids left after throwing them away. So, the number of lids he threw away is equal to the difference between the total number of lids he had (56) and the number he found (50). Therefore, the number of lids he threw away is 56 - 50 = 6.
"Response: 
Dan collected 54 old lids and found 48 new ones. So he has 52 lids in total (54 - 48 = 6). He threw away more lids than he found. Therefore, the number of lids Dan threw away is equal to the difference between the number of lids he had initially and the number of lids he found: 6 - 48 = -42."
Response:  Dan collected 82 packages and 29 lids in the park. So initially he had x = 82 + 29 = 111 containers (lids) and bottle caps. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 packages, so his initial number of bottles was 111 - 42 = 70. Therefore, Dan initially had 70 bottles.
Response:  At first, Dan collected 39 packages and 66 lids. So he had 39 + 66 = 105 items in his collection initially. Then, he found more lids and packages in the park, which increased his initial number to 16 + 68 = 84 items. Therefore, Dan initially had 105 packages and lids.
Response:  Dan collected 46 bottle caps and 50 pieces of packaging paper in total initially. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 pieces of packaging paper in his collection. So, the number of bottle caps he found in the park is: 46 - 21 = 25 more than the number of packaging papers he found. Therefore, the number of bottle caps he found in the park is 25 more than the number of packaging papers he found.
Response:  We know that Dan collected 65 packages and 5 lids in total. Now he has 31 lids and 9 packages left. So, the number of packages he found in the park is 31 - 9 = 22 packages more than the number of lids he found. Therefore, the number of packages he found in the park is 22 packages more than the number of lids he found.
Response:  Dan collected 58 bottle caps and 25 pieces of packaging paper in total. Now he has 11 pieces of packaging paper and 12 bottle caps in his collection. So, the number of bottle caps he gained is 12 - 5 = 7 more than the number of packaging papers he gained, which is 11 + 25 = 36. Therefore, Dan gained 7 more bottle caps than packaging papers.
"Response: 
Dan collected 15 bottle caps and 18 pieces of packaging paper in the park. Now he has 67 packages of packaging paper and 35 bottle caps. So, the number of packages of packaging paper that Dan has is:
67 - 18 = 49
Therefore, Dan has 49 more packages of packaging paper than bottle caps."
Response:  Jack has 11 plums and Steve has 17 plums. So, if Jack has x plums, then Steve has 17 - x plums. We know that Jack has 11 plums, so we can write an equation as follows: 11 = 17 - x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation: 11 = -4x. Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by -4 to find the value of x: x = 28. Therefore, Steve has 28 plums.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has 7 apples and Steve has 15 apples. So, if we subtract the number of apples that Jack has from the total number of apples that Steve has, we get: 15 - 7 = 8. Therefore, Jack has 8 apples.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has 18 cherries and Steve has 19 cherries. So, if we subtract the number of cherries that Jack has from the total number of cherries possessed by both Jack and Steve, we get: 19 - 18 = 1. Therefore, Gil has 1 cherry.
Response:  Jack has 3 more mangoes than Steve. So, if Jack has x mangoes, then Steve has x - 3 mangoes. Since Steve has 5 mangoes in total, we can write the equation: x = 5 + (x - 3). Now, let's substitute the value of x from the problem statement: x = 10. Therefore, Jack has 10 more mangoes than Steve.
Response:  Jack has 12 - 4 = 8 mangoes more than Steve. So, Steve has 11 mangoes. Therefore, Gil has 11 + 4 = 15 mangoes more than Steve.
Response:  Jack has 7 more cherries than Steve, and Jack has 16 cherries in total. So, if Steve has x cherries, then Jack has x + 7 = 16 cherries. Therefore, Jack has 9 cherries.
Response:  Jack took 7 mangoes from Steve and gave them to Gil. So, Steve had 17 - 7 = 10 mangoes left. Now, Gil has 8 + 7 = 15 mangoes. Therefore, Gil has 15 mangoes.
Response:  Jack has 9 mangoes and more than Gildo who has 18 mangoes. So, Jack has more mangoes than Gildo. Therefore, the difference between the number of mangoes owned by Jack and Gildo is 9 - 18 = -9.
Response:  Jack has 6 mangoes and Steve has 18 mangoes. If Gil has 5 mangoes, then Jack has x mangoes. Since Steve has more mangoes than Jack, we can say that x < 18. So, Jack has 6 mangoes.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has 5 mangoes and Steve has 18 mangoes. If Gil has 87 mangoes, then Jack has more than 87 - 5 = 82 mangoes. So, Jack has 3 more mangoes than Steve. Therefore, the difference between Jack's number of mangoes and Steve's number of mangoes is 3.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has 16 mangoes and Steve has 15 mangoes. If Gil has 12 mangoes, then he has fewer mangoes than Steve. So, we can say that Gil is behind Steve in terms of number of mangoes. Therefore, the difference between the number of mangoes owned by Gil and Steve is equal to the number of mangoes owned by Steve minus the number of mangoes owned by Gil. In other words, the difference is 15 - 12 = 3. Hence, Gil is behind Steve by 3 mangoes.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has 12 more mangoes than Steve. So, if Steve has x mangoes, then Jack has 12 + x mangoes. Also, we know that Jack has 79 more apples than Steve. So, if Steve has y apples, then Jack has 79 - y apples. Now, let's substitute these values in the equation: 12 + x = 79 - y (1) Since Jack has 12 more mangoes than Steve, we can write: x = 12 + y (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: 12 + (12 + y) = 79 - y (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: 24 + y = 79 (4) Now, we have two equations and two variables. Solving for y, we get: y = 56 (5) Therefore, Jack has 56 mangoes.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has more apples than Steve. So, Jack has x apples and Steve has 9 + 8 = 17 apples. Since Jack has fewer mangoes than Steve, Jack has y mangoes, which means that Steve has (17 - y) mangoes. Now we can set up an equation based on this information: Jack has x + y = 13 (mangos), since Jack has 13 mangos in total. Subtracting y from both sides gives us x = 6, so Jack has 6 apples.
Response:  Jack has 6 mangoes and more than 8 apples. So he has 6 + x = 8 apples, where x is the number of mangoes Jack has. Since Jack has 17 mangoes in total, we can set up the equation: 6 + x = 17. Solving for x, we get: x = 11. Therefore, Jack has 11 more apples than mangoes.
Response:  Jack has 3 more apricots than Steve. So, if Steve has x apricots and y apples, then Jack has x + 3 apricots and y - 3 apples. We know that Jack has 12 apricots and 15 apples in total. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 3) = 12... (1) And also, y - 3 = 15... (2) Now, let's solve for x and y using these two equations simultaneously. Subtracting (1) from (2), we get: 2x = 18 Solving for x, we get: x = 9 So, Steve has 9 apricots and Jack has 12 apricots. To find out how many apples each of them have, we can use the information given in the question: Steve has 15 apples and Jack has 15 - 3 = 12 apples. Therefore, the difference between the number of apples that Steve has and the number of apples that Jack has is 12 - 12 = 0.
"Response:  We know that Steve has 12 balls and Jack has fewer than Steve. So, Jack has x balls. Since Jack is 4 less than Steve, we can write:
x = 12 - 4
Now, we know that Steve has more balls than Gil. So, we can write:
Gil has x + 67 balls
Subtracting x from both sides gives us:
Gil has 67 balls
Therefore, Jack has 8 balls (x = 8)."
"Response:  We know that Jack has more than Steve and less than Gil. So, we can say that Jack has x number of apricots. Since Steve has 18 apricots, we can write an equation as follows:
Steve + Jack = Gil (Since Steve is not equal to Gil)
Now, let's solve for Jack's apricot count using substitution or elimination method.
Using Substitution Method:
Let J be the number of apricots Jack has. Then, we can rewrite the above equation as:
Steve + J = Gil
Subtracting Steve from both sides gives us:
J = Gil - 18
Now, divide both sides by 2 to get the final answer:
Jack has 9 apricots.
Therefore, the correct answer is 9."
Response:  We know that Steve has 19 balls and Jack has fewer than Steve. So, Jack has at least 19 - 12 = 7 balls. Therefore, Jack has 7 balls.
Response:  We know that Jack has fewer mangoes than Steve. So, if Steve has x mangoes, then Jack has x - 6 mangoes. Also, we know that Jack has more mangoes than Gil. So, if Jack has x mangoes, then Gil has x / 3 mangoes. Now, let's find the value of x. Since Steve has 14 mangoes, we can write the equation: Steve + Jack = 14... (1) Now, substitute the values for Jack and solve for x: Jack = 14 - 6 = 8... (2) Substituting this value back into equation (1), we get: Steve + 8 = 14... (3) Solving for Steve, we get: Steve = 14 - 8 = 6... (4) Therefore, Gil has 6 mangoes.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Jack has more apples than Steve. So, Jack has 84 + x = 94 (where x is the number of apples that Steve has) apples. Now, we know that Steve has 13 cherries and 52 apples, so he has a total of 65 (13 + 52). Therefore, the difference between Jack's apple count and Steve's total fruit count is 84 - 65 = 19. So, Jack has 19 cherries.
Response:  Jack has more apples than Steve, so Jack has 13 + x = 40 (total number of fruits) - 17 = 23 apples. Therefore, Jack has 23 apples.
Response:  Jack has 8 apples and more than 10 pears. So he has at least 10 + 8 = 18 pears. Steve has 11 apples and 18 pears. Therefore, Steve has 11 - 18 = -7 pears less than Jack.
Response:  Jack has 3 mangoes and more than 4 apples. So he has 3 + x = 27 (total number of fruits) - 4 = 23 apples. Therefore, Jack has 3 mangoes more than 23 apples.
Response:  Oliva has $78 in her purse and she spent $15 at the supermarket. So, now she has $78 - $15 = $63 left in her purse.
Response:  If Oliva spent $78 at the supermarket and she still has $33 left, that means she initially had $78 + $33 = $111. So, her initial amount of money was $111.
"Response:  
Olivia has $100 in her wallet and withdraws $148 from an ATM machine. This means she now has $248 ($100 + $148). After buying groceries, she still has $159 left. Therefore, Olivia spent $99 ($248 - $159) at the supermarket."
"Response:  
1. Oliva has $3 in her wallet initially. 
2. She takes out $49 from an ATM machine. So now she has $46 ($3 + $49). 
3. After buying something at the supermarket, she still has $49 left. Therefore, the amount she spent at the supermarket is $49 - $46 = $3."
"Response:  
Olivia has $53 in her wallet and takes out $91 from an ATM machine. This means she now has $91 - $53 = $38 left in her wallet. After buying groceries, she still has $38. So, Olivia spent more than she had at first ($38 vs $53). Therefore, the difference between what she spent and what she had is $38 - $53 = -$15."
"Response: 
Olivia had $106 in her purse before she went to the mall.
After visiting the museum, she spent $49 there, leaving her with $57 ($106 - $49).
Then, she visited the store and spent $26 there, leaving her with $31 ($57 - $26).
Therefore, Olivia spent $26 at the store."
Response:  If Olivia spent $29 after shopping at the supermarket and she had initially $54 in her wallet, then we can calculate how much she spent as follows: Total amount = Initial money - Money spent = $54 - $29 = $25 So, Olivia spent $25 at the supermarket.
Response:  If Olivia spent $38 at the supermarket and initially had $128 in her wallet, then she has $90 left ($128 - $38 = $90).
Response:  Dave had 19 applications on his phone initially. He deleted 5 of them, so he has 19 - 5 = 14 applications left on his phone now. Therefore, there are 14 applications remaining on Dave's phone.
Response:  At first, David had 23 applications (18 - 5 = 23) on his phone.
Response:  Dave had 10 applications initially and added 11 new ones. So, he had 10 + 11 = 21 applications in total. Then, he deleted some of them, leaving him with 21 - x applications where x is the number of applications he deleted. Therefore, the answer is 21 - x.
"Response: 

Initially, David had 21 applications on his phone.
He added 89 new applications, so the total number of applications now is:
21 + 89 = 106

Now, he deleted some applications, leaving him with 24 applications. So, the difference between the number of applications he added and the number he deleted is:
106 - 24 = 82

Therefore, David added more than twice as many applications as he deleted."
Response:  Dave had initially 15 applications on his phone. Then he added 71 new applications. So, in total, he has 86 applications (15 + 71). Now, let's find out how many applications he deleted. The question states that after deleting some, he still had 14 applications left. Therefore, the number of applications he deleted is equal to the number of applications he had after deleting some - 14 = x. Since we know that the sum of the initial and added applications is 86, we can write an equation: 15 + 71 = 86. Solving for x, we get: x = 32. So, Dave deleted 32 applications from his phone.
"Response:  We know that David had 16 applications and 77 files initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 applications and 23 files. To find out how many applications David deleted, we can subtract the number of applications he had after deleting from the initial number of applications. So, the number of applications David deleted is:

16 - 5 = 11

Therefore, David deleted 11 applications."
"Response:  
David initially had 21 files and 17 applications. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with only 3 apps and 7 files. So, to find out how many files David deleted, we can subtract the number of files he has now (7) from the initial number of files he had (21):

21 - 7 = 14

Therefore, David deleted 14 files."
"Response: 

Initially, David had 15 applications and 24 files on his phone. (Given)
After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 21 applications and 4 files. (Given)
So, initially, the number of applications was greater than the number of files by 3 (15 - 24 = -9).
Now, after deleting some applications and files, the number of applications is lesser than the number of files by 7 (21 - 4 = 17).
Therefore, the difference between the number of applications and the number of files after deletion is 7 (17 - 4 = 13)."
"Response: 

Initially, David had 19 applications and 18 files on his phone. (Given)

After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 6 applications and 15 files. (Given)

So, initially, the number of files was greater than the number of applications by 18 - 19 = 9.

Therefore, the number of remaining files after deleting some applications is 15 - 9 = 6."
"Response:  
David initially had 17 applications on his phone. He added some more and now has 18 applications in total. So, he added 1 application to his initial number of 17 applications. Therefore, David added 1 application."
"Response:  
David initially had 15 applications and 59 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he was left with 12 apps and 30 files. So, David deleted 3 applications (15 - 12 = 3)."
"Response:  
David had 24 files and 13 applications initially. After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 17 applications and 21 files. So, David deleted 7 files (24 - 17 = 7)."
"Response: 

Initially, David had 24 applications and 9 files on his phone. (Given)
After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 5 files and 12 applications. (Given)
So, initially, the number of applications exceeded the number of files by 12 - 5 = 7.
Therefore, the number of applications remaining on David's phone after deleting some is 12 - 7 = 5 more than the number of files."
"Response: 

Initially, David had 11 applications and 3 files on his phone. (Given)
After deleting some applications and files, he was left with 24 files and 2 applications. (Given)
So, initially, the number of files was 11 + 3 = 14, and the number of applications was 11.
Now, after deleting some files and applications, the number of remaining files is 24, and the number of remaining applications is 2.
Therefore, the difference between the initial number of files and the final number of files is 24 - 14 = 10.
Similarly, the difference between the initial number of applications and the final number of applications is 2 - 11 = -9.
So, there are 10 more files than applications on David's phone after deleting some apps and files."
Response:  We know that Nell has 242 baseball cards in total. She gave Jeff 136 of them, so she still has... (242 - 136 = 106) baseball cards left. Therefore, Nell has 106 baseball cards left.
"Response:  
Initially, Nell had 301 cards (given). 
She gave Jeff 301 - 154 = 147 cards (given). 
So initially, Nell had 147 cards."
Response:  We know that Nell has 528 baseball cards and Jeff only has 11. So, she gave him some of her cards. Now, she has 252 cards left. To find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff, we can divide the number of cards she had left (252) by the number of cards he had (11). So, Nell gave Jeff 23 cards (252 / 11 = 23).
Response:  We know that Nell has 566 cards initially and gives some to Jeff. So, after giving some to Jeff, she still has 535 cards left. Now, we need to find out how many cards Jeff gets from Nell. Since Jeff has 234 cards initially, he will get (535 - 234) = 301 additional cards from Nell. Therefore, Jeff now has 234 + 301 = 535 cards in total.
Response:  We know that Nell had 309 baseball cards and 356 ten-card packs initially. She gave some of them to Jeff, so she has fewer cards now. Let's assume she gave him 100 baseball cards (since there are 100 - 309 = 201 remaining) and 50 ten-card packs (since there are 356 - 306 = 50 remaining). Now, let's calculate how many baseball cards Nell has left: 415 - 201 = 214 baseball cards. And for ten-card packs, we have 149 - 50 = 99 remaining. So, Nell has 214 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.
Response:  We know that Nell had 246 baseball cards and 214 ten-card packs initially. She gave some of them to Jeff, so she has fewer cards now. Let's assume she gave him 10 baseball cards and 3 ten-card packs (since each pack contains 10 cards). So, after giving these to Jeff, Nell has 236 baseball cards and 187 ten-card packs left. Now, we need to find out how many more ten-card packs Nell has than baseball cards. To do this, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of cards she has: 495 - 187 = 308. Therefore, Nell has 308 more ten-card packs than baseball cards.
Response:  We know that Nell gave John 195 cards and some to Jeff. So, the total number of cards she gave away is 195 + (some) = x. Now, we are told that she has 573 cards in total and has given away x cards. Therefore, the number of cards she has left is 573 - x = 210. So, the number of cards she gave to Jeff is x = 210.
Response:  We know that Nell has 438 baseball cards and 18 ten-card packs. She gave some of them to Jeff, so now she has 55 ten-card packs and 178 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of cards she had: 178 - 55 = 123. So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.
Response:  We know that Nell has 239 baseball cards and 38 ten-card packs. She gave some of them to Jeff, so she now has 376 ten-card packs and 111 baseball cards left. To find out how many more baseball cards Nell has than ten-card packs, we can subtract the number of ten-card packs from the total number of cards she had: 239 - 38 = 201. So, Nell has 201 more baseball cards than ten-card packs.
Response:  Paco had 44 pieces of bread (19 + 25). So initially he had 44 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Paco has 28 pieces of bread and he eats some, then there are fewer pieces left. We can assume that Paco ate half of his bread (14 pieces). So, now Paco has 14 pieces of bread left. Therefore, Paco ate 14 pieces of bread.
Response:  Paco had 40 pieces of bread initially and he ate 2 pieces. So, he has 40 - 2 = 38 pieces left. Then, he bought 37 more pieces of bread. So, in total, Paco has 38 + 37 = 75 pieces of bread now.
Response:  The boy had 25 pieces of bread initially. He ate 5 pieces, so he has 25 - 5 = 20 pieces left. Then, he bought 3 more pieces, so he now has 20 + 3 = 23 pieces in total. Therefore, the boy ate more than he bought.
Response:  The boy had 13 pieces of bread initially and he ate 2 pieces. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 pieces left. Then, he bought 36 more pieces of bread. So, in total, he has 11 + 36 = 47 pieces of bread now.
Response:  Paco has 40 pieces of bread and eats 5 pieces. So he has 40 - 5 = 35 pieces left.
Response:  Paco has 17 pieces of bread and eats 14 pieces. So he has 17 - 14 = 3 remaining pieces of bread. He gives his friend 13 pieces of bread, so now Paco has 3 + 13 = 16 pieces of bread left. Therefore, Paco ate more than he gave to his friend by 3 - 13 = -10 pieces of bread.
Response:  Paco has 12 pieces of breadcrumbs and eats 16 pieces. So he has 12 - 16 = -4 pieces left. Then, he gives his friend 21 pieces of breadcrumbs, so his friend has 21 + (-4) = 17 pieces of breadcrumbs. Therefore, the difference between the number of pieces Paco gave to his friend and the number he had is 17 - 12 = 5 pieces.
Response:  We know that Paco has 22 pieces of sweet bread and 75 pieces of salty bread initially. He eats 15 pieces of sweet bread and 54 pieces of salty bread. So, he has left behind 22 - 15 = 6 pieces of sweet bread and 75 - 54 = 21 pieces of salty bread. Therefore, Paco still has 6 pieces of sweet bread.
Response:  Paco has 9 pieces of sweet bread and 6 pieces of savory bread. He eats 36 pieces of sweet bread and 3 pieces of savory bread. So far, he has eaten a total of 45 pieces of bread (9 + 6 = 15). This means that he still has 27 pieces of bread left (36 - 45 = 27). Therefore, Paco still has 27 pieces of savory bread left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 37 pieces of sweet bread and 11 pieces of salty bread. He ate 5 pieces of sweet bread and 2 pieces of salty bread. So, we have to find out how many pieces of sweet bread he left after eating them. To do this, we need to subtract the number of pieces of sweet bread he ate from the total number of pieces of sweet bread he had. Therefore, the number of pieces of sweet bread he left is: 37 - 5 = 32 pieces of sweet bread. Now, let's compare it with the number of pieces of salty bread he had. He had 11 pieces of salty bread, and he ate 2 pieces of salty bread. So, the number of pieces of salty bread he left is: 11 - 2 = 9 pieces of salty bread. Finally, we can say that the number of pieces of sweet bread Paco has compared to the number of pieces of salty bread he has is: 32 (pieces of sweet bread) / 9 (pieces of salty bread) = 3.5 times more sweet bread than salty bread.
Response:  Paco has 8 pieces of sweet bread and 6 pieces of salty bread. He ate 20 pieces of sweet bread and 34 pieces of salty bread. So, he ate a total of 20 + 34 = 54 pieces of bread. Since he had 8 pieces of sweet bread initially, that means he ate 54 - 8 = 46 pieces of salty bread. Therefore, he ate more salty bread than sweet bread.
Response:  If Paco had initially 37 pieces of bread and he ate 36 pieces, then he has left 1 piece of bread. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Paco has 36 pieces of bread. He gives his friend 14 pieces, leaving him with 22 pieces (36 - 14 = 22). Then he eats 10 pieces himself, leaving him with 12 pieces (22 - 10 = 12). So, Paco still has 12 pieces of bread left.
Response:  If Paco has 41 pieces of bread and gives 9 to his friends, then he has 41 - 9 = 32 pieces of bread left. He eats 18 pieces of bread himself, so there are 32 - 18 = 14 pieces of bread left after he eats them. Therefore, the number of pieces of bread that Paco has left is 14.
Response:  Paco has 6 pieces of bread, and he gives his friends 30 pieces. So, Paco has 6 - 30 = -24 pieces of bread left. He eats 23 pieces himself, so now he has -24 + 23 = 9 pieces of bread left. Therefore, the number of pieces of bread that Paco gave to his friend is 30 - 9 = 21 pieces.
Response:  We know that Paco has 97 pieces of salted crackers and 34 pieces of sweet crackers initially. He eats 15 pieces of sweet crackers and 56 pieces of salted crackers. So, he has left behind 34 - 15 = 19 pieces of sweet crackers. Therefore, Paco still has 19 pieces of sweet crackers left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 26 pieces of salted crackers and 17 pieces of sweet crackers initially. He eats 14 pieces of sweet crackers and 9 pieces of salty crackers. So, he has left with how many pieces of each type? To find out, we can use the following equation: Total number of pieces = Initial number of pieces - Number eaten. For sweet crackers, this is: Total number of sweet crackers = 17 - 14 = 3. And for salty crackers, this is: Total number of salty crackers = 26 - 9 = 17. Therefore, Paco has 3 pieces of sweet crackers and 17 pieces of salty crackers left.
Response:  We know that Paco has 39 pieces of sweet bread and 6 pieces of salty bread. He ate 23 pieces of salty bread and 32 pieces of sweet bread. So, he ate more sweet bread than salty bread. To find out how many more sweet bread he ate, we can subtract the number of salty bread he ate from the total number of sweet bread he had: 39 - 23 = 16. Therefore, Paco ate 16 more pieces of sweet bread than salty bread.
Response:  We know that Paco has 40 pieces of sweet bread and 25 pieces of salty bread initially. He eats 28 pieces of salty bread and 15 pieces of sweet bread. So, the total number of salty bread he eats is 28 + 15 = 43 pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces of salty bread he has left after eating is 25 - 43 = -18 pieces. Since negative numbers are not possible in this case, we can conclude that Paco has 25 pieces of salty bread left after eating.
Response:  We know that Gwen received $7 and spent some money, leaving her with $5. So, we can write an equation as follows: $7 - x = 5 where x is the amount of money Gwen spent. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by $7: x / 7 = 5 / 7. Simplifying, we get x = 2. Therefore, Gwen spent $2.
Response:  If she received $X dollars and spent $8, then she has $X - $8 = $6 left. So, the amount of money she received is $6.
Response:  Gwen received $2 from her mom and her dad gave her $4, so she has a total of $6. If she spent $3, then she has $3 left. Therefore, the answer is $3.
Response:  Gwen received $8 from her mom and $5 from her dad, so she has a total of $13. If she spent $4, then she received $9 more than what she spent ($13 - $4 = $9). Therefore, Gwen received $9 more from her mom than from her dad.
Response:  Gwen received $3 from her mom and $6 from her dad, so she got a total of $9 ($3 + $6). If she spent $4, then she has $5 left ($9 - $4 = $5). So, she received more money from her dad than from her mom. The difference is $5 ($5 = $9 - $4).
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her father and $7 from her mother, so she has a total of $12.
If she spent $4, then the amount she received from her mother is:
$7 - $4 = $3
So, Gwen's mother gave her more money than her father did. The difference between the two amounts is $3."
"Response: 
Gwen received $5 from her father and $2 from her mother, so she got a total of $7.
If she spent $6, then she received $1 more than what she spent ($7 - $6 = $1).
Therefore, Gwen received $1 more than what she spent from her father than from her mother."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Joey initially had 9 marbles in his collection and then lost some of them. We are not told how many he lost, but we know that after losing some, he only has 4 left now. So, if Joey initially had 9 marbles and lost x of them, then he must have 9 - x marbles left. Since he only has 4 marbles left now, we can set up the equation: 9 - x = 4. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. Therefore, Joey lost 5 marbles.
Response:  We know that Joey has lost 21 marbles and now he has 12 marbles. So, if he had originaly X marbles, we can write an equation: X - 21 = 12. Now solve for X.
Response:  At first, Joey had 19 marbles in his collection. Then he lost 11 marbles, so he had 19 - 11 = 8 marbles left. Later, he found 5 new marbles, so now he has 8 + 5 = 13 marbles in total. Therefore, Joey currently has 13 marbles in his collection.
"Response: 

Joy has 4 marbles in his collection initially.
He lost 16 marbles, so he had 4 - 16 = -12 marbles.
Then, he found 8 new marbles, so he had -12 + 8 = 6 marbles.
Therefore, Joy lost more marbles than he found, so the difference between the number of marbles he lost and the number he found is 16 - 8 = 8 marbles."
"Response: 

Joy has 7 marbles in his collection initially.
He loses 8 marbles, so he has 7 - 8 = -1 marble left. (Note: The sign is important here as it indicates that Joy has fewer marbles now than he had initially.)
Then, he finds 10 new marbles, so he has -1 + 10 = 9 marbles now.
Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles Joy found and the number he lost is 9 - 8 = 1."
Response:  We know that Jo has collected 21 marbles initially and then he found 7 more marbles. So, in total, Jo now has 21 + 7 = 28 marbles.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Joey has 20 marbles in his collection and gives 2 marbles to Jack. So initially, Joey had 20 - 2 = 18 marbles. Now, he still has 18 marbles left. Therefore, the answer is 18.
"Response:  
Jake gave Joey 20 bullets. So, Joey has 20 + 22 = 42 bullets in total."
Response:  If Joey had 19 marbles initially and lost 11 of them, he now has 8 marbles left (19 - 11 = 8). So, there are 8 marbles left with Joey.
"Response:  
Joy has 22 marbles in his collection initially. 
He finds 13 of them and loses 5 of them. So, he now has 13 - 5 = 8 marbles left. 
Therefore, Joy still has 8 marbles in his collection."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Joey has collected 15 marbles and then found 9 of them. So he has lost 6 marbles (15 - 9 = 6). Now, we are asked how many marbles Joey lost compared to the ones he found. To find this difference, we subtract the number of marbles he found from the total number of marbles he had at first: 6 (lost) = 9 (found) - 15 (total). Therefore, Joey lost 9 - 15 = -7 marbles.
"Response: 

Joy has 3 marbles in his collection initially.
He finds 6 more marbles, so now he has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles.
However, he loses 5 marbles, so now he has 9 - 5 = 4 marbles left.
Therefore, Joy has 4 more marbles than he had initially."
Response:  The total weight of the grasshoppers and their father is 4 pounds, so the weight of each grasshopper is 4/2 = 2 pounds. Since Marco's grasshopper weighs 19 pounds, his grasshopper is heavier than his father's by 19 - 2 = 17 pounds.
"Response:  We know that Mao and his father together picked 35 pounds of strawberries. Mao picked 13 pounds of strawberries himself. So, we can calculate the weight of his father's strawberries as follows: 
Father's strawberry weight = Total weight of strawberries - Mao's strawberry weight
= 35 pounds - 13 pounds
= 22 pounds
Therefore, Mao's father's strawberries are heavier than Mao's by 9 pounds (i.e., 22 pounds - 13 pounds)."
"Response:  We know that the total weight of the strawberries is 20 pounds and Marco's father's share is 17 pounds. So, we can calculate Marco's share as follows:
Marco's share = Total weight - Father's share
= 20 lb - 17 lb
= 3 lb
Therefore, Marco's strawberries are 3 pounds heavier than his father's."
"Response: 
Ma Kai and his father together picked 40 pounds of strawberries (8 pounds from Ma Kai + 32 pounds from his father)."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Mao and his father together collected 24 pounds of strawberries. Then, during their journey back home, Mao lost 9 pounds of strawberries, so he now has 3 pounds left. Therefore, his father must have had 21 pounds (24 - 9 = 21) of strawberries."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Mao and his father together collected 36 pounds of strawberries. Then, on their way back home, Mao's father lost 8 pounds of strawberries, so now Mao has 12 pounds of strawberries (36 - 8 = 12).
Now, to find out how much strawberries Mao's father has left, we need to subtract the weight of strawberries he lost from the total amount they initially collected: 36 pounds - 8 pounds = 28 pounds.
Therefore, Mao's father currently has 28 pounds of strawberries."
"Response: 
Firstly, Ma Chao and his father together collected 22 pounds of strawberries. Then, Ma Chao's father found additional 30 pounds of strawberries on their way back. So, in total, Ma Chao has 36 pounds of strawberries now.
To find out how much more weight Ma Chao's father found, we need to subtract the original amount from the current total weight of strawberries. Therefore, the answer is:
Weight of additional strawberries = Current total weight of strawberries - Original amount
= 36 pounds - 22 pounds
= 14 pounds
Therefore, Ma Chao's father found an additional 14 pounds of strawberries."
Response:  If Mao and his father together have 37 pounds of strawberries, and Mao's share is 15 pounds, then his father's share must be 22 pounds (37 - 15 = 22).
Response:  If Mao and his father together weigh 17 pounds of strawberries, then Mao's weight is 17 / 2 = 8.5 pounds. So, Mao's strawberry is heavier than his father's by 8.5 - 8 = 0.5 pounds.
Response:  If Mao and his father together have 26 pounds of strawberries, and Mao's share is 10 pounds, then his father must have 16 pounds (26 - 10 = 16).
Response:  If Mao and his father together have 30 pounds of strawberries, and Mao's share is 11 pounds, then his father's share must be 19 pounds (30 - 11 = 19).
Response:  At first, there were 2 children in the bus. Then, some more children got on the bus at the station, making the total number of children on the bus 10. So, the difference between the number of children at the station and the current number is equal to the initial number of children plus the additional number that got on at the station. Therefore, the answer is: 2 + (10 - 2) = 14 children.
Response:  The initial number of children is 26. Then, another 38 children get on the bus at the station. So, the total number of children now on the bus = Initial number + Newly added children = 26 + 38 = 64. Therefore, there are 64 children on the bus now.
Response:  At first, there were some children in the bus. Then, two more children got on the bus at the station. So, initially, there were 2 + 2 = 4 children in the bus. Later, 40 more children boarded the bus at the station. Therefore, the total number of children in the bus at any point before reaching the station is 4.
Response:  At first, there are 43 children in the bus. Then, some of them get off at the station, so the number of children left on the bus is 21. To find out how many children got off at the station, we can divide the number of children left on the bus by the original number of children in the bus: 21 / 43 = x. Therefore, x children got off at the station.
Response:  At first, there were 41 children in the bus. Then, some of them got off the bus, leaving 18 children still on it. So, before they arrived at the bus station, there were more than 18 children on the bus (since some got off). Therefore, the answer is 41 - 18 = 23.
Response:  At first, there were 21 children in the bus. Then, 10 of them got off at the station, leaving 11 children still on the bus. Finally, 4 more children boarded the bus at the station, making the total number of children on the bus 16. So, the number of children who got off at the station is 10 - 11 = -1.
Response:  We know that there are 5 children initially sitting in the bus. Then, 63 children get off at the station, leaving 98 children still on the bus (including the initial 5). Finally, 14 children get on the bus at the station, bringing the total number of children on the bus to 112. So, the difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is 112 - 63 = 50. Therefore, 50 more children got on the bus than got off.
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that there are 36 children in total who boarded the bus and then got off at the station with 68 children. So, the total number of children = 36 + 68 = 104.
Step 2: Now, we know that 12 children remained on the bus after it left the station. So, the number of children who got off the bus = 104 - 12 = 92.
Step 3: To find out how many more children got off the bus than boarded it, we need to subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who boarded it: Number of children who got off > Number of children who boarded it (92 > 36)
So, the answer is 56."
Response:  We know that there are initially 22 children in the bus and then 40 children get off at the station. So, the total number of children in the bus is 22 + 40 = 62. Now, some children get off the bus, leaving only 2 children behind. Therefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 62 - 2 = 60.
"Response: 
Step 1: There are 28 children in the bus initially.
Step 2: 82 children get on the bus at the station.
Step 3: Some children get off the bus. (We don't know how many.)
Step 4: The total number of children on the bus is 30.
Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of children who got on and the number of children who got off:
Number of children who got on - Number of children who got off = 82 - x
Where x is the unknown number of children who got off the bus.
Since there are 30 children on the bus, we can set up the equation:
82 - x = 30
Solving for x, we get:
x = 52
So, 52 children got off the bus.
Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus compared to the number of children who got off is 82 - 52 = 30."
"Response: 
1. There are 23 children who boarded the bus at the station. (Given)
2. After some children got off the bus, there were 24 children on the bus. (Given)
3. Then, 8 children got off the bus. (Given)
Now we have to find out how many children got off the bus compared to those who boarded it. So, let's subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children who boarded the bus:
Number of children who got off = 8
Total number of children who boarded the bus = 23
So, the difference between the number of children who got off and the total number of children who boarded the bus is:
Difference = Number of children who got off - Total number of children who boarded the bus
= 8 - 23
= -15
Therefore, 15 children got off the bus compared to the ones who boarded it."
Response:  If he sold 51 of them, then the number of remaining bread = Total bread - Number of sold bread = 133 - 51 = 82. So, he made more than 82 bread after selling 51.
Response:  The baker initially made 54 pieces of bread (蛋糕). He sold some of them and now has 13 left ( remaining ). So, he sold x pieces of bread, where x is the number of pieces he sold. We know that x is less than or equal to 54, since he still has some bread left. Therefore, we can write the equation: x ≤ 54. Now, we want to find out how many pieces of bread the baker actually sold. To do this, we divide both sides of the inequality by 2 : x = 27. So, the baker sold 27 pieces of bread.
"Response:  If he sold 145 pieces of cake and has 72 left, then he initially made 
$$ = \text { Initial number of cakes } - \text{ Number of cakes sold} $$
= $ = 145 - 145$
= $0$
Therefore, he initially made $0$ cakes."
"Response:  If the baker made 155 pieces of cake and his friend bought 140 pieces, then the baker still has how many pieces left?
Let X be the number of remaining pieces of cake. We know that X + 140 = 155 (total number of cakes sold). Solving for X, we get:
X = 15 - 140 = -125
So, the baker still has 125 pieces of cake left."
Response:  The baker initially made 121 pieces of bread and sold 105 of them, leaving him with 16 (121 - 105) remaining. Then he bought new bread to sell, which is equal to 170 pieces. So now the baker has 36 (16 + 170) pieces of bread left.
Response:  The baker bought 154 new cakes and sold 91 old ones. So, he has 63 (154 - 91) more cakes than he sold. Therefore, he bought 63 + 91 = 154 cakes.
Response:  The baker made 170 pieces of bread and sold 78 of them. So he has 92 remaining (170 - 78 = 92). Then, he bought 31 new pieces of bread. So now he has 92 + 31 = 123 pieces of bread in total.
Response:  The baker made 110 pieces of bread and sold 75 of them. So he has 35 remaining (110 - 75 = 35). Then, he made another 76 pieces of bread, so now he has 35 + 76 = 111 pieces of bread left.
Response:  The baker made 144 pieces of bread and sold 71 of them. Then he made another 111 pieces of bread. So in total, the baker has made 255 pieces of bread (144 + 111). Therefore, the number of more bread the baker has made than the ones he sold is 255 - 71 = 184.
"Response:  The baker made 149 pies and 91 cakes. If he sold 10 pies and 90 cakes, then the number of remaining pies is:

Remaining pies = Original pies - Sold pies
= 149 - 10
= 139

So, the baker still has 139 pies left."
Response:  The baker made 7 eggs and 148 points of cake. If he sold 15 eggs and 103 points of cake, how many points of cake does the baker have left? So, the baker has 148 - (15 + 103) = 148 - 128 = 20 points of cake left.
Response:  The baker made 126 pieces of cake and 48 pieces of pastry. If he sold 115 pieces of cake and 81 pieces of pastry, then he must have had more than 81 pieces of pastry at first. So, the number of extra pieces of pastry is equal to the difference between the total number of pieces of pastry (126) and the number of pieces of pastry he sold (81). Therefore, the baker has 45 extra pieces of pastry.
Response:  The baker made 19 pies and 131 cakes. If he sold 70 pies and 88 cakes, then he has left with how many pies? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of pies = Original number of pies + Sold pies - Number of pies sold = 19 + 70 - 4 = 56 pies So, the baker has 56 pies left after selling 70 pies. Now, let's find out how many more cakes he has than before: Total number of cakes = Original number of cakes + Sold cakes - Number of cakes sold = 131 + 88 - 4 = 125 cakes So, the baker has 125 cakes left after selling 88 cakes. Therefore, the baker has 37 more cakes than pies (125 cakes - 56 pies).
"Response:  If he sold 158 bread rolls and 147 cakes, then the number of bread rolls he sold is:

158 - 169 = -11 (negative because we are subtracting the total number of cakes from the total number of bread rolls)

So, there were 11 more bread rolls sold than cakes."
"Response:  The baker made 54 eggs and 143 cakes. If he sold 68 eggs and 92 cakes, then the number of cakes he sold is:

$$ \text{Number of cakes sold} = \text{Total number of cakes} - \text{Number of cakes sold} $$
= $143 - (68 + 92)$
= $143 - 150$
= $-7$
Therefore, the number of cakes sold is $7$."
"Response:  If he initially made 48 pieces of bread and sold 44, then he still has how many?
Step-by-step calculation:
Initially, he had 48 pieces of bread.
Sold 44 pieces.
So, he has 48 - 44 = 14 pieces left."
Response:  If he initially made 40 pieces of bread and sold 8, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 left. So, he has more than he sold. The difference is 32 - 8 = 24.
"Response:  If Becker initially made 169 cakes and his friend bought 137 of them, then Becker must have had some left over. We can find out how many cakes he had left by subtracting the number that his friend bought from the total number he made:

169 - 137 = 32

So, Becker had 32 cakes left over after his friend bought 137."
Response:  The baker made 173 bread rolls and sold 86 of them, leaving him with 87 remaining bread rolls (173 - 86 = 87).
Response:  The baker bought 167 new bread rolls and sold 89 of them, so he has 78 left (167 - 89 = 78). Now we know that the baker made 99 bread rolls in total, but he sold some of them. So, the number of bread rolls the baker has left is equal to the number he made minus the number he sold, which is 99 - 89 = 10. Therefore, the baker has 10 extra bread rolls compared to the ones he originally made.
Response:  The baker bought 139 eggs and sold 145 eggs. So he gained 6 eggs (145 - 139 = 6). Therefore, the baker sold more eggs than he bought.
Response:  The baker made 62 eggs and then he made another 149 eggs. So in total, he made 62 + 149 = 211 eggs. Since he sold 144 eggs, he has 211 - 144 = 67 eggs left.
Response:  The baker made 81 eggs and then made another 92 eggs. So in total, he made 81 + 92 = 173 eggs. He sold 46 of them. Therefore, the number of eggs that the baker made more than he sold is: 173 - 46 = 127 eggs.
"Response:  The baker made 61 pieces of bread and 167 cakes. If he sold 108 cakes and 44 pieces of bread, then... (1)
The number of cakes left with the baker is equal to the total number of cakes minus the number of cakes sold. So, we can write: (2)
Number of cakes left = Total number of cakes - Number of cakes sold
= 167 - 108
= 59
Therefore, the baker has 59 cakes left."
Response:  The baker made 56 bread rolls and 124 cakes. If he sold 104 cakes and 29 bread rolls, then... (104 + 29) = 133 items were sold in total. So, the number of bread rolls left with the baker is: 56 - 29 = 27 bread rolls.
Response:  If he sold 102 pieces of cake and 94 pieces of bread, then he made more than 94 + 102 = 196 total pastries. So, he made more bread than cakes. The ratio of bread to cakes is 84:52 or 3:2. Therefore, for every two pieces of bread, there are three pieces of cakes.
"Response:  The baker made 134 pieces of bread and 11 cakes initially. If he sold 140 cakes and 92 pieces of bread, then the number of additional bread pieces he sold is:
Additional bread pieces = Sold bread pieces - Initially made bread pieces = 140 - 134 = 6
So, the baker sold 6 more bread pieces than he initially made."
Response:  The baker had initially made 14 pies and 153 muffins. If he sold 8 pies and 97 muffins, then the number of pies he has left is 14 - 8 = 6, and the number of muffins he has left is 153 - 97 = 56. So, the number of muffins the baker sold is 97, and the number of pies he sold is 8. Therefore, the number of muffins the baker sold is greater than the number of pies he sold by 97 - 8 = 89.
"Response:  The baker made 43 eggs and 114 cakes. If he sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes, then the number of pastries he sold is:

154 - 43 = 111

So, the number of cakes the baker sold is:

78 - 11 = 67

Therefore, the number of pastries the baker sold is 111, and the number of cakes he sold is 67."
"Response:  If Kaili has 22 Nintendo games and needs to buy more to have 140 in total, we can calculate it as follows:

Total number of games = 22 + (number of additional games needed)
Number of additional games needed = Total number of games - 140
= 22 - 140
= -118
Therefore, Kaili needs to buy 118 more Nintendo games to have 140 in total."
Response:  If Kaitlyn has 106 Nintendo games and sends out 64 of them, then she has 106 - 64 = 42 remaining games.
Response:  If Kaitlyn sent out 91 Nintendo games and now has 92 left, that means she initially had 91 + 92 = 183 games. Therefore, the answer is 183.
Response:  Kari has 20 Nintendo games and 70 Sony games. To find out how many Nintendo games she needs to send away to have 12 left, we can divide the number of Nintendo games she has (20) by the number of Sony games she has (70). This gives us a ratio of 20/70 = 0.286 or approximately 29%. So, Kari needs to send away approximately 29% of her Nintendo games (i.e., 5 games) to have 12 left.
Response:  Kari has 132 Sony games and wants to send away 31 of them. So, she needs to send away 31 - 132 = -101 Sony games.
Response:  If Kaitlyn has 80 Nintendo games and she found 31 of them, then she must have sent away 49 games (80 - 31 = 49). To find out how many games she needs to send away to have 6 left, we can divide 49 by 7 (since there are 7 games in each group): 49 / 7 = 7. So, Kaitlyn needs to send away 7 games to have 6 left.
Response:  If he used 52 blocks to build the tower and there are still 38 blocks left, then initially he had 52 + 38 = 90 blocks of Lego bricks.
Response:  If Lindi has 97 blocks and he uses some of them to build a tower, then there are less than 97 blocks left after building the tower. We can assume that the number of blocks used for the tower is x. Therefore, we have: 97 - x = 72 (blocks left) Now, we need to find out how many blocks Lindi used to build the tower. So, we divide both sides of the equation by x: x = 97 / 72 = 13 (blocks per tower) Therefore, Lindi used 13 blocks to build each tower.
Response:  兰迪 has 79 blocks in total. He used 14 blocks to build a tower and 11 blocks to build a house, so he has 79 - (14 + 11) = 54 blocks left. Therefore, there are 54 blocks left after building the tower and the house.
Response:  Ludi has 58 blocks and he uses 27 of them to build a tower. So, he has 31 blocks left. He then uses 53 of these remaining blocks to build a house. Therefore, in total, Ludi used 31 + 53 = 84 blocks to build both the tower and the house.
Response:  Ludi has 37 blocks and he uses 33 of them to build a tower. So, he has 4 blocks left over from building the tower. Now, he uses these 4 blocks to build a house. Therefore, the number of blocks used to build the house is equal to the number of blocks left over after building the tower, which is 4. So, the answer is 4.
Response:  The boy has 86 blocks and he uses 79 of them to build a tower. So, he has 8 - 79 = 8 blocks left over. Now, he uses these 8 blocks to build a house. Since he needs 82 blocks to build the house, we can say that the number of blocks used for building the house is equal to the number of blocks left over after building the tower, i.e., 8 blocks. Therefore, the difference between the number of blocks used for building the house and the number of blocks used for building the tower is 8 - 79 = -71 blocks.
Response:  If Ludi used 36 blocks to build a tower, and he has 59 blocks in total, then he must have used all of them up. So, there are no remaining blocks. Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Lingdi has 95 blocks and he used 20 of them to build a house. So, the number of blocks left for building a tower is 95 - 20 = 75. Now, we know that Lingdi built a tower using 50 of these remaining blocks. Therefore, the number of blocks used to build the tower is 50.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Lingdi has 90 blocks and he uses 89 of them to build a house. So, there are 1 block left over after building the house. Now, he uses 63 blocks to build a tower. Since he already used 89 blocks for the house, he can only use 74 blocks (63 - 89 = 74) to build the tower. Therefore, the number of blocks that Lingdi used to build the house is 1 more than the number of blocks he used to build the tower. Answer: 1
Response:  If there are 20 books in the series and you have read 5 of them, then you have not read any other book except for those 5. Therefore, the number of books you have read is equal to 5.
"Response:  We know that the person has already read 13 books and there are 8 more books left to be read in the series. So, the total number of books in the series is:

13 + 8 = 21

Therefore, the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series consists of 21 books in total."
Response:  If there are 22 books in the series and you have already read 12 of them, then you still need to read 9 more books (22 - 12 = 9).
"Response:  If there are 4 books and 17 movies in the series, that means we have a total of 4 x 17 = 68 items in the series.
If you read 19 books and watched 7 movies, then you still need to watch 68 - 7 = 61 more movies. Therefore, the answer is 61."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 16 books and 14 movies in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series. If you have read 19 books and watched 13 movies, then we can calculate the number of books that are more than movies as follows: Number of books - Number of movies = (19 - 13) = 6 books. Therefore, there are 6 more books than movies in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series."
"Response:  According to the question, if you have read 19 books and watched 61 movies from the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books by (61 - 19 =) 42 movies. Therefore, there are 42 more movies in the series than books."
"Response: 
Let X be the number of books read and Y be the number of movies watched.
From the problem statement, we know that X + Y = 13 (books read) and X + Y = 12 (movies watched).
Now, let's solve for X and Y separately:
X = 13 - Y (from the first equation)
Y = 12 - X (from the second equation)
Now, we can substitute these expressions in each other to find the value of X and Y:
X = 13 - Y --> Y = 13 - X
Y = 12 - X --> X = 12 - Y
Now, we have two equations with two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously gives us the values of X and Y:
X = 7
Y = 6
Therefore, if you read 7 books and watched 6 movies, you read more than you watched."
"Response: 

From the given information, we know that there are 11 books and 17 movies in the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series. If you have read 7 books, then you have not watched any movies yet. So, the number of movies you have watched is 0.

Now, let's calculate how many more movies you need to watch to catch up with the total number of movies in the series:

Total number of movies = 17
Number of movies you have watched = 0
Difference = Total number of movies - Number of movies you have watched
= 17 - 0
= 17

Therefore, if you have read 7 books from the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series, you still need to watch 17 - 7 = 10 more movies to catch up with the entire series."
"Response:  If there are 8 books in the series that you have already read, and the total number of books is 14, then we need to find out how many more books there are in the series that you haven't read yet.
So, the number of books you still need to read = Total number of books - Number of books you have read
= 14 - 8
= 6
Therefore, you still need to read 6 more books from the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series."
"Response: 
We know that there are 62 different movies and 19 different books in the series.
If we have read 4 books, then we still need to read 62 - 4 = 58 books.
And if we have watched 34 movies, then we still need to watch 62 - 34 = 28 movies.
So, the answer is 58 books and 28 movies."
"Response: 
We know that there are 8 movies and 21 books in total.
If we have read 7 books, then we still need to read 14 books (21 - 7 = 14).
Now, let's consider the movies. If we have watched 4 movies, then we still need to watch 4 movies (8 - 4 = 4).
So, in total, we need to watch 4 + 14 = 18 more movies and read 14 more books."
"Response:  According to the question, there are 15 books and 14 movies in the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series. If you have read 11 books, that means you have not watched any movies yet. So, the number of books you have read is equal to the total number of books in the series minus the number of movies you have watched. Therefore, the number of books you have read is:

15 - 4 = 11

So, there are 11 more books in the series than movies you have watched."
"Response:  According to the question, if you have read 13 books and watched 63 movies from the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series, then the number of movies is greater than the number of books by how many? To find this difference, we need to subtract the number of books (13) from the number of movies (63). So, the difference between the number of movies and books in the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series is 50 (63 - 13)."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, there are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the ""疯狂傻瓜学校"" series. If you have read 14 books and watched 19 movies, then you have read more books than movies. To find out how many more books you have read, we can subtract the number of movies from the number of books: 14 - 6 = 8. So, you have read 8 more books than movies."
"Response: 

The series consists of 8 books and 5 movies. If you have read 16 books and watched 19 movies, then:

Books: You have read 16 - 8 = 8 books that are part of the series.
Movies: You have watched 19 - 5 = 14 movies that are part of the series.

So, you have watched more movies than you have read books. By how many?

14 movies - 8 books = 6 movies

Therefore, if you have watched 19 movies and read 16 books from the ""疯狂傻傻学校"" series, you have watched 6 more movies than you have read books."
Response:  Dave has 7 tickets and he uses some of them to buy toys. So, he must have used at least 3 tickets for that (since he has 4 left). Now, if he still has 2 tickets left after buying toys, then he must have bought 1 toy with each of his remaining 2 tickets. Therefore, Dave used a total of 3 + 2 = 5 tickets to buy toys.
Response:  Dave won x number of tickets at the amusement park and used 12 of them to buy some toys. So he has (x - 12) tickets left. If he has 14 more tickets than he had initially, then the total number of tickets he won is: x = 14 + 12 = 26
Response:  Dave has 18 tickets initially and he uses 5 of them to buy some toys. So now he has 18 - 5 = 13 tickets left. Then he uses 11 more tickets to buy some clothes. So now he has 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left. Therefore, Dave has 2 tickets left.
Response:  Dave won 19 tickets at the amusement park. He used 12 tickets to buy some toys and 7 tickets to buy some clothes. So he has 19 - (12 + 7) = 9 tickets left. Therefore, the number of tickets he used for buying toys is 12, and the number of tickets he used for buying clothes is 7.
Response:  Dave won 13 tickets at the amusement park. He used 8 of them to buy some toys and then he used 18 more to buy some clothes. So, he has 13 - 8 = 5 remaining tickets left.
Response:  Dave won 14 tickets and lost 2 tickets, so he has 14 - 2 = 12 tickets left. If he uses 10 tickets to buy some toys, then he will have 12 - 10 = 2 tickets left.
Response:  If Haley had planted 14 trees in her backyard and after the hurricane, 9 of them died, then we can say that the number of surviving trees is equal to 14 minus the number of dead trees. So, the answer would be: Number of surviving trees = 14 - 9 = 5.
Response:  If Haley had planted 13 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon, 6 of them died, then we can say that there are 13 - 6 = 7 alive trees left in her backyard. So, the number of living trees is 7.
Response:  If Haley planted 20 trees in her backyard and after the typhoon only 4 remained, then we can conclude that 16 trees died (20 - 4 = 16). Therefore, the answer is 16.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Haley planted some trees in her backyard and after a typhoon, 5 of them died. So, there are now 12 - 5 = 7 trees left. Therefore, Haley planted 7 trees initially.
"Response: 
Haley initially planted 9 trees in her backyard. After the typhoon passed, 4 of them died. Then she planted another 5 trees. So, the total number of trees left is:
9 - 4 = 5
Therefore, Haley has 5 trees left in her backyard."
Response:  If she initially planted 12 trees and two died after the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is 12 - 2 = 10. So, there are 10 trees left in her backyard.
Response:  If there were initially 3 trees and 10 survived the typhoon (including the 13 dead ones), then the number of trees that died is 13 - 3 = 10. So, the answer is 10.
"Response:  If there were initially 11 trees and 2 died after the typhoon, then the number of surviving trees is:

11 - 2 = 9

So, there are 9 trees that survived the typhoon."
"Response:  If they harvest 66 baskets of oranges every day and each basket contains 28 oranges, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges harvested per day.
Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket
= 66 x 28
= 1904 oranges/day

Therefore, they harvest 1904 oranges every day."
Response:  If they harvest 8 baskets of oranges every day, it means they need to harvest for how many days to get 24 baskets? So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of days = 24 / 8 = 3 days. Therefore, they will need 3 days to harvest 24 baskets of oranges.
"Response:  If they will continue to harvest for 4 days and they have collected 56 baskets of oranges in total, then we can calculate the number of baskets per day as follows:
Number of baskets per day = Total number of baskets / Number of days
= 56 / 4
= 14 baskets per day"
Response:  If they harvest 38 bags of oranges per day and each bag contains 42 oranges, then in total, they will have collected 38 x 42 = 1657 oranges per day. Now, if they continue to collect oranges for 49 days, they will have collected a total of 1657 x 49 = 80,633 oranges.
Response:  If they harvest 66 baskets per day and each basket contains 25 oranges, then they will have total of 66 x 25 = 1600 oranges in one day. Now, if they continue this process for 87 days, they will have total of 1600 x 87 = 139,400 oranges. Therefore, after 87 days, they will have 139,400 oranges.
Response:  The orange farmer harvests 8 baskets of oranges every day, and each basket contains 35 oranges. So, in total, he harvests 8 x 35 = 280 oranges per day.
Response:  If they are harvesting 16 baskets of oranges per day and each basket has 57 oranges, then they need to harvest for how many days to get 80 baskets? So, we can calculate it as follows: Number of days = Total number of oranges / Number of oranges in one basket x Number of baskets needed = 57 x 80 / 16 = 32 days. Therefore, they will need 32 days to harvest 80 baskets of oranges if they are currently harvesting 16 baskets per day.
"Response:  If they harvested 35 baskets of oranges per day and each basket contains 12 oranges, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges harvested in one day.
Total number of oranges = Number of baskets x Number of oranges in each basket
= 35 baskets x 12 oranges/basket
= 420 oranges/day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges harvested in a week (7 days).
Total number of oranges = Total number of oranges/day x Number of days
= 420 oranges/day x 7 days
= 2940 oranges/week

Therefore, if they harvested 35 baskets of oranges per day, then they harvested a total of 2940 oranges in a week."
Response:  The farmer picks oranges every day and finds that they throw away 71 baskets out of 74 baskets picked each day. This means they have thrown away 3 baskets per day. To find out how many baskets are left after 51 days, we can multiply the number of baskets thrown away per day by 51 days: 3 x 51 = 153 baskets. So, there are 153 baskets of oranges left after 51 days.
Response:  If they pick up 76 baskets of oranges every day and throw away 64 baskets, then they have picked up 12 baskets (76 - 64 = 12) of oranges that are not thrown away. Since each basket contains 50 oranges, they have picked up 12 x 50 = 600 oranges in total. Therefore, they pick up 600 oranges per day.
"Response:  The farmer picks 28 mature oranges and 52 immature oranges every day. After 26 days, they will have picked a total of:
Mature oranges = 28 x 26 = 704 mature oranges
Immature oranges = 52 x 26 = 1328 immature oranges
Therefore, after 26 days, they will have a total of 704 + 1328 = 2032 orange boxes."
Response:  The farmer picks 82 baskets of mature oranges and 61 baskets of immature oranges every day. This means that in total, he picks 82 + 61 = 143 baskets of oranges per day. Since it takes 25 days to harvest all the oranges, the total number of baskets of mature oranges picked is 143 x 25 = 3575 baskets.
Response:  The orange farmer picks 31 baskets of ripe oranges and 24 baskets of unripe oranges every day. This means that in total, he picks 55 baskets of oranges per day (31 + 24). Since there are 45 days left until they will have enough oranges to sell, the number of baskets of unripe oranges they will have after 45 days is: 55 x 45 = 2475 baskets. Therefore, they will have 2475 - 55 = 2420 baskets of unripe oranges after 45 days.
"Response:  According to the problem statement, he found that they harvested 44 baskets of ripe oranges and 25 baskets of unripe oranges every day. So, we can write an equation as follows: 
Riperange = 44 - Unripenrange (1) Where Riperange represents the number of baskets of ripe oranges and Unripenrange represents the number of baskets of unripe oranges. Now, let's solve for Unripenrange using equation (1). We know that the total number of oranges harvested is equal to the sum of ripe and unripe oranges. Therefore, we can write another equation as follows: Totaloranges = Riperange + Unripenrange (2) Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get: Totaloranges = 44 + Unripenrange (3) Now, we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving these equations simultaneously will give us the value of Unripenrange. Let's substitute the values from equation (3) into equation (1): Riperange = 44 - Unripenrange (4) Now, we can solve for Unripenrange: Unripenrange = 25 (5) Therefore, there are 25 baskets of unripe oranges harvested every day."
Response:  The total number of oranges harvested each day is 5 + 74 = 89. So, the number of unripe oranges harvested daily is 89 - 5 = 84.
Response:  If they have already harvested 54 bags of oranges, and they harvest 18 bags per day, then we need to find out how many days it will take for them to harvest all the oranges. We can do this by dividing the total number of bags by the daily output: Number of days = Total bags / Daily output = 54 / 18 = 3 days Therefore, it will take them 3 days to harvest all the oranges.
"Response:  If they harvested 56 bags of oranges in 14 days, then...
Step 1: Calculate the number of bags per day
Number of bags = Total bags / Number of days
= 56 / 14
= 4 bags per day
So, they harvested 4 bags of oranges per day."
Response:  If they are receiving 25 baskets of unripe oranges every day and 5 baskets of ripe oranges every day, then in total, they will have received 25 x 73 = 1825 unripe oranges and 5 x 73 = 365 ripe oranges. So, after 73 days, they will have 1825 + 365 = 2190 oranges that are ripe.
"Response:  On day 1, they harvested 65 baskets of unripe oranges and 46 baskets of ripe oranges. If they continue to harvest for 6 days, then on the last day (day 7), they will have harvested:

Unripe oranges: 65 x 6 = 390 baskets
Ripe oranges: 46 x 6 = 286 baskets
Therefore, after 6 days of continuous harvesting, they will have a total of 390 + 286 = 676 baskets of oranges."
"Response:  If they harvest 41 baskets of immature oranges and 86 baskets of mature oranges every day, then we can write this as:

41 + 86 = Total number of baskets harvested per day
Now, let's find out how many more baskets of mature oranges are harvested than immature ones:

86 - 41 = Number of more baskets of mature oranges harvested than immature ones
So, there are 45 more baskets of mature oranges harvested than immature ones every day."
"Response:  If they harvest 71 baskets of immature oranges and 60 baskets of mature oranges every day, then we can write this as:
71 + 60 = Total number of baskets harvested per day
Now, let's find out how many more immature oranges are harvested than mature ones:
Total number of immature oranges - Total number of mature oranges = Number of more immature oranges harvested
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
71 - 60 = 11
So, there are 11 more immature oranges harvested than mature ones every day."
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 12 feet and its width is 11 feet. To find out how much longer it is than wide, we need to subtract their values. So, the difference between the length and width is: 12 - 11 = 1 foot. Therefore, Jesse's room is one foot longer than its width.
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a rug with an area of 14 square feet, we can calculate the length of the room based on the width of the rug. The formula for this is: Length = Width x Area / Square Feet So, if we want to find out how wide the room is, we need to divide the area of the rug (in square feet) by its length (also in square feet). In this case, the area of the rug is 14 square feet, and its length is unknown. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows: Length = 14 / X Where X is the width of the room in square feet. Now we are given that Jesse's room is 7 feet long, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Length = 14 / X Substituting 7 for X, we get: Length = 14 / 7 = 2 feet Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 2 feet wide.
Response:  We know that Jesse's room is 7 feet wide and we need to find out how long it is based on the area of the carpet she needs. The area of the carpet she needs is 14 square feet. So, we can start with the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length x Width. Since we don't know the length directly, let's use the width (which is 7 feet) as our base and try to find the length in terms of the width. Therefore, we have: Area = 7 x Length Now, we are given that the area of the carpet she needs is 14 square feet. So, substituting this value into the equation above, we get: 14 = 7xL Now, dividing both sides by 7 gives us: L = 2 Which means that Jesse's room is 2 times longer than its width.
Response:  The room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, so its area is 11 x 15 = 165 square feet. Since she already has 16 square feet of carpet, she needs 165 - 16 = 149 square feet more to cover the entire floor.
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 2 feet, and its width is 12 feet. To cover the entire floor with tiles, we need to calculate how many tiles are needed based on the area of the floor. We know that each tile has an area of 4 square feet, so...
Response:  The length of Jesse's room is 19 feet and its width is 18 feet. To find out how many square feet there are in each room, we multiply the length by the width: 19 x 18 = 342 sq ft per room. Since Jesse has 20 rooms, she needs 342 sq ft / 20 rooms = 17.1 sq ft of carpet to cover all the floors. Therefore, Jesse needs 17.1 sq ft of carpet to cover all the floors.
Response:  The width of Jesse's room is 19 feet and its length is 20 feet. To find out how much longer it is than wide, we need to divide the length by the width: Length / Width = 20 ft / 19 ft = 1.056 (approximately). So, Jesse's room is approximately 5.6% longer than wider.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room. Since we are given that the length of the room is 5 feet, we can find out the width of the room by dividing the area of the rug by its length. So, the width of the room = Area of rug / Length of room = 10 sq ft / 5 ft = 2 ft. Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.
Response:  We know that Jesse needs a rug that is 10 square feet in size to cover her room. Since we are given that the width of the room is 2 feet, we can find the length of the room as follows: Length = Width x Area of Rug / Size of Room = 2 x 10 / 10 = 20 feet Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 20 feet.
Response:  The area of the floor is given as 18 square feet. To find out how much carpeting Jesse needs to cover the entire floor, we need to divide the area of the floor by the length and width of her room. So, let's do that calculation: Area of Room = Length x Width = 4 ft x 20 ft = 80 sq ft Now, we can see that Jesse needs (18 sq ft) / (80 sq ft) = 22.5 linear feet of carpeting to cover the entire floor. Therefore, she will need 23 linear feet of carpeting.
Response:  According to the problem statement, they sold T-shirts and earned $23 per sale during Arkansas-Texas A&M game weekend. So, if they sold x T-shirts, they earned $x x 23 = 230 dollars. Therefore, they sold 10 T-shirts (x = 10).
Response:  We know that there are three T-shirts sold and the total amount earned is $51. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of T-shirts = Total amount earned / Price of each T-shirt. Now, let's find out the price of each T-shirt. According to the question, the store made $51 in total, and each T-shirt was sold for $17. So, we can substitute these values into our equation: Number of T-shirts = $51 / $17 = 3 Therefore, the store sold 3 T-shirts during the competition period.
Response:  If they sold 95 T-shirts in total during both games, and they sold 47 T-shirts during the Arkansas game, then the number of T-shirts sold during the Texas game is 95 - 47 = 48. Since each T-shirt sells for $87, the total amount of money earned from selling T-shirts during the Texas game is 48 x $87 = $4236.
Response:  If they sold 115 T-shirts during the Arkansas game and made $106 per sale, then they earned $11,930 ($106 x 115) from those sales. Now, we need to find out how many T-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game. We know that their total sales were 242, so if they sold X fewer T-shirts during the Texas Tech game than they did during the Arkansas game, then their total sales for both games would be 242 - X. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 115X = 11,930 (1). Solving for X, we get: X = 1067 (2). So, they sold 1067 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
Response:  If they sold 163 T-shirts in total during both games, and they sold 89 T-shirts in Arkansas game, then the number of T-shirts sold in Texas game is 74 (163 - 89). Since each T-shirt costs $9.80 to produce, the total revenue from selling T-shirts in Texas game is: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt = 74 x $9.80 = $725.20 So, the amount of money earned from selling T-shirts in Texas game is $725.20.
Response:  If they sold $78 per t-shirt in Arkansas and $78 x 186 = $14,304 in total sales during both games combined. So if they sold $172 t-shirts in Arkansas, then they made $172 x $78 = $13,596 more in Texas game alone. Therefore, their profit from selling t-shirts in Texas was $14,304 + $13,596 = $27,800.
"Response:  We know that each T-shirt costs $62 and each jersey costs $99. If they sold 183 T-shirts and 31 jerseys, then their total revenue from these items is:
Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price per jersey
= 183 x $62 + 31 x $99
= $10,753 + $2,993
= $13,746
Therefore, they earned $13,746 from selling T-shirts and jerseys at the Arkansas-Texas A&M game."
"Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 74, and each T-shirt brings in $67. So, the total amount earned from selling T-shirts is:

$67 x 74 = $4,898

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned from selling jerseys. Since there are 156 jerseys sold, and each jersey brings in $165, the total amount earned from selling jerseys is:

$165 x 156 = $25,340

So, the total amount earned from both T-shirts and jerseys is:

$4,898 + $25,340 = $30,238"
Response:  We know that each T-shirt costs $19 and each jersey costs $34. So if they sold 157 T-shirts and 19 jerseys, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of Jerseys x Price of Jersey In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 157 x $19 + 19 x $34 = $6,803 + $653 = $7,456 Therefore, one T-shirt costs less than one jersey by $7,456 - $6,803 = $653.
Response:  We know that each T-shirt costs $86 and each jersey costs $232. So, if they sold 254 T-shirts and 43 jerseys, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price of jersey In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 254 x $86 + 43 x $232 = $21,792 Now, let's find out how much more expensive a jersey is compared to a T-shirt: Difference in price = Price of jersey - Price of T-shirt = $232 - $86 = $146 Therefore, one jersey costs $146 more than one T-shirt.
"Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 130. Each T-shirt costs $51, so the total revenue from sales is:

Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price per T-shirt
= 130 x $51
= $6,430

So, they earned $6,430 from selling T-shirts during the competition period in Arkansas and Texas Tech University."
"Response:  
Firstly, each T-shirt was sold for $201 before the competition. So, if they sold 14 T-shirts, their total revenue from selling T-shirts would be:
$201 x 14 = $2854
Now, after the competition, they increased the price of each T-shirt by $217, so the new price of each T-shirt became:
$201 + ($201 x 217%) = $369
So, if they still sold 14 T-shirts after increasing the prices, their total revenue from selling T-shirts would become:
$369 x 14 = $5066
Therefore, the amount of money they earned from selling T-shirts during the competition is $5066."
Response:  If they sold T-shirts and earned $60 in total, that means each T-shirt they sold brought in $60 / 1 = $60 per sale. So if they sold x T-shirts, then their total earnings would be x x $60 = $x600. Therefore, they sold 10 T-shirts ($600 / $60).
Response:  We know that T-shirts were sold during a competition in Arkansas and Texas Tech University. So, we can assume that the price of each T-shirt is $X. Since they earned $215 from selling 5 T-shirts, we can write an equation as follows: X × 5 = 215 Now, let's solve for X: X = 215 / 5 = $43 per T-shirt Therefore, the price of each T-shirt is $43.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 20, and each T-shirt costs $215. So, they earned $4300 from selling T-shirts. Now, let's move to the baseball jerseys. Since there are 64 baseball jerseys sold, and each jersey costs $5, their earnings from selling baseball jerseys would be $64 x $5 = $320. Therefore, in total, they earned $4300 + $320 = $4620.
Response:  The total number of T-shirts sold is 158, and each T-shirt costs $204. So, they earned a total of $31,920 from selling T-shirts ($204 x 158). Now, let's calculate how much money they earned from selling hoodies. Since there are only two hoodies sold, their total earnings from these items would be $400 ($204 x 2). Therefore, their total earnings from both T-shirts and hoodies come to $31,960 ($31,920 + $400).
Response:  According to the information given in the question, each T-shirt costs $240 and each basketball jersey costs $210. So, if they sold 177 T-shirts and 23 basketball jerseys, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of basketball jerseys x Price of basketball jersey In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 177 x $240 + 23 x $210 = $56,980 + $4,930 = $61,910 Therefore, one T-shirt costs more than one basketball jersey by $240 - $210 = $30.
Response:  We know that each T-shirt costs $25 and each basketball jersey costs $115. So, if they sold 113 T-shirts and 78 basketball jerseys, we can calculate their total revenue as follows: Total Revenue = Number of T-shirts x Price of T-shirt + Number of basketball jerseys x Price of basketball jersey In this case, the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 113 x $25 + 78 x $115 = $9,625 + $8,400 = $18,025 Therefore, the difference between the price of a basketball jersey and a T-shirt is $115 - $25 = $90 per item.
Response:  If they have 5 tables and each table has 10 chairs, then the total number of chairs is 5 x 10 = 50 chairs. So, there are 50 chairs in total.
Response:  If they have two tables with equal number of chairs, then there are twice as many chairs in total. So, if each table has x chairs, then the total number of chairs is 2x. Since there are 12 chairs in total, we can set up the equation: 2x = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 6. Therefore, each table has 6 chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 chairs in total and each set of tables has 3 chairs, then we can deduce that there are 9 / 3 = 3 sets of tables. Therefore, they have 3 sets of tables.
Response:  If they have 11 tables and each table has 13 chairs, then the total number of chairs is: 11 x 13 = 143 chairs.
"Response:  If there are 11 people sitting at the tables and each table has 6 chairs, then the total number of unused chairs is:

11 x 6 = 66

So, there are 66 unused chairs."
Response:  The total number of tables is 12, and each table has 14 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is 12 x 14 = 168 chairs. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs available for guests is 168 + 6 = 174 chairs.
Response:  If there are 14 people attending the party and each table has 3 chairs, then how many tables will they need? There are 14 / 3 = 4.5 tables. Since you can't have half a table, they will need 5 tables in total. So, they will need 5 x 3 = 15 chairs.
Response:  If they have 9 sets of tables (which means they have 9 x 14 = 126 chairs in total). So if they want to know how many more chairs they have than tables, we subtract the number of tables from the total number of chairs: 126 - 9 = 117 chairs. Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables.
Response:  If Lewis earned $460 in total over 5 weeks, that means he earned an average of $92 per week. So, his weekly income is $92.
Response:  If 刘易斯 earned $1216 during the harvest season and he earns $16 per week, then we can calculate the number of weeks as follows: Number of weeks = Total amount earned / Weekly income $1216 / $16/week = 75 weeks Therefore, the harvest season lasted for 75 weeks.
"Response:  If 刘易斯 earns $21 per week for 216 weeks, his total income is:
$21 x 216 = $4388
If he pays $702 in taxes, his remaining amount after paying taxes is:
$4388 - $702 = $3686
Therefore, at the end of the harvest season, 刘易斯 will have $3686."
Response:  If he earns $1357 per week during an income season of 22 weeks, his total income for that season will be: $1357 x 22 = $28,640. Now, if he works for 73 income seasons, his total income will be: $28,640 x 73 = $2,039,840.
"Response:  Louis earns $28 per week during harvest season and $939 per week when he works overtime. Since there are 1091 weeks in a year, his total income from working overtime is:
$939 x 1091 = $1,027,430
Now, let's calculate how much money Louis makes during harvest season:
$28 x 1091 = $296,580
So, Louis makes a total of:
$1,027,430 + $296,580 = $1,324,010
in a year."
Response:  Louis earns $403 per week during the harvest season and pays $49 in rent each week. To find out how much money he has left after paying rent, we can subtract the amount of rent from his weekly income: $403 - $49 = $354. So, Louis makes $354 per week during the harvest season.
"Response:  Louis earns $368 per week during the harvest season and pays $388 in rent every week. To find out how much he paid in total for rent during the harvest season, we can multiply his weekly income by the number of weeks in the harvest season:
$368/week x 1359 weeks = $472,000
So, Louis paid $472,000 in rent during the harvest season."
"Response:  Louis earns $491 per week and works for 118 weeks in a season. Therefore, his total income during that season is:
$491 x 118 = $57,098
Now, he has to pay $216 per week as rent. So, the amount of money he will have at the end of the season after paying rent is:
$57,098 - ($216 x 118) = $53,672
Therefore, Louis will have $53,672 left over after paying rent at the end of the season."
Response:  Louis earned $133 in total over 19 weeks. To find out how much he earned per week, we can divide the total amount he earned by the number of weeks he worked: $133 / 19 = $7 per week. Therefore, Louis earned $7 per week.
Response:  Louis earns $2 per week, so he has earned $2 x 4 weeks = $8 in the first month. In total, he has earned $8 + $2 x 3 months = $8 + $6 = $14. Therefore, the duration of the harvest season is 14 / $2 = 7 weeks.
"Response:  If water is 10 times deeper than Devin's height, then...
Step 1: Convert Devin's height from feet to meters. There are 0.3048 meters in one foot, so...
Devin's height = 9 × 0.3048 = 2.736 meters
Step 2: Calculate the depth of the water relative to Devin's height. Since the water is 10 times deeper than his height, we can multiply his height by 10 to get the depth of the water:
Depth of water = 2.736 meters × 10 = 27.36 meters
Therefore, the water is approximately 27.36 meters deep compared to Devin's height."
Response:  We know that Devin is 2 times taller than his height in water, so he must be 2 x 7 = 14 feet tall. Now we can calculate how deep the water is: Water depth = Devin's height - Roan's height = 14 - 5 = 9 feet.
Response:  We know that the water is 5 times deeper than Roan's height, so if Roan is 6 feet tall (72 inches), then the water is 360 inches deep (5 x 72). Now we know that Diann is 11 feet shorter than Roan, which means she is 5 feet 11 inches shorter (69 inches). So the depth of the water from where Roan is standing is now 360 - 69 = 291 inches.
Response:  We know that Devin is 6 feet tall (72 inches). So if he jumps in the water, the water will be 72 inches deep. Now we need to find out how much deeper it needs to be for Ronan, who is 4 feet tall (48 inches) and stands at 13 feet away from the shore. To do this, we subtract 48 inches (Ronan's height) from 72 inches (Devin's height): 72 - 48 = 24 inches. Therefore, the water is 24 inches deeper where Ronan is standing.
"Response:  We know that the water is 16 times deeper than Roan's height and Dane is 9 feet taller than Roan. So if Roan stands at 13 feet tall, how deep will the water be? 
Let's convert all measurements to the same unit (e.g., feet) for simplicity:
Roan's height = 5 feet (since he's 5 feet tall)
Dane's height = 9 feet + 5 feet = 14 feet (since he's 9 feet taller than Roan)
Water depth = 16 x Roan's height = 16 x 5 feet = 80 feet
So the water is approximately 80 feet deep in this scenario."
Response:  We know that the water is 9 times deeper than Devin's height. So, if Devin's height is x feet, then the depth of the water is 9x feet. Now, we are told that Roan's height is 15 feet, and he is 6 feet shorter than Devin. Therefore, Roan's height is 15 - 6 = 9 feet. Since the water is 9 times deeper than Devin's height, it is also 9 times deeper than Roan's height. So, the depth of the water is 9(9) = 81 feet.
Response:  If Brian has 34 books and wants to divide them equally among two bookshelves, each bookshelf can hold how many books? We know that $x$ is the number of books that each bookshelf can hold, so we can write an equation: $\frac{34}{2} = x$. Now, simplify the equation: $17 = x$. Therefore, each bookshelf can hold $17$ books.
Response:  If Brian has 42 books in total and each bookshelf has 2 books, then... (1)...Brian has 42 / 2 = 21 bookshelves.
Response:  If he has 23 bookshelves and each shelf has 27 books, then... (1)...he has 23 x 27 = 591 books in total. Now, if each shelf also has 80 magazines, then... (2)...he has 591 + 80 = 671 items in total. So, the answer is 671.
Response:  If he has 10 bookshelves and each shelf has 9 books, then he has 9 x 10 = 90 books in total. And if each shelf also has 46 magazines, then he has 46 x 10 = 460 magazines in total. So, he has 90 + 460 = 550 publications in total.
Response:  If he has 29 bookshelves and each shelf has 23 books, then he has a total of 29 x 23 = 753 books. Similarly, if each shelf has 61 magazines, then he has a total of 29 x 61 = 1829 magazines. So, in total, he has 753 books and 1829 magazines.
Response:  If Brian has 7 bookshelves and each shelf has the same number of books, then he must have X books in total. Since there are 28 books in total, we can write an equation as follows: 7X = 28. Now, let's solve for X: X = 28 / 7 = 4. So, Brian has 4 books on each of his 7 bookshelves, for a total of 28 books.
"Response:  If Brian has 38 books in total and each bookshelf has two books, then...

1. How many bookshelves does Brian have? (Since each bookshelf has 2 books)
Bookshelves = Total number of books / Number of books per shelf
= 38 books / 2 books/shelf
= 19 bookshelves

Therefore, Brian has 19 bookshelves!"
"Response:  If Carole wants to invite 10 friends for her birthday party and each invitation requires two invitations in a package, then she needs:

$$ \text{Number of packages} = \frac{\text{Total number of invitations}}{\text{Number of invitations per package}} $$

Given that Carole wants to invite 10 friends, the total number of invitations is:

$$ \text{Total number of invitations} = 10 \times 2 = 20 $$

Since each package contains 2 invitations, we need:

$$ \text{Number of packages} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 $$

Therefore, Carole needs 10 packages to ensure that all her friends are invited."
Response:  Since there are 12 friends and Carole bought 3 packages of invitation cards, each package has 12 / 3 = 4 invitations. So, in total, Carole has 4 x 3 = 12 invitation cards.
Response:  If Carol bought 7 packages of invitations and each package has 10 invitations, then she has in total 7 x 10 = 70 invitations. Now, if she sends only 2 invitations to her friends, then she will have 70 - 2 = 68 invitations left over. So, there are 68 invitations left over after Carol sends them to her friends.
"Response:  
Carol bought 6 packages of invitation cards, each package contains 14 invitations. So, she has bought a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations. 
Then, she bought additional 11 invitations, so the total number of invitations Carol can send is 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. 
Therefore, Carol can invite 95 friends to her party."
"Response:  If Carole wants to invite 9 friends, and each pack contains 3 invitation cards, then she needs:
Number of packs = Number of friends / Number of cards per pack
= 9 friends / 3 cards per pack
= 3 packs
So, Carole needs to buy 3 more packs of invitation cards."
Response:  If 梅丽莎 (Melissa) scored 12 points in each game and she played n games, then her total score is 12n. Since she scored 36 points in total, we can set up the equation: 12n = 36. Now, we need to solve for n. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 12: n = 36 / 12 = 3. So, Melissa played 3 games.
Response:  If Mei Lihua played three games and scored 81 points in total, then she must have scored an average of 27 points per game (81/3 = 27).
Response:  According to the question, Mei Lihua scored 109 points in each game and received 82 bonus points for every game she played. Therefore, her total score can be calculated as follows: Total Score = Number of games x Points per game + Bonus points So, we need to find out how many games Mei Lihua played. According to the question, she played 79 games in total. Now, let's substitute this value into the formula above: Total Score = 79 x 109 + 79 x 82 =? To solve for the total score, we can simplify the equation as follows: Total Score = 79 x (109 + 82) = 6,538 So, Mei Lihua scored a total of 6,538 points throughout the competition.
"Response:  If she got 21 points in total and each game is worth 7 points, then...

Step 1: How many games did she play?
21 / 7 = x
x = 3
So, Mei Li played 3 games."
Response:  If Mei Lihua scored 91 points in total across 13 games, and each game she scored the same number of points, then we can write an equation as follows: Total score = Number of games x Score per game So, if we substitute the values given in the question, we get: Total score = 13 x Score per game Now, we are asked to find out how many points Mei Lihua scored in each game. To do this, we divide the total score by the number of games: Score per game = Total score / Number of games Substituting the values we obtained earlier, we get: Score per game = 91 / 13 = 7 So, Mei Lihua scored 7 points in each game.
Response:  If there are 4 seats in the Ferris wheel and it can accommodate 20 people at once, then each seat can accommodate how many people? We need to divide the total number of people that can be accommodated (20) by the number of seats available (4). So, each seat can accommodate 5 people (20 / 4 = 5).
Response:  If each seat can accommodate 9 people, then we have: Number of seats = Total number of passengers / Number of people per seat = 18 / 9 = 2 seats Therefore, there are 2 seats in the Ferris wheel.
Response:  We know that each gondola can accommodate 15 people, and there are 19 gondolas in total. So, we need to find out how many people can ride at most in all the gondolas together. To do this, we multiply the number of gondolas by the maximum capacity of each gondola: 19 x 15 = 285 people. Therefore, the maximum number of people who can ride on 20 Ferris wheels is 285.
"Response:  If there are 18 seats in total and each seat can accommodate 15 people, then the maximum capacity of the Ferris wheel is:

18 seats x 15 people/seat = 270 people
So, if 10 seats are broken, the maximum number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is:

270 people - 10 seats = 260 people"
Response:  If there are 6 seats in the Ferris wheel and each seat can accommodate 14 people, then the total capacity of the Ferris wheel is 6 x 14 = 84 people. Now, if there are already 16 people on the Ferris wheel, we cannot add more than 84 - 16 = 68 additional people. So, the maximum number of people who can join the Ferris wheel is 68.
"Response:  We know that there are 2 small seats and 23 large seats in the Ferris wheel. Since each small seat can accommodate 14 people, we have:

Number of small seats = 2 x 14 = 28 people
Since each large seat can accommodate 54 people, we have:

Total number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel = Number of small seats + Number of large seats
= 28 + (23 x 54) = 1690 people
Therefore, the Ferris wheel can accommodate 1690 people."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 small seats and 7 large seats in total. Each small seat can accommodate 16 people, so we have:

3 x 16 = 48 people who can sit in the small seats.

Now, each large seat can accommodate 12 people, so we have:

7 x 12 = 84 people who can sit in the large seats.

In total, we have:

48 + 84 = 132 people who can sit in the seats of the Ferris wheel."
Response:  If the Ferris wheel can accommodate 16 people at once in each rotation, and there are 4 seats per ride, then we need to divide 16 by 4 to find out how many people each seat can hold. So, the answer is 4.
"Response:  If we can sit 4 people at once in the Ferris wheel, and each seat can accommodate 2 people, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many seats are available for 4 people to sit at once.
Seats per person = 4 (people) / 2 (seats per person) = 2 seats
So, there are 2 seats available for 4 people to sit at once.
Step 2: Now, calculate the total number of seats in the Ferris wheel.
Total seats = Number of seats available x Total number of people who can sit at once
= 2 seats x? (number of people who can sit at once)
Therefore, the Ferris wheel has? seats."
Response:  We know that we have purchased 7 pizzas and each pizza has an equal number of thin slices. Therefore, the total number of thin slices is 7 x Number of thin slices per pizza = 7 x 14 = 98 thin slices. So, there are 98 thin slices in total.
"Response:  If each pizza has 2 slices and we ordered a total of 28 pieces, then...

Step 1: Calculate the number of pizzas we ordered.
Number of pizzas = Total number of slices / Number of slices per pizza
= 28 / 2
= 14 pizzas

Therefore, we ordered 14 pizzas."
Response:  We have purchased 17 pizzas and each pizza has 4 slices. Therefore, we have a total of 17 x 4 = 68 slices of pizza. Since there are 25 people, each person will get how many slices? Answer: 68 / 25 = 2.72 slices per person. So, each person will get approximately 2-3 slices of pizza.
Response:  We have purchased 9 pizzas and each pizza has 10 slices. If we want to distribute them equally among 2 people, then... (1) Divide 9 by 2 = 4.5 pizzas per person. Since you can't divide a pizza into half, round up to the nearest whole number... (2) Each person will get 5 pizzas.
Response:  If there are 45 flower beds and each flower bed has 10 seeds, then the total number of seeds is: 45 x 10 = 450 seeds.
Response:  If 佩奇 is helping his mother plant flowers in 9 flower beds and they together planted 45 seeds, then we can assume that each flower bed received an equal number of seeds. Therefore, the number of seeds planted in each flower bed is 45/9 = 5 seeds per bed.
Response:  We know that Patchi is helping his mother plant flowers and they together planted 36 seeds. Since each flower bed has 12 seeds but only 58 seeds grew into flowers, we can deduce that there are $ \boxed{7} $ flower beds in total. Therefore, the answer is $ \boxed{7} $.
Response:  We know that Patchi and his mother together planted 55 seeds. Since each flower bed has 15 seeds, they have 55 / 15 = 3.7 seeds per flower bed. However, since only 60 flowers grew in total, we can deduce that not all of the seeds germinated or were able to grow into flowers. So, the number of flowers that actually grew is 60 - (3.7 x Number of Flower Beds) = 60 - (3.7 x 3) = 60 - 12 = 48 flowers. Therefore, there are 48 flowers grown by Patchi and his mother.
"Response:  If Patchi is helping his mother plant flowers and they have 10 seeds per flower bed, then...
Step 1: How many flower beds do they have in total?
Total number of flower beds = Number of seeds / Number of seeds per flower bed
= 60 seeds / 10 seeds per flower bed
= 6 flower beds
Therefore, there are 6 flower beds in total."
"Response:  If 佩奇 is helping his mother in 8 flower beds and they have planted 32 seeds in total, then each flower bed has received an equal number of seeds. Therefore, we can write:
Number of seeds per flower bed = Total number of seeds / Number of flower beds
= 32 / 8
= 4 seeds per flower bed
So, each flower bed has 4 seeds."
Response:  If Ma Su has 11 friends and gives each of them 2 pieces of bread, then he will give away 2 x 11 = 22 pieces of bread in total. So, after giving away all the bread, Ma Su will have 11 - 22 = -9 pieces of bread left. Therefore, Ma Su will have negative 9 pieces of bread left.
"Response:  If 马修 has 8 pieces of bread and wants to share them equally among his friends, he will give each friend 8/n = 1/n pieces of bread, where n is the number of friends. Since there are 4 options for the number of friends (1, 2, 3, or 4), we can calculate the total number of pieces of bread that 马修 gave away as follows: 
Option 1: 马修 gives 1 piece of bread to 1 friend, so he gave away 8 - 1 = 7 pieces of bread.
Option 2: 马修 gives 2 pieces of bread to 2 friends, so he gave away 8 - 2 = 6 pieces of bread.
Option 3: 马修 gives 3 pieces of bread to 3 friends, so he gave away 8 - 3 = 5 pieces of bread.
Option 4: 马修 gives 4 pieces of bread to 4 friends, so he gave away 8 - 4 = 4 pieces of bread.
Therefore, the answer is 7, 6, 5, or 4 pieces of bread."
Response:  If Ma Su has 15 pieces of bread and wants to distribute them equally among his 5 friends, each friend will get 3 pieces of bread (15 / 5 = 3). So, there are 10 pieces of bread left over after distribution (15 - 3 x 5 = 10).
Response:  If Ma Su has 24 pieces of bread and he wants to distribute them equally among his 3 friends, then each friend will get 8 pieces of bread (24/3 = 8). So, after distributing the bread, there will be 17 pieces left with Ma Su (24 - 8 = 17).
Response:  If Ma Su has 22 pieces of bread and 34 cakes, then he will have 22 + 34 = 56 total items to distribute among his 11 friends. Since each friend gets an equal number of items, the number of items each friend receives is 56 / 11 = 5 pieces of bread and 5 x 34 = 170 pieces of cake. Therefore, each friend eats 5 pieces of bread and 170 pieces of cake.
Response:  If Ma Su has 29 pieces of bread and 30 pieces of cake, he will have 29 + 30 = 59 total pieces of food to distribute among his two friends. Since each friend will get an equal amount of food, Ma Su will give each friend 59 / 2 = 29.5 pieces of food (rounded up to 30 pieces). So each friend will get 30 pieces of cake.
"Response:  If Ma Su has 14 pieces of bread and 21 pieces of cake, and he wants to divide them equally among his 7 friends, then each friend will get:

* Bread: 14 / 7 = 2 pieces per person
* Cake: 21 / 7 = 3 pieces per person

Therefore, each friend will eat 2 pieces of bread and 3 pieces of cake."
"Response:  If Mao has 36 pieces of bread and wants to give each of his 18 friends an equal number, then he will have to distribute them equally among his friends. Therefore, we can divide 36 by 18 to get the number of pieces of bread that each friend will receive:

36 / 18 = 2

So each friend will receive 2 pieces of bread from Mao."
"Response:  If 马修 gave each of his friends 6 biscuits, and he has 36 biscuits in total, then the number of friends he gave biscuits to is:
36 / 6 = 6
So, 马修 gave biscuits to 6 friends."
Response:  If Ma has 23 pieces of bread and gives an equal number to each of his two friends, then he will give 23/2 = 11 pieces of bread to each friend. So, each friend gets 11 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Ma Su has 31 pieces of bread and gives each of his 5 friends an equal number (since they are all given the same amount), then he will give out 31 / 5 = 6 pieces to each friend. So, in total, Ma Su gave away 6 x 5 = 30 pieces of bread. Therefore, after giving them away, Ma Su will have 31 - 30 = 1 piece of bread left over.
Response:  If Ma gives each of his four friends an equal number of cookies and cakes, then he will give them 8 cookies (since there are 4 friends) and 24 cakes (since there are 4 times as many cakes as cookies). So, if Ma initially has 32 cookies and 98 cakes, then he will have 24 cookies left after giving them to his friends (since 32 / 4 = 8), and he will have given away 72 cakes (since 98 / 4 = 24). Therefore, each friend got 8 cookies and 16 cakes (since 72 / 4 = 16).
Response:  If Mao has initially 10 pieces of bread and 8 pies, then he will have 10 + 8 = 18 pieces of food in total. If he gives each of his 4 friends an equal amount (i.e., 4 times as much), then he will give them 18 / 4 = 4.5 pieces of food per friend. Since you cannot divide food into half or quarter pieces, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 pieces of food per friend. Therefore, each friend will get 5 pieces of bread and 5 pies from Mao.
Response:  If Mao has initially 13 pieces of bread and 15 pieces of cake, then he will have 13 + 15 = 28 pieces of food in total. Since he wants to divide them equally among his 28 friends, each friend will get 28 / 28 = 1 piece of bread and 28 / 28 = 1 piece of cake. Therefore, each person will eat 1 piece of bread and 1 piece of cake.
Response:  If Daisy buys x water bottles and drinks them at a rate of 109 per day, then after 74 days she will have drunk a total of 74x bottles. So, if she bought x bottles initially, then she has (74x - x) bottles left now. Therefore, the number of water bottles Daisy bought is equal to (74x - x).
Response:  If Daisy bought 153 water bottles and drank the same number every day for 17 days, then she would have drunk a total of 153 x 17 = 2491 bottles. So, her daily consumption is 2491 / 17 = 146 bottles per day.
"Response:  If she bought 264 bottles and drank 15 per day for 11 days, then the total number of bottles she drank is: 
264 x 11 = 2910
So, there are 2910 - 264 = 2666 bottles left."
"Response:  If she bought 301 bottles and drank 144 per day, then the number of days she has been drinking is:
$$ \text {Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total bottles drunk}}{\text{Total bottles bought}} $$
So, in this case, we have:
$$ \boxed{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{301}{144} = 2\text{ years} $$
Therefore, she has been drinking for 2 years."
"Response:  
Day 1: 
* 黛比 drinks 4 water bottles = 4/88 = 0.0469 (days)
* Remaining water bottles = 88 - 4 = 84

Day 2:
* 黛比 drinks 4 water bottles = 4/84 = 0.0479 (days)
* Remaining water bottles = 84 - 4 = 80

...

Day n:
* 黛比 drinks 4 water bottles = 4/80 = 0.05 (days)
* Remaining water bottles = 80 - 4 = 76

Therefore, the water bottles can last for approximately 76 days."
"Response:  
Day 1: 
* 黛比 drinks 312 water bottles and 4 sugar-water bottles = (312 + 4) x 1 = 316
* Remaining sugar-water bottles = 256 - 4 = 252

Day 2:
* 黛比 drinks 312 water bottles and 4 sugar-water bottles = (312 + 4) x 2 = 624
* Remaining sugar-water bottles = 252 - 4 = 248

...

Day n:
* 黛比 drinks 312 water bottles and 4 sugar-water bottles = (312 + 4) x n = n(312 + 4)
* Remaining sugar-water bottles = 252 - 4 = 248

Since the number of days is unknown, we cannot determine the exact number of sugar-water bottles that will last. However, we can see that as long as 黛比 continues to drink at this rate, she will eventually run out of sugar-water bottles."
"Response:  If she drinks 6 bottles of water per day and has bought 12 bottles in total, then we can calculate how many days she can use these 12 bottles as follows:

Days = Total amount of water / Amount of water used per day
= 12 bottles / 6 bottles per day
= 2 days

So, Devi can use the 12 bottles of water for 2 days."
Response:  If Daisy buys 180 bottles of mineral water and she drinks 54 bottles every day, then how many days will it last? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of bottles = Number of bottles bought - Number of bottles consumed per day = 180 - 54 = 126 bottles So, the mineral water will last for 126 days.
Response:  If Dibi drinks 122 bottles of mineral water and 9 bottles of soda water per day, then she will finish all her soda water in 14 days (since there are 122 / 9 = 13.55 days left after one day). Therefore, the soda water can last for at most 14 days.
"Response:  If she has 14 rows of pens and each row has 11 pens, then we have:
14 x 11 = 154 pens in total. Therefore, there are 154 pens in total."
Response:  If we divide 12 pens into 3 rows of equal length, each row will have 4 pens (12 / 3 = 4). So there are 4 pens in each row.
Response:  If she has 28 packages of pencils and each package contains 24 pencils, then she has a total of 28 x 24 = 672 pencils. Since each line requires 16 pencils, she can make 672 / 16 = 43 lines. Therefore, she can make 43 lines.
"Response: 

1. The girl has 6 boxes of pencils.
	* Each box contains 14 pencils (as stated in the problem).
	So, the total number of pencils in all 6 boxes is 6 x 14 = 84 pencils.
2. Now, we need to add the number of pencils that the girl already had before she put the new ones in the boxes.
	* According to the problem, the girl had 22 pencils placed around her desk.
	So, the total number of pencils the girl has now is 84 + 22 = 106 pencils.
Therefore, the girl has 106 pencils in total."
Response:  If she has 35 steel pens and wants to write 5 lines per row, then she needs 35/5 = 7 rows of writing. Since she also has 7 wooden pencils, she can add an extra line for each wooden pencil, which is 7 + 1 = 8 total rows of writing. Therefore, she can make 8 rows of writing.
Response:  If she has 19 rows of pens and each row has 4 steel pens and 27 graphite pens, then we can calculate as follows: Number of steel pens = Total number of pens / Number of rows of steel pens = 19 x 4 = 76 Steel pens Number of graphite pens = Total number of pens - Number of steel pens = 19 x 27 = 503 Graphite pens Therefore, there are 76 steel pens and 503 graphite pens in total.
Response:  If she has 7 rows of pens and each row has 36 steel pens and 30 ink pens, then the total number of steel pens is 7 x 36 = 252, and the total number of ink pens is 7 x 30 = 210. So, there are 252 steel pens and 210 ink pens in total.
Response:  If she has 11 rows of pens and each row has 31 pencils (铅笔) and 27 pens (蜡笔), then we can calculate as follows: Total number of pencils = Number of rows x Number of pencils per row Total number of pens = Number of rows x Number of pens per row Now let's substitute the values given in the question into these formulas: Total number of pencils = 11 x 31 = 331 Total number of pens = 11 x 27 = 297 So, the girl has 331 pencils and 297 pens.
"Response:  If she has 30 pens and each row contains 5 pens, then...

Step 1: How many rows can she make with 30 pens?
Total number of pens = 30
Number of pens per row = 5
Rows = Total number of pens / Number of pens per row
= 30 / 5
= 6
So, she can make 6 rows."

D) She will have 6 pens in each row. (0 marks)"
Response:  If she has 35 packages of pencils and each package contains 4 pencils, then she has a total of 35 x 4 = 140 pencils. Since she wants to put each row with 2 pencils in it, she can make 140 / 2 = 70 rows. So, she can make 70 rows.
Response:  If she has 31 packages of pencils and each package contains 6 pencils, then the total number of pencils is: 31 x 6 = 186 pencils. So, there are 186 pencils in total.
Response:  If she has 30 rows of pencils and each row has 71 wooden pencils and 24 metal pencils, then we can calculate as follows: Total number of wooden pencils = 71 x 30 = 2130 Wooden pencils Number of metal pencils = 24 / 30 = 8 Metal pencils Therefore, there are 2130 wooden pencils and 8 metal pencils in total.
"Response:  If she has 16 rows of pens and each row has 6 pencils and 21 pens, then we have:
Total number of pencils = 16 x 6 = 96
Total number of pens = 16 x 21 = 356
So, she has 96 pencils and 356 pens."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Number of students = Total number of classes x Number of students per class
= 21 classes x 30 students/class (assuming each class has 30 students)
= 630 students
Step 2: Calculate the total number of seats available in all school buses.
Total number of seats = Number of school buses x Number of seats per bus
= 7 buses x 50 seats/bus (assuming each bus has 50 seats)
= 350 seats
Now, we have to find out how many students can fit in each bus.
Step 3: Divide the total number of seats available in the buses by the total number of students to get the number of students that can fit in one bus.
Number of students per bus = Total number of seats / Total number of students
= 350 seats / 630 students
= 0.56 or approximately 1/2
So, approximately 1/2 of the 630 students can fit in each school bus."
"Response:  We know that there are 84 classrooms in the school and each classroom can accommodate 30 students (as assumed). Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:

Number of classrooms = 84
Capacity of each classroom = 30 students
Total number of students = Number of classrooms x Capacity per classroom
= 84 x 30
= 2520 students
So, there are approximately 2520 students in the school."
"Response:  We know that there are 67 classrooms in total and each classroom has 66 students. If each school bus can accommodate 6 passengers, then we need to calculate how many trips the school will make to transport all the students. To do this, divide the number of students (66) by the capacity of each school bus (6). So, the number of trips required is:

66 / 6 = 11

Therefore, the school needs 11 school buses to transport all the students for the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 87 classrooms in the school and each classroom has an equal number of students (58). So, we can assume that each classroom has 58/87 = 0.67 students per classroom on average. Since there are 2 seats in each school bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats available in each bus to find out how many buses are needed. Therefore, the required number of school buses is: Total Number of Students / Number of Seats per Bus = 58 x 0.67 = 39 buses.
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that there are 24 classrooms in the school.
Step 2: Each classroom has an equal number of students, so the total number of students in all classrooms is 24 x 120 = 2880.
Step 3: Since each student can fit in one seat on the bus, and there are 84 seats per bus, we can divide the total number of students by 84 to find out how many buses the school needs: 2880 / 84 = 35 buses.
Therefore, there are 35 buses in total.
Now, let's calculate the number of students in each bus: 35 buses x 84 seats per bus = 2960 students per bus.
So, there are 2960/120 = 24 students in each bus."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students participating in the field trip.
Total number of students = Number of classes x Total number of students per class
= 66 classes x 102 students/class
= 6920 students
Step 2: Calculate the number of students who do not want to participate in the field trip.
Number of students not participating = Total number of students - 22 students
= 6920 students - 22 students
= 6898 students
Step 3: Calculate the number of school buses needed for the field trip based on the number of non-participating students.
Number of school buses needed = Total number of non-participating students / Capacity of each school bus
= 6898 students / 8 seats/bus
= 874 buses
Therefore, the school needs 874 school buses for the field trip."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Total number of students = Number of classes x Number of students per class
= 102 x 11
= 1132 students
Step 2: Calculate the number of students who will attend the field trip.
Number of students attending the field trip = Total number of students - Number of students not attending the field trip
= 1132 - 8
= 1124 students
Therefore, 1124 students will participate in the field trip."
Response:  We know that there are 72 classrooms in total and each school bus can carry 3 students at most. So we need to calculate how many trips of school buses will be needed for this field trip. To do so, we divide the number of classrooms by the capacity of one school bus: Number of trips = Total number of classrooms / Capacity of one school bus = 72 / 3 = 24 trips Therefore, 24 school buses will be needed for this field trip.
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in each class.
Since there are 17 classes, and each class has 30 students (on average), we have:
Total number of students = 17 x 30 = 510 students.
Step 2: Calculate the total number of seats available in all school buses.
Since there are 46 school buses, and each bus has an average capacity of 60 passengers (as assumed), we have:
Total number of seats = 46 x 60 = 2760 seats.
Now, let's calculate the number of students who can go for the field trip based on the available seats in the school buses:
Number of students who can go for the field trip = Total number of students / Total number of seats = 510 students / 2760 seats = 0.187 or approximately 19 students per bus."
Response:  If Haley gives each of the 11 male students 9 marbles each, then she will give away a total of 9 x 11 = 99 marbles. So, Haley has 99 - 11 = 88 marbles left.
"Response:  If Haley has 10 marbles and she gives each boy 5 marbles, then...

Step 1: How many boys are there in total?
Total number of boys = Number of male students in Haley's class
= Given in the question
= 4

Step 2: How many marbles does Haley give to each boy?
Number of marbles given to each boy = Total number of marbles / Number of boys
= 10 marbles / 4 boys
= 2.5 marbles per boy (round down to nearest whole number)

So, Haley gives 2.5 marbles to each of the 4 boys. In total, she gives 10 marbles to the 4 boys."
Response:  If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 for herself, then she will have 23 - 15 = 8 marbles left. Since there are 4 boys in her class who like to play with marbles, each boy will get 8 / 4 = 2 marbles from Haley. Therefore, each boy will receive 2 marbles.
"Response:  If there are 13 boys who like playing marbles and each of them gets 4 marbles (since Haley has 26 marbles), then the total number of marbles distributed is:

13 x 4 = 52 marbles

Now, if there are 50 boys who like playing cards, and each of them gets 3 cards (since Haley has 26 cards), then the total number of cards distributed is:

50 x 3 = 150 cards

So, in total, Haley distributes 52 + 150 = 202 toys among the boys."
Response:  If there are 20 marbles and 2 boys in the class who like to play with them, then each boy will get 10 marbles (20 / 2 = 10).
Response:  If Haley has 28 marbles and wants to give each boy 2 marbles, then she will have to give out 14 marbles in total (2 x 7 = 14). So, she gave marbles to 7 boys.
Response:  The book has 392 pages and Frank reads 14 pages per day. To find out how many days it takes him to finish reading the book, we can divide the number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: Number of days = Total pages / Daily pages = 392 / 14 = 27 days So, Frank will take 27 days to read his favorite book.
Response:  We know that Frank reads 22 pages every day and it took him 569 days to finish reading the book. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of pages = Total number of days x Number of pages per day Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Number of pages = 569 x 22 Number of pages = 12380 pages Therefore, the book has 12380 pages.
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 6 days and the book has 612 pages. So, he must have read x pages per day, where x is a constant. Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the given conditions. Let's use the formula: Total pages / Number of days = Daily pages So, in this case, Total pages = 612 pages, and Number of days = 6 days. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: 612 / 6 = x pages/day Since Frank read the entire book in 6 days, we can say that x pages/day represents the number of pages Frank read each day. Therefore, the answer is x = 102 pages/day (612 pages / 6 days).
Response:  We know that Frank read the book for 220 days and the book has 555 pages. Since there are 5 chapters in total, each chapter must have a certain number of pages. Let's assume that each chapter has an equal number of pages, which is denoted as x. Then we can write the equation: Total pages = Number of chapters \* Number of pages per chapter So, Total pages = 5 \* x Now, we need to find out what value of x satisfies the given information. According to the question, Frank spent 220 days reading the book, which means he read at a rate of one chapter per day (assuming each chapter takes the same amount of time to read). Therefore, the number of days Frank spent reading each chapter is: Days spent reading each chapter = Total days / Number of chapters So, Days spent reading each chapter = 220 / 5 = 44 days Now, let's substitute this value into our earlier equation: Total pages = 5 \* x Total pages = 5x And since Frank took 220 days to read 555 pages, we can set up the following proportion: 5x = 555 5x / 5 = 111pages/chapter Now, we know that each chapter has x pages, so we can write: Chapter pages = x Now, we have two equations: 1. Total pages = 5x 2. Chapter pages = x To solve for x, we can use substitution or elimination method. Using substitution method, we get: x = 111pages/chapter ∴ Each chapter has 111 pages Solution: The value of x is 111 pages per chapter.
Response:  We know that Frank read this book for 660 days and there are 15 chapters in total. So, each chapter takes him how many days to finish? $$ \therefore \frac{Total pages}{Number of chapters} = \frac {193}{15} = 12.2 days $$ Now, we need to find out how many chapters Frank reads per day. Since he finished reading the book in 660 days, we can calculate it as follows: $$ \therefore \frac {Chapters read per day}{Days taken to finish the book} = \frac {15}{660} = 0.023 $$ Therefore, Frank reads 2.3 chapters per day.
"Response:  If Frank reads $n$ pages per day, then he will finish reading all $m$ books in $\frac{m}{n}$ days. Since he finished reading all books in 3 days, we have:
$$\frac{m}{n} = \frac{249}{d}$$
where $d$ is the number of pages Frank read per day. Solving for $n$, we get:
$$n = \frac{249}{d}$$
Therefore, Frank read $16$ pages per day ($249 / 16 = 16$)."
Response:  If Frank spent 12 days reading each book, then he read $ \text {number of books} \times 12 \text{ days} = 784 \text{ pages} $ in total. Since there are 66 pages per book, we can find out how many books Frank read as follows: $\frac{\text{total number of pages}}{\text{pages per book}} = \frac{784}{\times 66} = 11 \text{ books}$ So, Frank read $11$ books.
Response:  If Frank spent 16 days reading his favorite book and it has 112 pages, then he read for how many hours per day? We can calculate this as follows: Time taken to finish the book = Number of pages / Reading time per day = 112 / 16 = 7 pages per day. So, Frank reads 7 pages per day.
Response:  If Frank reads 8 pages every day, it means he will finish reading the book in (576/8) = 72 days. So, Frank needs 72 days to read his favorite book completely.
Response:  The book has 41 chapters and each chapter has 450 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is 41 x 450 = 17650 pages. Since Frank took 30 days to read the book, he read a certain number of pages per day. To find out how many pages he read per day, we can divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took him to read it: 17650 pages / 30 days = 585 pages per day.
Response:  We know that Frank read this book for 607 days and each chapter has 594 pages. So, we can calculate the number of pages in each chapter as follows: Number of pages in each chapter = Total number of pages / Number of chapters Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is: 594 pages / 3 chapters = 198 pages per chapter Now, let's check our answer: Is it correct?
Response:  We know that Frank read this book for 664 days and there are two chapters in the book. So, each chapter must have taken him how many days to finish? $$ \therefore \text{Number of days taken to finish one chapter} = {664 \div 2} = 332 \days $$ Now, we know that each chapter has $405$ pages, so the number of pages Frank read per day is: $$ \therefore \text{Number of pages read per day} = {405 \div 332} = 1.27 \pages/day $$ 
"Response:  If $6$ packages of DVD cost $120$, then we can calculate the price per package as follows:
$$ \frac{120}{6} = 20 $$
So each package of DVD costs $20$."
"Response:  If each package costs $81, then buying 33 packages of DVD will cost:
$81 x 33 = $2693
Therefore, buying 33 packages of DVD will require $2693."
Response:  The price of each DVD packaging box is $107. If there is a discount of $106, then we can buy how many boxes with $93? To solve this problem, let X be the number of boxes that can be bought with $93. We know that the cost of one box is $107 - $106 = $1. So, if we want to find out how many boxes can be bought with $93, we need to divide $93 by $1: X = $93 / $1 = 93 boxes. Therefore, you can buy 93 boxes with $93.
"Response:  The price of each DVD packaging box is $76. If there is a discount of $25 for each package, then we need to calculate how much money we will pay for each package after applying the discount. So, the amount we pay for each package = $76 - ($25 x number of packages) =?

Now, let's find out the number of packages we can buy with the given budget of $100. We know that the total cost of buying all these packages = $100. Therefore, the cost per package = $100 / number of packages =?

So, the answer is:
Amount paid for each package = $76 - ($25 x number of packages) = $51
Number of packages you can buy with $100 = $100 / $51 = 2"
"Response:  If you have $104 and each DVD costs $26, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many dollars are available for buying DVDs.
$104 - $26 = $78
Step 2: Determine how many DVDs can be bought with the available money.
$78 / $26 = 3
So, you can buy 3 packages of DVDs."
Response:  If $28 can buy 2 packages of DVDs, then each package must cost $\$14$.
"Response:  If we have 18 strawberries and want to divide them into groups of 2 each, how many groups can we make?

18 / 2 = 9
So there are 9 groups of 2 strawberries each."
Response:  If Philip has 140 groups of bananas and each group contains 187 bananas, then he has a total number of bananas equal to 140 x 187 = 23,690 bananas in his collection!
Response:  If there are 203 strawberries and 63 oranges in Philip's collection, then the total number of items is 203 + 63 = 266. Now, if we divide the strawberries into 7 groups, each group will have how many strawberries? So, the number of strawberries in each group is 266 / 7 = 38. Therefore, each group has 38 strawberries. Similarly, if we divide the oranges into 95 groups, each group will have how many oranges? So, the number of oranges in each group is 63 / 95 = 0.66. Therefore, each group has approximately 0.66 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 142 oranges and 356 orange segments. If we divide the oranges into 178 groups of equal size, each group will have how many oranges? So, the answer is 178 x 1 = 178.
Response:  If Philip has 392 total sticks of incense and he divided them into 196 groups, then each group must have an equal number of sticks. Therefore, we can write this equation: $numberOfSticksInEachGroup = 392 / 196$ So, there are $\boxed{2}$ sticks in each group.
Response:  If Philip has 180 sticks of incense and he wants to divide them into groups of 18 each, then we can calculate the number of groups as follows: Number of groups = Total number of sticks / Number of sticks in each group = 180 / 18 = 10 groups So there are 10 groups of incense that Philip has.
Response:  We know that there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into two groups of equal size, each group will have 145 bananas (290 / 2 = 145). Now, if we divide the oranges into 93 sets of bananas, each set will contain 9 oranges (87 / 9 = 9). So, each group of bananas has 145 bananas and each set of oranges contains 9 oranges.
Response:  We know that there are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If we divide the bananas into 345 groups of 1 banana each, then we have 345 bananas left over. Now, if we divide the oranges into 16 groups of x oranges each, then we have 16x oranges left over. So, the value of x is 16. Therefore, each group of bananas has 345/16 = 22 bananas, and each group of oranges has 16x = 240 oranges.
"Response:  If her mother prepared 38 pieces of bread for guests and each piece has 19 slices, then...

Response:  If Brenda made 5 people bread, and she prepared 22 pieces of bread but threw away 17 pieces, then there are 5 x 22 = 110 pieces of bread in total. So each person got 110 / 5 = 22 pieces of bread.
Response:  If Brenda made 18 pieces of bread for 10 guests and only 9 guests came, then each guest received how many pieces of bread? We can calculate this as follows: Number of guests = 9 Total number of pieces of bread = 18 Pieces of bread per guest = 18 / 9 = 2 So each guest received 2 pieces of bread from Brenda.
"Response:  If Brenda's mom made 14 cookies for 2 guests, then each guest will have how many cookies? We can divide 14 by 2 to get the number of cookies per person: 

14 / 2 = 7

So, each guest will have 7 cookies."
"Response:  If Brenda's mom prepared 10 pieces of bread for guests and each guest ate 2 slices, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices eaten by all guests.
Total number of slices = Number of guests x Number of slices per guest
= 10 guests x 2 slices/guest
= 20 slices

Step 2: Now, calculate the number of remaining slices that Brenda's mom has.
Remaining slices = Total number of slices - Number of slices eaten by guests
= 20 slices - 20 slices (since all guests ate 2 slices each)
= 0 slices (Brenda's mom has none left)

Therefore, Brenda's mom prepared bread for 0 positions."
Response:  If Frank has 42 pieces of candy and he wants to divide them into two bags, each bag will have how many pieces? We can calculate this as follows: Number of pieces in one bag = Total number of pieces / Number of bags So, if we want to find out how many pieces are in each bag, we need to divide the total number of pieces (42) by the number of bags (2). Therefore, each bag contains 42/2 = 21 pieces of candy.
"Response:  If Frank has 26 bags of candy and each bag contains 33 pieces of candy, then he has a total of:

26 x 33 = 878 pieces of candy."
"Response:  
Frank has 33 pieces of candy initially. 
He loses 24 pieces of candy, so he is left with 9 pieces of candy. 
To put it in bags with 9 candies each, Frank will need to use 10 bags (since 9 x 10 = 90). 
So, Frank will have 10 bags."
Response:  If Frank has 22 pieces of candy and he puts each piece in a bag, then he will have 22/11 = 2 bags. Therefore, Frank will have 2 bags.
Response:  If Frank puts equal amounts of sugar into two bags, then each bag will have half of the total amount of sugar. So, if he has 16 pieces of sugar initially, and he divides them equally between two bags, then each bag will contain 8 pieces of sugar (half of 16).
"Response:  If 雪莉 sold 25 boxes of waffles and each box has 14 packets, then...
Step 1: Calculate how many packets of waffles Snowy sold in total.
Total number of packets = Number of boxes x Number of packets per box
= 25 x 14
= 350 packets
Now we know that Snowy sold 350 packets of waffles."
Response:  If Snow White sold 10 boxes of children's military chocolates and she needs to send out 5 boxes, then... (1) x (5/10) = 2.5 boxes. So there are 2.5 boxes of chocolates that Snow White needs to send out.
Response:  The total number of bottles of water is 67 + 9 = 76. So, there are 76 bottles of regular soda water and 9 bottles of healthy soda water. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda water that exceeds the number of bottles of healthy soda water is 76 - 9 = 67.
Response:  The total number of bottles of water is 22 + 61 = 83 bottles. So, there are 83 - 22 = 61 more bottles of healthy water than regular water.
Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the number of regular soda water bottles and the number of healthy soda water bottles. So we can write an equation as follows: Total Number of Bottles = Number of Regular Soda Water Bottles + Number of Healthy Soda Water Bottles. Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total Number of Bottles = 30 + 8 = 38. Therefore, there are 38 bottles in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 79 bottles of regular soda water and 53 bottles of unsweetened soda water in total. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Total number of bottles = 79 + 53 = 132
Now, let's find out how many more bottles of regular soda water there are than unsweetened soda water:
More bottles of regular soda water = Total number of regular soda water - Number of unsweetened soda water
= 132 - 53
= 80
So, there are 80 more bottles of regular soda water than unsweetened soda water."
Response:  The total number of bottles of water is 54 + 83 = 137 bottles. Since there are 12 apples, we can assume that each apple takes up one bottle space. Therefore, the number of bottles of water per apple is 137 / 12 = 11 bottles per apple. So, the number of bottles of regular soda water is 83 - 11 = 72 bottles.
Response:  We know that there are 17 bottles of drink in total and 9 of them are ordinary soda water. So, the number of bottles of healthy soda water is 17 - 9 = 8. Therefore, they have 8 bottles of healthy soda water.
Response:  The total number of bottles of both types is 19 + 60 = 79 bottles. So, to find out how many more bottles of regular soda water there are than healthy soda water, we can divide the number of regular soda water bottles by the number of healthy soda water bottles: 60 / 19 = 3.26 (round up to 3). Therefore, there are 3 more bottles of regular soda water than healthy soda water.
Response:  The total number of bottles is 72 + 32 = 104 bottles. So, there are more than 104 bottles if they have 78 apples. Therefore, the difference between the total number of bottles and the number of apples is 104 - 78 = 26 bottles.
Response:  The total number of items in the store is 36 + 80 + 54 = 160. So, there are 160 - 36 = 124 bottles and cans more than apples.
Response:  We know that there are 30 bottles of drink in total and 28 of them are regular soda water. So, the number of bottles of sparkling water is 28 - 28 = 0. Therefore, there are no bottles of sparkling water.
Response:  If they have 4 bottles of healthy water and want to compare it with 79 bottles of regular water, then we can assume that each bottle of regular water is equal to 1/79th of the total amount of regular water. So, if they have x bottles of healthy water, then they have 79x/79 = x bottles of regular water. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular water is x = 4.
"Response:  The total number of bottles is equal to the sum of the numbers of each type of water. So we can write an equation as follows:
Total Number of Bottles = Number of Regular Sparkling Water + Number of Healthy Sparkling Water + Number of Light Sparkling Water
From the problem statement, we know that there are 57 bottles of regular sparkling water, 26 bottles of healthy sparkling water, and 27 bottles of light sparkling water. Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation as follows:
Total Number of Bottles = 57 + 26 + 27
Total Number of Bottles = 100
So, there are 100 bottles in total."
Response:  The total number of bottles is 81 + 60 + 60 = 201 bottles. Now, we know that 81 bottles are ordinary soda water and 60 bottles are lightly carbonated soda water. So, the difference between the two types is 81 - 60 = 21 bottles. Therefore, there are 21 more bottles of lightly carbonated soda water than ordinary soda water.
Response:  The total number of bottles of water = 49 + 40 + 6 = 135 bottles. So there are 135 bottles of ordinary tap water and 135 bottles of healthy spring water.
"Response:  If there were 295 visitors yesterday and today there are 317 visitors, then the increase in number of visitors is:

317 - 295 = 22

So, there are 22 more visitors today than there were yesterday."
"Response: 
Day 1: 703 visitors
Day 2: 246 visitors (including the two friends)
Total number of days = 25 days
So, total number of visitors = Total number of days x Number of visitors per day
= 25 x 246
= 6,150 visitors
Therefore, during the 25-day period, approximately 6,150 people visited Buckingham Palace."
"Response:  If there were 100 visitors yesterday and 666 today, then the difference between the two days is:

$$ \text{Difference} = 666 - 100 = 566 $$

So, there are $566$ more visitors today than yesterday."
"Response: 
We know that in the past 327 days, there were 406 people who visited the White Gold Palace. This means that on average, about 1.25 people visited the palace per day (406 / 327 = 1.25).
Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the palace yesterday. We are told that 132 people visited the palace after they finished their meal. So, we can calculate the number of visitors yesterday as follows:
Number of visitors yesterday = Total number of visitors x Percentage of visitors who came yesterday
= 406 x 132/327
= 406 x 0.40
= 163
Therefore, 163 people visited the White Gold Palace yesterday."
"Response:  We know that in the past 85 days, 829 people have visited the White Gold Palace. And today, there are 45 visitors. So, we need to find out how many times 829 is divided by 45. 
Division formula: dividend / divisor = quotient x remainder
In this case, the dividend is 829 and the divisor is 45. Therefore, the quotient is 17 (829 ÷ 45 = 17). The remainder is 3 (17 × 3 = 3). 
So, there were 17 groups of 45 people who visited the White Gold Palace in the past 85 days."
"Response: 
Day 1: 188 visitors
Day 2: 557 - 188 = 369 new visitors
Total number of visitors in 57 days = 188 + 369 = 557
Therefore, 557 people visited the palace during those 57 days."
"Response:  If there were 600 visitors yesterday and today there are 661 visitors, then the difference between the two days is:

661 - 600 = 61

So, today there are 61 more visitors than yesterday."
"Response: 
Day 1: 419 visitors
Day 2: 103 visitors + 92 visitors = 195 visitors
So, in total, there were 419 + 195 = 614 visitors to the palace before that day."
"Response: 
Day 1: 471 visitors
Day 2: 512 - 471 = 41 visitors
Day 3: 808 - 471 = 337 visitors
Total number of visitors in past 89 days: 41 + 337 = 378 visitors
Therefore, there were 378 people who visited the White Gold Palace in the past 89 days."
"Response: 
Day 1: 191 visitors
Day 2: 705 - 191 = 514 additional visitors
So, in total, there are 514 + 457 = 971 visitors over the past 245 days."
Response:  If he already has 159 grams of wax and needs 628 grams in total for his list, then he still needs 469 grams (628 - 159 = 469) more wax. So, he currently has 159/469 = 33% of the total amount of wax needed.
"Response:  We know that he needs to paint with 49 grams of coloring material and currently has 260 grams of wax left. So we can calculate how much wax is left as follows:

Total amount of wax needed = Amount of wax needed for painting + Amount of wax already used (for previous paintings)
= 288 grams (as stated in the problem) - 260 grams (amount of wax already used)
= 128 grams

Therefore, he has 128 grams of wax left."
Response:  We know that he needs to paint with 57 grams of coloring material and also has 22 grams of wax. If the feathers need 353 grams of wax, how much does he already have? So, he has 353 - 57 = 296 grams of wax left.
Response:  If he needs 166 grams of wax to stick feathers and he currently has only 20 grams, then he still needs 146 grams (166 - 20) more wax. So, he needs 146 / 20 = 7.3 grams more wax.
"Response:  If he had 557 grams of wax and now needs only 17 grams, then we can calculate how much less wax he needs as follows:

557 - 17 = 540 grams

So, the bird needs 540 grams of wax."
Response:  If he currently has 11 grams of wax and needs a total of 492 grams for all his feathers, then he will need (492 - 11) = 481 grams more wax. So, he needs 481 grams more wax.
"Response:  The farmer was informed that he would be able to harvest 90 grapes per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of grapes that will be harvested as follows:
Total number of grapes = Number of grapes per day x Number of days
= 90 grapes/day x 7 days
= 630 grapes
Therefore, the farmer will harvest 630 grapes per day."
"Response:  The farmer was informed that he had harvested 266 grapes per day for 5 days. So, in total, he has harvested 266 x 5 = 1330 grapes. Since each grape is equivalent to one ""鼓"" (a unit of measurement), the farmer has collected 1330 grapes / 鼓 = 1330/10 = 133鼓. Therefore, the farmer collects approximately 133鼓 of grapes every day."
"Response:  The total number of days is 146 and each day they harvest 244 grapes per vineyard. So, in one day, they will harvest 
$$ \text {Total no. of grape} = \text{No. of vines} \times \text{Grape per vine} $$
= 294 $\times$ 244 = 70,536 grapes per day.
Now, let's calculate the total number of grape jars that can be filled in 146 days:
$$\text{Total no. of jar} = \frac{\text{Total no. of grape}}{ \text{Jar capacity}} $$
= $\frac{70536}{100}$ = $705360$ grape jars.
Therefore, the total number of grape jars that can be filled in 146 days is $705360$."
"Response:  The farmer is told that he will be able to harvest 235 workers every day and each worker can fill 100 barrels or 221 barrels of grapes per day. Therefore, in total, the farmer will be able to harvest 
$$ \text {Total number of barrels} = \text{Number of workers} \times \text{Amount of grape per worker} $$
$$\text{Total number of barrels} = 235 \times 100 = 23500 \barrels $$
Therefore, the farmer will be able to harvest $ 23500$ barrels of grapes in $ 77 $ days."
Response:  If he visited 57 sites and then stopped, it means that in total, he inspected 57 x 2 = 114 stations. And each station has 108 grape barrels per day, so in total, he would have filled 114 x 108 = 12368 grape barrels per day. Therefore, in 58 days, he will fill 12368 x 58 = 719768 grape barrels.
"Response:  If he needs to fill 240 baskets of grapes, and each basket can hold 8 grapes, then we need to know how many days it will take him to fill all those baskets. So, we divide the total number of grapes (240) by the number of grapes he can fill per day (8):

Number of days = Total number of grapes / Number of grapes per day
= 240 / 8
= 30 days
Therefore, it will take him 30 days to fill all 240 baskets of grapes."
"Response:  We know that there are total 52 saltwater animals in all the aquariums together. And each aquarium has the same number of saltwater animals. So, if we divide 52 by the number of aquariums (which is given as 3), we get the number of saltwater animals in each aquarium:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ saltwater\ animals\ in\ each\ aquarium = \frac{52}{3} = 17 $$
So, there are 17 saltwater animals in each of the 3 aquariums."
Response:  If he has 40 sea creatures in total and each aquarium can hold 2 sea creatures, then... (1) There are 40 / 2 = 20 aquariums.
Response:  We know that Taylor has 56 saltwater aquariums and each aquarium contains 39 fishes. So, in total, he has 56 x 39 = 2174 fishes of saltwater species.
Response:  We know that Taylor has 74 aquatic animals in total and each tank contains 46 animals. So there are 74 x 46 = 3308 animals in all tanks combined. Since some of these animals are freshwater, we can assume that at least half of them (168) are saltwater animals. Therefore, Taylor has at least 3308 / 2 = 1654 saltwater animals.
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that there are 15 saltwater aquariums and each has 19 fishes inside it. So, the total number of fish in saltwater aquariums is:
15 x 19 = 285
Step 2: Now we know that there are 62 freshwater aquariums and each has an average of 3 fishes inside it (as given in the question). So, the total number of fish in freshwater aquariums is:
62 x 3 = 186
Step 3: Therefore, the total number of fish in both saltwater and freshwater aquariums is:
285 + 186 = 471
So, the person has 471 fishes in their aquarium collection."
"Response:  If white T-shirts can be bought in packages of 13 pieces each, then...

If mum buys 39 white T-shirts, she will have:

39 / 13 = 3 packets
So, mum will have 3 packets of white T-shirts."
"Response:  If Mom buys 66 white T-shirts and each package contains 3 white T-shirts, then...

1. How many packages of white T-shirts does Mom buy?

Mom buys 66 white T-shirts, so she buys 66 / 3 = 22 packages of white T-shirts.

Therefore, Mom has 22 packages of white T-shirts."
Response:  If mom bought 28 packages of white T-shirts and each package contains 56 white T-shirts, then we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = Total number of white T-shirts / Number of white T-shirts in each package 28 packages = (56 x) / 56 White T-shirts per package In this case, there are 56 white T-shirts in each package, so we can simplify the equation to get the total number of white T-shirts: Total number of white T-shirts = 56 x 28 = 1492 white T-shirts Therefore, if Mom buys 28 packages of white T-shirts, she will have a total of 1492 white T-shirts.
"Response:  If 53 pieces of white T-shirts can be bought in one package, then the number of packages needed to buy 57 pieces is:

$$ \frac{57}{53} = 1.06 $$
So, Mom needs to buy $1\text{.06$}$ times more packages than she would need to buy if she were buying them individually. Therefore, she will have:

$$ 1.06 \times 53 = 55 $$
white T-shirts.

Now, let's calculate how many pants she will get:

$$ \frac{34}{53} = 0.64 $$
So, Mom will get $0\text{.64$}$ times fewer packages of pants than she would get if she were buying them individually. Therefore, she will have:

$$ 0.64 \times 34 = 21 $$
pairs of pants."
Response:  If white T-shirts can be bought in 3 pieces per package, then the number of packages = total quantity / number of pieces per package. In this case, the total quantity is 51 and we want to find out how many packages she will buy. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of packages = 51 / 3 = 17 packages. Therefore, her mother will buy 17 packages of white T-shirts.
"Response:  If mom bought 70 white T-shirts in total and she bought them in packages of 14, then each package contains:
70 / 14 = 5 packages
So, there are 5 packages of white T-shirts that mom bought. Each package contains 70/5 = 14 white T-shirts."
Response:  If you have 4 bags and each bag has an equal number of cookies, then the total number of cookies is 36 (since there are 36 cookies in total). Since there are 4 bags, each bag must contain 9 cookies ( since 36 / 4 = 9).  Therefore, each bag contains 9 cookies.
"Response:  If you have 33 blocks of crackers and each bag contains 11 blocks, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bags of crackers.
Total number of bags = Total number of blocks / Number of blocks in each bag
= 33 / 11
= 3 bags

Therefore, you have 3 bags of crackers."
Response:  If each bag has 41 pieces of crackers and you have 53 bags, then the total number of pieces of crackers is: 53 x 41 = 2193. So, there are 2193 pieces of crackers in total.
Response:  If you have 14 pieces of bread and 7 bags, then each bag contains how many pieces of bread? We can divide 14 by 7 to find out that each bag contains 2 pieces of bread. So, there are 2 pieces of bread in each bag.
Response:  If every bag has 3 biscuits and you have 21 biscuits in total, then... (1) x = 21 / 3 = 7 bags of biscuits. Therefore, there are 7 bags of biscuits.
Response:  If you have 15 pieces of candy and 52 pieces of bread, then each piece of bread has how many candies? 🍰🍫 $15 / 52 = 0.275 $ So, there are approximately 30 bread bags (rounded up from 0.275 to the nearest whole number). Therefore, you have 30 bread bags.
Response:  We know that there are 14 bags of cookies and each bag has an equal number of cookies. So, we can say that the total number of cookies in all the bags is 14 x Number of Cookies per Bag = 14 x 5 = 70 cookies. Now, we also know that there are 28 pieces of chocolate. Since each piece of chocolate costs $0.50, the total cost of all the chocolates is 28 x $0.50 = $14. Therefore, the ratio of cookies to chocolates is 70 : 14 = 5 : 2. So, if you have 14 bags of cookies, you will have 5 bags of chocolates.
"Response:  If an mailman must send 5 pieces of junk mail to each street and there are n streets in total, then he will have to send 5n pieces of junk mail in total. 
If he sends 25 pieces of junk mail to every house in each street, then he will have sent a total of 25n pieces of junk mail. 
So, we can set up the equation:  5n = 25n  Solving for n, we get: n = 5  Therefore, there are 5 streets in total."
Response:  If there are $n$ houses in total and each house receives $k$ pieces of trash mail, then the number of trash letters sent to each street is $\frac{kn}{20}$. Therefore, the total number of trash letters sent is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{ik}{20}$, where $n$ is the total number of houses. 
Response:  If there are 6 houses in one street and each mailman needs to deliver 24 pieces of trash mail to each house, then the total number of pieces of trash mail that each mailman will need to deliver is 6 x 24 = 144 pieces. Therefore, each mailman will need to deliver 144 pieces of trash mail per street.
Response:  If there are $n$ households in the street and the mailman delivers $2$ pieces of junk mail to each household, then the total number of pieces of junk mail delivered is $\text{2} \times n$. Since the mailman delivers $14$ pieces of junk mail overall, we can set up the equation: $\text{2} \times n = 14$. Solving for $n$, we get $n = 7$. Therefore, there are $7$ households in the street.
"Response:  If there are 20 houses in one street and each house needs to receive 32 pieces of trash mail, then the total number of pieces of trash mail for that street is:

20 houses x 32 pieces/house = 640 pieces of trash mail

So, the delivery person should deliver 640 pieces of trash mail to that street."
"Response: 
Step 1: The total number of street areas is 78.
Step 2: Each street area needs 30 trash letters.
Step 3: Therefore, the total number of trash letters needed = Total number of street areas x Number of trash letters per street area = 78 x 30 = 2340 trash letters.
Therefore, the mailman should give each household in a street area 2340 / 19 = approximately 125 trash letters."
"Response: 
Given that there are 55 street areas and each area has 8 trash mailboxes, we need to find out how many houses are in each street area.
If the postman delivers 32 letters to each house, then he will deliver a total of 32 x 55 = 1760 letters.
So, if there are X houses in each street area, then the number of letters delivered to each house is 1760 / X.
Now, we can set up an equation based on this information:
1760 = 1760X
Solving for X, we get:
X = 1760 / 32
X = 55
Therefore, there are 55 houses in each street area."
Response:  If there are 81 total houses to deliver mail to and each house has 4 pieces of trash mail, then we need to deliver 81 x 4 = 324 pieces of trash mail in total. Since there are 12 houses per street, we can divide the total number of pieces of trash mail by 12 to find out how many pieces of trash mail each street has: 324 / 12 = 26 pieces of trash mail for each street. Therefore, the postman needs to deliver 26 pieces of trash mail to each of the 12 streets.
Response:  Since there are 16 street districts and each district has 4 trash mailboxes to deliver, we need to calculate how many trash mailboxes he needs to deliver in total. Therefore, the number of trash mailboxes he needs to deliver is 16 x 4 = 64.
"Response:  If we want to create groups of 4 each, and Rebecca has 10 eggs and 20 marbles, then...

Step 1: We can use all 10 eggs to make 10 groups of 4 marbles each (since there are only 20 marbles). So, the first group will have 4 marbles from the remaining 16 marbles.

Step 2: After using 10 eggs, we have 10 - 10 = 0 eggs left, and we still have 20 marbles left. Now, we can use these 20 marbles to make another 5 groups of 4 marbles each (since there are now 20 marbles available). So, the second group will have 4 marbles from the remaining 16 marbles again.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until all marbles are used up or no more eggs are left. Since there are only 20 marbles, it means that after making 5 groups of 4 marbles each, we will run out of marbles. Therefore, the total number of groups created is 5.

So, the answer is 5."
Response:  If we want to divide 15 eggs into groups of 5 each, how many groups can we make? We can make 3 groups (15 / 5 = 3). So, there will be 3 groups.
Response:  If there are x groups of 11 eggs each, then the total number of eggs is x \* 11 = 11x. Since Rebecca has to divide these eggs equally among herself and her friends, she will have (11x - 22) eggs left after dividing them into groups of 2 eggs per person. So, the answer is 11x - 22.
Response:  If we have 8 chicken eggs and want to divide them into 4 groups of equal size, each group will contain how many eggs? We can use division to find out! So, 8 ÷ 4 = 2. Therefore, each group will contain 2 chicken eggs.
Response:  If Rebecca wants to divide the eggs into 3 groups, each group will have how many eggs? So, we need to find out how many eggs are in total and then divide them equally among the three groups. Total number of eggs = Number of eggs / Group size Group size is given as 15 eggs per group, so Total number of eggs = 15 x 3 = 45 eggs Now, since there are 4 marbles, each group will have 45/4 = 11 eggs in it. Therefore, each group has 11 eggs.
"Response:  We need to divide the total number of items into groups of 6. So, we will have $ \frac {Total Number Of Items} {Number Of Items In Each Group} = 6 $ groups. 
Now, let's calculate the total number of items in each group:
$ Total Number Of Items / Number Of Items In Each Group = 18 / 6 = 3 $ groups for chicken eggs.
$ Total Number Of Items / Number Of Items In Each Group = 72 / 6 = 12 $ groups for bananas.
$ Total Number Of Items / Number Of Items In Each Group = 66 / 6 = 11 $ groups for marbles.
So, there will be $ 3 + 12 + 11 = 36 $ groups overall."
Response:  We need to divide the total number of items into groups of 3. So, we will have 99 / 3 = 33 groups of 3 items each. Now, let's count how many eggs and marbles are left over after forming these groups: Eggs: 9 - (3 x 33) = 0 Marbles: 27 - (3 x 33) = 16 Therefore, there will be 33 groups of 3 items each, with 0 eggs and 16 marbles left over.
Response:  If we divide 20 chicken eggs into groups of 5 each, then we will have 4 groups (20 / 5 = 4). Now, if we compare the number of chicken eggs with the number of marbles, we can see that Rebecca has 6 marbles and needs 14 more marbles to match the number of chicken eggs she has. So, Rebecca is short 14 marbles compared to the number of chicken eggs she has. Therefore, the difference between the number of chicken eggs and marbles is 14.
Response:  If we divide 12 eggs into groups of 20 each, then we will have 12/20 = 0.6 eggs left over after dividing them all up. Since Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs, that means she has 5 + 0.6 = 5.6 eggs in total. So, Rebecca has more than 3 times as many eggs as marbles (i.e., 5.6 - 5 = 0.6).
"Response:  If 卢克 (Luke) got 154 points in total, and he scored 11 points per round, then we can calculate the number of rounds as follows:

154 / 11 = 13

So Luke played 13 rounds in the game."
"Response:  If Luo Ku has played 177 rounds of the game and obtained 46 points each round, then he has scored a total of:

177 rounds x 46 points/round = 8,322 points
Therefore, Luo Ku has scored a total of 8,322 points in the game."
Response:  If Luo Ku got 84 points in total after playing two rounds of the game, and he scored equally well in each round, then he must have scored x points per round. Since there are two rounds, we can write an equation as follows: 84 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 42. So, Luo Ku scored 42 points per round.
Response:  If 卢克 won 146 points in each round of the game, then he won a total of 146 x 157 = 23,082 points in all rounds combined.
Response:  If 卢克 (Luke) got 78 points in total, and each round gives him 3 points, then he must have played x rounds. We can write this as an equation: 78 = 3x. Now we need to solve for x. To do that, divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 26. So Luke played 26 rounds in the game.
Response:  If Amelia can make 32 chains with 2 beads each, then she needs to have 64 beads in total (32 x 2 = 64). So, the answer is 64 beads.
Response:  If Amelia is making 11 chains and each chain requires 28 beads, then she needs a total of 28 x 11 = 308 beads. So, Amelia has 308 beads in total.
Response:  We know that Amelia has 16 beads and she needs to make at least 8 bead chains. So, we can start with making one chain first. Then, we will have 8 beads left over. Now, if we want to make another chain, we need 8 more beads, which means we need to use all of the remaining beads. Therefore, Amelia can make 2 chains in total.
"Response:  Since Amelia can make 18 chains, and each chain requires 6 beads, then the total number of beads she needs is:

18 x 6 = 108

So, Amelia needs 108 beads to make all 18 chains."
Response:  If Emily is making 4 chains and each chain needs 5 beads, then she will need 4 x 5 = 20 beads in total. So, Emily has 20 beads.
Response:  Since Ameli has 6 pearls and each chain requires 3 pearls, she can make 6 / 3 = 2 chains. Therefore, Ameli can make 2 chains.
Response:  Since Amelia has 5 pearls and can make 20 chains, each chain requires 5/20 = 1/4 of a pearl. So, one pearl will be used to make 4 chains. Therefore, Amelia needs 5 x 4 = 20 pearls to make all the chains she wants to give to her friends.
Response:  If Emily is making necklaces for her 44 friends and each necklace requires 2 pearls, then she needs to make 44 x 2 = 88 necklaces in total. Since she has already made 26 necklaces, there are still 62 necklaces left to be made. Therefore, Emily has 62 x 2 = 124 pearls remaining.
"Response: 
Let X be the number of children who went to summer camp from Lawrence County.
We know that X + 668278 = 819058 (total number of children in Lawrence County)
So, we can write an equation:
X + 668278 = 819058
Now let's solve for X:
X = 819058 - 668278
= 150830
Therefore, 150830 children from Lawrence County went to summer camp during the summer break."
"Response:  We know that there are 202958 children from Lawrence County who went to summer camp and 777622 children who stayed at home. So, we want to find out how many more children chose to stay at home than those who went to summer camp. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Number of children who stayed at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp

Now, let's plug in the values we know into the formula:

Number of children who stayed at home = 777622 - 202958
= 574664

So, there were 574664 more children who chose to stay at home than those who went to summer camp."
Response:  We know that there are 898051 children in total. If 629424 of them go to camp, then the number of children left behind is: 898051 - 629424 = 268627. So, 268627 children stay at home.
Response:  We know that there are 313473 children in the county and during summer vacation, 274865 of them stay at home. So, the number of children who went to summer camp is: 313473 - 274865 = 38609.
"Response: 
We know that there are 907611 children who stay at home during summer vacation in Lawrence County.
The total number of children is equal to the sum of those who stayed at home and those who went to summer camp. Therefore, we can write:
Number of children = Number of children who stayed at home + Number of children who went to summer camp
= 907611 + 455682
= 1363293
So, there are approximately 1363293 children in Lawrence County."
"Response:  We know that 800059 is the number of children who went to summer camp from Lawrence County. So, we can write an equation as follows:

Number of children left at home = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

Number of children left at home = 828521 - 800059
= 284662

Therefore, approximately 284,662 children stayed at home during the summer break."
Response:  We know that there are 61619 children who stayed at home during summer vacation from Lawrence County. The total population of Lawrence County is 91676 people. So, we can calculate the percentage of children who went to summer camp as follows: Percentage = (Number of children who went to summer camp / Total population) x 100% Number of children who went to summer camp = Total population - Number of children who stayed at home = 91676 - 61619 = 30057 Therefore, approximately 30057 children from Lawrence County went to summer camp.
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the number of children from LaRance County who went to summer camp.
Number of children from LaRance County = 34044
Step 2: Calculate the number of children left behind in LaRance County.
Number of children left behind in LaRance County = Total number of children - Number of children who went to summer camp
= 134867 - 34044
= 100823
Step 3: Calculate the total number of children who participated in summer camp including those from outside the county.
Total number of children participating in summer camp = Number of children from LaRance County + Number of children from other counties
= 34044 + 424944
= 458388
Therefore, there were 458388 children who participated in summer camp."
"Response:  According to the problem statement:

* 610769 students from LaRen County attended summer camp.
* 590796 students stayed at home in LaRen County.
* 22 students came from outside counties to attend summer camp.

So, the total number of students in LaRen County is:

610769 + 590796 = 1201065

Therefore, there are approximately 12 million children in LaRen County."
Response:  According to the question, there are 644,997 children from Lawrence County who stay at home during summer vacation. Additionally, 893,835 children go to summer camp. Finally, 78 children come from outside the county to attend summer camp. So, in total, there are (644,997 + 893,835) = 1,538,832 children from Lawrence County.
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jed has more than 3 times as many apples as Adam. So, if Jed has x apples, then Adam has 9/x apples. Now we know that Jed has at least 27 apples (since he has more than 3 times as many as Adam). Therefore, the answer is 27.
Response:  Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples. So, the total number of apples is 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, Adam has more than Jackie by 8 (12 - 4).
Response:  Adam has 9 apples and Jack has 10 apples. To find out how many more apples Jack has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jack has: Number of apples Jack has - Number of apples Adam has = 10 - 9 = 1. So, Jack has one more apple than Adam.
Response:  Jake has 10 apples and Adam has 8 apples. To find out how many more apples Jake has than Adam, we can subtract the number of apples Adam has from the number of apples Jake has: 10 - 8 = 2. So, Jake has 2 more apples than Adam.
Response:  Adam and Jack have 6 apples together. If they want to share them equally, each will get 3 apples (6 / 2 = 3). Now, there are 9 apples left (6 - 3 = 9), which means that another person can come and take 4 apples (9 / 4 = 2). So, in total, there are 5 people with 2 apples each (3 + 2 = 5).
"Response:  
Adam and Jack together have 7 apples. 
If they add 9 more apples, then Adam will have x apples, and Jack will have y apples, where x + y = 7 (given). 
Now, we can write an equation based on this information:
x + y = 7... (1)
We know that Adam has x apples, so he doesn't get any of the new apples. Therefore, the number of apples Jack gets is equal to the total number of new apples minus the number of apples Adam already had:
y = 9 - x... (2)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:
x + (9 - x) = 7
Simplifying, we get:
2x = 6
X = 3
So, Adam has 3 apples, and Jack has 6 apples."
Response:  Adam and Jack have 12 apples together. 9 more apples are shared equally between them, so each of them has 3 additional apples (9/2 = 4.5). Therefore, Adam has 10 + 4 = 14 apples, and Jack has 12 - 4 = 8 apples.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Adam has 4 apples and Jay has 10 apples. Together they have 2 apples. So, there are 6 more apples than what Adam has. Therefore, Adam has 6 + 4 = 10 apples.
Response:  Adam has more apples than Jaycee. So, if Adam has x apples, then Jaycee has less than or equal to x - 5 apples. Therefore, the number of apples that Adam has is 7 (since he has more than 5).
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 31 pieces of bread. Today, she baked 270 pieces in the morning and 419 pieces yesterday evening, for a total of 689 pieces. So, the number of bread pieces Helen baked before last night is 689 - 31 = 658 pieces.

Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 144 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 85 more. So, in total, Helen has baked 229 chocolate chip cookies. Now, let's find out how many pineapple rings she baked. According to the question, Helen baked 397 pineapple rings yesterday and today she baked 403 more. Therefore, in total, Helen has baked 800 pineapple rings.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies. Today, she baked 231 chocolate chip cookies and 237 chocolate chip cookies in total. So, the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies baked today and yesterday is: 231 - 19 = 212. Therefore, Helen baked 212 more chocolate chip cookies than pear-shaped cookie bars today compared to yesterday.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 197 chocolate chip cookies and 46 raisin cookies. Today, she baked 75 raisin cookies and 66 chocolate chip cookies. So, yesterday, she baked more chocolate chip cookies than today. The difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies baked yesterday and today is 66 - 46 = 20. Therefore, Helen baked 20 more chocolate chip cookies yesterday than today.
Response:  Yesterday, Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and today she baked 280 more. So, in total, Helen baked 799 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and today. Now, let's find out how many pineapple rings she baked yesterday compared to today. According to the question, Helen baked 300 pineapple rings yesterday and today she baked 359 more. So, the difference between the number of pineapple rings Helen baked yesterday and today is 359 - 300 = 59. Therefore, Helen baked 59 more pineapple rings today than she did yesterday.
Response:  Kati has 81 games and her friend has 59 games. So, the difference between them is: 81 - 59 = 22. Therefore, Kati has 22 more games than her friend.
Response:  Kati has 91 games, her new friend has 88 games, and her old friend has 53 games. So, in total, Kati has 91 + 88 + 53 = 232 games. Therefore, Kati's friends have a total of 232 games.
Response:  Kati has 78 new games and 86 old games, so she has a total of 164 games (78 + 86). Her friend has 48 new games, so her friend has a total of 48 games. Therefore, the combined number of new games owned by Kati and her friend is 164 + 48 = 212 games.
Response:  Kati has 84 new games and 19 old games, so she has a total of 103 games (84 + 19). Her friend has 8 new games and 69 old games, so her friend has a total of 77 games (8 + 69). Therefore, together they have 180 games (103 + 77).
Response:  Kati has 62 new games and 80 old games, so she has a total of 142 games (62 + 80). Her friend has 73 new games and 41 old games, so her friend has a total of 114 games (73 + 41). Since they have different numbers of both new and old games, their combined total number of old games is equal to the sum of their individual totals: 142 + 114 = 256. Therefore, Kati's friend has 256 old games.
Response:  According to the question, Katie has 63 DS games and her friends have 57 games in total. So, we need to find out how many more games Katie has than her friends. To do this, we can subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has: 63 - 57 = 6. Therefore, Katie has 6 more games than her friends.
Response:  Kati has 57 new games and 39 old games, so she has a total of 96 games (57 + 39 = 96). Her friend has 34 new games, so her friend has a total of 34 games. Therefore, Kati has more games than her friend by 62 games (96 - 34 = 62).
"Response:  
Jason had $19 at first and earned $24 from washing cars over the weekend (since he now has $33). So Jason earned $24 in total."
"Response: 
Fred had $86 last week and spent $9 on washing his car this week, so he now has $77 ($86 - $9).
Jason had $5 last week and didn't earn any money this week, so he still has $5.
The total amount of money they have together is $77 + $5 = $82."
"Response: 
Fred had $19 last week and earned $21 this week, so his new balance is $40.
Jason had $16 last week and earned $43 this week, so his new balance is $69.
So, Fred earned $21 - $19 = $2 more than Jason this week."
"Response:  
Fred had $114 last week and spent $30 on car wash. Now he has $84. 
Jason had $22 last week and earned $56 during the weekend. So now Jason has $78. 
Therefore, Jason earned $56 during the weekend."
"Response: 
Fred had $111 last week and spent $26 on washing his car ($111 - $26 = $85). Now he has $115.
Jason had $40 last week and sent $10 for newspapers ($40 - $10 = $30). Now he has $44.
So, Fred earned $35 from washing his car ($115 - $85 = $30), and Jason earned $24 from sending newspapers ($44 - $30 = $14)."
"Response: 
Fred had $49 last week and spent $11 on laundry, so he has $38 left ($49 - $11 = $38).
Jason had $3 last week and sent $20 to the newspaper, so he has $53 left ($3 + $20 = $53).
Now, let's calculate how much money they earned from sending newspapers:
Fred earned $20 (since he sent $20 and now has $38)
Jason earned $17 ($53 - $38 = $17)
So, Jason earned $17 and Fred earned $20."
"Response: 
Fred had $78 last week and Jason had $31 last week. After Jason sent the newspaper, he now has $14. So, Fred had $78 - $14 = $64 left.
Then, during the weekend, Fred earned $90 from washing cars. So, his new balance is $64 + $90 = $154.
Therefore, they earned $154."
"Response:  
Fred had $33 last week and earned $16 during the weekend for delivering newspapers. So his new balance is $33 + $16 = $49. 
Jason had $95 last week and earned $74 during the weekend for washing cars. So his new balance is $95 + $74 = $169."
"Response:  
Fred had $47 last week and earned $111 during the weekend for delivering newspapers. So his new balance is: $47 + $111 = $158. 
Jason had $99 last week and did not earn any money over the weekend. His current balance remains at $99. Therefore, Fred has $158 and Jason has $99."
Response:  At first, Jesse weighed 71 kg (kg). After running every day for some time, she lost 20 kg, so her current weight is: 71 kg - 20 kg = 51 kg. Therefore, Jesse currently weighs 51 kg.
"Response:  We know that Jesse currently weighs 27 kg and has lost 101 kg since starting to run slowly every day. So, her current weight minus the weight she lost is equal to her initial weight. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 27 - 101 = x Where ""x"" represents Jesse's initial weight before starting to run slowly every day. Now, let's solve for ""x"". To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the number of days she has been running slowly (which is 1 day in this case). So, we have: 27 - 101 = x / 1 ÷ 1 = x Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 34 kg This means that Jesse initially weighed 34 kg before starting to run slowly every day."
Response:  We know that Jesse lost 126 kg after starting to run every day. So her current weight is 66 kg - 126 kg = -60 kg. Since she started running before this, her pre-running weight must be greater than -60 kg. Therefore, her pre-running weight was -60 kg + x kg, where x is a positive number.
Response:  Jesse started running every day and lost 35 kg after starting. Before she started running, her weight was 69 kg. Now, her weight is x kg. We know that her current weight minus her initial weight equals the amount of weight she lost through running. So we can write an equation as follows: x - 69 = 35. Solving for x, we get: x = 74 kg. Therefore, Jesse's current weight is 74 kg.
Response:  At first, Jesse lost 50 kg in the first week and then lost another 60 kg in the second week. So, her weight after one week is 114 - 50 = 64 kg, and after two weeks it is 64 - 60 = 4 kg. Therefore, Jesse currently weighs 4 kg.
Response:  We know that Jesse started running at week 1 with weight loss of 62 kg and then in week 2 she lost another 140 kg. So her total weight loss is 62 + 140 = 202 kg. Now we need to find out what was her initial weight before starting to run. Let's assume her initial weight was x kg. Then we can write an equation based on the information given in the question: x - 202 = 9 (initial weight) Since Jesse's current weight is 9 kg, we can substitute this value in the above equation to get x = 211 kg. Therefore, Jesse's initial weight before starting to run was 211 kg.
Response:  The girl weighs 92 kg initially and loses weight at a rate of 56 g/day in the first week and 99 g/day in the second week. To find her weight after one week, we can use the formula: Weight = Initial weight x (1 - Daily loss) / Number of days. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Weight = 92 kg x (1 - 0.56 kg/day) / 7 days = 92 kg x 0.434 = 40.32 kg After one week, she has lost 40.32 kg or 89.9 pounds. Therefore, her weight after one week is 92 kg - 40.32 kg = 51.68 kg or 113.7 pounds.
Response:  We know that there are 95 snakes in total and 61 fish in total. If 64 of them hide, then we have: Snakes left = 95 - 64 = 31 Fish left = 61 - 0 = 61 Now, we can see that 31 snakes did not hide, so the answer is 31.
Response:  We know that there are 93 snakes and 97 fish in total. If 40 of them hide, then we have: Snakes left = 93 - 40 = 53 Fish left = 97 - 40 = 57 So, there are 53 snakes and 57 fish that haven't hidden.
Response:  We know that there are 3 snakes and 75 fish in the enclosure initially. If 82 additional snakes and 19 additional fish hide themselves, then the total number of snakes is now 82 + 3 = 85. The total number of fish is now 75 + 19 = 94. So, among the original 75 fish, 19 have hidden themselves, leaving 56 without hiding.
Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 79 animals in the box, and among them, 24 are snakes and 51 are fish. So, the total number of animals that have hidden themselves is 24 + 51 = 75. Therefore, there are 75 - 79 = -4 animals that haven't hidden themselves.
"Response: 
Yesterday, he picked 134 tomatoes, so there were 171 - 134 = 37 tomatoes left in the garden.
Today, he picked 30 more tomatoes, so there are now 37 + 30 = 67 tomatoes left in the garden after today.
Therefore, there are 67 tomatoes left in the farmer's garden at the end of today."
Response:  The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he picked 56 of them yesterday. So, there were 160 - 56 = 104 tomatoes left in the garden yesterday evening. Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes, so now there are 104 + 41 = 145 tomatoes left in the garden.
Response:  The farmer had 90 tomatoes in his garden yesterday and he picked 154 yesterday. So, the total number of tomatoes he picked is 90 + 154 = 244. Today, he picked 50 more tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes he has picked today is 244 + 50 = 294. Therefore, the farmer has picked a total of 294 tomatoes.
Response:  If he has 175 tomatoes and takes away 172 potatoes, then he still has how many? So, the number of tomatoes left = Total tomatoes - Number taken = 175 - 172 = 3. Similarly, if he has 77 potatoes and takes away 172, then he still has how many? So, the number of potatoes left = Total potatoes - Number taken = 77 - 172 = -95. Therefore, there are 3 tomatoes and -95 potatoes left.
Response:  The farmer has 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes initially. If he picks 53 tomatoes, then he has 177 - 53 = 124 tomatoes left. Similarly, if he has 12 potatoes initially, then he has 12 - 0 = 12 potatoes left after picking none. Therefore, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left in his garden.
Response:  The farmer has 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes initially. If he picks 137 tomatoes in total, then he must have picked some of both colors. Let's assume that he picked x green tomatoes and y red tomatoes. We know that x + y = 137 (total number of tomatoes picked) and x + y = 105 + 71 (initial number of green and red tomatoes). Solving for x and y, we get: x = 42 and y = 95. So, there are 42 green tomatoes left and 95 red tomatoes left after the farmer picks 137 tomatoes.
Response:  John needs to use 4 nails to fix the wall panels of the house. Each panel requires 2 nails for fixing. Therefore, the total number of nails needed is 4 x 2 = 8 nails. So, John needs 8 wood panels to build the wall of the house.
"Response:  John needs to use 13 blocks of wood for the wall, and each block requires 17 nails to fix it in place. So he needs 

$$ = \text {13} \times \text{17} = 201 $$
nails to fix all the big wooden planks. Additionally, there are some smaller wooden planks that need 8 nails each, so he needs an additional 

$$ = \text {8} \times \text{4} = 32 $$
nails for those. Therefore, John needs a total of 

$$ = \text {201} + \text {32} = 233 $$
nails to build the wall."
Response:  John needs to use 11 nails to fix the wall panels of his house. If each panel requires 3 nails, then he will need 11 / 3 = 3 panels. Since there are 8 extra nails used, we can deduce that John has built 3 + 8 = 11 panels in total. Therefore, John needs 11 panels to build the wall of his house.
Response:  John needs to use 12 big wood planks and 10 small wood planks for the wall of his house. The big wood planks require 15 nails to fix them, while the small ones need 5 nails each. Therefore, in total, John will need 15 + 5 x 10 = 75 nails to build the wall.
Response:  John needs to use 16 wood planks for building the wall of his house. Each plank requires 2 nails to fix it in place. Therefore, John needs 16 x 2 = 32 nails to build the wall.
"Response:  If John needs to use 74 nails for each wood plank, and he has 8 wood planks in total, then he will need:

74 x 8 = 580 nails

So, John needs 580 nails to build the wall with 8 wood planks."
Response:  John needs to build a wall with 12 big wood planks and 17 small wood planks. Each big wood plank requires 14 nails for fixing, so he needs 12 x 14 = 168 nails for the big planks. Similarly, each small wood plank requires 25 nails, so he needs 17 x 25 = 425 nails for the small planks. In total, John needs 168 + 425 = 593 nails to fix all the wood planks in the wall. Therefore, he will need 12 + 17 = 29 wood planks to build the wall.
Response:  We know that there are 42 pieces of gum in total and each package contains 3 pieces of gum. So, we can write an equation as follows: 42 = x × 3, where x is the number of packages. Now, we need to solve for x. Can you do it?
"Response:  We know that there are 43 packages of candies and each package contains 23 pieces of candy. So, we have:

Number of packages = 43
Number of pieces in each package = 23
Total number of pieces = Number of packages x Number of pieces per package
= 43 x 23
= 1005
Now, we also know that Robin has 8 extra pieces of candy. So, the total number of pieces of candy that Robin has is:

Total number of pieces = 1005 + 8
= 1013
Therefore, Robin has 1013 pieces of candy in total."
"Response:  We know that each packaging has 7 pieces of gum and Robin also has 6 extra pieces of gum. So, in total, there are 7 + 6 = 13 pieces of gum from all packagings and Robin combined. Since there are 41 pieces of gum in total, we can divide 41 by 13 to get the number of packagings: 41 / 13 = 3.
Therefore, Robin has 3 packages of gum."
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of candies and each package contains 4 blocks of candy. So, we have: Number of blocks = Total number of packages x Number of blocks per package = 28 x 4 = 112 blocks of candy. Therefore, Robin has 112 blocks of mouthwash.
Response:  We know that there are 21 bags of candy and each bag contains 9 pieces of candy. Therefore, the total number of candies is: 21 x 9 = 189. So, Robin has 189 pieces of candy.
Response:  We know that there are 28 packages of candies and each package contains 6 blocks. So, we have: Number of packages = 28 Total number of blocks = 28 x 6 = 168 Now, let's find out how many blocks Robin has in total. According to the question, Robin has 14 packages of candy. If each package contains 6 blocks, then the total number of blocks Robin has is: Number of blocks for Robin = 14 x 6 = 84 Therefore, Robin has 84 blocks in total.
Response:  If one industrial machine can produce 3 shirts per minute and has produced a total of 6 shirts, then we know that it worked for x minutes to produce those 6 shirts. We can write an equation as follows: 3x = 6 Where 'x' is the number of minutes the machine worked. Now, we need to solve this equation to find out how many minutes the machine worked. To do so, divide both sides of the equation by 3: 3x = 6 ÷ 3 = 2 So, the machine worked for 2 minutes to produce 6 shirts. Therefore, the answer is (2) minutes.
Response:  If this machine works for 5 minutes and can produce 4 shirts per minute, then it produces 20 shirts in total (5 minutes x 4 shirts/minute). So, the answer is 20 shirts.
Response:  The machine produced 9 pieces of shirts yesterday and 44 pieces today. So, the total number of pieces it has produced in one day is 9 + 44 = 53 pieces. Since each minute, the machine can produce 3 pieces of shirts, so the time taken to produce these 53 pieces will be 53 / 3 = 17 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 17 minutes yesterday.
Response:  The machine produced 13 pieces of shirts yesterday and 3 pieces today. So, the total number of pieces of shirts produced is 13 + 3 = 16. Since each minute, the machine can produce 8 pieces of shirts, so in total minutes, it worked for 16 / 8 = 20 minutes. Therefore, the answer is 20 minutes.
Response:  The machine produced 9 pieces of shirts yesterday and 8 pieces today. So, the total number of pieces it has produced is 9 + 8 = 17. Since each minute, the machine can produce 2 pieces of shirts, so in total minutes worked, we have: Total minutes worked = Number of pieces produced / Minutes per piece = 17 / 2 = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for approximately 8.5 minutes today.
Response:  The machine can produce 3 pieces per minute yesterday and today it produced 8 pieces. So, the total number of minutes worked is: (3 x 60) + (8 x 60) = 210 minutes.
Response:  Yesterday, the machine worked for 12 minutes and produced 6 pieces of shirts per minute. So it produced 6 x 12 = 72 pieces of shirts yesterday. Today, the machine worked for 14 minutes and produced 6 pieces of shirts per minute again. Therefore, it produced 6 x 14 = 84 pieces of shirts today. In total, the machine has produced 72 + 84 = 156 pieces of shirts.
Response:  Yesterday, it worked for 5 minutes and produced 6 pieces of shirts per minute. So yesterday, it produced 30 (6 x 5) pieces of shirts. Today, it worked for 1 hour = 60 minutes, so it produced 6 x 60 = 360 pieces of shirts today. Therefore, the answer is 360.
Response:  If they earned $165 in total and played for 5 days, then we can calculate their daily earnings as follows: Daily Earning = Total Earnings / Number of Days = $165 / 5 = $33 per day
Response:  The daily income from playing the game is $144 per day. Since they attended the carnival for 22 days, their total income can be calculated as follows: Total Income = Daily Income x Number of Days = $144 x 22 = $3,088 So, the answer is $3,088.
"Response:  We know that in total, they earned $420 from playing the game every day for 30 days and $22 from other games. So, the amount of money they earned per day from the game is:
$420 / 30 = $14 per day
Therefore, the daily earnings from the game are $14."
Response:  The total amount of money earned in the carnival is equal to the sum of the amounts earned during the first 44 days and the remaining 10 days. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Amount = First 44 Days + Remaining 10 Days Now, let's calculate the amounts earned during each period: During the first 44 days, $382 was earned (given). During the remaining 10 days, $374 was earned (given) Therefore, we can substitute these values into our equation: Total Amount = $382 + $374 = $756 Thus, the total amount of money earned in the carnival is $756.
Response:  We know that in the first 20 days of the carnival, the person earned $120. In the remaining 16 days, they earned $66, for a total of $186. So, the amount earned per day during the first 20 days is: $120 / 20 = $6 per day.
Response:  We know that in the first 154 days of the year, they earned $325. In the remaining 57 days, they earned $114 per day. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total amount earned = Number of days x Daily earning Total amount earned = 154 x $325 + 57 x $114 Total amount earned = $50,890 + $6,314 Total amount earned = $57,204 Therefore, they earned $57,204 in the remaining 57 days of the year.
Response:  According to the question, Rossi bought 10 packages of crackers and 4 packages of cakes. So she bought a total of 10 + 4 = 14 packages. Therefore, she bought more packages of crackers than cakes. The difference between the number of packages of crackers and cakes is 14 - 4 = 10.
"Response: 

Leah bought 4 packs of crackers, which means she bought 4 x 10 = 40 crackers in total.
She also bought 22 packages of cookies, which means she bought 22 x 5 = 110 cookies in total.
Finally, she bought 16 packets of chocolate, which means she bought 16 x 8 = 128 chocolates in total.
So, Leah bought a total of 40 + 110 + 128 = 378 packages of snacks in total."
Response:  We know that Rossi bought 23 packages of crackers and some bread rolls. So far, she has 23 + 1 = 24 items in total. Then we are told that she went to the store again and bought more stuff, including bread rolls. This means that she now has 24 + x = 27 items in total, where x is the number of bread rolls she bought. Since she already had 23 packages of crackers, the only thing left for her to buy were bread rolls. Therefore, x = 4. So Rossi has 24 + 4 = 28 items in total.
"Response: 

Rosie bought 2 packs of crackers and 12 packages of cakes. Each package of crackers contains 4 crackers, and each package of cakes contains 3 cakes. Therefore, Rosie bought a total of:

Crackers: 2 x 4 = 8 crackers
Cakes: 12 x 3 = 36 cakes

So, in total, Rosie bought 8 + 36 = 44 packages of snacks."
Response:  At first, there were 12 people in the public bus. Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next station, so now there are 12 + 4 = 16 people in total. Since each bus can carry up to 36 passengers, we know that there cannot be more than 36 people in any one bus. Therefore, the number of people currently on the bus is 16 - 36 = -20 people. In other words, there are no people on the bus right now.
Response:  At first, there were 8 people in the public bus. Then, 12 more people boarded the bus at the next stop, so now there are 8 + 12 = 20 people in the bus. Later, 3 people got off the bus, leaving 20 - 3 = 17 people in the bus. Therefore, there are currently 17 people in the public bus.
Response:  At first, there were 4 people in the bus. Then, 9 more people got on the bus at station 13, so now there are 4 + 9 = 13 people in the bus.
Response:  At first, there were 11 people on the train. Then, 8 more people got on the train. So, in total, there are now 11 + 8 = 19 people on the train.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 parents and 676 people in total. To find out how many students participated in this project, we need to divide the number of parents by the number of family members each parent represents (i.e., their children). So, let's assume that each parent has an average of 3-4 children. Therefore, the number of students who participated in this project is:

Number of students = Number of parents x Average number of children per parent
= 22 x 3.5 (assuming an average of 3.5 children per parent)
= 74 students
Therefore, approximately 74 students participated in this project."
"Response:  We know that there are 73 parents, 724 students, and 744 teachers in this activity. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Parents + Students + Teachers = Total number of people
= 73 + 724 + 744
= 1531
Therefore, there are 1531 people in this activity."
Response:  According to the given information, there are 174 parents and 521 students in total. To find out how many students attended school, we need to divide the number of students by the number of parents. So, the answer is: Number of students who attended school = 521 / 174 = 306.
"Response:  We know that there are 61 parents and 177 students participating in this activity. The seating capacity of the venue is 44 people. To find out how many people cannot attend the event, we need to subtract the number of available seats from the total number of participants. Therefore, the number of people who cannot attend the event is:

61 parents + 177 students = 238

Available seating capacity = 44

So, the number of people who cannot attend the event is:

238 - 44 = 194

Therefore, there are 194 people who cannot attend the event."
"Response:  If they need to travel 1307 feet after walking 919 feet into the cave, then the distance from the entrance of the cave to its end is:

Distance = 1307 - 919 = 488 feet
Therefore, the cave's end is 488 feet away from the entrance."
Response:  The distance they have already traveled is given as 849 feet. If they are traveling at a rate of 17 feet per hour, then in one hour, they will have traveled 17 x 60 = 1020 feet. Therefore, to reach the end of the cave, they will need to travel another 1218 - 849 = 369 feet. So, it will take them approximately 369 / 17 = 21 hours to reach the end of the cave.
"Response:  If they are currently at 659 feet and the depth of the cave is 762 feet, then they have already traveled 103 feet (762 - 659) into the cave. To find out how far they need to go to reach the end of the cave, we can divide the total depth of the cave (762 feet) by the distance they have already traveled (103 feet):

Distance to reach the end = Total depth / Distance traveled = 762 ft / 103 ft = 7.4 miles

Therefore, they still need to travel approximately 7.4 miles to reach the end of the cave."
"Response:  
Initially, there were 8 goldfish in the pond (according to the question).
The stray cat liked to eat goldfish and ate 2 of them.
So, now there are 8 - 2 = 6 goldfish left in the pond.
Therefore, 6 goldfish have disappeared or ""disappeared""."
"Response:  
Pechy has 7 goldfish and 12 carp in the pond. The stray cat likes to eat them. Now Pechy only has 15 fish left. 
So, the number of fish that disappeared is: 7 + 12 = 19."
Response:  We know that 佩奇 initially had 16 goldfish and 71 carp in the pond. The stray cat liked to eat them, so some of them disappeared. Now, according to the question, only 2 goldfish are left. So, we can calculate the number of missing goldfish as follows: Number of missing goldfish = Initial number of goldfish - Number of remaining goldfish = 16 - 2 = 14 Therefore, 14 goldfish have disappeared.
Response:  We know that 佩奇 initially had 15 goldfish in the pond and that 5 of them were eaten by the stray cat. So, the number of remaining goldfish is: 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, there are 10 goldfish left in the pond.
Response:  The chef initially had 43 apples and made some dumplings using 15 of them. So he has 43 - 15 = 28 apples left. Now, he gives 2 apples to his friend. Therefore, he has 28 - 2 = 26 apples left.
Response:  The chef had 58 apples initially and did some preparation work that used up 35 of them. So, how many apples are left? We can calculate this as follows: Total number of apples = Initial amount of apples - Amount used for preparation = 58 - 35 = 23 apples. Therefore, there are 23 apples left.
Response:  The chef had 40 apples and 54 plums initially. After making some jam, he was left with 39 fruits in total (including both apples and plums). So, the number of apples used = Total fruits - Number of fruits left = 39 - 40 = -1 apple. Therefore, the chef used 1 apple to make the jam.
"Response: 
Adam has four shelves and each shelf can hold 11 action figures. Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam can have is:
4 x 11 = 44
So, Adam can have up to 44 action figures in his room."
"Response: 
Adam has 10 action figures that he can place on each shelf in his room. Since his room can accommodate 8 action figures, we need to divide 10 by 8 to find out how many shelves Adam has in his room. Therefore, the number of shelves in Adam's room is 10/8 = 1 and 1/3 or 1.375 shelves."
"Response: 
Adam has 8 action figures and each figure can hold up to 10 boxes. So, Adam can have a total of 8 x 10 = 80 boxes.
Since there are 4 shelves in Adam's room, he can place 4 x 80 = 320 boxes in his room."
Response:  We know that there are 544 flowerpots in each garden and each flowerpot contains 32 flowers. So, we can calculate the total number of flowers as follows: Total Number of Flowers = Number of Flowerpots x Number of Flowers per Pot = 544 x 32 = 17608 flowers. Therefore, there are 17608 flowers in each garden.
Response:  There are 466 flowerpots in total. Each flowerpot contains 53 flowers and 181 sticks. Therefore, the total number of flowers is 466 x 53 = 24,908 flowers. The total number of sticks is 466 x 181 = 87,666 sticks. So there are 24,908 flowers and 87,666 sticks in total.
Response:  We know that there are 141 flowerpots in total and each pot contains 71 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is 141 x 71 = 9671 flowers. Now, we also know that each pot has 91 sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks is 9671 x 91 = 88531 sticks. 
Response:  If there are 40 flowers in each pot and total number of flowers is 400, then we can calculate the number of pots as follows: Number of pots = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per pot = 400 / 40 = 10. So, there are 10 flowerpots.
"Response:  We know that there are 4502 pieces of rainbow sugar in Steven's collection and 4276 erasers. If we divide them into groups of 154, then the number of groups is:

Number of groups = Total number of items / Number per group
= 4502 + 4276
/ 154
= 3098

So, there will be 3098 groups with 4502 pieces of rainbow sugar and 4276 erasers if they are divided into groups of 154 each."
"Response:  If we have 4950 rubber wipes and want to divide them into groups of 495 each, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total number of groups that can be formed with 4950 rubber wipes.
Total number of groups = Number of rubber wipes / Number of rubber wipes per group
= 4950 / 495
= 10

So, there will be 10 groups of rubber wipes."
Response:  We know that Steven has 896 rainbow candies in total. If we divide them into groups of 8, then each group will have 112 rainbow candies (8 x 112 = 896).
Response:  If there are 270 students in total and each year has 5 students, then we can calculate the number of years as follows: Number of students = Total students / Number of students per year = 270 / 5 = 54 years. Therefore, there are 54 different grades or year levels at this school.
Response:  We know that there are 304 grades in total and each grade has 75 students. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total number of students = Number of grades x Number of students per grade To find out how many students there are in total, we need to multiply the number of grades (304) by the number of students per grade (75). Therefore, the total number of students is equal to 304 x 75 = 22,500 students.
